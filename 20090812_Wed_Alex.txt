[00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:06.115]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:07.896]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:09.636]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.636 --> 00:00:11.237]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:12.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:16.978]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:21.019]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:40.907]  Well, we've been front page of the Drudge Report, one of the top stories since last night.
[00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:46.270]  It is all over TV, all over radio, exactly as we had planned.
[00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.173]  That's the reason I did the whole Joker bit.
[00:00:52.173 --> 00:00:57.036]  Because I don't take myself too seriously sometimes, I did it to promote the contest.
[00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:01.358]  And I did tell people last week, and on the Sunday Show, and yesterday,
[00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:12.491]  Please put it in the commons area, light poles, telephone poles, in the bar districts, on the bulletin boards.
[00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.293]  Don't do anything uncivil.
[00:01:14.293 --> 00:01:15.434]  Check your local laws.
[00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:26.448]  But the media is saying it's an act of vandalism, an act of terrorism, and they get to whine and suck their thumbs out of hundreds of cities.
[00:01:26.448 --> 00:01:41.472]  I mean, we're talking Belfast, Ireland, London, England, Sheffield, England, Moscow, Russia, Tokyo, Japan, San Antonio, Texas, Dallas, Texas, San Diego, Los Angeles, Seattle, Kansas City, St.
[00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:43.733]  Louis, Indianapolis, Indiana.
[00:01:45.302 --> 00:01:45.942]  Everywhere!
[00:01:45.942 --> 00:01:48.904]  I mean, the videos are pouring in.
[00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:50.845]  Hundreds of them.
[00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:53.187]  And I'd say 98% of the videos, I've seen a couple.
[00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.031]  98% looked at the contest rules and are following them, haven't been too overzealous.
[00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:04.512]  You're putting them on power poles, common areas, hanging them up over other broadsheets.
[00:02:04.512 --> 00:02:07.333]  That's what I said, hang them up in those high traffic areas.
[00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:15.555]  And so when they try to whine and suck their thumb and say, you need to be arrested, you can go, oh, did you call for arresting all these rock and roll posters and
[00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:30.325]  Church posters, and broadsheets, and local ads for the Five and Dime, or the Swap Meet, or the Flea Market, or the Lost Cat, or the Lost Dog, or the Missing Persons.
[00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:32.086]  We posted a bunch of these photos.
[00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:39.610]  You can just Google, handbills on wall, or flyers on power pole, or light pole.
[00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.850]  You'll get thousands of images.
[00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.071]  You've all seen them.
[00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:43.832]  I mean, what pole
[00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:52.935]  What wouldn't pull in a town or city doesn't have I knew because I always thought it was almost a work of art.
[00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:56.501]  I knew that when I said when I googled nails in.
[00:02:58.018 --> 00:03:05.804]  Telephone pole, that it would be art, that photographers, because I've seen it many times and thought, that looks like a work of art.
[00:03:05.804 --> 00:03:17.933]  All these thousands of individual, diverse nails, different types, nailed in different ways, some crooked, some straight, old pieces of metal, ripped off, staples.
[00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:24.658]  I remember when I was putting them up last week, dressed as the Joker in South Austin on Old Torf,
[00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:29.318]  This is a work of art.
[00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:38.781]  So this morning when I called Watson up and I said, I'm going to send you some images of people that have taken photographs of nails as art.
[00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:55.006]  I mean, people put so many posters up, so many broadsheets up that from eight feet in the air down to two feet in the air on the side of the pole, it's just solid nails and staples.
[00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:56.086]  And I think it's kind of pretty.
[00:03:57.848 --> 00:04:02.150]  And I'm glad other people think the same thing.
[00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.071]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:10.073]  I'll probably be arrested because I try to be artistic.
[00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:10.893]  I'm evil.
[00:04:10.893 --> 00:04:11.413]  I'm bad.
[00:04:11.413 --> 00:04:15.395]  It's okay to put the sign up saying you've got a garage sale.
[00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:18.756]  But don't you put an image up of Barack Obama as the Joker.
[00:04:19.895 --> 00:04:28.319]  And then there's the whole hypocritical angle of you can show Bush as a vampire, a demon, a devil, a joker, that's fine.
[00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:34.482]  In fact, we even found old clip art where they'd had programs hanging him up on power poles.
[00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.122]  That's okay.
[00:04:36.122 --> 00:04:39.044]  But no, they're on the news saying we need to be arrested.
[00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:42.184]  Oh, yes sir!
[00:04:42.184 --> 00:04:43.585]  You don't hang up!
[00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:47.206]  Our lord, our savior, Barack H. Obama.
[00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:58.272]  We'll go over all this, play some of the news clips, tell you about all the big guests we got in line today, like Steve Quayle, and we got the fella that made the big stir with the gun outside the Obama event.
[00:04:58.272 --> 00:04:58.812]  He's coming on.
[00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:01.308]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.308 --> 00:05:03.290]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.271]  Well, you should.
[00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:08.776]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:09.577]  That's right.
[00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:18.247]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[00:05:18.247 --> 00:05:19.608]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:19.608 --> 00:05:20.750]  Plus, if you act fast.
[00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.934]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:33.818]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[00:05:33.818 --> 00:05:39.342]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[00:05:39.342 --> 00:05:40.803]  This is real.
[00:05:40.803 --> 00:05:41.863]  Don't miss out.
[00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:48.728]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:50.410]  And get your free handgun.

[00:05:59.701 --> 00:05:59.882]  You!
[00:06:01.246 --> 00:06:07.291]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.291 --> 00:06:13.155]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:19.320]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.620]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.081]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:37.264]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:38.944]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.944 --> 00:06:40.805]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:47.046]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:57.557]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.557 --> 00:06:58.758]  The people strike back!
[00:07:00.976 --> 00:07:09.939]  Did you know that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles, wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:12.580]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.321]  This book is for you!
[00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:19.723]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth, and it's called, Here's What You Do.

[00:07:29.987 --> 00:07:31.248]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:31.248 --> 00:07:35.791]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:41.615]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:07:41.615 --> 00:07:45.257]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:47.979]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:53.043]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:53.283]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:54.684]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:00.467 --> 00:08:05.869]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:08.110]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:21.875]  Alright, we got Paul Watson, the author of this presentplanet.com story joining us in T-minus 23 minutes.
[00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:27.777]  Exercising First Amendment, now vandalism as corporate media attacks Obama Joker contest.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.303]  Drudge Report carrying its top story since last night.
[00:08:34.303 --> 00:08:38.687]  One of its top stories in the top row.
[00:08:38.687 --> 00:08:40.709]  And it goes on from there.
[00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:46.334]  Obama says grandmother's hip replacement raises cost questions.
[00:08:46.334 --> 00:08:47.135]  That's Bloomberg.
[00:08:47.135 --> 00:08:50.458]  Yeah, I can't let grandma have that hip replacement.
[00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:54.462]  You just go off and get on an ice floe lady and go die, according to them.
[00:08:54.462 --> 00:08:55.123]  Obama sees
[00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:00.260]  Threat at these town halls and AP weighs in.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.641]  Officials see rise in militia groups across the US.
[00:09:03.641 --> 00:09:13.543]  This is the new pre-government inaugural bombing where they're going to bomb themselves so everybody feels sorry for the government so they can raise new taxes on us.
[00:09:13.543 --> 00:09:14.643]  That's the big news today.
[00:09:14.643 --> 00:09:17.404]  I'm going to be going over that.
[00:09:17.404 --> 00:09:24.786]  Also when Steve Quayle joins us coming up in an hour, Obama says
[00:09:26.621 --> 00:09:37.931]  That we all need to take three to four of the new genetically engineered, cloned, it's cloned, that's how they can come out with vaccines in a month or two instead of six months in the old-fashioned way of doing it.
[00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:44.918]  This is one of the top German magazines, Bild.
[00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:45.658]  Does virus
[00:09:46.874 --> 00:09:52.676]  Vaccine increased the risk of cancer, and it's grown in cancer viruses.
[00:09:52.676 --> 00:10:01.079]  And I tried to explain to people that the Rockefellers by the twenties, under research they were funding, discovered that most cancer was viral.
[00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:06.361]  So they set up the cancer research organizations in the country.
[00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:09.702]  One in a couple hundred people would die of cancer then.
[00:10:09.702 --> 00:10:12.563]  By the fifties it was one in thirty-three, it's now one in two.
[00:10:12.563 --> 00:10:14.024]  It was one in three, it's now one in two.
[00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:17.384]  Cancer's like getting a cold now.
[00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:22.207]  And so, they put the cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:10:22.207 --> 00:10:25.249]  They're also communicable once someone has the vaccine in them.
[00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:29.252]  I mean, this is mainstream news, but it's in the news today again.
[00:10:29.252 --> 00:10:35.416]  And then, you get cancer, and then they extract all of your life savings in the expense of cancer treatments.
[00:10:35.416 --> 00:10:37.258]  I mean, these people are geniuses.
[00:10:37.258 --> 00:10:40.260]  Very twisted, very wicked, ultimately evil.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.981]  They funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:43.302]  They funded Adolf Hitler.
[00:10:43.302 --> 00:10:44.583]  That's Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:56.515]  They funded all the major eugenics, they fund Holdren, they fund Ted Turner, they fund Bill Gates, they fund Margaret Sanger, they currently are the main funders of Planned Parenthood.
[00:10:56.515 --> 00:10:59.337]  I mean, they funded all!
[00:10:59.337 --> 00:11:04.521]  And so, roll your sleeve up, David Rockefeller, Senator Rockefeller have got a prize for you.
[00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:11.307]  They make Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Jeffrey Dahmer look like disciples of Christ.
[00:11:13.905 --> 00:11:16.327]  And I risk my life every day telling you about them.
[00:11:16.327 --> 00:11:18.969]  I do everything I can to expose these people.
[00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:21.512]  Believe me, I can't deal with the fact.
[00:11:21.512 --> 00:11:24.474]  It totally shakes me up every day.
[00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:25.355]  But I don't run.
[00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:27.857]  I flee forward.
[00:11:27.857 --> 00:11:30.779]  And that's why I get more aggressive, more in their face every day.
[00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:35.984]  And it's a response to being in the battle front lines every day.
[00:11:35.984 --> 00:11:40.368]  I mean, I'm not running from them, so I'm getting wilder and wilder in my confrontations with them.
[00:11:41.124 --> 00:11:44.206]  And that doesn't mean that I've got all the answers or even doing a good job.
[00:11:44.206 --> 00:11:46.548]  I'm just throwing myself at them, you know?
[00:11:46.548 --> 00:11:47.349]  Doing the best I can.
[00:11:47.349 --> 00:11:50.471]  It's really that simple.
[00:11:50.471 --> 00:11:54.033]  I mean, I look at it this way.
[00:11:54.033 --> 00:11:56.375]  I'm risking my life, my name, everything in this fight.
[00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:58.957]  I might as well go 110%.
[00:11:58.957 --> 00:12:08.024]  Does that mean every punch I throw, every kick I launch, every karate chop to the neck of tyranny I take,
[00:12:09.133 --> 00:12:16.336]  Is gonna be thrown just right or gonna strike home or gonna have the proper effect?
[00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:20.938]  No, but it means this, I'm going 110% tooth and nail.
[00:12:20.938 --> 00:12:25.861]  That means I'm biting, I'm scratching, I'm headbutting, I'm ramming right into them.
[00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:34.444]  And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, if you just research these sickos writings and what they've done and what they're doing, you would decide to take action as well.
[00:12:34.444 --> 00:12:35.505]  There is no other way.
[00:12:40.205 --> 00:12:46.048]  And a lot of people criticize me because at a subconscious level, they are afraid of fighting tyranny.
[00:12:46.048 --> 00:12:49.490]  And at a subconscious level, they're afraid of committing.
[00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:54.813]  And at a subconscious level, they are threatened by someone who is a wild man.
[00:12:54.813 --> 00:13:03.018]  But we all have to unloose that human spirit.
[00:13:03.018 --> 00:13:05.820]  We all have to take action if we love our families.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.442]  We have to break the spell we're under, the mesmerized trance we're under.
[00:13:14.136 --> 00:13:18.480]  And get it on!
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.822]  I mean, it's time.
[00:13:20.822 --> 00:13:26.546]  It's time to stand up and speak out and have your voice be heard loud.
[00:13:26.546 --> 00:13:32.411]  It's time the enemy hear your war growl and see your war face.
[00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:33.872]  It's time they know.
[00:13:33.872 --> 00:13:35.193]  And believe me, they're scared now.
[00:13:35.193 --> 00:13:38.056]  I've been really watching a lot of television to track enemy operations.
[00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:56.080]  It is torture, and I only do it when I already see other indicators that they're getting ready to launch staged terror attacks, because I can get more accused of actually watching them than just reading the transcripts of what they read off the teleprompters.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.882]  I get a lot from that, but it adds another dimension to actually watch them.
[00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:05.585]  And I watched over an hour of television this morning, and I can give you a report on that here in a moment.
[00:14:05.585 --> 00:14:06.986]  Anyways, let me tell you what we've got coming up today.
[00:14:06.986 --> 00:14:08.247]  We have the gentleman coming on
[00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:17.286]  It's not really a retraction, but it is, it's a clarification.
[00:14:17.286 --> 00:14:27.154]  We said, maybe a patriot out there down the road, people do wear guns openly, and I think it's a good thing to exercise the Second Amendment, because if you don't exercise it openly and proudly,
[00:14:28.072 --> 00:14:42.003]  You lose it, and I've commended people that do wear firearms openly, which is legal and lawful in almost every state, but the public's been conditioned that isn't the case, so it's good to break those taboos, and you've got incredible courage, and I salute you.
[00:14:42.003 --> 00:14:52.911]  But the way Chris Matthews and others were reporting it, they were acting like there was somebody out there right in the crowd with Obama with a gun, and I said, if the Secret Service allowed that, this has got to be staged.
[00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:55.994]  And then I saw the earpiece, and the guy was clean cut, and I said,
[00:14:57.506 --> 00:15:00.847]  That might be some foundation person or some merc or who knows.
[00:15:00.847 --> 00:15:02.188]  I said, or it may be a patriot.
[00:15:02.188 --> 00:15:11.071]  But then we soon learned from Gary Franchi that he knows the fella and that he was down the road at private property that was putting on a demonstration.
[00:15:11.071 --> 00:15:15.793]  And I just salute him and he's coming on the last 30 minutes to do it.
[00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:19.915]  But even that type of bold courage even shocks me sometimes.
[00:15:19.915 --> 00:15:20.135]  And, uh,
[00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:30.695]  The establishment tried to use it as propaganda, but this gentleman went on hardball and absolutely skewered Matthews, because what Matthews does is he does tests.
[00:15:30.695 --> 00:15:34.417]  He loves the fact that he knows a lot of history and is intelligent.
[00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:39.000]  And so he'll sit there and throw things out, and if you're wrong, he'll scream at you and say you're wrong.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.525]  And he does it to politicians, he did it to State Senator Kirk Watson once famously, when Watson didn't even know one of Obama's foreign policy issues.
[00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:50.616]  And Matthew, of course, can look really smart.
[00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.222]  He also pre-scripts what he's going to say.
[00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:59.679]  But this guy knew every historical issue, every quote, and Matthews is one of these classic eugenicists, elitists.
[00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:03.121]  He suddenly got respectful and said, oh, you're actually a human being.
[00:16:03.121 --> 00:16:04.422]  Oh, okay, well, I see what you're saying.
[00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.063]  Okay, I respect you.
[00:16:06.063 --> 00:16:11.226]  It's very weird with these Georgetown elitists.
[00:16:11.226 --> 00:16:14.488]  It's like when they figure out you know, they suddenly get real nice.
[00:16:14.488 --> 00:16:18.051]  I mean, I've been around high-level elitists before, run into them at events.
[00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:25.674]  And they'll say a few tests to you, and as soon as you know facts, they go, oh, you're... They have really weird rules.
[00:16:25.674 --> 00:16:31.536]  It's a very, very strange crew.
[00:16:31.536 --> 00:16:36.459]  They actually admire those of us that fight them.
[00:16:36.459 --> 00:16:42.681]  But they say, you should join us, the cattle are too stupid.
[00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:44.182]  But see, I'm not going to be immoral.
[00:16:45.461 --> 00:16:46.821]  And sit there and feed off people.
[00:16:46.821 --> 00:17:01.425]  I don't want my children growing up in a country with a bunch of corrupt parasites that seek to limit human destiny and seek to limit human horizons and seek to limit the dynamic human spirit.
[00:17:01.425 --> 00:17:03.185]  I have a love affair with humanity.
[00:17:03.185 --> 00:17:08.667]  I have a love affair with art and literature and beauty and goodness and innocence.
[00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:12.968]  And I know how horrid I am, warts and all.
[00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:28.348]  I understand that, but I also know that we can reach for something better and something greater.
[00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:44.311]  And it is a great crime committed against the species and humanity that the elite, the controllers, the engineers, have studied how our species works and would play this wicked game of fraud and deception and dumbing down on their own people.
[00:17:46.843 --> 00:17:49.184]  And the elites try to say, well, we're a different group of people.
[00:17:49.184 --> 00:17:50.245]  We're a different species.
[00:17:50.245 --> 00:17:55.468]  We're homo sapien, sapien, you know, superb.
[00:17:55.468 --> 00:17:57.769]  Or homo sapien, sapien, illuminated.
[00:17:57.769 --> 00:18:02.432]  They have different terms they use.
[00:18:02.432 --> 00:18:13.258]  And if you were really homo sapien, sapien, illuminous, as you say you are, you wouldn't be trying to dumb people down and poison them.
[00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:21.414]  Poison them culturally and chemically.
[00:18:21.414 --> 00:18:26.597]  Yeah, you got sunshine coming out of you, but it's black sunshine right out of hell.
[00:18:26.597 --> 00:18:28.938]  Alright, again, Steve Quayle coming up.
[00:18:28.938 --> 00:18:30.759]  The gentleman that went out there with the gun.
[00:18:30.759 --> 00:18:34.221]  We got Darryl Rundus popping in.
[00:18:34.221 --> 00:18:36.062]  He's launching YouDoNews today.
[00:18:36.062 --> 00:18:37.003]  YouDoNews.com.
[00:18:37.003 --> 00:18:37.563]  Very exciting.
[00:18:37.563 --> 00:18:39.284]  We'll be uploading some of our videos there.
[00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.525]  Very proud of what Darryl's doing.
[00:18:40.525 --> 00:18:40.945]  Great guy.
[00:18:44.093 --> 00:18:54.417]  And we'll be able to talk to Steve Quayle for much of the two hours about does virus, does vaccine virus increase the risk of cancer?
[00:18:54.417 --> 00:19:01.500]  The swine flu vaccine has been hit with new cancer fears that for German health expert, they have a shock warning about its safety.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.842]  That's a major, huge German investigative publication.
[00:19:05.842 --> 00:19:07.303]  Very respected.
[00:19:07.303 --> 00:19:10.724]  Build.de is the website.
[00:19:13.459 --> 00:19:23.681]  And I told you, uh, what yesterday, that Helga, who's given us many good tips from Germany over the years, she previously lived in Austin, Texas.
[00:19:23.681 --> 00:19:26.642]  She's a German.
[00:19:26.642 --> 00:19:28.822]  Immigrated to the United States.
[00:19:28.822 --> 00:19:34.703]  But, uh, she moved back to Germany.
[00:19:34.703 --> 00:19:38.764]  She told us this and then it did end up popping up in the news.
[00:19:43.168 --> 00:19:44.269]  Yeah, she told us that on Monday.
[00:19:44.269 --> 00:19:46.292]  This came out on Tuesday.
[00:19:46.292 --> 00:19:52.680]  She heard this on National German News Radio, but here it is in the newspaper.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.367]  Okay, we'll come back and go over the fact that we're on the Drugs Report.
[00:19:57.367 --> 00:19:58.849]  Thanks to everybody out there taking action.
[00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:02.032]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.032 --> 00:20:07.614]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:12.636]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:20:12.636 --> 00:20:17.658]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:20:18.198 --> 00:20:23.422]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:25.743]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:20:25.743 --> 00:20:30.546]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:20:30.546 --> 00:20:31.667]  And here's the best part.
[00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:34.729]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:20:34.729 --> 00:20:38.352]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:20:38.352 --> 00:20:41.554]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:41.554 --> 00:20:43.775]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:44.696]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:20:48.338 --> 00:20:52.561]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:20:52.561 --> 00:20:57.385]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:20:57.385 --> 00:21:01.048]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:21:01.048 --> 00:21:03.509]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:03.509 --> 00:21:05.291]  A new world order.
[00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:10.194]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:10.194 --> 00:21:13.036]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:13.036 --> 00:21:15.218]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:15.785 --> 00:21:18.971]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:26.303]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:29.315 --> 00:21:34.759]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:38.641]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:38.641 --> 00:21:41.203]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:41.203 --> 00:21:42.364]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:42.364 --> 00:21:43.164]  They're not after money.
[00:21:43.164 --> 00:21:44.425]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:44.425 --> 00:21:45.406]  They're after power.
[00:21:45.406 --> 00:21:46.567]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:23:00.469 --> 00:23:01.730]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:03.591]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:05.413]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[00:23:05.413 --> 00:23:10.316]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[00:23:10.316 --> 00:23:14.920]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.260]  We're good to go.
[00:23:45.589 --> 00:23:46.010]  Call 1-800-210-1922.

[00:23:49.095 --> 00:23:50.879]  Start your healthy lifestyle now!
[00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:20.341]  I will bet my bottom dollar it is staged.
[00:24:20.341 --> 00:24:31.987]  How are they going to counter our operation nationwide, putting up Obama fascist, Obama socialist, Obama InfoWars.com, Joker posters, which has now gone viral in every town and city.
[00:24:31.987 --> 00:24:36.249]  I mean, we're getting thousands of emails, hundreds of calls.
[00:24:37.346 --> 00:24:41.770]  It's gotta be over a hundred videos we've been sent of people all over the world posting these.
[00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:50.059]  Suddenly Congress is being faxed the Obama poster with a swastika on his head with the n-word.
[00:24:50.059 --> 00:24:57.206]  And I bet, I bet my pinky
[00:24:59.548 --> 00:25:04.511]  Put it this way, 98% chance that the Democratic Party is doing this themselves.
[00:25:04.511 --> 00:25:21.222]  In fact, I need Curt Nemo, Paul Watson, whoever, to go get all these past articles in the last couple years, where mainly black college students, but also Jewish college students, paint swastikas on their dorm room, and do it on their house, and do it on the black church.
[00:25:21.222 --> 00:25:24.084]  I mean, every time, people do this to themselves.
[00:25:24.084 --> 00:25:25.005]  It's a false flag.
[00:25:26.874 --> 00:25:27.955]  Now, there are idiots.
[00:25:27.955 --> 00:25:31.477]  It may be a meth-head, one-toothed, white supremacist idiot.
[00:25:31.477 --> 00:25:34.118]  Those people certainly exist, but there's not very many of them.
[00:25:34.118 --> 00:25:36.540]  Believe me, I'm a white guy in Texas.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.543]  I used to go deer hunting and hog hunting and coyote hunting.
[00:25:41.543 --> 00:25:43.964]  I've been hunting Colorado, Texas, you name it.
[00:25:43.964 --> 00:25:47.166]  I've been around the campfire with rednecks hundreds of times.
[00:25:47.166 --> 00:25:48.247]  Never heard the N-word.
[00:25:48.247 --> 00:25:50.028]  Never heard people talk bad about black people.
[00:25:56.963 --> 00:25:57.283]  I don't know.
[00:25:57.283 --> 00:26:06.490]  I remember back when Jesse Jackson was running for president, being at a deer camp, and people going, I'd vote for him if he wouldn't raise my taxes, and if you don't like him, they say you're racist.
[00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:12.755]  I do have a vague memory of that, of people making biscuits and gravy at 5 a.m., about to go out and go hunting.
[00:26:12.755 --> 00:26:13.735]  And I do remember that.
[00:26:13.735 --> 00:26:16.858]  I have a memory of that, being about 10 years old.
[00:26:16.858 --> 00:26:19.179]  That dates me.
[00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:24.523]  It was that long ago that people like Jesse Jackson were running for president, 10, 12, I don't know, something like that.
[00:26:24.523 --> 00:26:25.264]  I was a little kid.
[00:26:29.131 --> 00:26:37.618]  But all those old guys have been around the world though.
[00:26:37.618 --> 00:26:39.879]  That was out on our property, family, friends hunting.
[00:26:39.879 --> 00:26:41.601]  All those old World War II vets are dead.
[00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:43.642]  Most of the Korean War vets were dead.
[00:26:43.642 --> 00:26:47.105]  Those were neat old guys to hang out with.
[00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:54.210]  You know, it's not about sitting up in a deer stand or up in a deer blind bow hunting or hunting with a rifle.
[00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:54.631]  It's about
[00:26:56.394 --> 00:27:01.596]  Just the primitive, ancient right of sitting around a campfire.
[00:27:01.596 --> 00:27:21.442]  But my issue is, nine times out of ten, and we have written big detailed articles about, I mean the Miami Heralds reported about top white supremacist leaders forming and leading the white supremacist groups, our government agents, and it came out in federal court that Hal Turner was a federal operative, but threatened too many people so they went ahead and burned him.
[00:27:21.442 --> 00:27:24.683]  Which is a word to the wise, all you feds out there.
[00:27:27.975 --> 00:27:30.436]  And Jewish guys like Al Turner.
[00:27:30.436 --> 00:27:36.678]  I mean, you should really know that you're just going to get set up doing that kind of stuff.
[00:27:36.678 --> 00:27:38.519]  Friends with Sean Hannity.
[00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:40.439]  It is despicable burning their own operative.
[00:27:40.439 --> 00:27:44.741]  I mean, it's admitted in court records he was a fed.
[00:27:44.741 --> 00:27:49.742]  But he threatened some state judges and they filed separate state charges and they don't care.
[00:27:49.742 --> 00:27:50.983]  They went and grabbed him.
[00:27:50.983 --> 00:27:51.963]  What a moron!
[00:27:51.963 --> 00:27:54.444]  Because those judges actually got death threats, you idiot!
[00:27:58.786 --> 00:28:06.847]  So, I'm getting death threats now and I'm getting scores of emails, I mean we didn't count them, probably 50, 60, 70, I don't know, going through them.
[00:28:06.847 --> 00:28:13.909]  Here's one from Chanda.
[00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:19.250]  If you, I think you should be thrown in jail for what you're trying to promote.
[00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:26.891]  He is and still will be the President of the United States and there is nothing that your white supremacist
[00:28:28.121 --> 00:28:30.262]  self can do about it.
[00:28:30.262 --> 00:28:40.346]  You are a disgrace to the human race, and I hope Obama puts you and your crew under the jail.
[00:28:40.346 --> 00:28:44.088]  And they say this in two newscasts I have.
[00:28:44.088 --> 00:28:49.490]  In another newscast that was on a Florida station, I can't find it now, it's off their main page.
[00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.351]  They say it's the most horrible thing they've ever seen and we need to be arrested.
[00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:59.554]  And then it shows him ripping off telephone poles, saying the police are investigating who put it on telephone poles.
[00:28:59.554 --> 00:29:04.277]  So now, if you've got a sign, I mean, I expect uniform enforcement here.
[00:29:04.277 --> 00:29:17.588]  You got a sign saying, come to our garage sale, or I'm looking for a white cat with black spots, or I'm looking for a brown dog with white spots, or whatever, or I'm looking for a Siamese cat, arrest them folks, they're criminals.
[00:29:17.588 --> 00:29:23.893]  You put a yard sign up, or you put a sign up over a rock and roll poster, it's over for you.
[00:29:25.967 --> 00:29:27.968]  And you want to see the comments on these TV stations.
[00:29:27.968 --> 00:29:32.152]  Now, 9 out of 10 are saying, hey, people put these signs up of Bush.
[00:29:32.152 --> 00:29:34.133]  I'm a Democrat, but this is hypocritical.
[00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:38.656]  But 10% are saying, arrest this Alex Jones right now!
[00:29:38.656 --> 00:29:39.497]  Arrest him!
[00:29:39.497 --> 00:29:41.579]  And it's all over the Drugs Report.
[00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:46.042]  And this feeds in to what we're going to cover when we get back.
[00:29:46.042 --> 00:29:48.664]  They're getting ready to carry out a new Oklahoma City.
[00:29:48.664 --> 00:29:51.146]  I see them doing it.
[00:29:51.146 --> 00:29:52.527]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.527 --> 00:29:54.048]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.041 --> 00:30:00.822]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.822 --> 00:30:03.823]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.823 --> 00:30:09.164]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.164 --> 00:30:11.205]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.205 --> 00:30:16.206]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.206 --> 00:30:17.126]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.386 --> 00:30:18.507]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.507 --> 00:30:20.389]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:21.469]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.469 --> 00:30:23.671]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.671 --> 00:30:25.012]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.012 --> 00:30:26.534]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:31.818]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.818 --> 00:30:35.401]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.401 --> 00:30:38.864]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:40.425]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.425 --> 00:30:41.326]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.326 --> 00:30:42.447]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.447 --> 00:30:43.368]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.368 --> 00:30:44.469]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.469 --> 00:30:47.511]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.511 --> 00:30:49.293]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.293 --> 00:30:50.213]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:07.392]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.392 --> 00:31:14.975]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:31:14.975 --> 00:31:21.137]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.557 --> 00:31:23.539]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.539 --> 00:31:26.041]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:26.041 --> 00:31:37.631]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:39.292]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.292 --> 00:31:41.154]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:41.154 --> 00:31:47.419]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:56.315]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.315 --> 00:31:57.896]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.896 --> 00:32:00.958]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.958 --> 00:32:05.561]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:08.122]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[00:32:08.122 --> 00:32:16.027]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day,
[00:32:16.227 --> 00:32:17.788]  There is no job security.
[00:32:17.788 --> 00:32:23.993]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[00:32:23.993 --> 00:32:26.694]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:36.822]  So, MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:45.748]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive
[00:32:45.828 --> 00:32:46.448]  We're good to go.
[00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:14.363]  I got Steve Quayle coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:14.363 --> 00:33:19.065]  He was already set up for the show today.
[00:33:19.065 --> 00:33:20.506]  But that's perfect.
[00:33:20.506 --> 00:33:24.407]  Because the Southern Poverty Law Center is savaging me and I as basically Nazis.
[00:33:24.407 --> 00:33:29.689]  Doesn't matter if Steve really gets criticized for being a big supporter of Israel.
[00:33:29.689 --> 00:33:34.091]  These people don't care.
[00:33:34.091 --> 00:33:35.252]  It's unbelievable.
[00:33:35.252 --> 00:33:36.132]  Keep lying.
[00:33:36.132 --> 00:33:38.453]  Keep sending me all the listeners.
[00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:43.711]  Call me any lies you want.
[00:33:43.711 --> 00:33:45.573]  I love it.
[00:33:45.573 --> 00:33:46.954]  Make it up.
[00:33:46.954 --> 00:33:48.115]  Say I'm a reptoid.
[00:33:48.115 --> 00:33:49.355]  Say I'm a Vatican assassin.
[00:33:49.355 --> 00:33:51.937]  Say I'm a Mossad agent.
[00:33:51.937 --> 00:33:53.618]  Say I'm a Nazi.
[00:33:53.618 --> 00:33:54.339]  Say it all.
[00:33:54.339 --> 00:34:04.186]  Because people are going to come to this radio show and the websites Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and they're going to find out the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:04.186 --> 00:34:06.768]  And they're going to find out that you're a liar.
[00:34:06.768 --> 00:34:09.310]  Now, the Southern Poverty Law Center gives the orders in America.
[00:34:10.968 --> 00:34:12.930]  And even more so in the ADL, I found.
[00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:23.239]  It was Southern Poverty Law Center that ran and set up the Elohim City white supremacist compound that came out in FBI documents released under FOIA request.
[00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.561]  In one document, they blacked out one area.
[00:34:25.561 --> 00:34:28.724]  Then in another lawsuit that a judge ordered released, they blocked out the other.
[00:34:29.685 --> 00:34:39.396]  And then the Associated Press and the two major papers in Salt Lake City superimposed it and got the whole memo.
[00:34:39.396 --> 00:34:40.497]  Oops!
[00:34:40.497 --> 00:34:45.042]  Southern Poverty Law Center running the op with Tim McVeigh.
[00:34:46.582 --> 00:34:48.763]  Running the facility he came out of.
[00:34:48.763 --> 00:35:00.646]  And we have the sworn deposition of Larry Nichols, that McVeigh was a black ops operator in Special Forces, there to set up militias in the Patriot movement and was set up at the end.
[00:35:00.646 --> 00:35:11.649]  Then of course, heavily drugged, Jolly and West in the MKUltra hearings in 77, was then his doctor from the time he was arrested through his trial in Denver to his execution in Terre Houte, Indiana.
[00:35:11.649 --> 00:35:12.769]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:35:14.625 --> 00:35:15.245]  It's like the L.A.
[00:35:15.245 --> 00:35:20.568]  Times reports Theodore Kaczynski was in the secret MKUltra mind control program, the Unabomber.
[00:35:20.568 --> 00:35:21.908]  You can't make that up!
[00:35:21.908 --> 00:35:22.929]  Who could make that up?
[00:35:22.929 --> 00:35:23.649]  That's L.A.
[00:35:23.649 --> 00:35:24.449]  Times.
[00:35:24.449 --> 00:35:27.271]  Truth is far weirder than fiction.
[00:35:27.271 --> 00:35:34.294]  And that's why if you're in special ops and they got you following patriots around and they're telling you you're gonna deliver a bomb here and you're gonna do that.
[00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:38.180]  There's a good chance they're going to blow it up and send you to prison for it.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.122]  They're going to grab you and keep you drugged up for five, six years, then execute you.
[00:35:42.122 --> 00:35:46.224]  Don't take part in any of these drills as a decoy.
[00:35:46.224 --> 00:35:47.885]  Same thing in 7-7.
[00:35:47.885 --> 00:35:48.966]  They hire these guys.
[00:35:48.966 --> 00:35:51.207]  We know they hired them to take part in drills.
[00:35:51.207 --> 00:35:53.528]  They put them on board those things and they got real bombs.
[00:35:55.222 --> 00:36:01.727]  A few of them figured it out, ditched the bombs, got chased down in broad daylight, and gunned down right out Piccadilly Circus.
[00:36:01.727 --> 00:36:02.627]  That was on the news.
[00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:07.230]  I mean, they'll chase you down and kill you if you don't carry out the bombing.
[00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:10.172]  This is how Black Op works.
[00:36:10.172 --> 00:36:12.074]  Best movie I've seen to describe it is, uh...
[00:36:13.115 --> 00:36:13.896]  Eagle Eye.
[00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:17.399]  People kept telling me for the last few years, watch that movie, watch it.
[00:36:17.399 --> 00:36:24.064]  And in that, you've got a computer at NSA and the Pentagon manipulating people, but it's not how it works.
[00:36:24.064 --> 00:36:27.007]  It's people doing it, but they also use computers.
[00:36:27.007 --> 00:36:29.549]  And you want to see a movie of how they operate, that's it.
[00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:36.356]  A lot of times they'll do a tight personality on somebody, they're controlled, they're focused, they're professional.
[00:36:36.356 --> 00:36:41.583]  They'll kill one of your kids and they'll call up and go, your 16-year-old Bobby just died in that car wreck last week.
[00:36:41.583 --> 00:36:43.045]  That wasn't an accident.
[00:36:43.045 --> 00:36:47.691]  Now your daughter Jenny, the 9-year-old's gonna die if you don't do exactly what I say.
[00:36:47.691 --> 00:36:48.532]  Do you understand?
[00:36:52.506 --> 00:36:56.887]  Now, they know a lot of people will just shut down, freak out, go crazy, call the police.
[00:36:56.887 --> 00:36:58.267]  But they typecast.
[00:36:58.267 --> 00:37:00.968]  They know who... I tell you, these people are smart!
[00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:03.989]  They're psych warfare, black ops experts.
[00:37:03.989 --> 00:37:06.629]  They have 180 IQs, the people running this.
[00:37:06.629 --> 00:37:07.330]  But they're evil.
[00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:08.150]  They're twisted.
[00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.990]  They're twisted geniuses.
[00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:16.332]  And it's going to take intelligent people that love light and liberty to rise up and crush them and expose their game.
[00:37:16.332 --> 00:37:20.913]  Now, the Southern Poverty Law Center, when
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.383]  Poplowski gunned down those three cops.
[00:37:24.383 --> 00:37:26.106]  Gets home at 2.30 drunk.
[00:37:26.106 --> 00:37:28.149]  Mommy wakes him up at 7 a.m.
[00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:29.991]  His dogs are urinating everywhere.
[00:37:29.991 --> 00:37:31.593]  He's a pit bull collector.
[00:37:31.593 --> 00:37:32.835]  They're crapping all over the floor.
[00:37:32.835 --> 00:37:34.197]  He throws a fit.
[00:37:34.197 --> 00:37:35.018]  The cops get there.
[00:37:35.018 --> 00:37:36.941]  He kills one, throws a fit, kills two more.
[00:37:38.342 --> 00:37:41.863]  Turns out he's a white supremacist attacking me all over the internet.
[00:37:41.863 --> 00:37:55.426]  Southern Poverty Law Center has the computers within two hours of him in custody, feeds their spokesman who writes these reports about the militias and people, feeds their reporter saying he was a fan and that I influenced it.
[00:37:55.426 --> 00:37:56.486]  Turned out it was the opposite.
[00:37:56.486 --> 00:37:58.567]  We did keyword searches, proved that they had to retract.
[00:37:59.187 --> 00:38:02.528]  The first person they're after is me!
[00:38:02.528 --> 00:38:07.270]  Now what does that tell you when the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL are after me?
[00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:12.071]  Because they know my message and the information we're covering is devastating to them.
[00:38:12.071 --> 00:38:16.232]  Because we're shattering the left-right paradigm, creating unity.
[00:38:16.232 --> 00:38:21.034]  Now, unity against the bankers, not unity under their agenda, which is the false unity they want.
[00:38:23.103 --> 00:38:39.953]  Now ladies and gentlemen, I need your prayers now more than ever because I told you they're going to pull another Oklahoma City and I told you you're going to start seeing militia and patriot demonization and mixing it in with white supremacists that are run by the feds in every case I've ever seen.
[00:38:39.953 --> 00:38:41.014]  It doesn't exist.
[00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:47.196]  Except in a few small cells of guys that drink beer in their garage and play pool.
[00:38:47.196 --> 00:38:50.260]  It doesn't exist outside of federal operations.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.341]  In every case.
[00:38:51.341 --> 00:38:52.262]  And we have hundreds.
[00:38:52.262 --> 00:38:52.963]  Confirmed.
[00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:55.886]  We've written articles with 30, 40, 50 links in some cases.
[00:38:55.886 --> 00:38:59.230]  We'll repost those today.
[00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.293]  They are now taking the Obama posters
[00:39:08.267 --> 00:39:17.209]  and putting death to Marxist and swastikas and things on it with the same image that somebody put out saying socialist we expanded it saying fascist we've got to make it
[00:39:18.115 --> 00:39:21.217]  Non-political or cover both left and right.
[00:39:21.217 --> 00:39:22.958]  Fascist does that.
[00:39:22.958 --> 00:39:26.441]  See, there I am trying to unify, not let them balkanize.
[00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:31.404]  And then now they're going to try to, and I'm getting the hate mail that I'm supposedly sending the swastikas out.
[00:39:31.404 --> 00:39:34.226]  Folks, this means we're hitting the enemy right in the heart.
[00:39:34.226 --> 00:39:38.609]  When you go in against the Death Star, they are going to fire at you with their big guns, okay?
[00:39:39.329 --> 00:39:40.510]  And that's what we're doing right now.
[00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.531]  We are taking the flak.
[00:39:41.531 --> 00:39:44.034]  And so the COINTELPRO is coming out of the woodwork.
[00:39:44.034 --> 00:39:46.616]  We're going to be attacked like never before.
[00:39:46.616 --> 00:39:48.038]  But that is the blessing.
[00:39:48.038 --> 00:39:51.961]  That means we're doing our job.
[00:39:51.961 --> 00:39:55.905]  And all these news clips are coming up in the next hour.
[00:39:55.905 --> 00:39:57.827]  Steve Quayle is also demonized.
[00:39:57.827 --> 00:40:01.651]  This is the big Southern Poverty Law Center report.
[00:40:01.651 --> 00:40:02.592]  And who do they come after?
[00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:06.747]  Who are they worried about?
[00:40:06.747 --> 00:40:17.672]  They're worried about former Campaign for Liberty, high-level person, military veteran, Special Forces officer, Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, because he's real.
[00:40:17.672 --> 00:40:21.954]  I've sent people to the meetings, we've met with them, these guys are real.
[00:40:21.954 --> 00:40:22.334]  It's real.
[00:40:23.476 --> 00:40:25.757]  They're professional, they're serious, they're focused.
[00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:34.240]  The establishment is scared to death that we're going to reach out to the military and police and wake them up just to follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:47.365]  In April, Oath Keepers founder Stuart Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate, they really don't like that, and former ADS representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican, let's get Rhodes on tomorrow, and a hardline libertarian, hardline, ooh.
[00:40:50.202 --> 00:40:52.584]  Worried about coming dictatorship.
[00:40:52.584 --> 00:40:56.487]  We know that if the day should come where a full-blown dictatorship would come.
[00:40:56.487 --> 00:40:58.809]  They did this, by the way, under Bush.
[00:40:58.809 --> 00:41:02.011]  See, because they can read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:41:02.011 --> 00:41:10.117]  They can read the NORTHCOM announcements and the DHS reports we broke saying veterans and gun owners is what Homeland Security's for.
[00:41:10.117 --> 00:41:13.880]  This government is rogue and criminal.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.142]  It's outlandishly openly tyrannical.
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:18.941]  And so, who does this report go after?
[00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:20.762]  It goes after the real people.
[00:41:20.762 --> 00:41:28.847]  Ron Paul, Oath Keepers, myself, Steve Coyle.
[00:41:28.847 --> 00:41:36.311]  A Yale Law School graduate and former ADO's representative, Ron Paul, a Texas Republican with hardline libertarian, worried about a coming dictatorship.
[00:41:36.311 --> 00:41:38.392]  Yeah, because he can read the Army's own announcements.
[00:41:38.392 --> 00:41:42.755]  I mean, governors say, stop running illegal checkpoints and the Army says, shut up!
[00:41:42.755 --> 00:41:43.415]  In Tennessee.
[00:41:43.415 --> 00:41:45.937]  I mean, this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:47.935 --> 00:41:59.823]  We know that if the day should come where a full-blown dictatorship would come, or tyranny, it can only happen if those men, our brothers in arms, go along and comply with the unconstitutional, unlawful orders.
[00:41:59.823 --> 00:42:02.264]  Rhodes told conspiracy-minded radio host Alex Jones.
[00:42:02.264 --> 00:42:04.205]  See, I got these creepy people.
[00:42:04.205 --> 00:42:05.766]  I mean, these are creepy folks, folks.
[00:42:05.766 --> 00:42:07.627]  These are hardcore people.
[00:42:07.627 --> 00:42:08.608]  Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:42:08.608 --> 00:42:10.149]  I mean, they mean business.
[00:42:10.149 --> 00:42:13.531]  And federal officers should know they mean business.
[00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:14.532]  These are your little friends.
[00:42:17.699 --> 00:42:21.041]  Then go read that federal document who was running McVeigh.
[00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:25.903]  These guys don't play games.
[00:42:25.903 --> 00:42:33.267]  Rhodes told Conspiracy Miner radio host Alex Jones, imagine if we focus on the police and military game over for the New World Order.
[00:42:33.267 --> 00:42:34.948]  I got a couple of these Southern Poverty Law ones.
[00:42:34.948 --> 00:42:40.170]  Where's the one with Steve in it?
[00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:41.191]  I got so many of these articles.
[00:42:41.191 --> 00:42:43.672]  I got them stacked up here in front of me.
[00:42:43.672 --> 00:42:45.033]  Or is that in that CNN report?
[00:42:48.146 --> 00:43:04.261]  Alex Jones, the radio host and conspiracy theorist, got wind of the plans and intervened and interviewed a National Guard official setting off an avalanche of angry calls and visits to his website from people who feared the exercise was really about imposing a dictatorship or martial law on the country.
[00:43:04.261 --> 00:43:11.788]  Tell them that any violation of your rights will result in live fire exercise, one such person wrote on Jones Infowars website.
[00:43:11.788 --> 00:43:12.789]  See, that's a comment!
[00:43:14.346 --> 00:43:19.489]  They love those comments, because they can't get me saying anything, so they use the comments.
[00:43:19.489 --> 00:43:22.832]  If they come, come loaded for war.
[00:43:22.832 --> 00:43:27.695]  Now remember, it was in the Iowa newspaper, they were going to do door-to-door gun confiscation drill.
[00:43:27.695 --> 00:43:29.776]  It said, a drill going after guns.
[00:43:29.776 --> 00:43:31.897]  And they were going to lock the city down with checkpoints.
[00:43:31.897 --> 00:43:32.618]  The town.
[00:43:32.618 --> 00:43:36.761]  The tiny town of 700, or whatever it was.
[00:43:36.761 --> 00:43:38.402]  Arcadia.
[00:43:38.402 --> 00:43:40.123]  But see, the way they write this, it's like,
[00:43:45.046 --> 00:43:50.308]  Knowing how bad the internet is and how we mobilize and all this.
[00:43:50.308 --> 00:43:52.989]  So this is all going on.
[00:43:52.989 --> 00:43:54.370]  I want to bring up Paul Watson now.
[00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:55.771]  He just wrote a big article on this.
[00:43:55.771 --> 00:43:57.912]  We need to get out to everybody.
[00:43:57.912 --> 00:44:04.114]  They don't just in these newscasts, Paul, say the one person in the country that put one on a mailbox and give me a break.
[00:44:04.114 --> 00:44:07.136]  You see people doing that all the time, but it's still not a good thing.
[00:44:07.136 --> 00:44:08.476]  We've told people not to do that.
[00:44:08.476 --> 00:44:12.058]  We said do it in high traffic areas, poles, where people hang signs.
[00:44:13.086 --> 00:44:13.526]  That's right, Alex.
[00:44:13.526 --> 00:44:15.247]  I mean, I've been tracking this for a week.
[00:44:15.247 --> 00:44:16.647]  You announced the contest around a week ago.
[00:44:16.647 --> 00:44:16.968]  And for a week.
[00:44:16.968 --> 00:44:18.328]  I mean, go and search YouTube.
[00:44:18.328 --> 00:44:18.968]  There's hundreds of
[00:44:38.306 --> 00:44:47.769]  Places where people have put up these posters on light poles, on telephone poles, on trees, on the roadside, places like that.
[00:44:47.769 --> 00:44:53.010]  And the media didn't touch it for a week, even though these posters are everywhere.
[00:44:53.010 --> 00:45:05.314]  And so as soon as somebody puts two posters on a mailbox, it's this big shock horror, this feigned aghast reaction at the fact that this is vandalism.
[00:45:06.005 --> 00:45:20.674]  And now they're implying in these two news reports, this Florida news station, which we've got linked up there on PrisonPlanet.com, they're implying that it's basically vandalism and a criminal offense to put up flyers anywhere.
[00:45:20.674 --> 00:45:23.636]  That's the impression that they give.
[00:45:23.636 --> 00:45:32.081]  Yeah, I mean, the reporter shows a lady pulling down on a power pole, or off a light pole, and says, uh, says, uh, the police are investigating this vandalism.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.282]  Yeah, and of course, they don't care about vandalism.
[00:45:36.282 --> 00:45:37.843]  It's got nothing to do with vandalism.
[00:45:37.843 --> 00:45:48.390]  It's about chilling freedom of speech and intimidating political activists from going out and actually exercising their First Amendment rights.
[00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:52.192]  Now, to them, what people are doing is putting up these flyers.
[00:45:52.192 --> 00:45:58.076]  I mean, the Pentagon have told us what it is, what they classify as low-level terrorism.
[00:45:58.076 --> 00:46:02.459]  That's what they announced in June, that there was a Pentagon test and one of the answers was
[00:46:03.351 --> 00:46:07.454]  You know, which of the following equates to low-level terrorism?
[00:46:07.454 --> 00:46:14.840]  The options were attacking the Pentagon, IEDs, hate crimes against racial groups, and protests.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.463]  And the correct answer on the exam was protests.
[00:46:18.463 --> 00:46:26.950]  So, to the authorities, putting up flyers of Obama as the Joker, which people did of Bush years ago, the same thing.
[00:46:28.143 --> 00:46:31.847]  Well, the national media, scores of times a week and a half ago,
[00:46:46.715 --> 00:46:52.317]  Took screenshots off the Drudge Report of the original Obama posters in Los Angeles.
[00:46:52.317 --> 00:46:57.599]  Now, he craftily last night and today, people can go look at it right now, get a screenshot, Paul.
[00:46:57.599 --> 00:46:59.460]  I don't know if you've already done that.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:11.805]  They posted our posters, and called it vandalism, over the swastika on the congressman's, and I think we should check the congressman's hands for paint.
[00:47:11.805 --> 00:47:13.886]  You know, the poor victim.
[00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:17.085]  But, or some idiot kid did this.
[00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:23.666]  The point is, is that they are clearly trying to imply that putting up the posters is Nazi.
[00:47:23.666 --> 00:47:37.569]  I mean, that's what the Drudge Report is doing, and I guarantee you, the National News is already reporting on this, but I guarantee you, if it hadn't already happened, they are going to show a screenshot off the news of our posters with that swastika under it from a separate news report.
[00:47:37.569 --> 00:47:38.869]  I mean, this is how they work.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.650]  Because I'm getting emails hoarding in saying, how dare you white supremacists do this?
[00:47:45.126 --> 00:47:49.387]  And so, it's certainly working, isn't it, Paul?
[00:47:49.387 --> 00:48:09.911]  That's right, and I mean, the fact that, you know, they picked it up as soon as it went on the mailbox proves that they were waiting just to exploit that one example and put out this calculated editorial spin that's aimed at demonizing people who question Obama's anointed, saintly image.
[00:48:09.911 --> 00:48:12.471]  Because if the people they interview in the news piece
[00:48:13.177 --> 00:48:22.401]  You know, express their shock that disrespecting the President when his poll numbers, his popular approval, is sinking faster than Bush.
[00:48:22.401 --> 00:48:31.745]  In the real world, nobody's falling for it anymore, but they need to uphold this angelic, saintly image of Obama to get his failing agenda back on track.
[00:48:32.443 --> 00:48:56.145]  Which is why they're now coming out with yet more reports saying that the militia and patriots are going to be thinking about violence and linking the militia movement with a portent of violence in the coming months when, as you discussed earlier, the only examples of violence being linked to the militia or patriot movement
[00:48:56.815 --> 00:49:09.338]  were when the government used acts of domestic terror to frame the militia movement or the patriot movement as patsies, or indeed the patriot movement and the militia were the victims.
[00:49:09.338 --> 00:49:19.220]  You know, it was the BATF that killed 76 people in 1993 when they burned down the Branch Davidian Ranch, killed 20 children and two pregnant women.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:25.081]  It was the FBI snipers that killed Randy Weaver's wife as she was holding a 10-month baby.
[00:49:25.822 --> 00:49:37.309]  They're the ones engaged in the violence and the only time militia or patriot comes into it is when they're the victims or they're being framed for it.
[00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:39.351]  Paul, I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:44.094]  I just want listeners to understand we really know what we're talking about.
[00:49:44.094 --> 00:49:55.021]  I've been saying the last two weeks and throughout the weekend in the last two days they're going to come out and say that anybody that's against open borders, gun control,
[00:49:56.590 --> 00:50:07.578]  Anybody who is against cap-and-trade taxes, carbon taxes, anybody who's against government-run health care, is a white supremacist murdering bomber.
[00:50:07.578 --> 00:50:18.305]  This morning, watching CNN and MSNBC, they had the Southern Poverty Law Center on, saying that the militias are going to attack and kill us.
[00:50:18.305 --> 00:50:20.667]  And notice, this was already put out by the DHS report,
[00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:23.793]  Five, six months ago.
[00:50:23.793 --> 00:50:32.376]  So they are pre-scripting all of this, and I've been saying all week, they have got to stage terror attacks now, or their agenda's dead.
[00:50:32.376 --> 00:50:35.878]  And so I've been telling people, get ready for this.
[00:50:35.878 --> 00:50:44.501]  We're now seeing the preparatory phase as they prep the public that this is going to happen.
[00:50:44.501 --> 00:50:47.102]  And so get ready.
[00:50:47.102 --> 00:50:50.784]  We've gotta get the word out now, like I did two months before 9-11.
[00:50:52.452 --> 00:50:55.155]  That they are getting ready to stage something.
[00:50:55.155 --> 00:50:58.177]  I'm sorry to the feds that your bosses are going to bomb you.
[00:50:58.177 --> 00:51:00.840]  We're trying to stop it.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:07.546]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[00:51:07.546 --> 00:51:09.208]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[00:51:09.208 --> 00:51:13.792]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[00:51:13.792 --> 00:51:15.554]  But because this is not a cigarette,
[00:51:15.794 --> 00:51:21.456]  You don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[00:51:21.456 --> 00:51:26.338]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire, and has no dangerous second-hand smoke.
[00:51:26.338 --> 00:51:32.340]  So it's safe for the people around you and will save you right around 50% over smoking regular cigarettes.

[00:52:01.423 --> 00:52:07.469]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.469 --> 00:52:13.335]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:52:13.335 --> 00:52:19.521]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:21.804]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:21.804 --> 00:52:24.267]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:52:24.267 --> 00:52:35.201]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:52:37.449 --> 00:52:39.130]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:40.992]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:40.992 --> 00:52:47.897]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.897 --> 00:52:56.164]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.164 --> 00:52:57.745]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.745 --> 00:52:58.926]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.768 --> 00:53:07.993]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[00:53:07.993 --> 00:53:11.936]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[00:53:11.936 --> 00:53:20.263]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:23.165]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[00:53:23.165 --> 00:53:25.647]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[00:53:25.947 --> 00:53:26.167]  Yeah.
[00:53:56.547 --> 00:53:59.790]  Oh, I hear the train a-comin'!
[00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:24.967]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin' on But that train keeps a-rollin'
[00:54:25.982 --> 00:54:38.004]  Paul Watson, you've been with me now for, I don't know, seven years?
[00:54:38.004 --> 00:54:39.884]  Since you were 20.
[00:54:39.884 --> 00:54:43.425]  And your brother, for almost as long.
[00:54:58.613 --> 00:55:06.459]  And the websites now, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, are the first and second largest alternative sites.
[00:55:06.459 --> 00:55:11.824]  Does it creep you out to have the Southern Poverty Law Center in every case come after us first?
[00:55:11.824 --> 00:55:13.305]  I mean, that's got to let us know.
[00:55:13.305 --> 00:55:19.510]  We are really making them mad whenever we talk about Oklahoma City.
[00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:26.956]  It seems to be the case that increasingly we're being pushed to the forefront of this demonization campaign, which is to be expected because
[00:55:27.642 --> 00:55:34.403]  You know, we're the biggest thing out there in terms of internet presence, certainly in this movement.
[00:55:34.403 --> 00:55:56.108]  But the big breaking news on this, which demolishes the entire foundation of the DHS, the Southern Poverty Law Center's claims, is a Freedom of Information Act request was made by Americans for Limited Government to find out what the basis of the now infamous
[00:55:56.772 --> 00:56:06.435]  The report on right-wing extremism was the report that was put out by the Department of Homeland Security under Obama, of course.
[00:56:06.435 --> 00:56:22.940]  And this was also referenced in the Associated Press report today, which talked about this new Southern Poverty Law Center warning about the growth of the militia movement and potential violence, and also linking it with gun owners and then smearing them as
[00:56:23.601 --> 00:56:29.025]  You know, being involved with people like Richard Poplowski, the Pittsburgh cop killer.
[00:56:29.025 --> 00:56:47.977]  It turns out that the main source of the DHS report on right-wing extremism, the main source from which they garnered the material to write the report, was a website which infamously announced
[00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:56.582]  The vast majority of our readers and the people on the forum will know how ridiculous and kooky this website is.
[00:56:56.582 --> 00:57:02.125]  It infamously puts out disinformation on a daily basis.
[00:57:02.125 --> 00:57:06.307]  I'm not going to give the name out, just to avoid them getting any traffic.
[00:57:06.307 --> 00:57:18.293]  But this website, amongst its other bizarre claims, one is that the government of the United States, via sophisticated radio waves, has been in direct contact with extraterrestrial aliens,
[00:57:18.996 --> 00:57:27.078]  And that the United States, through their scientists, destroyed a communication device that the Russians have got with these aliens.
[00:57:27.078 --> 00:57:29.639]  That's one of their main claims at the moment.
[00:57:29.639 --> 00:57:37.581]  And this website was the main source for DHS's report on right-wing extremism.
[00:57:37.581 --> 00:57:47.624]  Some of their links, they've got a PDF file, which was used by the DHS, of their sources for this right-wing extremism report.
[00:57:48.635 --> 00:58:08.372]  Several of the links of ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center, so it's just an echo chamber basically, and then no less than 11 of the links on which they base their entire report are from this kooky, inane website that claims that the US and the Russians are fighting a war over communication with aliens.
[00:58:09.161 --> 00:58:14.403]  So the entire foundation of their report is based on this bizarre, kooky website that's got no credibility at all.
[00:58:29.414 --> 00:58:32.680]  We are under sustained new world order attack by the government, the white supremacist, everybody right now.
[00:58:40.854 --> 00:58:46.459]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.459 --> 00:58:50.283]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.283 --> 00:58:55.587]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.587 --> 00:59:00.111]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:59:00.111 --> 00:59:02.393]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:02.393 --> 00:59:04.015]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:04.015 --> 00:59:05.056]  There is a solution.
[00:59:05.276 --> 00:59:13.701]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:06.485]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.485 --> 01:00:08.266]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.266 --> 01:00:10.006]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:11.606]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.606 --> 01:00:13.167]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.167 --> 01:00:17.328]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.328 --> 01:00:21.409]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.988 --> 01:00:37.796]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I got the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, the national media, all attacking me.
[01:00:37.796 --> 01:00:41.578]  They've gone and gotten armed.
[01:00:41.578 --> 01:00:49.843]  Images of Obama as a fascist, and they posted it on the Drudge Report right next to a swastika being painted on a congressman's
[01:00:52.609 --> 01:01:17.359]  uh... sign outside his local offices and they admit it's two separate stories but they put them right next to each other knowing the idiot public will think I did this and so I'm getting death threats right now from just well-meaning morons who think I'm a white supremacist and it's just it's just unbelievable this country I mean the way they manipulate the public
[01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:21.857]  Because I know the public doesn't even read articles, they just go off headlines.
[01:01:21.857 --> 01:01:25.379]  So a headline will say one thing, and then the article says another.
[01:01:25.379 --> 01:01:34.163]  They're really upset about the listeners of this show putting the ObamaInfoWars.com posters up in Commons areas and on power poles.
[01:01:34.163 --> 01:01:36.384]  It's totally legal and lawful.
[01:01:36.384 --> 01:01:40.065]  There might be a few towns where it's a misdemeanor or something, so be sure and follow your local rules.
[01:01:40.065 --> 01:01:45.468]  But everybody puts up lost cat, lost dog, yard sale stuff.
[01:01:46.778 --> 01:01:49.859]  Especially political speech is protected.
[01:01:49.859 --> 01:01:57.241]  And they're on the news, we've got the clips, the news clips saying it should be illegal, I should be arrested, it's bad.
[01:01:57.241 --> 01:02:00.782]  Paul Watson in closing, they are really coming after us right now.
[01:02:00.782 --> 01:02:10.125]  I mean, I know you've been listening the last few weeks as I've been seeing all the pieces and saying they've got to come back with that mid-1990s demonization of militias and gun owners.
[01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:14.566]  And they did this in the three months before the feds bombed OKC, bombed themselves.
[01:02:17.307 --> 01:02:31.353]  I just asked the feds and police, when your bosses kill you, minutes after the blast, remember who you saw, follow people, do the investigation, you'll be able to catch other compartments of the federal government or private mercs doing it.
[01:02:31.353 --> 01:02:36.395]  It's now come out that major mercenary arms were shipping arms in to the mercenaries.
[01:02:36.395 --> 01:02:38.096]  That's coming out in federal court.
[01:02:38.096 --> 01:02:41.237]  We told you they're blowing up the mosque and shooting our own troops.
[01:02:41.237 --> 01:02:43.358]  They will kill you!
[01:02:43.358 --> 01:02:45.959]  This is a multi-trillion dollar business, this police state.
[01:02:46.559 --> 01:02:48.921]  And there is no real army or real enemy.
[01:02:48.921 --> 01:02:56.706]  So they will occasionally... I hope the police and military understand this, Paul.
[01:02:56.706 --> 01:03:15.340]  Yeah, the establishment is definitely salivating over the prospect that some nutcase, some, you know, 21st century marinist vandaluber, you know, similar to the guy who shot up the Holocaust Museum, is going to create some kind of incident that they can exploit to demonize everybody.
[01:03:16.132 --> 01:03:37.893]  And we know that this is now their directed agenda, based on the fact that this DHS report, which attacked gun owners, anti-abortion people, states' rights people, Ron Paul supporters, as domestic terrorists, you know, they call the alternative media domestic terrorists as well, was based on one guy doing two hours clicking around on the internet.
[01:03:37.893 --> 01:03:40.055]  Their main source is this Kook website.
[01:03:40.715 --> 01:03:55.972]  And that's the site that always says that there's trillions of dollars from some ambassador, that some woman from 9-11 was alive and arrested in Zurich, or that there's shootouts on the subway in Chicago.
[01:03:55.972 --> 01:03:58.215]  It's all definitely disinfo.
[01:03:59.306 --> 01:04:03.789]  Yeah, the DHS did no rudimentary research or investigation.
[01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:05.390]  They interviewed nobody.
[01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:08.151]  All they did was click around on some kook website.
[01:04:08.151 --> 01:04:09.232]  I don't think it's kook.
[01:04:09.232 --> 01:04:09.993]  I don't think it's kook.
[01:04:09.993 --> 01:04:11.593]  I think that's done on purpose.
[01:04:11.593 --> 01:04:18.137]  Then threw in some Southern Poverty Law Center link, some ADL link, and that's the foundation of their report.
[01:04:18.137 --> 01:04:19.738]  It's been completely discredited.
[01:04:19.738 --> 01:04:25.202]  Will they also go and find one semi-threatening thing on my website by a commenter?
[01:04:26.378 --> 01:04:29.820]  And they put it in there as if I said it.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.241]  I'm just going to have to sue the Southern Primary Law Center.
[01:04:32.241 --> 01:04:37.765]  I just don't have time to sue all these liars!
[01:04:37.765 --> 01:04:38.785]  I'm not a Nazi.
[01:04:38.785 --> 01:04:40.106]  I'm not a space alien.
[01:04:40.106 --> 01:04:42.947]  I don't work for the Vatican.
[01:04:42.947 --> 01:04:46.530]  I didn't see Jesus sacrificed in a hologram.
[01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:48.891]  I don't believe in flying submarines.
[01:04:48.891 --> 01:04:49.971]  Paul Watson, great job.
[01:04:49.971 --> 01:04:52.233]  Keep it up at PrisonPlanet.com, okay?
[01:04:52.233 --> 01:04:53.173]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:53.173 --> 01:04:53.634]  Thanks a lot.
[01:04:53.634 --> 01:04:54.234]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.384 --> 01:05:04.628]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:05:04.628 --> 01:05:06.630]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:15.159]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:05:15.159 --> 01:05:20.704]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:05:20.704 --> 01:05:22.326]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:05:22.566 --> 01:05:29.071]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:05:29.071 --> 01:05:40.139]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:05:40.139 --> 01:05:40.599]  That's right.
[01:05:40.879 --> 01:05:43.462]  Clean water right from the air you breathe.

[01:06:00.367 --> 01:06:01.747]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.747 --> 01:06:03.748]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:06:03.748 --> 01:06:04.728]  Well, you should.
[01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:09.230]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:10.030]  That's right.

[01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:27.380]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:34.287]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:06:34.287 --> 01:06:39.812]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:06:39.812 --> 01:06:41.273]  This is real.

[01:07:01.564 --> 01:07:03.745]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.

[01:07:10.867 --> 01:07:16.709]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anywhere.

[01:08:01.927 --> 01:08:04.590]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:10.074]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.074 --> 01:08:17.981]  We've got two hours and 52 minutes left of this live transmission.
[01:08:17.981 --> 01:08:26.489]  In about five minutes, Steve Quayle is joining us to cover the latest flu pandemic information and how that's being used as the pretext for takeover of the country.
[01:08:29.198 --> 01:08:40.222]  We'll be going over that.
[01:08:40.222 --> 01:08:47.704]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, the Associated Press, TV stations, they're all attacking me today.
[01:08:47.704 --> 01:08:55.366]  I told you the feds were gonna come out and say that militias work with white supremacists and they're gonna attack the government.
[01:08:56.539 --> 01:08:59.660]  And then, the Feds are gonna attack themselves.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:05.223]  Just like Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag to crack down on the public and arrest people instead of a police state.
[01:09:05.223 --> 01:09:13.187]  The Feds did the same scripting before they bombed themselves in 95, and that's been confirmed in FBI documents.
[01:09:13.187 --> 01:09:15.328]  Now there's sworn affidavits from Larry Nichols.
[01:09:17.082 --> 01:09:20.304]  They are definitely coming after us, okay?
[01:09:20.304 --> 01:09:25.007]  And every time the Southern Poverty Law Center opens their mouth now, it's me.
[01:09:25.007 --> 01:09:27.809]  I'm their number one target now.
[01:09:27.809 --> 01:09:31.512]  They are coming after me, Ron Paul, and Oath Keepers, but first Alex Jones.
[01:09:31.512 --> 01:09:32.092]  And you know why?
[01:09:32.092 --> 01:09:35.755]  Because I know what they're doing, I know their ball game, and it freaks them out.
[01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:45.945]  And when I keep pointing out to you that we know they're ballgame here at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, that's so people will pay attention to what we're saying and what we're doing.
[01:09:45.945 --> 01:09:48.808]  You see the big guns of the enemy going up against us.
[01:09:48.808 --> 01:09:51.150]  We are the challenge of the New World Order.
[01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:52.572]  I'm in God's hands.
[01:09:52.572 --> 01:09:58.238]  They don't want to kill me because that would underline everything I've said, everything I've done.
[01:09:59.636 --> 01:10:04.260]  Just like the Southern Poverty Law Center, page after page demonizing me, we've got it highlighted.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.520]  Let's zoom in on this.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:12.266]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers watching that aren't just listening on the radio, if they kill me, it'll underline my name.
[01:10:12.266 --> 01:10:18.610]  Just like we've highlighted it here in the Southern Poverty Law Center report.
[01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:24.595]  Because we know about the cancer viruses and the vaccine, and now we're pushing it out in the mainstream news with top scientists.
[01:10:27.972 --> 01:10:30.495]  We know how to defeat them.
[01:10:30.495 --> 01:10:32.757]  We understand their ballgame.
[01:10:32.757 --> 01:10:35.581]  We understand what they're doing.
[01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:38.884]  But that doesn't mean they still might not set me up or crush me.
[01:10:38.884 --> 01:10:40.106]  They're very bold.
[01:10:40.106 --> 01:10:42.128]  I'm not challenging the elite to kill me.
[01:10:42.128 --> 01:10:45.712]  I know you don't care.
[01:10:45.712 --> 01:10:47.494]  I'm just laying out the facts here.
[01:10:49.457 --> 01:10:53.659]  And for most people in the government, most people in life, this is not good for us.
[01:10:53.659 --> 01:10:55.740]  99% of us, this is not good for us.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:00.422]  It's less than 1% that this corruption is beneficial for.
[01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:15.950]  There's 6,000 super gophers, super managers, the elite, Rothkopf, head of the Kissinger Group, wrote a best-selling book last year, wrote articles for the Washington Post, world government, global carbon taxes, neo-feudalism, 6,000 elitists, working for less than 20 families.
[01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:17.530]  This is not my opinion.
[01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:18.291]  This is a fact.
[01:11:19.011 --> 01:11:23.393]  And all these years we warned people, and they laughed at us and said we were kooks.
[01:11:23.393 --> 01:11:24.894]  Now it's all come true.
[01:11:24.894 --> 01:11:27.775]  Our credibility's shooting up at all-time highs.
[01:11:27.775 --> 01:11:31.417]  And I knew this Joker poster situation.
[01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:43.063]  Well, when they said you're not allowed to, it's bad, it's racist to show Obama in a bad light, punch up my article that Paul Watson did where it shows Bush as the Joker, Bush as a vampire.
[01:11:43.063 --> 01:11:44.984]  The article's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:52.960]  It's exercising First Amendment, now vandalism as corporate media attacks Obama joker contest.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:12:01.747]  Florida news station attempts to chill free speech and initiate, intimidate political activists by claiming that putting up flyers is a criminal offense.
[01:12:01.747 --> 01:12:05.070]  And then we have the flyers and news, there it is with Bush.
[01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.732]  Bush is a vampire, Bush is a joker.
[01:12:07.732 --> 01:12:12.396]  The Village Voice itself said it's okay to show Bush as a vampire, but not Obama.
[01:12:14.192 --> 01:12:16.454]  By the way, we had a big copy of that Village Voice poster.
[01:12:16.454 --> 01:12:18.255]  We bought one from the Village Voice.
[01:12:18.255 --> 01:12:21.058]  Hanging up in our office, the old office.
[01:12:21.058 --> 01:12:23.079]  Got lost in the move or somewhere in a box.
[01:12:23.079 --> 01:12:27.523]  But, you know, we're against these puppets, these New World Order people.
[01:12:27.523 --> 01:12:29.725]  So we criticize Bush, we criticize Obama.
[01:12:29.725 --> 01:12:34.308]  I make a film, The Obama Deception, and expose him as a puppet.
[01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.010]  But he enjoys lying to people.
[01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:37.771]  He enjoys reading off those teleprompters.
[01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:39.112]  He does make me sick.
[01:12:39.112 --> 01:12:41.034]  But he's still just a puppet and I wish him no harm.
[01:12:42.486 --> 01:12:44.146]  The establishment knows this.
[01:12:44.146 --> 01:12:45.467]  Now, watch the newscast.
[01:12:45.467 --> 01:12:48.107]  Look at these women, the looks of concern.
[01:12:48.107 --> 01:12:49.948]  You know, they're talking about some gun owner getting arrested.
[01:12:49.948 --> 01:12:55.229]  They smile and say it's good, but if they're talking about the First Amendment, oh, it's so scary.
[01:12:55.229 --> 01:12:58.930]  And they finally got somebody somewhere to put one on a post office box.
[01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:00.811]  So they got to, oh, federal offense.
[01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:03.871]  And then color of law, blur the lines.
[01:13:03.871 --> 01:13:05.592]  They're experts at that and mix it in with
[01:13:06.332 --> 01:13:08.754]  Oh, and on PowerPolls, you'll get arrested.
[01:13:08.754 --> 01:13:13.538]  Don't do it anywhere, but in the same article we've got right here, look at that.
[01:13:13.538 --> 01:13:14.318]  Lost Cat.
[01:13:14.318 --> 01:13:17.160]  In fact, let's punch up the actual article if we can.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.281]  Lost Cat.
[01:13:18.281 --> 01:13:22.224]  Professional football franchises hiring.
[01:13:22.224 --> 01:13:23.545]  A yard sale.
[01:13:23.545 --> 01:13:24.626]  Are they going to arrest?
[01:13:24.626 --> 01:13:30.631]  Are they going to go to the yard sale and arrest them?
[01:13:30.631 --> 01:13:31.952]  See, this is ridiculous.
[01:13:33.143 --> 01:13:41.771]  So, hundreds of people all over the world, from Ireland to California, from Texas to Moscow are putting these up.
[01:13:41.771 --> 01:13:45.195]  And they're putting up Gordon Brown's and putting Infowars.com on it.
[01:13:45.195 --> 01:13:48.058]  And they're putting up Putin's and putting Infowars.com on it.
[01:13:48.058 --> 01:13:51.921]  They're putting up, I saw some Japanese version with Infowars.
[01:13:51.921 --> 01:13:54.043]  I can't, I don't even know who the guy is in the diet.
[01:13:54.844 --> 01:13:56.186]  The establishment is scared.
[01:13:56.186 --> 01:13:56.947]  So look at them.
[01:13:56.947 --> 01:13:58.088]  Oh, it's so scary.
[01:13:58.088 --> 01:14:04.717]  Doesn't matter that the Florida CPS has kidnapped tens of thousands of kids and admit three plus thousand are missing.
[01:14:04.717 --> 01:14:10.024]  Doesn't matter that Florida's totally corrupt and the government's collapsing and $23.7 trillion has been stolen.
[01:14:10.024 --> 01:14:12.307]  What matters is, is this Alex Jones.
[01:14:12.307 --> 01:14:12.747]  Here it is.
[01:14:14.292 --> 01:14:16.834]  Barack Obama, they're being hung all over the city of Claremont.
[01:14:16.834 --> 01:14:18.556]  Have many residents outraged?
[01:14:18.556 --> 01:14:25.182]  Yeah, that's because the posters look like this, and whoever is posting them is using anything from staples to glue to do it.
[01:14:25.182 --> 01:14:32.248]  I would assume this morning's Darlene Jones is live in Claremont, and Darlene, this is more than a political statement, it's vandalism.
[01:14:32.248 --> 01:14:33.029]  It is vandalism.
[01:14:33.029 --> 01:14:37.113]  You can see that someone had stapled the signs to this utility pole.
[01:14:37.113 --> 01:14:37.613]  Stop right there!
[01:14:37.613 --> 01:14:39.195]  The president's obviously upset about this.
[01:14:40.077 --> 01:14:47.666]  See what they did yesterday is they went and found one on a post office box.
[01:14:47.666 --> 01:14:52.572]  And then the next day, it's now power poles.
[01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:54.494]  And that pole is covered with nails.
[01:14:54.494 --> 01:14:56.637]  If you look on it, everybody puts them up.
[01:14:58.562 --> 01:15:04.666]  I bet everybody here has put a sign up for a garage sale, or a lost dog, or cat, or you find a dog.
[01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:10.729]  I mean, my wife always sees some dog wandering around, or some cat that's got a thing around its neck but no tag.
[01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:13.230]  She'll go around and put... Arrest her!
[01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:13.651]  It's over!
[01:15:13.651 --> 01:15:14.151]  Go into prison!
[01:15:15.526 --> 01:15:23.932]  So again, this is the chilling effect, but people are all on this local news site saying we saw stuff of Bush as the devil all over Florida, and who didn't see him?
[01:15:23.932 --> 01:15:25.453]  You know, you didn't care then.
[01:15:25.453 --> 01:15:28.675]  Again, the left is always worst about free speech.
[01:15:28.675 --> 01:15:30.396]  They love going after free speech.
[01:15:30.396 --> 01:15:30.756]  Here it is.
[01:15:34.986 --> 01:15:43.650]  The posters are on street signs, telephone poles, and someone was bold enough to put them up on mailboxes at the Claremont's post office, which is a federal crime.
[01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:51.634]  He looks so mean and gruesome and evil, and this is not something that you want to, as an American, to portray your president, no matter what you think.
[01:15:51.634 --> 01:15:53.495]  You know, that's very disrespectful.
[01:15:53.495 --> 01:15:57.577]  The signs depict President Barack Obama as the Joker or Clown.
[01:15:57.577 --> 01:16:01.939]  Residents have filed reports with the local police and called the city demanding they come down.
[01:16:02.039 --> 01:16:08.245]  I'd like to know who the person is making all this payment to tell you the truth so they can get at least part of the punishment.
[01:16:08.245 --> 01:16:13.790]  Known radio talk show host and internet personality Alex Jones is encouraging people to videotape themselves.
[01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:14.691]  It paused.
[01:16:14.691 --> 01:16:16.232]  Did you hear that?
[01:16:16.232 --> 01:16:20.656]  Notice they slowed it down where I was blinking my eyes, made me look like I'm retarded.
[01:16:20.656 --> 01:16:25.741]  They got every trick in the book going here where they slow it down right where I'm blinking.
[01:16:25.741 --> 01:16:27.983]  So it's like, Alex Jones,
[01:16:29.684 --> 01:16:33.106]  I mean, you guys are just... And then this guy says, I need to be arrested.
[01:16:33.106 --> 01:16:35.347]  The guy's saying, do this, he needs to be punished.
[01:16:35.347 --> 01:16:37.768]  This guy isn't even American, listen to him.
[01:16:37.768 --> 01:16:39.209]  I mean, why did you come to this country?
[01:16:39.209 --> 01:16:41.751]  Probably because you live in a police state somewhere, right?
[01:16:41.751 --> 01:16:43.492]  Where there's sewage running down the street?
[01:16:43.492 --> 01:16:45.153]  Hit pause on it.
[01:16:45.153 --> 01:16:49.235]  I mean, you know, I'm glad you're here, buddy, but, you know, don't try to destroy the Bill of Rights.
[01:16:49.235 --> 01:16:51.056]  It's the only thing protecting you.
[01:16:51.056 --> 01:16:58.500]  And this woman right here, she doesn't... I'm not gonna play it all, it's up on InfoWars, that we got three of them, and now there's national reports pouring in, and...
[01:17:00.339 --> 01:17:06.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, we do a contest, we say follow the laws, put them up where other posters are put up.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:11.501]  Power poles, light poles, downtown areas where people put up other posters.
[01:17:11.501 --> 01:17:21.783]  But see, they don't care if you put up your rock band or your church or your lost cat or your yard sale or your hiring ad or, you know, that there's a hamburger place down the street.
[01:17:21.783 --> 01:17:25.844]  They only care about political messages.
[01:17:26.644 --> 01:17:29.245]  And it's so mean, you're not allowed to show him bad.
[01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:32.706]  Now that's just our total American history and our spirit.
[01:17:32.706 --> 01:17:40.669]  So now somebody's faxing a man with swastikas on him, and I guarantee you, that's somebody connected to the Southern Poverty Law Center or some group like that.
[01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:42.750]  I mean, they've been caught over and over again.
[01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:43.730]  Let's go to Steve Quayle.
[01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:47.592]  Steve, I got you on about the flu last week, but the whole police state and what's happening.
[01:17:48.703 --> 01:17:55.428]  I've got all these news reports demonizing myself, you, Ron Paul, countless other people.
[01:17:55.428 --> 01:17:57.770]  They are really getting scared right now.
[01:17:57.770 --> 01:18:10.481]  Meanwhile, major German publications, German TV, German radio, and Bild.de, one of their biggest, most prestigious magazines, about cancer viruses in the vaccine, top researchers.
[01:18:10.481 --> 01:18:12.062]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.344]  They are really concerned about us, Steve.
[01:18:14.892 --> 01:18:31.376]  Well, they are, Alex, and I've got to share something with you because I want to open my sharing with your listeners with a letter I got that's only a paragraph from a career police officer of 35 years who sent out your Obama deception videos to everybody he knows, including senators and congressmen.
[01:18:31.376 --> 01:18:34.337]  Now, let me read this to you, Alex, because this is critical.
[01:18:34.337 --> 01:18:37.157]  He said, Thank you, Steve, so much for the program on Coast to Coast.
[01:18:37.157 --> 01:18:38.138]  You are so enlightening.
[01:18:38.138 --> 01:18:41.618]  I'm a police officer and have been so for 35 years.
[01:18:41.618 --> 01:18:43.779]  Everything you say is absolute truth.
[01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:51.362]  It's a shame the news media is bought off, and the only way you can get this info is through people like you and George that aren't afraid of the government.
[01:18:51.362 --> 01:18:54.163]  We have lost so many rights as citizens of this country, it's frightening.
[01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:59.505]  It's like the Hollywood movie, Wild in the Streets, made in the 60s about when people get our age, they're euthanized.
[01:18:59.505 --> 01:19:01.526]  Here's what he says, Alex, I'm stockpiling ammo.
[01:19:02.086 --> 01:19:05.330]  Food, because I truly believe when they finally take the guns away from the U.S.
[01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:10.858]  citizens, the next thing they will do is kill all law enforcement officers.
[01:19:10.858 --> 01:19:18.648]  There is no doubt in my mind that we'll go through the government computer bank and we'll get their names and addresses off all of us and destroy us and our families.
[01:19:19.108 --> 01:19:22.373]  He says, do not surrender your weapons ever.
[01:19:22.373 --> 01:19:25.117]  That's the only thing that's keeping us around as a country.
[01:19:25.117 --> 01:19:31.107]  I sent an email, the Obama Deception, to everyone I know, including two senators and a congressman that I personally know.
[01:19:31.107 --> 01:19:33.911]  Every citizen should email that clip to their congressman and
[01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:35.774]  Stay there, Steve.
[01:19:35.774 --> 01:19:44.979]  And for those that know about Stalin and Mao and Hitler and the East Germans and Castro, the first group they go after is the cops.
[01:19:44.979 --> 01:19:52.103]  They kill about 30% on average, they put another 30-40% in prison, and then 20% they keep on the payroll.
[01:19:52.103 --> 01:19:54.224]  But normally only a few years.
[01:19:54.224 --> 01:19:58.987]  So the first people they're going to go after, after you've followed orders, is you.
[01:19:58.987 --> 01:19:59.727]  Good point.
[01:19:59.727 --> 01:20:00.488]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.681 --> 01:20:07.986]  If you'd like to replace the ineffective and toxic cleaning products under your sink, you need to visit BioGreenClean.com.
[01:20:07.986 --> 01:20:15.351]  BioGreenClean is the first heavy-duty all-natural multipurpose cleaner that outperforms every other competitive cleaning product on the market today.
[01:20:15.351 --> 01:20:24.037]  BioGreenClean is tough enough to take on the kitchen, the bathroom, your outdoor grill, and virtually anything in your car, home, boat, or office, yet is safe enough for your children and pets.
[01:20:24.037 --> 01:20:26.919]  BioGreenClean does not contain harmful chemical solvents.
[01:20:27.159 --> 01:20:27.819]  We're good to go.
[01:20:50.372 --> 01:21:07.617]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:07.617 --> 01:21:13.499]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:13.499 --> 01:21:19.661]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:19.981 --> 01:21:21.942]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:21.942 --> 01:21:24.422]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:21:24.422 --> 01:21:35.346]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:37.603 --> 01:21:39.264]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.264 --> 01:21:41.145]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:41.145 --> 01:21:48.048]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:21:48.048 --> 01:21:56.312]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:56.312 --> 01:21:57.873]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:57.873 --> 01:21:59.074]  The people strike back.
[01:22:02.561 --> 01:22:04.003]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:10.049]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:22:10.049 --> 01:22:10.870]  That's right.
[01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:13.473]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:22:13.473 --> 01:22:20.641]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:22:21.201 --> 01:22:29.323]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:29.323 --> 01:22:34.804]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:22:34.804 --> 01:22:40.625]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:40.625 --> 01:22:44.726]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:45.407]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.407 --> 01:22:47.249]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:22:47.249 --> 01:22:47.489]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.489 --> 01:22:47.969]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.969 --> 01:22:53.015]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[01:23:08.882 --> 01:23:09.522]  We're good to go!
[01:23:31.749 --> 01:23:32.089]  We're good.
[01:24:06.158 --> 01:24:15.880]  We're going to get into the police state, the cancer viruses and the vaccines, mainstream German news.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:21.141]  We're going to cover it all, coming up today with Steve Quayle.
[01:24:21.141 --> 01:24:24.421]  And in the next hour we're going to open the phones up for Steve Quayle at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:29.417 --> 01:24:35.764]  We're not opening them up until about 40 or 50 after.
[01:24:35.764 --> 01:24:36.786]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:36.786 --> 01:24:38.548]  You can respond to anything you want to discuss.
[01:24:38.548 --> 01:24:41.031]  The demonization campaign against us.
[01:24:41.031 --> 01:24:43.934]  Them coming out and saying, get ready for the militias to attack.
[01:24:43.934 --> 01:24:47.899]  That's your cue for the feds to bomb their own facilities.
[01:24:49.175 --> 01:24:50.956]  I mean, we are entering an incredible time.
[01:24:50.956 --> 01:24:53.678]  Steve, you're finishing up that police officer's letter.
[01:24:53.678 --> 01:24:54.878]  You said you have one more.
[01:24:54.878 --> 01:24:55.939]  I get a lot of these letters, too.
[01:24:55.939 --> 01:24:58.361]  In fact, the guys brought me in a great one yesterday.
[01:24:58.361 --> 01:25:02.083]  I never got to, but yeah, people are really waking up.
[01:25:03.203 --> 01:25:07.266]  And that's good, because the police are really starting to see what's happening.
[01:25:07.266 --> 01:25:07.766]  Go ahead.
[01:25:07.766 --> 01:25:09.908]  Right, and Alex, I want to make it clear.
[01:25:09.908 --> 01:25:18.654]  The time frame, we can't validate the fact that on the 22nd through 26th of August, there's going to be specifically a bank holiday.
[01:25:18.654 --> 01:25:27.840]  But when it's being talked about on multiple continents, by multiple sources, through multiple information sources, whether it's somebody who knows somebody, the friend of a friend stuff isn't what I'm interested in.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:31.363]  It's the guys who are in banking and captains of banking and industry.
[01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:35.727]  Well, talking about a bank holiday may stop it, though, too.
[01:25:35.727 --> 01:25:38.207]  Yes, now listen to this.
[01:25:38.207 --> 01:25:41.928]  Steve, and this is coming from someone very well connected, okay?
[01:25:41.928 --> 01:25:48.650]  Camp San Luis Obispo is training thousands of snipers for civilian unrest and to aid the police.
[01:25:48.650 --> 01:25:57.652]  I know this from people that are in that, uh, I'm kind of paraphrasing this so I don't give anybody, you know, give them away, in that sector.
[01:25:58.252 --> 01:26:06.901]  He said that, listen to this too, he confirmed that they're training troops and that it was indeed to aid the police with the problems that the police cannot handle.
[01:26:06.901 --> 01:26:11.145]  He told me that he is planning on getting out of California as soon as possible.
[01:26:11.145 --> 01:26:15.710]  Also, a friend of mine went target shooting in the National Forest last week and told me, this is in California,
[01:26:16.050 --> 01:26:20.832]  That the fishing game was searching vehicles and taking all weapons if ammo was present.
[01:26:20.832 --> 01:26:22.052]  They are out of control.
[01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:24.373]  A line needs to be drawn in the sand.
[01:26:24.373 --> 01:26:27.074]  And say no more and don't cross or else.
[01:26:27.074 --> 01:26:29.195]  Now let's get to the poster campaign.
[01:26:29.195 --> 01:26:31.836]  Look, you did not start that campaign.
[01:26:31.836 --> 01:26:33.277]  You reported on a campaign.
[01:26:33.277 --> 01:26:36.398]  Now whoever started the Joker poster understands
[01:26:36.918 --> 01:26:42.379]  The value of an image and the statement that an image can make over all the arguments in the world.
[01:26:42.379 --> 01:26:45.280]  We saw the movie Bee for Vendetta.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:53.022]  The thing that I think is riling the powers that be is now, is that the whole country is being brought into this.
[01:26:53.022 --> 01:26:58.523]  And I was listening to the news broadcast and the man saying that whoever is responsible for this, listen.
[01:26:59.023 --> 01:27:02.225]  You did not start this campaign.
[01:27:02.225 --> 01:27:09.951]  And the police asking whoever started it to please turn themselves in is like basically the most inane statement in the world.
[01:27:09.951 --> 01:27:12.652]  Because, Alex, let me share this with your listeners.
[01:27:12.652 --> 01:27:17.236]  I am so concerned, so worried about the next two to three weeks.
[01:27:17.236 --> 01:27:23.380]  Listen, ladies and gentlemen, this is not hyperbole when military is training all across the country
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:26.122]  By the way, I'm going to stop you, Steve.
[01:27:26.122 --> 01:27:27.203]  This is not your opinion.
[01:27:27.203 --> 01:27:30.386]  I keep getting emails saying you and Steve are making this up.
[01:27:30.386 --> 01:27:41.896]  The Pentagon has announced that they've got Homeland Brigades for domestic ops and the governors were in the Associated Press, in fact, print that again for me, on Sunday saying
[01:27:42.296 --> 01:27:44.978]  We don't like the Department of Defense power grab.
[01:27:44.978 --> 01:27:46.820]  What is this martial law?
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:56.028]  And they've already threatened Congress with martial law, and they're having military drills, and the governor of Tennessee said stop it, and the Pentagon said sit down and shut up!
[01:27:56.028 --> 01:27:57.589]  This is really going on!
[01:27:57.589 --> 01:27:59.171]  The time for denial is over!
[01:27:59.551 --> 01:28:01.513]  Yeah, and I've got to tell you something, Alex.
[01:28:01.513 --> 01:28:03.696]  The difference is now we're no longer warning.
[01:28:03.696 --> 01:28:08.041]  We're giving up-to-the-minute reports until the time they shut you off.
[01:28:08.041 --> 01:28:10.023]  Until the time they shut me off.
[01:28:10.023 --> 01:28:14.388]  Ladies and gentlemen, neither Alex Jones or I or anybody else is suicidal.
[01:28:14.388 --> 01:28:16.150]  So that's just total BS.
[01:28:16.150 --> 01:28:17.571]  And I want that clear.
[01:28:17.571 --> 01:28:20.755]  That the identification, vilification, now you're being vilified.
[01:28:21.776 --> 01:28:24.938]  Next step, Alex, is nullification and then destruction.
[01:28:24.938 --> 01:28:37.027]  But I'm saying this to all the devils that are out there, you have absolutely everything to fear from the living God and nothing to fear from the truth except the fact that you'll be exposed.
[01:28:37.027 --> 01:28:39.709]  And Alex, I'm telling you point blank, you don't know this.
[01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:50.316]  But there is a cadre of intercessors, I'm talking about people who really do know how to pray, who really do pray, praying for your safety, my safety, and our safety, that people will get it.
[01:28:50.316 --> 01:28:55.380]  Now the shills from hell, okay, who send you those statements saying that it's our opinions,
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:29:03.785]  I don't spend hundreds of thousands of dollars like you do a year to basically go out and post my opinion.
[01:29:03.785 --> 01:29:05.026]  We post news stories.
[01:29:05.026 --> 01:29:06.467]  We post editorials.
[01:29:06.467 --> 01:29:07.607]  We post blogs.
[01:29:07.607 --> 01:29:09.108]  We detail, detail, detail.
[01:29:09.108 --> 01:29:17.973]  The thing that's different about us and the Shills is the Shills only watch the vomit brokers on mainstream TV or those inane lady reporters.
[01:29:17.973 --> 01:29:19.895]  They think somehow they've got it together.
[01:29:19.895 --> 01:29:23.357]  So, you know, when I get the emails, you and Alex, or you and me,
[01:29:23.877 --> 01:29:25.658]  Individually, together, whatever.
[01:29:25.658 --> 01:29:29.980]  The bottom line is that those are either disinformation agents or just denialists.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:33.862]  And Alex, we are now at a full-scale red alert.
[01:29:33.862 --> 01:29:35.743]  There are too many things happening.
[01:29:35.743 --> 01:29:37.424]  There are too many activities happening.
[01:29:37.424 --> 01:29:38.244]  Steve, stay there.
[01:29:38.244 --> 01:29:39.164]  I agree with you.
[01:29:39.164 --> 01:29:42.846]  I mean, I've been saying get ready for them to demonize the militias.
[01:29:42.846 --> 01:29:45.627]  That's in preparation for staged terror attacks.
[01:29:45.627 --> 01:29:47.849]  Ladies and gentlemen, what are you now seeing?
[01:29:47.849 --> 01:29:50.350]  We are entering the vortex right now.
[01:29:51.226 --> 01:29:55.157]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.157 --> 01:29:57.845]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.745 --> 01:30:05.950]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:09.974]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.974 --> 01:30:15.900]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:20.965]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.965 --> 01:30:21.466]  Number three,
[01:30:21.866 --> 01:30:28.171]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:30:28.171 --> 01:30:31.053]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:30:31.053 --> 01:30:35.577]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:35.577 --> 01:30:39.200]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:45.165]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:30:45.165 --> 01:30:49.849]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:01.052 --> 01:31:04.054]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.054 --> 01:31:09.399]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.399 --> 01:31:11.440]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:16.444]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.444 --> 01:31:17.365]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.625 --> 01:31:18.746]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.746 --> 01:31:20.627]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.627 --> 01:31:21.708]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.708 --> 01:31:23.909]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.909 --> 01:31:25.250]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:26.771]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.771 --> 01:31:32.055]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.055 --> 01:31:35.617]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.617 --> 01:31:39.100]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:40.660]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.561]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.561 --> 01:31:42.681]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.681 --> 01:31:43.601]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.601 --> 01:31:44.701]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.701 --> 01:31:47.742]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:33:13.164 --> 01:33:21.251]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[01:33:21.251 --> 01:33:24.013]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.443]  Take care, my friends.
[01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:36.544]  When you go, you go.
[01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:38.967]  Death's 100%.
[01:33:38.967 --> 01:33:41.250]  But what lives forever is your deeds.
[01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:46.917]  And I'm just so thankful that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[01:33:50.813 --> 01:33:52.574]  Steve Carrell is our guest, going back to him in a moment.
[01:33:52.574 --> 01:33:57.717]  Even though all this craziness is going on, he continues spreading the word like we never have before.
[01:33:57.717 --> 01:34:00.739]  And we've got the white ones, the black ones, they're all in.
[01:34:00.739 --> 01:34:02.640]  We sold out last week, we've got more in.
[01:34:04.526 --> 01:34:06.707]  The black ones are actually the best seller right now.
[01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:10.469]  The second best seller are the white ones with socialism on them.
[01:34:10.469 --> 01:34:14.031]  The black ones with fascism are the number one seller, but here it is.
[01:34:14.031 --> 01:34:15.131]  I meant to wear one of these today.
[01:34:15.131 --> 01:34:16.532]  I will tomorrow.
[01:34:16.532 --> 01:34:18.813]  I like to wash shirts first before I wear them.
[01:34:18.813 --> 01:34:19.713]  Socialism!
[01:34:19.713 --> 01:34:20.294]  There it is!
[01:34:20.874 --> 01:34:28.460]  You see, when they came out and said it should be illegal to put these up and the person should be arrested a week and a half ago, I said, well, I'm going to stand up with the First Amendment.
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:31.662]  We'll put up some free flyers, ask folks to print them up, put them out.
[01:34:31.662 --> 01:34:32.983]  People said you ought to do a contest.
[01:34:32.983 --> 01:34:37.427]  We said, okay, whoever puts up the most in public legal places, you'll win $1,000.
[01:34:37.427 --> 01:34:38.748]  Second place, $500.
[01:34:38.748 --> 01:34:40.109]  Third place, $200.
[01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:42.831]  And that contest and the rules are up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:42.831 --> 01:34:43.631]  Big banner right there.
[01:34:44.505 --> 01:34:51.011]  And then, I started getting demonized by publications and news for it, and now they're saying I need to get arrested.
[01:34:51.011 --> 01:34:54.954]  Not just whoever put him up in Florida, but I need to be arrested.
[01:34:54.954 --> 01:34:58.638]  And it's always some foreigner, can't even speak English, saying, arrest him now!
[01:34:58.638 --> 01:35:01.040]  I mean, these people make me sick.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.023]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, next they'll want to arrest you for this shirt.
[01:35:04.023 --> 01:35:06.305]  We've got to not give in to the chilling effect.
[01:35:06.305 --> 01:35:10.809]  We've got to take action and say no to them and their system.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:15.021]  Because if you don't stand up for something, you will lose it.
[01:35:15.021 --> 01:35:17.443]  And on the back, it's got Infowars.com.
[01:35:17.443 --> 01:35:18.643]  There's a bunch of different variants.
[01:35:18.643 --> 01:35:20.224]  One just says Infowars.com.
[01:35:20.224 --> 01:35:21.624]  Some say In The Fed.
[01:35:21.624 --> 01:35:26.427]  Some of the t-shirts say Wake Up Before It's Too Late or Stop The Criminal Infowars.com.
[01:35:26.427 --> 01:35:28.868]  So a bunch of different variants in black and white.
[01:35:28.868 --> 01:35:29.748]  They say fascist.
[01:35:29.748 --> 01:35:31.389]  They say Infowars.com.
[01:35:31.389 --> 01:35:32.509]  They say New World Order.
[01:35:32.509 --> 01:35:33.970]  They say socialism.
[01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:37.091]  You know, whatever your view is, all these are bad isms.
[01:35:37.091 --> 01:35:40.693]  We've got the shirts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:42.045 --> 01:35:48.852]  We do tell folks, like we've been saying from the start, be sure you put this in areas that are legal and lawful to post them.
[01:35:48.852 --> 01:35:51.414]  According to this Florida town, you can't put it on a power pole.
[01:35:51.414 --> 01:35:53.096]  You can put a lost cat up.
[01:35:53.096 --> 01:35:54.598]  You can put a yard sale up.
[01:35:54.598 --> 01:35:57.440]  You don't put something unflattering.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.902]  That is illegal.
[01:35:58.902 --> 01:36:01.304]  Worshipping the President is the only way.
[01:36:01.304 --> 01:36:03.807]  Our veterans have fought and died so that you don't have free speech.
[01:36:05.737 --> 01:36:10.740]  But again, and then there's all the films you can also get at Infowars.com, not just the t-shirts.
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:31.231]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Generation Rx about the drugging of the kids, Endgame, the whole eugenics plan, Anthrax, War, about the race-specific bioweapons, the Obama deception that you heard Steve Quayle talking about, get them all at Infowars.com, or watch them in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, and we even have the evil Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[01:36:32.071 --> 01:36:34.313]  With Infowars.com on the back.
[01:36:34.313 --> 01:36:42.379]  The establishment really hates this, and this is how we fund our operation to continue standing up against the New World Order.
[01:36:42.379 --> 01:36:45.081]  Speaking of supporting people, folks, you need to support Steve Quayle.
[01:36:45.081 --> 01:36:46.903]  His website is SteveQuayle.com.
[01:36:46.903 --> 01:36:49.525]  Just Google Steve Quayle, best-selling author and researcher.
[01:36:49.525 --> 01:36:51.226]  We'll tell you about those before he leaves us.
[01:36:51.226 --> 01:36:53.428]  Okay, enough of my interruptions, Steve.
[01:36:53.428 --> 01:36:56.370]  I want to take calls in the next hour when you're on with us.
[01:36:56.370 --> 01:36:59.253]  Continuing what you're saying, the next few weeks, next few months,
[01:37:00.675 --> 01:37:04.438]  Red Alert, he's losing a couple of percentage points a week.
[01:37:04.438 --> 01:37:06.639]  I heard a rebroadcast, I said a day.
[01:37:06.639 --> 01:37:09.781]  I say things wrong sometimes, but I always correct it.
[01:37:09.781 --> 01:37:15.085]  He's gone from 80 plus points, slowly dropping, the last two weeks losing two or three points a week.
[01:37:15.085 --> 01:37:18.367]  Most polls show him in the mid to low 40s.
[01:37:18.367 --> 01:37:21.149]  The ones they throw around say 50, 49.
[01:37:21.149 --> 01:37:23.030]  Gallup, Rasmussen shows below 50.
[01:37:24.864 --> 01:37:25.785]  What are they going to do?
[01:37:25.785 --> 01:37:27.927]  I mean, he's a puppet, but he's the puppet.
[01:37:27.927 --> 01:37:30.630]  They've got their whole agenda behind.
[01:37:30.630 --> 01:37:40.100]  So I see them having to stage a terror attack or a shooting or something to demonize these grassroots people that are coming.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.662]  And, you know, they open up the doors and
[01:37:42.843 --> 01:37:55.534]  95% of people are booing and screaming and saying, I'm not partisan, I wasn't paid to come here, I don't want cap-and-trade, I don't want socialist healthcare, Obama's lying, he's been caught lying about what's in the bill, people have gone over that now.
[01:37:55.534 --> 01:38:01.039]  I mean, I see a total loss, like I've never seen, of confidence in this criminal and his controllers.
[01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:04.873]  And that's why I see them now.
[01:38:04.873 --> 01:38:08.660]  I knew they were going to come out and say militias and gun owners are going to kill you.
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:10.484]  The DHS report is real.
[01:38:10.484 --> 01:38:11.886]  The veterans are evil.
[01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:13.930]  Now they're saying that...
[01:38:14.778 --> 01:38:18.019]  The veterans are white supremacists that are going to bomb federal buildings.
[01:38:18.019 --> 01:38:23.880]  They did that last time before they bombed themselves, so that's why I see us going into total red alert.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.800]  Steve Quayle.
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:41.084]  Well, we are at red alert, Alex, and the thing that led me to believe that, or lead me to believe that, is the fact of paratrooper, paratroop drops in the rain north of Cincinnati, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, WAFB Channel 9, talking about the parachute drops.
[01:38:41.084 --> 01:38:42.825]  I mean, not only that, but I'm getting
[01:38:43.505 --> 01:38:44.286]  We're good to go.
[01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:16.437]  I am so absolutely in a period of turmoil, because when I say this, you can no longer just go by the information, waiting for more information.
[01:39:16.437 --> 01:39:17.998]  You've got to get prepared.
[01:39:17.998 --> 01:39:24.562]  And I'm telling everybody I know, Alex, I dealt most of yesterday with people telling me they've got to get out of where they're at.
[01:39:24.562 --> 01:39:27.864]  I'm telling people that they'd better start moving now.
[01:39:27.864 --> 01:39:29.925]  If you live east of the Mississippi,
[01:39:30.265 --> 01:39:38.089]  You should be looking at the mountain places where maybe some old tourist hotels, when I say old, tourist hotels that are unoccupied during the fall.
[01:39:38.089 --> 01:39:43.091]  Go in the winter, go up and rent a place, but get out of where you're at, especially if you've got high visibility.
[01:39:43.091 --> 01:39:56.717]  I can tell you this, the veterans that have heeded my warning, and there are certain things I don't say publicly that they know that can be validated through their own channels, a lot of them have already left the country, I will tell your listeners this,
[01:39:57.117 --> 01:40:12.788]  Now look, it's not what I pretend to know, it's that people who do know let me know when I'm on because, contrary to popular belief, there are still some great people out there that are fighting behind the scenes and dying behind the scenes to basically bring the information to the public.
[01:40:12.788 --> 01:40:22.635]  There has been a war declared on the intelligence community of years ago, especially those that still believe in the Constitution, still believe in their oath, and the Constitution now is vilified.
[01:40:22.635 --> 01:40:25.517]  In these town hall meetings, you cannot bring up the Constitution.
[01:40:25.517 --> 01:40:26.518]  You bring up the Constitution,
[01:40:26.798 --> 01:40:30.459]  That's a one-way ticket out of a meeting usually by pretty burly thugs.
[01:40:30.459 --> 01:40:38.342]  You can count on... And by the way, we're seeing them beat up women, beat up men, beat up blacks that are against Obama because they really don't like that image.
[01:40:38.342 --> 01:40:42.063]  They want to make it that it's all racist to divide us.
[01:40:42.063 --> 01:40:48.625]  Grabbing old men on TV with Spectre and then saying that we're the ones doing it when on video it's them.
[01:40:49.226 --> 01:40:52.027]  Well, I think that people have got to understand something.
[01:40:52.027 --> 01:40:53.848]  They control the images.
[01:40:53.848 --> 01:40:55.709]  They control the speech.
[01:40:55.709 --> 01:40:57.690]  That's why they hate free speech.
[01:40:57.690 --> 01:41:04.572]  Because, see Alex, what's happening now, people have finally been able to say, look it, I no longer have a job.
[01:41:04.572 --> 01:41:10.355]  I no longer have my 401k IRA, where I used to have enough money to retire on, and now I'm being told
[01:41:10.775 --> 01:41:14.017]  I may get to die at 65 because of a health panel.
[01:41:14.017 --> 01:41:18.439]  And by the way, it's interesting, isn't it, that even they... Those death panels are in there!
[01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:24.481]  I've got videos, we've played them, of Rahm Emanuel's brothers saying that he's a bioethicist board.
[01:41:24.481 --> 01:41:27.883]  They say in the documents that they're going to ration care.
[01:41:28.342 --> 01:41:31.884]  Well, and again, ration care, that's eugenics, my brother.
[01:41:31.884 --> 01:41:33.825]  That is absolutely what's going on.
[01:41:33.825 --> 01:41:35.286]  And by the way, they hate that word.
[01:41:35.286 --> 01:41:39.909]  See, they accuse anybody who says, look what they're doing is being Nazis.
[01:41:39.909 --> 01:41:47.073]  And I can say, by the way, your wording is out of a direct speech given by Dr. Mengele.
[01:41:47.073 --> 01:41:48.094]  In one case, it was.
[01:41:48.094 --> 01:41:51.776]  So when I see these people saying that anybody who is contesting their
[01:41:52.236 --> 01:41:54.118]  Do what we say, not as we do.
[01:41:54.118 --> 01:41:59.805]  Oh, okay, well you take the healthcare provisions off, but even the President himself wouldn't answer that question.
[01:41:59.805 --> 01:42:06.893]  So you see, the elitists and the socialists, ah, let's just get rid of that socialist word, the communists, the luciferians,
[01:42:07.353 --> 01:42:07.834]  I don't know.
[01:42:23.317 --> 01:42:27.401]  At San Luis Obispo for the eventual uprising.
[01:42:27.401 --> 01:42:33.225]  That's why the local police are being told that Vietnam veterans and all veterans are potential terrorists.
[01:42:33.225 --> 01:42:36.788]  That, you know, people that quote the Constitution Bill of Rights.
[01:42:36.788 --> 01:42:38.009]  How dare we?
[01:42:38.009 --> 01:42:39.571]  Well, listen, we dare.
[01:42:39.571 --> 01:42:43.074]  And what we're trying to do is save your rear ends in the whole battle.
[01:42:43.074 --> 01:42:44.515]  Because let me share this, Alex.
[01:42:44.515 --> 01:42:45.616]  It is a given.
[01:42:46.116 --> 01:42:55.079]  That once the powers-that-be have utilized local law enforcement, National Guard, and willing military, they all die too.
[01:42:55.079 --> 01:42:56.099]  And that's what we're fighting for.
[01:42:56.099 --> 01:43:02.581]  You see, we're trying to not only fight evil against those who are coming against everything that freedom is based on,
[01:43:02.961 --> 01:43:16.454]  But we're also trying to protect their families, and like the law enforcement officer who sent me that letter stated, he knows, 35 year veteran in law enforcement, that they're going to use his family first of all as a hostage, and then basically they're on the targets too.
[01:43:19.655 --> 01:43:20.736]  It's problematic.
[01:43:20.736 --> 01:43:27.502]  It's absolutely astonishing to me that most people do not get the fact of the lateness of the hour.
[01:43:27.502 --> 01:43:32.166]  I'm getting emails right now while I'm on the air with you, are you going to put up your red screen?
[01:43:32.166 --> 01:43:37.631]  My red screen will simply say, it is time to head to the hills, this thing is on, go for it.
[01:43:37.631 --> 01:43:39.632]  Do I know that they'll keep the internet up?
[01:43:39.632 --> 01:43:40.273]  No.
[01:43:40.273 --> 01:43:45.157]  And again, what I'm trying to do, Alex, is just, I see the difference is that there is no
[01:43:46.338 --> 01:43:49.781]  When I say this, there is no hope of turning it around in my eyes.
[01:43:49.781 --> 01:43:53.804]  There is a hope of getting people to recognize that they need to turn and repent.
[01:43:53.804 --> 01:44:00.369]  See, across the land, there is not one voice, maybe one or a couple, saying that people need to repent in this land.
[01:44:00.369 --> 01:44:04.232]  If people would repent, turn back to God, then things could be different.
[01:44:04.232 --> 01:44:05.473]  But I don't see that.
[01:44:05.473 --> 01:44:13.038]  And see, the deal is that just withstanding the New World Order, you cannot stand against a supernatural force in human force.
[01:44:13.038 --> 01:44:13.799]  It cannot be done.
[01:44:14.238 --> 01:44:21.643]  Well, Steve, you're right, but in every other nation, tyrants take over and they do this, and they really are building FEMA camps.
[01:44:21.643 --> 01:44:25.665]  They really are admitting NORTHCOMS to take over the governors.
[01:44:25.665 --> 01:44:31.389]  I really do have The Hill and the Associated Press, governors oppose DOD emergency powers.
[01:44:32.426 --> 01:44:45.097]  A bipartisan pair of governors is opposing a new Defense Department proposal to handle natural and terrorism-related disasters, contending that a murky chain of command could lead to more problems than solutions.
[01:44:45.097 --> 01:44:47.439]  But they're really whitewashing this.
[01:44:47.439 --> 01:44:48.460]  Well, they're whitewashing it.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:54.885]  Look, the deal is that we're all hearing, and when I say we're all hearing, your sources are different from mine.
[01:44:54.885 --> 01:44:59.009]  People feed you, feed me, but there are people that I know that you've never met and vice versa.
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:01.482]  Well, it's not even that!
[01:45:01.482 --> 01:45:07.656]  They're openly announcing that the main target is the governors in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act!
[01:45:08.050 --> 01:45:31.913]  I agree, but you see Alex, when you and I say that, even though you put it up on your InfoWars.com site, I put it up on SteveQuayle.com, doesn't matter if George Norrie has you or I or anybody on, it's that the people that absolutely go to work from 9 to 5 or basically looking for a job from 9 to 5 are not getting the true news because that's why they're putting the full court
[01:45:32.253 --> 01:45:45.037]  Well, what I'm saying is there's no doubt the Feds are trying to take over, but this is not Russia, Tsarist Russia, or, you know, the poor peasant, you know, Chinese culture, good people, but they'd always been slaves.
[01:45:45.037 --> 01:45:53.020]  This isn't, this Soviet takeover, and that's what it's more akin to, isn't going to work with all these guns, and I see their whole agenda stalling.
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:57.402]  I see them staging terror attacks just to maintain and hold on, Steve.
[01:45:57.402 --> 01:46:00.703]  You're saying you really think they're going to still go for a hot war?
[01:46:01.403 --> 01:46:02.624]  Absolutely.
[01:46:02.624 --> 01:46:04.144]  Absolutely they're going for it.
[01:46:04.144 --> 01:46:05.365]  Absolutely.
[01:46:05.365 --> 01:46:15.250]  Because look, Alex, you don't start killing generals in the National Security Agency for the people that are not aware they have a military hierarchy in the NSA.
[01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:21.432]  You don't start killing them when some of them break ranks and say, look, we're not going to partake in the death of 25 to 50 million Americans.
[01:46:22.893 --> 01:46:25.314]  Yeah, Obama this morning got up with Sotomayor and lied and said,
[01:46:42.521 --> 01:46:47.663]  You know, there's nothing in there to restrict your health care when it's in there!
[01:46:47.663 --> 01:46:47.983]  Right.
[01:46:47.983 --> 01:46:50.284]  Well, forgive me, but I doubt he's read it.
[01:46:50.284 --> 01:46:56.946]  And based on some of the statements coming out of the Senators and Congressmen who have voted for it, they have a
[01:46:58.286 --> 01:46:59.327]  We're good to go.
[01:47:22.601 --> 01:47:23.602]  Look, it's simple.
[01:47:23.602 --> 01:47:26.104]  A bunch of offshore banks came in, took over.
[01:47:26.104 --> 01:47:27.485]  Their philosophy is eugenics.
[01:47:27.485 --> 01:47:30.147]  That's their excuse to do what they do.
[01:47:30.147 --> 01:47:32.968]  The very banks funded Hitler, Stalin, Mao on record.
[01:47:32.968 --> 01:47:34.630]  I've had top historians on.
[01:47:34.630 --> 01:47:36.311]  It's a historical fact.
[01:47:36.311 --> 01:47:45.057]  Carol Quigley, Georgetown's political science head, Bill Clinton's mentor, wrote for the State Department, the CIA, a true history from the 1920s.
[01:47:47.279 --> 01:48:02.358]  to 1968 called Tragedy and Hope, Rothkopf writes books, Rockefeller writes books, they all brag and I want the military and police that aren't awake yet and the public to know you can differ about when they're going to launch it or what's going to happen or what's going to go on.
[01:48:02.358 --> 01:48:03.460]  The globalists have said
[01:48:04.881 --> 01:48:07.183]  They want a hot revolution.
[01:48:07.183 --> 01:48:08.745]  They want to kill people.
[01:48:08.745 --> 01:48:10.847]  They want to line people up and shoot them.
[01:48:10.847 --> 01:48:16.653]  They want to have all their stupid fluoride head guys in uniforms, you know, their youth brigades running around.
[01:48:16.653 --> 01:48:19.216]  You cannot make the magnitude of this up.
[01:48:19.216 --> 01:48:20.757]  It's happened everywhere else.
[01:48:20.757 --> 01:48:21.718]  They want to do it here.
[01:48:21.718 --> 01:48:23.039]  And listen, this is real.
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:25.021]  They really want to do this.
[01:48:25.021 --> 01:48:28.343]  They really have passed a hate bill to restrict free speech.
[01:48:28.343 --> 01:48:33.365]  They really are trying to pass the Cyberbullying Act that says if you hurt their feelings, you're arrested.
[01:48:33.365 --> 01:48:43.291]  They really are building FEMA camps and Steve Quayle, I want to shift gear to the flu because the only thing I think they can launch in October, November that will give them the cover they need
[01:48:44.306 --> 01:48:53.452]  On top of blowing up federal buildings and blaming on us, the only thing they can do to be able to get this through is going to be the flu.
[01:48:53.452 --> 01:49:00.177]  And they're saying we're at level 6, they're saying forced inoculations, they're saying the army is going to forcibly inject us.
[01:49:00.177 --> 01:49:02.859]  I then get emails saying I'm making it up, saying this.
[01:49:02.859 --> 01:49:06.762]  I'm reporting, CNN, Fox, ABC, we've played the clips.
[01:49:08.114 --> 01:49:11.715]  Well, because I don't say it's all wonderful, then I'm the one reporting all this.
[01:49:11.715 --> 01:49:12.515]  No, I don't know!
[01:49:12.515 --> 01:49:13.815]  I want to share something, Alex.
[01:49:13.815 --> 01:49:37.160]  I've spent a good, pretty much the better part of the last decade, okay, ten years, basically cataloging, investigating, researching the death of the leading bioweaponers and molecular biologists, immunologists, and virologists, and a hundred reasons why you should believe that what we're saying is true, that dead who's who in the world of bioengineering, David Kelly's death in itself,
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:45.385]  Head of Port and Down, Ministry of Defense, British Ministry of Defense, and by the way, the thing is is that this is a virus-shedding vaccine.
[01:49:45.385 --> 01:49:51.009]  How is it that it just seems to come along at the same time as an international financial disaster?
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:13.943]  I mean, you can't make up a death toll like that, and then you read, and think, let's get to this now and we come back.
[01:50:13.943 --> 01:50:16.504]  Well, finish your point, and I'm going to get to this.
[01:50:16.504 --> 01:50:20.246]  The German press is reporting this.
[01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:23.488]  I mean, my God, they're going to inject us with weaponized cancer virus?
[01:50:24.605 --> 01:50:31.309]  Yeah, the thing that people have got to understand is this, is that, look, everything I'm saying, I back it up.
[01:50:31.309 --> 01:50:32.589]  Everything you're saying, you back it up.
[01:50:32.589 --> 01:50:42.854]  But even when we use their sources and they criticize the messenger, the ad hominem attack is absolute prima facie evidence they cannot attack the information they have to attack the messenger.
[01:50:42.854 --> 01:50:44.695]  Well, I just want everybody listening.
[01:50:44.695 --> 01:50:47.757]  Do you have some golden ticket from the elite to get out of all this?
[01:50:47.757 --> 01:50:49.278]  I mean, we're all together.
[01:50:50.472 --> 01:50:54.640]  I mean, there's 6,000 elitists, according to the head of the Kissinger Group.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:55.582]  That's all.
[01:50:55.582 --> 01:50:58.829]  If you're not part of that 6,000 folks, you should stand with humanity.
[01:50:58.829 --> 01:51:00.753]  Don't say you haven't been warned.
[01:51:01.701 --> 01:51:07.224]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:51:07.224 --> 01:51:08.004]  and the world.
[01:51:08.004 --> 01:51:11.866]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:51:11.866 --> 01:51:18.368]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:51:18.368 --> 01:51:20.409]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:51:20.409 --> 01:51:28.353]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:51:28.613 --> 01:51:33.317]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:51:33.317 --> 01:51:39.143]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:51:39.143 --> 01:51:41.325]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:51:41.325 --> 01:51:45.008]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[01:51:45.008 --> 01:51:46.930]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[01:51:53.456 --> 01:51:56.657]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.

[01:51:57.577 --> 01:52:06.919]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:06.919 --> 01:52:14.501]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:52:14.501 --> 01:52:20.642]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:21.082 --> 01:52:23.044]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:23.044 --> 01:52:25.546]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:25.546 --> 01:52:37.136]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:37.136 --> 01:52:38.817]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:38.817 --> 01:52:40.679]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:40.679 --> 01:52:46.924]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:52:47.564 --> 01:52:55.833]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:55.833 --> 01:52:57.414]  The Obama Deception.
[01:52:57.414 --> 01:52:58.596]  The people strike back!
[01:53:00.387 --> 01:53:04.150]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[01:53:04.150 --> 01:53:14.296]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.
[01:53:14.296 --> 01:53:21.601]  There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects.
[01:53:21.601 --> 01:53:27.245]  Doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as well.
[01:53:27.245 --> 01:53:30.367]  Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the product.
[01:53:30.387 --> 01:53:31.787]  Call 1-866-295-5305 or go to HBextract.com
[01:54:18.206 --> 01:54:23.067]  We're going to get the articles updated that are on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:23.067 --> 01:54:31.569]  With the artist who did the famous street art, Andre the Giant has a posse.
[01:54:31.569 --> 01:54:35.570]  And then everybody copied that around the country and the world tens of millions of times.
[01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:38.090]  Then he came out with Obey clothing line.
[01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:41.651]  People called him a sellout, but get your political message out.
[01:54:41.651 --> 01:54:42.851]  Unfortunately, it's like communist.
[01:54:42.851 --> 01:54:43.411]  You gotta love it.
[01:54:43.411 --> 01:54:46.272]  It's a communist that makes tens of millions of dollars and has clothing shops, but
[01:54:47.366 --> 01:54:51.907]  That's actually David Rockefeller, you know, his granddaddy said, competition's a sin.
[01:54:51.907 --> 01:54:55.449]  But that's a side issue.
[01:54:55.449 --> 01:54:57.149]  We're happy he's making money.
[01:54:57.149 --> 01:55:00.150]  The issue is he just shouldn't then want to put us in FEMA camps.
[01:55:00.150 --> 01:55:05.752]  But the guy that made the obey signs is the one that made the famous archetypal image of change.
[01:55:07.907 --> 01:55:11.089]  And then Barack Obama sent him a thank you letter.
[01:55:11.089 --> 01:55:15.752]  Dear Shepard, I would like to thank you for using your talent and support of my campaign.
[01:55:15.752 --> 01:55:21.356]  The political message involved in your work have encouraged Americans to believe they can help change the status quo.
[01:55:21.356 --> 01:55:28.200]  Your image has a profound effect on people whether seen in a gallery or on a stop sign.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:31.843]  Oh, Obama wants them to put his image on stop signs, which they were.
[01:55:32.643 --> 01:55:33.944]  In fact, that's what we do.
[01:55:33.944 --> 01:55:42.228]  We write articles showing Obama stuff, and Obama stickers on stop signs, and I've even seen them on mailboxes, and we show that.
[01:55:42.228 --> 01:55:44.489]  So, oh, these criminals are just incredible.
[01:55:44.489 --> 01:55:49.351]  See, they want their speech, but they don't want you having yours, or on a stop sign.
[01:55:49.351 --> 01:55:52.573]  I am privileged to be part of your artwork and proud to have your support.
[01:55:52.573 --> 01:55:53.853]  I wish you continued success.
[01:55:53.853 --> 01:55:55.194]  Barack Obama.
[01:55:55.194 --> 01:55:56.795]  Signed by Barack Obama.
[01:55:57.762 --> 01:56:00.483]  They are just such hypocrites with all these newscasts.
[01:56:00.483 --> 01:56:14.189]  And Drudge Post, the posters we put out with Infowars.com, the Joker, our variant of it that's gone viral with our audience taking action, we commend you, and they put it next to a swastika that wasn't part of our image.
[01:56:14.189 --> 01:56:15.970]  They're trying to set us up, folks.
[01:56:15.970 --> 01:56:19.411]  The Southern Law Center hit us this morning and hit us hard.
[01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:21.552]  The AP hit us.
[01:56:21.552 --> 01:56:22.473]  They're coming after us.
[01:56:22.473 --> 01:56:23.233]  You know why?
[01:56:23.233 --> 01:56:25.334]  Mainly because we're talking about this.
[01:56:26.536 --> 01:56:28.938]  Now, this is on German TV, German radio.
[01:56:28.938 --> 01:56:31.601]  We have the reports up on InfoWars.com.
[01:56:31.601 --> 01:56:34.143]  Does virus vaccine increase the risk of cancer?
[01:56:34.143 --> 01:56:36.986]  Then they go on to admit cancer viruses.
[01:56:36.986 --> 01:56:39.128]  We're going to talk to Steve Quayle right now about this.
[01:56:39.128 --> 01:56:42.431]  The swine flu vaccine has been hit by a new cancer fear.
[01:56:42.431 --> 01:56:45.574]  For a German health expert, they have a shock warning about the safety.
[01:56:46.315 --> 01:56:54.861]  Lung specialist Wolfgang Woderig, I want him on, has said that there are many risks associated with the vaccine for the H1N1 virus.
[01:56:54.861 --> 01:56:59.163]  See, these new advanced genetically engineered viruses are really nanotech, folks.
[01:56:59.163 --> 01:57:04.527]  They're very... The new generations like the Gardasil, all those girls it's killing.
[01:57:04.527 --> 01:57:08.850]  Just Google Gardasil deaths and you'll watch them, blood pouring out, everything.
[01:57:08.850 --> 01:57:12.032]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up!
[01:57:12.032 --> 01:57:14.453]  He has grave reservations about the firm.
[01:57:15.859 --> 01:57:22.144]  Novartis, they're really scary folks, scarier than Baxter, who are developing the vaccine and testing it in Germany.
[01:57:22.144 --> 01:57:26.928]  The vaccination is injected with a very hot needle.
[01:57:26.928 --> 01:57:35.395]  Woodarg said, the nutrient solution for the vaccine consists of cancerous cells from animals and we do not know if there could be an allergic reaction.
[01:57:35.395 --> 01:57:41.360]  Yeah, we know from the 1920s research the Rockefellers funded, we know what's in it.
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.763]  Just like Bayer knew what that HIV and hepatitis would do in Factor VIII.
[01:57:46.772 --> 01:57:47.953]  That came out in their own documents.
[01:57:47.953 --> 01:57:49.674]  They did it on purpose.
[01:57:49.674 --> 01:57:50.574]  Why would you do that?
[01:57:50.574 --> 01:57:53.216]  Because they're psychos, folks.
[01:57:53.216 --> 01:57:57.338]  But more importantly, some people fear that the risk of cancer could be increased by injecting the cells.
[01:57:57.338 --> 01:58:07.805]  The vaccine, as Johannes Lohr, president of the Paul Ehrlich Institute, has pointed out, can also cause worse side effects than the actual swine flu virus.
[01:58:07.805 --> 01:58:09.886]  That's the plan.
[01:58:09.886 --> 01:58:11.487]  We've got one minute before we go to break, but Steve...
[01:58:14.090 --> 01:58:18.612]  Steve Quayle, I mean, this is exactly what you and others have been saying.
[01:58:18.612 --> 01:58:28.338]  Well, again, no one's been saying it longer than I have, and the Spanish flu being re-cultured and brought into the equation, it's not H1N1 that's the issue.
[01:58:28.338 --> 01:58:30.359]  It's not even swine flu.
[01:58:30.359 --> 01:58:37.863]  It's the biological cocktail that these guys have concocted to destroy 5.5 billion people.
[01:58:37.863 --> 01:58:39.504]  By the way, the other quote... Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:39.504 --> 01:58:40.104]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:42.472 --> 01:58:45.879]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.674 --> 01:58:54.916]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.916 --> 01:58:56.917]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.917 --> 01:59:05.441]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.441 --> 01:59:10.984]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.984 --> 01:59:12.605]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.845 --> 01:59:19.374]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.374 --> 01:59:30.428]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.428 --> 01:59:30.889]  That's right.
[01:59:31.169 --> 01:59:33.751]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.

[01:59:53.802 --> 01:59:56.183]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.183 --> 01:59:58.965]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.484 --> 02:00:06.785]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.785 --> 02:00:08.546]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.546 --> 02:00:10.308]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.308 --> 02:00:11.889]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.889 --> 02:00:13.470]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:17.634]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.634 --> 02:00:21.677]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.695 --> 02:00:27.317]  The internet was not really going in 95-96.
[02:00:27.317 --> 02:00:32.441]  There was a few audio screens, but they were intermittent.
[02:00:32.441 --> 02:00:36.764]  I didn't hear a Steve Quayle until 96 when I was sent an audio cassette of him.
[02:00:36.764 --> 02:00:41.748]  Then I got him on, and I remember the first interview, I kind of disagreed with him on a lot of points.
[02:00:41.748 --> 02:00:46.031]  He said, they're going to carry out eugenics, they're going to put it in a flu vaccine, they're going to kill you.
[02:00:46.994 --> 02:00:50.859]  And then years later, I've done deep, deep research, made films.
[02:00:50.859 --> 02:00:51.720]  I realize that's everything.
[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:53.482]  That's why I respect Steve.
[02:00:53.482 --> 02:00:54.564]  That's what kind of scares me, though.
[02:00:54.564 --> 02:01:03.155]  He gets into other areas that I haven't really researched enough, but I know he's a credible guy, so it kind of freaks me out, some of the other stuff he covers, because I hope that isn't accurate.
[02:01:04.444 --> 02:01:09.666]  We know that Steve is very gifted, very intelligent, has a lot of sources, and it's always great to have Steve Quill on with us.
[02:01:09.666 --> 02:01:12.067]  Okay, Steve, you got cut off by the break.
[02:01:12.067 --> 02:01:16.668]  Top German scientist, major institutes, live cancer virus.
[02:01:16.668 --> 02:01:24.471]  We know the cancer, the weaponized cancer program was the name of the AIDS program by the Navy in the seventies.
[02:01:24.471 --> 02:01:27.712]  We know they put it in the vaccines of gay men in New York.
[02:01:27.712 --> 02:01:28.692]  That's declassified.
[02:01:30.441 --> 02:01:33.345]  But then we get demonized saying don't take the shots.
[02:01:33.345 --> 02:01:38.593]  And now here it is in mainstream news that these people are going to be getting cancer viruses.
[02:01:38.593 --> 02:01:39.514]  Go ahead.
[02:01:39.514 --> 02:01:42.459]  Okay, first of all, I want to give two quotes because I didn't say this.
[02:01:43.243 --> 02:01:49.085]  Dr. Henry Kissinger, world population needs to be decreased by 50%, okay?
[02:01:49.085 --> 02:01:50.926]  War and famine would not do instead.
[02:01:50.926 --> 02:01:58.088]  Disease offered the most efficient and fastest way to kill the billions that must soon die if the population crisis is to be solved.
[02:01:58.088 --> 02:02:00.889]  AIDS is not an efficient killer because it's too slow.
[02:02:00.889 --> 02:02:11.853]  My favorite candidate for eliminating 90% of the world's population is airborne Ebola, Ebola Reston, because it's both highly lethal and it kills in days instead of years.
[02:02:12.254 --> 02:02:17.933]  We've got airborne diseases with 90% mortality in humans killing humans.
[02:02:18.755 --> 02:02:19.576]  Think about that.
[02:02:19.576 --> 02:02:21.057]  You know, the bird's food is good, too.
[02:02:21.057 --> 02:02:23.159]  If everyone survives, he will have to bury nine.
[02:02:23.159 --> 02:02:30.625]  That's Dr. Eric Bianca, University of Texas, evolutionary ecologist, and lizard expert.
[02:02:30.625 --> 02:02:31.285]  Okay?
[02:02:31.285 --> 02:02:41.353]  Now, Alex, what I've been trying to get across for the decade and a half I've been on talk radio is the fact that, look, they're not happy with the 28% mortality rate.
[02:02:41.353 --> 02:02:44.376]  They want the 90% mortality rate.
[02:02:44.376 --> 02:02:47.038]  The idea is still, in strange, uh,
[02:02:48.319 --> 02:03:05.175]  I don't even want to go into that, but if these guys are eugenicists at heart, which they are, if they're making statements that everyone's got to die, which they do, then where are you and I off?
[02:03:05.175 --> 02:03:08.839]  And I challenge the mainstream media to have a roundtable.
[02:03:09.179 --> 02:03:09.839]  Exactly.
[02:03:09.839 --> 02:03:10.739]  I mean, here's the deal.
[02:03:10.739 --> 02:03:16.840]  Don't these stupid reporters in New York on CNN and Fox, don't these FBI guys, don't you all understand?
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:19.621]  We're telling you the truth.
[02:03:19.621 --> 02:03:21.361]  We wish this wasn't true.
[02:03:21.361 --> 02:03:23.422]  Believe me, I don't like working 18 hours a day.
[02:03:23.422 --> 02:03:27.242]  I'm sick of this, but I can't get out of this because it's real.
[02:03:27.242 --> 02:03:30.863]  Don't you understand that we're not kooks?
[02:03:30.863 --> 02:03:32.503]  It's all coming true.
[02:03:32.503 --> 02:03:33.523]  It's real.
[02:03:33.523 --> 02:03:35.144]  Mainstream German news.
[02:03:35.144 --> 02:03:36.864]  Cancer viruses in the shots.
[02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:56.259]  You know, the thing that people have got to understand, those who are in the FBI, the DHS, the CIA, DIA, DEA, every four letter and whatever letters are out there, this isn't just about your assigned target for the day, Alex Jones, Steve Quayle, or whatever, this is about your families.
[02:03:56.639 --> 02:04:09.789]  Because the mutagenic nature of these very biologically, and by the way, this is all done in special compartmentalized intelligence, and A doesn't necessarily know how he's connected to B until he sees all the killing.
[02:04:09.789 --> 02:04:12.451]  That's why the hundred scientists had to die.
[02:04:12.451 --> 02:04:13.852]  Alex, listen to me.
[02:04:14.412 --> 02:04:16.895]  Right now, they're going to go hot.
[02:04:16.895 --> 02:04:18.137]  Meaning going hot.
[02:04:18.137 --> 02:04:23.584]  I know you and I probably, if there's any place we disagree on, it's the lateness of the hour, okay?
[02:04:23.584 --> 02:04:28.150]  And when I say disagree... No, Steve, I mean, I just believe we can stop it.
[02:04:28.553 --> 02:04:29.073]  I know.
[02:04:29.073 --> 02:04:38.519]  And I would say this, that the powers that be are anticipating the intentional release of the most deadly biological pathogens.
[02:04:38.519 --> 02:04:41.821]  I don't know if the first series of injections... Stay there, stay there.
[02:04:41.821 --> 02:04:44.802]  You're saying the intel you've got is they're going hot.
[02:04:44.802 --> 02:04:47.804]  We'll see when... When we get back.
[02:04:47.804 --> 02:04:49.465]  The word we've got is October.
[02:04:49.465 --> 02:04:53.708]  But if we get the word out, I believe they will take the green light off.
[02:04:53.708 --> 02:04:54.608]  We better hope so.
[02:04:54.608 --> 02:04:56.649]  And a lot of you are laughing out there.
[02:04:56.649 --> 02:04:57.710]  Later you may not be laughing.
[02:05:00.598 --> 02:05:05.905]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:05:05.905 --> 02:05:10.431]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:05:10.431 --> 02:05:12.714]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:05:12.714 --> 02:05:14.336]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:05:14.336 --> 02:05:15.378]  There is a solution.
[02:05:15.598 --> 02:05:24.023]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:06:00.845 --> 02:06:06.052]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:06:06.052 --> 02:06:10.097]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:10.097 --> 02:06:15.685]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.985 --> 02:06:16.626]  It's true.
[02:06:16.626 --> 02:06:21.970]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.970 --> 02:06:28.276]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:06:28.276 --> 02:06:31.178]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:06:31.178 --> 02:06:35.682]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:35.682 --> 02:06:39.305]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:06:39.525 --> 02:06:45.268]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:06:45.268 --> 02:06:49.971]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:00.396 --> 02:07:01.777]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:07:01.777 --> 02:07:03.777]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:07:03.777 --> 02:07:04.758]  Well, you should.
[02:07:04.758 --> 02:07:09.260]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.

[02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:34.315]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:07:34.315 --> 02:07:39.839]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[02:08:06.078 --> 02:08:08.340]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[02:08:09.125 --> 02:08:10.887]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.887 --> 02:08:12.469]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.469 --> 02:08:14.031]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:14.031 --> 02:08:18.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.216 --> 02:08:23.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.221 --> 02:08:26.205]  We are going to your phone calls in just one moment.
[02:08:26.205 --> 02:08:29.268]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[02:08:30.413 --> 02:08:33.654]  The key to all of this is to understand that only a bioweapon release
[02:08:51.619 --> 02:09:06.147]  serves the purpose of making everyone suspect in the pretext of lockdown cities bring in federal troops so they can then pose as the savior, set the precedent, make the troops feel like it's okay what they're doing, make the cities feel like it's okay what they're doing.
[02:09:06.147 --> 02:09:12.391]  A total economic collapse can do that but still the feds get blamed even though they play the part of the savior.
[02:09:12.391 --> 02:09:15.633]  So the globalists are all about scripting and how to pose as the savior.
[02:09:17.059 --> 02:09:26.101]  And we see them, I said back in January and February, I said I'm looking for them to release a controlled flu, but not that the flu would be real.
[02:09:26.101 --> 02:09:28.922]  We said back in April, we don't know if this is real or not, or just hype.
[02:09:28.922 --> 02:09:32.223]  And a lot of scientists are saying this is no big deal.
[02:09:32.223 --> 02:09:35.243]  Some, like Nyman we've had on, do say it's a big deal.
[02:09:35.243 --> 02:09:38.924]  Steve's been saying it's gonna be the vaccine that's gonna have it.
[02:09:38.924 --> 02:09:45.506]  And a lot of scientists are saying, and they're admitting it has live cancer viruses in it, and cancer cells.
[02:09:46.562 --> 02:09:49.064]  So, we were just reporting on that.
[02:09:49.064 --> 02:09:52.466]  Steve, finish up what you were trying to say.
[02:09:52.466 --> 02:09:58.911]  I'm simply trying to say is that everything you were talking about, you believe that they won't give it the green light.
[02:09:58.911 --> 02:10:00.512]  I'm telling you, they've given it the green light.
[02:10:00.512 --> 02:10:03.774]  Now, let me just have a minute to tell people why, okay?
[02:10:03.774 --> 02:10:07.177]  The thing is, they would not be deploying the military to the extent they have.
[02:10:07.177 --> 02:10:10.039]  They would not have GPS gun owners to the extent they have.
[02:10:10.459 --> 02:10:23.073]  The reports that I'm coming in, and when I say this, I'm talking eyewitness listeners of yours and mine, Cobra helicopter gunships over State College last week, A-10 Warthogs flying low over Cincinnati, Metro Suburban Neighborhood.
[02:10:23.073 --> 02:10:29.820]  No, no, they admit under NLE09, 14 other countries to take over America, and I mean, that's all admitted.
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:34.504]  I'm not saying it hasn't been green-lighted, but we know there's an operation going.
[02:10:34.504 --> 02:10:38.368]  The question is, what is the operation and will they fully carry it out?
[02:10:38.368 --> 02:10:41.130]  I agree they're moving the assets into place.
[02:10:41.130 --> 02:10:43.873]  I'm seeing the pre-preparation propaganda.
[02:10:43.873 --> 02:10:44.653]  I agree with you.
[02:10:44.653 --> 02:10:49.518]  I'm just saying if we stand up and expose it, won't they have to back down or you're saying they can't pull out?
[02:10:50.838 --> 02:10:54.681]  Because of the commitment of all the foreign troops and everything, I don't believe outside.
[02:10:54.681 --> 02:10:55.942]  Now, let me make this clear.
[02:10:55.942 --> 02:10:57.723]  I am the one who believes in miracles.
[02:10:57.723 --> 02:10:59.404]  I have said it, and I believe.
[02:10:59.404 --> 02:11:00.985]  I seriously believe, Alex.
[02:11:00.985 --> 02:11:06.409]  If enough people will repent, and I don't know that it can stop it, but my issue is this for everyone.
[02:11:06.409 --> 02:11:06.949]  Just like you.
[02:11:06.949 --> 02:11:07.830]  You have listeners.
[02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:08.470]  I have listeners.
[02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:09.511]  We have listeners.
[02:11:09.511 --> 02:11:11.792]  Coast to Coast has all the listeners.
[02:11:11.792 --> 02:11:13.594]  I mean, you know, additional listeners.
[02:11:13.594 --> 02:11:14.154]  A lot of them.
[02:11:14.154 --> 02:11:18.557]  But I'm saying this, is look, the thing that's left out of the equation, in my opinion,
[02:11:18.877 --> 02:11:26.822]  And because it is a spiritual battle, because these people openly worship Lucifer, having Luciferian human sacrifices, I would say this.
[02:11:26.822 --> 02:11:40.611]  Do you really think that there is a position in all this argument between all of us and all of them that the God of Heaven, which America used to worship, acknowledge, and be grateful for, has a specific characteristic
[02:11:40.931 --> 02:11:41.371]  I don't know.
[02:11:56.617 --> 02:11:59.200]  Nailed with emails, quails talking about God again.
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:01.182]  Well, I'm sharing this with people.
[02:12:01.182 --> 02:12:12.132]  If everyone's dying of a vaccine and by simply recognizing the fact that, number one, they don't have to take it, number two, that with sorting all this stuff out, there's so many voices out there.
[02:12:12.512 --> 02:12:14.352]  What repentance is?
[02:12:14.352 --> 02:12:17.953]  In a simple word, thank God, I'm sorry, I've tried to live my life without you.
[02:12:17.953 --> 02:12:22.774]  You know, Alex, you're saying, you just quoted a minute ago, that you're going to live in the house of the Lord forever.
[02:12:22.774 --> 02:12:30.556]  Yeah, but others need to know this, too, that God's abiding presence will never... Jesus said He'll never leave us or forsake us, okay?
[02:12:30.556 --> 02:12:34.337]  But the point is that these people that worship Lucifer want us dead.
[02:12:34.717 --> 02:13:03.957]  I do not believe, short of repentance on the level of Nineveh, that this thing can be stopped, because the assets, and you know this, you said it on the air, you know, we're, our families are threatened incessantly, we're threatened incessantly, we've got spooks on us night and day, and the deal is, is that they would not be doing that, assigning 1,000 cyber warriors to try and come after you, come after me, if they weren't worried about the one thing that they cannot control, and that's
[02:13:05.898 --> 02:13:09.219]  Well, I agree with you and I have a personal relationship with the Creator.
[02:13:09.219 --> 02:13:16.383]  My issue is they've created this counterfeit church so when you get into it people then get pushed into the New World Order system, but you explained that.
[02:13:16.383 --> 02:13:23.226]  But even if somebody's an atheist, we have to admit we're screwed up and admit we're bad and admit this is a sick society.
[02:13:23.966 --> 02:13:27.489]  And admit that we've got to change our ways or it's only going to get worse.
[02:13:27.489 --> 02:13:29.191]  Things are deteriorating.
[02:13:29.191 --> 02:13:31.092]  Things are getting evil.
[02:13:31.092 --> 02:13:33.214]  Things are falling apart.
[02:13:33.214 --> 02:13:35.796]  And it is because we've turned into wicked devils.
[02:13:35.796 --> 02:13:38.178]  And the elite know there is a God.
[02:13:38.178 --> 02:13:43.583]  And they worship the wicked creation of the Creator.
[02:13:43.583 --> 02:13:45.024]  And they really believe in all this.
[02:13:45.024 --> 02:13:46.785]  That's what makes me a believer.
[02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:49.187]  I look at the New World Order and they are believers.
[02:13:49.187 --> 02:13:50.849]  But they're believers on the other side.
[02:13:51.209 --> 02:13:51.889]  Absolutely.
[02:13:51.889 --> 02:13:55.950]  So the issue is not are Alex and Steve just making up stuff.
[02:13:55.950 --> 02:14:09.713]  Why don't people do their homework and recognize that, hey, if they acknowledge that there's a devil and even use the name of Jesus as an anathema, meaning it's forbidden to them, then the bottom line is that maybe someone should consider that there really is more to the spiritual plight.
[02:14:09.713 --> 02:14:13.634]  By the way, Alex, eyewitness reports coming out of Nampa, Idaho.
[02:14:13.634 --> 02:14:14.754]  Nampa, Idaho, okay?
[02:14:15.154 --> 02:14:23.945]  Confirm hearing foreign commanders ordering local law enforcement officers, EMTs, fire and airport officials in drills in the middle of the night.
[02:14:23.945 --> 02:14:25.847]  Now that's in Nampa, Idaho.
[02:14:25.847 --> 02:14:29.251]  Foreign commanders ordering local law enforcement officers.
[02:14:29.251 --> 02:14:31.935]  Everybody better realize that when who declared a level six
[02:14:32.555 --> 02:14:39.277]  Alert, okay, pandemic, global pandemic alert, that that put us effectively under control of the United Nations.
[02:14:39.277 --> 02:14:41.157]  And guess who the security cause was?
[02:14:41.157 --> 02:14:44.138]  Russia, China, U.S., and all the other nations.
[02:14:44.138 --> 02:14:47.699]  So it should come as no surprise that something is afoot.
[02:14:47.699 --> 02:14:50.020]  I do not believe it can be pulled back.
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:57.042]  I believe it's gone hot, and I believe the days ahead are going to be the most perilous that this country has ever experienced in its entire life.
[02:14:57.242 --> 02:15:04.676]  You don't think the people going to all the town halls and saying no and the poll numbers plunging will make the establishment back off?
[02:15:04.676 --> 02:15:05.738]  I think if people thought
[02:15:07.714 --> 02:15:13.196]  I think if the establishment thought Obama was still going to be messianic, they were building him up for this.
[02:15:13.196 --> 02:15:18.778]  I just see them, they always try over and over again, and this is their biggest try so far.
[02:15:18.778 --> 02:15:21.199]  I just don't see it going well for them if they do engage.
[02:15:21.199 --> 02:15:24.760]  Well, and let me say this, I'm not telling anybody not to do those things.
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:34.204]  I'm also of the opinion that immediately, those of men, the men and women of means, and who have the ability, we should be having recall petitions going out.
[02:15:34.204 --> 02:15:37.325]  But here's the deal, the question then becomes on the other side of it.
[02:15:37.845 --> 02:15:41.647]  Does that even threaten them more to move up their time frame?
[02:15:41.647 --> 02:16:00.056]  I think, Alex, that the bottom line is the advantage of informing people is if we get that extra law enforcement officer, if we get that extra DEA agent, if we get the extra border patrol guy, if we save their families' lives and they finally come to grips with the fact that, hey, if we're ordered to any part of the United States,
[02:16:00.356 --> 02:16:01.077]  We're good to go.
[02:16:16.139 --> 02:16:23.604]  And by the way, in 1988, they tried to make a federal law where all cable systems and phones, where the feds would dial in and give you messages.
[02:16:23.604 --> 02:16:34.712]  We just put up an Idaho news article, KPAK.com, Idaho officials working on statewide alert system, where Homeland Security takes over the radio, the phone, everything.
[02:16:34.712 --> 02:16:43.617]  I told people this in Police State 2000 in 1999, because I work in radio, and FEMA came in and took over and put in their control box where everything goes through them.
[02:16:43.617 --> 02:16:45.859]  It is all really coming together right now, Steve.
[02:16:46.539 --> 02:16:48.740]  Hey, good morning Alex.
[02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:50.240]  Hey, good morning Steve.
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:50.980]  Good morning.
[02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:53.320]  Yeah, just to remind people, to remind the listeners of May 13th, 1985,
[02:17:14.693 --> 02:17:22.395]  The city of Philadelphia dropped a bomb on the Move Mom organization and burned down a whole city block.
[02:17:22.395 --> 02:17:29.456]  Now, a lot of people have been knowing that the government and the system is capable of these things.
[02:17:29.456 --> 02:17:42.820]  Certain people have been targeted in the past, and you know, it's been, you know, people haven't come out and really supported these other humans like they really should have in this time of genocide.
[02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:44.260]  Now, as far as Alex,
[02:17:45.069 --> 02:17:47.492]  My personal opinion, I don't think you're racist.
[02:17:47.492 --> 02:17:50.135]  I'm a person of color, and um...
[02:17:51.089 --> 02:17:54.691]  I don't think it really matters if you're racist or not, in all honesty.
[02:17:54.691 --> 02:17:57.233]  I mean, your information is crucial.
[02:17:57.233 --> 02:18:05.099]  And certain information that you share with the audience, it doesn't have anything to do with racism.
[02:18:05.099 --> 02:18:15.586]  But a real racist wouldn't make a film like Endgame about how they're targeting black and hispanic babies for abortion and infanticide and injecting black people with syphilis.
[02:18:16.556 --> 02:18:19.337]  It's the people that talk about race all day.
[02:18:19.337 --> 02:18:29.661]  They want to get everybody fighting with each other so they can... I mean, Margaret Sanger and Rockefellers brag how they come up and pose to the community groups to kill you!
[02:18:29.661 --> 02:18:33.882]  Right, and you have been coming out with the crucial information.
[02:18:33.882 --> 02:18:43.426]  Now, not to say that people of color could still, you know, be critical and, you know... Because, for instance, the King-Alfred plan
[02:18:44.088 --> 02:18:51.054]  And the update of that REC-84 plan, that needs to be read on the air to your million of listeners.
[02:18:51.054 --> 02:19:08.489]  This is an eight hour plan of how they're going to localize all the enforcement, and then come in and divide up the families, put people in concentration camps, and then their endgame is the mass burn trash incinerary that get up to 5,000 degrees.
[02:19:08.489 --> 02:19:10.010]  That is what they're trying to do.
[02:19:10.010 --> 02:19:13.213]  This is their final solution because in Nazi Germany,
[02:19:13.595 --> 02:19:21.085]  They were killing 10,000 people a day, and the ash from burning up folks caused the bottleneck.
[02:19:21.085 --> 02:19:24.089]  So it slowed down the production, per se.
[02:19:25.643 --> 02:19:26.604]  Well, God bless you.
[02:19:26.604 --> 02:19:27.964]  Comment side effects.
[02:19:27.964 --> 02:19:30.845]  We've got to go to break, but God bless you and your points.
[02:19:30.845 --> 02:19:32.065]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[02:19:32.065 --> 02:19:33.946]  Quick comment, Steve Quayle, on what he was saying.
[02:19:33.946 --> 02:19:45.670]  Well, first of all, I agree with what he was saying about the endgame, and that is to basically kill the people and incinerate them and get them out of every form of eyesight possible.
[02:19:45.670 --> 02:19:50.071]  But I think that more importantly, Alex, is that they have an endgame.
[02:19:50.071 --> 02:19:51.852]  And remember, this is The Globalist.
[02:19:51.852 --> 02:19:52.772]  This isn't just the
[02:19:53.232 --> 02:19:55.072]  Willing dupes in the U.S.
[02:19:55.072 --> 02:19:56.113]  military, the U.S.
[02:19:56.113 --> 02:19:57.893]  law and justice.
[02:19:57.893 --> 02:19:58.353]  Stay there!
[02:19:58.353 --> 02:19:58.713]  Stay there!
[02:19:58.713 --> 02:19:59.994]  Explain when we get back.
[02:19:59.994 --> 02:20:01.534]  Steve Coyle.

[02:21:01.226 --> 02:21:03.207]  Jim Newcomer, from Midas Resources, August 12, 2009.
[02:21:03.207 --> 02:21:04.047]  Gold opened this morning at $9.4560.
[02:21:04.047 --> 02:21:07.229]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7267, $4.8634 for a half-ounce, or $2.4317 for the quarter-ounce.
[02:21:07.229 --> 02:21:07.789]  That's $9.7267, $4.8634, or $2.4317.
[02:21:19.235 --> 02:21:23.158]  Bailout equals market distortions, increased money supply while productivity is going down.
[02:21:23.158 --> 02:21:27.362]  Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede.
[02:21:27.362 --> 02:21:31.966]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share, paying fat dividends.
[02:21:31.966 --> 02:21:37.491]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins are decreasing rapidly, leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[02:21:37.491 --> 02:21:40.714]  Fiat currency's value is based on trust, fiscal responsibility.
[02:21:40.714 --> 02:21:45.458]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust, or is it time to ensure your hard-earned wealth?
[02:21:45.578 --> 02:21:50.882]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237.
[02:21:50.882 --> 02:21:53.484]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems?
[02:21:53.484 --> 02:21:55.325]  Or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[02:21:55.325 --> 02:21:56.166]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.869 --> 02:22:07.695]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:22:07.695 --> 02:22:15.263]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[02:22:15.263 --> 02:22:21.430]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:21.850 --> 02:22:23.831]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:23.831 --> 02:22:26.332]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:22:26.332 --> 02:22:37.897]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:37.897 --> 02:22:39.578]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.578 --> 02:22:41.438]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:22:41.438 --> 02:22:47.641]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:56.609]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.609 --> 02:22:58.191]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:58.191 --> 02:22:59.373]  The people strike back!
[02:23:01.425 --> 02:23:03.928]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[02:23:03.928 --> 02:23:06.271]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[02:23:06.271 --> 02:23:10.517]  The price of food continues to rise, and the economy continues to falter.
[02:23:10.517 --> 02:23:12.800]  You know that you need to prepare.
[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:16.605]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[02:23:16.605 --> 02:23:19.669]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:23:20.189 --> 02:23:32.577]  At OrganicaSeed.com you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[02:23:32.577 --> 02:23:35.019]  Imagine growing your very own fresh vegetables!
[02:23:35.199 --> 02:23:35.559]  I think so.
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:05.621]  We've got a report here.
[02:24:05.621 --> 02:24:15.128]  A man, two hours before Obama was going to be in a town from New Hampshire, was on the street with a gun and opened view and they arrested him for not having a license.
[02:24:15.128 --> 02:24:18.891]  There's no license to own a gun in New Hampshire, Texas, Vermont.
[02:24:18.891 --> 02:24:25.396]  They give you a license to conceal because under the common law, concealing a weapon is illegal.
[02:24:25.396 --> 02:24:28.699]  So, they are definitely getting upset about that.
[02:24:28.699 --> 02:24:31.341]  We've got a guest coming on the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[02:24:33.297 --> 02:24:45.300]  Who was on hardball and the rest of it with the loaded handgun down the street from the event at a Free State Project event to show that people are going to openly demonstrate the Second Amendment so we don't lose it.
[02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:47.041]  That gentleman is joining us.
[02:24:47.041 --> 02:24:49.381]  I want to keep taking calls here for Steve Quayle.
[02:24:49.381 --> 02:24:51.822]  George in Illinois, you're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[02:24:51.822 --> 02:24:53.102]  Go ahead.
[02:24:53.102 --> 02:24:54.443]  Hey Jones, how you doing?
[02:24:54.443 --> 02:24:55.643]  Good.
[02:24:55.643 --> 02:24:59.344]  Hey, I haven't seen you mention this on the website, but
[02:25:00.283 --> 02:25:08.365]  The bill to audit the Fed and the Senate has 23 sponsors, and even some big globalists like McCain and both of your senators are co-sponsoring it.
[02:25:08.365 --> 02:25:20.909]  Yeah, we constantly link to the 287 or whatever it is sponsors in the House, the 20 plus in the Senate, and the film I'm making.
[02:25:20.909 --> 02:25:26.590]  I mean, I gotta admit, when I'm spending 8, 9, 10 hours a day just on this film, it's hard to make one of these films.
[02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:29.331]  And we got like 4 guys in here, 5 guys total making it.
[02:25:31.446 --> 02:25:33.006]  Yeah, and one more thing for Steve.
[02:25:33.006 --> 02:25:37.127]  He really needs to check out that book, The Family, by that Jeff Charlotte that you had on.
[02:25:37.127 --> 02:25:38.728]  That is an amazing expose on the phony Christians.
[02:26:00.988 --> 02:26:12.279]  And the fact that everybody is waking up to the New World Order, I want to warn the Feds that they bombed the Oklahoma City building in 95 and demonized the Liberty Movement when Oklahoma passed a law against U.N.
[02:26:12.279 --> 02:26:13.280]  takeover.
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:15.122]  That isn't going to work this time.
[02:26:15.122 --> 02:26:17.324]  People now know the New World Order is real.
[02:26:17.324 --> 02:26:20.147]  Steve, well, I mean, how do you see this unfolding?
[02:26:20.879 --> 02:26:25.723]  Well, first of all, I think that they have to go hot because they know that the people are awakening.
[02:26:25.723 --> 02:26:31.969]  The audit, the Fed, listen, you've got control of the nation's money, you've got control of the nation.
[02:26:31.969 --> 02:26:38.074]  That's what lobbyists are, that's what payoffs are, bribery, and when payoffs and bribery don't work, then you use blackmail.
[02:26:38.074 --> 02:26:41.237]  So that's why I believe things are going to have to go really hot.
[02:26:41.237 --> 02:26:43.679]  Also, I think people are losing track of the fact that
[02:26:44.039 --> 02:26:48.562]  There are extraneous events to us that are taking place right now, i.e.
[02:26:48.562 --> 02:26:49.483]  Israel and Iran.
[02:26:49.483 --> 02:26:51.204]  Now, why is that important to us?
[02:26:51.204 --> 02:27:03.291]  It is my contention that the devils that are that know how to go for what's going on in this country will most likely try and link and sync with a major world event so they can cover up their nefarious deeds.
[02:27:03.291 --> 02:27:06.613]  In other words, a worldwide traumatic event.
[02:27:06.613 --> 02:27:10.536]  And you know what Tommy Frank said, the minute a nuclear weapon goes off in the United States,
[02:27:10.956 --> 02:27:13.158]  The bottom line is it's all over the Constitution.
[02:27:13.158 --> 02:27:27.407]  It's my, what would you say, learned and calculated thought process that we are going to see multiple events taking place, and that they will use an international event, whether it's London going up, or D.C.
[02:27:27.407 --> 02:27:36.373]  or New York going up, meaning going up by a nuclear weapon, that it's going to be the false spike scenario, it's going to be integrated, and listen Alex,
[02:27:36.833 --> 02:27:50.504]  They don't ever intend to give up power, so anytime there's a threat to their power, they have to take the eyes of the awakened off of the events that led up to their awakening and substitute something else.
[02:27:50.504 --> 02:27:59.911]  So what I'm saying is, is they will come up with a false flag, or multiple false flags, tying it into an international event, and then, you know, their killing spree begins in this country.
[02:28:01.431 --> 02:28:10.099]  See, I see them testing the flu to see if they can get people to take the shots, and then beta testing each time for a bigger event.
[02:28:10.099 --> 02:28:15.845]  I see the incremental system where they contract, we push back, they release some of the contraction.
[02:28:15.845 --> 02:28:19.649]  Then they contract again, we push back, they release some of the contraction.
[02:28:19.649 --> 02:28:23.593]  As soon as we give up again, think we've won, they contract again.
[02:28:23.593 --> 02:28:25.655]  That's the technique I see them using
[02:28:27.262 --> 02:28:29.544]  As they try to get control of us.
[02:28:29.544 --> 02:28:31.146]  But, I mean, I just hope you're wrong, Steve.
[02:28:31.146 --> 02:28:32.087]  You've been writing about it a lot.
[02:28:32.087 --> 02:28:32.788]  Can I tell you something?
[02:28:32.788 --> 02:28:34.629]  I hope I'm wrong, but you've got to say this.
[02:28:34.629 --> 02:28:36.131]  You said it at the opening case.
[02:28:36.131 --> 02:28:42.277]  I called this one 12 to 13 years ago on how the flu would be utilized as a bioweapon.
[02:28:42.277 --> 02:28:43.959]  You actually did it longer ago than that.
[02:28:43.959 --> 02:28:45.440]  You did it in, well, yeah, 96.
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:46.361]  I guess that's 13.
[02:28:48.510 --> 02:29:05.073]  Well, the deal is that all I'm trying to say is that, look, I hope I'm wrong too, but we're seeing too many things taking place that suggest that, look, go back to that little formula, identification, vilification, nullification,
[02:29:05.473 --> 02:29:14.820]  Yeah, it was Chris Matthews who should be arrested by the FBI for stating on his show that everybody that doesn't buy the health bill, do you see the art of the quote?
[02:29:14.820 --> 02:29:18.463]  He said they should be strapped down and injected with scopalamine.
[02:29:18.463 --> 02:29:21.064]  In essence, they should be lethally injected.
[02:29:21.064 --> 02:29:23.927]  Now, excuse me, is that not a hateful thing to say?
[02:29:23.927 --> 02:29:25.968]  But see Alex, it's double standards.
[02:29:25.968 --> 02:29:27.569]  What works for them is acceptable.
[02:29:27.569 --> 02:29:29.791]  What works against them must be put down at all costs.
[02:29:30.711 --> 02:29:34.553]  Well, yeah, like Obama says put his poster up on stop signs.
[02:29:34.553 --> 02:29:35.874]  We're saying don't do that.
[02:29:35.874 --> 02:29:39.056]  Put it up on legal places and they're saying arrest me.
[02:29:39.056 --> 02:29:42.178]  So you can have the Obama thing as him as hope and change.
[02:29:42.178 --> 02:29:43.679]  You can't with me.
[02:29:43.679 --> 02:29:44.679]  Steve, stay there.
[02:29:44.679 --> 02:29:51.664]  More phone calls with Steve Quayle straight ahead.
[02:29:51.664 --> 02:29:53.044]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.044 --> 02:29:55.586]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.586 --> 02:29:58.268]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.462 --> 02:30:04.464]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.464 --> 02:30:09.809]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:09.809 --> 02:30:11.850]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:11.850 --> 02:30:16.854]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:16.854 --> 02:30:17.775]  How much do you want?
[02:30:18.015 --> 02:30:19.156]  When do you want it?
[02:30:19.156 --> 02:30:21.038]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:21.038 --> 02:30:22.118]  When will you need it?
[02:30:22.118 --> 02:30:24.300]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:25.641]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.641 --> 02:30:27.183]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:27.183 --> 02:30:32.447]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.447 --> 02:30:36.030]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:39.513]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:39.853 --> 02:30:41.074]  How much will you need?
[02:30:41.074 --> 02:30:41.975]  We don't know.
[02:30:41.975 --> 02:30:43.076]  How much do you want?
[02:30:43.076 --> 02:30:44.017]  All you can get.
[02:30:44.017 --> 02:30:45.119]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.119 --> 02:30:48.162]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:48.162 --> 02:30:49.924]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:49.924 --> 02:30:50.845]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.458 --> 02:31:05.765]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.765 --> 02:31:10.311]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.311 --> 02:31:12.574]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.574 --> 02:31:14.216]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.216 --> 02:31:15.238]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.458 --> 02:31:23.880]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:31.342]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:31:31.342 --> 02:31:37.004]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:31:37.384 --> 02:31:43.409]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:31:43.409 --> 02:31:47.553]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:32:00.435 --> 02:32:04.657]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:32:04.657 --> 02:32:06.657]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:32:06.657 --> 02:32:15.180]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:20.742]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:32:20.742 --> 02:32:22.343]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:32:22.603 --> 02:32:29.111]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:32:29.111 --> 02:32:40.184]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[02:32:40.184 --> 02:32:40.645]  That's right.
[02:32:40.925 --> 02:32:43.486]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:32:43.486 --> 02:32:45.306]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[02:32:45.306 --> 02:32:45.566]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:32:45.566 --> 02:32:48.127]  Or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:32:48.127 --> 02:32:48.767]  That's acolablue.com.
[02:33:14.169 --> 02:33:21.212]  When Steve Quayle tells you a lot of elitist and a lot of patriots and people are leaving the country, it really is happening.
[02:33:21.212 --> 02:33:22.993]  And I hope we can back the globalist off.
[02:33:22.993 --> 02:33:26.275]  That's why the maximum effort is needed right now.
[02:33:26.275 --> 02:33:30.397]  We are going to continue with your phone calls.
[02:33:30.397 --> 02:33:31.898]  Dan, Alex, Randy,
[02:33:33.576 --> 02:33:55.405]  Manette and others that are patiently holding told her number to join us 1-800-259-9231 There have been some other big new developments a man arrested outside Obama event Loaded guns hours before Obama even showed up and actually just the nearby in the area So now they're just grabbing gun owners searching cars
[02:33:57.369 --> 02:34:00.352]  Does virus vaccine increase the risk of cancer?
[02:34:00.352 --> 02:34:04.115]  Major German news reports live cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[02:34:04.115 --> 02:34:18.868]  Over the next five, six minutes, I want to bring our sponsor up because even though the world is crazy, we'd all continue to go on living and preparing ourselves and trying to save money and also thanking all of our sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[02:34:19.665 --> 02:34:29.541]  And Marty Schachter, World War II vet in the Chemical Corps, came back from World War II with his papa, and now with his son and their family, 60-plus years later.
[02:34:29.541 --> 02:34:30.021]  What's 47 to 2009?
[02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:36.570]  It's almost 70 years, that's incredible.
[02:34:36.570 --> 02:34:39.911]  Just absolutely amazing.
[02:34:39.911 --> 02:34:59.475]  Marty Schachter joins us, family-owned business out in Oakland, California, high quality, organic, before organic was cool soap, and he only did factory direct to major hospitals and hotels and wealthy organizations and groups.
[02:35:00.669 --> 02:35:08.996]  Genesis got him as a sponsor, because Michael Trudeau, who used to be a sales manager here, was a fan of organic stuff, and actually an environmentalist, but a conservative one.
[02:35:08.996 --> 02:35:13.199]  You know, somebody who was still into organic stuff, but not a communist, basically.
[02:35:13.199 --> 02:35:14.720]  And got him as a sponsor.
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:16.021]  And I got sent some of the soap.
[02:35:16.021 --> 02:35:17.683]  My wife wanted more and loved it.
[02:35:17.683 --> 02:35:20.585]  And I washed my hair with it, the bar soap, the dishwashing soap.
[02:35:20.585 --> 02:35:21.105]  We use it.
[02:35:22.046 --> 02:35:27.868]  And normally you pay more for organic, you pay less for this than organic, and less than the chemical stuff.
[02:35:27.868 --> 02:35:31.189]  See, the chemical plants with all the oil, they have all this byproduct.
[02:35:31.189 --> 02:35:36.191]  So they just put it into this, what you know is detergents and soap, and it really hurts you.
[02:35:36.191 --> 02:35:38.232]  So this is really great stuff, but it's triple concentrated.
[02:35:38.232 --> 02:35:40.132]  Be sure and dilute it.
[02:35:40.132 --> 02:35:43.133]  A lot of people just take it pure and use it.
[02:35:43.133 --> 02:35:45.494]  It's all triple concentrated, that's why it lasts so long.
[02:35:45.494 --> 02:35:50.035]  That's why it's 85% off supermarket prices, and you're not paying for all the additives and fillers.
[02:35:50.035 --> 02:35:51.276]  Marty, good to have you on with us.
[02:35:51.923 --> 02:35:53.084]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:35:53.084 --> 02:35:54.625]  Good to hear from you.
[02:35:54.625 --> 02:35:56.306]  Good to have you with us.
[02:35:56.306 --> 02:36:03.512]  Throw out to folks the tote bag, some of the products, how they get a free brochure, how they order a sampler tote bag.
[02:36:03.512 --> 02:36:09.256]  5starsoap.com is the website, just the number 5 and star soap, or spell it out, 5starsoap.com.
[02:36:09.256 --> 02:36:11.538]  Tell folks just in a nutshell about your fine product.
[02:36:12.125 --> 02:36:16.028]  Well, first I want to say we have a new, improved website.
[02:36:16.028 --> 02:36:20.130]  It's freshly redone and it makes it much more easier to look at.
[02:36:20.130 --> 02:36:24.953]  Same 5starsoap.com, but you'll really enjoy it.
[02:36:24.953 --> 02:36:35.240]  Yeah, I hadn't looked at it in the last week and they just popped it up on screen as we simulcast on prisonplanet.tv and it looked great before, but it really looks Web 2.0 and awesome now.
[02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:36.381]  So that's good news.
[02:36:37.088 --> 02:36:38.409]  Oh yes, we've worked at it.
[02:36:38.409 --> 02:36:43.472]  We want to do it for everybody and we thank for everybody looking at it and enjoying it.
[02:36:43.472 --> 02:36:46.073]  It's something to go forward with.
[02:36:46.073 --> 02:36:47.514]  Like I said, we make soap.
[02:36:47.514 --> 02:36:57.180]  We've been making soap for 62 years, still doing it successfully, enjoying all the radio listeners calling us up with questions.
[02:36:57.180 --> 02:36:59.821]  We've got all the answers, all the help.
[02:36:59.821 --> 02:37:02.843]  We make bar soap, laundry soap,
[02:37:03.735 --> 02:37:04.956]  We're good to go.
[02:37:26.031 --> 02:37:31.574]  We've got bulk packages for large families or people that want to take care of their future.
[02:37:31.574 --> 02:37:34.275]  We go from a 1 to 2 year supply to a 3 to 4 year supply.
[02:37:34.275 --> 02:37:38.237]  And our monster package of 4 to 5 year supply for a family of 4.
[02:37:38.237 --> 02:37:39.618]  That's over 200 pounds of goods.
[02:37:46.673 --> 02:37:48.134]  Keep it on the shelf.
[02:37:48.134 --> 02:37:48.954]  Use it.
[02:37:48.954 --> 02:37:51.176]  It has an unlimited shelf life.
[02:37:51.176 --> 02:37:52.736]  You don't have to worry about that.
[02:37:52.736 --> 02:37:59.360]  But if you want to try the product and really enjoy the future, we have a sample of package.
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:01.561]  We call it a one-month supply.
[02:38:01.561 --> 02:38:03.582]  It weighs out about six pounds.
[02:38:03.582 --> 02:38:07.585]  It'll last a family of four, anywhere from four to eight weeks.
[02:38:07.585 --> 02:38:09.706]  It's got four bars of our pure soap.
[02:38:10.246 --> 02:38:11.867]  Nothing like it anywhere.
[02:38:11.867 --> 02:38:17.988]  18 ounces, a little jar of our triple concentrated laundry soap.
[02:38:17.988 --> 02:38:23.370]  Not detergent soap, but a little tiny measuring scoop.
[02:38:23.370 --> 02:38:28.471]  16 ounces in a dispenser bottle of our triple concentrated cocoa butter shampoo.
[02:38:29.191 --> 02:38:29.912]  We're good.
[02:38:46.193 --> 02:38:47.594]  It'll get you started.
[02:38:47.594 --> 02:38:49.094]  It'll turn you around.
[02:38:49.094 --> 02:38:50.655]  It'll change your life.
[02:38:50.655 --> 02:38:52.115]  It's a pure appointment.
[02:38:52.115 --> 02:38:52.775]  Well, exactly.
[02:38:52.775 --> 02:38:54.736]  I mean, everything with a globalist is a rip-off.
[02:38:54.736 --> 02:38:58.677]  And so you pay for a bunch of chemicals, a bunch of salt, a bunch of crud.
[02:38:58.677 --> 02:39:01.338]  Instead, you save money getting the high-quality organic soap.
[02:39:01.338 --> 02:39:02.619]  It's a great thing to do.
[02:39:02.619 --> 02:39:03.899]  We'll put it back up on screen.
[02:39:03.899 --> 02:39:07.880]  FiveStarSoap.com or CalbinPureSoap.com.
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:09.341]  Either way will get you there.
[02:39:10.001 --> 02:39:10.321]  And it's 800-340-7091.
[02:39:10.321 --> 02:39:10.381]  800-340-7091.
[02:39:10.381 --> 02:39:11.262]  Grab your pen and paper, folks.
[02:39:11.262 --> 02:39:13.164]  You can also get a free brochure by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:39:13.164 --> 02:39:13.824]  Again, that's 800-340-7091.
[02:39:13.824 --> 02:39:16.907]  And, Marty, it's always great having you pop in here on the show.
[02:39:16.907 --> 02:39:18.068]  Give us today's limerick.
[02:39:18.068 --> 02:39:18.788]  A wonderful bird is a birkin.
[02:39:39.372 --> 02:39:42.913]  His bill can hold more than his belly can.
[02:39:42.913 --> 02:39:57.717]  He can hold in his beak enough food for a week, and I wonder how in the hell he can.
[02:39:57.717 --> 02:39:58.797]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:39:58.797 --> 02:40:00.437]  Hey, Marty, great having you.
[02:40:00.437 --> 02:40:02.838]  800-340-7091 or fivestarsoap.com.
[02:40:02.838 --> 02:40:05.859]  Banners up on jonesreport.com and infowars.com.
[02:40:05.859 --> 02:40:06.639]  God bless you, Marty.
[02:40:06.639 --> 02:40:07.399]  Talk to you again soon.
[02:40:07.884 --> 02:40:08.384]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:08.384 --> 02:40:09.265]  Talk to you soon.
[02:40:09.265 --> 02:40:09.745]  Bye now.
[02:40:09.745 --> 02:40:10.385]  There he goes.
[02:40:10.385 --> 02:40:11.406]  What a character.
[02:40:11.406 --> 02:40:15.948]  62 years and counting running Calvin Peirce Soap.
[02:40:15.948 --> 02:40:34.418]  On a lighter note, I want to blitz through calls here with Dan, Alex, Randy, Manette, William, and a few others, but something, you know, I see this stuff everywhere, Steve, and I hope you're wrong, but I understand why you're seeing all this and now you're being followed and all this stuff's going on.
[02:40:34.418 --> 02:40:35.079]  It's happening to me.
[02:40:36.147 --> 02:40:42.080]  And they admit we have army documents that become mainstream news, how Ron Paul and myself are followed by the army.
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:43.122]  You say it's happening to you.
[02:40:43.122 --> 02:40:43.763]  I believe you.
[02:40:46.331 --> 02:40:50.733]  Then I see how they go, oh, the Winter Olympics are coming to Canada, there will be martial law in the city.
[02:40:50.733 --> 02:40:58.636]  You know, that's the headline I saw two days ago on one of their big papers, like it's good, and oh, there will be martial law in England for the Olympics.
[02:40:58.636 --> 02:41:02.517]  You know, they're just, they just say now, no rights, no free to speech.
[02:41:02.517 --> 02:41:07.799]  They say, just like China, you'll be arrested if you even have a sign in your window of your house.
[02:41:07.799 --> 02:41:09.239]  And they're now announcing this for the G20.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:15.143]  In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that's coming up.
[02:41:15.143 --> 02:41:21.546]  We've got somebody inside National City Bank, National City, saying they're closing the branches there.
[02:41:21.546 --> 02:41:24.668]  I mean, this is just getting crazier and crazier, Steve.
[02:41:24.668 --> 02:41:29.851]  So, there's no doubt they're trying to bring in tyranny.
[02:41:29.851 --> 02:41:31.712]  I guess we can just argue about the time frame.
[02:41:32.210 --> 02:41:33.611]  Well, it's not only the time frame.
[02:41:33.611 --> 02:41:35.112]  I'd say this.
[02:41:35.112 --> 02:41:41.115]  I think everybody should forget the time frame in one sense, Alex, from the standpoint of, look what's happening now.
[02:41:41.115 --> 02:41:42.016]  You've been accurate.
[02:41:42.016 --> 02:41:42.716]  I've been accurate.
[02:41:42.716 --> 02:41:43.817]  You've warned about the camps.
[02:41:43.817 --> 02:41:45.538]  I've warned about camps, okay?
[02:41:45.538 --> 02:41:46.418]  They're now being built.
[02:41:46.418 --> 02:41:47.699]  You can go on Google and see them.
[02:41:47.699 --> 02:41:49.340]  You've warned about foreign troops.
[02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:49.760]  You!
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.401]  It rolls back in 2000.
[02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:52.582]  Now they're here en masse.
[02:41:52.582 --> 02:41:56.284]  They're not returning home after the national level exercise.
[02:41:56.284 --> 02:41:57.945]  That's the key, okay?
[02:41:57.945 --> 02:42:00.266]  Before, prior years, they did return home.
[02:42:00.606 --> 02:42:03.529]  You've warned in your endgame video that the Illuminati's plan is for a mass blood sacrifice.
[02:42:03.529 --> 02:42:07.012]  Look, nothing would delight the devil more than 25 to 50 million people butchered in this country.
[02:42:20.836 --> 02:42:25.941]  You know, and again, look it, they're planned, they're out in the media, they control the media.
[02:42:25.941 --> 02:42:30.465]  There is no such thing as truth and fairness, come on.
[02:42:30.465 --> 02:42:39.133]  In the mainstream media, even Glenn Beck and so many of the people that people say, well they're telling the truth, it's not what they say, it's what they're not allowed to say.
[02:42:39.133 --> 02:42:44.578]  And we're actually in a medically declared state of emergency under level 6 of the World Health Organization.
[02:42:45.058 --> 02:42:50.984]  The only logical conclusion, Alex, is now they're going to do what you and I have warned about, and it's hard.
[02:42:50.984 --> 02:42:59.071]  Listen, I understand it's as hard for you and me, having warned about it all these years, to grasp the fact that it's no longer future, it's here.
[02:42:59.071 --> 02:43:01.613]  That's why people need to get their food now.
[02:43:01.613 --> 02:43:03.555]  They need to get whatever they're going to get.
[02:43:03.835 --> 02:43:11.938]  And I tell everybody, and I told some people that came in my store yesterday, if today is the last day that you could go to the store to prepare, how long could you last?
[02:43:11.938 --> 02:43:14.559]  One person said two weeks, one person said two months.
[02:43:14.559 --> 02:43:17.060]  And then they said, but what do we do after that?
[02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:20.121]  I said, after that, the plans are for you to die.
[02:43:20.121 --> 02:43:22.341]  And again, see, this is not warm and fuzzy.
[02:43:22.341 --> 02:43:23.842]  This is not cuddly and cute.
[02:43:24.182 --> 02:43:51.487]  This is reality, and you quote Stalin, the purges of Stalin, Mao, all of the great destruction that has taken place in the history of the world, and people thought coming, and those who could spoke up, but those who were silent, those are the ones that if they weren't killed immediately had to live with the rest of their lives of knowing when they could have done something, they could have said something, they could have stood for anything, they stood for nothing and watched the
[02:43:51.967 --> 02:43:56.631]  And it didn't happen here because we've had guns and have been willing to defend ourselves.
[02:43:56.631 --> 02:43:59.033]  Absolutely, and that's why they're going for the guns.
[02:43:59.033 --> 02:44:01.014]  Look, they wouldn't be GPSing.
[02:44:01.014 --> 02:44:05.518]  When I meet someone from NorthCom and they tell me that... Hold on!
[02:44:05.518 --> 02:44:11.683]  We were telling them they were GPSing for the census and to mark homes for law enforcement before they even admitted it.
[02:44:11.683 --> 02:44:12.543]  Now they admit it.
[02:44:12.543 --> 02:44:12.904]  Go ahead.
[02:44:13.804 --> 02:44:17.186]  And when I have someone who with tears in his eyes who works for the U.S.
[02:44:17.186 --> 02:44:22.769]  military in a command level, basically saying, Steve, they're going to use the air assets of the entire U.S.
[02:44:22.769 --> 02:44:29.292]  Air Force against a citizen, that, and I'm telling you this, Alex, you don't just sit there and go, oh, that's nice, gee, I hope
[02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:30.541]  No, no, no.
[02:44:30.541 --> 02:44:34.124]  Daily Cause said, bragged, we're in control now.
[02:44:34.124 --> 02:44:36.626]  We'll use the Air Force against the American people.
[02:44:36.626 --> 02:44:37.987]  We'll get their guns.
[02:44:37.987 --> 02:44:42.431]  Right, but I said that before that even came out of the Daily Cause, okay?
[02:44:42.431 --> 02:44:43.972]  See, it's not enough.
[02:44:43.972 --> 02:44:44.993]  I don't make this stuff up.
[02:44:44.993 --> 02:44:50.998]  Number one, I don't even know, you know, seriously, if I saw ranks, if I saw enough stars, I'd know it's a general.
[02:44:50.998 --> 02:44:57.624]  But what I'm telling you is when I know people that come in and basically can answer questions that no one can answer except them,
[02:44:58.004 --> 02:45:11.814]  And when they've got tears rolling down their eyes and say, the reason I'm telling you this is because I know that you're trying to save lives, and when I'm being told that they're leaving the military, and I said, you mean like leaving, like, you know, going AWOL?
[02:45:11.814 --> 02:45:21.901]  They said, I'll do whatever I have to do to get back to my family, but I'm not going to take part in the selective, quote his words, carpet bombing of Americans in American cities.
[02:45:21.901 --> 02:45:25.503]  So when I hear of F-16s circling over specific
[02:45:26.344 --> 02:45:36.511]  No, no, we've had Blackhawks, Cobras, Sea Cobras, Chinooks, B-2 Bombers flying over Austin in the last two weeks during NLE09.
[02:45:39.472 --> 02:45:40.513]  Absolutely!
[02:45:40.513 --> 02:45:41.834]  Now they're A-10s and everything.
[02:45:41.834 --> 02:45:48.398]  Look, I was told by a, let's just say that someone who hates my gut, he said, we won't even waste a bullet on you.
[02:45:48.398 --> 02:45:50.099]  You get a hellfire missile.
[02:45:50.099 --> 02:45:53.841]  I said, well you may get your hellfire missile off, pal, but you end up in hell.
[02:45:53.841 --> 02:45:57.583]  And I meant that not as a sarcastic, you know, gee, what's a good comeback.
[02:45:57.583 --> 02:46:02.807]  So the thing that I'm trying to tell you is that what do they do with the Taliban?
[02:46:02.807 --> 02:46:03.207]  Crap!
[02:46:03.527 --> 02:46:08.152]  They'll send a UAV with hellfires against them, so why is it any different?
[02:46:08.152 --> 02:46:09.673]  Why is it any different, Alex?
[02:46:09.673 --> 02:46:10.194]  It isn't.
[02:46:10.194 --> 02:46:21.645]  It's just that we cannot believe, as Americans who have enjoyed the freedom of our God-given rights, and maybe we shouldn't forget Him, that we had something, and because of apathy and difference.
[02:46:21.645 --> 02:46:22.506]  I'm not talking about you.
[02:46:22.506 --> 02:46:25.309]  I'm not talking about me and the others who have carried this fight on for so long.
[02:46:25.669 --> 02:46:36.754]  But because of apathy, indifference, and entertainment, the greatest mind melt, and I could use another word, but I won't, medium that's ever been invented, we have been loathe to sleep.
[02:46:36.754 --> 02:46:41.076]  We are in a state of... Well, bottom line, we've got to wake up or it's going to get worse.
[02:46:41.076 --> 02:46:42.477]  Let's talk to Dan in Texas.
[02:46:42.477 --> 02:46:44.798]  Dan, you're on the air with Steve Quill, SteveQuill.com.
[02:46:44.798 --> 02:46:45.198]  Go ahead.
[02:46:45.198 --> 02:46:47.039]  Steve's right.
[02:46:48.086 --> 02:46:49.407]  Created in a lab.
[02:46:49.407 --> 02:46:51.188]  I think Gardasil's Ebola.
[02:46:51.188 --> 02:46:52.149]  It has all the symptoms.
[02:46:52.149 --> 02:46:55.132]  A rash, red eyes, hiccups, internal, external bleeding.
[02:46:55.132 --> 02:46:56.913]  A rash develops on dark skin.
[02:46:56.913 --> 02:46:58.174]  It's unrecognized.
[02:46:58.174 --> 02:47:01.256]  In pregnant women, it leads to heavy vaginal bleeding.
[02:47:01.256 --> 02:47:03.198]  And that's all common Ebola symptoms.
[02:47:03.198 --> 02:47:08.862]  The first person to ever get Ebola was in Zaire, Mobella, Lokella in 1976.
[02:47:08.862 --> 02:47:12.585]  Yeah, right outside a bioweapons lab, yeah.
[02:47:12.585 --> 02:47:15.648]  Yeah, he got injected with what was supposed to be quinine.
[02:47:16.232 --> 02:47:18.513]  And then most of the women in his family died soon after.
[02:47:18.513 --> 02:47:20.414]  Notice they have new outbreaks in the U.S.
[02:47:20.414 --> 02:47:24.756]  and Iraq of troops after they get vaccinated, just like the 76 vaccine.
[02:47:24.756 --> 02:47:25.116]  Go ahead.
[02:47:25.116 --> 02:47:28.657]  So, my suggestion is that Steve's right.
[02:47:28.657 --> 02:47:30.418]  They've already tested it with Gardasil.
[02:47:30.418 --> 02:47:32.619]  They know people will line up and just take this stuff.
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:35.121]  So it's going to be easy for them to scare it.
[02:47:35.121 --> 02:47:37.543]  They'll just repackage it into the H1N1.
[02:47:37.543 --> 02:47:45.247]  The labs that can actually see the viruses have very expensive microscopes, and they're all under heavy control by the military or the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:47:45.247 --> 02:47:50.790]  Well, those that aren't are coming out mainstream news freaking out, going, this is some kind of bioweapon.
[02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:56.473]  I mean, I've got major German news saying it's got cancer viruses in it and asking, why is this in here?
[02:47:56.473 --> 02:47:59.135]  And they're just going, we're the eugenicists.
[02:47:59.135 --> 02:48:00.316]  Shut up.
[02:48:00.316 --> 02:48:01.556]  We love you.
[02:48:03.037 --> 02:48:08.159]  I mean, it's just so sick, the stuff they write and talk about.
[02:48:08.159 --> 02:48:25.467]  Well, again, they're going to try and do that, and I'm saying that there's going to be infighting and double-crossing and triple-crossing, betrayal, counter-force war, war within the intelligence community, specific agencies against each other.
[02:48:25.467 --> 02:48:31.069]  By the way, they're killing each other up right and left right now, and for those of you that doubt that, just remember Roland Carnaby and the
[02:48:31.569 --> 02:48:33.990]  Well, why do you think it's coming out on Blackwater now?
[02:48:33.990 --> 02:48:44.974]  We knew about the slave rings with little kids and the sex parties and the wife swapping and how, you know, how the mercs were shipping in weapon systems to sell to the resistance to even have a fake war.
[02:48:44.974 --> 02:48:47.034]  Now it's in federal filings.
[02:48:47.034 --> 02:48:49.215]  This isn't just coming out for no reason.
[02:48:49.215 --> 02:48:51.716]  There is war going on within the New World Order.
[02:48:52.551 --> 02:49:13.222]  Absolutely, and the head of Blackwater, which is now called ZXE, he stepped down and obviously they're coming after him for being involved in murder, but the thing is that obviously when the Illuminati or Elite turn on their own, it's usually based on a change of heart, and I hope that's
[02:49:14.278 --> 02:49:18.400]  Well, that's what happened when Lenin went to Stalin, they had a big blood feast.
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:35.869]  When Hitler got rid of the SA right when he really got power on February 27, 1933 after he Reichstag, seven months into office, whenever they run these ops, or a few months into office, excuse me, whenever they run these ops, well, you're saying it shows a change of heart.
[02:49:35.869 --> 02:49:42.232]  I've seen that a lot of times be a jump point when they're really getting ready to really start slaughtering, they first kill their own people.
[02:49:42.232 --> 02:49:43.733]  Wait, you're saying it could be good news?
[02:49:44.517 --> 02:49:55.141]  That could be it, too, because, look, if they're hanging him out to dry and they're throwing him to the wolves, it's either for something he knows, something he's done, or something he won't do.
[02:49:55.141 --> 02:49:55.841]  Think about that.
[02:49:55.841 --> 02:49:59.422]  Something he knows, something he's done, or something he won't do.
[02:49:59.422 --> 02:50:04.764]  And I don't know the man, so I can't go beyond, you know, just the stories I've read, but I will tell you this.
[02:50:04.764 --> 02:50:08.986]  That's a huge red flag right there.
[02:50:11.138 --> 02:50:11.899]  Amazing.
[02:50:11.899 --> 02:50:12.400]  Okay.
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:13.441]  Thank you, Dan.
[02:50:13.441 --> 02:50:15.624]  Alex in Maryland will start your call and hold you over.
[02:50:15.624 --> 02:50:17.227]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:50:17.227 --> 02:50:17.727]  Hello.
[02:50:17.727 --> 02:50:18.288]  Hey, Alex.
[02:50:18.288 --> 02:50:18.648]  How you doing?
[02:50:18.648 --> 02:50:19.530]  How you doing, Steve?
[02:50:19.530 --> 02:50:19.670]  Good.
[02:50:21.095 --> 02:50:23.797]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, Alex, keep doing what you're doing, man.
[02:50:23.797 --> 02:50:24.998]  You woke me up this year, man.
[02:50:24.998 --> 02:50:28.540]  I always knew something was fishy and going on, but you woke me up this year.
[02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:31.561]  I just got a quick question and a comment as well.
[02:50:31.561 --> 02:50:33.583]  One, I wanted to let you know, I live real close.
[02:50:33.583 --> 02:50:37.305]  I live about six miles away from the Capitol, right here in Maryland.
[02:50:37.305 --> 02:50:42.728]  And about every two weeks or so, you've got officers patrolling the area in my neighborhood.
[02:50:42.728 --> 02:50:47.471]  It's a housing neighborhood, around 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock, roaming around.
[02:50:48.777 --> 02:51:00.423]  And, uh, I wanted to say also, uh, do you think, in case we do go to war, if things really hit the fan, that the military start using, uh, people who are in prison just like they did in Vietnam?

[02:52:03.114 --> 02:52:05.915]  A New World Order.
[02:52:05.915 --> 02:52:10.818]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:52:10.818 --> 02:52:13.639]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:52:13.639 --> 02:52:16.440]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:19.622]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:52:19.622 --> 02:52:26.946]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:52:29.943 --> 02:52:35.407]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:52:35.407 --> 02:52:39.269]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:52:39.269 --> 02:52:41.851]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:52:41.851 --> 02:52:43.012]  Most people have no idea.
[02:52:43.012 --> 02:52:43.792]  They're not after money.
[02:52:43.792 --> 02:52:45.073]  They have all the money they need.
[02:52:45.073 --> 02:52:46.054]  They're after power.
[02:52:46.054 --> 02:52:47.195]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:52:58.722 --> 02:52:59.803]  You have been warned.
[02:53:00.844 --> 02:53:09.910]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.

[02:54:22.202 --> 02:54:28.703]  In the next segment, before Daryl Rundis joins us, we've got the gentleman on who had the gun a few blocks away from where Obama was at.
[02:54:28.703 --> 02:54:30.604]  The media made a big deal out of that.
[02:54:30.604 --> 02:54:33.224]  He's joining us at the end of the show today.
[02:54:33.224 --> 02:54:46.587]  WESHTV is reporting that people were saying it was a hate crime, a Nazi crime, to put up Obama posters in public places that said New World Order.
[02:54:46.587 --> 02:54:50.368]  Back there, and the police are saying it is not considered a hate crime.
[02:54:51.291 --> 02:54:57.719]  But see, they say under federal rules now they're trying to pass in the House that hurting feelings is a hate crime.
[02:54:57.719 --> 02:54:59.681]  This is nuts!
[02:54:59.681 --> 02:55:05.228]  And we've said from day one, post these in public commons where other posters are posted.
[02:55:05.228 --> 02:55:09.453]  Do not post it on, you know, post offices or government things.
[02:55:11.772 --> 02:55:14.314]  I mean, there's a pole out front of a government building.
[02:55:14.314 --> 02:55:14.835]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:55:14.835 --> 02:55:16.877]  People put stuff on those all the time.
[02:55:16.877 --> 02:55:20.280]  You know, they're telling us everywhere we can't go out and speech and have demonstrations.
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:22.482]  We have to stand up for our free speech.
[02:55:22.482 --> 02:55:24.604]  But, you know, now I'm some evil hate criminal.
[02:55:24.604 --> 02:55:25.905]  That's coming up.
[02:55:25.905 --> 02:55:31.170]  Yes, to answer the caller's question, they are hiring criminals for the military.
[02:55:32.421 --> 02:55:33.703]  They are hiring felons.
[02:55:33.703 --> 02:55:34.985]  They are hiring illegal aliens.
[02:55:34.985 --> 02:55:37.249]  And even police agencies are now.
[02:55:37.249 --> 02:55:38.390]  And that's mainstream news.
[02:55:38.390 --> 02:55:39.672]  You can just search engine.
[02:55:39.672 --> 02:55:41.716]  Startpage.com is a good search engine.
[02:55:41.716 --> 02:55:44.219]  You can just search that out and see that for yourself.
[02:55:44.219 --> 02:55:45.642]  Steve Quayle comments on that front.
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:58.971]  We're going to see the enlisting of all sorts of, quote-unquote, what society would call undesirables, not my term, theirs, to enlist in this war against us.
[02:55:58.971 --> 02:56:08.660]  Listen, Alex, when the Chinese were bringing in weapons almost ten years ago to the different gangs, the different groups, and the entire West Coast, we were reporting on that.
[02:56:08.660 --> 02:56:11.123]  There were stories in the, excuse me,
[02:56:11.523 --> 02:56:16.265]  Mainstream press about it, and people say, well, I hope that doesn't mean what I think it means.
[02:56:16.265 --> 02:56:17.685]  It means exactly what it is.
[02:56:17.685 --> 02:56:27.508]  Listen, I've interviewed gang members, I've interviewed revolutionaries over the years, being on talk radio, and they all say, we know what's coming, and they don't plan on giving up their guns.
[02:56:27.508 --> 02:56:37.511]  So the point is that it's going to be total chaos, and this is absolutely necessity under the Communist Manifesto, but more so under the New World Orders doctrine.
[02:56:37.791 --> 02:56:38.151]  Absolutely.
[02:56:38.151 --> 02:56:45.615]  You know, I just can't believe the public thinks it's illegal to put a poster up on a light pole where everybody else puts posters up.
[02:56:45.615 --> 02:56:48.636]  I mean, they don't freak out when it's a lost dog or a pro-Obama poster.
[02:56:48.636 --> 02:56:49.456]  Look, I have the President
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:28.640]  saying put these on put his on stop signs now I told people don't put them on stop signs but see it's okay for Obama on his letterhead show people this is this made national news it's okay he says put it on put it on state and property I'm saying don't do that but he's okay but then you put it on
[02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:35.183]  You know, some type of thing downtown where other posters are, you're supposedly evil.
[02:57:35.183 --> 02:57:36.564]  These people are sick.
[02:57:36.564 --> 02:57:38.705]  But just like you said, Steve, it's two different rules.
[02:57:38.705 --> 02:57:40.986]  They have two different systems.
[02:57:40.986 --> 02:57:44.168]  It's them versus us, and that's what's obvious.
[02:57:44.168 --> 02:57:46.230]  And now, let me tell you something.
[02:57:46.230 --> 02:57:48.551]  More protests are going to feel more threatened.
[02:57:48.551 --> 02:57:54.275]  More threats are going to feel more laws, or they're going to feel more laws against America being able to express
[02:57:54.992 --> 02:57:56.153]  Well, that's why I did this.
[02:57:56.153 --> 02:58:01.877]  A week and a half ago, I saw them demonizing whoever put a few of these up in LA and the media was saying, should they be allowed?
[02:58:01.877 --> 02:58:02.698]  Is it okay?
[02:58:02.698 --> 02:58:03.858]  Is it racist?
[02:58:03.858 --> 02:58:07.241]  And I went, they made Bush the Joker and I supported that.
[02:58:07.241 --> 02:58:09.322]  We even posted it on our website.
[02:58:09.322 --> 02:58:13.806]  I said, so I said, everybody, I'm going to make t-shirts, which we now have available for sale.
[02:58:13.806 --> 02:58:15.167]  Next, they'll say you can't wear this.
[02:58:15.167 --> 02:58:19.110]  And we got them in black and white and different messages on them at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:22.011]  Steve Quayle, do one more minute with us on the other side.
[02:58:22.011 --> 02:58:25.253]  I want to plug your website, your books, your materials, all very informative.
[02:58:25.253 --> 02:58:31.216]  I know you're so concerned about what's happening, you're not even plugging them these days, but people still need to get them and read them.
[02:58:31.216 --> 02:58:36.579]  SteveQuayle.com, my website's InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:36.579 --> 02:58:42.643]  The Joker contest has gone ultra-megaviral!
[02:58:42.643 --> 02:58:46.185]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.185 --> 02:58:48.066]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.879 --> 02:58:52.261]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.261 --> 02:58:54.263]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:58:54.263 --> 02:58:54.884]  Well, you should.
[02:58:54.884 --> 02:58:59.729]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:58:59.729 --> 02:59:00.530]  That's right.
[02:59:00.530 --> 02:59:09.200]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:10.561]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[02:59:10.561 --> 02:59:11.703]  Plus, if you act fast.
[02:59:11.903 --> 02:59:17.888]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:59:17.888 --> 02:59:24.773]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:59:24.773 --> 02:59:30.297]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:59:30.297 --> 02:59:31.758]  This is real.
[02:59:31.758 --> 02:59:32.819]  Don't miss out.
[02:59:32.819 --> 02:59:39.684]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[02:59:39.924 --> 02:59:41.365]  And get your free handgun.
[02:59:41.365 --> 02:59:43.726]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[02:59:43.726 --> 02:59:47.427]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[02:59:47.427 --> 02:59:54.110]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[02:59:54.110 --> 02:59:56.492]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.492 --> 02:59:59.313]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:29.121 --> 03:00:32.964]  All right, we are into the fourth and final hour today.
[03:00:32.964 --> 03:00:37.087]  Steve Quayle joined us to break down the whole flu situation.
[03:00:37.087 --> 03:00:42.591]  I see that as the only card they've got to really be able to say the general public's the enemy.
[03:00:42.591 --> 03:00:44.833]  Their pretext of fear and hysteria.
[03:00:44.833 --> 03:00:46.034]  That's the best card they've got.
[03:00:46.034 --> 03:00:47.495]  They've got some other cards they can play.
[03:00:48.295 --> 03:00:52.761]  State's terror saying conservatives did it, saying anti-new order people did it.
[03:00:52.761 --> 03:00:59.790]  We now see the Southern Poverty Law Center and others coming out pre-hyping that, so that really increases the danger of that.
[03:00:59.790 --> 03:01:02.433]  But does virus increase the risk of cancer?
[03:01:02.433 --> 03:01:03.494]  Live cancer viruses.
[03:01:03.494 --> 03:01:04.816]  We'll go over more of this.
[03:01:04.816 --> 03:01:06.018]  Dr. Darrell Rund is coming up.
[03:01:06.018 --> 03:01:06.698]  A ton of other
[03:01:07.519 --> 03:01:10.702]  News as things accelerate and just get crazier and crazier.
[03:01:10.702 --> 03:01:18.488]  I want to commend all the video entries of folks out at public places where other posters are being posted, other handbills are being posted.
[03:01:18.488 --> 03:01:22.771]  Be sure you follow the rules to do that, but I can only say great job to everybody.
[03:01:22.771 --> 03:01:25.093]  This is a great exercise in the First Amendment.
[03:01:25.093 --> 03:01:30.097]  Steve, in closing, why do you think this Joker image scares them so much?
[03:01:30.097 --> 03:01:34.280]  A. B. Tell us about some of the great books and things you've written.
[03:01:36.155 --> 03:01:36.675]  We're good.
[03:01:52.908 --> 03:01:57.712]  My book that's really critical for the end times is Breathe No Evil.
[03:01:57.712 --> 03:01:59.714]  It was written almost a decade ago.
[03:01:59.714 --> 03:02:09.242]  My Genetic Armageddon book talks about what's going on and actually took into account all of the biological brew that would be unleashed upon us.
[03:02:10.203 --> 03:02:13.265]  Obviously, Genesis, Six Giants, which is the classic.
[03:02:13.265 --> 03:02:19.009]  And I think, Alex, the thing that people need to understand is that we are running out of time.
[03:02:19.009 --> 03:02:29.055]  In my perspective, they had better recognize that there comes a day when the powers that be shut the internet off, shut down the communications, shut down the power, shut down everything.
[03:02:29.475 --> 03:02:36.917]  And then they're only going to be left to what they know and what they've been trained by before, or the knowledge that you, I, and others have given them.
[03:02:36.917 --> 03:02:44.720]  Those people needing survival skills, you need to go to survivalblog.com, the best website of its kind in the world.
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:50.622]  Those who need a preparedness manual to get caught up to speed, Holly Dale, dare to prepare them by the way she's sending.
[03:02:51.222 --> 03:02:52.925]  You a couple of those, Alex.
[03:02:52.925 --> 03:03:00.154]  The biggest, best book for preparation that's ever been done, Dare to Prepare, by Stan and Holly Dale, D-D-Y-O.
[03:03:00.154 --> 03:03:05.440]  So I just want to thank you for the time, and Alex, I say this not as anything other than thank you.
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:07.343]  I do pray for you, your family's safety.
[03:03:07.703 --> 03:03:13.870]  But as far as I know, and I have this sense, our days of speaking are very limited.
[03:03:13.870 --> 03:03:19.076]  It's not because of what we would or not do, it's what they intend to do and shut us down.
[03:03:19.076 --> 03:03:27.886]  And the full court presses on, and people had better get close to the living God, they'd better repent, they'd better understand that the one who laid all these events out for us
[03:03:28.306 --> 03:03:30.187]  In the beginning was Jesus.
[03:03:30.187 --> 03:03:32.287]  He said it's going to happen, and it's going to happen.
[03:03:32.287 --> 03:03:34.508]  The question is, can we stop it?
[03:03:34.508 --> 03:03:43.930]  Every day we have another day of giving more information, of preparing another individual, another group, or another country around the world.
[03:03:43.930 --> 03:03:45.990]  We go worldwide, as you know.
[03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:47.471]  That's what I thank God for.
[03:03:47.471 --> 03:03:52.872]  Moments of mercy, because very soon the moments of mercy will give way to the moments of madness.
[03:03:53.263 --> 03:03:54.644]  Well, I hope that's not the case.
[03:03:54.644 --> 03:03:55.705]  We're working to stop that.
[03:03:55.705 --> 03:04:00.648]  But why do you think this Joker poster in the last minute has concerned the elitists so much?
[03:04:00.648 --> 03:04:17.700]  Because the Joker poster is emblematic of evil in the last, uh, the Heath Ledger portrayal of the Joker in the last Batman was probably one of the most brilliant portrayals by an actor of sinister evil coupled with sort of a funny face.
[03:04:17.700 --> 03:04:19.502]  That's what's getting to the elite.
[03:04:19.502 --> 03:04:22.684]  The elite, no, they've used every form of symbol
[03:04:23.104 --> 03:04:34.672]  They've used every form of subconscious portrayal in all their media, what I call, vomit presentations, and now it's because it's being turned back on them, Alex.
[03:04:34.672 --> 03:04:37.734]  They don't like it when they get a taste of their own medicine.
[03:04:37.734 --> 03:04:45.599]  It's taking their archetype and defiling their god, their frontman, Barack Obama, and that's why we're selling the t-shirt, available at InfoWars.com.
[03:04:45.599 --> 03:04:47.380]  Don't let them chill your free speech.
[03:04:47.380 --> 03:04:50.723]  Wear it proudly in public, or we lose the First Amendment.
[03:04:50.723 --> 03:04:52.624]  Steve Quayle, thanks for all the info.
[03:04:53.024 --> 03:04:54.185]  Thanks Alex, buh-bye.
[03:04:54.185 --> 03:04:54.665]  God bless.
[03:04:54.665 --> 03:04:58.508]  Steve Quill dot com, OurSitesInfoWars dot com, PrisonPlanet dot TV.
[03:04:58.508 --> 03:05:00.110]  They'll run us straight ahead.
[03:05:00.110 --> 03:05:01.271]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.271 --> 03:05:06.475]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:05:06.475 --> 03:05:10.238]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:10.498 --> 03:05:11.178]  Number 2.
[03:05:11.178 --> 03:05:16.401]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:16.401 --> 03:05:17.042]  It's true.
[03:05:17.042 --> 03:05:21.464]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.464 --> 03:05:22.385]  Number 3.
[03:05:22.385 --> 03:05:28.008]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:05:28.008 --> 03:05:28.669]  Number 4.
[03:05:28.669 --> 03:05:31.570]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:05:31.570 --> 03:05:35.232]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:35.232 --> 03:05:36.093]  Number 5.
[03:05:36.093 --> 03:05:39.715]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:05:39.935 --> 03:05:45.679]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:05:45.679 --> 03:05:50.363]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:50.363 --> 03:05:52.144]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:52.144 --> 03:05:54.706]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[03:05:54.706 --> 03:05:57.348]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[03:06:01.547 --> 03:06:04.549]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.549 --> 03:06:09.874]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.874 --> 03:06:11.935]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.935 --> 03:06:16.939]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.939 --> 03:06:17.860]  How much do you want?
[03:06:18.100 --> 03:06:19.241]  When do you want it?
[03:06:19.241 --> 03:06:21.123]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:21.123 --> 03:06:22.183]  When will you need it?
[03:06:22.183 --> 03:06:24.385]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.385 --> 03:06:25.726]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.726 --> 03:06:27.268]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:27.268 --> 03:06:32.532]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.532 --> 03:06:36.115]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:36.115 --> 03:06:39.578]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.918 --> 03:06:41.159]  How much will you need?
[03:06:41.159 --> 03:06:42.060]  We don't know.
[03:06:42.060 --> 03:06:43.161]  How much do you want?
[03:06:43.161 --> 03:06:44.082]  All you can get.
[03:06:44.082 --> 03:06:45.183]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.183 --> 03:06:48.246]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:48.246 --> 03:06:50.008]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:50.008 --> 03:06:50.928]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:01.032 --> 03:07:10.175]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[03:07:10.175 --> 03:07:18.177]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[03:07:18.717 --> 03:07:22.920]  And clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[03:07:22.920 --> 03:07:25.683]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[03:07:25.683 --> 03:07:37.252]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[03:07:37.252 --> 03:07:43.677]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[03:07:43.677 --> 03:07:47.420]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an
[03:07:47.620 --> 03:07:51.582]  Excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[03:07:51.582 --> 03:07:54.503]  Order some today at FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[03:07:54.503 --> 03:07:56.844]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com.
[03:07:56.844 --> 03:07:58.405]  Or call 888-949-3570.
[03:07:58.405 --> 03:08:09.370]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.370 --> 03:08:12.351]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:19.693 --> 03:08:21.254]  We have found it!
[03:08:21.254 --> 03:08:23.035]  We have found it!
[03:08:23.035 --> 03:08:27.117]  And it's going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com by the end of the show.
[03:08:27.117 --> 03:08:37.002]  The Washington Post with Obama telling his people to take the images of him with hope and change and put it on stop signs in government buildings.
[03:08:37.002 --> 03:08:38.683]  Now, we're not saying that.
[03:08:38.683 --> 03:08:42.485]  We're saying put it where it's legal and lawful in your area.
[03:08:42.485 --> 03:08:44.166]  You know, where people put posters up.
[03:08:44.166 --> 03:08:45.367]  Which is all over downtown.
[03:08:45.367 --> 03:08:47.308]  You see posters, put it up there.
[03:08:47.308 --> 03:08:48.729]  So they can't say you've done something wrong.
[03:08:49.761 --> 03:08:58.748]  They're on the news saying you can't put it on a power pole and that we're criminals, hate criminals, that it's racial.
[03:08:58.748 --> 03:09:00.389]  But the Cato Institute's defending us.
[03:09:00.389 --> 03:09:03.952]  Sorry, not every criticism of Obama is racist.
[03:09:03.952 --> 03:09:05.213]  And they go over it.
[03:09:05.213 --> 03:09:09.756]  But, man, they are really coming after us and they are scared of this.
[03:09:09.756 --> 03:09:12.979]  So put more of the posters up, but don't put them up on private property.
[03:09:14.565 --> 03:09:22.046]  Put them up where you, you know, like in downtown areas or bulletin boards or like, you know, you always see the abandoned buildings that have just all over them.
[03:09:22.046 --> 03:09:24.947]  People are doing that there, but I guess they may selectively enforce.
[03:09:24.947 --> 03:09:31.588]  There could be ads for furniture and ads for lost dogs and ads for the local hamburger place.
[03:09:31.588 --> 03:09:37.629]  I guess we just give in and say, okay, we're going to let you selectively tell us we can't put the posters up.
[03:09:37.629 --> 03:09:41.790]  But Obama can be in the Washington Post and tell everybody to put his up.
[03:09:41.790 --> 03:09:43.530]  Now, YouTube's censoring us.
[03:09:44.730 --> 03:09:58.896]  YouTube took down two of my videos, not me joking around like the Joker to promote this contest, that's why I did that, but serious ones where I said, it isn't about Obama, it isn't about Bush, they're puppets, let's come together against the New World Order.
[03:09:58.896 --> 03:10:01.957]  Obama's really a fascist, but he's just a front.
[03:10:01.957 --> 03:10:07.620]  The posters aren't racist, they're removing those, because they don't want us to come together.
[03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:12.022]  And I remember a few months ago talking to Daryl Rundas, who's done a lot of big successful things in the past,
[03:10:13.012 --> 03:10:18.677]  I said, well he said, I'm going to start something for the people's own YouTube.
[03:10:18.677 --> 03:10:25.784]  And, you know, there's a lot of other video sites out there, but this is going to be one where YouDoNews.com couldn't beat the URL.
[03:10:25.784 --> 03:10:26.785]  He said it was just available.
[03:10:26.785 --> 03:10:28.606]  Wow, that's providence.
[03:10:28.606 --> 03:10:33.311]  Just you, the letter U, DoNews.com, and there it is.
[03:10:33.311 --> 03:10:34.832]  It says, coming soon, Daryl.
[03:10:34.832 --> 03:10:38.656]  I would imagine we need to have you up for a main interview when it's ready to go.
[03:10:39.315 --> 03:10:45.385]  Well we should be ready to release, or should I say unleash, this on the public Monday.
[03:10:45.385 --> 03:10:48.790]  So hopefully we can get down to Austin.
[03:10:48.790 --> 03:10:51.114]  Forgive me for not getting in the studio today.
[03:10:51.954 --> 03:10:54.015]  Well, that's fine, but we want to have you when you officially launch it.
[03:10:54.015 --> 03:10:57.356]  So, in the next few weeks, once it's up and going, we'll get it up.
[03:10:57.356 --> 03:10:58.656]  But tell us about UDO News.
[03:10:58.656 --> 03:11:05.258]  Well, first off, what do you think about Obama's in the Washington Post saying, put my image up on stop signs.
[03:11:05.258 --> 03:11:07.619]  That's a quote, and I have his official White House letter.
[03:11:07.619 --> 03:11:11.720]  But then, my listeners aren't allowed to put them on PowerPulse.
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:17.682]  Well, that, among many, many other selective prosecution or selective
[03:11:18.792 --> 03:11:20.453]  Constitutional enforcement.
[03:11:20.453 --> 03:11:22.333]  You know, it's good for them, but it's not good for us.
[03:11:22.333 --> 03:11:31.597]  In fact, the one question I'd be asking all these politicians at these town halls is, if this health care is so good, why aren't you doing it?
[03:11:31.597 --> 03:11:33.858]  You know, if it's good for you, then I'll do it too.
[03:11:33.858 --> 03:11:35.358]  So I'll do it if you do it.
[03:11:35.358 --> 03:11:37.679]  Everybody believes in the golden rule, right?
[03:11:37.679 --> 03:11:39.420]  Do unto others as you have them do to you.
[03:11:39.420 --> 03:11:42.081]  Even people who don't believe in God believe in the golden rule.
[03:11:42.081 --> 03:11:44.241]  So if it's good for us, it should be good for them.
[03:11:44.241 --> 03:11:45.402]  Let them go first.
[03:11:45.402 --> 03:11:45.742]  What do you think?
[03:11:47.401 --> 03:11:54.227]  Well I agree with you, and I want to get into some more of those issues, but Daryl, tell us about what YouDoNews.com is going to look like.
[03:11:54.227 --> 03:11:55.308]  What's going to be happening?
[03:11:55.308 --> 03:11:56.509]  What it's going to look like?
[03:11:56.509 --> 03:11:57.670]  Let me tell you what it's going to be.
[03:11:58.413 --> 03:12:01.596]  See, I don't want this to just be some new, cool website.
[03:12:01.596 --> 03:12:02.957]  Sure, it's going to be like YouTube.
[03:12:02.957 --> 03:12:04.218]  You can upload videos.
[03:12:04.218 --> 03:12:05.800]  You can also upload audio.
[03:12:05.800 --> 03:12:17.130]  So you can record conversations with your politicians or your tax collector when they're railroading you, and you can post them into your own blog on our website, import the audio, and do a story that wraps around that audio.
[03:12:17.130 --> 03:12:22.555]  So we're going to have a lot of different media available to people to, you know, for the news they do.
[03:12:22.555 --> 03:12:23.216]  But let me tell you,
[03:12:23.656 --> 03:12:26.678]  What's really my hope and my prayer for this thing, okay?
[03:12:26.678 --> 03:12:29.040]  Because I'm not in this for the money, you know that.
[03:12:29.040 --> 03:12:35.064]  What makes this different than YouTube is the fact that we're going to pay you for the news you do.
[03:12:35.064 --> 03:12:45.492]  So you can continue to just let your news get tossed down the tube, or you can go to YouDoNews, post your information, post your story, and we're going to pay you for the news you do.
[03:12:47.244 --> 03:12:48.464]  Well, that's a great idea.
[03:12:48.464 --> 03:12:50.805]  And we do need more alternatives.
[03:12:50.805 --> 03:12:51.845]  I think it's a great name.
[03:12:51.845 --> 03:12:53.166]  It's going to have a lot of different functions.
[03:12:53.166 --> 03:12:54.926]  I know you've got some great IT people.
[03:12:54.926 --> 03:12:57.107]  So we should see this launch next Monday.
[03:12:57.107 --> 03:13:00.687]  I can go to YouDoNews.com and start uploading videos?
[03:13:00.687 --> 03:13:01.168]  Absolutely.
[03:13:01.168 --> 03:13:03.488]  In fact, let me just give you an example, Alex.
[03:13:03.488 --> 03:13:06.209]  I googled your name on YouTube, okay?
[03:13:06.209 --> 03:13:11.230]  You've got a video here that you, I guess, produced 2.7 million views.
[03:13:11.230 --> 03:13:12.491]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:13:12.491 --> 03:13:14.311]  How much money did YouTube pay you?
[03:13:15.956 --> 03:13:17.217]  Uh, they paid me zero.
[03:13:17.217 --> 03:13:19.159]  They selectively will do it with some people.
[03:13:19.159 --> 03:13:23.463]  We asked and they said, no, we don't want to be an affiliate with you.
[03:13:23.463 --> 03:13:32.831]  And, uh, I've been told that I got videos with over 3 million, 4 million, 5 million views actually on there, that, that a regular person who they do do a deal with would probably be paid about $50,000 for that.
[03:13:34.332 --> 03:13:34.932]  That's right.
[03:13:34.932 --> 03:13:43.735]  So, you know, we want this to be more than what... No, no, YouTube makes money off me, but then still erases what they don't like.
[03:13:43.735 --> 03:13:46.896]  They're doing me a favor, but they actually want us there.
[03:13:46.896 --> 03:13:50.737]  No, they're making money off the masses, so you listen close, America.
[03:13:50.737 --> 03:13:51.098]  Okay?
[03:13:51.098 --> 03:13:52.118]  Look, I've already made my money.
[03:13:52.678 --> 03:13:59.441]  I'm doing this to create a community, an internet community that's certainly of, by, and for the people, okay?
[03:13:59.441 --> 03:14:01.381]  This is your website.
[03:14:01.381 --> 03:14:09.605]  This is going to be a community of independent news journalists who get up, get out, they grab their camera, they grab their cell phone, their recorders, and they start doing news.
[03:14:09.605 --> 03:14:20.929]  Because, as Judge Napolitano said at the Tea Party in Ohio, there is nothing, nothing the government hates more than for us to expose the deeds they do in darkness
[03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:22.270]  With light.
[03:14:22.270 --> 03:14:23.291]  The light of the camera.
[03:14:23.291 --> 03:14:26.512]  He says the camera is the new gun.
[03:14:26.512 --> 03:14:27.512]  And I agree with him.
[03:14:27.512 --> 03:14:29.572]  I think that's what's my passion now.
[03:14:29.572 --> 03:14:31.193]  It's why I'm doing this whole thing.
[03:14:31.193 --> 03:14:32.453]  And once again, it's not about me.
[03:14:32.453 --> 03:14:34.994]  This is all about the news you do.
[03:14:34.994 --> 03:14:35.994]  So here's how it's going to work.
[03:14:35.994 --> 03:14:39.916]  Let me just spell it out for America so they really get this, Alex.
[03:14:39.916 --> 03:14:47.718]  We, every single quarter, when we get out of beta testing, which should be about January, every quarter we're going to pay out 20% of our ad revenue.
[03:14:48.266 --> 03:14:52.867]  And we're going to distribute that ad revenue, that 20%, to everybody.
[03:14:52.867 --> 03:14:55.368]  I don't care how long you've been a reporter with U2 News.
[03:14:55.368 --> 03:14:57.488]  I don't care what content you produce.
[03:14:57.488 --> 03:15:01.569]  As long as it's your content, it's original content, you produce that news.
[03:15:01.569 --> 03:15:06.310]  You can take news clips from Fox, do commentary on it, news review is what we call that.
[03:15:06.310 --> 03:15:11.652]  Whatever it is, it's got to be creative, it's got to be original, it's got to be factual, it's got to be good, hard-hitting news.
[03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:21.083]  At the end of that quarter, if you got, let's say Alex, 10% of the total views on our website, you'd get 10% of that ad revenue.
[03:15:31.485 --> 03:15:34.747]  Or the energy to try to raise the money to do something like that.
[03:15:34.747 --> 03:15:44.751]  So I'm glad you've got it, Daryl, because for those that don't know, for us, when we have a video that gets like 30, 40,000 views, we've had Google erase our flu emergency report.
[03:15:44.751 --> 03:15:51.835]  We posted it, and I forget, it was like 40, 50,000 views in a couple days, and that was a couple thousand dollars for me to have to pay.
[03:15:51.835 --> 03:15:57.057]  And we've got pretty good pricing on bulk bandwidth.
[03:15:57.057 --> 03:16:00.279]  We're using, what is it, 100 terabytes a month now or something?
[03:16:01.240 --> 03:16:02.421]  In between everything or more?
[03:16:02.421 --> 03:16:04.743]  Yeah.
[03:16:04.743 --> 03:16:07.866]  75 terabytes, but we've got 100, so if we go up to 100, then that was not what I was told.
[03:16:07.866 --> 03:16:23.361]  Well, believe me, Alex, I have counted the cost, and I'm willing to roll at minimum a million of my own dollars into this, okay, before I ever even think about breaking even, in order to create the platform for the people to share the news that everyone in the world needs to know.
[03:16:23.561 --> 03:16:24.342]  Well that's good Daryl.
[03:16:24.342 --> 03:16:25.824]  I should talk to you behind the scenes.
[03:16:25.824 --> 03:16:27.967]  I want to make sure you're getting the best price on bandwidth.
[03:16:27.967 --> 03:16:30.450]  I mean, are you using big CDNs?
[03:16:30.450 --> 03:16:32.132]  Yeah, that's the only delay.
[03:16:32.132 --> 03:16:33.594]  We'd be rolling hot right now.
[03:16:33.594 --> 03:16:34.695]  We'd be going live right now.
[03:16:34.695 --> 03:16:38.480]  But I want to make sure all the CDNs are in place so that if they hack us,
[03:16:38.940 --> 03:16:45.123]  Or, if we get an abundance of views all at one time, that there's what's called load balancing among those CDNs as well.
[03:16:45.123 --> 03:16:50.585]  So, that way it's fast and good or bigger and better than YouTube.
[03:16:50.585 --> 03:16:57.288]  And, once again, look, you can keep uploading all your videos to YouTube and let the big corporate Googles of the world make them.
[03:16:57.288 --> 03:16:57.568]  No, no, no.
[03:16:57.568 --> 03:16:57.988]  I mean, exactly.
[03:16:57.988 --> 03:17:05.112]  You go on YouTube and you promote things like YouDoNews.com and other things, and so what we do is we never quit YouTube.
[03:17:05.112 --> 03:17:08.133]  We battle there, but we battle on other fronts as well.
[03:17:08.626 --> 03:17:12.968]  But what I'm saying is, don't buy the lie the corporate media has told us that, oh, we've got to go viral.
[03:17:12.968 --> 03:17:13.988]  Think about this.
[03:17:13.988 --> 03:17:19.531]  You've produced one of the greatest documentaries, in my opinion, in the Obama deception, alright?
[03:17:19.531 --> 03:17:25.293]  Now, hundreds of thousands, millions of people have watched that, and they got to watch it for free.
[03:17:25.293 --> 03:17:35.038]  That's wonderful, and that's great, and we all love your heart, and we love your commitment, and we love the thought that, hey, you just want to get the information out into the hands of the people, because you know, you know the truth sets people free.
[03:17:35.598 --> 03:17:43.583]  But at the same time, I believe every laborer is worth their hire, and that you should be paid and compensated for the work that you do.
[03:17:43.583 --> 03:17:56.351]  So, once again, you can continue to put them on YouTube all you want, that's good, but once our ad revenue starts to go up, people may want to think twice about putting them anywhere but You Do News, because at least you're getting paid for every time someone
[03:17:56.771 --> 03:17:59.012]  No, no, I think it's great and then that funds your operation.
[03:17:59.012 --> 03:18:01.233]  I'm just able to fund it with DVD sales.
[03:18:01.233 --> 03:18:08.616]  Unfortunately, as the free quality gets better and better on the web, we see the DVD sales go down, but we've got other ways of raising money.
[03:18:08.616 --> 03:18:17.900]  And I do see it in the future, a couple years from now, where we may not be able to operate because one DVD gets sold and it's free everywhere in that same quality.
[03:18:17.900 --> 03:18:19.241]  I'm kind of destroying myself.
[03:18:19.901 --> 03:18:21.582]  But we don't have any future anyways if I don't.
[03:18:21.582 --> 03:18:25.024]  But no, that's what's great about You Do News and the rest of them.
[03:18:25.024 --> 03:18:32.789]  That's why we sell t-shirts and sell the DVDs and hope people will buy them so they have them in the higher quality at InfoWars.com.
[03:18:32.789 --> 03:18:34.490]  You're going to get the best of all worlds.
[03:18:34.490 --> 03:18:38.913]  You can continue to do what you've been doing, but you can also be getting that residual check.
[03:18:38.913 --> 03:18:46.979]  Just think, years from now when the Obama deception is still getting used, those are count towards your clicks, towards the total percentage that you get paid for the news you do.
[03:18:47.979 --> 03:18:49.280]  You'll get the best of all worlds.
[03:18:49.280 --> 03:18:51.480]  Like, once again, my heart is in this.
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:52.761]  Not for the money.
[03:18:52.761 --> 03:18:54.261]  The love of money is the root of all evil.
[03:18:54.261 --> 03:18:56.802]  Now, I love people and I care about my country.
[03:18:56.802 --> 03:18:59.443]  Yeah, but Darrell, I know because you've been a big contributor, actually, to this office.
[03:18:59.443 --> 03:19:00.724]  People don't even know about that.
[03:19:00.724 --> 03:19:02.925]  And you've owned quite a few big successful companies.
[03:19:02.925 --> 03:19:03.805]  And I'm glad you're doing this.
[03:19:03.805 --> 03:19:05.205]  You don't have to explain that.
[03:19:05.205 --> 03:19:08.247]  But it is true to get people paid will actually generate more.
[03:19:08.247 --> 03:19:09.987]  And we need to fund ourselves.
[03:19:09.987 --> 03:19:11.808]  The globalists take our money and taxes.
[03:19:12.208 --> 03:19:19.131]  And use it against us and then try to tell us we can't hang a sign up on a street corner, but the president tells his minions they can.
[03:19:19.131 --> 03:19:21.012]  So we need to get our own media.
[03:19:21.012 --> 03:19:24.713]  A great look, looks like YouTube actually, that's good.
[03:19:24.713 --> 03:19:33.677]  YouDoNews.com, and it's a genius name, and Darryl I know you've run multi-million dollar, you know, fifty, sixty, hundred million dollar companies a year.
[03:19:33.677 --> 03:19:35.518]  I forget, some of your companies I know are bigger than that.
[03:19:35.518 --> 03:19:39.520]  And I know you've been arrested for preaching the gospel in Dallas, I've seen that in the news.
[03:19:40.200 --> 03:19:41.321]  And so I'm aware of your great work.
[03:19:41.321 --> 03:19:43.864]  We're going to come back and talk more about this.
[03:19:43.864 --> 03:19:46.447]  YouDoNews.com.
[03:19:46.447 --> 03:19:49.049]  We're just here supporting alternative media and other venues.
[03:19:49.049 --> 03:19:51.992]  Coming up, we've got the gentleman who wore the gun on his side.
[03:19:51.992 --> 03:19:53.154]  Chris Matthews flipped out.
[03:19:53.154 --> 03:19:55.936]  That's coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show as well.
[03:19:55.936 --> 03:19:57.138]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:57.138 --> 03:20:00.121]  PrisonPlanet.tv is our subscription video site.
[03:20:01.391 --> 03:20:05.894]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:20:05.894 --> 03:20:08.456]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:20:08.456 --> 03:20:09.357]  He was devastated.
[03:20:09.357 --> 03:20:18.143]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:20:18.143 --> 03:20:24.348]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[03:20:24.348 --> 03:20:27.050]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[03:20:27.050 --> 03:20:29.431]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[03:20:30.552 --> 03:20:30.892]  I think so.
[03:20:53.251 --> 03:20:53.912]  Own Myself!

[03:22:01.673 --> 03:22:03.094]  It is a big idea.
[03:22:03.094 --> 03:22:05.916]  A New World Order.
[03:22:05.916 --> 03:22:10.799]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:22:10.799 --> 03:22:13.640]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:22:13.640 --> 03:22:16.422]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[03:22:16.422 --> 03:22:19.604]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:22:19.604 --> 03:22:26.908]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:22:29.946 --> 03:22:35.390]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:22:35.390 --> 03:22:39.252]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:22:39.252 --> 03:22:41.834]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:22:41.834 --> 03:22:42.995]  Most people have no idea.
[03:22:42.995 --> 03:22:43.775]  They're not after money.
[03:22:43.775 --> 03:22:45.056]  They have all the money they need.
[03:22:45.056 --> 03:22:46.037]  They're after power.
[03:22:46.037 --> 03:22:47.178]  That's what they're after these days.

[03:22:55.443 --> 03:22:56.684]  In Game.
[03:22:56.684 --> 03:22:58.705]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:22:58.705 --> 03:22:59.786]  You have been warned.
[03:23:01.347 --> 03:23:04.370]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:23:04.370 --> 03:23:09.695]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:23:09.695 --> 03:23:11.756]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:23:11.756 --> 03:23:16.761]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:23:16.761 --> 03:23:17.942]  How much do you want?
[03:23:17.942 --> 03:23:19.063]  When do you want it?
[03:23:19.063 --> 03:23:20.944]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:23:20.944 --> 03:23:22.025]  When will you need it?
[03:23:22.025 --> 03:23:24.227]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:23:24.227 --> 03:23:25.569]  Will there be any food?
[03:23:25.569 --> 03:23:26.870]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:23:27.210 --> 03:23:29.613]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[03:23:29.613 --> 03:23:32.337]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:23:32.337 --> 03:23:35.942]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:23:35.942 --> 03:23:39.747]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:23:39.747 --> 03:23:40.989]  How much will you need?
[03:23:40.989 --> 03:23:41.890]  We don't know.
[03:23:41.890 --> 03:23:42.992]  How much do you want?
[03:23:42.992 --> 03:23:43.693]  All you can get.
[03:23:43.933 --> 03:23:44.995]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:23:44.995 --> 03:23:48.059]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:23:48.059 --> 03:23:49.842]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:23:49.842 --> 03:23:50.743]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:24:18.200 --> 03:24:27.948]  We've got a news report that Michael Jordan on 9-11 will be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame and that's going to be part of Obama's 9-11 memorial.
[03:24:40.086 --> 03:24:42.187]  Notice why America's dumbed down and falling apart.
[03:24:42.187 --> 03:24:47.109]  Our heroes are not inventors, they're not scientists, they're not firemen that save kids in burning buildings.
[03:24:47.109 --> 03:24:48.849]  It's people that play basketball and football.
[03:24:48.849 --> 03:24:58.653]  And I'm not saying you can't like those guys and that's great, but the establishment has written in documents that they make your heroes sports icons so you don't have heroes that really matter.
[03:24:58.653 --> 03:25:02.214]  And then kids stop wanting to be an inventor or a scientist or a doctor.
[03:25:02.214 --> 03:25:06.516]  They want to be a basketball player and there's only a few slots for that.
[03:25:06.516 --> 03:25:08.417]  And it's this lottery economy.
[03:25:08.417 --> 03:25:08.857]  You see them
[03:25:09.975 --> 03:25:22.068]  On CNN they have this thing where for 30 seconds you beg for a job and then only certain people can get the slot and it's all about, you know, you got hope and change and you're rolling the dice.
[03:25:22.068 --> 03:25:24.691]  George Orwell talks about that in 1984.
[03:25:24.691 --> 03:25:25.992]  Very, very sick society.
[03:25:27.034 --> 03:25:29.716]  No, we need to take action ourselves.
[03:25:29.716 --> 03:25:33.018]  So many people talk about the government and the corruption, but they don't get involved.
[03:25:33.018 --> 03:25:34.899]  Start with videos.
[03:25:34.899 --> 03:25:36.060]  Start with websites.
[03:25:36.060 --> 03:25:38.161]  Start with audio blogs.
[03:25:38.161 --> 03:25:41.823]  So, Daryl Rundis, I can't wait until YouDoNews.com gets launched.
[03:25:41.823 --> 03:25:45.345]  What are some of your other websites you can plug today?
[03:25:45.345 --> 03:25:51.169]  Don't forget, I am still giving $20,000 away for anybody who can name the 10 Commandments in 20 seconds or less.
[03:25:51.169 --> 03:25:53.190]  So, we give that away in October.
[03:25:53.732 --> 03:25:56.975]  So I'm giving everyone an incentive to get back to the basics of
[03:26:16.332 --> 03:26:17.672]  So how does somebody win then?
[03:26:17.672 --> 03:26:21.353]  I mean, if it's easy, then how do you pick the one person?
[03:26:21.353 --> 03:26:22.173]  You've got a whole bunch of winners.
[03:26:22.173 --> 03:26:27.174]  Well, we put a video up there to train you in two minutes how to learn how to list the law and order in 20 seconds or less.
[03:26:27.174 --> 03:26:30.495]  And then in October, I forget the day, you'll have to go to the website and check.
[03:26:30.495 --> 03:26:34.536]  I'm going to get on the phone, start drawing names of those who registered one by one.
[03:26:34.536 --> 03:26:37.837]  First one I get on the phone that can do it gets 20 grand.
[03:26:37.837 --> 03:26:38.857]  That simple.
[03:26:38.857 --> 03:26:39.897]  Oh, that's great.
[03:26:39.897 --> 03:26:41.617]  That is certainly a good thing you're doing.
[03:26:41.617 --> 03:26:42.578]  I know you're good for it.
[03:26:42.578 --> 03:26:44.298]  You've certainly helped what we're doing here.
[03:26:45.089 --> 03:26:52.957]  Hey, I just wondered before we part ways, Alex, I just once again want to let everybody know I thank God for you and I know I speak for many others out there.
[03:26:52.957 --> 03:26:54.198]  It's not easy doing what you're doing.
[03:26:54.198 --> 03:26:56.180]  You're constantly being attacked.
[03:26:56.180 --> 03:26:59.263]  But remember, man, you catch most of the flack when you're over the target.
[03:26:59.263 --> 03:27:01.225]  So you just keep pushing that plow.
[03:27:01.225 --> 03:27:02.386]  You don't even think to look at that.
[03:27:03.735 --> 03:27:07.438]  Well, that is certainly the fact, Daryl, and as soon as you launch the site, we'll have you back up.
[03:27:07.438 --> 03:27:13.342]  You don't have to come down to Austin from Dallas to be in studio, but if you want to, that'd be great, and I can't wait.
[03:27:13.342 --> 03:27:14.783]  I'm glad you're doing this.
[03:27:14.783 --> 03:27:17.005]  To get the word out, YouDoNews.com.
[03:27:17.005 --> 03:27:23.870]  You, with just a you, YouDoNews.com, up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:25.511]  Hey, and one last thought.
[03:27:25.511 --> 03:27:30.155]  Remind people, you guys listening, that as an independent news journalist with YouDoNews,
[03:27:30.615 --> 03:27:38.202]  That gives you access as the press to press passes to get you into these events like Obama is going to be speaking at with Michael Jordan.
[03:27:38.202 --> 03:27:40.844]  So we'll be able to hook people up with those press passes.
[03:27:40.844 --> 03:27:45.288]  Sometimes you'll have to pass a background check and get on the police report list.
[03:27:45.288 --> 03:27:49.692]  But if you're willing and you're qualified then we can get you into those events.
[03:27:49.692 --> 03:27:50.273]  We can get you into
[03:27:51.897 --> 03:27:52.978]  Well, that's the exciting thing.
[03:27:52.978 --> 03:27:58.061]  People can do that with You Do News, or I challenge people to start their own news site, have it sound official, and do it.
[03:27:58.061 --> 03:28:00.122]  People ask how we get big guests on.
[03:28:00.122 --> 03:28:03.104]  We call their publicist.
[03:28:03.104 --> 03:28:08.468]  And say, hey, we see they got a new book out, you know, can we have this astronaut or this person on?
[03:28:08.468 --> 03:28:09.729]  That's how we do it.
[03:28:09.729 --> 03:28:15.492]  People think I like to do some secret handshake to get a big guest on, but it's called the telephone.
[03:28:15.492 --> 03:28:17.534]  I mean, you pick it up,
[03:28:18.334 --> 03:28:21.296]  I think you're right, but remember desperate people do desperate things.
[03:28:21.296 --> 03:28:22.897]  So that just reveals, I think to you and everybody else,
[03:28:43.226 --> 03:28:44.907]  Who's in the know that they're desperate.
[03:28:44.907 --> 03:28:45.627]  They're desperate.
[03:28:45.627 --> 03:29:02.213]  Now, we definitely need to be on guard because, uh, you know, desperate people do do desperate things and we don't know how desperate are they really, but the fact that they're trying to discredit you and ruin you or me or anybody that's ever associated with you, then, uh, that's actually a good thing.
[03:29:02.213 --> 03:29:05.314]  So look, they did the same thing to Crikey.
[03:29:05.314 --> 03:29:06.174]  So you're in good company.
[03:29:08.835 --> 03:29:09.435]  Absolutely.
[03:29:09.435 --> 03:29:12.957]  Darryl Rundis, we'll talk to you as soon as YouDoNews.com gets fully launched.
[03:29:12.957 --> 03:29:14.737]  Hey man, I'm going to leave you with one last scripture.
[03:29:14.737 --> 03:29:22.160]  Remember, James 417, anyone who knows the good they ought to do and they don't do it, it's a sin.
[03:29:22.160 --> 03:29:26.782]  So get up, get out, get busy doing something to take our country back.
[03:29:26.782 --> 03:29:28.583]  Absolutely, yeah.
[03:29:28.583 --> 03:29:29.643]  Darryl, good to hear from you.
[03:29:29.643 --> 03:29:30.463]  Take care, Alex.
[03:29:30.463 --> 03:29:31.224]  God bless.
[03:29:31.224 --> 03:29:31.564]  You bet.
[03:29:31.564 --> 03:29:32.124]  God bless you.
[03:29:32.124 --> 03:29:34.025]  When we come back, we're going to talk to the gentleman
[03:29:34.775 --> 03:29:45.001]  I got attacked by Chris Matthews as a thought criminal wearing that gun yesterday down the street from an event that Lord Obama was going to be attending for death care.
[03:29:45.001 --> 03:29:48.883]  The death committees, which really do exist.
[03:29:48.883 --> 03:29:51.745]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:51.745 --> 03:29:53.146]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.146 --> 03:29:55.667]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.667 --> 03:29:58.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.135 --> 03:30:05.376]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.376 --> 03:30:07.376]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.376 --> 03:30:15.898]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.898 --> 03:30:21.440]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.440 --> 03:30:23.060]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.300 --> 03:30:29.826]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.826 --> 03:30:40.896]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.896 --> 03:30:41.657]  That's right.
[03:30:41.657 --> 03:30:44.219]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:30:44.219 --> 03:30:45.820]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[03:30:48.362 --> 03:31:06.327]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:31:06.327 --> 03:31:08.388]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[03:31:08.388 --> 03:31:10.849]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:31:10.849 --> 03:31:13.109]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:31:13.109 --> 03:31:14.750]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:31:14.750 --> 03:31:15.770]  There is a solution.
[03:31:16.010 --> 03:31:24.437]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:31:37.949 --> 03:31:43.534]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[03:32:01.658 --> 03:32:06.179]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[03:32:06.179 --> 03:32:11.281]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:32:11.281 --> 03:32:12.781]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:32:12.781 --> 03:32:16.382]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[03:32:16.382 --> 03:32:21.803]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[03:32:27.905 --> 03:32:30.407]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[03:32:36.573 --> 03:32:37.754]  No animal testing.
[03:32:37.754 --> 03:32:39.096]  I use them and love them.
[03:32:39.096 --> 03:32:40.997]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[03:32:40.997 --> 03:32:42.419]  And I save big time.

[03:32:53.889 --> 03:33:03.932]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[03:33:03.932 --> 03:33:07.253]  Let's ask about the presidency and what he's trying to do with health care.
[03:33:07.253 --> 03:33:08.333]  You brought a loaded gun.
[03:33:08.333 --> 03:33:10.233]  Was your gun loaded today?
[03:33:10.233 --> 03:33:11.274]  Uh, wow.
[03:33:11.274 --> 03:33:13.374]  Who would be silly enough to carry an unloaded firearm?
[03:33:13.374 --> 03:33:14.174]  I'm only asking.
[03:33:14.174 --> 03:33:15.935]  You're answering the questions.
[03:33:15.935 --> 03:33:16.595]  Who's yelling now?
[03:33:16.595 --> 03:33:17.595]  Okay, that's on the tape.
[03:33:17.595 --> 03:33:19.816]  Why did you bring a loaded gun to a public meeting?
[03:33:20.416 --> 03:33:23.017]  Well, here in New Hampshire... I know the law.
[03:33:23.017 --> 03:33:24.338]  You can chew gum at church.
[03:33:24.338 --> 03:33:26.619]  You can ride in on a pogo stick.
[03:33:26.619 --> 03:33:28.700]  There's a lot of things you're legally allowed to do.
[03:33:28.700 --> 03:33:36.203]  Why did you bring a gun to a meeting with the President of the United States, given the violent history of this country with regard to presidents and assassinations?
[03:33:36.203 --> 03:33:39.185]  Why did you bring a gun to a public event with the President?
[03:33:40.502 --> 03:33:41.703]  You know the history of this country.
[03:33:41.703 --> 03:33:43.464]  If you love this country, you know it's history.
[03:33:43.464 --> 03:33:47.468]  You know we've had a problem with people with guns at presidential events.
[03:33:47.468 --> 03:33:50.430]  Why'd you bring a gun to an event with the president?
[03:33:50.430 --> 03:33:51.751]  I do know history.
[03:33:51.751 --> 03:34:00.357]  And the history is that our forefathers fought for the right to keep and bear armed, and they believe that every person should be armed.
[03:34:00.357 --> 03:34:00.698]  I know all that.
[03:34:00.698 --> 03:34:02.219]  Everybody knows that.
[03:34:02.219 --> 03:34:05.621]  Well, why did you bring a gun to a presidential event today?
[03:34:05.621 --> 03:34:07.023]  That's not even a relevant question.
[03:34:07.023 --> 03:34:09.745]  The question is, why don't people bear arms these days?
[03:34:10.405 --> 03:34:20.271]  Okay, you brought a sign that said the Tree of Liberty has to be watered with the blood of tyrants and you're carrying a goddamn gun at a presidential event.
[03:34:20.271 --> 03:34:23.092]  I think those things make people wonder what you're about.
[03:34:23.092 --> 03:34:25.794]  Right, the sign didn't say anything about blood.
[03:34:25.794 --> 03:34:26.454]  What did it say?
[03:34:26.454 --> 03:34:29.015]  It's time to water the Tree of Liberty.
[03:34:29.015 --> 03:34:29.936]  And where did that come from?
[03:34:30.336 --> 03:34:30.896]  That line?
[03:34:30.896 --> 03:34:32.197]  It's a quote from Thomas Jefferson.
[03:34:32.197 --> 03:34:34.099]  And what's the rest of the line?
[03:34:34.099 --> 03:34:36.360]  The rest of the line is for people to look up.
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:37.281]  It's not a soundbite.
[03:34:37.281 --> 03:34:39.082]  They need to understand the context in which it was spoken.
[03:34:39.082 --> 03:34:41.203]  What's the rest of the line from Jefferson?
[03:34:41.203 --> 03:34:45.546]  The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of tyrants and patriots.
[03:34:45.546 --> 03:34:50.909]  Okay, well you're carrying a gun and you're carrying that sign and you don't think people should worry about you?
[03:34:50.909 --> 03:34:52.550]  No, I don't think people should worry about me.
[03:34:52.550 --> 03:34:56.593]  Well let me ask you about the history of people that carry guns to presidential events.
[03:34:56.593 --> 03:34:57.634]  Tell me that history, sir.
[03:34:59.881 --> 03:35:01.903]  Are you speaking of a particular event?
[03:35:01.903 --> 03:35:05.287]  I'm talking about people who bring guns to presidential events.
[03:35:05.287 --> 03:35:07.369]  Tell me their history.
[03:35:07.369 --> 03:35:08.530]  I'll tell you this, Chris.
[03:35:08.530 --> 03:35:09.711]  We just started New History.
[03:35:09.711 --> 03:35:10.993]  I was there today.
[03:35:10.993 --> 03:35:14.837]  There was a peaceful rally.
[03:35:14.837 --> 03:35:15.818]  No one was injured.
[03:35:15.818 --> 03:35:17.740]  No one on our side was alarmed.
[03:35:18.400 --> 03:35:22.863]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:35:22.863 --> 03:35:25.085]  Run on for a long time.
[03:35:25.085 --> 03:35:28.768]  Run on for a long time.
[03:35:28.768 --> 03:35:33.351]  I want to thank Jaren for staying up here late last night to get a hold of William Kostrick.
[03:35:33.351 --> 03:35:35.493]  When I first heard the news reporting this it was like...
[03:35:36.053 --> 03:35:39.614]  Guy with an earpiece out there with a gun right in front of Obama?
[03:35:39.614 --> 03:35:47.075]  No, he was down the street at a private rally in New Hampshire where they're trying to reclaim their liberty by openly demonstrating the Second Amendment.
[03:35:47.075 --> 03:35:48.596]  That's how you get it back.
[03:35:48.596 --> 03:36:00.058]  They've got us to hide in our houses with it to where now every day or two I see an article of some old man working on his rifle in his garage and the neighbors in Texas call the police and they come arrest him or in Illinois or anywhere.
[03:36:01.147 --> 03:36:03.769]  So, William Kostrick does have a lot of courage to do that.
[03:36:03.769 --> 03:36:11.255]  Some other fellow today, hours before Obama even arrived in New Hampshire, they arrested him saying, was he legal to have a gun without a permit?
[03:36:11.255 --> 03:36:15.079]  You don't have to have a permit to have a gun in New Hampshire, or most states.
[03:36:15.079 --> 03:36:17.741]  So, that just illustrates what he's talking about.
[03:36:17.741 --> 03:36:21.904]  He's with the Free States Project, he had a big Restore the Republic sign.
[03:36:21.904 --> 03:36:26.008]  We talked to Gary Franchi yesterday, Kurt Nimmo did, and said, no, no, we know that guy, he really is a patriot.
[03:36:26.528 --> 03:36:27.449]  It's good to be with you.
[03:36:46.806 --> 03:36:47.806]  Tell us about yourself.
[03:36:47.806 --> 03:36:50.668]  Tell us where you really were, what you were doing.
[03:36:50.668 --> 03:36:58.571]  I've seen very few people do as well with Chris Matthews because he won't let you talk and since they're attacking you.
[03:36:58.571 --> 03:37:06.695]  I think you cleaned Chris Matthews' clock almost as good as when we went and shut him down with a bullhorn, but you know that's one in a million thanks to the great demonstrators.
[03:37:06.695 --> 03:37:09.396]  But no, no, seriously, one-on-one you did a great job.
[03:37:09.396 --> 03:37:13.958]  I don't think I could have done a job as good as you did being calm while that weasel was talking to you.
[03:37:15.222 --> 03:37:17.966]  Well, I gotta tell you, I was sweating.
[03:37:17.966 --> 03:37:19.387]  It was rough.
[03:37:19.387 --> 03:37:21.130]  He's good at what he does.
[03:37:21.130 --> 03:37:22.932]  I don't hold him any ill will.
[03:37:22.932 --> 03:37:26.316]  I see a lot of people wrote some nasty things about him.
[03:37:26.316 --> 03:37:28.960]  You know, fact is, the name of the show is Hardball.
[03:37:28.960 --> 03:37:29.621]  That's what he does.
[03:37:30.768 --> 03:37:33.432]  That's what I expected walking in.
[03:37:33.432 --> 03:37:35.495]  I've been in sales for a while.
[03:37:35.495 --> 03:37:39.381]  I have a little bit of experience public speaking, so that helped out.
[03:37:39.381 --> 03:37:42.005]  But even so, it was pretty brutal.
[03:37:42.005 --> 03:37:46.552]  And I was glad watching it afterwards that everything went as well as it did.
[03:37:48.257 --> 03:37:53.262]  Absolutely, and people can watch the whole clip up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:37:53.262 --> 03:38:04.874]  Tell us about what you actually saw out at the event, and then what made you think, I'm going to go wear a sidearm on my side, and I'm going to have a sign saying, Water the Tree of Liberty.
[03:38:10.017 --> 03:38:10.578]  Yeah.
[03:38:31.437 --> 03:38:32.298]  He's coming in.
[03:38:32.298 --> 03:38:34.039]  It's going to be a big deal.
[03:38:34.039 --> 03:38:38.142]  And I'm like, well, you know, someone should be there open carrying.
[03:38:38.142 --> 03:38:41.164]  And everybody kind of looked at me like I was a little off.
[03:38:41.164 --> 03:38:43.926]  And I said, well, you know, then I'll go do it.
[03:38:45.428 --> 03:38:51.711]  But what you're doing is so revolutionary that I mean, people wimp out on this.
[03:38:51.711 --> 03:38:58.573]  And even in Texas now, if you're trying to walk with a shotgun by your own ranch down the side of a highway, a cop will pull up and ask what you're doing.
[03:38:58.573 --> 03:39:02.895]  In America, no one dare carry a rifle in the back of their pickup truck anymore.
[03:39:02.895 --> 03:39:04.876]  Just 15 years ago, you saw it everywhere.
[03:39:04.876 --> 03:39:07.337]  They're killing our culture, you and others.
[03:39:07.337 --> 03:39:12.199]  I know Vermont, New Hampshire, Arizona, a few other states, people are open carrying everywhere.
[03:39:12.199 --> 03:39:12.859]  Colorado,
[03:39:13.479 --> 03:39:17.040]  And the slaves are having to learn that this is their right.
[03:39:17.040 --> 03:39:24.602]  I saw a violence policy center, Brady gun grab group on MSNBC this morning.
[03:39:24.602 --> 03:39:27.963]  They were talking about you and others viciously, how dangerous it is.
[03:39:27.963 --> 03:39:31.183]  But see, they've got all their armed police and all their weapons.
[03:39:31.183 --> 03:39:34.004]  They're threatened by their slaves.
[03:39:34.004 --> 03:39:42.106]  They're like Bengal tigers in the jungles of India, not liking to see a little deer suddenly grow big claws and fangs.
[03:39:42.606 --> 03:39:50.436]  So we are their food, and of course they're going to want us to be declawed and defanged before they drop out of a tree like a boa constrictor and have their way with us.
[03:39:52.028 --> 03:40:07.100]  Yeah, it's interesting because the truth is, I don't know the exact number, but I think over 40 states it's legal to open carry-in, but the vast majority of those you don't dare unless you want to get your face slammed into the ground.
[03:40:07.100 --> 03:40:13.465]  And New Hampshire is a place where you still generally can.
[03:40:13.465 --> 03:40:20.531]  As activists, we have had a few incidents, nothing brutal, but minor harassment, and we've gone
[03:40:20.911 --> 03:40:30.656]  Spoke to the police chief, spoke to the media, spoke to the mayor, and educated them on that everyone who's carrying a firearm is not a criminal.
[03:40:30.656 --> 03:40:41.140]  And that's why it's important for people to do it regularly, to be seen doing it, so that people don't make the assumption when they see a firearm that it's a criminal.
[03:40:41.140 --> 03:40:48.944]  They need to see it so often that when they see it, the assumption is, that's a law-abiding citizen, that's my neighbor, that's a guy that I can trust.
[03:40:50.011 --> 03:40:54.715]  Well, what you're doing is as revolutionary as it gets to restore the Republic.
[03:40:54.715 --> 03:40:58.459]  And, uh, Mr. Kosher, I can only commend what you're doing.
[03:40:58.459 --> 03:41:10.250]  Uh, how did... I'm glad that, uh, I'm glad that you guys, uh, were, uh, that you, I guess, were, were able to talk to Gary and clear up, at least on your site, this, uh, whole, uh, agent provocateur thing.
[03:41:10.250 --> 03:41:14.054]  Uh, it still seems pretty widespread in other areas of the...
[03:41:15.233 --> 03:41:24.824]  Well, I mean, we see the Fed's provocateur stuff constantly, and so nine times out of ten it is.
[03:41:24.824 --> 03:41:32.912]  And then to see somebody with incredible courage like yourself, because it's one thing to do open carry in New Hampshire or Colorado or Vermont or Arizona.
[03:41:34.091 --> 03:41:53.502]  at some event or when you're out doing business but I mean when the president's coming around again just amazing courage on your part and I don't think it's really an apology but more of a correction that well we didn't say you were fed for sure we said we'll find out and we did and then corrected it again your bold courage and Thomas Jefferson spirit
[03:41:54.362 --> 03:42:22.365]  uh... just uh... you know really puts us to shame so we commend you uh... but absolutely what was it like when you were out there what was it like you were talking to the fellow who was out there i guess a few blocks away from where obama was out on private property with a handgun strapped to his hip uh... to his thigh uh... and the water the tree of liberty uh... quote uh... from thomas jefferson uh... i was in the thick of the uh... protesting area for a good half hour
[03:42:23.427 --> 03:42:35.590]  Forty minutes, I don't know, at least a half an hour, and many of the state police, the local police, they've walked past me numerous times, countless times already.
[03:42:35.590 --> 03:42:41.632]  You know, I'm there holding my sign, and then we see
[03:42:42.692 --> 03:42:51.902]  Um, them moving through the crowd, looking down, and someone said to me, oh, they're checking people's hands, and of course I knew at that moment that no, they're looking for me.
[03:42:51.902 --> 03:43:00.752]  So, you know, I just waited there with my sign, and the gentleman who came up to me, Lieutenant McDonald,
[03:43:01.332 --> 03:43:03.494]  I was very cordial, extremely polite.
[03:43:03.494 --> 03:43:10.719]  I saw someone say on one of the comments that, oh, if a cop sees someone with a gun or something like this, they don't just walk up and say hi.
[03:43:10.719 --> 03:43:13.081]  Well, that's exactly what happened.
[03:43:13.081 --> 03:43:17.504]  He walked up, he introduced himself, he said, would you mind stepping off to the side and speaking with me?
[03:43:18.284 --> 03:43:18.584]  I did.
[03:43:18.584 --> 03:43:25.627]  We have video of the entire encounter from the time he walked up to the end of it.
[03:43:25.627 --> 03:43:27.608]  Very cordial, very polite.
[03:43:27.608 --> 03:43:29.128]  Is that posted yet?
[03:43:29.128 --> 03:43:32.230]  I'd like to play that here because we're also doing a TV show right now.
[03:43:32.230 --> 03:43:36.311]  It is nowhere online as of right now.
[03:43:36.311 --> 03:43:37.552]  We need to get that up on YouTube.
[03:43:39.492 --> 03:43:41.894]  We've been working on that.
[03:43:41.894 --> 03:43:43.315]  We've been working on it.
[03:43:43.315 --> 03:43:44.076]  Well good, good.
[03:43:44.076 --> 03:43:45.097]  Can't wait to see that.
[03:43:45.097 --> 03:43:47.780]  Actually, there were several cameras on the scene.
[03:43:47.780 --> 03:43:47.980]  Good.
[03:43:47.980 --> 03:43:51.984]  Is there a website that we should look for it to service on?
[03:43:51.984 --> 03:43:53.645]  Not yet.
[03:43:53.645 --> 03:43:55.287]  Okay, well, I mean on YouTube.
[03:43:55.287 --> 03:43:57.269]  What are you going to call the video?
[03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.709]  Patriot...
[03:44:01.363 --> 03:44:03.566]  Wow, what do you suggest?
[03:44:03.566 --> 03:44:08.373]  No, no, I'm just thinking because I want to post it on InfoWars and Prison Planet as soon as it comes up, William.
[03:44:08.373 --> 03:44:12.620]  As soon as we get it taken care of, you'll be the first to know.
[03:44:12.620 --> 03:44:13.481]  Okay, well you're awesome.
[03:44:13.481 --> 03:44:14.582]  I'll send you an update.
[03:44:15.546 --> 03:44:15.826]  You bet.
[03:44:15.826 --> 03:44:19.907]  Well, I always talk about how we've got to save the gun culture by exercising it openly.
[03:44:19.907 --> 03:44:25.128]  Because, I mean, it's gotten to the point in Texas where a carpet cleaner comes to your house and sees a gun case and calls the cops.
[03:44:25.128 --> 03:44:32.550]  Because they live on TV land and they think because everything's based in New York and Chicago on these dramas that those cop shows are real.
[03:44:32.550 --> 03:44:35.871]  The general public thinks those actors are real people.
[03:44:35.871 --> 03:44:38.912]  I mean, the public's, like, literally under mind control.
[03:44:38.912 --> 03:44:41.613]  And so they come to your house and think your guns are illegal.
[03:44:41.613 --> 03:44:43.013]  So what you're doing is invaluable.
[03:44:43.853 --> 03:44:47.497]  But what was it like once the national media contacted you?
[03:44:47.497 --> 03:44:49.238]  Were you like, how did you do that?
[03:44:49.238 --> 03:44:51.400]  I mean, Chris Matthews didn't know what to do.
[03:44:51.400 --> 03:45:02.670]  The fact that we're not cowed, that you're not cowed, that people are breaking their spell, and that you weren't apologetic to him, that was just devastating.
[03:45:03.339 --> 03:45:08.442]  Well, the way it went down, yeah, unremorseful.
[03:45:08.442 --> 03:45:14.186]  I think that's the way I'm labeled on the Arianna Huffington site, amazingly enough.
[03:45:14.186 --> 03:45:24.754]  So, yeah, what happened is he went ahead and asked me if I was aware of the federal law, 1,000 feet from a school.
[03:45:24.754 --> 03:45:30.738]  I said that I was, that there were exceptions to that, that I was an exception to that, and he called it in.
[03:45:30.738 --> 03:45:32.179]  He said, basically, that
[03:45:34.749 --> 03:45:36.490]  That doesn't matter.
[03:45:36.490 --> 03:45:45.537]  Because it's a school, they can ask me to leave, and if I refuse to leave, then I would be arrested, in fact, for trespassing.
[03:45:45.537 --> 03:45:48.159]  So the cop said this to you?
[03:45:48.159 --> 03:45:49.020]  He did.
[03:45:49.020 --> 03:45:51.762]  Once again, he was very polite.
[03:45:51.762 --> 03:45:57.666]  He was calling in, checking back with whoever was in charge there.
[03:45:57.666 --> 03:46:00.609]  But you can't have a slave with a gun near the emperor.
[03:46:01.573 --> 03:46:12.867]  Well, you did say we're going to have to move you 1,000 feet, and this is where things just got really amazing, because I said, well, okay, I mean, where is the 1,000 foot line?
[03:46:14.785 --> 03:46:16.046]  And he didn't know.
[03:46:16.046 --> 03:46:20.448]  So he got on the phone and started trying to find out.
[03:46:20.448 --> 03:46:27.012]  Meanwhile, there's been such a ruckus that these news agencies are starting to come up and talk to me.
[03:46:27.012 --> 03:46:31.434]  So actually, it took him about 10 to 12 minutes to get an answer back.
[03:46:31.434 --> 03:46:35.737]  Meanwhile, I'm conducting interviews with the Boston Globe, the New York Post.
[03:46:35.737 --> 03:46:38.118]  I mean, they're coming up right there.
[03:46:38.118 --> 03:46:39.539]  And so he comes back.
[03:46:40.459 --> 03:46:47.963]  And he says, well, we're going to ask you to move down to the end of the block, past the barricade.
[03:46:47.963 --> 03:46:50.684]  And I said, well, that's more than 1,000 feet.
[03:46:50.684 --> 03:46:56.327]  And he's like, well, I don't really know where the 1,000 feet is, but that's what we're going to ask you to do.
[03:46:56.327 --> 03:47:03.011]  And he said, I can't even tell you if I would arrest you if you refuse to do that, because, you know, he was
[03:47:03.909 --> 03:47:16.519]  He was clearly not wanting to arrest me and he wasn't going to do so unless ordered by higher-ups is the impression that I was getting.
[03:47:16.519 --> 03:47:24.164]  So at this point I had to make a judgment call and I was undecided as to what the right thing to do here was.
[03:47:26.098 --> 03:47:47.050]  At that time he got a call on his cell phone and who exactly it was, I'm not 100% I believe that it was the police chief who came through and said that apparently right maybe 30 feet from where I was currently standing when this whole incident started
[03:47:47.910 --> 03:47:53.058]  That there was a church and that church was private property and therefore I would be alright there.
[03:47:53.058 --> 03:48:01.791]  So instead of pushing the thousand foot permit issue, I just moved over and that's where I stood through the rest of the event.
[03:48:02.642 --> 03:48:07.703]  Well, the issue here is, we've been trained by the police that we can't have our rifles in our cars.
[03:48:07.703 --> 03:48:09.124]  There's no law.
[03:48:09.124 --> 03:48:12.665]  They'll just beat you in the head with a club and find something to take you to prison for.
[03:48:12.665 --> 03:48:15.625]  We have to teach them that's illegal and criminal.
[03:48:15.625 --> 03:48:18.326]  Even in Texas, we've been castrated.
[03:48:18.326 --> 03:48:24.828]  You obviously haven't been in Vermont, Arizona, and New Hampshire, and a few areas of Colorado.
[03:48:24.828 --> 03:48:25.568]  I commend you.
[03:48:26.808 --> 03:48:27.709]  It's just amazing.
[03:48:27.709 --> 03:48:32.951]  We should start a national organization, somebody should, for having these events in numbers.
[03:48:32.951 --> 03:48:51.238]  I know the Black Panthers, and I support what they did in Houston, marched armed, because this is our right of free humans, and if we allow them through the common law to restrict us, practice is a large part of the law, and it becomes the common law.
[03:48:52.162 --> 03:48:53.262]  Go ahead.
[03:48:53.262 --> 03:48:55.123]  Exactly.
[03:48:55.123 --> 03:48:56.843]  And you're absolutely right.
[03:48:56.843 --> 03:48:58.224]  And I lived in Arizona.
[03:48:58.224 --> 03:48:59.044]  I came from Arizona.
[03:48:59.044 --> 03:49:04.806]  And I moved to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project to work to achieve liberty in our lifetime.
[03:49:04.806 --> 03:49:05.926]  And Arizona's not a half bad state.
[03:49:08.107 --> 03:49:09.968]  State when it comes to gun laws, right?
[03:49:09.968 --> 03:49:14.409]  But they started doing the, uh, they were one of the first states to go with the Real ID.
[03:49:14.409 --> 03:49:23.171]  We had Governor Napolitano and, uh, I saw what was happening in New Hampshire and I said, you know, that's the last bastion of freedom.
[03:49:23.171 --> 03:49:26.913]  This is where the nanny staters, uh, don't want to be, right?
[03:49:26.913 --> 03:49:29.293]  Yeah, we have to... This is the state that has no
[03:49:32.054 --> 03:49:33.016]  State income tax.
[03:49:33.016 --> 03:49:36.101]  It's the last state that has no seatbelt laws.
[03:49:36.101 --> 03:49:38.606]  It has no mandatory insurance.
[03:49:38.606 --> 03:49:45.097]  I mean, there's so many things that the live free or die state, the spirit of the locals, they live that way.
[03:49:45.967 --> 03:49:48.928]  Yeah, we have to make it the custom again.
[03:49:48.928 --> 03:49:53.689]  We have to practice and exercise these freedoms or they atrophy and die.
[03:49:53.689 --> 03:49:59.671]  To the point of now, you gotta hide your guns with repair people in Texas because they think they're illegal and they want a bounty.
[03:49:59.671 --> 03:50:04.992]  The billboards everywhere say report illegal guns, show a picture of a revolver, the moron public.
[03:50:05.752 --> 03:50:08.655]  Uh, doesn't know that and so thank God for you.
[03:50:08.655 --> 03:50:19.805]  Millions of people yesterday all over international TV learned that wait you're allowed to have a gun and so maybe when I have an exterminator in my house he won't go call the police on me.
[03:50:19.805 --> 03:50:20.106]  Uh, so...
[03:50:20.566 --> 03:50:29.379]  I just saw the headline coming out of England where apparently I'm labeled a gunman and interestingly in some of the articles that I read I'm labeled a loner.
[03:50:29.379 --> 03:50:35.688]  So I've been labeled a loner and a gunman but so far not a lone gunman so we'll see if
[03:50:35.748 --> 03:50:41.910]  Maybe you fire magic bullets that can shoot through two or three people through a bunch of bones and metal and not be damaged.
[03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:50.954]  Maybe you're like the Lucky Charms leprechaun that you hop around like the Fighting Irish with gold coins shooting out of your mouth.
[03:50:50.954 --> 03:50:51.954]  Stay there, Mr. Kostrick.
[03:50:51.954 --> 03:50:53.855]  I want to get a few final comments from you.
[03:50:53.855 --> 03:50:55.636]  Maybe have you up for a full hour in the near future.
[03:50:55.636 --> 03:50:59.277]  You're a very interesting person, and New Hampshire sounds like a better and better place to live.
[03:51:01.849 --> 03:51:09.636]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.
[03:51:09.636 --> 03:51:14.701]  Get prepared and go to here'swhatyoudo.net and buy the $6 book.
[03:51:14.701 --> 03:51:20.226]  He is also trying to help us by running for Congress to stop the thievery and loss of liberties.
[03:51:20.486 --> 03:51:25.172]  Please arm yourself with his guide and go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.

[03:51:29.177 --> 03:51:31.640]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[03:51:31.640 --> 03:51:33.242]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[03:51:33.242 --> 03:51:37.787]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[03:51:37.787 --> 03:51:40.130]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman.
[03:51:40.250 --> 03:51:40.530]  We're good.
[03:52:02.757 --> 03:52:08.802]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.802 --> 03:52:14.687]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.687 --> 03:52:20.832]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:21.172 --> 03:52:23.134]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:23.134 --> 03:52:25.617]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:52:25.617 --> 03:52:36.529]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.780 --> 03:52:40.462]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.462 --> 03:52:42.324]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:42.324 --> 03:52:49.231]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:52:57.500 --> 03:52:59.061]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:59.061 --> 03:53:00.263]  The people strike back.
[03:53:02.079 --> 03:53:09.304]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters, also known as RFID chips, in millions of passports, credit cards, and licenses?
[03:53:09.304 --> 03:53:13.246]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[03:53:13.246 --> 03:53:21.291]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[03:53:21.551 --> 03:53:24.454]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[03:53:24.454 --> 03:53:27.257]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[03:53:27.257 --> 03:53:31.701]  Thieves get near you, push a button and these tiny radios give out personal information.
[03:53:31.701 --> 03:53:33.343]  Put a stop to identity theft.
[03:53:33.343 --> 03:53:35.425]  Visit IDStronghold.com.
[03:53:35.425 --> 03:53:37.727]  Here you will find radio blocking secure sleeves.
[03:53:38.167 --> 03:53:45.749]  Simply place your credit cards and passports into these slim, lightweight sleeves and you will put a stop to anyone trying to collect your private information.
[03:53:45.749 --> 03:53:49.690]  For around $5, you will be protected against RFID theft.

[03:53:54.631 --> 03:53:55.131]  Or call 1-800-610-2770.
[03:53:55.131 --> 03:53:55.311]  1-800-610-2770 today.
[03:54:10.218 --> 03:54:13.199]  William Kostrick, we gotta have him back up soon.
[03:54:13.199 --> 03:54:15.120]  I noticed a line.
[03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:20.221]  They arrested a guy in New Hampshire hours before Obama even got there.
[03:54:20.221 --> 03:54:22.482]  Somewhere near where he was gonna speak.
[03:54:22.482 --> 03:54:24.523]  They're looking in cars for guns.
[03:54:24.523 --> 03:54:27.223]  And they said he was arrested for not having a registered gun.
[03:54:27.223 --> 03:54:29.944]  There's no registry law in New Hampshire.
[03:54:29.944 --> 03:54:31.605]  So I wanted to ask Mr. Kostrick about that.
[03:54:31.605 --> 03:54:32.225]  I kept saying,
[03:54:32.765 --> 03:54:34.867]  Hearing in the news your gun was registered.
[03:54:34.867 --> 03:54:38.849]  Let me guess, there's no reason to register a gun when there's no law to register it.
[03:54:38.849 --> 03:54:44.473]  That's more of that mass lie as if the whole country is New York City and lower Manhattan.
[03:54:44.473 --> 03:54:47.735]  Let me guess, your gun wasn't registered and it was all a lie?
[03:54:47.735 --> 03:54:48.796]  That is correct.
[03:54:48.796 --> 03:54:50.177]  That is correct.
[03:54:50.177 --> 03:54:53.259]  My gun was neither registered nor was it required to be.
[03:54:53.259 --> 03:55:01.105]  And interestingly, to the horror of many out there, they didn't, they at no point even asked me for ID.
[03:55:02.639 --> 03:55:14.203]  At no point during the event, during the footage, all the time that I talk to the cops, all the time that they ask me, you know, to please relocate, the whole thing, I was never even asked.
[03:55:14.203 --> 03:55:18.145]  Well, the truth is, if you were a criminal that wanted to go after the President, it wouldn't be open.
[03:55:18.145 --> 03:55:26.107]  That's why they have a permit for a concealed, because it's illegal under common law to conceal a weapon, only criminals and murderers do that.
[03:55:26.107 --> 03:55:27.788]  Free men wear weapons openly.
[03:55:28.348 --> 03:55:31.029]  And we need to get back to being free men, not slaves.
[03:55:31.029 --> 03:55:38.210]  In England and others, those poor people, now they're putting cameras in the parents' rooms, watching them 24 hours a day.
[03:55:38.210 --> 03:55:42.051]  That's what happens when they get your guns in Australia, in England.
[03:55:42.051 --> 03:55:44.371]  Mr. Kostrick, are there any websites you want to plug?
[03:55:44.371 --> 03:55:52.433]  Freestateproject.org, New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, and start there.
[03:55:52.433 --> 03:55:56.614]  There are a dozen great, off the top of my head,
[03:55:58.926 --> 03:56:01.767]  I've got more looking forward to being back.
[03:56:17.458 --> 03:56:17.718]  You bet.
[03:56:17.718 --> 03:56:18.559]  We look forward to having you.
[03:56:18.559 --> 03:56:20.200]  I'll have Jaren set you up next week.
[03:56:20.200 --> 03:56:21.040]  Thank you.
[03:56:21.040 --> 03:56:26.243]  I just wanted to add before the show ended that I was just watching CNN during the break, that same congressman.
[03:56:26.243 --> 03:56:31.866]  They are loving the swastika on the congressman's sign.
[03:56:31.866 --> 03:56:35.368]  Because he screamed at his constituents and told them they were basically scum.
[03:56:35.368 --> 03:56:36.008]  It backfired.
[03:56:36.008 --> 03:56:37.789]  Then somebody went and sprayed that.
[03:56:37.789 --> 03:56:39.490]  That swastika is saving his butt.
[03:56:40.745 --> 03:56:47.213]  And I bet if it does come out in the wash, somebody affiliated with the congressman sprayed that because people have been caught.
[03:56:47.213 --> 03:56:52.921]  We need an article about people being caught putting swastikas on their own property at the dorms and churches and everywhere else.
[03:56:52.921 --> 03:56:53.662]  We're sick of it.
[03:56:54.745 --> 03:56:55.745]  And this is what they're going to do.
[03:56:55.745 --> 03:56:59.406]  They're going to victimize themselves to demonize us.
[03:56:59.406 --> 03:56:59.946]  Guaranteed.
[03:56:59.946 --> 03:57:01.727]  We've got a minute and a half left.
[03:57:01.727 --> 03:57:05.368]  I twisted Ted's arm because gold is up again right now.
[03:57:05.368 --> 03:57:13.790]  He still has gold left from three weeks ago, gold and silver, when gold was almost $60 lower than it is now, and silver was a couple bucks lower than it is now.
[03:57:13.790 --> 03:57:19.271]  But he is almost running out of this, and if it keeps going up, I've never seen him extend the offer this long.
[03:57:19.271 --> 03:57:22.492]  Quickly, Ted, tell folks about the coins and the number here at the end of the show.
[03:57:23.211 --> 03:57:26.752]  Yeah, Walking Liberty halves right now at $8.69.
[03:57:26.752 --> 03:57:32.915]  The Frank coin is still currently at $216, and the British Sovereign is at $266.
[03:57:32.915 --> 03:57:39.017]  All those coins are relative to gold sitting around $9.11, silver closer to $11 an ounce.
[03:57:39.017 --> 03:57:50.602]  Of course, we all know that silver's been poking into $15, and gold into the $9.60 level, so there's been a great movement forward, and I'm just grateful that there's a couple of little dips in the time here.
[03:57:50.602 --> 03:57:52.743]  Just yesterday, I was able to accumulate something else.
[03:57:53.063 --> 03:57:53.283]  800-686-2237.
[03:57:53.283 --> 03:57:53.383]  800-686-2237.
[03:57:53.383 --> 03:57:57.830]  The lying media says don't get gold, but all the wealthy people have been piling in on it.
[03:58:08.965 --> 03:58:10.827]  You cannot beat this deal.
[03:58:10.827 --> 03:58:13.009]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:13.009 --> 03:58:18.656]  Brokers will be there till midnight tonight, and I'm sure Ted can hold that deal until tomorrow, so don't wait.
[03:58:18.656 --> 03:58:20.017]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:20.017 --> 03:58:26.284]  Even if it's a silver half-dollar, a silver dollar, a quarter-ounce gold coin, or a hundred ounces of gold, they got your needs.
[03:58:26.284 --> 03:58:26.404]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:26.404 --> 03:58:26.764]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:26.764 --> 03:58:28.206]  Thank you, Ted.
[03:58:31.229 --> 03:58:32.249]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:58:32.249 --> 03:58:32.510]  You bet.
[03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:35.691]  And great job to John Harmon up in Minnesota, up in Mission Control.
[03:58:35.691 --> 03:58:37.792]  Great job to Cape Canaveral down here.
[03:58:37.792 --> 03:58:38.652]  Retransmission.
[03:58:38.652 --> 03:58:39.933]  Powerful transmission.
[03:58:39.933 --> 03:58:43.454]  Coming up now, InfoWars.com.
[03:58:43.454 --> 03:58:46.035]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:51.564 --> 03:58:56.768]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:58:56.768 --> 03:59:00.791]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.791 --> 03:59:06.696]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.696 --> 03:59:11.759]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.759 --> 03:59:12.260]  Number three,
[03:59:12.680 --> 03:59:18.962]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:59:18.962 --> 03:59:21.863]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:59:21.863 --> 03:59:26.384]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:26.384 --> 03:59:29.985]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:59:30.225 --> 03:59:35.972]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:59:35.972 --> 03:59:40.677]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
