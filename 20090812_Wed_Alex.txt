[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  well we've been front page of the drudge report on the top story since last night it
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  is all over TV all over radio exactly as we had planned that's the reason I did the
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.000]  whole Joker bit because I don't take myself too seriously sometimes I did it to promote
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  the contest and I did tell people last week and on the Sunday show and yesterday please
[01:03.000 --> 01:11.000]  put it in the commons area light poles telephone poles in the bar districts on the bulletin
[01:11.000 --> 01:19.000]  boards don't do anything uncivil check your local laws but the media is saying it's an
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  act of vandalism and active terrorism and they get to whine and suck their thumbs out
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  of hundreds of cities I mean we're talking Belfast Ireland London England Sheffield
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  England Moscow Russia Tokyo Japan San Antonio Texas Dallas Texas San Diego Los
[01:37.000 --> 01:46.000]  Angeles Seattle Kansas City St. Louis Indianapolis Indiana everywhere I mean the
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  videos are pouring in hundreds of them and I'd say 98% of the videos I've seen a
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  couple 98% looked at the contest rules and are following them haven't been too over
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  zealous you're putting them on power poles common areas hanging them up over other
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  broadsheets it's what I said hang them up in those high traffic areas and so when
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  they try to whine and suck their thumb and say you need to be arrested you know
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  how did you call for arresting all these rock and roll posters and church posters
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.000]  and broadsheets and local ads for the five and dime or the swap meet or the flea
[02:24.000 --> 02:31.000]  market or the lost cat or the lost dog or the missing persons we posted a bunch of
[02:31.000 --> 02:39.000]  these photos you can just Google handbills on wall or flyers on power pole or
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  light pole you'll get thousands of images you've all seen them I mean what what
[02:43.000 --> 02:51.000]  pole what wouldn't pole in a town or city doesn't have I knew because I always
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  thought it was almost a work of art I knew that when I said when I googled nails
[02:56.000 --> 03:03.000]  in telephone pole that it would be art that that that photographers because I've
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  seen it many times and thought that looks like a work of art all these
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  thousands of individual diverse nails different types nailed in different ways
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  some crooked some straight old pieces of metal ripped off staples I remember when
[03:18.000 --> 03:28.000]  I was putting up last week dresses the Joker in South Austin on Old Torf this is
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  a work of art so this morning when I call Watson up and I I said I'm going to
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  send you some images of people that have taken photographs of nails as art I mean
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  people put so many posters up so many broadsheets up that from eight feet in the
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  air down to two feet in the air on the side of the pole it's just solid nails
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.000]  and staples and I think it's kind of pretty and I'm glad other people think
[03:59.000 --> 04:06.000]  the same thing doesn't matter anymore I'll probably be arrested because I try to
[04:06.000 --> 04:14.000]  be artistic I'm evil I'm bad it's okay to put the sign up saying you've got a
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  drive sale but don't you put an image up of Barack Obama as the Joker and then
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  there's the whole hypocritic area the hypocritical area the hypocritical
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  angle of you can show Bush is a vampire a demon and a devil a Joker that's fine
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  that we even found old clip art where they'd had programs hanging him up on
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  power poles that's okay but no they're on the news saying we need to be arrested

[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  replacement you just go off and get on an ice flow lady and go die according to
[08:53.000 --> 09:01.000]  them Obama sees thread at these town halls and AP weighs in official see
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  rise in militia groups across the US this is the new pre-government inaugural
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  bombing where they're going to bomb themselves everybody feels sorry for the
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  government so they can raise new taxes on us that that's the big news today I'm
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  going to be going over that also when Steve quail joins us coming up in an
[09:21.000 --> 09:30.000]  hour Obama says that we all need to take three to four of the new genetically
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  engineered cloned it's cloned that's how they can come out with vaccines in a
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  month or two instead of six months in the old-fashioned way of doing it this is
[09:38.000 --> 09:48.000]  one of the top German magazines build does virus vaccine increase the risk of
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  cancer and it's grown in cancer viruses and I try to explain to people that the
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  Rockefeller's by the 20s under research they were funding discovered that most
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  cancer was viral so they set up the cancer research organizations in the
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  country one in a couple hundred people would die of cancer then by the 50s it
[10:10.000 --> 10:14.000]  was one and 33 it's now one and two it was one and three it's now one and two
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  cancers like getting a cold now and so they put the cancer viruses in the
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  vaccines they're also communicable once someone has the vaccine in them and this
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  is mainstream news but it's in the news today again and then you get cancer and
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  then they extract all of your life savings in the expensive cancer treatments
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  I mean these people are geniuses very twisted very wicked ultimately evil they
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute they funded Adolf Hitler that's encyclopedia
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  Britannica they funded all the major eugenics they fund Holdren they fund
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.000]  Ted Turner they fund Bill Gates they fund the Margaret Sanger they currently are
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  the main funders of Planned Parenthood I mean they funded all and so roll your
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  sleeve up David Rockefeller senator Rockefeller have got a prize for you
[11:04.000 --> 11:11.000]  they are they make Hitler Stalin Mao Jeffrey Dahmer look like disciples of
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  Christ and I risk my life every day telling you about them and everything I
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  can to expose these people believe me I can't deal with the fact it totally
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.000]  shakes me up every day but I don't run I flee forward and that's why I get more
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  aggressive more in their face every day and it's a response to being in the
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  battle front lines every day I mean I'm not running from them so I'm getting
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  wilder and wilder in my confrontations with them and that doesn't mean that
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  I've got all the answers are even doing a good job I'm just throwing myself at
[11:45.000 --> 11:53.000]  them you know doing the best I can it's really that simple and I look at it
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  this way I'm risking my life my name everything in this fight I might as well
[11:57.000 --> 12:06.000]  go 110% does that mean every punch I throw every kick I launch every karate
[12:06.000 --> 12:13.000]  shop to the neck of tyranny I take is gonna be thrown just right or gonna
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  strike home or gonna have the proper effect no but it means this I'm going
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  110% tooth and nail that means I'm biting I'm scratching I'm headbutt and I'm
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  ramming right into him and I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen if you just
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  research these sickos writings and what they've done and what they're doing
[12:31.000 --> 12:41.000]  you would decide to take action as well there is no other way and a lot of
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  people criticize me because at a subconscious level they are afraid of
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  fighting tyranny and in a subconscious level they're afraid of committing and
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  in a subconscious level they are threatened by someone who is a wild man
[12:54.000 --> 13:04.000]  but we all have to unloose that human spirit we all have to take action if we
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  love our families we have to break the spell or under the mesmerized
[13:08.000 --> 13:22.000]  transfer under and get it on I mean it's time it's time to stand up and speak
[13:22.000 --> 13:29.000]  out and have your voice be heard loud time the enemy hear your war growl and
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  see your war face time they know and believe me they're scared now I've
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  been really watching a lot of television to track enemy operations it is
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  torture and I'd only do it when I already see other indicators they're getting
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  ready to launch stage terror attacks because I can get more cues off actually
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  watching them than just reading the transcripts of what they read off the
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  teleprompters I get a lot from that but it adds another dimension to actually
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  watch them and I watched over an hour of television this morning and I can give
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  you a report on that here in a moment anyways let me tell you we got coming up
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  today we have the gentleman coming on it's not really a retraction but it is
[14:13.000 --> 14:20.000]  it's a clarification we said maybe a patriot out there down the road people
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  do wear guns openly and I think it's a good thing to exercise the second
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  amendment because if you don't exercise it openly and proudly you lose it and
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  I've commended people that do wear firearms openly which is legal and lawful
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  almost every state but the public's been conditioned that isn't the case so it's
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  good to break those taboos and you got incredible courage and I salute you
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  but the way Chris Matthews and others were reporting it they were acting like
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  there was somebody out there right in the crowd with Obama with a gun and I
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  said if the Secret Service allowed that this has got to be staged and then I
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  saw the earpiece and the guy was clean cut and I said that might be some
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  foundation person or some merc or who knows I said or it may be a patriot but
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  then we soon learned from Gary Franchi that he knows the fella and that he was
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  down the road at private property that was putting on a demonstration and I
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  just salute him and he's coming on the last 30 minutes today but even that
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.000]  type of bold courage even shocks me sometimes and the establishment tried to
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  use it as propaganda but this gentleman went on hardball and absolutely
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  secured Matthews because what Matthews does is he does test he loves the fact
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  that he knows a lot of history and is intelligent and so he'll sit there and
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  throw things down and if you're wrong he'll scream at you and say you're wrong
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  and he does it to politicians he did it to state senator Kirk Watson once
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  famously when Watson didn't even know one of Obama's foreign policy issues and
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  Matthews of course can look really smart he also prescripts what he's going to
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  say but this guy knew every historical issue every quote and Matthews is one
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  of these classic eugenicist elitist he suddenly got respectful and said oh
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  you're actually a human being okay well I see what you're saying okay I respect
[16:05.000 --> 16:12.000]  you it's very weird with these Georgetown elitist these it's like when they
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  figure out you know they suddenly get real nice I mean I've been around high
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  level elitist before running to him in events and they'll say a few tests to
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  you and as soon as you know facts they go oh you're it's they have really weird
[16:25.000 --> 16:33.000]  rules it's a it's a very very strange crew they actually admire those of us
[16:33.000 --> 16:42.000]  that fight them but they say you should join us the cattle are too stupid but
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.000]  see I'm not going to be a moral and sit there and feed off people I don't want
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  my children growing up in a country with a bunch of corrupt parasites that seek
[16:51.000 --> 17:00.000]  to limit human destiny and seek to limit human horizons and seek to limit the
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  dynamic human spirit I have a love affair with humanity I have a love affair
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.000]  with art and literature and beauty and goodness and innocence and I know how
[17:10.000 --> 17:26.000]  hard I am wards and all I understand that but I also know that we can reach for
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  something better and something greater and it is a great crime committed
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  against the species and humanity that the elite the controllers the engineers
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.000]  studied how our species works and would play this big this this wicked game of
[17:41.000 --> 17:48.000]  fraud and deception and dumbing down on their own people and the elites try to
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  say well we're a different group of people we're a different species we're
[17:51.000 --> 17:59.000]  almost sapien sapien super or homo sapien sapien illuminated they have
[17:59.000 --> 18:09.000]  different terms they use and if you were really homo sapien sapien illuminous as
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.000]  you say you are you wouldn't be trying to dumb people down and poison them poison
[18:15.000 --> 18:23.000]  them culturally and chemically yeah you got sunshine coming out of you but it's
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  black sunshine right out of hell all right again Steve quail coming up the
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  gentleman that went out there with the gun got their old rundist popping in

[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  in fact I need Kurt Nemo Paul Watson whoever to go get all these past articles in the last couple years
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.000]  where mainly black college students but also Jewish college students paint
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  swastikas on their dorm room and do it on their house and do it on the black
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.000]  church I mean every time it the people do this to themselves it's a false flag
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  now there are idiots it may be a meth head one toothed white supremacist idiot
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  those people certainly exist but there's not very many of me I'm a white guy in
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  Texas I used to go deer hunting and hog hunting and coyote hunting I've been
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  hunting Colorado Texas you name and I've been around the campfire with red necks
[25:46.000 --> 25:56.000]  hundreds of times never heard the n-word never people talk bad about black people
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.000]  I don't know I remember back when Jesse Jackson was running for president being at a deer camp
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  and people go on I'd vote for him he wouldn't raise my taxes and if you don't like him
[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  they say you're racist I do have a vague memory of that of people making biscuits
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  and gravy at 5 a.m. about to go out and go hunting and I do remember that I have
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  a memory of that being about 10 years old that dates me it was that long ago
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  that people like Jesse Jackson were running for president 10 12 I don't know
[26:24.000 --> 26:33.000]  something like that I was a little kid but all those old guys have been around
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.000]  the world though that was out on our property family friends hunting all those
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.000]  old World War two vets are dead most the Korean war vets were dead those were neat old
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.000]  guys to hang out with you know it's not about sitting up in a deer stand or up in
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  a deer blind bow hunting or hunting with a rifle it's about just the primitive
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  ancient right of sitting around a campfire but my issue is nine times out of 10
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  and we have written big detailed articles about I mean the Miami Herald's reported
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  about top white supremacist leaders forming and leading the white supremacist groups
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  our government agents and they came out in federal court that Hal Turner was a
[27:17.000 --> 27:21.000]  federal operative but threatened too many people so they went ahead and burned him
[27:21.000 --> 27:29.000]  which is a word to the wise all you feds out there and Jewish guys like Hal
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  Turner I mean you should really know that you're just going to get set up doing
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.000]  that kind of stuff friends with Sean Hannity that is despicable burning their
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  own operative I mean it's admitted in court records he was a fed but he threatened
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  some state judges and they filed separate state charges and they don't care
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  they went and grabbed him what a moron because those judges actually got death
[27:53.000 --> 28:02.000]  threats you idiot so I'm getting death threats now and I'm getting scores of
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  emails I mean we didn't count them probably 50 60 70 I don't know going through
[28:06.000 --> 28:17.000]  them here's one from Chanda if you I think you should be thrown in jail for
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  what you're trying to promote he is and still will be the president of the
[28:22.000 --> 28:29.000]  United States and there is nothing that your white supremacist self can do
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  about it you are a disgrace to the human race and I hope Obama puts you in
[28:34.000 --> 28:44.000]  your crew under the jail and they say this in two newscast I have in another
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  newscast it was on a Florida station I can't find it now it's off their main

[33:19.000 --> 33:23.000]  but that's perfect because the Southern Primary Law Center is savaging me and I
[33:23.000 --> 33:27.000]  it's basically Nazis doesn't matter Steve really gets criticized for being a big
[33:27.000 --> 33:31.000]  supporter of Israel these people don't care

[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  and they're going to find out that you're a liar
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  now the Southern Primary Law Center gives the orders in America
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  and even more so in the ADL I found it was Southern Primary Law Center that ran
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  and set up the Elohim City white supremacist compound that came out in
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  FBI documents released under a four year request
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  in one document they blacked out one area then in another lawsuit that a judge
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  ordered release they blocked out the other and then the Associated Press
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.000]  and the two major papers in Salt Lake City
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.000]  superimposed it and got the whole memo
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.000]  oops Southern Primary Law Center running
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  up with Tim McVeigh running
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.000]  the facility he came out of and we have the sworn deposition of
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  Larry Nichols that McVeigh was a black ops operator in
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  special forces there to set up militias in the patriot movement
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  and was set up at the end then of course heavily drugged
[35:03.000 --> 35:07.000]  Jolly and West in the MKUltra hearings in 77 was then his doctor
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  from the time he was arrested through his trial in Denver to his execution in
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  Indiana you can't make this stuff up
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.000]  it's like the LA Times reports Theodore Kaczynski was in the secret MKUltra
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  mind control program the Unabomber you can't make that up who could make that up
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  that's LA Times truth is far weirder than fiction
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  and that's why if you're in special ops and they got you following patriots around
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  and they're telling you you're going to deliver a bomb here and you're going to do that
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  there's a good chance they're going to blow it up and send you to prison for it
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  and keep you drugged up for five six years then execute you
[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  don't take part in any of these drills as a decoy
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  same thing in 77 they hire these guys we know they hired them to take part in drills
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  they put them on board those things and they got a real bombs
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  a few of them figured it out ditched the bombs got chased down in broad daylight and gunned down
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  right out Piccadilly Circus that was on the news
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  I mean they'll chase you down and kill you if you don't carry out the bombing
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  this is how black off works best movie I've seen to describe it is
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  eagle eye people kept telling me for the last year
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  few years watch that movie watch it and in that you've got a computer
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  in an NSA in the Pentagon manipulating people but
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  it's not how it works it's people doing it but they also use computers
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  and you want to see a movie of how they operate that's it
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  a lot of times they'll do a tight personality on somebody that they're controlled
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  they're focused they're professional they'll kill one of your kids and they'll call up and go
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  your 16 year old Bobby just died in that car wreck last week that wasn't an accident
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.000]  now your daughter Jenny the nine year old is going to die if you don't do exactly what I say
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  do you understand
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  now they know a lot of people will just shut down
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  freak out go crazy call the police but they typecast they know
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  these people are smart they're psych warfare black ops
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  experts they have hundred and eighty IQ's the people running this but they're
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  evil they're twisted they're twisted geniuses and it's going to take intelligent
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  people that love light and liberty to rise up and crush them
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  and expose their game now the southern
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  poverty law center when Popolski
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.000]  gunned down those three cops it's home at two thirty drunk mommy wakes him up
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  at seven a.m. his dogs are urinating everywhere he's a pit bull
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  tractor they're crapping all over the floor he throws a fit the cops get there
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  he kills one throws a fit kills two more turns out he's a white
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.000]  supremacist attacking me all over the internet southern poverty law center
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  has the computers within two hours of him in custody feeds their
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  spokesman who writes these reports about the militias and people
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  feeds their reporter saying he was a fan and that I influenced it
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.000]  turned out it was the opposite we did keyword searches proved that they had to retract
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  the first person thereafter is me now what does
[38:03.000 --> 38:07.000]  that tell you when the southern poverty law center and adl are after me
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  because they know my message and the information we're covering is devastating
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  to him because we're shattering the left-right paradigm creating unity
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.000]  now unity against the bankers not unity under
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  their agenda which is the false unity they want
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  now ladies and gentlemen I need your prayers now more than ever because
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  I told you they're going to pull another Oklahoma City and I told you you're going to start seeing
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  militia and patriot demonization and mixing it in with
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  white supremacists that are run by the feds in every case I've ever seen
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  it doesn't exist except
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  in a few small cells the guys that drink beer in their garage and play pool
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  it doesn't exist outside of federal operations in every
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  case when we have hundreds confirmed we've written articles with 30 40 50 links
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  in some cases will repost those today
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  they are now taking the Obama posters
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  and putting death to Marxist and swastikas and things
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  on it with the same image that somebody put out saying socialist we expanded
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  it saying fascist we've got to make it non-political
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  or cover both left and right fascist does that
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  see there I'm trying to unify not let them balkanize and then now
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.000]  they're going to try to and I'm getting the hate mail that I'm supposedly sending the swastikas out
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  folks this means we're hitting the enemy right in the heart when you go in against
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  the death star they're going to fire at you with their big guns okay
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  and that's what we're doing right now we are taking the flak and so the co until pro
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  is coming out of the woodwork we're going to be attacked like never before but that
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  is the blessing that means we're doing our job
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  and all these news clips

[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  i got so many of these articles i got them stacked up here in front of me
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  is that in that CNN report
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  alex jones the radio hosting conspiracy theorists got
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  wind of the plans and intervened and
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  interviewed a national guard official setting off an avalanche of angry calls and visits
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  to his website from people who feared the exercise was really about imposing a dictatorship
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  or martial law in the country tell them that any violation of your rights will result
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  in a live fire exercise one such person wrote on jones info wars
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.000]  website see that's a comment
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  they love those comments because they can't get me saying anything so they use the comments
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.000]  if they come come loaded for war
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  now remember it was in the iowa newspaper they were going to do door to door gun confiscation
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  drill it said a drill going after guns and they were going to lock the city
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  down with checkpoints the town the tiny town of seven hundred or whatever it was
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  or katia but see the way
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  they write this it's like
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  no one how bad the internet is and how we mobilize
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  and all this so this is all
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  going on i'm gonna bring up paul watson now he just wrote a big
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.000]  article on this we need to get out to everybody they don't just in these newscast
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.000]  paul say the one person in the country that put one on a
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.000]  mailbox and give me a break you see people doing that all the time but it's still on a good thing
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.000]  we told people not to do that we said do it in high traffic areas poles where
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  people hang signs okay and to check your local
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  laws that's in the contest rules and i've said it on air repeatedly but they imply that i'm out there
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  hanging it up and then they show them on poles and say it should be illegal
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.000]  and police are investigating this is amazing paul watson
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.000]  that's right alex i mean i've been tracking this for a week
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.000]  you announced the contest around a week ago and for a week
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  i mean go and search youtube there's hundreds of places where
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  people have put up these posters on light poles on
[44:43.000 --> 44:47.000]  telephone poles on trees on the roadside places like that
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  and the media didn't touch it for a week
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  even though these posters are everywhere and so as soon as somebody puts
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.000]  two posters on a mailbox it's this big
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  horror this feigned aghast reaction
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  the fact that this is vandalism and now they're
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  implying in these two news reports this florida news station which we've got
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  linked up there on prismplanet.com they're implying that it's
[45:15.000 --> 45:19.000]  basically vandalism and a criminal offense
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  to put up flyers anywhere that's the impression that they give
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  yeah i mean the reporter shows a lady pull one down on a power pole
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.000]  or off a light pole and says the police are
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  investigating this vandalism yeah and of course
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.000]  they don't care about vandalism it's got nothing to do with vandalism it's about chilling
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.000]  freedom of speech and intimidating political
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.000]  activists from going out and actually exercising their first amendment
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  rights now to them what people are doing it putting
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  up these flyers i mean the pentagon have told us what it is what
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  they classify as low level terrorism that's what they announced
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.000]  in june that there was a pentagon test and one of the answers was
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.000]  which of the following equates to low level
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.000]  terrorism the options were attacking the pentagon i.e.d
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  hate crimes against racial groups and protests
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  and the correct answer on the exam was protest so
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  to the authorities putting up flyers of a bomber as the joker
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  which people did a bush years ago the same thing
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  is to them low level terrorism so now they're trying
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  to portray anybody who exercises their first amendment right as a criminal
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  and eventually as a domestic terrorist that you've just been
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  talking about well the national media scores
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  of times a week and a half ago took
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  screenshots off the drudge report of the original obama posters in
[46:51.000 --> 46:55.000]  los angeles now he craftily last night and today
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.000]  people can go look at it right now they get a screenshot paul i don't know if you've already done that
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.000]  they posted our posters
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.000]  and called it vandalism over the swastika on the congressman
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  and i think we should check the congressman's hands for paint
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  you know the poor victim
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.000]  but or some idiot kid did this the point is is that
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  they are clearly trying to imply that putting up the posters is
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  not see i mean that's what the drudge report is doing and i guarantee you the national
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.000]  news is already reporting on this but i guarantee you if it hadn't already happened
[47:31.000 --> 47:35.000]  they are going to show a screenshot off the news of our posters with that
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.000]  swastika under it from a separate news report i mean this is how they work
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.000]  because i'm getting emails hoarding and saying how dare you white supremacist
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  do this and so it's certainly working
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  isn't it paul
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  that's right i mean the fact that you know they picked it up as soon as it went on the
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  mailbox proves that they were waiting just to exploit that one example
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  and put out this calculated editorial spin
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.000]  that's uh aimed at demonizing people who
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  question obama's anointed saintly image because the people they
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  interview in the news piece you know express their shock
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  disrespect in the president when he's poll numbers his popular
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.000]  approval is thinking faster than bush in the real world
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  nobody's falling for it anymore but they need to uphold this
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  angelic saintly image of obama to get his failing agenda
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  back on track which is why they're now coming out with yet
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  more reports saying that uh the militia
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  and patriots are going to be thinking about violence and linking
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  the militia movement with a port end of violence in the
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  coming months when as you discussed earlier the only
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  examples of violence being linked to the militia
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  or patriot movement were when the government
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  used acts of domestic terror to frame the militia movement or
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  the patriot movement as patches or indeed the patriot movement
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  and the militia were the victims you know it was the BATF that killed
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  76 people in 1993 when they burned down the branch
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  Davidian ranch killed 20 children and two pregnant women
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  it was the FBI snipers that killed Randy Weaver's wife
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  but she was holding a 10 month baby they're the ones
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  engaged in the violence and the only time militia or patriot comes into it
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  is when they're the victims or they're being framed for it
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  Paul I'm not tooting my horn
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  I just want listeners to understand we really know what we're talking about
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  I've been saying the last two weeks and throughout the weekend
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  in the last two days they're going to come out and say that anybody
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  that's against open borders gun control
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.000]  anybody who is against cap and trade
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  taxes carbon taxes anybody who's against government run health care
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  is a white supremacist murdering
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  this morning watching CNN and MSNBC
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  they had the Southern Poverty Law Center on saying
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  that the militias are going to attack and kill us and notice this was
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  already put out by the DHS report five six months
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  ago so they are prescripting all of this and I've been saying all
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  week they have got to stage terror attacks now
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  or their agenda is dead and so I've been telling people get ready for this

[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.000]  that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  it's been very fudging, fudged since day one in this election

[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  I hear the train of commas
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  it's rolling around the bend
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  and I ain't seen the sunshine
[54:13.000 --> 54:17.000]  I don't know when I'm stuck in fools in prison
[54:17.000 --> 54:20.000]  and time keeps dragging on
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.000]  but that train keeps rolling
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  on down the stand and tall
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  when I was just a baby
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  my mama told me son
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  always be a good boy
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  don't ever play with guns
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  but I shot a man in Reno
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  Paul Watson you've been with me now for I don't know
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  seven years
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  when I was a little slower
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  I hit my head
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  and your brother
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  we're almost as long
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  and the websites now
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.000]  infowars.com, prisonplot.com are
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  the first and second largest alternative sites
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.000]  does it creep you out to have the southern property law center in every case
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  come after us first
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  I mean that's got to let us know
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  we are really making them mad whenever we talk about Oklahoma City
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  it seems to be the case that increasingly
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  we're being pushed to the forefront of this demonization campaign
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  which is to be expected because
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.000]  we're the biggest thing out there in terms of
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  internet presence certainly in this movement
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  but the big breaking news on this
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.000]  which demolishes the entire foundation of
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  the DHS, the Southern Poverty Law Center's claims
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  is a freedom of information
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  act request was made by
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  Americans the limited government
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  to find out what the basis of the now infamous
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  report on right wing extremism
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  was the report that was put out by the Department of Homeland Security
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.000]  under Obama now of course
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.000]  and this was also referenced in the
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  associate press report today
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  which talked about this new Southern Poverty Law Center warning
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  about the growth of the militia movement and potential violence
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  and also linking it with gun owners
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  and then smearing them as
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  being involved with people like Richard Poploski, the Pittsburgh cop killer
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  it turns out that
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  the main source
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  of the DHS report on right wing extremism
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  the main source from which they garnered the material to write the report
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  was a website which
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  infamously, and now the vast majority of our readers
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  and the people on the forum will know how
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  ridiculous and kooky this website is
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  it infamously puts out disinformation
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  on a daily basis
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  I'm not going to give the name out just to avoid them getting any traffic
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.000]  but this website amongst its other bizarre claims
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  one is that the government of the United States
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  via sophisticated radio waves
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  has been in direct contact with extraterrestrial aliens
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  and that the United States through their scientists destroyed
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  a communication device that the Russians have got with these aliens
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  that's one of their main claims at the moment
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  and this website was the main source
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  for DHS's report on right wing extremism
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  some of their links, they've got a PDF file
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  which was used by the DHS
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  of their sources for this right wing extremism report
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  several of the links of ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center
[57:52.000 --> 57:55.000]  so it's just an echo chamber basically
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  and then no less than 11 of the links
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.000]  in which they base their entire report from this kooky
[58:02.000 --> 58:06.000]  inane website that claims that the US and the Russians
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  are fighting a war over communication with aliens
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.000]  so the entire foundation of their report is based on this bizarre kooky website
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.000]  but that's what they do
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  and then with that they say veterans are terrorist, gunners are terrorist
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  and train all the local police to take on veterans
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  Paul let's do five more minutes then we get Steve Cuellon
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  about this and a lot more and we've got those
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.000]  clips coming up once we go live at prismplina.tv
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  of all the demonization
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  we are under sustained new world order attack
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  by the government, the white supremacists, everybody right now

[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  Alex Jones
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  alright ladies and gentlemen
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  I got the southern primary law center, the ADL
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  the national media all attacking me
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  they've gone and gotten armed
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  images of Obama as a fascist
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  and they posted on the dredge report right next to
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  a swastika being painted on a congressman's
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  sign outside his local offices
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  and they admit it's two separate stories
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  but they put them right next to each other
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  knowing the idiot public will think I did this
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  and so I'm getting death threats right now
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  from just well-meaning morons
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  who think I'm a white supremacist
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  and it's just unbelievable
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  this country, I mean the way they manipulate the public
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  because they know the public doesn't even read articles
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  they just go off headline
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  so a headline will say one thing and then the article
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  says another
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  they're really upset about the listeners of this show
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  putting the ObamaInfoWars.com posters up in
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  commons areas and on power polls
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  it's totally legal and lawful
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  there might be a few towns where it's a misdemeanor
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  or something so be sure and follow your local rules
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  but everybody puts up lost cat, lost dog
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  yard sale
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  stuff
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  especially political speeches protected
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  and
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  they're on the news, we've got the clips
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  the news clips saying it should be illegal
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  it should be arrested, it's bad
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  poll wants it in closing
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  they are really coming after us right now
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  I mean I know you've been listening the last few weeks
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  I've been seeing all the pieces and saying
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  they've got to come back with that mid-1990s
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  demonization of militias and gun owners
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  and they did this in the three months before
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  the feds bombed OKC, bombed themselves
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  and
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  I just asked the feds and police
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  when your bosses kill you
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  minutes after the blast
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  remember who you saw
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  follow people, do the investigation
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  you'll be able to catch other compartments
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  of the federal government or private mercs doing it
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  it's now come out that major mercenary arms
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  were shipping arms in to the mercenaries
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  that's coming out in federal court
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  we told you they're blowing up the mosque
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  and shooting our own troops
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  they will kill you
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  this is a multi-trillion dollar business
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  this police state
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  and there is no real army or real enemy
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  so they will occasionally
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  I hope the police and military understand this
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Paul
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  the establishment is definitely
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  salivating over the prospect
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  that some nutcase
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  some 21st century
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Marina's Banda Luba
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  someone similar to the guy
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  who shot up the Holocaust Museum
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  is going to create some kind of incident
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  that they can exploit
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  to demonise everybody
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  and we know that this is now their directed agenda
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  based on the fact that this DHS report
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  which attacked gun owners
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  anti-abortion people
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  states rights people, Ron Paul supporters
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  as domestic terrorists
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  they call the alternative media
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  domestic terrorists as well
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  was based on
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  one guy doing two hours
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  clicking around on the internet
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  the main source is this Kuuk website
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  and that's the site that always says
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  that there's trillions of dollars
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  from some ambassador
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  that some woman
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  from 9-11 was alive
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  and arrested in Zurich
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  or that there are shootouts on the subway
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  in Chicago
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  it's all definitely disinfo
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  yeah, the DHS
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  did no rudimentary
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  research or investigation
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  they interviewed nobody
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  all they did was click around on some Kuuk website
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  I don't think it's Kuuk
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  I think that's done on purpose
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  then threw in some
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Southern Poverty Law Center links
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  some ADL links and that's the foundation
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  of their report it's been completely discredited
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  well they also go and find one
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  semi-threatening thing
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  on my website by a commenter
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  and they put it in there
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  as if I said it
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  I'm just gonna have to say this Southern Poverty Law Center
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  I just don't have time
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  to sue all these liars
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  I'm not a Nazi
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  I'm not a space alien
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  I don't work for the Vatican
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  I didn't see Jesus
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  sacrificed in the hologram
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  I don't believe in flying submarines
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Paul Watson great job
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  keep it up at prisonplana.com

[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  we'll be right back
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  this is Alex Jones

[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  I believe now is the time that you and your family
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  need to be armed and trained
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  to levels that exceed law enforcement
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  and military standards
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  front site provides such training
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  without any boot camp mentality

[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  go to frontsite.com
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  go to frontsite.com
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  and then
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  the feds are going to attack themselves
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  just like Hitler fire bombed his own Reichstag
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  to crack down the public and arrest people
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  instead of a police state
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  the feds did the same scripting before
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  they bombed themselves in 95
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  and that's been confirmed in FBI documents
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  now they're sworn affidavits
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  from Larry Nichols
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  they are definitely
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  coming after us
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  and every time
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  the southern probably law center opens their mouth
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  it's me
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  I'm their number one target now
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  they are coming after me, Ron Paul and Oathkeepers
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  but first Alex Jones
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  and you know why? because I know what they're doing
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  I know their ball game and it freaks them out
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  and when I keep pointing out to you
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  that we know their ball game here
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  at infowars.com and prisonplana.com
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  that's so people will pay attention
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  to what we're saying and what we're doing
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  you see the big guns of the enemy
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  going up against us we are
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  the challenge of the new world order
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  they don't want to kill me
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  because that would underline
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  everything I've said, everything I've done
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  just like the southern
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  probably law center page after page
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  demonizing me we've got it highlighted
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  let's zoom in on this
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  for prisonplana.tv viewers watching that aren't
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  just listening on the radio
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  if they kill me it'll underline my name
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  just like we've highlighted it here
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  in the southern priority law center report
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  because we know about the cancer viruses
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  in the vaccine and now we're pushing it out
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  in the mainstream news with top scientists
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  we know how to defeat them
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  we understand their ball game
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  we understand what they're doing
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  but
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  that doesn't mean they still might not set me up
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  or crush me they're very bold
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  like I'm not challenging the elite to kill me
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  I know you don't care
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  I'm just
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  laying out the facts here
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  and for most people in the government
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  most people in life this is not good for us
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  99% of us this is not good for us
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  it's less than 1%
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  that this corruption is
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  beneficial for
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  there's 6,000 super gophers
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  super managers, the elite
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Rothkopf head of the Kissinger Group
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  wrote a bestselling book last year
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  wrote articles for the Washington Post
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  world government, global carbon taxes, neo feudalism
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  6,000 elitist
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  working for less than 20 families
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  this is not my opinion
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  this is a fact
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  and all these years we warned people
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  and they laughed at us and said we were cooks
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  now it's all come true
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  our credibility is shooting up at all time highs
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  and I knew this Joker poster situation
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  well when they said
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  you're not allowed to
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  it's bad, it's racist to show Obama in a bad light
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  punch up my article that
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Paul Watson did where it shows Bush as the Joker
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Bush as a vampire
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  the article is up on
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  vandalismplanet.com
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  it's exercising first amendment
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  now vandalism is corporate media attacks
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Obama Joker contest
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Florida news station
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  attempts to chill free speech and initiate
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  intimidate political activists by claiming
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  they're putting up flyers as a criminal offense
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  and then we have
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  the flyers and news there it is with Bush
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  Bush as a vampire
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Bush as a Joker
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  the village voice itself said it's okay to show
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  Bush as a vampire but not Obama
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  by the way
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  we had a big copy of that village voice
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  poster we bought one from the village voice
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  hanging up in our office
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  the old office got lost in the move
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  or somewhere in a box but
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  we're against these puppets
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  these new order people
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  so we criticize Bush we criticize Obama
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  I make a film the Obama deception
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  and expose him as a puppet
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  but he enjoys lying to people
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  he enjoys reading off those teleprompters
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  he does make me sick but he's still just a puppet
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  and I wish him no harm
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  the establishment knows this
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  now watch the newscast look at these women
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  the looks of concern
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  you know they're talking about some gun owner getting arrested
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  they smile and say it's good but
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  if they're talking about the first amendment
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  oh it's so scary and they
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  finally got somebody somewhere to put one on a
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  post office box so they got to
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  oh federal offense and then color of law
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  blur the lines
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  they're experts at that and mix it in with
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  oh and on power polls you'll get arrested
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  don't do it anywhere but
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  in the same article we've got right here look at that
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  lost cat
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  let's punch up the actual article if we can
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  lost cat
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  professional football franchises
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  hiring
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  yard sale are they going to arrest
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  are they going to go to the yard sale and arrest them
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  see this is ridiculous
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  so hundreds
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  of people all over the world from
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  Ireland to California
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  from Texas to
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  Moscow are putting these up and they're
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  putting up Gordon Browns and putting info wars
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  dot com on it and they're putting up
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Putin's and putting info wars dot com on it
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  they're putting up I saw some Japanese
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  version with info wars
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  I can't even know who the guy is in the diet
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  the establishment is scared
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  so look at him oh it's so scary
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  doesn't matter that the Florida CPS is kidnapped
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  tens of thousands of kids and admits
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  and admit three plus thousand are missing
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  doesn't matter that Florida is totally
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  corrupt the government's collapsing and 23.7
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  trillion has been stolen
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  what matters is is this Alex Jones
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  here it is
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  as we continue
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  they're being hung all over the city of Claremont
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  have many residents outraged
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  that's because the posters look like this and whoever
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  is posting them is using anything from staples
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  to glue to do it
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  I would assume this morning's darling Jones is live
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  in Claremont and Darlene this is more than
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  a political statement it's vandalism
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  it is vandalism you can see that
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  someone had stapled the signs
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  to this utility pole stop right there
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  the residents obviously upset about this have
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  see what they did
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  see what they did yesterday is they went
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  and found one on
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  a post office box
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  and then the next day it's now
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  power poles
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  and that pole is
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  covered with nails if you look on it
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  everybody puts them up
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  I bet everybody here
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  has put a sign up for a garage sale
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  or a lost dog or cat
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  or you find a dog
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  my wife's always sees some dog wandering around
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  or some cat
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  that's got a thing around its neck but no tag
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  she'll go around and put
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  a raster it's over go into prison
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  so again this is the chilling effect
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  but people are all on this local news
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  site saying we saw stuff a bush as the devil
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  all over Florida and who didn't see
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  them you know you didn't care then
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  again these
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  the left is always worse about free speech
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  I love going after free speech
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  here it is
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  on the ground
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  the posters are on street signs
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  telephone poles and someone was bold enough
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  to put them up on mailboxes at the
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  Claremont's post office which is a federal crime
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  he looks so mean and
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  gruesome and evil and this is not
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  something that you want to as an American
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  to portray your president no matter what
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  you think you know it's that that's very
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  disrespectful the signs depict president
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  Barack Obama as the Joker or clown
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  residents have filed reports with the
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  local police and called the city demanding
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  they come down I like to know the person
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  is making all this payment to the truth
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  so they can get the least
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  part of the punishment known radio talk
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  show host and internet personality Alex
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  Jones is encouraging people to videotape
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  that pause did you hear
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  that notice they slowed it down
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  where I was blinking my eyes make me look like I'm retarded
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  when they got
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  every trick in the book going
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  where they slow it down right where I'm blinking
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  so it's like
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  Alex Jones
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  I mean you guys just
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  and then this guy says I need to be arrested
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  the guy saying do this he needs to be punished
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  this guy is even American listen to him
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  I mean why did you come to this country
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  probably because you live in a police state somewhere right
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  where there's sewage running down the street
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  when it pause on it
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  I mean you know I'm glad you're here buddy but you know
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  don't try to destroy the Bill of Rights
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  it's the only thing protecting you
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  and this woman right here she doesn't I'm not going to play
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  at all it's up on info wars
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  that we got three of them and now there's national reports
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  pouring in and
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  we do a contest we say follow the laws
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  put them up where other posters
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  are put up power poles
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  light poles downtown areas
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  where people put up other posters
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  but see they don't care if you put up your rock man
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  in your church or your lost cat
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  or your yard sale or your hiring ad
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  or you know
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  that there's a hamburger place down the street
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  they
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  only care about
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  political messages
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  and it's so mean you're not allowed to show him bad
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  no that's just our total American
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  history and our spirit
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  so now somebody's faxing them in with swastikas
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  on them and I guarantee you
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  that somebody connected to the southern
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  prairie law center or some group like that
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  I mean they've been caught over and over again
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  let's go to Steve quail Steve I got you on about the flu

[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  all these news reports demonizing myself
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  you Ron Paul countless
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  other people
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  they are really getting scared
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  right now meanwhile major
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  german publications german tv
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  german radio and bill dot d
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  one of their biggest most prestigious magazines
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  about cancer
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  viruses in the vaccine top
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  researchers I mean
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  this is getting crazy they are really
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  concerned about us Steve
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  well they are Alex and I got to share something with you
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  because I want to open
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  my sharing with your listeners with a letter
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  I got that's only a paragraph from a
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  career police officer of 35 years
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  who sent out your obama
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  deception videos to everybody he knows
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  including senators and congressmen
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  now let me read this to you Alex because this is critical
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  he said thank you
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Steve so much for the program on coast to coast
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  we're so enlightening I'm a police officer
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  and have been so for 35 years
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  everything you say is absolute truth
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  it's a shame the news media
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  is bought off and the only way you can get
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  this info is through people like
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  you and George that aren't afraid of the government
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  we have lost so many rights to citizens
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  this country it's frightening it's like the Hollywood
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  movie wild in the streets made in the
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  60s about when people get our age they are euthanized
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  here's what he says Alex I'm stockpiling
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  ammo food because I truly believe
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  when they finally take the guns away from the
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  US citizens the next thing they will do
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  is kill all law
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  enforcement officers there is
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  no doubt in my mind that we'll go through the government
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  computer bank and we'll get their names
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  addresses up all of us and destroy
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  us and our families
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  he says do not surrender their weapons
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  your weapons ever that's the only thing
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  that's keeping us around as a country
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  I sent an email the Obama deception
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  to everyone I know including two senators
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  and a congressman that I personally know
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  every citizen should email that clip
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  to their congressmen and senators
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  stay there Steve and for those that know
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  about Stalin and Mao
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  and Hitler and the East Germans
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  and Castro the first group
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  they go after is the cops
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  they kill about 30% on average
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  they put another 30-40%
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  in prison and then 20%
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  they keep on the payroll but normally
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  only a few years so the first
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  people they're going to go after after you

[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  that I think all of us would like to see
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  the Obama deception
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  completely destroys the myth that Obama
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  is working for the best interest of the American people
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  while Obama's already fudging
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  yeah fudged since day one
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  in this election if you have a demagogue
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  with a fanatical mass movement
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  the program of a group
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  of extreme bankers
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  and finance oligarchs
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  that's fascism
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  it's not about left to right
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  it's about a one world government
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  this film documents who Obama works for
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  the lies he is told
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  and his real agenda

[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  the people strike back
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  hi this is Ted Anderson
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  have you ever wondered why banks
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  stockbrokers investment advisors
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  won't talk about gold for your IRA
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  that's right
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  gold has been available to be placed in IRA
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  since 1986 yet still
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  the financial industry refuses to recognize
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  the value of real hard assets
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  for your retirement
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  the truth be told gold and silver
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  is outperform paper investments
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  like stocks, bonds and CDs
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  get no word about IRAs
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  perhaps the financial institutions
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  want to maintain control of your assets
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  by keeping you in paper
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  if you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement

[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  don't get left behind
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  by rising inflation
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  and low return on your paper investments

[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  today
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  we're gonna get into the police state
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  for cancer viruses and the vaccines
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  mainstream german news
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  we're going to cover it all
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  coming up
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  today with Steve Kwayl
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  and in the next episode
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:28.360]  And in the next hour, we're going to open the phones up for Steve Cuellet at 1-800-259-9231.
[1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:35.960]  But we're not opening them up till about 40 or 50 after. 1-800-259-9231.
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:40.200]  You can respond to anything you want to discuss. The demonization campaign against us,
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:46.120]  them coming out and saying, get ready for the militias to attack. That's your cue for the feds
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:51.800]  to bomb their own facilities. I mean, we're entering an incredible time. Steve, you're finishing up
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:56.520]  that police officer's letter. You said you have one more. I get a lot of these letters too. In fact,
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:01.800]  the guys brought me in a great one yesterday. I never got to. But yeah, people are really waking
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:07.640]  up and that's good because the police are really starting to see what's happening. Go ahead.
[1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:12.840]  Right. And Alex, I want to make it clear. The timeframe, we can't validate the fact that on
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:19.320]  the 22nd or 26th of August, there's going to be specifically a bank holiday. But when it's being
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:24.040]  talked about on multiple continents by multiple sources through multiple information sources,
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:27.320]  whether it's somebody who knows somebody, but the friend of a friend stuff isn't what I'm
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:31.960]  interested in. It's the guys who are banking and captains of banking and industry. That's
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:36.040]  what I'm concerned with. Well, talking about a bank holiday may stop it though too. Yes. Now,
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:43.560]  listen to this. Steve, this is coming from someone very well connected. Okay. Camp San Luis Obispo
[1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:49.400]  is training thousands of snipers for civilian unrest and to aid the police. I know this from
[1:25:49.400 --> 1:25:54.840]  people that are in that. I'm kind of paraphrasing this so I don't give anybody, you know,
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:26:00.920]  give them away in that sector. He said that listen to this too. He confirmed that they're
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:05.560]  training troops and that it was indeed to aid the police with the problems that the police
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:11.000]  cannot handle. He told me that he is planning on getting out of California as soon as possible.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:14.680]  Also, a friend of mine went target shooting in the National Forest last week and told me,
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:19.480]  this is in California, that the fishing game was searching vehicles and taking all weapons
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:25.400]  if ammo was present. They are out of control. A line needs to be drawn to the sand and we said,
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:29.400]  say no more and don't cross the rails. Now, let's get to the poster campaign. Look,
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:35.000]  you did not start that campaign. You reported on a campaign. Now, whoever started the Joker
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:41.160]  poster understands the value of an image and the statement that an image can make over all
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:47.560]  the arguments in the world. We saw the movie, Bee for Bandetta. The thing that I think is riling
[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:53.400]  the powers that Bee is now is that the whole country is being brought into this and I was
[1:26:53.400 --> 1:26:58.920]  listening to the news broadcast and the man saying that whoever is responsible for this listened.
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:05.560]  You did not start this campaign and the police asking whoever started it to please turn themselves
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:11.400]  in is like basically the most inane statement in the world because, Alex, let me share this
[1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:17.080]  with your listeners. I am so concerned, so worried about the next two to three weeks.
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:22.920]  Listen, ladies and gentlemen, this is not hyperbole when military is training all across
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:27.320]  the country. By the way, I'm going to stop you, Steve. This is not your opinion. I keep
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:32.680]  getting emails saying you and Steve are making this up. The Pentagon has announced that they've
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:38.440]  got Homeland Brigades for domestic ops and the governors were in the Associated Press. In fact,
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:45.080]  print that again for me on Sunday saying we don't like the Department of Defense power grab. What
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:49.960]  is this martial law and they've already threatened Congress with martial law and they're having
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:55.080]  military drills and the governor at Tennessee said stop it and the Pentagon said sit down and
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:28:00.600]  shut up. This is really going on. The time for denial is over. Yeah, and I'm going to tell you
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:04.920]  something, Alex. The difference is now we're no longer warning. We're giving up to the minute
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:10.600]  report until the time they shut you off, until the time they shut me off. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:17.400]  neither Alex Jones or I or anybody else is suicidal. So that's just total BS and I want that clear
[1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:22.680]  that the identification, billification, now you're being billified. Next step, Alex, is
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:28.600]  nullification and then destruction. But I'm saying this to all the devils that are out there, you
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:35.080]  have absolutely everything to fear from the living God and nothing to fear from the truth except the
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:40.280]  fact that you'll be exposed. And Alex, I'm telling you point blank, you don't know this, but there
[1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:45.320]  is a cadre of intercessors. I'm talking about people who really do know how to pray, who really
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:51.000]  do pray praying for your safety, my safety and our safety that people will get it. Now the shills
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:57.320]  from hell, okay, who send you those statements saying that it's our opinions. I don't spend hundreds
[1:28:57.320 --> 1:29:04.200]  of thousands of dollars like you do a year to basically go out and post my opinion. We post
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:09.560]  news stories. We post editorials. We post blogs. We detail, detail, detail. The thing that's
[1:29:09.560 --> 1:29:15.320]  different about us and the shills is the shills only watch the vomit brokers on mainstream TV or
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:20.680]  those inane lady reporters. They think somehow they've got it together. So, you know, when I
[1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:26.360]  get the emails, you and Alex are or you and me individually together, whatever the bottom line
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:32.920]  is, those are either disinformation agents or just denialists and Alex, we are now at a full-scale
[1:29:32.920 --> 1:29:38.600]  red alert. There are too many things happening. There are too many activities. Stay there. I agree
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:43.240]  with you. I mean, I've been saying get ready for him to demonize the militias. That's in
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:48.680]  preparation for stage terror attacks. Ladies and gentlemen, what are you now seeing? We are entering
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:57.320]  the vortex right now. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:29:57.320 --> 1:30:04.520]  network. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:08.680]  power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or
[1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:13.640]  triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power
[1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:18.440]  your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[1:30:18.440 --> 1:30:23.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[1:30:23.080 --> 1:30:26.920]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months
[1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:31.480]  ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year,
[1:30:31.480 --> 1:30:35.960]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar
[1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:40.520]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in
[1:30:40.520 --> 1:30:45.240]  the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can

[1:31:00.840 --> 1:31:05.560]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[1:31:05.560 --> 1:31:10.280]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[1:31:10.280 --> 1:31:16.280]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[1:31:16.280 --> 1:31:21.560]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[1:31:21.560 --> 1:31:26.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[1:31:26.200 --> 1:31:30.840]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:31:30.840 --> 1:31:36.200]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[1:31:36.200 --> 1:31:41.400]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:31:41.400 --> 1:31:46.040]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to

[1:33:22.120 --> 1:33:32.760]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid, so Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:40.760]  Take care my friends, when you go you go, death's 100%, but what lives forever is your deeds.
[1:33:41.960 --> 1:33:46.760]  And I'm just so thankful that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:49.400]  And I'm just so thankful that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:34:18.680]  And I'm just so thankful that I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:23.320]  Socialism, there it is. You see, when they came out and said it should be illegal to put these
[1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:27.320]  up and the person should be arrested a week and a half ago, I said, well, I'm going to stand up
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:31.480]  with the First Amendment. We'll put up some free flyers, ask folks to print them up, put them out.
[1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:35.640]  People said, you ought to do a contest. We said, okay, whoever puts up the most in public legal
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:41.240]  places, you'll win $1,000, second place $500, third place $200. And that contest and the rules
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:47.320]  are up on infowars.com, big banner right there. And then I started getting demonized by publications
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:52.120]  and news for it. And now they're saying I need to get arrested, not just whoever put them up in
[1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:57.000]  Florida, but I need to be arrested. And it's always some foreigner can't even speak English,
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:01.960]  saying, arrest him now. I mean, these people make me sick. Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:06.200]  next, the one to arrest you for this shirt, we've got to not give into the chilling effect.
[1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:13.240]  We've got to take action and say no to them and their system because if you don't stand up for
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:18.040]  something, you will lose it. And on the back, it's got infowars.com. There's a bunch of different
[1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:22.920]  variants. One just says infowars.com. Some say in the Fed, some of the t-shirts say wake up before
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:28.680]  it's too late or stop the criminal infowars.com. So a bunch of different variants in black and white.
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:34.040]  They say fascist. They say infowars.com. They say new world order. They say socialism. You know,
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:40.600]  whatever your view is, all these are bad isms. We've got the shirts, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:45.640]  And we do tell folks that like we've been saying from the start, be sure you put this in areas
[1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:50.760]  that are legal and lawful to post them. According to this Florida town, you can't put it on a
[1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:56.440]  power pole. You can put a lost cat up. You can put a yard sale up. You don't put something on
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:01.800]  flattering. That is illegal. Worshiping the president is the only way our veterans have
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:06.920]  fought and died so that you don't have free speech. But again, and then there's all the
[1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:12.520]  films. You can also get an infowars.com, not just the t-shirts, dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove,
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:18.840]  generation rx about the drugging of the kids end game, ol eugenics plan, anthrax war about the
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:23.960]  race specific bio weapons, the Obama deception that you heard Steve quell talking about. Get them
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:28.680]  all at infowars.com or watch them in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. And we even have
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:35.080]  the evil Gadsden flag. Don't try it on me with infowars.com on the back. The establishment really
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:41.240]  hates this. And this is how we fund our operation to continue standing up against the new world
[1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:45.800]  order. Speaking of supporting people, folks need to support Steve quail is website is
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:49.720]  Steve quail.com. Just Google Steve quail bestselling author and researcher will tell you
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:54.120]  about those before he leaves us. Okay, enough of my interruption, Steve. I want to take calls
[1:36:54.120 --> 1:36:58.920]  in the next hour when you're on with us continuing when you're saying the next few weeks, next few
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:05.720]  months, red alert, he's losing a couple of percentage points a week. I heard a rebroadcast.
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:11.400]  I said a day. I say things wrong sometimes, but always corrected. He's gone from 80 plus points,
[1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:15.960]  slowly dropping the last two weeks, losing two or three points a week. Most polls show him in the
[1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:23.400]  mid to low 40s. The ones they throw around say 50 49 Gallup, Rasmussen shows below 50.
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:29.320]  What are they going to do? I mean, he's a puppet, but he's the puppet. They've got their whole agenda
[1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:37.560]  behind. So I see them having to stage a terror attack or a shooting or something to demonize
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:43.400]  these grassroots people that are coming and, you know, they open up the doors and 95% of people
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:47.320]  are booing and screaming and saying, I'm not partisan. I wasn't paid to come here. I don't
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:52.600]  want cap and trade. I don't want socialist health care. Obama's lying. He's been caught lying about
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:58.600]  what's in the bill. People have gone over that now. I mean, I see a total loss like I've never seen
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:05.240]  of confidence in this criminal and his controllers. And that's why I see them now. I knew they were
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:09.560]  going to have to come out and say militias and gun owners are going to kill you. The DHS report
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:16.360]  is real. The veterans are evil. Now they're saying that the veterans are white supremacists and are
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:21.560]  going to bomb federal buildings. They did that last time before they bomb themselves. So that's
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:26.680]  why I see us going into total red alert. Steve Coyle. Well, we are at red alert, Alex. And
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:31.640]  the things that lend me to believe that or lead me to believe that is the fact of paratrooper
[1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:37.160]  paratroop drops in the rain north of Cincinnati, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Louisiana, WAF,
[1:38:37.160 --> 1:38:42.760]  Beach Channel 9, talking about the parachute drops. I mean, not only that, but I'm getting
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:50.760]  reports from Indian depth town, the base up in Pennsylvania about just massive. I'm talking
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:57.320]  massive. They're training 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Foreigners of the last group in
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:39:02.040]  there was from Chile. And guess what? They're training them all and going house to house,
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:08.680]  take away the guns. Now I want to share something with everyone. I am so absolutely in a period of
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:15.400]  turmoil because when I say this, you can no longer just go by the information, waiting for more
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:19.400]  information, information. You've got to get prepared. And I'm telling everybody I know,
[1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:24.440]  Alex, I dealt most of yesterday with people telling me they've got to get out of where they're at.
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:30.120]  I'm telling people that they better start moving now. If you live east of the Mississippi,
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:34.520]  you should be looking at a mountain places where maybe some old tourist hotels, when I say old,
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:39.800]  tourist hotels that are unoccupied during the fall, go in the winter, go up and rent a place,
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:43.800]  but get out of where you're at if especially you've got high visibility. I can tell you this,
[1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:49.000]  the veterans that have heeded my warning, and there are certain things I don't say publicly,
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:54.200]  that they know that can be validated through their own channels. A lot of them have already left
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:59.640]  the country. I will tell your listeners this. Now look, it's not what I pretend to know. It's
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:05.000]  that people who do know, let me know when I'm on because contrary to popular belief, there are still
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:10.360]  some great people out there that are fighting behind the scenes and dying behind the scenes
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:14.680]  to basically bring the information to the public. There has been a war declared on the
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:19.480]  intelligence community of years ago, especially those that still believe in the Constitution,
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:23.960]  still believe in their oath, and the Constitution now is billified. In these town hall meetings,
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:27.800]  you cannot bring up the Constitution. You bring up the Constitution, that's a one-way ticket out
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:31.960]  of a meeting usually by pretty burly thugs. You can count on leadership. And by the way,
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:37.000]  we're seeing them beat up women, beat up men, beat up blacks that are against Obama because
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:40.920]  they really don't like that image. They want to make it that it's all racist to divide us.
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:47.240]  This grabbing old man was on TV with Specter and then saying that we're the ones doing it,
[1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:51.880]  when on video, it's them. Well, I think that people have got to understand something.
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:58.200]  They control the images. They control the speech. That's why they hate free speech because see,
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:04.360]  Alex, what's happening now, people have finally been able to say, look it, I no longer have a job.
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:10.600]  I no longer have my 401k IRA where I used to have enough money to retire on. And now I'm being told,
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:15.640]  I may get to die at 65 because of a health panel. And by the way, it's interesting, isn't it,
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:20.200]  that even they- Those death panels are in there. I've got videos. We've played them
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:26.360]  of Rahm Emanuel's brother saying that he's a bioethicist board. They say in the documents
[1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:31.160]  that they're going to ration care. Well, and again, ration care, that's eugenics,
[1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:35.640]  my brother. That is absolutely what's going on. And by the way, they hate that word. See,
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:41.560]  they accuse anybody who says, look what they're doing is being Nazis. And I can say, by the way,
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:49.320]  your wording is out of a direct speech given by Dr. Mengele in one case it was. So when I see these
[1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:54.600]  people saying that anybody who is contesting there, do what we say, not as we do. Oh, okay,
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:59.000]  will you take the health care provisions offered even the president himself wouldn't answer that
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:04.600]  question? So you see, the elitist and the socialist, let's just get through that socialist word,
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:11.160]  the communists, the Luciferians are absolutely livid to that their plan to implement this cannot
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:17.080]  be done as quickly or as seamlessly as they thought. That's why you've got the U.S. military
[1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:22.200]  preparing for total civil uprising. That's why you've got thousands of tripers, excuse me, snipers
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:28.840]  being trained at San Luis Obispo for the eventual uprising. That's why the local police are being
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:34.520]  told that Vietnam veterans and all veterans are potential terrorists, that people that
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:39.880]  got quote the Constitution Bill of Rights. How dare we? Well, listen, we dare. And what we're
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:44.760]  trying to do is save your rear ends in the whole battle. Because let me share this, Alex, it is
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:53.080]  a given that once the powers of B have to utilize local law enforcement, National Guard, and willing
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:57.400]  military, they all die too. And that's what we're fighting for. You see, we're trying to not only
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:03.160]  fight evil against those who are coming against everything that freedom is based on, but we're
[1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:07.000]  also trying to protect their families. And like the law enforcement officer who sent me that
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:12.920]  letter stated, he knows 35 year veteran in law enforcement that they're going to use his family
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:20.840]  first of all as a hostage and then basically they're in the targets too. It's problematic. It's
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:27.720]  absolutely astonishing to me that most people do not get the fact of the lateness of the hour.
[1:43:27.720 --> 1:43:32.040]  I get e-mails right now while I'm on the air with you. Are you going to put up your red screen?
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:37.800]  My red screen will simply say, it is time to head to the hills. This thing is on. Go for it. Do I
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:42.040]  know that they'll keep the internet up? No. And again, what I'm trying to do, Alex, is just,
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:48.600]  see, the difference is, is that there is no, when I say this, there is no hope of turning it around
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:54.520]  in my eyes. There is a hope of getting people to recognize that they need to turn and repent. See,
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:59.720]  across the land, there is not one voice, maybe one or couple, saying that people need to repent
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:04.680]  this land. If people would repent, turn back to God, then things could be different, but I don't
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:10.200]  see that. And see the deal is that just with standing the new world order, you cannot stand
[1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:15.800]  against a supernatural force in human force. It cannot be done. Well, Steve, Steve, you're right,
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:20.920]  but in every other nation, tyrants take over and they do this and they really are building
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:26.520]  FEMA camps. They really are admitting North comms to take over the governors. I really do have the
[1:44:26.520 --> 1:44:34.280]  Hill and the Associated Press governors opposed DOD emergency powers. A bipartisan pair of governors
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:39.480]  is opposing a new Defense Department proposal to handle natural and terrorism related disasters,
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:43.720]  contending that a murky chain of command can lead to more problems than solutions.
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:49.880]  But they're really whitewashing this. It's well, they're watching it. Look, the deal is that we
[1:44:49.880 --> 1:44:54.760]  we're all hearing. And when I say we're all hearing, your sources are different than mine.
[1:44:54.760 --> 1:44:58.920]  People feed you, feed me, but there are people that I know that you've never met in vice versa,
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:03.080]  or just people that are anonymous. Well, it's not even that. They're openly announcing
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:07.880]  that the main target is the governors in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:13.000]  I agree. But you see, Alex, when you and I say that, even though you put it up on your info or
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:17.800]  put it up on your info wars.com site, I put up on Steve Quayle.com. It doesn't matter if George
[1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:23.880]  Norrie has you or I or anybody on. It's that the people that absolutely go to work from nine to
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:29.720]  five or basically looking for a job from nine to five are not getting the true news because
[1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:34.360]  that's why they're putting the full court press on to vilify. And what I'm saying is there's no
[1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:39.880]  doubt the feds are trying to take over, but this is not Russia, Zara's Russia, or, you know,
[1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:45.480]  the poor peasant, you know, Chinese culture, people, but they'd always been slaves. This isn't
[1:45:45.480 --> 1:45:50.600]  this Soviet takeover. And that's what it's more akin to isn't going to work with all these guns.
[1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:56.120]  And I see their whole agenda stalling. I see them staging terror attacks just to maintain
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:46:00.680]  and hold on, Steve. You're saying you really think they're going to still go for a hot war?
[1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:06.840]  Absolutely. Absolutely. They're going for it. Absolutely. Because, look, Alex, you don't start
[1:46:06.840 --> 1:46:12.840]  killing generals in the national security agency and for the people that are not aware, they have
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:17.640]  a military hierarchy in the NSA. You don't start killing them when those are some of them break
[1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:22.280]  ranks and say, look, we're not going to partake in the death of 25 to 50 million Americans.
[1:46:22.280 --> 1:46:26.440]  We're, you know, it's interesting, isn't Henry Kissinger's an old guy, but he said basically
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:30.840]  old people have got to go. In other words, they've got to be put away. Listen, these are Kissinger
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:36.280]  quotes. You could do a whole show on nothing but quotes of the elitists and still people would say,
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:39.960]  well, gee, I don't know if they're really serious. Yeah, Obama this morning got up with
[1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:45.240]  Sotomayor and lied and said, you know, there's, there's, there's nothing in there to restrict
[1:46:45.240 --> 1:46:50.120]  your health care when it's in there. Right. Well, forgive me, but I doubt he's read it.
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:54.920]  And I forget. And then based on, you know, some of the statements coming out of the senators and
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:47:00.280]  congressmen who have voted for it, they, they are, they have passed it in whatever level of the house.
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:06.200]  The bottom line is that just it still behooves them to read it. And I think that Arlen Specter
[1:47:06.200 --> 1:47:11.800]  making the statement that people who are showing up these meetings don't represent mainstream America.
[1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:16.280]  That's the biggest mistake they made. The military knows good and well they represent
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:21.560]  mainstream America, but it's the illusion of the politicians that have been bought and have been
[1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:26.120]  basically compromise. Look, it's simple. A bunch of offshore banks came in, took over their
[1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:31.400]  philosophies, eugenics. That's their excuse to do what they do. The very banks funded Hitler,
[1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:36.920]  Stalin, Mao on record. I've had top historians on it's a historical fact. Carol Quigley,
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:43.160]  Georgetown's political science head, Bill Clinton's mentor, wrote for the State Department of CIA,
[1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:50.680]  a true history from the 1920s to 1968 called Tragedy and Hope, Rothkopf writes books,
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:56.600]  Rockefeller writes books. They all brag. And I want the military and police that aren't awake yet
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:00.920]  and the public to know you can differ about when they're going to launch it or what's going to
[1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:07.480]  happen or what's going to go on. The globalists have said they want a hot revolution. They want
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:12.120]  to kill people. They want to line people up and shoot them. They want to have all their stupid
[1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:17.480]  fluoride head guys in uniforms, you know, their youth brigades running around. You cannot make
[1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:22.120]  the magnitude of this up. It's happened everywhere else. They want to do it here. And listen,
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:27.560]  this is real. They really want to do this. They really have passed a hate bill to restrict free
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:32.280]  speech. They really are trying to pass the cyber bullying act that says if you hurt their feelings,
[1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:38.200]  you're arrested. They really are building FEMA camps. And Steve Quail, I want to shift gear to
[1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:42.440]  the flu because the only thing I think they can launch in October, November, that will give them
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:48.440]  the cover they need on top of blowing up federal buildings and blaming on us, the only thing they
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:54.760]  can do to be able to get this through is going to be the flu. And they're saying we're at level
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:59.880]  six. They're saying forced inoculations. They're saying the army is going to forcibly inject us.
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:06.120]  I then get emails saying I'm making it up saying this. I'm reporting CNN, Fox, ABC. We've played
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:11.560]  the clips, but because I don't say it's all wonderful, then I'm the one reporting all this.
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:16.680]  No, I don't know. I want to share something, Alex. I spent a good, pretty much the better part of
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:22.840]  last decade, okay, 10 years basically cataloging, investigating, researching the death of the leading
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:29.400]  bio-weaponers and the molecular biologists, immunologists, and the virologists. And 100
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:34.520]  reasons why you should believe that what we're saying is true, the dead who's who in the world
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:39.480]  of bioengineering, David Kelly's death in itself, head of port and down, Ministry of Defense, British
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:45.720]  Ministry of Defense. And by the way, the thing is, is that this is a virus shedding vaccine. How is
[1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:50.840]  it that it just seems to come along at the same time as an international financial disaster?
[1:49:50.840 --> 1:49:56.600]  There's no doubt we've been telling people that these cloned viruses are connected in with these
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:50:01.720]  companies that are killing people in secret trials. Then we put the London Telegraph up,
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:06.760]  how they're giving it to homeless people and it's, they'll give it to 100 and 23 will die.
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:12.680]  I mean, you can't make up a death toll like that. And then you read, in fact, let's get to this now
[1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:18.040]  and we come back. Well, we'll finish your point and I'm going to get to this. This, the German press
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:23.480]  is reporting this. I mean, my God, they're going to inject us with weaponized cancer virus.
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:28.520]  Go ahead. Yeah, the thing that people have got to understand is this is that,
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:32.600]  look, everything I'm saying, I back it up, everything you're saying, you back it up. But
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:38.200]  even when we use their sources and they criticize the messenger, the ad hominid attack is absolute
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:42.120]  prima facie evidence. They cannot attack the information they have to attack the messenger.
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:46.680]  Well, I just want everybody listening to me. Do you have some golden ticket from the elite to
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:53.640]  get out of all this? I mean, we're all together. I mean, there's 6,000 elitist according to the
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:58.120]  head of the Kissinger group. That's all. If you're not part of that 6,000 folks, you should stand
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:03.720]  with humanity. Don't say you haven't been warned. Millions of Americans are beginning to realize
[1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:08.120]  the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S. and the world. And for
[1:51:08.120 --> 1:51:12.760]  the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness. Ready reserve foods

[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:11.880]  spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as
[1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:18.680]  strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:24.200]  for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day
[1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:29.640]  one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:36.920]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:42.120]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who
[1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:49.320]  Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception

[1:52:55.640 --> 1:53:03.080]  The Obama deception. The people strike back. Heart-related health problems affect millions of
[1:53:03.080 --> 1:53:08.120]  people each year. Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain.
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:13.080]  High blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat,
[1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:18.360]  or clondardaries. There is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only
[1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:23.000]  mask the problem and leave you with horrible side effects. Doctors who have tried heart and
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:28.360]  body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as well. Here's what Dr. Goodman
[1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:33.240]  has to say about his experience with the product. If you notice that most times here at these drug
[1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:37.640]  ads on TV, they have a list of possible side effects, I find that if you're going to take
[1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:42.360]  something that is you're trading one problem for five or six other problems, that to me doesn't
[1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:47.480]  make sense. Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body, particularly because
[1:53:47.480 --> 1:53:52.200]  in a liquid form, I think is the best way to go. Call to order your two-month supply of heart and
[1:53:52.200 --> 1:53:59.800]  body extract today. Call 1-866-295-5305 or go to hbextract.com.
[1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:30.200]  With the artist who did the famous street art, Andre the Giant has a posse,
[1:54:31.400 --> 1:54:35.400]  and then everybody copied that around the country in the world tens of millions of times.
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:40.440]  Then they came out with obey clothing line. People called him a sellout, but get your political
[1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:44.840]  message out. Unfortunately, it's like communist. It's a communist that makes tens of millions of
[1:54:44.840 --> 1:54:49.640]  dollars and has clothing shops, but that's actually David Rockefeller, his granddad,
[1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:56.920]  he said, competition's a sin, but that's a side issue. We're happy he's making money.
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:55:01.560]  The issue is he just shouldn't then want to put us in FEMA camps, but the guy that made the obey
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:05.720]  signs is the one that made the famous archetypal image of change.
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:12.600]  And then Barack Obama sent him a thank you letter. Dear Shepherd, I would like to thank you for
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:17.480]  using your talent and support of my campaign. The political message involved in your work have
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:22.920]  encouraged Americans to believe they can help change the status quo. Your image has a profound
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:29.880]  effect on people whether seen in a gallery or on a stop sign. Oh, Obama wants them to put his
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:35.960]  image on stop signs, which they were. In fact, that's what we do. We write articles showing Obama
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:42.120]  stuff and Obama stickers on stop signs. And I've even seen them on mailboxes and we show that.
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:46.040]  So, oh, these criminals are just incredible. See, they want their speech, but they don't
[1:55:46.040 --> 1:55:50.920]  want you having yours or on a stop sign. I am privileged to be part of your artwork and proud
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:56.760]  to have your support. I wish you continued success. Barack Obama signed by Barack Obama.
[1:55:57.560 --> 1:56:03.080]  They are just such hypocrites with all these newscasts and Drudge post the posters we put out
[1:56:03.080 --> 1:56:08.600]  with info wars.com. The Joker are variant of it. It's gone viral with our audience taking action.
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:14.680]  We commend you. And they put it next to a swastika that wasn't part of our image. They're trying to
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:19.240]  set us up, folks. The Southern Laugherty, probably law center hit us this morning and hit us hard.
[1:56:19.240 --> 1:56:25.320]  The AP hit us. They're coming after us. You know why? Mainly because we're talking about this.
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:31.480]  Now, this is on German TV, German radio. We have the reports up on info wars.com.
[1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:35.640]  Does virus vaccine increase the risk of cancer? Then they go on to admit
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:38.920]  cancer viruses. We're going to talk to Steve Cuell right now about this.
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:43.720]  The swine flu vaccine has been hit by a new cancer fears after a German health expert.
[1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:50.120]  They have a shock warning about the safety. Lung specialist Wolfgang Waterig, I want him on,
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:54.840]  has said that there are many risk associated with the vaccine for the H1N1 virus. See,
[1:56:54.840 --> 1:57:00.280]  these new advanced genetically engineered viruses are really nanotech folks. They're very
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:05.720]  the new generations like the Gardasil, all those girls it's killing. Just Google Gardasil death.
[1:57:05.720 --> 1:57:10.680]  And you'll just you'll watch him blood pouring out everything. I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:18.120]  He has grave reservations about the firm Novartis, who they're really scary folks,
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:21.960]  scarier than Baxter, who are developing the vaccine and testing it in Germany.
[1:57:21.960 --> 1:57:24.360]  The vaccination is injected with a very hot needle.
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:31.960]  Woodard said the nutrient solution for the vaccine consists of cancerous cells from animals,
[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:34.360]  and we do not know if there could be an allergic reaction.
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:41.160]  Yeah, we know from the 1920s research the Rockefellers funded, we know what's in it.
[1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:44.760]  Just like Bayer knew that what that HIV and hepatitis would do in factor eight.
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:50.440]  They came out in their own documents. They did it on purpose. Why would you do that?
[1:57:50.440 --> 1:57:55.320]  Because they're psychos folks. But more importantly, some people fear that the risk of
[1:57:55.320 --> 1:58:00.120]  cancer could be increased by detecting the cells. The vaccine as Johannes lower,
[1:58:00.120 --> 1:58:06.040]  president of the Paul Ehrlich Institute has pointed out can also cause worse side effects
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:11.400]  than the actual swine flu virus. That's the plan. We've got one minute before we go to break, but
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:17.560]  Steve, Steve Quayle, I mean, this is exactly what you and others have been saying.
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:22.120]  Well, again, no one's been saying it longer than I have in the Spanish flu being
[1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:28.120]  recultured and brought into the equation. It's not each one in one. That's the issue.
[1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:33.800]  It's not even swine flu. It's the biological cocktail that these guys have concocted
[1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:38.440]  to destroy 5.5 billion people. By the way, they have a...
[1:58:38.440 --> 1:58:40.040]  Stay there. Stay there. I'm not getting one minute.
[1:58:42.280 --> 1:58:47.800]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:50.440 --> 1:58:54.680]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:59.880]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[1:58:59.880 --> 1:59:05.240]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:09.640]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[1:59:09.640 --> 1:59:14.520]  system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water
[1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:19.160]  Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[1:59:19.160 --> 1:59:23.960]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:59:23.960 --> 1:59:28.680]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light
[1:59:28.680 --> 1:59:34.600]  sterilization techniques. That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe. Order today

[2:00:05.320 --> 2:00:12.680]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:12.680 --> 2:00:21.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.520 --> 2:00:30.840]  The internet was not really going in 95-96. There were a few audio screens that they were
[2:00:30.840 --> 2:00:35.720]  intermittent. I didn't hear a Steve Quayle till 96 when I said an audio cassette of him.
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:40.600]  Then I got him on. And I remember the first interview, I kind of disagreed with him on a
[2:00:40.600 --> 2:00:44.520]  lot of points. He said they're going to carry out eugenics. They're going to put it in a flu
[2:00:44.520 --> 2:00:49.480]  vaccine. They're going to kill you. And then years later, I've done deep, deep research,
[2:00:49.480 --> 2:00:54.200]  made films. I realize that's everything. That's why I respect Steve. That's what kind of scares
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:00:58.200]  me, though. It gets into other areas that I haven't really researched enough, but I know he's
[2:00:58.200 --> 2:01:02.440]  a credible guy. So it kind of freaks me out some of the other stuff he covers because I hope that
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:07.880]  is inaccurate. But we know that Steve is very gifted, very intelligent, has a lot of sources,
[2:01:07.880 --> 2:01:11.000]  and it's always great to have Steve Quayle on with us. Okay, Steve, you got cut off by the break.
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:18.440]  Top German scientists, major institutes, live cancer virus. We know the cancer,
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:24.680]  the weaponized cancer program was the name of the AIDS program by the Navy in the 70s. We know
[2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:31.480]  they put it in the vaccines of gay men in New York. That's declassified. But then we get demonized
[2:01:31.480 --> 2:01:37.160]  saying don't take the shots. And now here it is in mainstream news that these people are going to
[2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:41.960]  be getting cancer viruses. Go ahead. Okay, first of all, I want to give two quotes because I didn't
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:49.800]  say this. Dr. Henry Christinger, world population needs to be decreased by 50%, okay? War and famine
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:53.960]  would not do instead. Disease offered the most efficient and fastest way to kill the billions
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:59.400]  that must soon die if the population crisis is to be solved. AIDS is not an efficient killer
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:05.560]  because it's too slow. My favorite candidate for eliminating 90% of the world's population
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:11.320]  is airborne Ebola, Ebola-resting, because it's both highly lethal and it kills in days instead
[2:02:11.320 --> 2:02:19.160]  of years. We've got airborne diseases with 90% mortality in humans killing humans. Think about
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:22.760]  that. You know, the bird's poo is good too. For everyone who survives, he will have to very
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:30.440]  nine. That's Dr. Eric Pionka, University of Texas evolutionary ecologist and loser expert.
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:35.560]  Okay? Now, Alex, what I've been trying to get across for the decade and a half I've been on talk
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:42.840]  radio is the fact that, look, they're not happy with the 28% mortality rate. They want the 90%
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:49.720]  mortality rate. The idea is still in strange language or in language that seems so hard for
[2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:54.920]  people to grasp, but the world's leaders who everybody looks up to at the CFR and all that,
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:02:59.480]  I don't even want to go into that, but if these guys are you, Genesis at heart, which they are,
[2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:04.840]  if they're making statements that everyone's got to die, which they do, then where are you and I
[2:03:04.840 --> 2:03:10.600]  off? And I challenge the mainstream media to have a round table. Exactly. I mean, here's the deal.
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:15.720]  Don't these stupid reporters in New York on CNN and Fox, don't these FBI guys, don't you all
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:22.520]  understand? We're telling you the truth. We wish this wasn't true. Believe me, I don't like working
[2:03:22.520 --> 2:03:27.640]  18 hours a day. I'm sick of this, but I can't get out of this because it's real. Don't you
[2:03:27.640 --> 2:03:35.560]  understand that we're not kooks? It's all coming true. It's real mainstream German news, cancer
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:41.400]  viruses in the shots. Sorry. And you know, no, the thing that people have got to understand,
[2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:48.120]  those who are in the FBI, the DHS, the CIA, DIA, DEA, every four letter and whatever letters
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:53.880]  are out there, this isn't just about your assigned target for the day, Alex Jones, Steve
[2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:59.800]  Poehler, whatever. This is about your families because of mutagenic nature of these very
[2:03:59.800 --> 2:04:05.160]  biologically. And by the way, this is all done in special compartmentalized intelligence,
[2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:10.360]  and A doesn't necessarily know how he's connected to B until he sees all the killing. That's why
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:16.760]  the hundred scientists had to die. Alex, listen to me. Right now, they're going to go hot,
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:21.320]  mean going hot. I know you and I probably, if there's any place we disagree on is the
[2:04:21.320 --> 2:04:26.360]  lateness of the hour. Okay. And when I say disagree, no, Steve, I mean, I mean, I mean,
[2:04:26.360 --> 2:04:32.040]  sir, I just believe we can stop it. I know. And I would say this, that their powers that B
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:38.760]  are anticipating at the intentional release of the most deadly biological pathogens. I don't know
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:43.560]  if the first series of injections stay there. Stay there. You're saying the intel you've got
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:49.240]  is they're going hot. We'll see when we'll get back the word we've got. So October,
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:52.600]  but if we get the word out, I believe they will take the green light off.
[2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:57.640]  We better hope so. And a lot of you are laughing out there. Later, you may not be laughing.
[2:05:00.360 --> 2:05:05.720]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[2:05:05.720 --> 2:05:10.280]  Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[2:05:10.280 --> 2:05:15.400]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[2:06:00.680 --> 2:06:05.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:09.960]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:06:09.960 --> 2:06:15.240]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:20.360]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:25.240]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:29.320]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[2:06:29.320 --> 2:06:33.480]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[2:06:33.480 --> 2:06:38.520]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[2:06:38.520 --> 2:06:43.000]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:49.800]  Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:08:22.200 --> 2:08:31.480]  But we are going to your phone calls in just one moment. Steve Quill is our guest. SteveQuill.com.
[2:08:31.480 --> 2:08:36.840]  My left is, of course, the prison one.TV and info.com. We're in the national media attack
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:46.920]  right now. Southern Prairie Law Center attack. The key to all of this is to understand that
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:54.920]  only a bio-weapon release serves the purpose of making everyone suspect and the pretext
[2:08:54.920 --> 2:08:59.800]  to lock down cities, bring in federal troops, so they can then pose as the saviors, set the
[2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:04.120]  precedent, make the troops feel like it's okay what they're doing, make the cities feel like
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:08.760]  it's okay what they're doing. A total economic collapse can do that, but still the feds get
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:14.200]  blamed even though they play the part of the savior. So the globalists are all about scripting
[2:09:14.200 --> 2:09:20.600]  and how to pose as the savior. And we see them, I said back in January and February, I said,
[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:24.680]  I'm looking for them to release a controlled flu, but not that the flu would be real.
[2:09:25.880 --> 2:09:30.520]  We said back in April, we don't know if this is real or not or just hype. A lot of scientists
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:34.360]  are saying this is no big deal. Some, like Nyman, we've had on, do say it's a big deal.
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:37.720]  Steve's been saying it's going to be the vaccine that's going to have it.
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:42.440]  And a lot of scientists are saying and they're admitting it has live cancer viruses in it.
[2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:50.360]  Can cancer cells? So we were just reporting on that. Steve, finish up what you were trying to say.
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:56.520]  I'm simply trying to say is that everything you were talking about,
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:10:00.120]  you believe that they won't give it the green light. I'm telling you they've given it the green
[2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:04.760]  light. Now let me just have a minute to tell people why. Okay. The thing is they would not
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:09.160]  be deploying the military to the extent they have. They would not have GPS gun owners to the
[2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:13.640]  extent they have the reports that I'm coming in. And when I say this, I'm talking eyewitness
[2:10:13.640 --> 2:10:19.720]  listeners of yours in mind, Cobra helicopter gunships over state college last week, 810
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:25.000]  Warthogs flying low over Cincinnati Metro suburban neighborhood. No, no, they admit under NLE09,
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  14 other countries to take over America. And I mean, that's all admitted. I'm not saying it
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:35.800]  hasn't been green lighted, but we know there's an operation going. The question is, what is the
[2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:40.920]  operation and will they fully carry it out? I agree. They're moving the assets into place.
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:46.040]  I'm seeing the pre-preparation propaganda. I agree with you. I'm just saying if we stand up and
[2:10:46.040 --> 2:10:51.080]  expose it, won't they have to back down or you're saying they can't pull out? I'm saying this because
[2:10:51.080 --> 2:10:54.920]  of the commitment of all the foreign troops and everything. I don't believe outside. Now let me
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:11:00.040]  make this clear. I am the one who believes in miracles. I have said it and I believe, I seriously
[2:11:00.040 --> 2:11:05.480]  believe Alex if I'm not people will repent and I don't know that it can stop it. But my issue
[2:11:05.480 --> 2:11:09.320]  is this for everyone. Just like you, you have listeners, I have listeners, we have listeners.
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:14.200]  Coast to coast has all the listeners. I mean, you know, additional listeners, a lot of them. But
[2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:19.400]  I'm saying this is, look, the thing that's left out the equation in my opinion, and because it is
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:25.640]  a spiritual battle, because these people openly worship Lucifer, having Luciferian human sacrifices,
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:31.320]  I would say this, do you really think that there is a position in all this argument between all
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:36.760]  of us and all of them that the God of heaven, which America used to worship, acknowledge,
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:43.880]  and be grateful for, has a specific character's statement or a reflection in the Bible where
[2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:49.960]  he judges simple and wicked nations. And he uses evil people to take out other evil people.
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:56.440]  So my statement is this, is in this equation there, you have to factor and you know you get
[2:11:56.440 --> 2:12:01.240]  nailed with emails, quails talking about God again. Well, I'm sharing this with people. If
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:06.920]  everyone's dying of a vaccine and by simply recognizing the fact that number one, they don't
[2:12:06.920 --> 2:12:12.280]  have to take it. Number two, that with sorting all this stuff out, there's so many voices out there,
[2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:16.120]  if they will turn, with what repentance is and a simple word saying, God, I'm sorry, I've tried
[2:12:16.120 --> 2:12:20.600]  to live my life without you. You know, Alex, you're saying, you just quoted a minute ago,
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:25.400]  that you're going to live in the house of Lord forever. Yeah, but others need to know this too,
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:29.640]  that God's abiding presence will never, Jesus said he'll never leave us for sake,
[2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:34.520]  it's okay. But the point is, is that these people that worship Lucifer want us dead.
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:41.000]  I do not believe short of repentance on the level of Nineveh, that this thing can be stopped because
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:47.240]  the assets, and you know this, you sit it on the air, you know, where our families are threatened
[2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:52.440]  incessantly, we're threatened incessantly, we've got spooks on us night and day. And the deal is,
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:58.280]  is that they would not be doing that, assigning 1000 cyber warriors to try and come after you,
[2:12:58.280 --> 2:13:04.040]  come after me, if they weren't worried about the one thing that they cannot control. And that's
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:09.080]  God and God is simple. Well, I agree with you, and I have a personal relationship with the creator.
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:13.400]  My issue is, they've created this counterfeit church, so when you get into it, people then get
[2:13:13.400 --> 2:13:18.600]  pushed into the new older system, but you explain that. But even if somebody's an atheist, we have
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:24.760]  to admit we're screwed up, and admit we're bad, and admit this is a sick society, and admit that
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:29.640]  we've got to change our ways, or it's only going to get worse. Things are deteriorating. Things
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:35.640]  are getting evil. Things are falling apart, and it is because we've turned into wicked devils,
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:43.320]  and the elite know there is a God, and they worship the wicked creation of the creator,
[2:13:43.320 --> 2:13:47.560]  and they really believe in all this. That's what makes me a believer, is I look at the New World
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:53.080]  Order, and they're believers, but they're believers on the other side. Absolutely, so the issue is
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:58.280]  not our Alex and Steve just making up stuff. Why don't people do their homework and recognize this?
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:03.080]  Hey, if they acknowledge that there's a devil, and even use the name of Jesus as an anthem,
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:07.960]  meaning it's forbidden to them, then the bottom line is that maybe someone should consider that
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:12.440]  there really is more to the spiritual play. By the way, Alex, eyewitness reports coming out of
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:19.000]  Nampa, Idaho. Nampa, Idaho, okay, confirm hearing foreign commanders ordering local law enforcement
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:24.440]  officers, EMTs, fire and airport officials in drills in the middle of the night. Now that's
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:29.640]  in Nampa, Idaho, foreign commanders ordering local law enforcement officers. Everybody better
[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:35.320]  realize that when who declared a level six alert, okay, pandemic, global pandemic alert,
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:40.280]  that that put us effectively under control of the United Nations, and guess who the security
[2:14:40.280 --> 2:14:45.800]  counselors, Russia, China, US, and all the other nations. So it should come as no surprise
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:51.320]  that something is up for it. I do not believe it can be pulled back. I believe it's gone hot,
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:55.400]  and I believe the days ahead are going to be the most perilous that this country has ever
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:15:01.080]  experienced in its entire life. You don't think the people going to all the town halls and saying no,
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:05.640]  and the poll numbers plunging will make the establishment back off? I think if people thought,
[2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:11.320]  I think if the establishment thought Obama was still going to be messianic, they were building
[2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:16.920]  him up for this, I just see them, they always try over and over again, and this is their biggest
[2:15:16.920 --> 2:15:22.280]  try so far. I just don't see it going well for them if they do engage. Well, and let me say this,
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:27.400]  I'm not telling anybody not to do those things. I'm also of the opinion that immediately,
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:33.000]  those of men, the men and women of means and who have the ability, we should be having recall
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:37.800]  petitions going out, but here's the deal. The question then becomes on the other side of it,
[2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:42.920]  does that even threaten them more to move up their time frame? I think, Alex, that the bottom
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:48.840]  line is the advantage of informing people is if we get that extra law enforcement officer,
[2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:54.840]  if we get that extra DEA agent, if we get the extra Border Patrol guy, if we save their family's
[2:15:54.840 --> 2:15:59.240]  lives, they finally come to grips with the fact that, hey, if we're ordered to any part of the
[2:15:59.240 --> 2:16:03.720]  United States to be away from our family, who's going to take care of them? And then they're
[2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:09.640]  being told, don't expect any resupply. I said, listen, ladies and gentlemen, you who take part
[2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:13.880]  in the deployment throughout the country in law enforcement to other states have just
[2:16:13.880 --> 2:16:18.360]  signed your death warrant and the death warrant. And by the way, in 1988, they tried to make a
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:23.480]  federal law where all cable systems and phones where the feds would dial in and give you messages.
[2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:30.760]  We just put up an Idaho news article, KPAK.com, Idaho officials working on statewide alert system
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:35.480]  where Homeland Security takes over the radio, the phone, everything. I told people this in
[2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:40.680]  police state 2000 in 1999, because I work in radio and FEMA came in and took over and put
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:45.000]  in their control box where everything goes through them. It is all really coming together
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:50.920]  right now, Steve. And I just, it's like we're going to have our own Mao Zedong here in America.
[2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:54.200]  And I just wish to guide this wasn't the case. And I hope we can stop it.
[2:16:54.200 --> 2:16:58.360]  Let's take some phone calls, common side effects, calling from Hawaii.
[2:16:59.080 --> 2:17:01.400]  Never had a caller with a name like that. Go ahead, caller.
[2:17:01.400 --> 2:17:05.960]  Hey, good morning, Alex. Good morning, Steve. Good morning.
[2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:15.800]  Yeah. Remind people to, to remind the listeners of May 13th, 1985, the city of Philadelphia
[2:17:15.800 --> 2:17:22.520]  dropped a bomb on the move from organization and burned down a whole city block. Now,
[2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:27.720]  a lot of people have been knowing that the government and the system is capable of these things.
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:35.080]  Some people have been targeted in the past. And, and, you know, it's, it's been,
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:40.440]  you know, people haven't come out and really supported these other humans like they really
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:46.360]  should have in this time of genocide. Now, as far as Alex, my personal opinion, I don't think
[2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:52.840]  you're racist. I'm a personal color. And I don't think it really matters if you're racist,
[2:17:52.840 --> 2:17:58.680]  not in all honesty. I mean, your information is crucial and certain information that you
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:03.800]  share with the audience, it doesn't have anything to do with racism.
[2:18:03.800 --> 2:18:08.120]  It has to do with, I mean, but a real, a racist wouldn't make a film like in game
[2:18:08.120 --> 2:18:13.720]  about how they're targeting black and Hispanic babies for abortion and infanticide and
[2:18:13.720 --> 2:18:19.240]  injecting black people with syphilis. It's the people that talk about race all day.
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:23.560]  They want to get everybody fighting with each other. So they can, I mean, Margaret Sanger
[2:18:23.560 --> 2:18:29.560]  and Rockefeller's brag how they come up and pose through the community groups to kill you.
[2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:34.440]  Right. And you have been coming out with the crucial information now,
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:41.560]  not to say that people of color could still be critical and, you know, because for instance,
[2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:48.680]  direct the King Alfred plan and the update of that, the Rex 84 plan, that needs to be read
[2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:54.040]  on the air to your million of listeners. This is an eight hour plan of how they're going to
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:19:01.000]  localize all the enforcement and then come in and divide up the families, put people in concentration
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:07.560]  camps. And then their end game is the mass burn trash incinerary. They get up to 5,000 degrees.
[2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:13.400]  That is what they're trying to, this is their final solution because in Nazi Germany,
[2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:20.920]  they were killing 10,000 people a day. And the ash from burning up folks caused a bottleneck.
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:26.840]  So it slowed down the production per se. And so, well, God bless you. Comment.
[2:19:26.840 --> 2:19:30.600]  Comment side effects. We got to go to break, but God bless you and your points.
[2:19:30.600 --> 2:19:33.640]  We're going to come back and take more calls. Quick comments, Steve Quill, when he was saying.
[2:19:33.640 --> 2:19:38.920]  Well, first of all, I agree with what he was saying about the end game and that is to basically
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:45.480]  kill the people and incinerate them and get them out of every form of eyesight possible.
[2:19:45.480 --> 2:19:50.680]  But I think that's more importantly, Alex, is that they have an end game. And remember,
[2:19:50.680 --> 2:19:57.720]  this is the globalist. This isn't just the willing dupes in the U.S. military, the U.S. law and justice.

[2:21:01.080 --> 2:21:06.680]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, August 12, 2009. Gold opened this morning at 9.4560.
[2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:14.280]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 9.7267, 486.34 for a half ounce or 243.17 for the quarter
[2:21:14.280 --> 2:21:21.640]  ounce. That's 972.67, 486.34 or 243.17. Failout equals market distortion's increased money supply
[2:21:21.640 --> 2:21:25.880]  while productivity is going down. Wall Street is receiving injections of liquidity while smaller
[2:21:25.880 --> 2:21:30.120]  companies are forced to concede. Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase
[2:21:30.120 --> 2:21:34.360]  market share paying fat dividends. Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins decreasing
[2:21:34.360 --> 2:21:38.600]  rapidly and leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left? Fiat currencies values
[2:21:38.600 --> 2:21:42.760]  based on trust, fiscal responsibility. Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly
[2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:47.000]  earning your trust or is it time to ensure your hard earned wealth? Midas Resources offers economic
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:52.440]  insurance, gold and silver coins, 800-686-2237. Do you believe that more bailout will solve our

[2:21:58.360 --> 2:22:06.680]  at 1800-686-2237. In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the
[2:22:06.680 --> 2:22:12.680]  spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as
[2:22:12.680 --> 2:22:19.480]  strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[2:22:19.480 --> 2:22:25.240]  for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, but since day one
[2:22:25.240 --> 2:22:30.440]  in this election, if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:37.720]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:22:37.720 --> 2:22:41.320]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:22:41.320 --> 2:22:49.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda. Get your copy

[2:23:03.800 --> 2:23:08.440]  People are being laid off in record numbers. The price of food continues to rise,
[2:23:08.440 --> 2:23:13.400]  and the economy continues to falter. You know that you need to prepare, and maybe you've been
[2:23:13.400 --> 2:23:20.040]  putting it off, but the time to act is now. That's why you need to visit OrganicaSea.com.

[2:24:04.200 --> 2:24:09.480]  I've got a report here. A man two hours before Obama was going to be in a town from New Hampshire
[2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:14.360]  was on the street with a gun and opened a view and they arrested him for not having a license.
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:21.080]  There's no license to own a gun in New Hampshire, Texas, Vermont. They give you a license to conceal
[2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:27.080]  because under the common law concealing a weapon is illegal. So they are definitely getting upset
[2:24:27.080 --> 2:24:31.240]  about that. I've got a guest coming on the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[2:24:33.080 --> 2:24:37.800]  Who was on hardball and the rest of it with the loaded handgun down the street from the event
[2:24:37.800 --> 2:24:43.720]  at a free state project event show that the people are going to openly demonstrate the
[2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:47.560]  second amendment so we don't lose it. That gentleman is joining us. I want to keep taking
[2:24:47.560 --> 2:24:52.120]  calls here for Steve Cuell. George, in Illinois, you're on the air with Steve Cuell. Go ahead.
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:59.080]  Hey, Jones, how you doing? Good. Hey, I wanted, I haven't seen you mention this on the website,
[2:24:59.080 --> 2:25:04.280]  but the Senate, the bill to audit the Fed and the Senate has 23 sponsors and even some big
[2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:12.520]  globalists like McCain and both of your senators are co-sponsoring it. Yeah, we constantly link
[2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:18.120]  to the 287 or whatever it is sponsors in the house, the 20 plus on the Senate,
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:23.480]  and the film I'm making. I mean, I got to admit when I'm spending eight, nine, 10 hours a day
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:28.120]  just on this film, it's hard to make one of these films. And we got like four guys in here,
[2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:34.040]  five guys total making it. And it's really me, Rob and Aaron doing the lion's share of actually
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:38.440]  the editing, the video, the research that I don't have a lot of time. I mean, I do miss a lot of
[2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:44.040]  things. So that's why we take our taking your calls, but very, very exciting. Yeah. And one more
[2:25:44.040 --> 2:25:50.120]  thing for Steve, he really needs to check out that book, the family by that Jeff Charlotte that
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:56.040]  you had on that is an amazing expose on the phony Christians. Absolutely. Thank you so much. I
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:26:01.800]  appreciate your call, George. Yeah, all of this is putting heat on the elite. And the fact that
[2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:07.160]  everybody is waking up to the new world order. I want to warn the feds that they bombed the
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:11.640]  Oklahoma city building in 95, the demonized the Liberty movement when Oklahoma passed the log
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:16.280]  against you and take over. That isn't going to work this time. People now know the new world
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:21.640]  order is real. Steve, well, I mean, how do you see this unfolding? Well, first of all, I think
[2:26:21.640 --> 2:26:27.400]  that they have to go hop because they know that the people are awakened, the audit, the fed. Listen,
[2:26:27.400 --> 2:26:32.120]  you've got control of the nation's money. You've got control control the nation. That's what lobbyists
[2:26:32.120 --> 2:26:37.080]  are. That's what payoffs are bribery. And when payoffs and bribery don't work, then use blackmail.
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:41.720]  So that's why I believe things are going to have to go really hot. Also, I think people are losing
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:47.880]  track of the fact that there are extraneous events to us that are taking place right now. I.E. is
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:53.400]  reeling around. Now, why is that important to us? It is my contention that the devils that are that
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:58.440]  know how to go for what's going on in this country will most likely try and link and sync
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:04.280]  with a major world event so they can cover up their nefarious deeds. In other words, a worldwide
[2:27:04.280 --> 2:27:09.240]  traumatic event. And you know what Tommy Frank said, the minute a nuclear weapon goes off the
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:14.840]  United States, the bottom line is that it's all over the Constitution. It's my, what would you say,
[2:27:14.840 --> 2:27:21.400]  learned and calculated thought process that we are going to see multiple events taking place
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:27.560]  and that they will use an international ban, whether it's London going up or a D.C. or New
[2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:33.160]  York going up, meaning going up by a nuclear weapon, that it's going to be the false spike
[2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:39.400]  scenario. It's going to be integrated. And listen, Alex, they don't ever intend to give up power.
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:44.920]  So anytime there's a threat to their power, they have to take the eyes of the awakened
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:49.080]  off of the events that led up to their awakening and substitute something else.
[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:54.600]  So what I'm saying is, is they will come up with a false spike or multiple false
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:59.480]  spikes tying it into an international event and then, you know, their killing spree begins in this
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:05.640]  country. See, I see them testing the flu to see if they can get people to take the shots
[2:28:06.200 --> 2:28:11.880]  and then beta testing each time for a bigger event. I see the incremental system where they
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:17.160]  contract, we push back, they release some of the contraction, then they contract again,
[2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:20.920]  we push back, they release some of the contraction. As soon as we give up again,
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:25.560]  think we've won, they contract again. That's the technique I see them using
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:31.240]  as they try to get control of us. But I mean, I just hope you're wrong, Steve. You've been
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:34.120]  right about a lot of things. I can tell you something. I hope I'm wrong, but you've got to
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:40.040]  say this. You said at the opening case, I called this one 12 to 13 years ago on how the flu
[2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:44.840]  would be utilized as a bio weapon. You actually did it longer ago than that. You did it in,
[2:28:44.840 --> 2:28:50.920]  well, yeah, 96. I guess that's about 13. Well, the deal is, is that all I'm trying to say is,
[2:28:50.920 --> 2:28:57.560]  is that, that look, I hope I'm wrong too, but we're seeing too many things taking place that
[2:28:57.560 --> 2:29:05.400]  suggests that look. I go back to that little formula, identification, billification, nullification,
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:11.080]  death. It was Chris Matthews who should be arrested by the FBI for stating on his show
[2:29:11.080 --> 2:29:15.160]  that everybody that doesn't buy the health bill, do you see the art in the quote? He's what they
[2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:20.360]  should be strapped down and injected with scopalamine. In essence, they should be legally
[2:29:20.360 --> 2:29:25.800]  injected. Now, excuse me, is that not a hateful thing to say? But see, Alex, it's double standards.
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:29.720]  What works for them is acceptable. What works against them must be put down at all costs.
[2:29:30.520 --> 2:29:35.720]  Well, yeah, like Obama says, put his poster up on stop signs. We're saying don't do that,
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:40.760]  put it up on legal places, and they're saying arrest me. So you can have the Obama thing as
[2:29:40.760 --> 2:29:46.600]  him as hope and change. You can't with me. Steve, stay there. More phone calls with Steve Quayle
[2:29:46.600 --> 2:29:58.200]  straight ahead. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:01.240 --> 2:30:05.800]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[2:30:05.800 --> 2:30:09.640]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:30:09.640 --> 2:30:15.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:19.960]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:24.680]  battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be
[2:30:24.680 --> 2:30:29.560]  any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[2:30:29.560 --> 2:30:34.200]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if
[2:30:34.200 --> 2:30:40.040]  you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much
[2:30:40.040 --> 2:30:45.640]  will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of

[2:31:05.640 --> 2:31:10.120]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[2:31:10.120 --> 2:31:15.320]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[2:32:04.520 --> 2:32:09.640]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[2:32:09.640 --> 2:32:14.600]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[2:32:14.600 --> 2:32:19.480]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[2:32:19.480 --> 2:32:24.360]  system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue atmospheric water
[2:32:24.360 --> 2:32:29.560]  generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Acola

[2:33:13.960 --> 2:33:18.200]  When Steve Quayle tells you a lot of elitist and a lot of patriots and people are leaving the
[2:33:18.200 --> 2:33:23.720]  country, it really is happening. And I hope we can back the globalist off. That's why the maximum
[2:33:23.720 --> 2:33:31.800]  effort is needed right now. We are going to continue with your phone calls. Dan, Alex, Randy,
[2:33:33.400 --> 2:33:40.920]  Manette, and others that are patiently holding, told for a number to join us. 1-800-259-9231.
[2:33:40.920 --> 2:33:46.680]  There have been some other big new developments. A man arrested outside of Obama's event,
[2:33:47.480 --> 2:33:52.840]  loaded guns hours before Obama even showed up, and actually just the nearby in the areas. Now
[2:33:52.840 --> 2:33:59.720]  they're just grabbing gun owners, searching cars. Does virus vaccine increase the risk of
[2:33:59.720 --> 2:34:05.720]  cancer? Major German News reports live cancer viruses in the vaccine. But for the next five,
[2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:09.720]  six minutes, I want to bring our sponsor up because even though the world is crazy,
[2:34:09.720 --> 2:34:15.960]  we'd all continue to go on living and preparing ourselves and trying to save money and also
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:21.080]  thanking all of our sponsors that make this radio show possible. And Marty Schachter,
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:24.920]  World War II vet in the chemical core, came back from World War II with his papa,
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:34.840]  and now with his son and their family, 60 plus years later, what's 47 to 2009? It's almost 70
[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:44.120]  years. It's incredible. It's absolutely amazing. Marty Schachter joins us and family on business
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:50.920]  out in Oakland, California, high quality, organic before organic was cool soap. And he only did
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:59.400]  factory direct to major hospitals and hotels and, and, and, and wealthy organizations and groups.
[2:34:59.400 --> 2:35:04.200]  Genesis got him as a sponsor because Michael Tardot, who's a sales manager here, was a fan
[2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:08.680]  of organic stuff and actually an environmentalist, but a conservative one. You know, somebody was
[2:35:08.680 --> 2:35:14.120]  still into organic stepping on a communist, basically, and got him as a sponsor. And I got
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:18.120]  sent some of the soap. My wife wanted more and loved it. And I washed my hair with it, the bar
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:23.800]  soap, the dishwashing soap, we use it. And normally you pay more for organic, you pay less
[2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:28.600]  for this than organic and less than the chemical stuff. See the chemical plants with all the oil
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:32.760]  they have all this byproducts. So they just put it into this, what you know, as detergents and soap.
[2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:37.320]  And it really hurts you. So this is really great stuff, but it's triple concentrated. Be sure
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:42.360]  and dilute it. I mean, a lot of people just take it pure and use it. You know, it's all triple
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:46.840]  concentrated. That's why it lasts so long. That's why it's 85% off supermarket prices. And you're
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:51.320]  not paying for all the additives and fillers. Marty, good to have you on with us. Good morning,
[2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:57.240]  Alex. Good to hear from you. Good to have you with us. Throw out to folks the tote bag, some of
[2:35:57.240 --> 2:36:03.240]  the products, how they get a free brochure, how they order a sampler tote bag, five star soap.com
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:08.120]  is the website, just the number five and star soap or spell it out, five star soap.com. Tell
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:13.240]  folks just in a nutshell about your fine product. Well, first I want to say we have a new improved
[2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:21.560]  website. It's a freshly redone and it makes it much more easy to look at same five star soap.com.
[2:36:21.560 --> 2:36:28.040]  But you really enjoy it. I hadn't looked at it the last week and they just popped it up on screen
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:34.360]  as we saw more cast on prisonplanet.tv. And it looked right before, but it really looks web 2.0
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:39.880]  and awesome. Now that's good news. Oh, yes. Well, we've worked on it. We want to do it for everybody
[2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:45.480]  and we thank for everybody looking at it and enjoying it. It's something to go forward with.
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:52.440]  Like I said, we make soap. We've been making soap for 62 years, still doing it successfully,
[2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:58.520]  enjoying all the radio, listening to calling us up and with questions. We've got all the answers,
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:06.920]  all the help. We make bar soap, laundry soap, dish soap and hair shampoo soap. Those are the
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:12.600]  four soaps. They'll do a hundred jobs. You eliminate the floor cleaner and the window cleaner
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:19.720]  and the woolen cleaner and the floor cleaner and all purpose cleaner. All these things you don't
[2:37:19.720 --> 2:37:25.880]  need ever again with the four basic soaps and our instructions. You can do all the cleaning.
[2:37:25.880 --> 2:37:31.400]  We've got bulk packages for large families or people that want to take care of their future.
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:39.080]  We go from a one to two year supply to a two, three to four year supply and our monster package
[2:37:39.080 --> 2:37:47.960]  of four to five year supply for a family of four at over 200 pounds of goods. Keep it on the shelf.
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:53.560]  Use it. It has an unlimited shelf life. You don't have to worry about that. But if you want to try
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:38:00.520]  the products and really enjoy the future, we have a sample of package. We call it a one month
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:07.400]  supply. It weighs out about six pounds. It'll last a family of four anywhere from four to eight weeks.
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:15.080]  It's got four bars of our pure soap, nothing like it anywhere, 18 ounces, a little jar of our
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:21.960]  triple concentrated laundry soap, not detergent soap, but a little tiny measuring scoop,
[2:38:22.680 --> 2:38:28.520]  16 ounces and a dispenser bottle of our triple concentrated cocoa butter shampoo,
[2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:36.040]  16 ounces and a dispenser bottle of our liquid dishcloth soap for washing pots, pads, utensils,
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:42.040]  all purpose cleaner, floor cleaner, window cleaner, hands, everything. All put together with a book of
[2:38:42.040 --> 2:38:48.920]  instructions, weighs out six pounds. It's $20. It'll get you started. It'll turn you around.
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:54.680]  It'll change your life. Well, exactly. I mean, everything with a globalist is a rip off and
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:59.720]  so you pay for a bunch of chemicals, a bunch of salt, a bunch of crud. Instead, you save money
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:03.800]  getting the high quality organic soap. It's a great thing to do. We'll put it back up on screen,
[2:39:03.800 --> 2:39:12.920]  five-star soap.com or Calbin pure soap.com. Either way, it'll get you there. And it's 800-340-7091,
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:24.200]  800-340-7091. Grab your pen and paper folks. You can also get a free brochure by calling 800-340-7091.
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:32.280]  Again, that's 800-340-7091. And Marty, it's always great having you pop in here on the show.
[2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:41.560]  Give us today's limerick. A wonderful bird is a freaking bird. His bill can hold more than his belly
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:48.600]  can. He can hold in his beak enough food for a week. And I wonder how in the hell he can.
[2:39:48.600 --> 2:40:02.680]  Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Marty, great having you. 800-340-7091 or five-star soap.com.
[2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:07.720]  Banners up on jonesreport.com and infowars.com. God bless you, Marty. Talk to you again soon.
[2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:11.320]  Thank you, Alex. Talk to you soon. Bye now. There he goes. What a character.
[2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:18.120]  62 years and counting running Cal Bend Pure Soap on a lighter note. I want to blitz through calls here
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:25.560]  with Dan, Alex, Randy, Manette, William, and a few others. But something, you know, I see this
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:32.280]  stuff everywhere, Steve. And I hope you're wrong, but I understand why you're seeing all this and
[2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:36.920]  now you're being followed and all this stuff's going on. It's happening to me. And they admit
[2:40:36.920 --> 2:40:41.880]  we have army documents that become mainstream news. How Ron Paul and myself are followed by the army.
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:48.200]  You say it's happening to you. I believe you. Then I see how they go. Oh, the winter Olympics
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:53.000]  are coming to Canada. There will be martial law in the city. You know, that's the headline I saw
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:57.800]  two days ago, one of their big papers, like it's good. And oh, there will be martial law in England
[2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:02.520]  for the Olympics. You know, they're just, they just say now, no rights, no free to speech. They
[2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:07.640]  say just like China, you'll be arrested if you even have a sign in your window of your house.
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:13.160]  And they're now announcing this for the G 20 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that's coming up.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:21.160]  We've got somebody inside National City Bank, National City, saying they're closing the branches
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:26.200]  there. I mean, this is just getting crazier and crazier, Steve. So there's no doubt they're trying
[2:41:26.200 --> 2:41:33.000]  to bring in tyranny. I guess we could just argue about the timeframe. Well, it's not only the
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:38.600]  timeframe, I'd say this, why is I think everybody should forget the timeframe in one sense, Alex,
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:42.760]  from the standpoint of look what's happening now. You've been accurate. I've been accurate. You've
[2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:46.680]  warned about the camps. I've warned about camps. Okay. They're now being built. You can go on
[2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:51.560]  Google and see them. You've warned about foreign troops. You it rules back in 2000. Now they're
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:57.800]  here in mass. They're not returning home after the national level exercise. That's the key. Okay.
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:02.120]  Before prior years, they did return home. You've warned in your end game video.
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:05.720]  No, the Pentagon, I got interrupted. The Pentagon admits they have all these new drills,
[2:42:05.720 --> 2:42:09.640]  and they're just keeping it going. Go ahead. Yeah. And you've warned, you know, in end game
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:14.360]  video that the Illuminati plant, the Illuminati's plan is for a mass blood sacrifice. Listen,
[2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:20.680]  nothing would delight the devil more than 25 to 50 million people butchered in this country.
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:25.800]  You know, and again, look at their plan. They're out in the media. They control the media.
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:32.200]  There is no such thing as truth and fairness. Come on. In the mainstream media, even Glenn
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:36.360]  Beck and so many of the people that people say, well, they're telling the truth. It's not what
[2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:41.720]  they say. It's what they're not allowed to say. And we're actually in a medically declared state
[2:42:41.720 --> 2:42:47.000]  of emergency under level six, the World Health Organization. The only logical conclusion, Alex,
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:51.960]  is now they're going to do what you and I have warned about and it's hard. Listen, I understand
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:57.560]  it's as hard for you and me having warned about it all these years to grasp the fact that it's no
[2:42:57.560 --> 2:43:02.680]  longer future. It's here. That's why people need to get their food now. They need to get whatever
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:07.240]  they're going to get. And I tell everybody, and I told some people that came in my story yesterday,
[2:43:07.240 --> 2:43:11.720]  if today is the last day that you could go to the store to prepare, how long could you last?
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:15.640]  One person said two weeks. One person said two months. I said, and then they said,
[2:43:15.640 --> 2:43:20.520]  but what do we do after that? I said, after that, the plans are for you to die. And again,
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:25.800]  see, this is not warm and fuzzy. This is not cuddly and cute. This is reality. And you quote
[2:43:25.800 --> 2:43:33.560]  Stalin, the purges of Stalin, Mao, all of the great destruction that has taken place in the
[2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:38.600]  history of the world. And people thought coming and those who could spoke up, but those who were
[2:43:38.600 --> 2:43:43.480]  silent, those are the ones that if they weren't killed immediately had to live with the rest of
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:47.560]  their lives of knowing when they could have done something, they could have said something,
[2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:51.640]  they could have stood for anything. They stood for nothing and watched the needless.
[2:43:51.640 --> 2:43:56.440]  And it didn't, and it didn't happen here because we've had guns and we're willing to defend ourselves.
[2:43:56.440 --> 2:44:00.840]  Absolutely. And that's why they're going for the guns. Look, they wouldn't be GPSing.
[2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:06.120]  When someone, when I meet someone from North com and they tell me that we were telling them
[2:44:06.120 --> 2:44:11.080]  they were GPSing for the census and the mark homes for law enforcement before they even admitted
[2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:16.200]  it, now they admit it. Go ahead. Right. And when I have someone who, who with tears in his eyes,
[2:44:16.200 --> 2:44:20.920]  who works for the U.S. military in a command level, basically saying, Steve, they're going to use
[2:44:20.920 --> 2:44:26.440]  the air assets of the entire U.S. Air Force against the citizen. That, and I'm telling you this,
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:30.440]  Alex, you don't just sit there and go, oh, that's nice. Gee, I hope they don't. No, no, no,
[2:44:30.440 --> 2:44:36.200]  daily cost said, Bragg, we're in control now. We'll use the Air Force against the American
[2:44:36.200 --> 2:44:40.680]  people. We'll get their guns. Right. But I said that, I said that before that even came out of
[2:44:40.680 --> 2:44:45.640]  the daily cause. Okay. See, it's not enough. I don't make this stuff up. Number one, I don't
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:50.840]  even know, you know, seriously, if I saw ranks, if I saw enough stars, I'd know it's a general.
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:55.880]  But what I'm telling you is when I know people that come in and basically can answer questions
[2:44:55.880 --> 2:45:00.280]  that no one can answer, except them. And when they've got tears rolling down their eyes and say,
[2:45:00.280 --> 2:45:05.560]  the reason I'm telling you this is because I know that you're trying to save lives. And when
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:10.360]  I'm being told that they're leaving the military, and I said, do you mean like leaving like,
[2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:14.520]  you know, going AWOL, they said, I'll do whatever I have to to get back to my family.
[2:45:14.520 --> 2:45:20.600]  But I'm not going to take part in the selective quote, his words carpet bombing of Americans
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:27.640]  in American cities. So when I hear of F 16 circling over specific areas, no, no, we've had, we've had
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:35.720]  Blackhawks, Cobras, C Cobras, Chinooks, B two bombers flying over Austin in the last two weeks
[2:45:35.720 --> 2:45:43.720]  during NLA O nine. Absolutely. Now they're a 10s and everything. Look, I was told by, uh, by,
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:48.280]  uh, let's just say that someone who hates my gut, he said, we won't even waste the bullet on you.
[2:45:48.280 --> 2:45:53.000]  You get a hellfire missile. I said, well, you may get your hellfire missile off, pal, but you end
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:58.040]  up in hell. And I meant that not as a sarcastic, you know, gee, what's a good comeback. So the
[2:45:58.040 --> 2:46:03.800]  thing that I'm trying to tell you is, is that what do they do with the Taliban? Crap. They'll
[2:46:03.800 --> 2:46:09.480]  send a UAV with hellfires against them. So why is it any different? Why is it any different, Alex?
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:14.760]  It isn't. It's just that we cannot believe as Americans who have enjoyed the freedom of our
[2:46:14.760 --> 2:46:21.080]  God given rights. Ooh, maybe we shouldn't forget him that we had something. And because of apathy
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:24.040]  indifference, not talking about you, I'm not talking about me and the others who have carried
[2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:29.640]  this fight on for so long. But because of apathy indifference and entertainment, the greatest
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:35.400]  mind melt, and I could use another word, but I won't, medium that's ever been invented. We have
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:40.280]  been low to sleep. We are in a state of abandonment. Well, bottom line, we got to wake up or it's
[2:46:40.280 --> 2:46:44.600]  going to get worse. Let's talk to Dan in Texas. Dan, you're on the air with Steve Quill, Stevequill.com.
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:51.640]  Go ahead. Steve's right. Ebola was created in a lab. I think Gardasil's Ebola, it has all the
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:46:56.520]  symptoms, a rash, red eyes, hiccups, internal, external bleeding, a rash developed on dark
[2:46:56.520 --> 2:47:01.800]  skin. It's unrecognized in pregnant women. It leads to heavy vaginal bleeding and that's all
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:06.920]  common Ebola symptoms. The first person to ever get Ebola was in, uh, Zaire, Mabella,
[2:47:06.920 --> 2:47:13.720]  Loke, Kella in 1976. Yeah. Right outside a bio weapons lab. Yeah. Yeah. He got injected
[2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:18.440]  with, uh, what was supposed to be Quinnean and then most of the women in his family died soon.
[2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:23.000]  Notice they have new outbreaks in the U S and Iraq of troops after they get vaccinated,
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:28.760]  just like the 76 vaccine. Go ahead. So my suggestion is that Steve's right. They've
[2:47:28.760 --> 2:47:33.080]  already tested it with Gardasil. They know people will line up and just take this stuff.
[2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:38.040]  So it's going to be easy for them to scare it. They'll just repackage it into the H1N1. The lab
[2:47:38.040 --> 2:47:42.440]  that can actually see the viruses have very expensive microscopes and they're all under
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:46.760]  heavy control by the military or the pharmaceutical industry. Well, those that aren't are coming out,
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:52.360]  mainstream news freaking out going, this is some kind of bio weapon. I mean, I've got major German
[2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:57.400]  news saying it's got cancer viruses in it and asking, why is this in here? And they're just going,
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:06.120]  we're the eugenicists. Shut up. We love you. We, I mean, it's just so sick. The stuff they
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:11.480]  write and talk about. Well, again, they're going to, they're going to try and do that. And I'm
[2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:17.480]  saying that there's going to be, uh, in fighting and double crossing and triple crossing betrayal,
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:25.240]  uh, counter force war, war within the intelligence community, specific agencies against each other.
[2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:28.520]  By the way, they're killing each other upright and left, right down. For those of you that doubt
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:32.680]  that, just remember Roland Carnaby and the intelligence. Well, why do you think it's coming
[2:48:32.680 --> 2:48:37.080]  out on Blackwater now? We knew about the slave rings with little kids and the sex parties and
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:42.360]  the wife swapping and how, you know, the, how the mercs were shipping in weapons systems to sell
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:47.880]  to the resistance to even have a fake war. Now it's in federal filings. This isn't just coming
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:54.840]  out for no reason. There is war going on within the new oral order. Absolutely. And the head of
[2:48:54.840 --> 2:49:01.720]  Blackwater, which is now called VXE, he stepped down and he, uh, obviously they're coming after him
[2:49:01.720 --> 2:49:07.320]  for, uh, being involved in murder. But the thing is, is that obviously when, when the Illuminati
[2:49:07.320 --> 2:49:13.480]  or elite turn on their own, it's usually based on a change of heart. And I hope that's what has
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:17.400]  happened to the head. Well, that's what happened when Lennon went to Stalin. They had a big blood
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:23.400]  feast when Hitler got rid of the essay essay, right when he really got power on February 27th,
[2:49:23.400 --> 2:49:30.440]  1933, every Reichstag, seven months into office. Whenever they run these ops or a few months into
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:35.480]  office, excuse me, whenever they run these ops, well, you're saying it shows a change of heart.
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:39.800]  I've seen that a lot of times be a jump point when they're really getting ready to really
[2:49:39.800 --> 2:49:43.640]  start slaughtering. They first kill their own people. Wait, you're saying it can be good news?
[2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:47.960]  That could be a two, because look, if they're hanging them out to dry and they're throwing
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:53.480]  them to the wolves, uh, it's either for something he knows, something he's done or something he won't
[2:49:53.480 --> 2:49:59.720]  do. Think about that. Something he knows, something he's done or something he won't do. And, and I
[2:49:59.720 --> 2:50:04.600]  don't know the man, so I can't go beyond, you know, just the stories of red, but I will tell you this.
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:14.440]  That's a huge red flag right there. Amazing. Okay. Thank you, Dan. Alex and Marilyn will start
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:19.400]  your call and hold you over. Go ahead, Alex. Hello. Hey, Alex. How you doing? How you doing, Steve?
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:24.440]  Good. Good. Hey, I just wanted to say, Alex, keep doing what you're doing, man. You woke me up this
[2:50:24.440 --> 2:50:28.520]  year, man. I always do something with fishing going on, but you woke me up this year. Uh,
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:33.160]  just got a quick question and a comment as well. Uh, one, uh, wanted to let you go. I live real
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:37.800]  close. I live about six miles away from the, uh, the Capitol right here in Maryland. And, uh, about
[2:50:37.800 --> 2:50:42.760]  every two weeks or so, uh, you've got, uh, officers patrolling the area in my neighborhoods, uh,
[2:50:42.760 --> 2:50:49.480]  housing neighborhood, uh, around 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock roaming around. And, uh, I wanted to
[2:50:49.480 --> 2:50:55.240]  say also, uh, do you think in case we do go to war, if things really hit the fan, that the
[2:50:55.240 --> 2:51:00.760]  military start using, uh, uh, people who are improving just like they did in Vietnam? Stay there.
[2:51:00.760 --> 2:51:05.000]  Stay there. When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind? If it's

[2:52:12.440 --> 2:52:18.840]  Could their objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:52:19.480 --> 2:52:25.480]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:52:25.480 --> 2:52:33.720]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:39.080]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.

[2:53:00.680 --> 2:53:04.920]  For years, doctors and researchers had known that one of the major pathways to better health is an
[2:53:04.920 --> 2:53:10.760]  alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance. For 15 years,
[2:53:10.760 --> 2:53:15.080]  people have trusted Alcazone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance,
[2:53:15.080 --> 2:53:19.640]  getting rid of acidic waste buildup and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.

[2:54:22.040 --> 2:54:26.040]  In the next segment, before Daryl Rundis joins us, just when we got the gentleman on,
[2:54:26.040 --> 2:54:29.560]  he had the gun a few blocks away from where Obama was at in the media,
[2:54:29.560 --> 2:54:31.880]  made a big deal out of that. He's joining us at the end of the show today.
[2:54:32.920 --> 2:54:42.120]  WESHTV is reporting that people were saying it was a hate crime, a Nazi crime, to put up Obama
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:48.600]  posters in public places that said New World Order. Back there, the police are saying it is not
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:54.280]  considered a hate crime. But see, they say under federal rules now they're trying to pass in the
[2:54:54.280 --> 2:55:01.000]  house that hurting feelings is a hate crime. This is nuts. And we've said from day one,
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:08.600]  post these in public commons where other posters are posted. Do not post it on post offices or
[2:55:08.600 --> 2:55:14.680]  government things. I mean, there's a poll out front of government building. Yeah, that's good.
[2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:18.840]  People put stuff on those all the time. They're telling us everywhere we can't go out in speech
[2:55:18.840 --> 2:55:24.200]  and have demonstrations. We have to stand up for our free speech, but now I'm some evil hate
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:30.440]  criminal. That's coming up. Yes, to answer the caller's question, they are hiring criminals for
[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:36.280]  the military. They are hiring felons. They are hiring illegal aliens, and even police agencies
[2:55:36.280 --> 2:55:41.000]  are now. And that's mainstream news. You can just search engine, startpage.com is a good search
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:45.960]  engine. You can just search that out and see that for yourself. Steve Quayle comments on that front.
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:55:53.240]  Well, I think it's obvious that we're going to see the enlisting of all sorts of quote-unquote
[2:55:53.240 --> 2:55:59.160]  what society would call undesirables, not my term, theirs to enlist in this war against us. Listen,
[2:55:59.160 --> 2:56:04.040]  Alex, when the Chinese were bringing in weapons almost 10 years ago to the different gangs,
[2:56:04.040 --> 2:56:10.040]  the different groups and the entire West Coast, we were reporting on that. There were stories
[2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:15.000]  in the, excuse me, mainstream press about it, and people said, well, I hope that doesn't mean
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:19.560]  what I think it means. It means exactly what it is. Listen, I've interviewed gang members,
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:23.880]  I've interviewed revolutionaries over the years, being on talk radio, and they all say,
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:28.200]  we know it's coming, and they don't plan on giving up their guns. So the point is,
[2:56:28.200 --> 2:56:34.120]  is that it's going to be total chaos, and this is absolutely a necessity under the
[2:56:34.120 --> 2:56:39.080]  communist manifesto, but more so under the New World Order's doctrine, outgoals the old,
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:45.880]  incomes anew, Brent Scowcroft's famous statement, by consent or by conquest, there will be a New
[2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:50.600]  World Order. Obviously, the consent is not there, therefore, the conquest is underway.
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:58.440]  Absolutely. I just can't believe that the public thinks it's illegal to put a poster up on a white
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:57:03.000]  poll where everybody else puts posters up. I mean, they don't freak out when it's a lost dog
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:10.440]  or a pro Obama poster. Look, I have the president saying, put these on, put his on stop signs.
[2:57:11.400 --> 2:57:17.720]  Now, I told people, don't put them on stop signs. But see, it's okay for Obama on his letterhead,
[2:57:17.720 --> 2:57:24.600]  show people, this is, this made national news, it's okay. He says, put it on, put it on state
[2:57:24.600 --> 2:57:28.600]  and property. I'm saying don't do that, but he's okay. But then you put it on,
[2:57:28.600 --> 2:57:35.480]  you know, some type of thing downtown where other posters are, you're supposedly evil. These people
[2:57:35.480 --> 2:57:39.800]  are sick. But just like you said, Steve, it's two different rules. They have two different systems.
[2:57:40.840 --> 2:57:46.920]  It's them versus us. And that's what's obvious. And now let me tell you something. More protests
[2:57:46.920 --> 2:57:51.080]  are going to feel more threatened. More threats going to feel more laws are going to feel more
[2:57:51.080 --> 2:57:56.280]  laws. Again, America being able to express its concern. Well, that's why I did this a week
[2:57:56.280 --> 2:58:00.600]  and a half ago, I saw them demonizing whoever put a few of these up in LA and the media was saying,
[2:58:00.600 --> 2:58:06.840]  should they be allowed? Is it okay? Is it racist? And I went, they made Bush the Joker and I supported
[2:58:06.840 --> 2:58:11.720]  that. We even posted it on our website. I said, so I said, everybody, I'm going to make t-shirts,
[2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:16.040]  which we now have available for sale. Next, they'll say you can't wear this. And we got them in
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:21.160]  black and white and different messages on them at infowars.com. Steve Quayle, do one more minute
[2:58:21.160 --> 2:58:24.120]  with us on the other side. I want to plug your website, your books, your materials,
[2:58:24.120 --> 2:58:27.160]  all very informative. I know you're so concerned about what's happening. You're not even
[2:58:27.160 --> 2:58:31.000]  plugging them these days, but people still need to get them and read them.
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:36.440]  SteveQuayle.com, my websites, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv,

[3:00:18.440 --> 3:00:35.640]  All right, we are into the fourth and final hour today. Steve Cuell joined us to break down the
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:41.160]  whole flu situation. I see that as the only card they've got to really be able to say the general
[3:00:41.160 --> 3:00:46.040]  public's the enemy, their pretext of fear and hysteria. That's the best card they've got. They
[3:00:46.040 --> 3:00:51.240]  got some other cards they can play. Stage terror saying conservatives did it, saying Antonine
[3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:56.120]  new water people did it. We now see the Southern Prairie Law Center and others coming out prehyping
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:01:02.280]  that. So that really increases the danger of that. But does virus increase the risk of cancer?
[3:01:02.280 --> 3:01:07.880]  Live cancer viruses will go over more of this. Darrell run is coming up a ton of other news as
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:13.160]  things accelerate and just get crazier and crazier. I want to commend all the video entries of folks
[3:01:13.160 --> 3:01:18.280]  out at public places where other posters are being posted. Other handbills are being posted.
[3:01:18.280 --> 3:01:22.600]  Make sure you follow the rules to do that. But I can only say great job to everybody.
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:27.480]  This is a great exercise in the first amendment. Steve and closing. Why do you think this Joker
[3:01:27.480 --> 3:01:34.280]  image scares them so much? A, B, tell us about some of the great books and things you've written.
[3:01:36.280 --> 3:01:42.120]  To order the books that I have written because especially my weather wars and unnatural disasters
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:46.440]  because war is going to be, I'm sorry, weather wars and weather modification is going to be used
[3:01:46.440 --> 3:01:55.080]  as a force multiplier. They can call my store 406-586-4840. My book that's really critical
[3:01:55.080 --> 3:02:00.200]  for the end times is Breathe No Evil was written almost a decade ago. My genetic
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:05.960]  armageddon book talks about what's going on and it actually took into account all of the
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:11.320]  biological brew that would be unleashed upon us. My book, obviously Genesis 6,
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:16.440]  Giants, which is a classic and I think Alex, the thing that people need to understand is that this
[3:02:16.440 --> 3:02:22.280]  is that we are running out of time. In my perspective, they had better recognize that
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:27.160]  there comes a day when the powers that be shut the internet off, shut down the communication,
[3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:31.880]  shut down the power, shut down everything and then they're only going to be left to what they know
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:36.760]  and what they've been trained IP for or the knowledge that UI and others have given them.
[3:02:36.760 --> 3:02:43.160]  Those people needing survival skills, you need to go to survivalblog.com, the best website of
[3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:48.760]  its kind in the world. Those who need preparedness manual to get caught up to speed, Holly Dale,
[3:02:48.760 --> 3:02:53.400]  Dare to Prepare. By the way, she's sending you a couple of those, Alex. The biggest,
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:58.840]  best book for preparation that's ever been done, Dare to Prepare by Stan and Holly Dale,
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:03.960]  D-D-Y-O. So I just want to thank you for the time and Alex, and I say this not as anything
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:09.960]  other than thank you. I do pray for you, your family safety, but as far as I know, and I have
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:16.440]  this sense, our days of speaking are very limited. It's not because of what we would or not do,
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:21.240]  it's what they intend to do and shut us down. And the full court presses on and people have
[3:03:21.240 --> 3:03:26.040]  better get close to the living God, they better repent, they better understand that the one who
[3:03:26.040 --> 3:03:31.400]  laid all these events out for us in the beginning was Jesus. They said it's going to happen and
[3:03:31.400 --> 3:03:38.200]  it's going to happen. The question is, can we stop it? Every day we have another day of giving
[3:03:38.200 --> 3:03:43.800]  more information out, preparing another individual, another group, or another country around the world.
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:49.720]  We go worldwide, as you know. That's what I thank God for. Moments of mercy, because very soon
[3:03:49.720 --> 3:03:54.520]  the moments of mercy will give way to the moments of madness. Well, I hope that's not the case.
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:58.440]  We're going to stop that. But why do you think this Joker poster in the last minute
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:04.920]  has concerned the elitists so much? Because the Joker poster is emblematic of evil in the last
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:10.200]  uh, the Heath Ledger portrayal the Joker in the last Batman was Harold was probably one of the most
[3:04:10.200 --> 3:04:17.560]  brilliant portrayals by an actor of sinister evil coupled with sort of a funny face.
[3:04:17.560 --> 3:04:23.560]  That's what's getting to the elite. The elite know they've used every form of symbol. They've used
[3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:31.320]  every form of uh, subconscious portrayal and all their media uh, what I call vomit presentations.
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:36.680]  And now it's because it's being turned back on them, Alex. Yeah, it's taking when they get a taste
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:41.880]  of their own medicine. It's taking their archetype into filing their God, their front man, Morocco,
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:46.200]  Obama. And that's why we're selling the t-shirt available at infowars.com. Don't let them chill
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:51.480]  your free speech, wear it proudly in public, or we lose the First Amendment. Steve Quayle,
[3:04:51.480 --> 3:04:57.160]  thanks for all the info. Thanks Alex, bye-bye. God bless. SteveQuayle.com, our site's infowars.com,
[3:04:57.160 --> 3:05:03.320]  prisonplanet.tv, they'll run straight ahead. Stay with us. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[3:05:03.320 --> 3:05:08.280]  you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation
[3:05:08.280 --> 3:05:13.240]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[3:05:13.240 --> 3:05:18.360]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of
[3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:23.240]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the
[3:05:23.240 --> 3:05:27.480]  country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months
[3:05:27.480 --> 3:05:32.040]  ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year,
[3:05:32.040 --> 3:05:36.840]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power

[3:06:01.400 --> 3:06:06.040]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[3:06:06.040 --> 3:06:11.000]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:16.760]  I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[3:06:16.760 --> 3:06:22.040]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it?
[3:06:22.040 --> 3:06:26.680]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[3:06:26.680 --> 3:06:31.320]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:06:31.320 --> 3:06:36.680]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[3:06:36.680 --> 3:06:41.880]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:06:41.880 --> 3:06:46.600]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to
[3:06:46.600 --> 3:06:55.560]  live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.

[3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:22.040]  continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. We have found it! We have found it!
[3:08:22.040 --> 3:08:28.680]  And it's going up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com by the end of the show. The Washington Post
[3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:34.360]  with Obama telling his people to take the images of him with hope and change and put it on stop
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:39.960]  signs and government buildings. Now, we're not saying that. We're saying put it where it's legal
[3:08:39.960 --> 3:08:45.400]  and lawful in your area. You know, where people put posters up, which is all over downtown. You
[3:08:45.400 --> 3:08:50.600]  see posters, put it up there so they can't say you've done something wrong. They're on the news
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:57.720]  saying you can't put it on a power pole and that we're criminals, hate criminals, that it's racial,
[3:08:58.520 --> 3:09:02.680]  but the Kato Institute's defending us. Sorry, not every criticism of Obama is racist.
[3:09:03.720 --> 3:09:10.040]  And they go over it. But man, they are really coming after us and they are scared of this. So
[3:09:10.040 --> 3:09:15.160]  put more of the posters up, but don't put them up on private property. Put them up where you,
[3:09:15.160 --> 3:09:19.800]  you know, like in downtown areas or bulletin boards or like, you know, you always see the
[3:09:19.800 --> 3:09:23.640]  abandoned buildings that have just all over them. People are doing that there, but I guess they may
[3:09:23.640 --> 3:09:29.800]  selectively enforce. There could be ads for furniture and ads for lost dogs and ads for the
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:35.240]  local hamburger place. I guess we just give in and say, okay, we're going to let you selectively
[3:09:35.240 --> 3:09:40.920]  tell us we can't put the posters up, but Obama can be in the Washington Post and tell everybody
[3:09:40.920 --> 3:09:47.400]  to put his up. Now YouTube censoring us. YouTube took down two of my videos, not me joking around
[3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:52.360]  like the Joker to promote this contest. That's why I did that. But serious ones where I said,
[3:09:52.360 --> 3:09:57.240]  it isn't about Obama. It isn't about Bush, their puppets. Let's come together against the New World
[3:09:57.240 --> 3:10:04.120]  Order. Obama's really a fascist, but he's just a front. The posters aren't racist. They're removing
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:09.160]  those because they don't want us to come together. And I remember a few months ago talking to Darrell
[3:10:09.160 --> 3:10:15.160]  Rundus, who's done a lot of big, successful things in the past. I said, uh, well, he said,
[3:10:15.160 --> 3:10:19.720]  I'm going to start something for the people's own YouTube. And, uh, you know, there's a lot of other
[3:10:19.720 --> 3:10:25.560]  video sites out there, but this is going to be one where you do news.com couldn't beat the URL.
[3:10:25.560 --> 3:10:32.440]  He said it was just available. Wow. That's, that's Providence. Just you, the letter you do news.com.
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:36.680]  And there it is. It says coming soon, Darrell. I would, I would imagine we need to have you up
[3:10:36.680 --> 3:10:42.120]  for a main interview when it's ready to go. Well, we should be ready to release it. Or should I
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:48.920]  say, unleash this on the public Monday. Um, so hopefully we can get down to Austin. Forgive
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:53.000]  me for not getting in the, in the studio today. Well, that's fine. But we want to have you when
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:57.560]  you officially launch it. So the next few weeks, once it's up and going, we'll get it up. But tell
[3:10:57.560 --> 3:11:03.400]  us about you do news. Well, first off, what do you think about Obama's in the Washington Post saying,
[3:11:03.400 --> 3:11:08.200]  put my image up on stop signs? That's a quote I have as official White House letter. But then
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:14.360]  my listeners aren't allowed to put them on power polls. Well, that among many, many other
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:20.920]  selective, uh, prosecution or selective, um, constitutional enforcement, you know, it's good
[3:11:20.920 --> 3:11:25.480]  for them, but it's not good for us. In fact, the one question I'd be asking all these politicians
[3:11:25.480 --> 3:11:31.640]  at these, uh, town halls is, if this healthcare is so good, why aren't you doing it? You know,
[3:11:31.640 --> 3:11:35.160]  what, you know, if it's good for you, then I'll do it too. So I'll do it. If you do it,
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:39.080]  everybody believes in the, in the golden rule, right? Do one to others that you have them do to
[3:11:39.080 --> 3:11:42.840]  you. Even people that don't believe in God believe in the golden rule. So if it's good for us,
[3:11:42.840 --> 3:11:48.280]  should be good for them. Let them go first. What do you think? Well, I agree with you. I don't want
[3:11:48.280 --> 3:11:52.440]  to get into some more of those issues, but uh, Darrell, tell us about what you do news.com is
[3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:56.840]  going to look like. Um, what's going to be happening. What it's going to look like. Let me tell you
[3:11:56.840 --> 3:12:02.280]  what it's going to be. See, I don't want it to be some new cool website. Sure. It's going to be
[3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:07.160]  like YouTube. You can upload videos. You can also upload audio. So you could record conversations
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:11.800]  with your politicians or your tax collector when they're railroad and you can post them
[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:17.000]  into your own blog on our website, import the audio and do a story that wraps around that audio.
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:21.960]  So we're going to have a lot of different media available to people to, you know, for the news
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:26.840]  they do. But let me tell you what's really my hope and my prayer for this thing. Okay. Because I'm
[3:12:26.840 --> 3:12:32.280]  not in this for the money. You know that. What makes this different than YouTube? It's the fact
[3:12:32.280 --> 3:12:37.160]  that we're going to pay you for the news you do. So you can continue to just let your news get
[3:12:37.160 --> 3:12:42.680]  tossed down the tube or you can go to you do news, post your information, post your story,
[3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:50.040]  and we're going to pay you for the news you do. Well, that's a great idea. And we do need more
[3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:53.160]  alternatives. I think it's a great name. It's going to have a lot of different functions and
[3:12:53.160 --> 3:12:58.920]  I got some great IT people. So we should see this launch next Monday. I can go to you do news.com
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:03.720]  and start uploading videos. Absolutely. In fact, let me just give you an example. I looked,
[3:13:03.720 --> 3:13:10.120]  I Googled your name on YouTube. Okay. You got a video here that you, I guess, produced 2.7 million
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:17.240]  views. Let me ask you a question. How much money did YouTube pay you? They paid me zero. They
[3:13:17.240 --> 3:13:22.120]  selectively will do it with some people. We ask and they said, no, we don't want to be an affiliate
[3:13:22.120 --> 3:13:27.720]  with you. And I've been told that I got videos with over 3 million, 4 million, 5 million views
[3:13:27.720 --> 3:13:32.360]  actually on there that a regular person who they do do a deal with would probably be paid about
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:38.040]  $50,000 for that. That's right. So we're, you know, we want this to be more than one. No, no,
[3:13:38.040 --> 3:13:43.480]  YouTube makes money off me and but then still erases what they don't like. Well, I mean,
[3:13:43.480 --> 3:13:47.640]  they're doing me a favor, but, but, but they actually want us there. No, they're making money
[3:13:47.640 --> 3:13:53.320]  off the masses. So you listen close America. Okay. Look, I've already made my money. I'm doing this
[3:13:53.320 --> 3:13:59.560]  to create a community, an internet community that's certainly of, by and for the people. Okay. This
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:04.840]  is your website. This is going to be a community of independent news journalists who get up,
[3:14:04.840 --> 3:14:09.080]  get out, they grab their camera, they grab their cell phone, their recorders, and they start doing
[3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:15.800]  news because as Judge Napolitano said at the Tea Party in Ohio, there is nothing,
[3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:20.840]  nothing the government hates more than for us to expose the deeds they do in darkness
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:28.120]  with light, the light of the camera. He said the camera is the new gun and I agree with him. I think
[3:14:28.120 --> 3:14:32.280]  that's what my passion now is why I'm doing this whole thing. And once again, it's not about me.
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:37.160]  This is all about the news you do. So here's how it's going to work. Let me just sell it out for
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:42.680]  America so they really get this, Alex. We, every single quarter, when we get out of beta testing,
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:48.040]  which should be about January, every quarter, we're going to pay out 20% of our ad revenue.
[3:14:48.040 --> 3:14:53.640]  And we're going to distribute that ad revenue, that 20% to everybody. I don't care how long you've
[3:14:53.640 --> 3:14:58.680]  been a reporter with Udo News, I don't care what content you produce. As long as it's your content,
[3:14:58.680 --> 3:15:03.160]  it's the original content, you produce that news. You can take news clips from Fox,
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:07.560]  do commentary on it, news reviews, what we call that. Whatever it is, it's got to be creative,
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:12.360]  it's got to be original, it's got to be factual, it's got to be good, hard hitting news.
[3:15:12.360 --> 3:15:17.640]  But at the end of that quarter, if you've got, let's say, Alex, 10% of the total views on our
[3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:26.680]  website, you get 10% of that ad revenue. That's exciting. And it'll take a lot of bandwidth.
[3:15:26.680 --> 3:15:29.880]  We thought about doing this like ourselves. I just don't have the funds
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:35.640]  or the energy to try to raise the money to do something like that. So I'm glad you've got it,
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:40.520]  Darryl, because for those that don't know, for us, when we have a video that gets like 30,
[3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:45.800]  40,000 views, we've had Google erase our flu emergency report, we posted it, and I forget,
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:49.880]  it was like 40, 50,000 views in a couple of days. And that was a couple thousand dollars
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:15:56.920]  for me to have to pay. And we've got pretty good pricing on bulk, you know, bulk bandwidth,
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:02.360]  we're using, what is it, 100 terabytes a month now or something in between everything or more?
[3:16:03.560 --> 3:16:07.640]  Yeah, 75 terabytes, we've got 100. So if we go up to 100, then that was
[3:16:07.640 --> 3:16:12.360]  the original. Well, but like I have counted the cost and I'm willing to roll at minimum
[3:16:12.360 --> 3:16:17.160]  a million of my own dollars into this, okay, before I ever even think about breaking even
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:23.000]  in order to create the platform for the people to share the news that everyone in the world needs
[3:16:23.000 --> 3:16:26.280]  to know. Well, that's good, Darryl. I should talk to you behind the scenes. I want to make
[3:16:26.280 --> 3:16:30.920]  sure you're getting the best price on bandwidth. I mean, are you using big CDNs? Yeah, we're gonna,
[3:16:30.920 --> 3:16:34.600]  that's the only delay. We'd be rolling hot right now. We'd be going live right now,
[3:16:34.600 --> 3:16:39.640]  but I want to make sure all the CDNs are in place so that if they hack us, or we get an
[3:16:39.640 --> 3:16:44.600]  abundance of views all at one time, that there's what's called load balancing among those CDNs
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:16:51.400]  as well. So that way it's fast and good or bigger and better than YouTube. And once again,
[3:16:51.400 --> 3:16:56.200]  look, you can keep uploading all your videos to YouTube and let the big corporate Googles
[3:16:56.200 --> 3:16:59.960]  of the world make them. No, no, no, exactly. You go on YouTube and you promote things like
[3:16:59.960 --> 3:17:06.120]  UdoNews.com and other things. And so what we do is we never quit YouTube. We, we battle there,
[3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:10.520]  but we battle on other fronts as well. But what I'm saying is don't buy the line that corporate
[3:17:10.520 --> 3:17:16.200]  media has told us that, oh, we got to go viral. Think about this. You produced one of the greatest
[3:17:16.200 --> 3:17:21.560]  documentaries, in my opinion, in the Obama deception. All right. Now, hundreds of thousands,
[3:17:21.560 --> 3:17:26.120]  millions of people have watched that. And they got to watch it for free. That's wonderful. And
[3:17:26.120 --> 3:17:29.880]  that's great. And we all love your heart. We love your commitment. We love the thought that,
[3:17:29.880 --> 3:17:33.320]  hey, you just want to get the information out into the hands of the people because, you know,
[3:17:33.320 --> 3:17:38.920]  you know, the truth sets people free. But at the same time, I believe every laborer is worth their
[3:17:38.920 --> 3:17:44.920]  heart and that you should be paid and compensated for the work that you do. So once again, you can
[3:17:44.920 --> 3:17:49.160]  continue to put them on YouTube all you want. That's good. But once our ad revenue starts to go up,
[3:17:49.160 --> 3:17:53.880]  people may want to think twice about putting them anywhere but UdoNews because at least you're
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:58.360]  getting paid for every time someone views. No, no, I think it's great. And then that funds your
[3:17:58.360 --> 3:18:03.480]  operation. I'm just able to fund it with DVD sales. Unfortunately, as the free quality gets
[3:18:03.480 --> 3:18:07.800]  better and better on the web, we see the DVD sales go down, but we've got other ways of raising
[3:18:07.800 --> 3:18:13.160]  money. And I do see it in the future a couple years from now, where we may not be able to operate
[3:18:13.160 --> 3:18:18.680]  because one DVD gets sold and it's free everywhere in that same quality. I'm kind of destroying
[3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:22.840]  myself, but we don't have any future anyways. If I don't, but no, that's what's great about
[3:18:22.840 --> 3:18:28.360]  Udo News and the rest of them. That's why we sell t-shirts and sell the DVDs and hope people will
[3:18:28.360 --> 3:18:32.680]  buy them so they have them in the higher quality at infowars.com or get things going.
[3:18:32.680 --> 3:18:36.360]  You're going to get the best of all worlds. You can continue to do what you've been doing,
[3:18:36.360 --> 3:18:40.520]  but you can also be getting that residual. Check this thing. Years from now, when the
[3:18:40.520 --> 3:18:44.280]  Obama deception is still getting viewed, those are count towards your clicks,
[3:18:44.280 --> 3:18:48.760]  towards the total percentage that you get paid for the news you do. So you'll get the best of
[3:18:48.760 --> 3:18:53.320]  all worlds. Like once again, my heart is in this, not for the money, the love of money,
[3:18:53.320 --> 3:18:56.680]  the root of all evil. Now I love people and I care about my country.
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:18:59.480]  Yeah, but Darrell, I know because you've been a big contributor actually to this office. People
[3:18:59.480 --> 3:19:03.000]  don't even know about that. And you've owned quite a few big successful companies. And I'm
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:06.920]  glad you're doing this. You don't have to explain that. But it is true to get people paid,
[3:19:06.920 --> 3:19:11.960]  will actually generate more. And we need to fund ourselves. The globalists take our money and taxes
[3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:16.600]  and use it against us and then try to tell us we can't hang a sign up on a street corner.
[3:19:16.600 --> 3:19:21.720]  But the president tells his minions they can. So we need to get our own media a great look.
[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:27.800]  Looks like YouTube. Actually, that's good. Udo news.com. And it's a genius name. And Darrell,
[3:19:27.800 --> 3:19:33.400]  I know you've run multi-million dollar, you know, 50, 60, 100 million dollar companies a year.
[3:19:33.400 --> 3:19:37.480]  I forget some of your companies are bigger than that. And you've been arrested for preaching
[3:19:37.480 --> 3:19:41.480]  the gospel in Dallas. I've seen that in the news. And so where are your great work? We're gonna
[3:19:41.480 --> 3:19:47.240]  come back. Talk more about this. You do news. You do news.com. We're just here supporting
[3:19:47.240 --> 3:19:51.720]  alternative media and other venues coming up. We got the gentleman who wore the gun on his side.
[3:19:51.720 --> 3:19:55.720]  And Chris Matthews flipped out. That's coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show as well.
[3:19:55.720 --> 3:20:00.040]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen, prisonplanet.tv is our subscription video site.
[3:20:01.160 --> 3:20:05.720]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[3:20:05.720 --> 3:20:10.280]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago. He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson
[3:20:10.280 --> 3:20:15.000]  very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:19.640]  he appreciates you every day, there is no job security. You are always in danger of losing
[3:20:19.640 --> 3:20:25.560]  your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business. Since you are the boss,
[3:20:25.560 --> 3:20:31.720]  nobody can fire you. So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years. And he is passionate about
[3:20:31.720 --> 3:20:36.920]  turning other people onto the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[3:20:36.920 --> 3:20:41.800]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of
[3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:46.040]  healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive
[3:20:46.040 --> 3:20:52.040]  compounding monthly income. Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity. That's
[3:20:52.040 --> 3:20:57.800]  chocolate.ownmyself.com. It takes very little money. And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk
[3:20:57.800 --> 3:21:04.360]  to you. Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com. If you'd like to play poker, crafts, or roulette at home

[3:22:07.560 --> 3:22:13.480]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[3:22:13.480 --> 3:22:18.840]  What their objective would be world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:22:19.480 --> 3:22:25.480]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:22:25.480 --> 3:22:33.720]  of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[3:22:33.720 --> 3:22:39.080]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:22:39.080 --> 3:22:42.840]  Builderberg is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[3:22:42.840 --> 3:22:46.200]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their
[3:22:46.200 --> 3:22:55.720]  after easy. Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:22:55.720 --> 3:22:59.800]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[3:23:01.160 --> 3:23:05.720]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[3:23:05.720 --> 3:23:09.560]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:23:09.560 --> 3:23:14.840]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:23:14.840 --> 3:23:18.920]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:21.880]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it?
[3:23:21.880 --> 3:23:25.400]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[3:23:25.400 --> 3:23:29.480]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[3:23:29.480 --> 3:23:33.960]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[3:23:33.960 --> 3:23:39.560]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:43.720]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[3:23:43.720 --> 3:23:52.120]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[3:23:52.120 --> 3:24:18.040]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[3:24:18.040 --> 3:24:34.840]  We got a news report that Michael Jordan on 9-11 will be inducted into the basketball hall of fame
[3:24:34.840 --> 3:24:41.240]  and that's going to be part of Obama's 9-11 memorial. So notice why America's dumbed out
[3:24:41.240 --> 3:24:45.160]  and fallen apart. Our heroes are not inventors, they're not scientists, they're not firemen
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:49.160]  that save kids in burning buildings. It's people that play basketball and football and I'm not
[3:24:49.160 --> 3:24:53.080]  saying you can't like those guys and that's great but the establishment has written in
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:58.440]  documents that they make your hero sports icon so you don't have heroes that really matter.
[3:24:58.440 --> 3:25:03.640]  And then kids stop wanting to be an inventor or a scientist or a doctor. They want to be a basketball
[3:25:03.640 --> 3:25:08.760]  player and there's only a few slots for that and it's this lottery economy. You see them
[3:25:09.720 --> 3:25:14.520]  on CNN they had this thing where for 30 seconds you beg for a job and then only certain people
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:21.880]  can get the slot and it's all about, you know, you got hope and change and you're rolling the dice.
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:28.840]  George Arwell talks about that in 1984. Very, very sick society. No, we need to take action ourselves.
[3:25:29.480 --> 3:25:32.920]  So many people talk about the government and the corruption but they don't get involved.
[3:25:32.920 --> 3:25:39.000]  Start with videos. Start with websites. Start with audio blogs. So Darryl Runders,
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:43.480]  I can't wait till YouDoNews.com gets launched. What are some of your other websites you can plug
[3:25:43.480 --> 3:25:49.320]  today? Hey, you know, don't forget, I am still giving 20 grand away for anybody who can name the
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:55.880]  10 commandments and 20 seconds or less. So we give that away in October. So go to 10andwin.com.
[3:25:59.160 --> 3:26:05.000]  Now, what's the catch? 10andwin.com. Why is it so hard, Darryl, to do 20 seconds?
[3:26:07.160 --> 3:26:11.800]  No, I can't do it. Exactly. But I mean, I can certainly read it and train and probably. Well,
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:16.200]  there you go. So I'm giving everyone an incentive to get back to the basics and the most fundamental.
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:19.400]  So how does somebody win then? I mean, if it's so, if it's easy,
[3:26:20.040 --> 3:26:22.200]  then how do you pick the one person? A whole bunch of winners.
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:24.840]  Well, we put a video up there to train you in two minutes, how to learn,
[3:26:24.840 --> 3:26:28.600]  how to list the law and order 20 seconds or less. And then in October, I forget the day,
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:32.360]  you'll have to go to the website and check. I'm going to get on the phone, start drawing names
[3:26:32.360 --> 3:26:37.720]  of those who registered one by one. First one I get on the phone. That can do it. Get 20 grand.
[3:26:37.720 --> 3:26:41.480]  That's simple. Oh, that's great. That is certainly a good thing you're doing.
[3:26:41.480 --> 3:26:44.280]  I know you're good for it. You've certainly helped what we're doing here.
[3:26:44.920 --> 3:26:49.880]  Hey, I just wondered before we part ways, Alex, I just once again want to let everybody know,
[3:26:49.880 --> 3:26:53.800]  I thank God for you and I know I speak for many others out there. It's not easy doing what you're
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:58.280]  doing. You're constantly being attacked. But remember, man, you catch both the flag when
[3:26:58.280 --> 3:27:02.360]  you're over the target. So you just keep pushing that file. You don't even think of looking back.
[3:27:03.560 --> 3:27:07.000]  Well, that is certainly the fact, Darryl. And as soon as you launch the site, we'll have you
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:11.160]  back up. You don't have to come down to Austin from Dallas to be in studio. But if you want to,
[3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:15.560]  that'd be great. And I can't wait. I'm glad you're doing this to get the word out.
[3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:23.480]  udonews.com. You with just a U, udonews.com, up on screen at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:27:23.480 --> 3:27:27.560]  Hey, in one last, hey, in one last thought, remind people, you guys listening, that as
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:32.600]  an independent news journalist with Udo News, that gives you access as the press,
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:37.640]  to press passes, to get you into these events like Obama's going to be speaking at with Michael
[3:27:37.640 --> 3:27:41.640]  Jordan. So we'll be able to hook people up with those press passes. Sometimes you'll
[3:27:41.640 --> 3:27:45.320]  spend it on the event, have to pass a background check and get on the police report list. But
[3:27:46.280 --> 3:27:50.040]  if you're willing and you're qualified, then we can get you on into those events. We can get you
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:53.400]  into all those sporting events to interview. Now, that's the exciting thing. People can do that
[3:27:53.400 --> 3:27:57.880]  with Udo News or iChallenge. People start their own news site, have it sound official and do it.
[3:27:57.880 --> 3:28:04.680]  People ask how we get big guests on. We call their publicist and say, hey, we see they got a new
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:09.880]  book out. You know, can we have this astronaut or this person on? That's how we do it. People
[3:28:09.880 --> 3:28:15.320]  think I like to do some secret handshake to get a big guest on, but it's called the telephone.
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:22.040]  I mean, you pick it up and you dial them and you get them on. And that's how everything's
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:25.480]  done in the world. You just take action. But Darrell, what do you think of the Southern
[3:28:25.480 --> 3:28:31.240]  Parbury Law Center and others coming right out and attacking Oathkeepers, attacking me? I mean,
[3:28:31.240 --> 3:28:35.880]  this is really getting scary. They are really getting ready to stage something. I think you're
[3:28:35.880 --> 3:28:41.960]  right. But remember, desperate people do desperate things. So that just reveals, I think, to you
[3:28:41.960 --> 3:28:46.760]  and everybody else who's in the know that they're desperate. They're desperate. Now, we definitely
[3:28:46.760 --> 3:28:51.720]  need to be on guard because, you know, desperate people do do desperate things and we don't know
[3:28:51.720 --> 3:28:57.080]  how desperate are they really. But the fact that they're trying to discredit you and ruin you or
[3:28:57.080 --> 3:29:02.680]  me or anybody that's ever associated with you, then that's actually a good thing. So look,
[3:29:02.680 --> 3:29:06.120]  they did the same thing to crime. So you're in good company.
[3:29:08.600 --> 3:29:12.840]  Absolutely. Darrell Runders will talk to you as soon as udonews.com gets fully launched.
[3:29:12.840 --> 3:29:17.960]  Hey, man, I'm going to leave you with one last scripture. Remember James 417. Anyone who knows
[3:29:17.960 --> 3:29:24.920]  the good they ought to do and they don't do it is a sin. So get up, get out, get busy doing something
[3:29:24.920 --> 3:29:31.000]  to take our country back. Absolutely. Darrell, good to hear from you. Take care, Alex. God bless.
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:35.240]  You bet. God bless you. When we come back, we're going to talk to the gentlemen that got attacked
[3:29:35.240 --> 3:29:42.040]  by Chris Matthews as a thought criminal wearing that gun yesterday down the street from an event
[3:29:42.040 --> 3:29:48.600]  that Lord Obama was going to be attending for death care. The death committees, which really do exist.
[3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:58.280]  We'll be right back. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:00.920 --> 3:30:05.560]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you
[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:10.920]  really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[3:30:10.920 --> 3:30:16.120]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many of
[3:30:16.120 --> 3:30:20.520]  these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system
[3:30:20.520 --> 3:30:25.960]  diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a
[3:30:25.960 --> 3:30:30.920]  low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Acola Blue 28

[3:31:00.040 --> 3:31:06.200]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:31:06.200 --> 3:31:10.680]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[3:31:10.680 --> 3:31:15.800]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:31:15.800 --> 3:31:20.120]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products

[3:33:03.720 --> 3:33:08.200]  Let's ask about the presidency and what he's trying to do with healthcare. You brought a loaded gun,
[3:33:08.200 --> 3:33:13.240]  was your gun loaded today? Wow, who would be silly enough to carry an unloaded firearm?
[3:33:13.240 --> 3:33:17.480]  I'm only asking your answer to the questions. Who's yelling, okay, that's what I'm saying.
[3:33:17.480 --> 3:33:21.320]  Why did you bring a loaded gun to a public meeting? Well, here in New Hampshire,
[3:33:22.120 --> 3:33:26.520]  I know the law, you can chew gum at church, you can do it, you can ride in on a pogo stick,
[3:33:26.520 --> 3:33:30.280]  there's a lot of things you're legally allowed to do. Why did you bring a gun to a meeting with
[3:33:30.280 --> 3:33:33.960]  the president of the United States, given the violent history of this country with regard to
[3:33:33.960 --> 3:33:39.080]  presidents and assassinations? Why'd you bring a gun to a public event with the president?
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:43.720]  You know the history of this country. If you love this country, you know its history.
[3:33:43.720 --> 3:33:48.520]  You know about a problem with people with guns and presidential events. Why'd you bring a gun
[3:33:48.520 --> 3:33:56.280]  to an event with the president? I do know history and the history is that our forefathers fought
[3:33:56.280 --> 3:34:00.520]  for the right to keep and bear armed and they believe that every person should be armed.
[3:34:00.520 --> 3:34:05.560]  Everybody knows that. Okay, well then why did you bring a gun to a presidential event today?
[3:34:05.560 --> 3:34:09.640]  That's not even a relevant question. The question is why don't people bear arms these days?
[3:34:10.280 --> 3:34:14.280]  Okay, let's ask, okay, you brought a sign that said the Tree of Liberty has to be
[3:34:14.280 --> 3:34:20.120]  watered with the blood of tyrants and you're carrying a goddamn gun at a presidential event.
[3:34:20.120 --> 3:34:24.440]  I think those things make people wonder what you're about. Right, the sign didn't say anything
[3:34:24.440 --> 3:34:30.120]  about blood. What did it say? It's time to water the Tree of Liberty. And where did that come from?
[3:34:30.120 --> 3:34:33.400]  That line? It's a quote from Thomas Jefferson. And what's the rest of the line?
[3:34:33.400 --> 3:34:37.960]  No, the rest of the line is for people to look up. It's not a soundbite. They need to understand
[3:34:37.960 --> 3:34:43.000]  the context. What's the rest of the line from Jefferson? The Tree of Liberty must be refreshed
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:47.000]  from time to time with the blood of tyrants and patriots. Okay, well you're carrying a gun and
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:51.400]  you're carrying that sign and you don't think people should worry about you? No, I don't think
[3:34:51.400 --> 3:34:55.400]  people should worry about me. Well, let me ask you about the history of people that carry guns,
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:35:01.720]  depressional events. Tell me that history, sir. Are you speaking of a particular event?
[3:35:01.720 --> 3:35:06.200]  I'm talking about people who bring guns to presidential events in history. Tell me their
[3:35:06.200 --> 3:35:10.520]  history. I'll tell you this, Chris. We just started New History. I was there today.
[3:35:10.520 --> 3:35:15.720]  Are you starting a new history? There was a peaceful, a peaceful rally. No one was injured.
[3:35:15.720 --> 3:35:27.720]  Okay, well, on our side was a lot of people in New Hampshire are used to fighting. You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[3:35:28.600 --> 3:35:33.720]  I want to thank Jared for staying up here late last night to get ahold of William Costrick. When I first
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:38.680]  heard the news reporting this, it was like, guy with an airpiece out there with a gun right in front of
[3:35:38.680 --> 3:35:43.400]  Obama. No, he was down the street at a private rally in New Hampshire where they're trying to
[3:35:43.400 --> 3:35:48.440]  reclaim their liberty by openly demonstrating the Second Amendment. That's how you get it back.
[3:35:48.440 --> 3:35:52.600]  They've got us to hide in our houses with it to where now every day or two, I see an article,
[3:35:52.600 --> 3:35:57.560]  some old man working on his rifle in his garage and the neighbors in Texas call the police and
[3:35:57.560 --> 3:36:03.240]  they come arrest him or in Illinois or anywhere. So William Costrick does have a lot of courage to
[3:36:03.240 --> 3:36:08.440]  do that. Some other fellow today, hours before Obama even arrived in New Hampshire, they arrested
[3:36:08.440 --> 3:36:12.760]  him saying, was he legal to have a gun without a permit? You don't have to have a permit to
[3:36:12.760 --> 3:36:17.640]  have a gun in New Hampshire or most states. So that just illustrates what he's talking about.
[3:36:17.640 --> 3:36:22.440]  He's with the Free States Project. He had a big Restore the Republic sign. We talked to Gary
[3:36:22.440 --> 3:36:26.280]  Franche yesterday, Kurt Nemo did and said, no, no, we know that guy. He really is a patriot.
[3:36:26.280 --> 3:36:31.560]  But with all these setups and the ADL and Simon Wiesenthal Center and also the,
[3:36:32.280 --> 3:36:36.920]  mainly the Southern Prairie Law Center demonizing me and others, we're looking for them to stage
[3:36:36.920 --> 3:36:40.760]  something. So that's what we're concerned about. But Mr. Costrick, it's good to have you on with
[3:36:40.760 --> 3:36:48.040]  us today. It's good to be with you. It's good to have you here. Tell us about yourself. Tell us
[3:36:48.040 --> 3:36:55.000]  where you really were, what you were doing. I've seen very few people do as well with Chris Matthews
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:59.480]  because he won't let you talk and since they're attacking you. I think you've cleaned
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:03.720]  Chris Matthews clock almost as good as when we went and shut him down with a bullhorn. But
[3:37:03.720 --> 3:37:07.560]  you know, that's one in a million. Thanks to the great demonstrators. But no, no, seriously,
[3:37:07.560 --> 3:37:11.800]  one on one. You did a great job. I don't think I could have done a job as good as you did being
[3:37:11.800 --> 3:37:18.680]  calm. Well, that weasel was talking to you. Well, I gotta tell you, I was sweating. It was rough.
[3:37:18.680 --> 3:37:25.480]  He's good at what he does. I don't hold him any ill will. I feel a lot of people wrote some nasty
[3:37:25.480 --> 3:37:29.560]  things about him. You know, fact is the name of the show is hardball. That's what he does.
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:36.360]  That's what I expected walking in. I've been in sales for a while. I have a little bit of
[3:37:36.360 --> 3:37:42.360]  experience public speaking. So that helped out. But even so, it was it was pretty brutal. And
[3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:46.440]  I was I was glad watching it afterwards. That everything went as well as it did.
[3:37:48.040 --> 3:37:53.080]  Absolutely. People can watch the whole clip up on info wars.com and prison planet.com.
[3:37:53.080 --> 3:37:57.960]  Tell us about what you actually saw out at the event. And then what made you think I'm going
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:38:04.840]  to go wear a sidearm on my side. And I'm going to have a sign saying water the tree of liberty.
[3:38:04.840 --> 3:38:15.720]  You know, it's a it's a it's a fortuitous confluence of events. I was at some other
[3:38:15.720 --> 3:38:22.440]  activism in the state and was having a conversation with some folks. I wasn't even actually aware
[3:38:22.440 --> 3:38:29.400]  of the visit of the rally. And it was it was just the day before they said,
[3:38:29.400 --> 3:38:35.160]  you know, he's coming in. It's going to be a big deal. And I'm like, well, you know,
[3:38:35.160 --> 3:38:40.120]  someone should someone should be there open caring. And everybody kind of looked at me
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:44.760]  like I was a little off. And I said, well, you know, I will then I'll go do it. And
[3:38:45.400 --> 3:38:52.120]  what you're doing is so revolutionary that that I mean, people went out on this. And even in
[3:38:52.120 --> 3:38:56.600]  Texas now, if you're trying to walk with a shotgun on by your own ranch down the side of a highway,
[3:38:56.600 --> 3:39:01.320]  a cop will pull up and ask what you're doing in America. No one dare carry a rifle in the back
[3:39:01.320 --> 3:39:06.520]  of their pickup truck anymore. Just 15 years ago, you saw it everywhere. They're killing our culture.
[3:39:06.520 --> 3:39:11.080]  You and others, I know Vermont, New Hampshire, Arizona, a few other states, people are open
[3:39:11.080 --> 3:39:16.440]  carrying everywhere, Colorado, and the and the slaves are having to learn that this is
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:24.440]  their right. And I saw a violence policy center Brady, a gun grab group on MSNBC this morning.
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:28.440]  They were talking about you and others viciously how dangerous it is. But see,
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:33.880]  they've got all their armed police and all their weapons. They're threatened by their slaves.
[3:39:33.880 --> 3:39:40.200]  They're like Bengal tigers in the jungles of India, not liking to see a little deer suddenly
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:45.720]  grow big claws and fangs. So we are their food. And of course they're going to want us to be
[3:39:45.720 --> 3:39:50.120]  declawed and defanged before they drop out of a tree like a boa constrictor and have their way
[3:39:50.120 --> 3:39:57.480]  with us. Yeah, it's interesting because the truth is, I don't know the exact number, but I think
[3:39:57.480 --> 3:40:04.600]  over 40 states, it's legal to open carry in, but the vast majority of those you don't dare unless
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:11.000]  you want to get your face slammed into the ground. And New Hampshire is a place where you still
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:18.200]  generally can. As activists, we have had a few incidents, nothing brutal, but minor
[3:40:18.200 --> 3:40:24.040]  harassment. And we've gone, spoke to the police chief, spoke to the media, spoke to the mayor
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:31.720]  and educated them on that everyone who's carrying a firearm is not a criminal. And that's why it's
[3:40:31.720 --> 3:40:38.840]  important for people to do it regularly, to be seen doing it so that people don't make the assumption
[3:40:38.840 --> 3:40:43.240]  when they see a firearm that it's a criminal. They need to see it so often that when they
[3:40:43.240 --> 3:40:48.600]  see it, the assumption is that's a law by the citizen. That's my neighbor. That's a guy that I can
[3:40:48.600 --> 3:40:55.400]  trust. Well, what you're doing is, is revolutionary as it gets to restore the Republic. And Mr.
[3:40:55.400 --> 3:41:03.720]  Kostrak, I can only commend what you're doing. How I'm glad that I'm glad that you guys were,
[3:41:03.720 --> 3:41:08.760]  that you, I guess, were able to talk to Gary and clear up at least on your site, this whole
[3:41:08.760 --> 3:41:15.800]  agent provocateur thing still seems pretty widespread in other areas of the, of the internet.
[3:41:16.440 --> 3:41:21.720]  See, that shows even, I mean, I mean, that shows, well, I mean, we see the feds provocateur stuff
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:26.760]  constantly. And so nine times out of 10 it is, and then to see somebody with incredible courage
[3:41:26.760 --> 3:41:31.880]  like yourself, because it's one thing to do open carry in New Hampshire or Colorado or Vermont
[3:41:31.880 --> 3:41:37.800]  or Arizona at some event or when you're out doing business. But I mean, when the president's coming
[3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:43.800]  around again, just amazing courage on your part. And I don't think it's really an apology, but
[3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:48.280]  more of a correction that, well, we didn't say you were a fed for sure. We said, we'll find out,
[3:41:48.280 --> 3:41:53.480]  and we did man, and then corrected it. Again, your bold courage and Thomas Jefferson spirit
[3:41:54.440 --> 3:41:59.960]  just, you know, really puts us to shame. So we commend you. But absolutely. What was it like
[3:41:59.960 --> 3:42:03.720]  when you were out there? What was it like? You were talking to the fellow who was out there,
[3:42:03.720 --> 3:42:07.960]  I guess a few blocks away from where Obama was at on private property with a handgun
[3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:15.640]  strapped to his hip, to his thigh and the water, the tree of liberty quote from Thomas Jefferson.
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:24.760]  I was in the thick of the protesting area for a good half hour, 40 minutes, I don't know,
[3:42:24.760 --> 3:42:32.600]  at least a half an hour. And many of the the state police, the local police, they'd walked past me
[3:42:32.600 --> 3:42:41.480]  numerous times, countless times already at, you know, I'm there holding my sign. And then we see
[3:42:42.360 --> 3:42:47.320]  them moving through the crowd, looking down. And someone said to me, oh, they're checking
[3:42:47.320 --> 3:42:53.000]  people's hands. And of course, I knew at that moment that no, they're looking for me. So I,
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:43:00.040]  you know, I just waited there with my sign. And the gentleman who came up to me, Lieutenant
[3:43:00.040 --> 3:43:06.760]  McDonald, was very cordial, extremely polite. I saw someone say on one of the comments that, oh,
[3:43:06.760 --> 3:43:10.440]  if a cop sees someone with a gun at something like this, they don't just walk up and say,
[3:43:10.440 --> 3:43:15.000]  hi, well, that's exactly what happened. He walked up, he introduced himself. He said,
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:20.360]  would you mind stepping off to the side and speaking with me? I did. We have video of the
[3:43:20.360 --> 3:43:26.760]  entire encounter from the time he walked up to the end of it. Very cordial, very polite.
[3:43:26.760 --> 3:43:31.720]  Is that posted yet? I'd like to play that here because we're also doing a TV show right now.
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  It is nowhere online as of right now. We need to get that up on YouTube. We've been working on
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:45.480]  that. We've been working on it. Well, good. Good. Can't wait to see that. Actually,
[3:43:45.480 --> 3:43:50.200]  there were several cameras on team. Good. Is there a website that we should look for it to
[3:43:50.200 --> 3:43:57.720]  surface on? Not yet. Okay. Well, I mean, on YouTube, what are you going to call the video? Patriot?
[3:44:01.240 --> 3:44:05.960]  Wow. What do you suggest? No, no, I'm just thinking because I want to post it on InfoWars
[3:44:05.960 --> 3:44:10.440]  and Prison Planet as soon as it comes up, William. Now, well, as soon as we get it taken
[3:44:10.440 --> 3:44:14.520]  care of, you'll be the first to know. Okay, we're awesome. I'll send you an update.
[3:44:15.320 --> 3:44:19.720]  You bet. Well, I always talk about how we've got to save the gun culture by exercising it openly
[3:44:19.720 --> 3:44:22.920]  because, I mean, it's gotten the point in Texas where a carpenter comes to your house
[3:44:22.920 --> 3:44:27.720]  and sees a gun case and calls the cops because they live on TV land. And they think because
[3:44:27.720 --> 3:44:32.360]  everything's based in New York and Chicago on these dramas that those cop shows are real.
[3:44:32.360 --> 3:44:37.560]  The general public thinks those actors are real people. I mean, the public's like literally
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:41.720]  under mind control. And so they come to your house and think your guns are illegal. So what
[3:44:41.720 --> 3:44:47.640]  you're doing is invaluable. But what was it like once the national media contacted you? Were you
[3:44:47.640 --> 3:44:52.600]  like, how did you do that? I mean, Chris Matthews didn't know what to do. The fact that we're not
[3:44:52.600 --> 3:44:59.640]  cowed, that you're not cowed, that people are breaking their spell was just so and that you
[3:44:59.640 --> 3:45:08.040]  weren't apologetic to him. It was just devastating. Well, the way it went down. Yeah, unremorseful.
[3:45:08.040 --> 3:45:13.240]  I think that's the way I'm labeled on the Ariana Huffington site. Amazingly enough.
[3:45:13.240 --> 3:45:23.160]  So yeah, what happened is he went ahead and asked me to, if I was aware of the federal law
[3:45:23.160 --> 3:45:27.800]  1000 feet from a school, I said that I was, that there were exceptions to that, that I was an
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:36.680]  exception to that. And he called it in. He said basically that that doesn't matter that because
[3:45:36.680 --> 3:45:41.800]  it's a school is that they can ask me to leave. And if I refuse to leave, then I would be arrested.
[3:45:41.800 --> 3:45:44.440]  In fact, for, for trespassing.
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:46.920]  Also, the cop said this to you.
[3:45:47.720 --> 3:45:51.800]  I mean, he did. Once again, I, you know, he was, he very polite. He, you know,
[3:45:51.800 --> 3:45:56.760]  he was calling in, checking, checking back with, you know, whoever was in charge there.
[3:45:56.760 --> 3:46:00.760]  And, but you can't have a slave or the gun near the emperor. Okay.
[3:46:01.400 --> 3:46:06.280]  Well, he did say we're going to have to move you a 1000 feet. And then this is where this,
[3:46:06.280 --> 3:46:11.640]  this is where things just got really amazing because I said, well, okay, I mean, where is
[3:46:11.640 --> 3:46:19.640]  the 1000 foot line? And he didn't know. So he got on the phone and then started trying to find out.
[3:46:20.280 --> 3:46:26.280]  Meanwhile, there's been such a ruckus that these news agencies are starting to come up and talk to
[3:46:26.280 --> 3:46:32.040]  me. So actually it took him about 10 to 12 minutes to get an answer back. Meanwhile, I'm
[3:46:32.040 --> 3:46:36.680]  conducting interviews with the Boston Globe, the New York Post. I mean, I mean, they're coming up
[3:46:36.680 --> 3:46:43.560]  right there. And so he comes back and, and he says, he says, well, we're going to ask you to
[3:46:43.560 --> 3:46:50.040]  move down to the end of the block past the barricade. And I said, well, that's, that's more
[3:46:50.040 --> 3:46:55.000]  than 1000 feet. And he's like, well, I don't really know where the 1000 feet is, but that's
[3:46:55.000 --> 3:47:00.360]  what we're going to ask you to do. And he said, I can't even tell you if I would arrest you if
[3:47:00.360 --> 3:47:09.320]  you refuse to do that. Because, you know, he was, he was clearly not wanting to arrest me. And he
[3:47:09.320 --> 3:47:14.840]  wasn't going to do so unless ordered to buy higher ups is the impression that I was getting.
[3:47:16.280 --> 3:47:22.680]  So at this point, I had to make a judgment judgment call. And I was undecided as to what
[3:47:22.680 --> 3:47:28.760]  the what the right thing to do here was. At that time, he got a call on his cell phone. And
[3:47:28.760 --> 3:47:41.080]  who exactly it was, not 100%. I believe that it was the police chief, who came through and said
[3:47:41.080 --> 3:47:46.520]  that apparently, right, maybe 30 feet from where I was currently standing when this whole incident
[3:47:46.520 --> 3:47:52.040]  started, that there was a church and that church was private property. And therefore, I would be
[3:47:52.040 --> 3:47:59.560]  all right there. So instead of pushing the 1000 foot permit issue, I just moved over and that's
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:04.760]  where I stood through the for the rest of the event. Well, the issue here is we've been trained
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:09.720]  by the police that we can't have our rifles in our cars. There's no law. They'll just beat you in
[3:48:09.720 --> 3:48:13.880]  the head with a club and find something to take you to prison for. We have to teach them that's
[3:48:13.880 --> 3:48:19.960]  illegal and criminal, even in Texas, we've been castrated. You obviously haven't been in Vermont,
[3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:27.720]  Arizona, and New Hampshire and a few areas of Colorado. I commend you. It's just amazing. We
[3:48:27.720 --> 3:48:32.040]  should start a national organization. Somebody should for having these events in numbers.
[3:48:32.760 --> 3:48:36.760]  I know the Black Panthers and I support what they did in Houston, marched armed
[3:48:37.880 --> 3:48:40.840]  because this is our right of free humans. And if we allow them through
[3:48:40.840 --> 3:48:49.080]  through the common law to restrict us, practice is a large part of the law.
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:56.840]  And it becomes the common law. Go ahead. Exactly. And, and, and, and you're absolutely right. And
[3:48:56.840 --> 3:49:00.920]  I lived in Arizona. I came from Arizona and I moved to New Hampshire as part of the free state
[3:49:00.920 --> 3:49:07.320]  project to work to achieve liberty in our lifetime. And New Hampshire is not a Arizona is not a half
[3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:11.960]  bad state when it comes to gun laws, right? But they started doing the, uh, they were one of the
[3:49:11.960 --> 3:49:18.760]  first states to go with the real ID. We had governor Napolitano and, uh, the, I, I saw what
[3:49:18.760 --> 3:49:23.240]  was happening in New Hampshire and I said, you know, that's the last bastion of freedom. This
[3:49:23.240 --> 3:49:29.160]  is where the nanny status, uh, don't want to be, right? Yeah, we have to want to be made. This
[3:49:29.160 --> 3:49:36.600]  is the state that has no state income tax. It's the last state that has no seatbelt laws. It has
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:41.400]  no mandatory insurance. I mean, there's so many things that the, that the, the live for your
[3:49:41.400 --> 3:49:48.040]  die state, the spirit of the locals, they live that way. Yeah, we have to make it the custom.
[3:49:48.040 --> 3:49:54.120]  Again, we have to practice and exercise these freedoms or they add to fee and die to the point
[3:49:54.120 --> 3:49:58.040]  of now you got to hide your guns with repair people in Texas because they think they're
[3:49:58.040 --> 3:50:02.520]  illegal and they want a bounty. The billboards everywhere say report illegal guns, show a
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:08.520]  picture of a revolver, the moron public, uh, doesn't know that. And so thank God for you,
[3:50:08.520 --> 3:50:13.880]  millions of people yesterday all over international TV learned that wait, you're allowed to have a
[3:50:13.880 --> 3:50:19.080]  gun. And so maybe when I have an exterminator in my house, he won't go call the police on me.
[3:50:19.720 --> 3:50:24.920]  So I just saw the headline coming out of England where apparently I am labeled a gunman.
[3:50:24.920 --> 3:50:30.920]  And interestingly in some of the, uh, articles that I read, I'm labeled a loner. Um, so I've
[3:50:30.920 --> 3:50:35.800]  been labeled a loner and a gunman, but so, but so far not a lone gunman. So we'll see if that
[3:50:35.800 --> 3:50:39.960]  you fire magic bullets that can shoot through two or three people through a bunch of bones
[3:50:39.960 --> 3:50:44.840]  in metal and not be damaged. Maybe you're met and maybe you're like the lucky charms, uh,
[3:50:44.840 --> 3:50:50.040]  leprechaun that you go hop around like the fighting iris with gold coins shooting out of
[3:50:50.040 --> 3:50:54.040]  your mouth. Say there, Mr. Costrick, I want to get a few final comments from you. Maybe have
[3:50:54.040 --> 3:50:57.960]  you up for a full hour in the near future. You're a very interesting person and New Hampshire sounds
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:01.720]  like a better, better place to live.

[3:52:04.600 --> 3:52:10.920]  humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the
[3:52:10.920 --> 3:52:16.600]  kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely
[3:52:16.600 --> 3:52:21.000]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:21.000 --> 3:52:25.480]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one of this election.
[3:52:25.480 --> 3:52:30.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.760 --> 3:52:36.440]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.600 --> 3:52:44.280]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[3:52:44.280 --> 3:52:51.800]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[3:53:04.760 --> 3:53:09.880]  also known as RFID chips in millions of passports credit cards and licenses? In the current state
[3:53:09.880 --> 3:53:14.360]  of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased. With current technology,
[3:53:14.360 --> 3:53:18.360]  thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to steal your credit card number
[3:53:18.360 --> 3:53:22.600]  and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse. Think of this identity theft
[3:53:22.600 --> 3:53:27.080]  device as a garage door opener. You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[3:53:27.080 --> 3:53:31.560]  Thieves get near you. Push a button and these tiny radios give out personal information.

[3:54:10.120 --> 3:54:15.960]  William Costrick, we've got to have him back up soon. I noticed a line. They arrested a guy
[3:54:15.960 --> 3:54:22.360]  in New Hampshire hours before Obama even got there, somewhere near where he was going to speak.
[3:54:22.360 --> 3:54:27.080]  They're looking in cars for guns and they said he was arrested for not having a registered gun.
[3:54:27.080 --> 3:54:31.800]  There's no registry law in New Hampshire so I wanted to ask Mr. Costrick about that. I kept
[3:54:31.800 --> 3:54:37.240]  saying hearing in the news your gun was registered. Let me guess, there's no reason to register a gun
[3:54:37.240 --> 3:54:42.600]  when there's no law to register it. That's more of that mass lie as if the whole country is New
[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:46.760]  York City and lower Manhattan. Let me guess, your gun wasn't registered and it was all a lie.
[3:54:47.640 --> 3:54:53.080]  That is correct. That is correct. My gun was neither registered nor was it required to be
[3:54:53.080 --> 3:55:01.160]  and interestingly, to the horror of many out there, they didn't at no point even ask me for ID.
[3:55:02.600 --> 3:55:06.600]  At no point during the event, during the footage, all the time that I talked to the cops, all the
[3:55:06.600 --> 3:55:14.280]  time that they asked me to relocate the whole thing. I was never even asked for ID.
[3:55:14.280 --> 3:55:17.960]  The truth is, if you were a criminal that wanted to go after the president, it wouldn't be open.
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:22.840]  That's why they have a permit for a concealed because it's illegal under common law to
[3:55:22.840 --> 3:55:28.440]  conceal a weapon. Only criminals and murderers do that. Free men wear weapons openly and we
[3:55:28.440 --> 3:55:33.320]  need to get back to being free men, not slaves in England and others. Those poor people, now
[3:55:33.320 --> 3:55:38.920]  they're putting cameras in the parents rooms, watching them 24 hours a day. That's what happens
[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:43.880]  when they get your guns in Australia, in England. Mr. Costrick, are there any websites you want to
[3:55:43.880 --> 3:55:54.280]  plug? FreeStateProject.org, New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, and start there. There are a dozen
[3:55:54.280 --> 3:56:03.160]  great off the top of my head Liberty activist groups. We're going to do this soon.
[3:56:05.400 --> 3:56:09.080]  William, I got a job. We're going to have you back up for a full hour. I'm going to set you up
[3:56:09.080 --> 3:56:13.240]  for a full hour next week. This is only going to heat up. God bless you and it was good having
[3:56:13.240 --> 3:56:18.360]  you here with us. I've got more looking forward to being back. You bet. We look forward to having
[3:56:18.360 --> 3:56:22.680]  you all have Jaren set you up next week. Thank you. I just want to add before the show ended
[3:56:22.680 --> 3:56:28.280]  that I was just watching CNN during the break that same congressman. They are loving the swastika
[3:56:28.280 --> 3:56:34.440]  on the congressman's sign because he screamed at his constituents and told them they were basically
[3:56:34.440 --> 3:56:41.480]  scum. It backfired and somebody went and sprayed that swastika saving his butt. And I bet if it
[3:56:41.480 --> 3:56:46.600]  does come out in the wash, somebody affiliated with the congressman sprayed that because people
[3:56:46.600 --> 3:56:49.960]  have been caught. We need an article about people being caught putting swastikas on their own
[3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:55.320]  property at the dorms and churches and everywhere else. We're sick of it. And this is what they're
[3:56:55.320 --> 3:57:00.680]  going to do. They're going to victimize themselves to demonize us. Guarantee. We got minute and a
[3:57:00.680 --> 3:57:06.520]  half left. I twisted Ted's arm because gold is up again right now. He still has gold left from
[3:57:06.520 --> 3:57:11.960]  three weeks ago. Gold and silver when gold was almost $60 lower than it is now. And silver was
[3:57:11.960 --> 3:57:16.360]  a couple bucks lower than it is now, but he is almost running out of this. And if it keeps going
[3:57:16.360 --> 3:57:20.360]  up, there's not, I've never seen him extend the offer this long. Quickly, Ted, tell folks about
[3:57:20.360 --> 3:57:24.920]  the coins and the number here at the end of the show. Yeah. Walking Liberty haves right now already.
[3:57:24.920 --> 3:57:33.160]  It's 69. The Frank coin is still currently at 216 and the British sovereign is at 266. All those
[3:57:33.160 --> 3:57:39.560]  coins are relative to gold sitting around 911. Silver closer to $11 an ounce. Of course, we all
[3:57:39.560 --> 3:57:45.880]  know that silver's been poking into 15 and gold into the 960 level. So there's been a great movement
[3:57:45.880 --> 3:57:50.760]  forward and I'm just grateful that there's a couple of little dips in the time here. Just
[3:57:50.760 --> 3:57:56.120]  yesterday I was able to accumulate something else and keep my average cost down. So I want to pass
[3:57:56.120 --> 3:58:05.160]  the savings on the listeners. That's for sure. 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237. The lying media says
[3:58:05.160 --> 3:58:10.200]  don't get gold, but all the wealthy people have been piling in on it. You cannot beat this deal.
[3:58:10.200 --> 3:58:16.040]  800-686-2237. Brokers will be there until midnight tonight and I'm sure taking a hold
[3:58:16.040 --> 3:58:21.880]  of that deal into tomorrow. So don't wait. 800-686-2237. Even if it's a silver half dollar,
[3:58:21.880 --> 3:58:26.200]  a silver dollar, a quarter ounce gold coin, or a hundred ounces of gold, they got your needs.
[3:58:26.200 --> 3:58:33.240]  800-686-2237. Great job, crew. Thank you, Ted. Thank you, Alex. You bet. And great job is John
[3:58:33.240 --> 3:58:37.560]  Harmon up in Minnesota. Up in Mission Control. Great job to Cape Canaveral down here.

[3:58:49.080 --> 3:58:56.040]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:58:56.040 --> 3:59:00.680]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:59:00.680 --> 3:59:05.960]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[3:59:05.960 --> 3:59:11.000]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[3:59:11.000 --> 3:59:15.880]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:59:15.880 --> 3:59:19.960]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[3:59:19.960 --> 3:59:24.120]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[3:59:24.120 --> 3:59:29.240]  weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[3:59:29.240 --> 3:59:33.720]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[3:59:33.720 --> 3:59:40.520]  Science, a long-time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
