[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:33.600]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Thursday July 30th 2015 I'm David Knight your host Alex
[00:33.600 --> 00:38.200]  Jones is going to be joining us with reports of course he's in Europe as we've pointed out this
[00:38.200 --> 00:43.640]  week he's in Europe this week and next week doing reports on the globalist takeover of Europe
[00:43.640 --> 00:48.960]  we've seen what happened in Greece what is going to be happening next in Italy and Spain and
[00:48.960 --> 00:53.800]  Portugal and Ireland these other peripheral countries there what is happening with the
[00:53.800 --> 00:59.480]  move to criminalize the possession of cash so they can do the sorts of currency controls
[00:59.480 --> 01:03.240]  that we've seen in Greece we're also going to have special reports from Paul Joseph Watson
[01:03.240 --> 01:10.320]  our reporter Joe Biggs is on location in Cincinnati to cover this latest murder by
[01:10.320 --> 01:16.680]  the police this particular one was by a campus cop very egregious shooting if you've seen the
[01:16.680 --> 01:23.960]  video a campus cop pulls over black man there's really nothing going on whatsoever but they
[01:23.960 --> 01:29.400]  will show the video you can make up your own mind he has been indicted for murder that's the
[01:29.400 --> 01:34.520]  only good thing that has come out of this we have a lot of news today of course so we reported
[01:34.520 --> 01:40.880]  yesterday that there's a one-man insurgency to bring down John Boehner because the rest of
[01:40.880 --> 01:49.160]  the GOP doesn't really mind how he's betraying his Republican voters we're going to talk about
[01:49.160 --> 01:53.200]  that later on we're going to talk about Hillary Clinton Camille Poglia thinks that she's not
[01:53.200 --> 02:01.720]  even going to make it to the primaries her popularity is plummeting and for good reason we
[02:01.720 --> 02:07.080]  have an article out from Mitt Press actually it's from Counterpunch as carried by Mitt Press
[02:07.080 --> 02:12.520]  talking about Bernie Sanders voting record being antithetical to his purported anti-war stance
[02:12.520 --> 02:18.120]  it was just a couple of days ago that we talked about how even though he's pushing for $15 an
[02:18.120 --> 02:24.960]  hour minimum wage he pays his interns $12 an hour how's that for hypocrisy well even worse
[02:24.960 --> 02:31.560]  especially for many people on the authentic left people who really do care about the proliferation
[02:31.560 --> 02:37.000]  of wars and the consequences that it has for Americans and for others abroad when we get
[02:37.000 --> 02:45.000]  involved in unnecessary wars of empire there's a long list of wars that he has supported virtually
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.240]  all of them going all the way back to Bill Clinton they say that not only is he hawkish not only
[02:51.240 --> 02:57.600]  did he essentially align himself with the Democrats more so than anybody else 98% alignment with the
[02:57.600 --> 03:04.160]  Democrats after he got to the national stage he was rewarded by support from the Democrat
[03:04.160 --> 03:09.440]  party financial support for his positions he supported unequivocally Clinton's military
[03:09.440 --> 03:16.280]  actions in the Kosovo war in 1999 it caused one of his advisors to quit when anti-war activists
[03:16.280 --> 03:22.240]  occupied his office in 1999 because of his support for Clinton's war policies he had them arrested
[03:22.240 --> 03:28.920]  so much for the anti-war socialist candidate we see this all the time of course it was Alexis
[03:28.920 --> 03:36.400]  Cyprus socialist party that really betrayed the people in Greece he offered them the facade
[03:36.400 --> 03:41.600]  of choosing whether they were going to accept the bank or bailout or not and then when they
[03:41.600 --> 03:48.840]  surprised everybody and said no even though you have punished us with taking away our cash
[03:48.840 --> 03:55.080]  shutting down the banks essentially starving us financially for a week they had them under financial
[03:55.080 --> 04:01.520]  siege they still said no we're not going to take that deal but he took it anyway he betrayed the
[04:01.520 --> 04:08.440]  people and now they're actually coming after the finance minister who was trying to work away to
[04:08.440 --> 04:16.680]  keep Greece solvent he actually talked in various forums about how we want to pay back this debt
[04:16.680 --> 04:22.320]  but in order to do that you cannot destroy our economy you need to help us to grow so that we
[04:22.320 --> 04:26.720]  can pay you back these austerity programs that you're proposing and they were proposing even
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.480]  worse austerity programs that had taken 25% of their economy he said under these austerity
[04:31.480 --> 04:35.360]  programs we're not going to be able to pay you back the debt don't you want to work with us so
[04:35.360 --> 04:40.880]  that we can pay back the debt it came up with some novel ideas about how to keep cash flowing and
[04:40.880 --> 04:46.240]  now it looks like they're going to do a criminal prosecution or try to do that of Yanis Verfakis
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.320]  so we'll see what happens we're going to be talking again Alex Jones from Europe Paul Joseph
[04:50.320 --> 04:54.400]  Watson from Europe and Joe Biggs from Cincinnati stay with us we'll be right back
[04:58.560 --> 05:05.520]  as the Senate moves to defund Planned Parenthood sponsors are scrambling to disassociate themselves

[08:26.240 --> 08:30.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this thursday july 30th 2015 i'm david night your
[08:30.720 --> 08:36.160]  host in austin we're going to be joined by alex jones and special reports perhaps live also we
[08:36.160 --> 08:43.280]  have paul joseph watson joining us from europe live paul alex is in europe reporting as i mentioned
[08:43.280 --> 08:47.680]  in the last segment reporting on the globalist takeover of europe things that we have seen in
[08:47.680 --> 08:53.200]  greece things that look like they're going to be coming up with italy with spain perhaps with
[08:53.200 --> 09:00.080]  ireland and portugal the people that the uh germans and others in the center of the european union
[09:00.080 --> 09:06.800]  have called the pigs the pii gs those nations who are now uh we've we've seen what happens
[09:07.760 --> 09:12.320]  with greece now the question is will the other people what will they learn from these lessons
[09:12.320 --> 09:18.000]  and how is this going to move forward how does this all fit into the globalist plan of the trans
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.280]  atlantic partnership as alex had pointed out earlier in the week when he was in london obama
[09:23.280 --> 09:30.480]  was a huge hero there for telling england not to get out of the european union all these different
[09:30.480 --> 09:38.160]  nations especially it's a very strong movement in england the ukip party is dedicated to getting
[09:38.160 --> 09:44.160]  back their sovereignty they did not get into the euro currency but they did get into the european
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.560]  union many people they're not happy about that many people in several european countries are not
[09:48.560 --> 09:52.800]  happy about that there's a lot of independence movements so they don't want the european union
[09:52.800 --> 09:58.240]  to break apart before they can join it to america because that's part of the plan the trans pacific
[09:58.880 --> 10:04.240]  and the transatlantic partnerships are being negotiated in secret the plan is to join all
[10:04.240 --> 10:10.640]  those together it's a sovereignty stealing plan it's not just free trade it's crony capitalism
[10:10.640 --> 10:15.200]  it is something that's going to affect copyright laws it's going to affect your privacy on the
[10:15.200 --> 10:22.000]  internet control the internet these are broad sweeping measures that are getting no exposure
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.400]  whatsoever in terms of what they except for what has been leaked by wiki leaks i want to take a look
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.960]  at an article that really caught my attention today because this is something of course alex
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.680]  jones has talked about for a very long time he was ridiculed as being a tenfold hat conspiracy
[10:37.680 --> 10:43.040]  theorist because he said hey put something over your monitor over your computer monitor that little
[10:43.040 --> 10:48.800]  camera that's on the monitor people can be watching you oh you're paranoid you're just paranoid you
[10:48.800 --> 10:53.280]  think everybody's watching you you're sitting here on the couch wearing a tenfold hat well
[10:53.280 --> 11:00.400]  now it's mainstream accepted news listen to us news and world report tape your webcam they say
[11:00.400 --> 11:06.800]  a few years late but they are finally coming around horrifying malware can broadcast you
[11:06.800 --> 11:12.400]  to the world they say the internet is flush with webcam videos of people who clicked unwittingly
[11:12.400 --> 11:20.080]  on a malware link and then open their computer to anonymous miscreants intent on mocking blackmailing
[11:20.080 --> 11:27.680]  or simply spying on them anonymous miscreants who would blackmail or simply spy on you we
[11:27.680 --> 11:35.440]  call those people in many cases the nsa or the fbi i guess we have now have a new acronym they say
[11:35.440 --> 11:41.840]  these are remote access trojans rats maybe we should just kind of include all these surveillance
[11:41.840 --> 11:48.880]  agencies into an acronym remote access trojans and just call them all rats we don't have to
[11:48.880 --> 11:54.320]  go through the alphabet soup of nsa cia fbi we can just call them all rats i think that's a great
[11:54.320 --> 12:00.560]  way to uh to approach this from here on out they're trojans of course and the question is
[12:01.600 --> 12:07.280]  are our federal rats are remote access trojans are they prophylactics or are they trojan horses
[12:08.800 --> 12:15.680]  that's the real question now the venezuelans are being thrown in jail for tweets if they criticize
[12:15.680 --> 12:20.000]  the government because that's the next place where it's going we've already seen wesley clark
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.080]  saying if you're disloyal to the government and we're going to determine that by watching you
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.560]  on social media are you depressed because you lost your girlfriend you don't have a job you got family
[12:28.560 --> 12:33.360]  problems whatever we're going to watch you we're going to do something about it before you get
[12:33.360 --> 12:40.960]  radical before you get violent in other words before you commit a crime pre-crime because you
[12:40.960 --> 12:45.440]  know we can we're picking up people not charging them with crimes or taking their property not
[12:45.440 --> 12:50.960]  charging them with crimes not convicting anybody so now let's just take people before there's
[12:50.960 --> 12:58.160]  there's anything being done and of course we have mike mccall offering a bill that will be funded
[12:58.160 --> 13:05.040]  through fema another department of homeland security that would fund this pre-crime cyber
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.400]  violence that they say is coming violent extremism this new department to combat violent extremism
[13:12.400 --> 13:18.240]  here's what venezuela does because we're headed down the same road venezuelans are being thrown
[13:18.240 --> 13:24.240]  in jail for tweeting and criticizing the government on twitter eight people have been jailed in the
[13:24.240 --> 13:28.320]  last 11 months for tweeting messages that the government found offensive or thought were a
[13:28.320 --> 13:33.360]  threat to the country's political instability who created that political instability there was
[13:33.360 --> 13:38.880]  yugo chavez and the current guy that's there that sold the people out to the bankers just like the
[13:38.880 --> 13:45.360]  socialist in greece cyprus the prime minister there bloomberg was bragging about how they got
[13:45.360 --> 13:51.440]  700 return on investment out of venezuela they say these guys understand that they pay the bond
[13:51.440 --> 13:56.480]  holders first and in that article they were talking about how the citizens had to go to
[13:56.480 --> 14:01.840]  other countries to get food water medicine but they were going to get their investments covered
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.080]  and they were making a killing as they kill the people there now listen to what they are doing
[14:06.080 --> 14:11.920]  here these are charges that range from conspiracy oh that's that's pretty broad isn't it instigating
[14:11.920 --> 14:17.600]  hatred to espionage and quote unquote causing anxiety just causing anxiety you know like
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.880]  wesley clark says you got a right to be disloyal to the united states but we got a right to segregate
[14:22.880 --> 14:28.160]  you for the duration of the conflict in other words a war on terror that is never going to end
[14:28.800 --> 14:33.440]  all these people all these charges rather qualify for probation defense lawyers say but
[14:33.440 --> 14:39.760]  somehow somehow their cases have stalled and five of the eight people are still behind bars
[14:39.760 --> 14:47.200]  they say where they're being held is a caracas prison that is guarded by intelligence personnel
[14:47.200 --> 14:53.120]  of the s e b i n the bolero bolero bolivarian service of national intelligence you know what
[14:53.120 --> 14:59.280]  they call that building that they're keeping in the headquarters of the s e b i n they call it the tomb
[15:00.560 --> 15:07.520]  that organization has been around since they had right wing military coups they have right wing
[15:07.520 --> 15:13.360]  military coups they create this secret police organization their headquarters is called the
[15:13.360 --> 15:22.240]  tomb and then they change to leftist still stays the same nothing changes of course a lot of those
[15:22.240 --> 15:29.760]  coups were created by our own cia just like the coup that preceded all the problems that we have
[15:29.760 --> 15:35.440]  between america and iran the coup of iran that established the secret police the savak in iran
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.360]  of course we never hear about that as far as americans are concerned the first time they ever
[15:39.360 --> 15:46.320]  heard of iran was when the american embassy was taken over but we have a long history of our
[15:46.320 --> 15:52.000]  government of the cia overthrowing governments and putting in military dictatorships but more
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.800]  importantly putting in a secret police a tyranny so why would we think that they would ever do
[15:58.800 --> 16:02.880]  that here in america why would we think they would ever be an overthrow of our government why
[16:02.880 --> 16:07.520]  would we ever think that they would do things that they would act on things like the ndaa
[16:08.880 --> 16:13.520]  you know yesterday we were talking about and just briefly covered the headlines about how
[16:13.520 --> 16:18.320]  there's a new encroachment on us letting the government take our passports without trial
[16:19.040 --> 16:25.920]  this is something that probably obama will sign this is something that is being pushed by republicans
[16:25.920 --> 16:32.080]  this is a radical attack this is an article we had yesterday and info wars dot com from
[16:32.080 --> 16:38.480]  new american a radical attack on the due process of americans it's received virtually no media
[16:38.480 --> 16:43.520]  attention that's why i want to talk about it again today without trial without criminal charges
[16:43.520 --> 16:49.360]  wherever you heard that before civil asset four for sure for one the ndaa for another the war on
[16:49.360 --> 16:54.880]  drugs the war on terror they're all connected it's all about an authoritarian government
[16:54.880 --> 16:59.760]  and the secret police who are going to run it now of course they give it a nice name they say this
[16:59.760 --> 17:07.280]  is the fto the foreign terrorist organization passport revocation act oh it's only for foreigners
[17:07.280 --> 17:13.840]  it's only for terrorists remember faiza was the foreign intelligence surveillance act
[17:14.560 --> 17:19.680]  now that's being used as a rubber stamp for domestic intelligence surveillance so forget
[17:19.680 --> 17:23.280]  about the foreign forget about the terrorists because we know that they're more interested
[17:23.280 --> 17:28.080]  in homegrown domestic terrorists that's what mike mccall's bill is about that's what westley clark's
[17:28.800 --> 17:34.240]  floating these balloons is about they say it didn't even receive a recorded vote supposedly
[17:34.240 --> 17:40.080]  because it was uncontroversial it passed after 15 minutes of alleged debate hey that's almost as
[17:40.080 --> 17:47.040]  much as they're going to give to the sovereignty destroying copyright extending privacy destroying
[17:47.040 --> 17:52.560]  internet destroying sovereignty destroying transatlantic trans pacific partnership agreements
[17:52.560 --> 17:56.880]  they're going to get 20 minutes a little bit more than this so they had 15 minutes of debate
[17:57.440 --> 18:03.200]  the sponsor ted po a republican from texas said the measure was adopted under a suspension of
[18:03.200 --> 18:09.200]  the rules that's typically used for trivialities like renaming post offices or passing massive
[18:09.200 --> 18:14.320]  trade treaties negotiated in secret now i added that last bit secretary of state may refuse to
[18:14.320 --> 18:19.200]  issue a passport any individual whom the secretary has determined has aided assisted abetted or
[18:19.200 --> 18:24.160]  otherwise help an organization that the secretary has determined designated as a foreign terrorist
[18:24.160 --> 18:30.080]  organization so that means people like hillary clinton people like john carrey will be able to
[18:30.080 --> 18:37.280]  strip you of your passport will be able to confine you in the country without any due process without
[18:37.280 --> 18:43.120]  charging you of any crime and of course we've already got something very similar to that

[24:15.200 --> 24:22.000]  thursday july 30th 2015 as i mentioned before alex jones is in europe he's been in europe this week
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.280]  and he has a report from us that we're going to be playing in the next segment spain has fallen to
[24:27.280 --> 24:32.000]  eu tyranny and of course this is something that affects us all it's not just something that's
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.320]  happening in europe this is part of a global plan and right now they're trying to join us
[24:38.320 --> 24:44.320]  economically to europe that's part of taking our sovereignty creating an economic union
[24:44.320 --> 24:50.000]  then creating crisis then saying sovereignty has to be surrendered to the center we are already
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.840]  seeing that in europe we've seen ellen greenspan we've seen massive bond companies others saying
[24:55.840 --> 25:00.400]  the only way we're going to solve these problems like we have in greece is for the countries to
[25:00.400 --> 25:04.400]  surrender their sovereignty and of course if you don't surrender your sovereignty they take it anyway
[25:04.400 --> 25:09.120]  that's what they did in greece as well as seizing their hard assets so alex is going to be joining
[25:09.120 --> 25:16.320]  us with that report in the next segment that we have we also have joe biggs and senate covering
[25:16.320 --> 25:23.840]  the murder of a driver during a traffic stop this is a campus cop who pulls a guy over and just shoots
[25:23.840 --> 25:28.480]  him in the head an amazing video we're going to play that video for you we're also going to be talking
[25:28.480 --> 25:35.920]  to joe biggs and senate and to paul joseph watson later in the show from the uk now before we get
[25:35.920 --> 25:39.680]  back to the news i just want to let you know this hour the alex jones show is brought to you by the

[26:30.160 --> 26:35.360]  because there's a little bit more that i wanted to say about these new devices and i thought it was
[26:35.360 --> 26:40.320]  interesting that in the particular story that they had here from the associated press the mother
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.360]  was the one who was buying this but it was a daughter who was creeped out by having some device
[26:45.360 --> 26:49.120]  that was listening to everything that she was having to say and again as i point out they're
[26:49.120 --> 26:53.360]  going to have barbie dolls and i think they ought to put them in a nazi uniform a class barbie doll
[26:53.360 --> 26:59.920]  maybe put it on its own comes in its own personal interment camp uh that you can imagine that you're
[26:59.920 --> 27:05.680]  in but this is all about the internet of things you know things like the doll chucky from the horror
[27:05.680 --> 27:11.600]  movies the electronic privacy information center a watchdog group wants the ftc to set security
[27:11.600 --> 27:16.960]  standards and strict limitation on the storage and use of personal information collected through
[27:16.960 --> 27:23.120]  internet connected microphones and cameras well that's great that's a good idea but it's not going
[27:23.120 --> 27:29.760]  to be stopped by legislation it'll be stopped when parents get discernment we have to understand
[27:29.760 --> 27:35.280]  where this is all going on now of course amazon is saying that this device the echo people don't
[27:35.280 --> 27:41.360]  need to worry about these devices eavesdropping on them as a safeguard it is programmed to only come
[27:41.360 --> 27:48.000]  on after it's activated with the press of a button or a certain keyword yeah you know like the webcam
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.240]  on your computer that now everybody is being warned about is easily hacked with trojan horses
[27:54.240 --> 27:59.200]  and they can watch everything that you do put it up on the web whatever good luck with that
[27:59.920 --> 28:03.680]  good luck with all of these things you have to understand any kind of electronic device you
[28:03.680 --> 28:10.400]  have can be hacked and used misused by other individuals whether they're private individuals
[28:10.400 --> 28:15.600]  or whether they're the government looking to blackmail you to spy on you or just to put collect
[28:15.600 --> 28:19.840]  all your data and put you in a massive database so they can run an artificial intelligence program
[28:19.840 --> 28:24.400]  through there and see if they think that you might possibly according to that program be a threat to
[28:24.400 --> 28:30.240]  them then they can pick you up and do something about it one of the aspects of this information
[28:30.240 --> 28:35.600]  sharing that's very important because understand that a big part of the way they get this information
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.960]  is getting it free from companies like amazon or apple you know when you talk to siri they record
[28:40.960 --> 28:46.240]  this stuff all of these companies your phone company whatever they take the legal position the
[28:46.240 --> 28:50.880]  government does they take the legal position that this information belongs to the corporation
[28:51.520 --> 28:58.080]  to the phone company to the computer company to the toy company and because they own information
[28:58.080 --> 29:04.240]  about you they can turn it over to the government and they don't need a search warrant that's one
[29:04.240 --> 29:10.480]  of the biggest loopholes in this surveillance state and they want to increase that they want to remove
[29:11.360 --> 29:17.760]  any liability from the corporations to make them reluctant of course they have many ways that they
[29:17.760 --> 29:21.840]  can pressure the phone company with licenses but they want to remove that liability for them so
[29:21.840 --> 29:28.320]  they've brought to us several times syspa cis pa the p stands for protection they're protecting
[29:28.320 --> 29:33.440]  the corporations now they're offering it again but without the p there so you don't ask it's just
[29:33.440 --> 29:39.360]  cyber intelligence sharing act we all need to fight this there's an organization that's fighting it
[29:39.360 --> 29:45.200]  called fight for the future they're sending faxes to them the ultimate obnoxious spam is sending
[29:45.200 --> 29:53.600]  a fax they said this is 1984 technology let's send it to you in 1980 faxes run alex jones and the gcn
[29:53.600 --> 30:02.480]  radio network undercover journalists from the center for medical progress have revealed that they
[30:02.480 --> 30:07.920]  have nine more planned parenthood videos in the can the groups founder david eliden said that they
[30:07.920 --> 30:13.680]  have close to 300 hours total of undercover video it was gathered during a 30 month long in-depth

[30:23.680 --> 30:28.800]  compliance with local recording laws but these facts have not prevented the los angeles superior
[30:28.800 --> 30:34.320]  court from issuing a temporary restraining order against cmp barring them from releasing any more
[30:34.320 --> 30:38.720]  footage of officials working with stem express planned parenthood is getting increasingly
[30:38.720 --> 30:43.440]  desperate to distract from the issue of how they sell the body parts of the babies that they abort

[33:26.800 --> 33:31.680]  alex jones here reporting live from barcelona spain we're also going to be reporting from madrid
[33:31.680 --> 33:40.400]  and other cities we're investigating the press reports that basically all of europe is falling
[33:40.400 --> 33:45.920]  into classical tyranny with capital controls restrictions on the press persecution of even
[33:45.920 --> 33:52.000]  mild political speech stuff that used to be a huge deal when other countries did it so what's
[33:52.000 --> 33:59.840]  happening to the west info wars.com is investigating now i'd be very careful about what i say while
[33:59.840 --> 34:10.240]  i'm inside this country we have not just discovered the fascism the tyranny in the newspapers in zero
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.360]  heads the united states one independent in the uk basically breaking down the fact that 1984 has
[34:15.360 --> 34:21.360]  come to spain we have already experienced it and can't even talk about it till we get out of the
[34:21.360 --> 34:27.680]  country and i'm not going to be at this point giving folks the tales about when we'll specifically
[34:27.680 --> 34:33.920]  be leaving and going to the next EU country falling under totalitarianism in their words
[34:35.040 --> 34:41.200]  that said the headlines are everywhere that people are being fined for criticizing police
[34:41.200 --> 34:49.280]  response times no free speech they announced just a month ago 10 things you can't do one of them
[34:49.280 --> 34:55.040]  is criticize the king in any way now this is supposedly a western country we hear criticisms
[34:56.160 --> 35:05.760]  of organizations and groups in china or in cuba and we were all brought up that was just
[35:05.760 --> 35:10.880]  absolutely horrible and terrible but now not just here but in the uk as well they're now
[35:10.880 --> 35:17.920]  nabbing people off the streets that try to go to draw muhammad cartoon events so free speech is
[35:17.920 --> 35:21.280]  being eliminated it's being expanded across the board the united states is trying to bring this in
[35:21.280 --> 35:27.200]  as well so i want to be clear we're not picking on spain this is a beautiful country i've studied
[35:27.200 --> 35:32.800]  its history a lot it's amazing it has an ancestral memory of being invaded by the moors out of north
[35:32.800 --> 35:40.640]  africa and then having to be reconquered by groups on northern spain and europe and they have been
[35:40.640 --> 35:46.800]  basically threw a lot in the last thousand plus years so it's ingrained in the culture to get in
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.920]  line with the talitarianism uh but before i get into the latest developments it's important to note
[35:51.920 --> 36:01.040]  that uh franco francisco franco uh who in the early 30s basically staged a coup to take over spain
[36:01.680 --> 36:09.600]  then groomed won carlos who wasn't even in line to the throne to be his replacement upon his death
[36:09.600 --> 36:15.840]  in 1975 anybody can look this up it was only spain that didn't get in trouble at the end of world
[36:15.840 --> 36:20.080]  war two italy of course got in deep trouble my grandfather was part of the invasion of that
[36:20.080 --> 36:27.520]  country germany lost 20 plus million people uh for the activities of the nazi party uh spain
[36:27.520 --> 36:34.320]  that was the first fascist nation to basically join germany even before el duche uh musolini
[36:34.320 --> 36:39.760]  never got in trouble for it now i want to be clear the communists kill more people in russia
[36:39.760 --> 36:45.200]  and in china than the fascists did so it's a it's it's not a question of lesser of two evils i
[36:45.200 --> 36:51.440]  understand why a lot of spanish people didn't want to go under the tyranny uh of the soviets and they
[36:51.440 --> 36:57.360]  engaged in incredible atrocities and quite frankly made the fascists look like good guys so so i'm not
[36:57.360 --> 37:03.680]  comparing franco to hitler because i've studied it he wasn't uh but he did call himself the talitarian
[37:04.400 --> 37:09.840]  and then they put one carlos center in 75 they supposedly had these faux reforms they're now
[37:09.840 --> 37:16.480]  getting rid of those and we have experienced it here um not any security at the airport other
[37:16.480 --> 37:20.640]  than guys walking up with machine guns and staring at us in the face and doing it to everybody else
[37:20.640 --> 37:24.560]  families you name it and then saying welcome to the country letting us ride in then we went to
[37:24.560 --> 37:30.480]  just get a couple hundred euros exchange to pay for taxis it's a lot of taxes only take cash and
[37:32.720 --> 37:36.400]  it was just you know incredible well where's your hotel we'll give us this we'll give us that they're
[37:36.400 --> 37:42.560]  putting in an interpol database uh let us see your passport uh where are you going how long are you
[37:42.560 --> 37:47.440]  staying and they were putting it in an interpol database right in front of us see capital controls
[37:47.440 --> 37:53.120]  are coming here they're coming to grace you have 40% unemployment in this country with the collapse
[37:53.120 --> 37:59.200]  of society we're going to see a move towards the talitarianism that is going to stifle the
[37:59.200 --> 38:04.480]  incredibly rich culture of spain and other countries the problem is the globalists have
[38:04.480 --> 38:10.560]  sold socialism and communism as the answer to fascism when it's something that's even a more
[38:10.560 --> 38:16.800]  virulent variation historically uh than even fascism uh but it's like you're picking strict
[38:16.800 --> 38:21.280]  nine or cyanide they'll both kill your daughter in the hammer so this is a rich people a rich
[38:21.280 --> 38:27.360]  culture really nice folks very very polite a lot of amazing uh you know obviously art is everywhere
[38:27.360 --> 38:32.000]  the architecture anywhere you look is simply amazing whether it's medieval uh or whether it's
[38:32.000 --> 38:40.560]  more modern it's just that one thing is we're here uh down at uh one of the famous cathedrals
[38:40.560 --> 38:47.360]  just videotaping it and cops run over and get in our face and erase what's on our cameras uh and
[38:48.720 --> 38:53.120]  apologize for it but they were bugging their eyes out at us and they said oh we have to do this
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.840]  because of islamic extremism and understand this country got invaded and taken over by that
[38:57.840 --> 39:02.480]  that why is their government bringing in at record levels and then using it against people like us
[39:02.480 --> 39:07.680]  that came here with an open mind to try to basically investigate what's happening what's
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.320]  unfolding um again there'll be a lot more that we're going to be reporting on in the next few days
[39:12.320 --> 39:19.040]  here uh but this is not a free country and the veneer of freedom uh is basically evaporating
[39:19.040 --> 39:25.120]  it's basically uh being disappeared for the people that live uh in this once christian nation
[39:25.120 --> 39:29.920]  and as the christian culture dies which it's now doing i mean just 20 years ago upwards of 90 percent
[39:29.920 --> 39:33.920]  of people went to church in spain people say oh i'm sick of church well the point is it was some
[39:33.920 --> 39:40.800]  culture now something like 10 percent go same thing with england and into that vacuum of
[39:40.800 --> 39:45.120]  globalist tyranny and the big banks looting people and the crony capitalism not letting the economy
[39:45.120 --> 39:51.120]  flourish socialism is coming in and communism is coming in and so they're putting a police state in
[39:51.120 --> 39:58.400]  place to counter that so it's basically a choice of fascism or communism and i just don't want
[39:58.400 --> 40:04.080]  either choice but i'm not going to sit here and say that right wing fascism uh is worse than
[40:04.720 --> 40:08.560]  communism because historically it's just communism is the worst thing there is but but
[40:08.560 --> 40:13.760]  that's the false choice you're given we need to transcend that and have a culture of art have
[40:13.760 --> 40:18.240]  a culture of true liberty around the bill of rights and constitution itself that comes out
[40:18.240 --> 40:24.000]  of magna carta itself that comes out and helped create the renaissance that that spain's been a
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.360]  big part of when it comes to art and literature and everything else so i come to you from the
[40:30.240 --> 40:35.120]  country of for whom the bell tolls of course the ernaz himingway novel about the spanish
[40:35.120 --> 40:39.440]  civil war he was here during the spanish civil war we wrote a fiction novel about it george
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.240]  arwell wrote a nonfiction book about his experiences here and was wounded fighting the fascist and i
[40:44.240 --> 40:49.680]  totally get why he was fighting the fascist but he even wrote in his essays uh you can buy him
[40:49.680 --> 40:54.400]  in big compendium books that turned out the communist were just as bad or worse and that's
[40:54.400 --> 41:00.320]  what 1984 is about is if stalin would have taken over england and europe what the world would be
[41:00.320 --> 41:06.880]  like and now we've just got the globalist in charge who were just a high-tech version in the
[41:06.880 --> 41:12.960]  words of alice huxley uh of a brave new world model so again we're we're not trying to give you
[41:12.960 --> 41:18.080]  buzzwords here we're not trying to demonize anybody here it's going to be the spanish police
[41:18.720 --> 41:23.040]  whose children end up losing their future as well and they're allowing fascism to come in it's
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.920]  going to be set up it's going to fall to corporate communism with the corporations are offshore
[41:27.920 --> 41:33.120]  they're above the law they're exempt diplomatic community and there's communism on the ground
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.240]  in fact i predict if the new order has its way and the e u super states able to implode what's left
[41:38.240 --> 41:45.200]  of national sovereignty to bring in this tyranny i predict uh that that these nations will all fall
[41:45.200 --> 41:51.600]  to a form of what i'm coining techno or technotronic or technocratic communism and that's what we're
[41:51.600 --> 41:55.920]  facing because again it's communism on the ground first socialism into communism on the ground to
[41:55.920 --> 42:01.280]  domesticate to have controlled economies with those controlled economies serviced by above the law
[42:01.280 --> 42:07.200]  mega corporations less than 10 of them there's about 100 right now six media companies five banks
[42:07.200 --> 42:13.520]  but it's all consolidating right now and all the ideologies fascism communism all the fake
[42:13.520 --> 42:18.720]  choices were given will mean nothing when this comes in but but remember i'm in the only country
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.960]  that didn't fall at the end of world war two that was fascist and they had a soft uh
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.960]  you know fascism after that but it's back and i can tell you i've been in third world countries
[42:30.960 --> 42:36.400]  i've been in central america i've been at totalitarian regimes and in england they're also
[42:36.400 --> 42:41.920]  passing similar laws there has been a conscious decision made uh to do this so keep an eye on us
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.200]  here uh we hope to move to the next country and cover what's happening in italy and in greece
[42:47.200 --> 42:53.600]  other areas uh but they're moving to loot the spanish uh pension funds they're moving to loot
[42:53.600 --> 42:57.520]  people's private bank accounts now with bail ins this is coming to the united states and that's why
[42:57.520 --> 43:03.120]  i'm here was to investigate firsthand exactly what's happening uh but just a beautiful country
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.200]  always wanted to come here i've read so many history books about it uh and i gotta tell you
[43:07.200 --> 43:13.120]  it's even more amazing than uh a lot of the stuff i saw in the central areas of london
[43:13.120 --> 43:17.280]  been there many times we just picked a church courtyard here because it was a lot quieter
[43:17.280 --> 43:22.640]  from the city noise this is not even a snapshot of what's happening and unfolding i'm gonna throw
[43:22.640 --> 43:27.040]  this back to a live transmission with david night i'll be trying to call in or skype in later in
[43:27.040 --> 43:33.280]  the broadcast as well uh but um this is the most concerned i've ever been because let me explain
[43:33.280 --> 43:38.080]  something most countries like england and others that are becoming fascist they care about the
[43:38.080 --> 43:42.320]  press lauren canada held me for 15 hours for no reason you can tell and you see the news they
[43:42.320 --> 43:49.760]  don't care folks they don't care um but the police told me we don't care um and we'll be getting more
[43:49.760 --> 43:57.040]  into what's been going on since then but uh this is a very very serious situation and uh it is very
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.920]  very sad for this country all right alex jones signing off for info wars dot com more tape reports
[44:01.920 --> 44:06.320]  more live reports uh and more special reports coming if you're watching this transmission
[44:06.320 --> 44:12.000]  you are the hope of humanity you are the resistance and again that's alex jones reporting
[44:12.000 --> 44:18.560]  from spain and as he was pointing out they have enacted recently very strict laws not only against
[44:18.560 --> 44:23.920]  domestic reporters but about anybody who's doing any kind of reporting so he's very limited about
[44:23.920 --> 44:29.920]  what he can say he said the police are getting into his and getting into their face uh telling them
[44:29.920 --> 44:34.480]  what they can and cannot report i wasn't sure if he said that they took any uh footage from them
[44:34.480 --> 44:40.800]  probably did uh in fact and thinking about the long history of authoritarian government
[44:41.920 --> 44:46.720]  in uh in spain as he pointed out they were the only fascist government not to fall at the end of
[44:46.720 --> 44:52.240]  world war two i'm thinking of the monty python skit you know whether i can just vision uh rob
[44:52.240 --> 44:59.360]  dew and alex jones falling report like nobody expects a spanish inquisition right jumps in front
[44:59.360 --> 45:03.520]  of him our three main elements are i won't go into that whole thing i'll spare you from that but
[45:03.520 --> 45:08.240]  of course as we were pointing out before we've already seen then seen this happen in greece the
[45:08.240 --> 45:14.400]  greek prime minister syprus says that greece was forced to accept a recessionary bailout he's not
[45:14.400 --> 45:18.560]  even trying to tell people that it's good for them there's no way that you can put a positive spin
[45:18.560 --> 45:25.120]  on this thing why would he give the greek people a referendum and then turn right around and give
[45:25.120 --> 45:32.800]  them a far far far worse deal i mean 50 billion dollars in hard assets another 36 billion uh sorry
[45:32.800 --> 45:39.360]  not dollars but euros another 36 billion euros and extend and pretend loans and of course the
[45:39.360 --> 45:46.960]  previous week the economic minister varifakis would believe did not want to see cash controls
[45:46.960 --> 45:51.600]  put on and did not support that and thought that he had an agreement he mentioned that at the beginning
[45:51.600 --> 45:56.880]  of the uh day on sunday and then by that evening they had enacted cash controls he said we would
[45:56.880 --> 46:02.880]  never do cash controls it's anathema to us but by the end of the day they had him so there was
[46:02.880 --> 46:07.920]  this division even within that government so i don't know how much of that they were forced
[46:07.920 --> 46:13.760]  to accept i'm sure he would have liked to have done what the people in greece wanted but not so
[46:13.760 --> 46:18.800]  much that he would fight the globalist for it he had didn't have the will to do that now today there
[46:18.800 --> 46:26.720]  has been a fourth planned parenthood video that has aired this one is also very damning and we're
[46:26.720 --> 46:30.640]  going to talk about that in just a moment but of course the interesting thing is is that even though
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.360]  planned parenthood is telling us there's really nothing here this is just a hoax it's phony this
[46:35.360 --> 46:41.440]  is information that is not incriminating you've got them telling all the media outlets and media
[46:41.440 --> 46:46.320]  outlets are pretty much playing along with it as camille poggley was absolutely outraged a feminist
[46:46.320 --> 46:54.160]  she said she supports a woman's right to an abortion she has been a member of planned parenthood
[46:54.160 --> 46:59.200]  but she was outraged by what these videos showed from planned parenthood and outraged about how
[46:59.200 --> 47:06.160]  they had been censored in the media now we've got stem express one of the companies that's buying
[47:06.160 --> 47:13.520]  the baby parts went to court to put a gag order on these videos at least the ones that involve
[47:13.520 --> 47:18.880]  them an la superior court issued a temporary injunction tuesday to stop the center for medical
[47:18.880 --> 47:25.360]  progress from releasing any video showing three officials from stem express a company that transfers
[47:25.360 --> 47:31.680]  fetal tissue from abortions performed at planned parenthood and other clinics to medical researchers
[47:31.680 --> 47:35.520]  stem express said that they are grateful that its rights have been vindicated in a court of law
[47:36.160 --> 47:40.320]  but the center said in a statement that the court threw out most of the company's request they say
[47:40.320 --> 47:46.400]  stem express is attempting to use meritless litigation to cover up this illegal baby parts
[47:46.400 --> 47:52.320]  trade to suppress free speech to silence the citizen press reporting on issues of burning
[47:52.320 --> 47:58.400]  concern to the american public yeah they're called the center for medical progress maybe we won't
[47:58.400 --> 48:04.240]  only get medical progress but maybe we'll get some media progress out of this when people see how
[48:04.240 --> 48:11.120]  controlled the media is this is a huge story on so many different fronts because as this issue
[48:11.120 --> 48:18.640]  points out it's not just planned parenthood selling it it's the people who are buying the parts
[48:18.640 --> 48:23.680]  creating the market and doing the experiments for you know it wasn't just the soldiers in the
[48:23.680 --> 48:30.560]  nazi concentration camps who killed people or who perform these horrific procedures on their
[48:30.560 --> 48:36.000]  prisoners without their informed consent like we now have the laws they're taking where medical
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.200]  informed consent it wasn't just those people who actually did it but it was also the doctor doctor
[48:41.200 --> 48:46.800]  mingela who wanted it for research that he said was for the good of all mankind it's always for
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.440]  the good of all mankind it was for the good of all mankind when they did the tuskegee experiments
[48:52.080 --> 48:56.640]  and lied to people telling them that they were getting treatment for syphilis when they weren't
[48:58.320 --> 49:03.280]  that's what we always see as the answer for this now let's take a look at this fourth video
[49:03.280 --> 49:07.600]  that just came out we're not going to play a lot of the video here we don't have very much time for
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.560]  it but here are some of the things that were said in the video want to just give you a really quick
[49:12.560 --> 49:17.840]  rundown this is a video that was done of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains this is a
[49:18.480 --> 49:24.480]  facility in Colorado does over 10,000 abortions a year they have a contract to supply boarded fetal
[49:24.480 --> 49:31.360]  tissue i would say to provide a boarded baby body parts to Colorado State University in Fort Collins
[49:31.360 --> 49:37.120]  here's some of the things that they said sometimes if we get if if someone delivers before we get to
[49:37.120 --> 49:44.720]  see them for a procedure then we are intact in other words if somebody has the baby before they do
[49:44.720 --> 49:53.200]  the abortion then we have an intact baby think about that let that sink in if they have the
[49:53.200 --> 50:01.600]  baby before we see them for the procedure we are intact no the baby is intact so in other words
[50:01.600 --> 50:09.760]  they're saying that if somebody has a second trimester birth then they kill that child and
[50:09.760 --> 50:16.320]  sell the body parts that's what they're talking about let's translate that for you you can watch
[50:16.320 --> 50:21.760]  this you can thank for yourself you can see these video clips some more things that they said we'd
[50:21.760 --> 50:25.600]  have to do a little bit of training with the providers or something to make sure that they
[50:25.600 --> 50:32.960]  don't crush fetal organs during the second trimester abortions this is absolutely amazing I say
[50:32.960 --> 50:38.960]  putting it under research gives us a little bit of overhang over the whole thing if you have someone
[50:38.960 --> 50:43.840]  in a really anti-state who's going to be doing this for you you're probably going to get caught
[50:43.840 --> 50:48.400]  well we got it figured out with our lawyer Kevin Paul he's got to figure it out that even if because
[50:48.400 --> 50:52.240]  we talked to him in the beginning you know we don't want to get you called on say selling body
[50:52.240 --> 50:56.880]  parts across state lines which is what they're doing so they know how to spend this stay with us

[54:19.920 --> 54:26.400]  uh joe biggs is in Cincinnati looking into what is happening there after this campus cop
[54:26.960 --> 54:34.480]  was just shown on video shooting a motorist in the head he has been charged with murder
[54:34.480 --> 54:39.360]  but he has pled not guilty so joe biggs is going to be joining us to talk about that in the next
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.960]  hour we also have paul joseph watson coming up later in the program before we get back to the news

[56:15.760 --> 56:21.440]  from plan parenthood as we had to go to break i was just talking about how they were skirting
[56:21.440 --> 56:27.760]  the law they said if you're in a real anti-state anti-abortion state you're gonna have somebody
[56:27.760 --> 56:32.160]  doing this for you you're probably going to get caught but we have a lawyer they say kevin paul
[56:32.160 --> 56:37.840]  he's helping the affiliates skirt the fetal tissue law here's a quote from the video he's
[56:37.840 --> 56:42.000]  got it figured out that he knows that even if because we talked to him in the beginning you know
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.360]  we were like we don't want to get called on you know selling fetal parts across states
[56:48.080 --> 56:53.200]  and the buyer asks in the video and you feel confident that they're building those layers
[56:53.200 --> 57:00.640]  layers of legal protection layers of plausible deniability layers of gray area they say says
[57:00.640 --> 57:04.880]  oh yeah i'm confident our legal will make sure that we're not put in that situation
[57:04.880 --> 57:09.680]  they know that's what they're doing they know that's what they're doing but they're going to
[57:09.680 --> 57:16.160]  game the system in order to do that now they have nine more videos that are planned there's already
[57:16.160 --> 57:23.040]  been a restraining order put on them that would apply to any videos that would include stem express
[57:23.040 --> 57:29.520]  stem express again is part of this they are providing the market for these parts as well as
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.840]  the federal government providing the market for these baby parts as we've got an article on info
[57:35.840 --> 57:42.400]  wars dot com talking about the nine more videos coming out steve wasan has some tweets in there
[57:42.400 --> 57:47.040]  this is from fox news they say la judge issues orders preventing publication of anti abortion
[57:47.040 --> 57:52.800]  video troubling at best someone named truth agenda replies planned parenthood insists that it
[57:52.800 --> 57:58.480]  isn't worried yeah right somebody is very worried but of course a planned parenthood president says
[57:58.480 --> 58:04.560]  these extremist videos extremist videos that sounds like the kind of language that could get you
[58:04.560 --> 58:09.920]  locked away in one of westley clark or femas and permit camps these extremist videos are nothing
[58:09.920 --> 58:15.840]  short of an attack on women no they're actually an attack on women and men because that's what
[58:15.840 --> 58:22.400]  these babies would become they say they're being secretly filmed without consent yeah it's called
[58:22.400 --> 58:28.400]  a sting operation i have a picture here from abby johnson who is with us earlier in the week she
[58:28.400 --> 58:32.480]  testified in texas she says this is what looks like when planned parenthood is called to testify
[58:32.480 --> 58:37.040]  and it's a picture of an empty room that didn't even bother to show up stay with us we'll be right

[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host today joining us in the next
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:37.680]  segment will be joe bigs he is in cison adio hio covering the recent indictment of a campus cop
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.760]  there who pulled a motorist over and shot him in the head in a very short period of time we're
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:47.120]  going to play that video and we're going to talk to joe bigs in the next segment i was just talking
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:54.800]  about the furor that has happened over these planned parenthood videos a fury that is limited
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.160]  to one side of the political spectrum because planned parenthood has been very effective
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.680]  at censoring this in most places when we look at usa today when we look at roiders all these
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:12.240]  different outlets there is absolutely nothing about these planned parenthood videos yet we
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:18.640]  see all of these videos and presentations as i covered yesterday about cesil the lion there's
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:24.400]  all these we got a video of jimmy kimmel who is weeping about this of course you know we had
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.440]  john bainer weeping about his golf game earlier in the week but he can't be concerned about what's
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:35.680]  going on in these planned parenthood facilities camille poglia who is a feminist who supports
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.320]  abortion rights is very concerned about it and she's concerned about the censorship but of course
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.000]  not the mainstream media there was an article today however that touches on this story that
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.760]  we're going to be talking to joe bigs in the next segment about really kind of bridges the two of
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.800]  them as i mentioned yesterday you know when they look at cesil the lion i thought there were a lot
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:01.600]  of striking ironies and parallels between what happened to cesil the lion and what happens
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.840]  to people in these abortion clinics as abby johnson had pointed out the luring of women in
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:13.520]  under the pretense of family planning pushing them to have an abortion with a quota that she
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.760]  was given as a director of a planned parenthood facility and that's precisely what happened
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:25.520]  with the lion people are outraged that he created a great legal area by luring the lion out of the
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:31.360]  preservation area so he could kill him they were outraged that the lion died painfully over a long
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.960]  period of time but they're not outraged when children are ripped apart and that was one of the
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.240]  things that caused abby johnson to resign from planned parenthood when she saw the lie of planned
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:49.440]  parenthood that these babies don't feel any pain she saw the child recoiling on ultrasound as they
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:55.360]  were crushing that particular one with their forceps and of course they were outraged that
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.400]  cesil the lion's head was taken as a trophy but they're not outraged that they would sell
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:08.960]  baby parts to get a trophy car how about that are you outraged you ought to be but of course
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.640]  usa today doesn't put it out there Reuters doesn't put it out there but usa today has
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.440]  fury over cesil the lion also sparks race conversation okay i agree we ought to talk
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:25.360]  about that analogy too is it going to be open season on motorist open season on black people
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.800]  open season on anybody that the cops choose to kill do they have a license to kill is that what a
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.000]  police badge today means even for campus cops that you have a license to kill now he has been
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.840]  indicted he'll probably will be treated differently because he is a campus cop because he isn't an
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:47.200]  official police cop and that's a good analogy to talk about and we should have that discussion
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:54.240]  as well because that is also a big problem and people are far more concerned about cesil the
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:00.080]  lion than they are about this motorist that was killed so we're going to talk to joe bigs when
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:07.680]  we come back just briefly some updates on hillary clinton yesterday we saw on the drudge report
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:13.120]  all of these articles about a new book coming out about secret service agents recollection talking
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:19.680]  about how the marriage between bill and hillary is a sham that it is simply there for appearances
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.520]  so she can run for president talking about how if they are put on the detail to protect hillary
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.000]  clinton that is considered to be a punishment detail you know kind of like if you're a german
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.920]  soldier getting sent to the russian front we've got news articles about ubs deal well the first
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:41.840]  thing she did when she became secretary of state was smooth things over for ubs and of course the
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:47.920]  banks are big supporters of her it's amazing that even the onion did a parody piece saying
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:54.080]  clinton had been given three weeks of suspension by the fbc for spitting on her staffers that's the
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.520]  arrogance that even people on the left see they would be right back with joe bigs the devil obsessed
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:05.120]  cult that brought you that huge bronze baphomet statue is now funding a huge effort to undermine
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:11.440]  anti-abortion legislation the satanic temple says that proceeds from ticket sales from the largest
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:18.240]  public satanic ceremony in history will be used to support the reproductive rights legal action fund
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:23.200]  the cult which clearly aligns itself with the devil even though they claim not to believe you
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.480]  really exist has a questionable statement on its website suggesting that the reason they support
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:36.080]  abortion is to do with personal choice and women's rights not an identification with historical satanic
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:42.640]  child sacrifice or you know doing the evil bidding of the dark lord then the satanic temple recently
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:47.200]  launched a federal lawsuit against the state of missouri claiming that the state's laws restricting
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:54.160]  abortion violate their free exercise of satanism and that abortion is an essential religious duty

[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:31.520]  is leon macadoo one of our reporters from players and planet tv that's where i hang out that's where
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:38.560]  leon hangs out joe biggs our reporter is in Cincinnati he is looking at this murder and it
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:44.880]  is a murder i believe it is of course he's been indicted for murder he's been indicted for a
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.440]  voluntary manslaughter as well as one count of murder it's kind of interesting that they would
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.520]  indict him for both of these things i don't really understand that leon but we're going to be talking
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:59.920]  to joe biggs and before we talk about the details of this let's play this video so that you can
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:05.040]  hear and we'll try to describe what is happening if you need any narration for this i'm not sure
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:12.080]  how good the audio is is on this but let's uh we're going to play this video this is a campus cop
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:19.520]  at the university of Cincinnati he pulls over a uh an individual samuel debose a black man he
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:25.120]  pulls him over for a traffic stop this is about a half mile from the university's campus i don't
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.920]  know uh i mean he's a campus cop is he even out of his jurisdiction i'm not sure but let's play this
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:49.440]  video so that's the body camp he's trying to figure out
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.880]  if he's got a license right he originally he was pulled over a stop for not having a license plate
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.760]  on the front of the vehicle the man is calmly explaining i have it right here it's in my glove
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:06.080]  compartment during the whole interaction he's calm he's not being belligerent you can see the full
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:12.000]  video we have it up at info wars just to kind of see how quickly they spoke for about two minutes
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.240]  and then it took him all of two seconds he was trying to open samuel debose's door yeah he wanted
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:23.840]  him to get out which he doesn't have to do that yeah yeah well exactly but i mean he's he's he says
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.240]  i don't have my license but i'm in the system right he said you can here's my name you can look
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.080]  me up and he says well why don't you have your license let me know you know is it suspended
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:38.640]  and he's like no it's not i just i don't have it on me and so then he starts to open his door
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.200]  and the man puts the key in the ignition and he starts to take off and and you hear the cop
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:49.280]  saying stop stop and i mean that fast he just shoots him right in the head and you know i knew
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.280]  when i uploaded this video last night that i was going to get the typical racist trolls on there
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:00.480]  but what i was not expecting to see were so many comments from the obsequious police state
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:05.200]  mentality of people saying he deserved it yeah he deserved to be shot in the head you have to be
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:10.400]  shot in the head right off the bat and we have reported over and over again about how america
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.760]  compares to all these other countries countries that will have over 20 30 years they might have
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:22.800]  one situation where the cops fired their gun in anger where one person was killed i forget what
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:29.440]  country it was i reported on the nightly news last week they had fired their fired one shot in
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.920]  several years and they didn't hit anybody okay it was a warning shot we used to have warning shots
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:40.080]  we used to have cops who were not always afraid for their life as they say that's the alibi that
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.280]  they use in every one of these situations look when we saw these mass all these shootings in
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:49.360]  new mexico and we we learned you know there was that video where they shot that homeless man in
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:54.320]  the hills and we learned that new mexico was shooting more people killing more people than
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.960]  new york city was even though new york city has many many times more people and as everybody
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:05.520]  started to focus on new mexico there was a police officer there who was a trainer in the state
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:13.120]  police academy who said we've been given a federal training curriculum that is a shoot
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.440]  first curriculum right and i refuse to teach it so they said fine you're fired
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.520]  that's the way this any good cops are being driven out and they're pushing this agenda from the
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.160]  federal government right and where does it end with how can you justify oh well he deserved it
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:35.360]  the cop had his arm in in his in the window grabbed onto his seatbelt hit he could have just let go
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.960]  you know what i mean he wasn't in danger there was no weapon that we could see or anything and he
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:44.240]  just it takes him one second to shoot this man in the head that's that i mean where did he get
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.520]  his weapons training yeah well what people need to understand is when you get a when you get training
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.640]  for a gun for a concealed carry whatever they explain what the law is to you as a citizen
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:59.760]  if somebody comes into your home and they're a robber that's coming into your home it's not a
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.600]  burglar you're there and they start stealing stuff from me you're not allowed to kill them
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.240]  if they're running away even if they got a very valuable item of yours and they're running away
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:15.760]  you're not allowed to kill them unless they're coming at you unless they are threatening your life
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:22.080]  and that applies to the police as well or it should in a just society the police unless their life
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:28.560]  is in danger they should not be taking lives this is over a traffic stop right just like
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:34.240]  eric gardener was killed because he was supposedly selling unbundled cigarettes to get them out to
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.880]  make a little bit of profit off of the confiscatory taxes that they enacted in new york city so they
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.200]  choked him to death right or we have the case of david eckard i believe that was also in new
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:49.200]  mexico he failed to stop completely at a stop sign so he got pulled over and a police officer
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.680]  thought he was clenching his butt cheeks so he was subjected to 14 hours of forced medical procedures
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.440]  this was last year they gave cavity searches x-rays colonoscopies and they even tried to make him
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.400]  pay for that forced medical procedures they subjected him to and it's all because the cop
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.480]  thought oh well you know you tightened up your butt cheeks so you deserved it and that's what
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.040]  it just makes me so angry is people saying oh well you deserve to get shot in the head
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:20.160]  because an officer didn't want you to get away he had never said you're under arrest he never
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:24.400]  charged him with anything there was nothing that he was saying okay you know what step out of the
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:30.160]  vehicle they can allege anything and they can get away with anything i mean look at this lady that
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:36.560]  died in houston picked up for a minor traffic violation they arrested her because they didn't
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:42.960]  like her attitude she's there for three days and then is is hung in her gel cell they say that it's
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:48.000]  suicide that doesn't seem plausible but when they say that she committed suicide because
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.880]  she consumed massive amounts of marijuana on day three in the jail i mean it gets more ridiculous
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.560]  we see what this is about we see through this it's very transparent what's going on here and
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.680]  although there's a lot of people who are enabling this behavior as you talked about trolls on social
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:11.360]  media there's a lot of people who are applauding that there are a lot of people who are getting
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.760]  really angry about this let's go to our reporter and uh Cincinnati Joe Biggs Joe
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:22.800]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com and actually at the Hamilton courthouse in downtown Cincinnati
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.680]  now we came out here to kind of find out what's going on with the Sam DeBose case we know that
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:33.360]  officer Ray Tenzing has had his bond said at a million dollars now now this is the officer who
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.360]  pulled over Sam DeBose in a traffic stop for not having a license plate on the front of his vehicle
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.400]  at that point in time he asked him if he even had a license on him they talked back and forth
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:49.440]  and it appeared that Sam DeBose even had his license on him so at this point in time officer
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:55.600]  Tenzing asked Mr. DeBose to take off a seat belt and and uh and exit the vehicle at that time
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.800]  Mr. DeBose then reached for the door and pulled it back shut now this is kind of where the story
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:06.480]  gets a little weird because the officer said that when the door shut that he got stuck to the car
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.840]  and the car took off and he was dragged which didn't happen yeah you can see that from the
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.560]  video camera frame by frame and see yeah he fell back well I mean and on top of that you have
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.240]  the other officer that was there as well that you see it towards the end of the video who was
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.400]  approaching the vehicle after the guy had been shot in the head you know and he cooperates the
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:29.440]  same story he says that the officer was dragged now if that were us civilians doing that we would
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:34.480]  get indicted on you know falsifying a report we'd be in trouble for something like that but this
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:40.560]  guy you know clear as day goes up to the vehicle they struggle for a second and then he shoots
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.440]  him in the head I mean that is right murder straight up and then you have then you have
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.560]  Megan Kelly from Fox News coming out saying that she doesn't quite believe that Ray Tenzing should
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.320]  be held on murder charges I think that's very interesting that she could even come to that
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.400]  conclusion well you know because sometimes you just need to have big brother and this is
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:04.880]  evidently one of those times is not evidently just when you've got big pharma profits involved as
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:11.600]  she said that initially about vaccines and about forcing people against their informed consent
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.440]  to take vaccines Megan Kelly said well sometimes you just just need big brother I guess you need
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.000]  big brother whenever there's a traffic stop and they need to be able to shoot you if you don't
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.360]  obey their orders if you give more attitude the interesting thing is though is Ray Tenzing defense
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:31.920]  team is going to try to push for self-defense self-defense from what yeah well that's the only
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.800]  way they could get him off because you know as well as I know Joe we're talking about that before
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:41.360]  you got on that you're not allowed to kill other people unless your life is in danger so they always
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:45.200]  try to make it sound as if their life is in danger but they're shooting people in the back
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.320]  they're creating situations where they don't have any threat to their lives look at Eric Gardner
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:54.400]  where he was choked to death there was no threat to the lives of those officers there
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:00.400]  but I've been looking at this way though imagine if that police officer or ex-police officer I
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:05.120]  should say didn't have his body cam on him then the narrative would have been the lies told in
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.720]  that police report and everyone would have believed that story thank god that camera was on and you
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:14.720]  actually know what happened yeah we wouldn't have known about that shooting in the hills outside of
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.680]  Albuquerque New Mexico if it hadn't been for body cams but subsequent situations into Mexico even
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:25.600]  though there was a major scandal in Albuquerque about corruption the police chief left he went to
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.520]  work for a company that sold body cams to the city at a very expensive rate and then these body cams
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.160]  for some reason were not turned on in many cases or they lost the data for that so that's the other
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.400]  way that they that they spend that but one of the things that you said and and we all do this Joe
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:46.400]  we all start using the language civilians can you imagine if it was a civilian and I think that
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:52.640]  betrays the whole militarized mindset that we're seeing of the police and and we're buying into
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.720]  that as well I remember the first time I heard that was in dirty hairy and I thought it was kind
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.560]  of a cynical joke that the cops would refer to people as civilians maybe they were doing it that
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:06.400]  far back but that definitely is the situation today because we have a militarized police and those
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:12.160]  rules of engagement are being driven by the feds pushing out this chute first curriculum yeah I
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:16.080]  mean like that's what I've been saying you know since day one when it comes to all these different uh
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:22.640]  you know horrible acts is the fact that this is coming this is all stemming from the training it's
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.480]  not the individual officers themselves you know sometimes that definitely plays a part but it's
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:30.320]  the training when you train someone properly when you train someone how to deal with these
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.480]  certain situations they don't react that way and when you get someone who's untrained you give them
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:39.280]  a badge you give them a gun they make stupid mistakes right absolutely we've got to go to
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:44.160]  break stay with us we're going to be right back with Joe Biggs and Cincinnati calling this covering
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.560]  this shooting and Cincinnati also joining me is Leanne McAdoo we'll be right back

[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:33.360]  at info wars life dot com leanna as we were talking about this shooting that happened in
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.080]  senson adi or earlier in the program i talked about how the usa today talked about the fury
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.680]  over cece the lion but saying there's no fury over these shootings that are part of police
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:49.040]  brutality and of course we've seen that the left usa today other mainstream media outlets
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:54.320]  don't cover the planned parenthood brutality right so we have this dichotomy on the left
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:59.760]  on the right where the the left excuses brutality of planned parenthood the right excuses the
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:05.360]  brutality of the police right and and that's the thing it's either all lives matter or they do not
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:11.280]  matter i mean it's the same people who are up in an uproar about the the planned parenthood videos
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.480]  are also sitting there saying that this guy deserved to get shot in the head or kelly
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:18.560]  thomas deserved to get beaten for in half an hour on camera but they're all concerned about
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.800]  cece the lion yes it may not be white legs matter black lives matter human lives don't
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:28.720]  matter but cece the lion's life matters more than any of this systemic problem joe biggs your comments
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.160]  well the interesting thing that's going on as the establishment wants these race wars
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.160]  they're pushing to see this happen in furguson it it worked the plan completely unfolded the
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:46.240]  way they wanted to you know the burning down of the city this the complete and total meltdown
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:52.320]  of that entire town the lack of leadership from furguson to help the youngsters through this and
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:58.880]  now you've seen a switch now you've seen the people kind of stand up and say screw the establishment
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.640]  we're not going to let you do this us because you saw it in cleveland when they stood up when
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.640]  there could have been possible riots the outcome of tamir riots the outcome of the officer jumping
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.600]  on top michael brillo jumping on the hood of the car and shooting 15 rounds and in the wind
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:17.440]  show killing two people you know the fact that you had the shooting in charleston where the people
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:21.840]  rose up and said you we're going to be better than this you're not going to destroy this we're not
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:27.120]  going to burn our city down and then now you have another city that starts with the sea everything
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:34.080]  happens in threes we're in simpson addy and this horrible act has happened this police officer
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.080]  murdered this man in cold blood straight up there's no other way you can look at this there's no
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.760]  other way to define what happened this guy is trying to claim that he did this in self defense
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:49.600]  which is another horrible disgusting lie this guy should be buried under the jail cell but
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:53.920]  you're going to see simpson addy rise up out of the ashes and they're going to
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:59.360]  to be a beacon of light for other cities and that's what we're seeing though in these cities
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.320]  the leadership that steps in when you have people who actually care about what's going on
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.120]  and the town comes together they beat it they overcome what the establishment wants and the
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.200]  race wars don't happen now they're still trying to push for it and you still got a lot of people
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.600]  out here with mixed emotions not really understanding what's going on young children who are just
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:22.160]  angry and they're using this as a way to let that anger out but you know i heard something
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:28.560]  interesting go ahead i heard something interesting earlier where there was a car driving by honking
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:34.560]  their horn and they're like yeah we got justice for sam de bose well guess what sam de bose was
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:40.320]  taken his justice was taken for life when he was murdered he doesn't get justice anymore that's right
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:45.840]  that's right and the man has only been indicted he hasn't been found guilty we don't know what his
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.400]  punishment if any would be because that's the other aspect of it i mean it was totally outrageous
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.240]  when they would refuse to even indict people but it's also outrageous when we see that they get
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:58.240]  slapped on the wrist well i mean the president though that they sent for setting a million
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:02.640]  dollar bond then they only really have to pay 10 percent of that they can go start to go fund me
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.880]  if they really wanted to and get this guy out of jail a murderer who killed this guy
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.200]  that kind of sets a precedence well we can obviously see how important these body cameras are i mean
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:18.480]  but it obviously didn't stop him from lying in the initial police reports it didn't stop him from
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.360]  carrying on with the story but at least we were able to you know get an indictment at this point
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:28.480]  in 10 days yeah absolutely well of course we we saw the report from the home secretary in the uk
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:33.440]  saying she wasn't going to use water cannons other militarized equipment on the streets of england
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:38.400]  because we had to get they had to get back to this idea of consensual policing we have to get back
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:43.600]  to that and if they don't deliver penalties that are commensurate to that we have to take action about
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:50.080]  that through democracy now joining us right after the break will be alex jones from europe the empires

[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:10.720]  live from marcelona spain now look at the headline satanic cult used profits from batha med statute
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:19.840]  unveiling to fight anti-abortion efforts why wouldn't they support child sacrifice the new
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:25.120]  orc based devil obsessed cult known as the satanic temple used funds for recent pr driven
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:30.240]  batha med statute unveiling in detroit found an effort to undermine legal moves of ban abortion
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:37.920]  that for 20 weeks as well as other anti-abortion legislation that story with video of the group
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:43.840]  whether they're black or white or hispanic they'll have green skin all so white the skin's green
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:50.880]  and anytime we go out and demonstrate and try to save babies out of nowhere just appears these these
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:56.160]  ghouls and you look at that chicken necks they're incredibly weak they stumble over potholes they
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:03.200]  can hardly walk but everyone just bows down to them instead of war hammering them i mean they
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.320]  want to sit there and feed on innocence let's let them have a real fight politically they need to be
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.840]  war hammered i mean we don't serve a weak god ladies and gentlemen we serve the powerful god
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.000]  that created the universe and the devils taken over the churches and all these other systems
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.400]  and that's why we are in the situation we are bowing down to these piles of
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:29.600]  them simpering stinking dead flesh that are self-propelled walking around animated by their
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.280]  weak fallen god these people make me sick and i didn't mean to get up here and start preaching i
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:44.080]  apologize it's just the the the falling down and worshiping the green skin maggot vomit that is
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:48.560]  satanist makes me want to throw up i mean put me in a ring with them i'll take five of them on it
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:55.200]  once give them battle axes give me one i guarantee you i guarantee you i will send them all straight
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:00.480]  to hell these people are weak and i'm tired of them ruling over us i'm tired of them if you want
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:07.920]  to throw up but the good news is the good news is humanity is rising and the globalists know it
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:13.200]  and that's why they're working as hard as they can to try to shutter our minds shutter our souls
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:19.040]  and put us in their false reality so they can control us because these evil people are afraid of
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.920]  those of us that are awake and tied into god and tied into the universe i'm gonna stop the preaching
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:32.320]  right there i'm gonna stop for a moment but i tell you i knew in my gut about three weeks ago i
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.800]  started saying hey i think i might go to europe think i might go to europe watching the meltdown
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:43.520]  watching the collapse of the economies in greece and ireland and spain and portugal and france
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:50.640]  and the uk watching all this happen i said i just feel like in my gut i need to get to europe
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.720]  and see what's happening and i did bone research talked a lot of experts and i said
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:59.440]  next up is spain next up is idly so we're going to spain we're here we're going to idly
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:04.080]  we're going to grace we've already been to the uk that has the main banking command base in the
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.440]  city of london within london running and all above the law of diplomatic community the british
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:13.440]  people aren't running it want to be clear they always misrepresent the globalists are based there
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:17.840]  to a great extent they're based in dc they're based in israel they're based in the vatican
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:23.200]  nothing against catholics nothing against jews the globalists are are separated out in different
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:29.680]  above the law diplomatically immune command bases and who else is diplomatically immune
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:36.960]  and in command bases royalty and i knew all this history but once i got here to spain a couple
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:44.480]  days ago i began to do research just to double check my memory and i was like my gosh this is
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:54.240]  crazy wand carlos was way down the line in royal succession the the spanish people had already
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:38:00.320]  voted pre-fascism pre-communism to get rid of their monarchy not to arrest them not to kill them
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:05.760]  like the communists into the zars in in russia but to just say you know what you don't own 300
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:11.040]  palaces you don't own the oil companies and the shipping firms and the people were not feudal serfs
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:18.560]  anymore were free because it was feudalism in spain the people were owned by the royalty they
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:23.840]  weren't owned by the royalty pretty much before the larica and quista but when the royals came in
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:32.640]  back by european nobility germanic and others to kick the islamic takeover the moors out one
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.920]  tyranny for another they became true feudalists i mean the people were the property after the
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.640]  larica and quista and and let's be honest they were historically treated better than under islamic
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:47.600]  rule uh that particular north african islamic rule was uh one of the most brutal there is out
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.800]  there slave trade everything which why the spanish picked up the slave trade after larica and quista
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.560]  was because they were taught it by the north africans again i'm just saying the political
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:02.400]  correctness i'm not islamophobic but the modern slave trade the atlantic slave trade was taught
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:09.360]  to spain and portugal by the moors who they didn't care what color you were if they could grab you
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.640]  they didn't slave you if you're a woman they didn't care what color you were they didn't slave you
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:19.360]  to buy slavery so i'm here in this incredibly historic place that that that gives us echoes
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.320]  of what's happened in other periods in history and how what they went through in the last thousand
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:30.240]  years plus here in spain and finally spain being freed by the wise one or else said and others
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:37.760]  it's just epic to see what's now happening once again here in spain the people you hear on the
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:43.360]  news you hear the greeks are lazy it's all their debt they're lazy they only work six days a week
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:47.440]  they should work seven days a week you know they should pay hundred percent taxes they're a bunch
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.960]  of lazy scum and then you look at the statistics of the greek people they work very hard on average
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:58.320]  some of their public sector and private sector pensions are a little unsustainable and based on
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:04.320]  derivatives but that's not the general public so you hear they all owe these debts they deserve it
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.720]  well i've been here in barcelona and i've been in some of the other cities we're going to be
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:15.200]  traveling with some others and the people are the most hop to it on top of it hardworking super
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:20.640]  service oriented that i've ever seen i mean boy this is lazy people we need some of this in the
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.680]  united states um and i talk to some of the locals a lot of info wars fans we've run into some of
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:31.360]  those videos are going to get uploaded these folks are working six days a week 10 hours a day uh
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:36.400]  they've had their taxes raised and raised and raised and raised they their their government has
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:42.000]  submitted to the eu takeover and all the vat taxes and the rest of it it's all selectively enforced
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.360]  and they've got catalonian separatist movement uh here where i'm at barcelona and catalonia just
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:54.720]  over the mountains to the north is france and they want to be their own country they're a mix of
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:01.200]  french germanic slash spanish and it's an older culture than most of spain the culture is more
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.920]  than 2000 years old and they're pretty much the original spanish culture that got overrun and
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:10.880]  taken over and they're just like you know what we're productive we work hard we're smart we
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:16.960]  don't want to be under one carlos and the eu we want to be free and you see catalonian flags on
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:21.840]  almost every house and almost every apartment hanging over the side and of course it didn't
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:27.360]  matter how they voted or what they wanted uh still they were put under eu rule where the eu
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:35.440]  unelected bureaucracy dominates the controls every facet of what they did but separate from that as
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:40.080]  you heard in the first hour we covered zero hedge we covered the london independent and others
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:47.680]  the london independent called it bizarre police state it's so over the top that if you say anything
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:53.280]  about one carlos the king of spain if you say you think he's ugly if you say he looks
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:02.800]  pardon me david no i just handed me some information alex uh the imf is now saying
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:08.400]  that they're not going to give greece the bailout this is amazing even after the trail of the greek
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.840]  people by the uh prime minister there the socialist prime minister for the european central bank and
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:20.960]  the imf and others they're now saying they're not going to even honor that agreement because the plan
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:26.640]  of the eu as we said 20 years ago as we said 10 years ago as we said in endgame as we said the
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.360]  obama deception as we said on record because the heads of the eu have said this is to take over
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:38.880]  nation states get them in debt implode them and then in national sovereignty so continuing here
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:45.600]  with this breakdown you see the moves of people desperate to be free desperate to get out from
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:55.440]  under 75 taxation as they have on average of even blue collar workers in spain 95 taxes on the middle
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:08.240]  class 101 on the nouveau rich 101 3 years running in france just north of me to bankrupt new wealth
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.280]  that threatens the hegemonic rule of the ultra rich who are above the law and don't pay taxes
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.760]  so that's what this whole story is about what you see happening in spain what you see happening in
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:25.760]  greece what you see happening in these areas is what's coming to the united states when we
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:30.400]  got off the plane i needed to exchange some cash so i could pay for taxi fares and stuff
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:35.440]  because a lot of folks want to be in the cashless want to be out of the cashless society
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:43.280]  so they want cash so i try to get 300 dollars changed into euros here in spain and they wanted
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:48.080]  my passport my driver's license where i was staying what i was doing what i would spend the money on
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:52.400]  they admittedly are bringing capital control to spain just as they've done to greece because
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.360]  they're getting ready to take people's bank accounts with the bail ins this is the exact same culture
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:05.520]  being brought to america it is so draconian to see our world being captured by these criminals
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:09.840]  and then to see how a lot of experts thought they wanted greece to default that's why they gave
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:13.840]  them deals the last three bailouts that were untenable that would bankrupt them and even when
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:19.520]  they agreed to an increase of vat of 15 percentage points on everything sold in the country even when
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:25.440]  they agreed to most of their public and private sector companies being taxed and handed over to
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:30.880]  foreign banks even as they agreed to having their islands turned over even as they agreed to total
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:36.160]  financial enslavement it wasn't enough as you're now reporting that they're saying we may not just
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:46.160]  give you this bailout this is the predatory plan and it's why here in spain rob do was out just
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.360]  videotaping on the street of a cathedral that we he wasn't filming the police that were back in the
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:56.640]  background look like ants in the shot they march over and they said under the new laws we can arrest
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:03.280]  you for doing that grabbed his camera erased it erased the information and then told us because
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:09.520]  of islamic terror we have to now take your freedom and we're sorry but we have to and i started saying
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:15.520]  to them they spoke somewhat decent english i said your government brings in the radical islamics
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:20.400]  they're funding ices this is a pretext to take freedom and they just said well this is just the
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:28.080]  way it is and so it's in the news that any criticism of won carlos the king who was put in by francisco
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:36.240]  franco who was hitler's adjunct basically during world war two any criticism is prison time they
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:43.920]  don't care who you are i mean imagine in the west any criticism of the king of spain it's like 500
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:50.880]  years ago is huge fines or prison time and then under the name of the king if you say our local
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:56.160]  police are lazy they're raising taxes too much uh they all basically want swimming pools and
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:03.520]  hammocks at their at their bases you are then fined or arrested this is in the west and there's
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.000]  nothing out of the us media there's some out of the british media some out of the german media
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:14.800]  but it's here fascism never really ended in spain it's simply back and i i i make the point another
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:20.400]  video at info wars.com the dominos are beginning to fall and that spain's the first domino that
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:27.280]  this is a sign that the global financial collapse is imminent by engineered design because they are
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:34.720]  unveiling classical fascism classical totalitarianism and while the very same foundations pushing this
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:40.560]  are financing attacks on the police communist terror attacks and a communist movement as the
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:46.560]  fake revolution that once the fascists come in they'll drive her one of the arms of communist
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.600]  in the hegelian dialectic of problem reaction solution that kerl quickly wrote about to bring
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:59.760]  us into the system so this is so unprecedented and i talked to folks in the uk i talked to people
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:04.960]  here in spain uh we're talking to so many people and they say no the economy's bad it's getting
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:12.080]  worse and they say it'd be okay but they keep raising the taxes i mean imagine being in france
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:19.040]  and being about 25 percent of the public people people making over 100 000 euros a year and you pay
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:27.760]  101 percent a retroactive tax three years running to make you quit to make you stop to make you
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.880]  shut down your restaurant shut down your car dealership shut down your hotel shut down your
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:39.680]  factory lay off your workers so they go on welfare and the big mega corporations tax exempt above the
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:45.040]  law just like with the bank consolidation the us a little bank shutting down under the regulations
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:49.920]  i was talking to a major head of a texas bank that has hundreds of branches they're shutting down
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.080]  retail they're shutting down loans they're shutting down housing loans they're shutting down
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:48:00.400]  everything because the regulations won't let them loan and the big banks are exempt do you
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:06.560]  understand folks this is the takeover this is feudalism where the big mega rich like one carlos
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:10.720]  and others don't want you to have a business don't want you to have a life don't want you
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:17.040]  to compete with them and then they scapegoat capitalism and blame it for what they themselves
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:26.000]  are doing that isn't capitalism that is fascism i mean it is so diabolical to see them squeezing
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:33.680]  people and absolutely harassing them and to to witness this and it hurts everybody i don't
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:37.840]  care who you are in america who you are in spain who you are in france who you are in the anana
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:44.240]  kingdom who you are anywhere in the world the this yoke of corruption this yoke of mega banks
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:49.200]  laundering the drug money and running the child kidnapping rings and promoting the abortion and
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:54.400]  promoting the tyranny and promoting the end of the family it's because they've taken over through
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:01.360]  fraud and every minute they're worried about what could unseat them justice family community
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:08.720]  common sense information informed people justice and freedom and private wealth threatens the
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:15.760]  hegemonic monopoly that's why it's at war with prosperity at war with free will at at war with
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:21.680]  everything decent because it's fundamentally rotten at its core and can't compete with it
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:26.800]  but i look at the shining eyes of the spanish people and i look at you know their strength and
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:32.320]  how they've thrown off tyranny so many other times and i know they will my god they don't get to vote
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:37.680]  on e-u tyranny just like the uk just like england and scotland and ireland can vote on fighting
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.000]  with each other all day and can vote on seceding because it doesn't matter if they secede from the
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:50.160]  uk the uk has 92 of its laws it was 80 last year made by the unelected dictatorship david and i
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:53.360]  were going to break it about a minute i'm going to come back and cover some of their issues with
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:59.200]  you but uh it's just amazing to see how open and naked tyranny has now gotten well alex what you
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:05.200]  were just saying in terms of the european control of the individual states there's an article today
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:10.880]  about the european parliament debating whether they're going to let european countries ban gmo
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:15.760]  so now we've seen the same thing there in europe and they're trying to make this united states of
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:20.800]  europe same thing we've seen here with the dark act the supposedly safe and accurate labeling
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:27.600]  act that was passed in congress to shut down any control over food or food labeling by local
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:31.520]  governments that's what they're doing in europe they're shutting that down for previously sovereign
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:40.240]  states i'm glad you raised that three unions north american asian e-u circumventing national
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:46.800]  sovereignty and as you said just like the tpp e-u ban labeling this is the tyranny this is the end
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:51.360]  of choice this is the end of humans being able to vote with their dollars or euros we'll be back

[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:23.520]  battery again i'm your host alex jones coasting with david knight is in austin texas i'm in
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:29.840]  barcelona spain we're going to be covering more events here but it is shocking to have police
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:35.440]  march over when you're videotaping in public and say under new rules no taping allowed in public
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:41.280]  and to then threaten to arrest us and to just experience the journalists and others that
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:48.320]  mildly just say i disagree with the government i disagree with the king i disagree with uh
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:55.600]  this activity you are fined or arrested here in spain and even mainstream media says it's bizarre
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:02.320]  police state bizarre oppression no this is the model worldwide this is what they want to bring
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:11.120]  in and under the new EU rules can't criticize monsanto if spain or grace or france who've all banned gmo
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:21.120]  trans species want to say no doesn't matter there's no sovereignty EU says and i'm glad david knight
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:33.680]  raises that because that is the level of just incredible colossal bizarro land surreal tyranny
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:39.360]  that we're talking about you got to ask yourself the globalists are already in control why are they
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.840]  doing this because they want to be able to put shots in you when they want they want to be able to
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:48.160]  take money for national health care and they're not give you care they want to be able to feed you
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:55.440]  gmo that sterilizes rats and make you accept it they want to run your life it's about power
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:01.200]  it's about control it's the same reason these satanists are showing up protesting to keep
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:06.880]  killing babies and showing up with bathroom that statues and selling tickets to support abortion
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:13.360]  because they got a god and they serve it they follow it they live it they talk to talk they
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:18.720]  walk don't walk they may be chicken necked they may be ugly they may be stupid they may be weak
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:24.960]  but they know how to serve their god they know how to tithe they know how to give they love their god
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:32.240]  well forget god okay for all you atheists out there do you serve anything like bob dillon says
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:39.120]  you got to serve somebody well i serve the truth and i serve strength and the individual
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:47.600]  and i serve the power of the people and at a fundamental genetic level i hate these parasites
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:54.960]  in their big gangs i mean we all hate seeing a video on national geographic of say plenty
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:02.800]  african dogs pulling down a lion and killing it or we hate seeing an elephant being being taken
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:08.080]  down by 2030 hyenas and it stomps them and it hits them and it kills 10 of them but still
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:12.560]  they all gang up and pull it down and rip its trunk off and rip its eyes out you know at a
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:18.160]  fundamental level we just see it for what it is predatory weak pathetic some will argue
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:24.720]  and survival of the fittest well i know this they built an artificial construct to use our energy
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:31.680]  and our will to build their breakaway civilization so here's the message maybe they're right maybe
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:37.600]  you don't have what it takes maybe i don't maybe we are dominated maybe we are failed maybe
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:42.080]  genetically and spiritually i'm wrong that i don't want to hurt innocents and i don't want to
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:47.200]  dumb people down to use them like cattle maybe i'm a failure that i didn't join the new world order
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:52.320]  and use my intelligence to dominate make millions of dollars and be immune from prosecution and
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:57.920]  be above the law but you know what my soul says that's a fraud and i know it is and i'll never

[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:20.640]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:30.400]  we've found a bunch of reports from barcelona more coming from europe in multiple countries
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:35.520]  where they have raised the taxes cut off the resources shut off the coal power plants to
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:40.720]  the point that europe is collapsing in fact no country in europe statistically admittedly
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:46.720]  has been more economically destroyed than spain spain has had more than 200 major
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:50.960]  coal powered clean plants that just put out carbon dioxide and water vapor
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:56.560]  shut down the last seven eight years they put up wind farms that are a boondoggle that don't
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:01.040]  supply the energy that don't deliver the energy to where it's going they lose about half of it
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:07.200]  on the lines and uh when you people say i don't care about coal screw them when you take
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:12.880]  cheap energy and you you make it expensive then no one can have factories no one can have jobs
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:17.840]  people have less discretionary income it's all going to pay for your power bill the electric cars
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:23.920]  go off of it everything slows down i mean the first thing you do in a military operation
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:28.320]  in world war two or korea or vietnam is bomb power plants well the globalists don't bomb
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:32.640]  power plants they just go hey i'm trendy i'm a liberal we're gonna shut your power plants off
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:38.720]  it's for the earth uh knowing that they want you to have less discretionary income they go hey it's
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:44.800]  trendy 250 square foot apartments so we can raise your taxes on you i mean it's feudalism
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:50.800]  feudalism was about keeping people at a subsistence level or below it as political control so you
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:56.320]  were so busy under economic domination that you couldn't ever be involved anything else
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:00.800]  so the nobility can ride by on their horses and look at the commoners who are about a foot or
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:05.360]  two shorter from malnutrition and they have five six kids two of them would be from mineral
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:12.000]  deficiencies totally mentally retarded this is in japanese culture european culture as tech culture
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.160]  and they would call them the little people they'd have snot all over their faces starving
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:21.200]  and and they'd ride by keeping on about five to ten percent of the land to survive
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:25.280]  if you killed a rabbit or a deer to eat they'd kill your whole family slit your throats
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.720]  hang upside down burn at the stake whatever and uh it's back the same deal feudalism same
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:36.880]  royalty same people same scum mixed up with the Rothschilds and uh that's austerity that's
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:42.560]  gen 21 that's their plan and once they get you addicted though to free government handouts
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:48.480]  and welfare then they think you'll stay bound to the system as they slowly turn off the resources
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:56.000]  the truth is free market can deliver unlimited resources unlimited renaissance anything you
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.680]  can imagine look how much we've progressed in a hundred years but globalism is about stopping
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:06.960]  that progression and only letting you have resources and tools and technology that are
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:14.240]  trojan horses delivered from the gods in the pelaner fields in the golden fields of elysium
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:20.400]  and so we need to understand we don't want to break away elysium the greek legend of those
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:25.200]  that serve the gods those that serve the elite given life extension given the power we understand
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:32.640]  the human mind that envisioned elysium can build elysium can build the fire of prometheus for
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:38.880]  everyone and it's not the devil who lies and tells the occult that he is prometheus it is the god of
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:44.720]  the heavens that has given us the promethean fire to be able to go to the next level and the system
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:49.920]  will never be able to suppress the human spirit from attaining that fire you do not have to serve
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:56.320]  the illuminati to gain the fire that is a false fire that is a false light the illuminati is not
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:01.360]  illumined and you will only be illuminated when you have gotten your heart and realized that what
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:06.080]  you do to the least of me you've done to me as christ said so i'm going to throw it back to david
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:11.680]  knight who's doing a fabulous job co-hosting the show i'll be back tomorrow lord willing live more
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:15.760]  street reports more on the ground reports that the other reports we haven't aired yet today
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:20.400]  are on info wars dot com if you want to air some of those with watson do what are the names of the
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:25.280]  reports we shot like three or four that one of them's got bad audio we're trying to fix it where i
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:29.040]  saw the street musician that was levitating and i point out how it ties in the private
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:34.560]  federal reserve and it's a con game of creating you know false money how your conspiracy theorists
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:39.200]  did you point out how the guy levitating in the streets of barcelona isn't really levitating
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:44.640]  it's a pretty powerful video we've got a bunch of those coming up at info wars dot com but i'm
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:50.800]  just excited about the the energy of humanity and the fact that in my gut in my spirit i know
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:56.640]  we're going to prevail over this tyranny but the enemy attack is launching is intensifying so god
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:02.800]  bless you all david knight the devil obsessed cult that brought you that huge bronze baphomet statue
[02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:08.240]  is now funding a huge effort to undermine anti-abortion legislation the satanic temple says
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:14.720]  that proceeds from ticket sales from the largest public satanic ceremony in history will be used
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:20.880]  to support the reproductive rights legal action fund the cult which clearly aligns itself with the
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:26.080]  devil even though they claim not to believe you really exists has a questionable statement on its
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:32.000]  website suggesting that the reason they support abortion is to do with personal choice and women's
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:39.200]  rights not an identification with historical satanic child sacrifice or you know doing the evil
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:44.240]  bidding of the dark lord then the satanic temple recently launched a federal lawsuit against the
[02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:50.160]  state of missouri claiming that the state's laws restricting abortion violate their free exercise
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:56.640]  of satanism and that abortion is an essential religious duty for satanists leon macadoo for info

[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:58.560]  and tomorrow at info warslife.com now going to this article apol joseph wasan has up on info wars.com
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:03.600]  university of new hampshire says using the word american is defensive but not just that word they
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:08.800]  have a long list of beast normal mothering fathering senior citizen homosexual illegal alien
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:13.200]  those are all discouraged you know paul i'd like to see if they could come up with a euphemism for
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:18.000]  bald so i didn't have to feel so bad about losing my hair you know i still wouldn't grow hair but i
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.600]  could feel better about it maybe for a little while what do you think well that's that's partly
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:29.120]  what it's about david it's about this cult of victimhood where you know instead of facing up to
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:35.120]  people's problems like you know obese for example you've got the whole fat pride movement which tries
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:40.640]  to take obesity of course which is incredibly unhealthy and should not be encouraged and turn
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:47.360]  it into this social justice warrior movement so this is a bias free language guide posted on the
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:53.680]  official university of new hampshire website and to his credit the university of new hampshire president
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:59.920]  has come out even he has come out and basically said this is ridiculous of course they say using
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:06.080]  the word american is offensive because it's not inclusive of people from south america all those
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:11.520]  other examples you mentioned normal mothering fathering homosexual illegal alien senior citizens
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:17.280]  they're all offensive and they're all to be discouraged but what this is about is again
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:23.280]  mainstreaming lunacy people pick holes in some articles that i write and say well this is just
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:29.200]  some idiot some extreme leftist radicals on twitter or tumblr that are coming out with this
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:34.080]  but it's not as we saw with the previous article from the university of wisconsin
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:39.760]  where they said that complimenting people of color or saying for example that an asian person is
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:46.080]  good at maths is a racial microaggression and this is coming from the universities this is what
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:51.840]  faculty and students are being taught so it's not just some extreme crazy radicals on the internet
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:57.200]  this is what the next generation is learning this is what is being mainstreamed right now
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:05.520]  in america at the college level absolutely paul you know when i look at this
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:09.680]  when we look at language control that's really about population control just like we talk about
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:14.400]  gun control that's really population control this is about intimidating people isn't it paul
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:19.920]  it's about creating a climate of intimidation and it's also when we look at political terms i mean
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:24.560]  that that's a huge political aspect right there but when we look at some of these political terms
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:28.720]  they're really seizing the high ground of political debate because if you can define the
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:32.880]  terms you can define the argument so there's multiple aspects of this that we should all
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:38.800]  be very worried about but i think the key thing to me in looking at all this at first glance it
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:43.920]  looks silly it looks hypersensitive it looks politically correct but it really is a form
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:52.000]  of control and intimidation yeah it's it's about changing the definition of words and phrases
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  it's not about being sensitive to people and not wanting to offend people look at the examples
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:03.280]  you know they say calling people illegal aliens is politically incorrect offensive but then what
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:11.200]  do they suggest it's replaced with quote person seeking asylum or refugee so of course that
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:17.360]  completely eliminates all the pejorative context from illegal immigrants somebody breaking the law to
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:23.360]  illegally enter the country and turns them into some kind of political refugee the same with other
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:30.240]  examples as i said you know they say replace obese or overweight with quote people of size
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:36.960]  so again that completely eliminates the context that being obese is a bad thing and not something
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:42.480]  that should be accepted or encouraged of course we're not going to bully people and call them names
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:48.240]  because they're overweight but the whole fat pride movement that this is attached to actually encourages
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:54.400]  body positivity for grossly obese people so it's actually harming their health making them more
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:15:02.080]  likely to succumb to terminal illnesses they also talk about ciscentrism which quote includes the
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:08.400]  lack of gender neutral restrooms locker rooms and residences at the university so again it's
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:14.400]  it's all about creating this cult of victimhood where everybody's a special little snowflake
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:21.040]  and your free speech your language the very words that you use need to be curtailed even at
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:28.800]  university which is supposed to be a bastion of free speech where open free discussion is encouraged
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:34.320]  now in many universities in america it's the opposite you know they have safe spaces when
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:40.240]  dissident feminists like christina hoff summers go to a university to do a talk about how insane
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:45.600]  third wave feminism is these students have to escape to these safe spaces where they won't come
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:50.960]  in contact with any of the talking points that she brings to her presentation so instead of
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:56.160]  open being about open and free discussion which is what universities were about in the past and
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:03.360]  should be about it's about curtailing free speech it's about sensorious programs that dictate that
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:08.960]  this kind of language is some kind of thought crime and even to alter it is to be offensive and
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:13.520]  politically incorrect yeah you know it's been that way at university for a long time i'm i'm pretty
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:17.280]  old i went when i was getting my electrical engineering degree i had to be very careful
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:23.520]  about the classes of professors that i had because there were all these uh uh all these marxists
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:29.920]  basically that were trying to harass and intimidate you to use their classes as a tool of social
[02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:35.840]  control as a tool of manipulation but of course now all the guilt tripping about white privilege
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:41.760]  has become systemic throughout the universities all of them pretty much of course the mtv program
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:48.960]  that we covered before i really hate to see this kind of cultural marxism uh again as i said it's
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:54.880]  just a form of control and intimidation and it's absolutely outrageous it's amazing it's also
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:59.040]  ridiculous when we look at things like obese or overweight being replaced by the euphemism
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:06.880]  people of size people of size of what size that's the issue i guess right paul yeah i mean you
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:12.480]  mentioned the mtv thing again that a lot of actual liberals though you'll find now are coming out and
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:18.000]  rebelling against this because they see that basically the craziest people have seized control
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:24.240]  of the dialogue of the narrative and now they're in these key positions of power at universities
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:30.720]  in the media not only did we have the mtv white privilege show which aired about a week ago now
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:36.560]  you know telling white people that they should be ashamed for example about what happened to the
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:41.600]  native americans which they have no connection to whatsoever despite the fact that you know all the
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:46.560]  native american tribes were killing each other that doesn't matter it's white people that are evil
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:53.280]  and then after that they put out another video which again touched upon the university of wisconsin
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:59.520]  microaggressions things like you know saying that you liked black culture was racist but also not
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:04.560]  liking black culture was racist so basically whatever you say you're racist if you're white
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:08.880]  you're born a racist which is basically what these social justice warriors believe and then
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.400]  you have to live your entire life um as an act of apology simply for your skin color which is of
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:20.640]  course inherently racist so this is coming out at the educational level it's coming out at the media
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:27.200]  level and you know if you're active on twitter as i am you know that these people have seized control
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:32.720]  of the narrative in many areas of political discussion on twitter and that's why it's a big
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:37.360]  threat because they are controlling the narrative to a great extent and if you're not embroiled in
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:44.240]  that on a day-to-day basis as i am then it's easy to dismiss it as just some radical extremists on
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:49.280]  tumblr or whatever but you know this this has gone really far now with all these different
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:54.640]  free speech guides being given to students and faculty members at universities telling them
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:59.920]  what they can and can't say and you know something that might offend the precious little snowflakes
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:04.080]  and it is a threat to free speech and it's a growing one you know there's a little bit of
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.640]  shade and fray to hear uh paul on my part when i look at this and i look at the nonsense of this
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:13.840]  the Marxism of this i'm thinking that these people are paying fantastic amounts of money
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:19.120]  to go into debt in a university system getting a degree that is going to be absolutely irrelevant
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:23.840]  and useless to their lives so that's going to you know what goes around comes around before
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:27.760]  we go to break and we're going to be back with paul in the next segment we have a breaking story
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:33.840]  at me uh from michael valin at info wars of course he broke the news and an interview with hackers

[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:25.440]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david not your host in austin and joining us now is
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:32.560]  paul joseph watson from the uk we've been talking about the weaponization of our language that is
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:37.600]  taking place primarily in the universities that's where they're beginning all of this the uh
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:43.600]  preoccupation with white privilege now it's taken to an absurd level at the university new hampshire
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:49.680]  where they have a bias free language guide where they're basically redefining everything but understand
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:55.760]  that behind this this is not just about intimidation of people that's a big part of it they talk about
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:02.640]  microaggression really they're the ones being aggressive but language control like gun control
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:09.200]  like transportation control is people control that's fundamentally what this is about this is what
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:15.360]  these marxists are really trying to do as well as defining the terms of the debate and seizing
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:21.680]  the high ground by defining those terms going back to paul joseph watson paul uh break this
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:28.800]  down some more for us yeah it's exactly that it's about hijacking the terms that we all use on a
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:33.840]  day-to-day basis and either saying that now they mean something else or that they're racist and
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:38.320]  politically incorrect i mean alex talks about it often you know they they stop using the term
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:43.920]  brown bags up in seattle because that could be considered racist and every single day i post
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:50.320]  examples from people who are going to these universities they post stuff on twitter like
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:56.320]  you know if you order beef well done then that's racist because there's a history of white people
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:02.560]  giving spoiled beef to african-american slaves and it's that kind of insanity that now dominates
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:08.800]  much of the narrative and it's also now took you know it's took firm grasp in universities
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:14.000]  and that's why we're seeing more of this come out every single week now yeah it's just it also
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:20.160]  underscores as i as we said before how silly and irrelevant the universities have become hasn't it
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:25.040]  i would not call the institutions the higher learning for most cases i don't think people
[02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:30.560]  need to go into massive debt to get most of these degrees i mean even for technical degrees
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:34.880]  or law degrees or doctor degrees i mean that's the only way you can get into those fields
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:38.400]  nevertheless it's starting to get to the point where it doesn't really pay
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.800]  well no and then they complain about you know the gender pay gap while taking gender studies
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:48.640]  degrees that are no good to anyone you're not going to get a job out of it so you know it's a
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:53.600]  vicious circle and then going on to this you know cessell the lion controversy which you talked
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:59.920]  about yesterday of course trophy hunting is representable it's basically just um shooting
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:05.520]  something that's been imprisoned in a pen and then posing with its dead body it actually discred
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:12.000]  its hunting it's reprehensible but the thing about this cessell the lion issue is peter came out and
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.720]  accused this walter palmer this lion hunter of quote lacking empathy understanding and respect for
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:23.120]  living creatures this is an organization that literally their business model revolves around
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:31.280]  slaughtering healthy defenseless animals 96 percent of the animals that come through peter's doors
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:37.840]  end up dead so peter is out there lecturing us all on how such a big shame this cessell the lion
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:43.840]  killing is which it is meanwhile they're literally killing healthy kittens and dumping them in
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:50.560]  garbage bags while people give their donations to peter in the name of cessell the lion so again
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:57.200]  just this rampant hypocrisy that surrounds all these contrived outrage campaigns yes it's outrageous
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:02.720]  but then to allow people who are so hypocritical to seize that narrative and use it to raise money
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:07.440]  again it's completely reprehensible and that's what peter's doing right now and of course we see
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:12.880]  all these organizations there's a story by cat daniel is talking about how leftists suggest that
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:19.200]  african lions are more important than african americans because they certainly do care less
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:24.320]  about all the murders by african americans than they do about ccell the lion if you look at the
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:29.200]  number of column inches that they devote to this as i was saying earlier you know yeah trophy hunting
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:33.360]  that's one issue but let's talk about the planned parenthood people they don't talk about that either
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:39.040]  they don't talk about how they're doing uh how they're hunting babies to essentially buy their
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:46.560]  trophy cars and their trophy homes i find that important well the ccell the lion is you've got
[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:51.840]  more coverage from us news networks in one day than the planned parenthood videos have
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:57.120]  received over the past two weeks yes and then again you look at somebody like kermit gosnell
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:03.120]  you know who killed babies after they were born it took 56 days for all three broadcast networks
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:09.600]  in the us to even report on that there was no huge public shaming campaign against kermit gosnell
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:14.880]  because that wasn't liberal that wasn't trendy so again we care more about big cats than we do
[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:19.520]  defenseless human babies and that's a big problem well you know actually you know paul you talked
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:25.120]  about kermit gosnell we talked about the fourth video they're coming out very rapidly now i think
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:28.880]  they're trying to do it before they get a restraining order put on there and we had in this fourth
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:33.440]  video they say sometimes if someone delivers before we get to see them for a procedure
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:38.720]  then we have an intact baby that's the ghoulishness of these people who are out there looking for
[02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:43.360]  their lambos stay with us right after the break we're going to have a special report from alex
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:49.600]  jones spain the next domino to fall will be right back thank you out we're on the march the empires

[02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:08.400]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:19.760]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night earlier in the show we were joined live
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:26.640]  by alex jones in spain and of course alex is going to the various european countries that
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:30.560]  are on their perimeter looking to see if they're going to do to spain to idli these other countries
[02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:34.880]  what they are doing to greece and of course we just learned today that although it looked like
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:40.640]  greece had been forced to accept a recessionary bailout deal that's what cyprus said he says well
[02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:49.040]  we're not proud of it but we have created some cracks in european neoliberal hegemony well no
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:55.360]  you didn't because even as bad as this second deal is and it was far worse than the first deal
[02:33:55.360 --> 02:34:01.920]  but the greek people said no to but that cyprus their socialist leader said yes to as bad as that
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:09.120]  deal was now the imf is saying and private memos that have come out from uh it is the uh london
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:15.600]  financial times yes the financial times and this was also put out by business insider saying leaked
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:22.720]  memos say that imf negotiators are not interested in participating in policy discussions until
[02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:29.040]  other conditions are met so imf is looking like they're going to back out of this as well
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:34.720]  well alex jones is filing reports as he's going through these countries in europe we have another
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:42.400]  one right here spain the next domino to fall here's alex jones's report i want to be clear
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:49.600]  as we report from the hilltops above barcelona spain the new world order global corporate
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:58.080]  fascist combine is not a nazi conspiracy it is not a nazi conspiracy the nazis themselves
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:04.640]  were a spinoff of the robber barons of europe england and the united states trying to formulate
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:10.720]  a governmental plan for the world and there was a debate between communism and fascism
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:16.240]  this is in the mainline history books around the time of 1900 they bankrolled both major
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:21.840]  movements all the big megabanks powerful combines had made their fortunes by funding
[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:28.960]  both sides over and over and over again but when you look at spain this parallel is never
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:35.840]  been clear it was the treaty of roam in 57 that set up the european union is a so-called trade
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:40.960]  deal just like nafta and gat by stealth now as they implode the nation states with artificial
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:48.320]  debt their answer is get rid of any sovereignty this is in the news and transfer all power to the
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:53.840]  unelected eu dictatorship that is run by the same private central banks that have gotten
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.480]  the country's asylum to debt and then when you look at the parallels of how spain was
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:04.160]  fascist in world war two and then never got any trouble for it right up until 1975 when
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:13.040]  francisco franca handed over power to won carlos and passed through the power chain down to pick
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:18.880]  the prince who he personally trained and groomed to be the successor who is in control of spain
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:27.280]  today and they just have a semi you know vestigial elected government or ceremonial is more the word
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:33.040]  they act like the king of ceremonial and vestigial but in truth he has the constitutional powers
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:38.880]  and the control and again they were able to get the people to support the fascist model because
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:43.280]  the alternative is to be invaded basically by the middle east in africa and taken over and
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:48.560]  to go under islamic rule or to have gone under communist rule so this is why the globalist
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:55.040]  time and time again end up funding both sides of any equation or in some cases all three sides
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:59.440]  is so that they can then judge the outcome of the battle and then throw their weight behind
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:04.080]  the organization that basically works with them and goes along with their ultimate plan sometimes
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:07.840]  they'll even betray a group that works with them and then double back and put somebody else in
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:14.320]  control and what happened to hitler and musolini was a great example of that they were basically
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:19.360]  set up you want to come and talk all right brother a lot of folks recognize them for
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:24.000]  us which is exciting you show people understand what's happening and so you have to understand
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.640]  the e you is a totalitarian movement it is destroying sovereignty in any country that
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:32.960]  goes along with its demands never gets out of debt you only get more debt and and you end up with
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:39.680]  50% unemployment like some areas 40% unemployment that spain has because they want you domesticated
[02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:43.760]  they use economic warfare as a tool of control and whether it's fascist chronic capitalism or
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:49.200]  whether it's communism they don't care because it's centralized and carol quickly in his book
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:53.760]  tragedy and hope that was written secretly for the state department but then later released
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:38:00.240]  admits all this to 1100 page book it's on the scribe and different sites online we we sell the
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:04.800]  book at info or store.com if you want to read it it's back in print you can read the angle
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:08.880]  american establishment written by carol quickly you can read brzezinski's five books what's so
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:13.680]  frustrating to me is this is all admitted brzezinski in his book the technotronic era written in
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:18.960]  the 70s admits the government's control the narcotics trade he admits that they finance both
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:24.480]  sides of the wars and that's how they control people they put mousy tongue into power who killed
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:31.840]  you know 80 plus million people uh so just understand these people are absolutely evil
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:36.400]  and i use the emperor palpatine analogy a lot because when episode three came out a decade ago
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:42.080]  mainstream news said we don't understand this plot we don't get it first they're fighting against
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:45.600]  the trade federation then they're not fighting against it and then all of a sudden the emperor
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:51.440]  takes over well he's a senator who stages an attack on his planet to get more power
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:55.440]  and to become prominent then he gets elected chancellor gets more power out of the next
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:59.440]  terror attack that happens and then finally he wipes out the internal police forces and the
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:03.600]  old republic to make himself dictator doubling back and saying that they're the terrorist see
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:07.280]  that's exactly what's happening in america the liberty movement they claim the police state
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:15.200]  is to fight radical islamic terror but then they turn around and they say that it's for the veterans
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:22.640]  the gun owners the patriots the old republic i mean and lucas even came out in a vanity fair
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:27.840]  article well he gave a press conference it was a vanity fair it was also in hollywood reporter
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:32.480]  and said don't you get it this is what happened on 9 11 he says i'm gonna leave it at that but
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:37.840]  this movie i rewrote it episode three this is 9 11 which is where a central government gets power
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:42.720]  out of basically financing an outside group to attack letting them attack then turning around
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:46.960]  double crossing them taking the liberties domestically but also conquering the outlying
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:52.160]  planets which you interchange for outlying countries uh this is a galleon dialectic this
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:58.240]  is macchiavellian systems it's not that complex but see the public couldn't understand it because
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:02.960]  it was so real as an allegory just come out of the cave break your conditioning realize what's
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:08.320]  happening and realize that they're warning the public in the press don't even talk about this
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:13.120]  here and that's why we then dared to come here i was just going to go to grace and just go to
[02:40:13.120 --> 02:40:17.840]  italy but then when i saw the major shift in spain that's been happening for a long time
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:23.120]  towards total fascism we had to come here and see this historical event as it unfolds the people
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:30.000]  built that there are their beauty it's a wonderful culture here in spain and it's sad to see it
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.960]  caught between radical islamic garbage and communism and being forced to go with fascism
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:40.960]  and the people have a lot of courage here they have a lot of honor uh and uh i believe that spain
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:46.000]  is going to be able to come through this uh they've so far bowed the e u on record uh and are just
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:50.960]  being torn apart and it just gets worse and worse to see the e u being able to do this and it was
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:56.720]  a proto-nazi program to conquer europe by economics not by military control so spain couldn't be
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:01.680]  conquered or or or reconquered itself from radical islam spain threw off so many other
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:06.560]  invasions or so many other texts spain once was a greater empire than uh the england and now they've
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:11.440]  been conquered by a bunch of slimy bankers and suits who have their puppet king who they finance
[02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:14.960]  and control i mean i've been to billardberg when won carlos is there meeting secretly
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:17.760]  and that's why they don't want this discussed they don't want the public to even know daniel
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:22.320]  estlund who lives in spain has the number one bestselling book here for like a decade running
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:27.680]  because the people are hungry for the truth and so that's the good news and i believe we have courage
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:32.240]  and stand up against this that uh spain and the rest of the world can find a way out of this but
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:37.280]  spain is next probably to be collapsed that are portugal and then italy uh we're going to roam to
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:41.520]  show what the london telegraph and others have said is basically imminent collapse all right that's
[02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:45.600]  another report from the ground where we're talking to folks on the street and more a lot of key reports
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:52.640]  coming up alex jones4mfallwars.com again that's alex jones reporting from spain spain the next
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:58.720]  domino to fall is the name of that report and as we were talking to alex when he was on with us live
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:03.280]  we were talking about how you know many people are concerned about what happened in greece
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:10.080]  certainly the people have gotten a horrible deal there part of that deal is taking away their
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:14.720]  sovereignty starting to dictate to them how their laws are going to be laws that might affect the
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:22.720]  bankers profits and even this bad second deal is now being reneged on by the imf according to
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:28.240]  documents that have been leaked to the financial times we can see that it's not just greece however
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:33.920]  where they're taking over control the european parliament is debating whether they will let
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:40.960]  individual countries ban gmo's the same thing we see happening in this country so they've already
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:44.640]  lost their sovereignty look at what's happening in the united states and of course this is all
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:50.160]  what the trans-pacific transatlantic partnerships are about it's about turning over the sovereignty
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:56.160]  of our countries to the corporations who are writing those agreements they will then prohibit
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:43:02.000]  at a global level anything that will harm the profits of big pharmaceutical companies
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:08.640]  of big corporations like monsanto they will establish extensive copyright controls over
[02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:12.320]  everything and those copyright controls will not only make them incredibly rich leave them
[02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:18.720]  the owners of everything but it will also be used to control the internet as a means of saying that
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:23.840]  they have to exercise internet control we have this article showing what's happening here in the
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:28.640]  united states of course baner mcconnell are destroying the party from the top this is from
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:35.360]  wnd well i would say i don't really care if baner and mcconnell destroy the party they don't care
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:41.520]  about the gop i don't care about the gop we care about issues but of course regardless of what
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:48.960]  happens to the country and of course the open borders are about bringing in cheap labor exporting
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:55.040]  jobs importing workers for their corporate masters people like the us chamber of commerce that's why
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:44:00.160]  baner and mcconnell won't do anything that's why nobody else in the gop will do anything
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:04.960]  you've been had it was less than a year ago that you voted for them to do something about obama
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:09.840]  care which is crony capitalism you voted for them to do something about the open borders
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:15.520]  which is crony capitalism really but of course they're not instead what they did was they handed
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:21.920]  over their sovereignty their responsibility their their duty to pass legislative laws they've handed
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:27.600]  that over now to the corporate lobbyists who are writing these sovereignty destroying economy
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:33.760]  destroying treaties that they call free trade that's what this has all been about you know they
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:39.520]  sell us the runaway welfare state and they do that in other countries like venezuela and greece
[02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:46.320]  they do that best with a socialist at the helm but it also works with republicans there as well
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:51.840]  because this is fundamentally corporatism it is fundamentally fascism as alex was pointing out
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:56.960]  they have these phony two different sides they put the they put mal in charge they it was german
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:03.600]  bankers who put linen in charge of russia but then we were told that hitler and russia were on
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:09.360]  the opposite sides no not true it's the same guys who are running this scam everywhere let's talk
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:14.960]  about the open borders let's use that term that we're not supposed to say illegal alien yes because
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:20.240]  alien means that they're not a citizen and illegal means that they are doing this they're here in
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:25.280]  violation non-citizens in violation of the law we have a story up on info wars dot com angry judge
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:31.840]  rails against immigration system as an illegal alien faces rape and murder charges he says we
[02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:37.200]  don't even know who he is now what has happened here this is a story from biz pack review let's
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:41.200]  say failure to enforce immigration laws has again left an innocent woman shot to death
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:47.440]  another wounded a teenager sexually assaulted and a judge on the war path an illegal alien 35 is
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:51.840]  accused of fatally shooting a 60 year old woman attempting to kill another woman attempting to
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:58.480]  rape his own 14 year old niece on monday and this came just weeks after the us border patrol
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:04.160]  refused to take him into custody because he hadn't committed a crime other than being here illegally
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:09.440]  because those crimes don't matter selective enforcement of the law how about equal protection
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:18.320]  of the law for american citizens let's play the clip from wkyc it turns out police met razo at least
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:24.400]  once before three weeks ago lake county sheriff's deputies responding to calls of a suspicious vehicle
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:31.040]  at a panesville golf course razo comes out from a wooded area and admits to being in the us illegally
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:38.560]  the report says a call to us border patrol and a detective decides not to retain razo and he was
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:46.720]  free to go so he's free to go again catch and release they don't do this for americans we can
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:52.640]  have illegal aliens under the secure communities act they were supposed to have been turned over to
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:57.040]  ice if they had fingerprints on file that would mean that they had previously created a crime
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:02.720]  meaning that that could be something where they were deported once and then they decided well you
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:06.880]  know i really still don't care about your borders so i'm going to come back in again or it could be
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:12.000]  a violent crime but they were supposed to turn them over to ice to deport them because you know
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:17.360]  what when you violate the immigration laws you're still violating the laws but of course as we've
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:23.440]  seen here in austin and i went to a meeting where the democrat party haranged a black democrat
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:28.400]  sheriff and told him you're in the wrong party you're supporting this secure communities act he
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:34.800]  says i'm simply doing my job as law enforcement when i see people who have a criminal record
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:39.040]  i am turning them over as i'm required to do under federal law but they wanted him
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:44.800]  to ignore the law to violate the law and of course our police chief art usavado is doing that
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:50.640]  so this guy gets turned loose and he goes out and again as i mentioned he killed a 60 year old
[02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:56.000]  woman he attempted to kill another woman he attempted to rape his 14 year old and when he's
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:01.440]  brought before the judge this is what the judge has to say i can't set a bond high enough i cannot
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:06.880]  set one high enough if i have somebody that we don't even know who he is why he's in this country
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:13.600]  why he's here illegally and why he allegedly committed a murder finally we get somebody who
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:19.120]  is angry about this it's good to see that happening you know i was just talking in the last uh in the
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:25.280]  first half hour to paul joseph watson and we're talking about how language is being manipulated
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:33.600]  i saw this amazing interview on npr with woody allen and as part of this interview listen to how
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:39.360]  they play with language they come to him and they say the separation between church and state between
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:44.240]  artists and their personal lives do you think the allegations that you sexually abused your
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:49.280]  adopted daughter dylan farrow do you think those have affected how people approach your movies
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:57.920]  you hear that do you hear that if he's got allegations of him sexually abusing his adopted
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:04.480]  daughter that's just a separation of church and state issue really according to npr that's just
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:09.200]  a separation of church and state and of course it's not just that it's woody allen's interview
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:15.120]  which is making headlines and all different kinds of outlets where he's talking about his quote
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:23.120]  unquote paternal relationship with soon ye now to back this all up woody allen at the time was
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:27.760]  living with uh meo farrow they had a they didn't officially get married but they adopted children
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:33.440]  together they had a child together and she also had adopted children from a previous marriage one
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:40.960]  of those was soon ye when their relationship began she was eight years old when that relationship
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:47.520]  ended soon ye was 20 years old the reason that relationship between mea farrow and soon ye ended
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:54.960]  was because mea farrow found nude pictures of soon ye that woody allen had taken i don't know
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:50:01.920]  what age she was when that happened but that in and of itself should raise a lot of questions
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:07.920]  especially the fact that woody allen starts talking about in this interview how he says
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:14.640]  i was paternal she responded to someone paternal now he switched a couple of letters around there
[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:24.880]  he was parental he was parental okay he was 62 at the time and she was 20 he was her parent he had
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:30.960]  a parent relationship with her but he says she responded to someone paternal i liked her youth
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:39.040]  and energy it was just a fling but then there became more of it and we got serious so he got
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:44.480]  serious about this 20 year old when he's 62 years old and he's her parent but of course
[02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:49.440]  all this can just be dismissed as some kind of a weirdo separation of church and state issue you
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:55.120]  know we shouldn't get into that we have completely lost our moral foundation stay with us we'll be

[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:17.280]  now coming back to the news we had a story that i didn't get to yesterday made me think about it
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:20.640]  when i was talking about woody allen the last segment because kind of like you know you've
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:24.720]  seen the pictures of jonathan price the actor who was in brazil and the current pope i mean
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:30.000]  they look like doppelgangers i mean these guys look like they were brothers separate twin brothers
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:37.280]  separated at birth when i was talking about woody allen it reminded me of allen dirshowitz story
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:41.920]  he came out and said the second amendment is an absurd thing in our constitution if i could write
[02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:48.720]  the bill of rights over again i would skip amendment number two this is a harvard law professor
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:54.160]  the ameritas he said we've tried an experiment for the last 250 years and it's failed miserably we
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:59.760]  have to start a new approach well i would say that the experiment of america of constitutional america
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:05.920]  was really only tried for about 80 years and we created a corporate empire it was a corporation
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:09.760]  and it was an empire not a republic he says if i could write the bill of rights over again i would
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:14.960]  skip amendment number two where the only country in the world that puts in our constitution the right
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:20.240]  to bear arms it's an absurd thing to be in our constitution but it's in our constitution we
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:26.000]  have to live with it well at least he says that at least he doesn't just ignore it like the supreme
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:33.920]  court like our legislators at the state level at the local level at the national level that is an
[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:40.880]  absolute right it was not established by the constitution it was a recognition of fundamental
[02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:47.120]  human rights and the second amendment is a prohibition of the government's actions
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:54.560]  but of course now we've taken the opposite approach we understand now today we've been taught that
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:57:00.320]  everything is permitted prohibited unless expressly permitted by the government and that applies to
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:05.360]  drugs of any kind of sort it's not just the dea that prohibits everything unless they expressly
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:12.960]  permit it it is also the fda that does that for cancer drugs for other things you have to get
[02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:17.600]  their permission before you can do any of it we've seen some good news that has come out recently
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:22.480]  yesterday we had a story up on info wars dot com where you can watch the historic denver
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:30.240]  fluoridation forum this is the first information session on the issue and it is pressured to infloridation
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:34.880]  in that area nevertheless today we have an article up on info wars so you win some you lose some
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:41.360]  it's a constant battle watch out for this gender bending plastic chemical that isn't bpa so people
[02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:47.760]  become aware of what the problem is with bpa they come to their government they they get it
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:53.520]  prohibited and and unlike gmo's it's not been pushed back at the national or international level
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:58.720]  as they're now doing with the gmo legislation but then they come up with a substitute chemical
[02:57:58.720 --> 02:58:04.400]  and that appears to be every bit as bad and again i want to remind you take a look at this article
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:09.200]  we didn't have time to talk about it a great deal as we've been talking about the fourth video that
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:15.600]  has come out about the planned parenthood stains there was evidence that they are talking about
[02:58:15.600 --> 02:58:23.200]  picking children that were born live and saying yeah that one's intact that is an amazing confession
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:28.080]  and we have an article up on info wars dot com the hacker group that michael thalan talked to
[02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:32.000]  a couple of days ago saying that they had hacked planned parenthood's emails they're now saying
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:37.840]  that this second hack taking down the email site was a setup for donations join us tonight at seven
[02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:46.960]  central akm eastern on the nightly news this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
