[00:58.360 --> 01:04.980]  americans basic freedoms you activate and literally brainwash to quote the
[01:04.980 --> 01:11.320]  for the former attorney general the public through the media to obsess on
[01:11.320 --> 01:19.800]  racial divisions and you fan the flames and rub salt in the wound at the same
[01:19.800 --> 01:25.160]  time you confuse gender identity and set the precedent for government
[01:25.160 --> 01:32.440]  bureaucrats educators and also medical workers to sexualize your children we've
[01:32.440 --> 01:37.280]  got major breaking news on that front today but the story is up on drudge
[01:37.280 --> 01:46.200]  report.com on the right hand side with the graphic white people new MTV show
[01:46.200 --> 01:52.400]  publicly shames white people for what they've done in America and this is a
[01:52.400 --> 01:58.040]  Soviet style truth and reconciliation style show like they had in South
[01:58.040 --> 02:03.520]  Africa I was against apartheid but not the communist system that took it over
[02:03.520 --> 02:08.520]  and now made South Africa even worse from one evil to an even greater evil well
[02:08.520 --> 02:13.880]  it's the same thing here this is pure Soviet truth and reconciliation
[02:13.880 --> 02:19.000]  Commission stuff with a bunch of 15-year-olds crying about their guilt
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.560]  guilt about we've hurt the earth so pay Al Gore carbon tax guilt about how you've
[02:24.560 --> 02:27.520]  heard the black people
[02:27.960 --> 02:33.360]  simply amazing this level of brainwashing we're gonna play the trailer for
[02:33.360 --> 02:39.400]  the show and more but this is Sumner Redstone Viacom through Nickelodeon and
[02:39.400 --> 02:45.320]  MTV sexualizing children number Viacom five six years ago admitted in a
[02:45.320 --> 02:52.040]  corporate press release they were gonna target pre-teens with transgender and
[02:52.040 --> 02:58.360]  homosexual messages pedophilia I mean imagine saying we're gonna target your
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.200]  kids with heterosexual sex messages when they're six years old you'd be like
[03:03.200 --> 03:07.120]  that's pedophilia keep your hands on our kids when Calvin Klein shows you know

[03:12.760 --> 03:20.400]  that but when you target five or six year olds and it's the gay agenda then
[03:20.400 --> 03:27.400]  it's okay to teach them how to do stuff I didn't even know about till I was an
[03:27.400 --> 03:33.000]  adult I mean it is just twilight zone level but because they're able to do
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.160]  this they're not insane they're not whacked out like conservative media
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.560]  calls them like there's some fringe these people run the country and it's not

[03:44.600 --> 03:49.760]  picked something to confuse society and to create another Balkanization and if

[09:39.120 --> 09:44.760]  feels like I'm being discriminated against you kind of get this feeling

[09:54.960 --> 10:04.480]  hosted by an illegal alien I'm Alex Jones I'm your host thank you so much for
[10:04.480 --> 10:11.920]  joining us on the syndicated radio TV transmission new MTV show publicly
[10:11.920 --> 10:20.400]  shames white people for what they've done in America white people documentary
[10:20.400 --> 10:30.440]  hosted by illegal immigrant features young Americans crying over their white
[10:30.440 --> 10:38.560]  privilege MTV will air a show later this month entitled white people which shows
[10:38.560 --> 10:43.560]  young white Americans crying on camera over their white privilege and
[10:43.560 --> 10:49.600]  publicly shaming them this is quoting the show for what they've done in
[10:49.600 --> 10:55.240]  America this is the opposite of the culture Martin Luther King talked about
[10:55.240 --> 11:00.160]  this is where everything is you have guilt because you're white and you're
[11:00.160 --> 11:07.640]  inherently bad pure racism but anyone of color 93% of the world
[11:07.640 --> 11:17.120]  population is a saintly god devoid of criminal activity to the point of media
[11:17.120 --> 11:22.880]  will then not report or is told not to report when things are racially
[11:22.880 --> 11:31.880]  motivated when it is committed by a majority minority and this is all being
[11:31.880 --> 11:42.800]  invoked because the system has to distract the public from the fact that
[11:42.800 --> 11:54.720]  offshore crime cartels private banking cartels are dismantling what's left of
[11:54.720 --> 12:01.000]  free countries across the Western world and deliberately bankrupting cultures
[12:01.000 --> 12:11.240]  and societies no this is not a joke the documentary is hosted by Pulitzer prize
[12:11.240 --> 12:15.800]  winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas who's an illegal alien by the way an
[12:15.800 --> 12:20.360]  illegal immigrant and amnesty activist who has worked for the Washington Post and
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.280]  the Huffington Post see we have a subversive offshore banking cartel that's
[12:25.280 --> 12:30.120]  just playing everyone off against each other and I know that I am stating the
[12:30.120 --> 12:39.120]  obvious here but it's so seditious what's going on the trailer for the show
[12:39.120 --> 12:43.080]  which has been widely criticized by YouTube respondents features white
[12:43.080 --> 12:48.680]  people expressing angst about how they are desperate not to appear racist or
[12:48.680 --> 12:53.040]  offend people so again this is the mental illness they're giving people to be
[12:53.040 --> 12:57.880]  total basket cases oh my god I have a brown bag oh my god I'm white oh my god
[12:57.880 --> 13:02.880]  oh my god I did good on my test scores it's because I'm inherently bad oh my
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.080]  gosh what do I do to prove I'm not bad and they come in and they say we'll tell
[13:07.080 --> 13:11.240]  you what you do you support everything the government says and everything the
[13:11.240 --> 13:16.320]  mainstream media says and you submit culturally day-to-day to whatever the
[13:16.320 --> 13:22.320]  changing directives are you have no opinions no views except what we say and
[13:22.320 --> 13:28.440]  you regurgitate them exactly as we say and then we might say you're an okay
[13:28.440 --> 13:32.120]  person you may have heard of this throughout history before it's called
[13:32.120 --> 13:40.000]  cult programming this is literal brainwashing just like the former
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.400]  attorney general came out years ago addressing the radio television film
[13:47.400 --> 13:53.440]  association and said we need to quote literally brainwash the public every day
[13:53.440 --> 13:59.040]  every minute with anti-gun messages well it's the same thing every day every
[13:59.040 --> 14:03.480]  minute white people are bad white people are evil white people are the problem
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.320]  white people white people white people and this is all being directed and run
[14:07.320 --> 14:13.000]  by a bunch of rich media people that just so happened to be white who want a
[14:13.000 --> 14:20.000]  class war based on race not based on their billions and trillions so they
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.600]  want to invoke class war and race war to bring in totalitarianism as the solution
[14:25.600 --> 14:34.520]  and then securing their ill-gotten gains it's scientifically crafted the
[14:34.520 --> 14:38.280]  trailer for the show which has been widely criticized on YouTube respondents
[14:38.280 --> 14:43.000]  features white people expressing angst about how they are desperate not to appear
[14:43.000 --> 14:50.840]  racist or offend people according to Kimberly Ricci the documentary forces
[14:50.840 --> 14:56.960]  the participants to internalize what they've done in America so you're guilty
[14:56.960 --> 15:04.200]  you're racist your identity your culture your religion your world is not that
[15:04.200 --> 15:11.240]  you're into music or into literature or a medical person or a social worker or a
[15:11.240 --> 15:18.320]  farmer or an artist or a lover of science fiction or a lover of gardening
[15:18.320 --> 15:24.560]  it's all about how you look so that it's never about what you actually stand for
[15:24.560 --> 15:33.320]  this is a new dark age being brought in where you're a heretic if they say you
[15:33.320 --> 15:36.680]  are for any reason you don't want to turn your guns in your racist you don't
[15:36.680 --> 15:40.280]  support Obamacare written by foreign insurance companies you're racist don't

[15:43.640 --> 15:47.520]  in a 250 square foot coffin apartment your anti-earth you want to kill the
[15:47.520 --> 15:51.840]  earth don't want your children taken over by the state with the litmus test of

[15:58.440 --> 16:02.720]  or they like to identify as a boy if they're a girl and do mommy and daddy

[16:14.880 --> 16:20.880]  sexualized with outsiders that have come in and to demand from their parents
[16:20.880 --> 16:27.680]  that they go be with the outsiders to learn the new sexual ways this is give
[16:27.680 --> 16:33.360]  us your kids bring them outside this is hardcore pedophile takeover I mean look
[16:33.360 --> 16:37.680]  at these articles they have troops in the US Army wearing red high heels in
[16:37.680 --> 16:47.000]  public school kids told school kids told to not call themselves boys and girls
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.240]  because that hurts someone's feelings you think this is insanity this is going
[16:52.240 --> 16:56.520]  over the top no no this is the new culture this will be enforced national

[17:03.280 --> 17:07.800]  is not inclusive to transgender and then the elementary kids go what's

[17:59.640 --> 18:04.440]  they could be a transvestite California let's grade schoolers aside gender
[18:04.440 --> 18:09.000]  identity the kids aren't even talking about this the kids it's literally
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.840]  less than 1% of the population but it's being injected with your children and
[18:13.840 --> 18:17.880]  if they can get away with this with your kids they can do anything that's why
[18:17.880 --> 18:22.400]  this was chosen as I said Jocelyn elders 20 something years ago
[18:22.400 --> 18:27.720]  sounded crazy saying take elementary students in turn the lights off show them
[18:27.720 --> 18:32.240]  how to masturbate in school people said that's crazy now that's normal they've
[18:32.240 --> 18:39.040]  moved the Overton window they've conditioned us with our normal C bias

[18:43.400 --> 18:47.720]  shopping for a new wallet mine is falling apart hey did you know there's a
[18:47.720 --> 18:51.680]  company called ID stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic
[18:51.680 --> 18:54.960]  pickpocketing oh I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pick
[18:54.960 --> 18:59.120]  pocketing what is that well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards
[18:59.120 --> 19:03.920]  being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID the transmitter banking
[19:03.920 --> 19:08.360]  information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get one
[19:08.360 --> 19:11.800]  of these readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their credit
[19:11.800 --> 19:15.960]  card numbers and personal information without us knowing it wow that sounds

[31:58.980 --> 32:10.620]  Oh look illustrating how the technotronic systems taking over my
[32:10.620 --> 32:17.380]  phone was off there's something that just started happening and it just turned
[32:17.380 --> 32:25.500]  on a minute ago and forced a federal amber alert over it and at first these
[32:25.500 --> 32:34.860]  amber alerts were missing child missing old lady Alzheimer's patient this is for
[32:34.860 --> 32:44.980]  Alice Texas amber alert 2009 white Dodge Avenger but again all that does is set
[32:44.980 --> 32:48.540]  the precedent that the federal government takes over communications and
[32:48.540 --> 32:53.260]  now they put anti-gun messages over here they put up anti-gun messages on the
[32:53.260 --> 32:58.060]  amber alert billboards they put environmental brainwashing messages up
[32:58.060 --> 33:02.140]  now California says they're gonna come out with license plates that are TV
[33:02.140 --> 33:08.300]  screens that put out government messages and wanted posters but but not to
[33:08.300 --> 33:13.580]  stop criminals I mean they've released 36,000 violent aggravated felon illegal
[33:13.580 --> 33:19.100]  aliens in the last 12 months alone who run around committing crime after crime
[33:19.100 --> 33:24.820]  why not they're above the law and then if Donald Trump dare talk about it the
[33:24.820 --> 33:30.300]  media says why do you say all Hispanics were criminals why do you say they're
[33:30.300 --> 33:34.620]  lazy why do you say they hate them because he didn't say that but they
[33:34.620 --> 33:41.860]  don't care they misrepresent everything why is Alex Jones racist hardball ask
[33:41.860 --> 33:45.900]  and the Washington Post asked and a bunch of other newspapers this week he
[33:45.900 --> 33:50.700]  doesn't like the black president he says martial law is coming and Obama will
[33:50.700 --> 33:56.100]  take the guns in July and August it's a triple lie we never said it was martial
[33:56.100 --> 34:00.300]  law coming in those months we said it was conditioning it has nothing to do
[34:00.300 --> 34:06.220]  with Obama the front man at the end of the day and what color he is and then
[34:06.220 --> 34:10.740]  the triple lie is they don't even show any proof or I say it it they've gone
[34:10.740 --> 34:19.420]  pure evil in fact when I watch CNN or MSNBC now my mouth is hanging up because
[34:19.420 --> 34:28.860]  it is so 1984 I mean it's so over the top but this is what it looks like 21st
[34:28.860 --> 34:35.580]  century hard core the most vicious weaponized media psychiatrist psychologist
[34:35.580 --> 34:42.820]  PR pitch people DARPA brain scientist come can come up with I mean it is hard
[34:42.820 --> 34:48.460]  core imagine 20 years ago if you heard in the future they would make the new
[34:48.460 --> 34:54.020]  army recruits across the board go out in public in uniform wearing red high
[34:54.020 --> 35:02.820]  heels and again it's just to say get on the ground and lick my boots why why
[35:02.820 --> 35:08.020]  the tyrants throughout history make you lick their boots or Satanist make you
[35:08.020 --> 35:14.300]  do something else to the high priest to totally submit it's a family show but I
[35:14.300 --> 35:19.340]  don't want to go into all of it and the next it's kill kids it's all about you
[35:19.340 --> 35:25.100]  will do what you're told and when I say jump you're gonna say yes sir master
[35:25.100 --> 35:32.540]  how high so kids we don't say the word boys and girls anymore imagine the cult
[35:32.540 --> 35:43.220]  other world craziness of that we don't say boys and girls boys and girls are
[35:43.220 --> 35:51.140]  the species in insects in fish in amphibians in mammals boys and girls are
[35:51.140 --> 35:55.980]  the biological life again if I was aliens and taken the planet over and made
[35:55.980 --> 35:58.620]  a deal with the government that they could survive they went along with this
[35:58.620 --> 36:02.580]  I would come in and put chemicals in the water to screw up the hormones and then
[36:02.580 --> 36:07.820]  as the hormone systems kicked in to confuse sexuality I would begin to
[36:07.820 --> 36:13.820]  basically in reproductive activity on the planet to phase out the population
[36:13.820 --> 36:21.100]  without damaging the resources it's a biological neutron bomb I mean this is
[36:21.100 --> 36:27.660]  so evil that's why I say just at an instinctive level it looks alien and I've
[36:27.660 --> 36:30.580]  just got to be honest with you I'm not saying aliens are doing it I'm not
[36:30.580 --> 36:34.980]  saying they're running it I just want to ask everybody at media matters that
[36:34.980 --> 36:38.980]  write disinformation pieces on us every couple days directed by the White House
[36:38.980 --> 36:46.260]  on record I want to ask the White House employees something you know you really
[36:46.260 --> 36:49.780]  did fund ISIS and al Qaeda to run around and kill hundreds of thousands
[36:49.780 --> 36:53.220]  innocent people and destabilize and overthrow countries that were helping
[36:53.220 --> 36:56.940]  Africa the Middle East and that weren't even enemies of the United States you
[36:56.940 --> 37:04.020]  know fluoride in the water really does cause IQ reduction in brain damage and
[37:04.020 --> 37:12.540]  that's even admitted by Harvard you know all of this racial division really is
[37:12.540 --> 37:16.900]  meant to get us all each other's throats and control us and I mean I just want
[37:16.900 --> 37:21.740]  the mid-level minions to realize do you understand you've signed on to pure
[37:21.740 --> 37:29.940]  evil I mean going in and asking six year olds when they go to the doctor how
[37:29.940 --> 37:34.820]  do you sexually orient yourself you don't see how that's cultic you don't see
[37:34.820 --> 37:37.660]  how that's about the state being able to do whatever they want with kids and

[39:58.540 --> 40:03.940]  me say this to the folks up at media matters and at raw story everywhere else
[40:03.940 --> 40:09.020]  you know out there that right the White House line salon all of you because I
[40:09.020 --> 40:12.100]  don't care that you attack me and lie about me people know it's not true it's
[40:12.100 --> 40:19.460]  that I really fear for you at a fundamental level the you do understand
[40:19.460 --> 40:23.220]  that they have death panels you do understand they're putting troops on do
[40:23.220 --> 40:27.740]  not treat list all over the country Joe Biggs has been to the VA more than 20
[40:27.740 --> 40:31.060]  times in Austin big giant facility there's aren't even lines and they just
[40:31.060 --> 40:34.460]  say bring your file back we have to run your paperwork and then just always say
[40:34.460 --> 40:38.380]  bring your file back we have to do your paperwork it goes back to next day bring
[40:38.380 --> 40:41.340]  your file back and they just laugh at him he's on on the list they look at the
[40:41.340 --> 40:45.260]  computer they look back and they go we're not accepting people just get out
[40:45.260 --> 40:52.380]  of here next person walks right up you're accepted because if you're a radio
[40:52.380 --> 40:55.900]  operator nothing is radio operators or if you were in supply they're not really
[40:55.900 --> 41:01.300]  worried about you that much but if you're a combat vet and they've got you in a
[41:01.300 --> 41:04.100]  database that you're not going along with the system you're just not getting
[41:04.100 --> 41:13.500]  treated now it came out that a IBM supercomputer system called Watson there's
[41:13.500 --> 41:15.460]  a whole bunch of these computers there's thousands of them but they're called
[41:15.460 --> 41:21.980]  Watson named after Thomas Watson the number one Nazi of the United States
[41:21.980 --> 41:26.620]  bigger than Henry Ford given the highest level award above awards Hitler was
[41:26.620 --> 41:30.860]  given they had to make a new award for it was a iron cross with four
[41:30.860 --> 41:38.060]  Eagles look it up he invented the machines that they put the
[41:38.060 --> 41:42.220]  Hollerith cards in to decide when to feed you when to kill you what to do and
[41:42.220 --> 41:46.180]  the Nazis could say at Nuremberg we didn't kill anybody the computer said
[41:46.180 --> 41:52.420]  it and they had as many as 5,000 IBM technicians in Germany during World
[41:52.420 --> 41:56.700]  War two Watson reportedly the first few years would sneak in and out of Germany
[41:56.700 --> 42:04.660]  out of Spain just like Henry just like Edward the 8th the King of England would
[42:04.660 --> 42:08.900]  do and I'm not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy the Nazis were just like a
[42:08.900 --> 42:18.140]  test run or a bad son or a spinoff or a mini me Nazi Germany was a mini me
[42:18.140 --> 42:23.020]  about three feet tall compared to an 18 foot devil that's the new world order
[42:23.020 --> 42:29.300]  I mean I mean we're talking you ain't seen nothing the EU was a Nazi program
[42:29.300 --> 42:33.900]  how to put poison in the food genetically engineer it all a Nazi plan to
[42:33.900 --> 42:37.540]  poison the countries they conquered for a few decades then to have national
[42:37.540 --> 42:44.420]  healthcare to process the dead you never even know why you're being killed all
[42:44.420 --> 42:47.940]  you people that are working for the system man don't you know you just signed
[42:47.940 --> 42:57.820]  on it's just stuff so evil you can't even imagine it so now they've got the
[42:57.820 --> 43:04.220]  Watson computers named after the guy who ran the computers that ran the death
[43:04.220 --> 43:12.980]  camps that they put the tattoo numbers in and they're doing it to the vets they
[43:12.980 --> 43:17.380]  never reformed it because it's by design and we sit here and take it why not
[43:17.380 --> 43:23.740]  kill 54 million babies put the troops on don't treat list kill old people Bill
[43:23.740 --> 43:26.420]  Gates already taught the socialists out there hey we can hire 10 teachers that
[43:26.420 --> 43:29.180]  we kill grandma and some of the teachers rubbed their hands together at the
[43:29.180 --> 43:35.180]  meeting when oh yeah I get something if we kill somebody soft weak government
[43:35.180 --> 43:39.700]  employees who've never lived in the real world to a great extent I'm not saying
[43:39.700 --> 43:45.940]  all of them but those groups actually thinking Bill Gates is gonna bring in a
[43:45.940 --> 43:51.380]  system to kill people and then they're gonna get more resources they've decided
[43:51.380 --> 43:56.100]  to scale back humanity to nothing we'd have to keep our numbers the same so you
[43:56.100 --> 44:00.780]  could just live the same level when they reduce numbers it destroys the economy
[44:00.780 --> 44:06.980]  you are going to be destroyed two idiots you have no empathy you're
[44:06.980 --> 44:12.420]  narcissistic you're entitled you're weak-minded and you think this devil
[44:12.420 --> 44:19.100]  system is gonna take care of you so let's get this straight this is not
[44:19.100 --> 44:23.340]  liberal insanity this is not whacked out environmentalist all these
[44:23.340 --> 44:27.780]  conservative terms like it's a joke the Pope's called for world government and
[44:27.780 --> 44:32.500]  carbon taxes and a world government based on wealth redistribution with the
[44:32.500 --> 44:38.820]  bankers tax exempt above it all administering it animal farm on steroids
[44:38.820 --> 44:45.820]  1984 on steroids and they've got the troops wearing red high heels they've

[45:05.220 --> 45:10.740]  greatest wealth the world's ever seen sitting back I mean is the is the Pope
[45:10.740 --> 45:16.140]  calling for its tens of trillions held in the Vatican alone to be distributed to
[45:16.140 --> 45:22.300]  the poor oh no oh no no he just wants you to pay a carbon tax to the ultra rich
[45:22.300 --> 45:28.380]  banks and he goes around with Obama he's gonna come address the Congress here
[45:28.380 --> 45:33.060]  in September they're gonna set up platforms all around the Capitol for

[57:36.540 --> 57:41.620]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest

[58:30.580 --> 58:49.140]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media government
[58:49.140 --> 58:56.740]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[58:56.740 --> 59:03.620]  network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[59:11.380 --> 59:18.020]  oh guess what even the Washington Post has been demonizing us in meds other
[59:18.020 --> 59:23.980]  domestic military training operations with special forces have been public but
[59:23.980 --> 59:28.380]  they're not allowed now to see what's going on with Jade Helm even though
[59:28.380 --> 59:31.220]  they've been told they could and they claim they're scaling it down basically
[59:31.220 --> 59:38.780]  90% from more than 20,000 support trips 10,000 special forces trips they're now
[59:38.780 --> 59:44.100]  scaling it down to 1200 I don't believe any of it Jade Helm is just a larger
[59:44.100 --> 59:48.660]  conditioning process and now it's just become a Psyop to then claim that we
[59:48.660 --> 59:53.540]  said it was imminent martial law and then it doesn't happen and the new thing is
[59:53.540 --> 01:00:00.980]  we're all racist press blackout during domestic troop training must protect
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:06.420]  identity of forces involved that from the enemy but media access granted in the
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:13.140]  past so that's all coming up and then Paul Watson charges at the bottom of the
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:18.700]  hour watch the uncomfortable trailer for MTV's documentary white people that's
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:24.580]  entertainment weekly about white people apologizing for the evil of being white
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:30.100]  I mean total racism imagine a show where black people that haven't done anything
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:35.260]  get up there and apologize for blacks attacking whites and racial crimes that
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:38.820]  are many more times more common than whites doing it and that's just a fact
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:43.380]  but see that's racist to say the fact but see the black person the average
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.900]  black person isn't the blame for what a racist black person does and I'm not to
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:52.580]  blame for what another white person does but the essence of totalitarianism is
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:01:00.300]  many things but in that soup of stench is the guy five doors down shot at one of
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:04.780]  the security forces we're gonna take you all away for reeducation now and rape
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:12.020]  your wife oh someone shot an SS officer we're going to kill 500 people in the
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:16.220]  town we're gonna put them inside a church and light the church on fire and
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:23.020]  shoot with machine guns anybody tries to come out that was what Heinrich what
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:29.300]  was his name no Heinrich Himmler was the head of the SS and the chicken farmer
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:35.180]  and Hitler was obsessed with him because he was royal Heinrich something the
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:39.620]  blonde beast he got assassinated I think it was in Croatia got shot out of the
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.700]  back of the car he was in and that was his thing he'd go around everywhere and
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.820]  and and people started shooting especially in Serbia in places they were
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.220]  shooting all the SS officers because in Serbia they didn't back down with a few
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:54.620]  countries that didn't and there was Reinhard Heinrich the blonde beast yeah
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.980]  and I just love the fact like two weeks after he gone through all these towns
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:02.180]  and killed all these people because they kept shooting at them they killed him see
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:07.660]  your intimidation tactic didn't work jerk and see what they found is but don't
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:18.980]  worry NATO got you back for saving the father of the Clinton Secretary of State
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.780]  Marilyn Albright they bombed Belgrade and killed a bunch of people so I guess
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:26.900]  the Nazis did win but in the end I mean when you first don't succeed try try again
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:32.020]  but these tactics don't works but if they can teach kids when they're five that
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:36.660]  a boy's a girl a girl's a boy saying boys and girls is hurtful so you're now
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:41.100]  purple penguins and have special forces troops wear red high-heeled shoes in
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:47.100]  public and teach six-year-olds that their mommy is bad because she didn't put
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:51.980]  the side of the dress that's in the news today then you're hateful you'll have
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.740]  such screwed up basket cases they won't know how to make a peanut butter and
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:01.260]  jelly sandwich or do the laundry but believe me they will know all about
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:07.620]  being obsessed over their wee wee I mean this is mental illness this is a mass
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:13.300]  mental illness by design and if you're a new listener just tuned in I'm not
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:17.780]  kidding here's the headline school told to call kids purple penguins because
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:22.540]  boys and girls is not inclusive of transgender see being white in and of
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:26.740]  itself is not inclusive you understand if you're straight if you happen to like
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:32.540]  women and you're a man that's not inclusive you must accept you must be
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:37.380]  transabled you must chop your arms and legs off that's where all this goes you
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:42.700]  must be scuttled with a looming deadline for a historic nuclear deal with Iran
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:47.100]  we're learning that it's not just Iran who will benefit from the lifting of an
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:51.780]  arms embargo in order to reduce tensions in the region the US is offering
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:57.020]  billions in arms to ease the Mideast Iran anxiety approving a one point nine
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:01.380]  billion dollar arms sale to Israel billions of dollars in arms contracts to
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:06.020]  the Gulf and pending contracts with Saudi Arabia near four billion dollars
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:10.060]  Gulf states in Israel have said that they wouldn't trust any pact forged to
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:14.780]  curb Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and lifting sanctions would let Iran
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:19.260]  upgrade its outdated military hardware presumably this military equipment is
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:24.220]  needed to fight ISIS oh but I thought we were going to defeat ISIS with better
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:29.540]  ideas not bigger guns well when the military industrial complex is set to
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:33.860]  make bank then it's bombs away will the nuclear deal meet tonight's deadline

[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:07.220]  gonna dish Intel never before released from his perspective he has more on
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:12.500]  what we already know Hillary's up to and it's important you understand the
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:22.820]  personal modus operandi of this literal witch literal coming up with Larry
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:28.260]  Nichols in the third hour and actually come has come out in the news that she
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:33.540]  would go to a weird occult church in California and go in there routinely
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:39.700]  Tony Blair's wife was in major British papers as a witch who helped him become
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:43.900]  possessed by the spirit of light and Tony Blair flops around on the ground
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:49.460]  every morning I'm not joking you this is he's proud of it and is possessed by
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:53.500]  the spirit of the light and then he travels the world like Francois Mitterrand
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:58.260]  did the former French president to be possessed by different spirits Aztec
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:03.780]  temples other areas I mean these are these are these these people are
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:16.340]  crazy okay these people are nuts and it's just really part of the twilight
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.900]  zone landscape with the pope calling for world government global carbon taxes to
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:26.380]  address Congress for the first time ever in any pope in 239 years of U.S.
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:35.580]  history in September world government being announced everywhere here's just
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:40.180]  some of the headlines coming up IMF lowers global growth forecast cites
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:49.740]  U.S. weakness our fault of course and continuing Jade Helm 15 heavily scrutinized
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:54.860]  military exercise to open without media access washed and posed oh it not
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:01.700]  interesting and that's special coming up as I mentioned a new MTV show publicly
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.380]  shames white people for what they've done in America we're gonna break that
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:11.020]  down and tie it in with all of the brainwashing news that we've got to
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:18.660]  cover and then we're going to get into a map of over 200 sanctuary cities in 32
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:24.060]  states and DC it's actually 800 plus but examiner has 200 of them listed where
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:30.420]  you're allowed to commit crimes are then released simply over the top double
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:38.420]  digit premium hike request signal start of Obamacare death spiraled it's already
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.340]  double the last two years now the insurance companies are going and saying
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:46.020]  we want to basically have a double-digit increase yet again because you would cut
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.300]  your prices and was first gonna be free and then cut your prices and then you
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:54.140]  keep your doctor but you know what my memory is racist it's not that foreign
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.780]  insurance companies wrote this with the Republicans to screw us over just like
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:01.700]  TPP it's not that both parties are working together at the top that's not
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:05.740]  why I don't like it it's not that it massively increased my insurance or I
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.500]  just tried to change my insurance and I'm having trouble doing it because of
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:13.500]  Obamacare it's not that it caps my employees at 50 it's not that it we
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:17.940]  might have to lay people off because of it no it's because he's black and I'm
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:25.300]  bad and I when kids are having a party at my house I'll say come on boys and
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:30.340]  girls the ice cream truck just got here so I'll get an ice cream truck to come
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:33.600]  so my kids have a party with a hundred kids we had P. Terry's once with
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.300]  hamburgers and I'll say come on boys and girls see it's my sexism because the
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.380]  word boy or girl is hurtful to transgender they're probably right
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:45.980]  there hearing it's not enough to say come on boys girls and transgendered and
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:55.500]  transabled and those identify as a dog it's because I'm bad and those that tell
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:11:01.620]  me I'm bad they have a moral authority they don't have jobs they don't do
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:07.220]  anything their job is sitting around telling us how we're bad and why there's
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:12.340]  stained glass windows the National Cathedral that show the South surrendering
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:16.540]  and there's a little battle flag there because you know it's like a photograph
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:20.820]  they're now talking about erasing photographs in history books like
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.220]  Stalinist Russia I'm not I'm not kidding that's in the news because kids might
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:31.860]  see a photo of a rebel flag next we can't even have Nazi flags in movies
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:37.380]  sendlers list remove them just seeing the image is bad and then again round
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:41.900]  paper bags we're just just seeing it everywhere this is a black table and I
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:47.300]  put my elbows on it it's a symbol of dominating the black people I'll never
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:54.940]  forget I was taking video class like 20 years ago at Access TV one of the best
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:58.420]  values ever was a couple hundred bucks a couple weeks class and then I knew basic
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:04.700]  stuff and I remember the teacher was Hispanic and he was sitting up there and
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:09.380]  he was going well this is how you desaturate the whites and this is how
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:13.780]  you crush the blacks that's what you're doing on the processor that's the
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:18.820]  technical term he goes he goes but we probably shouldn't say that because his
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.140]  accent was like a Native American accent he goes it's probably not good to say
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:27.340]  the crush the blacks because someone might get their feeling hurt I mean this
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:31.140]  is like total mental illness political correctness I've told you the stories
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.660]  repeatedly where somebody goes let's get Mexican food hey let's go eat yeah
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:39.820]  Mexican I mean hey watch that I'm in Mexico and I was at Barton Springs two
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:48.740]  years ago laying out just swim two miles and I'm sitting there on my elbows and I
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:52.980]  see two Hispanic guys and a white guy right in front of me in the shallow in
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:58.100]  and they're obviously baked out of their brain stone you're like man I'm hungry
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:04.580]  yeah let's go get Chinese food and the guy goes dude you're not supposed to call
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:12.220]  it that it's Asian and sure enough now in yoga classes and stuff where they
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:15.300]  teach some of this other Eastern stuff they go we don't call it the Chinese
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:20.700]  New Year we call it the Lunar New Year and now in Austin when they have big
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:26.060]  billboards big city-run billboards for holidays it's now Lunar New Year what
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:32.260]  now Mexican food the word is racist Chinese food traditional America soul
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:37.500]  food they're now saying no I'm serious don't call it soul food because you know
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.260]  it's not nice to say black people got soul that's just what it's called in the
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:46.460]  south by black people which all it is is a traditional southern food my
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:51.140]  grandmother cooked the exact same thing that black people cook because that's
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:57.260]  the food that was available and it's tasty the point is its mental illness
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:01.980]  projected on us where we don't know reading writing and arithmetic we don't
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:05.140]  know how to do the laundry your kids don't know how to take they just watch
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:16.300]  TV all day and learn how they can wear dresses so we're gonna go over all
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:21.100]  of that with Paul Watson coming up at the bottom of the hour but since I
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:28.740]  mentioned it look this is the new flagellation beat yourself say you're
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:33.300]  horrible talk about mental illness a bunch of crying I was white and I had
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:38.020]  bad feelings and I I such and such and I've never felt and seen such racial
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:41.620]  tension in my entire life and I grew up in Dallas Texas that had a lot of racial
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:48.100]  tension it has just been injected to make everyone uncomfortable so that we're
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:52.500]  all mindlessly fighting with each other or worrying about what the other person
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:57.580]  thinks or or trying to prove that we're not I'll do whatever I'm told media in
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.940]  fact that's what they say in the newscast about this it's like you know
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:08.260]  these kids will do anything not to prove you know not to be racist I'll do
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:13.420]  whatever you say I'll support anything you say I'll Jade Helm let the troops
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:18.420]  train to take on the tea party yes train to take on the veterans yes yes

[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:26.100]  for Chinese women to pour in at record levels to have their babies for free
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:29.620]  because I don't want to be called racist because there's nothing worse and if you
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:36.340]  are now you lose your job you get arrested I mean I mean what are we gonna
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:42.060]  do this race is everywhere it's worse than terrorism al-qaeda was under the
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:46.500]  table please grow up my genitals TSA name all the government runs al-qaeda
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:54.300]  runs the Taliban runs all these major organizations on record this is psych

[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:25.980]  just really I'm just so proud of them and it's just it's a cult I mean I used to
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:31.860]  go to this Methodist church sometimes in Austin Texas because they used to have a
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:35.700]  pretty good preacher back when Bush was in and they were truly anti-war and it
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:39.180]  was classical liberal that guy got retired and then they brought in a
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.900]  husband and wife team to get up there man and it is Bill Gates it controls the
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:47.700]  planet the borders must be open the cross must be taken down I mean it is
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:56.460]  just hard or hard core I mean it is like a Soviet reeducation camp what do you
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.820]  think a reeducation camp is it's TV screens brainwashing you seeing who'll
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:04.940]  side seeing who peer pressure go along it's like a big high school with hazing
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:11.260]  and harassment it's like it's like West Point hazing that just goes on for
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:15.420]  years but it's not seeing if you'll break and do what you're told it's seeing
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:19.020]  who will rat who will be an operative who will be an informant who will turn on
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.820]  their family who will break and who's got to be sent to another base to be
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:29.380]  killed and all of America is a giant reeducation camp so is Europe let's go

[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:55.060]  are a racist I'm trying to be careful here I don't want to thank people they're
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:18:00.700]  attacking me now if I bring up any sort of race issue with my parents they
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:04.980]  immediately assume that I'm a demonizing them
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:13.500]  life be different if you weren't white when you say white what does that mean
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:18.580]  to you we've never had to internalize what white people have done in America
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:24.620]  but here you can't escape that feels like I'm being discriminated against you

[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:12.340]  oh having boys and girls is hateful we have to be asexual now and not use the

[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:25.020]  the stained glass windows out that show the surrender at Gettysburg of the
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:33.060]  southern forces because there's a rebel flag there in the stained glass oh we
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:38.380]  got to dig up Confederate generals out of cemeteries because just them being in

[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:28.500]  illegal and again imagine if I was in Mexico lecturing people on TV about how
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:33.100]  Mexicans are bad and then I could pick some stereotypical examples and sit there
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:37.500]  and lecture and then Mexicans crying I'm bad you're right thank you from America
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:43.180]  telling me I mean it's asinine no one would put up with this or someone from

[01:25:52.740 --> 01:26:00.940]  bad we're sorry I mean I wish this guy would come to me because hey I am like
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:05.900]  Martin Luther King I'm proud of myself I bet you money and Martin Luther King got
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:09.980]  beat up quite a few times by racist white people I bet you money I've been
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:13.660]  attacked by more black people than Martin Luther Kings but attacked by white
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:17.180]  people and the black people that attacked me were just like the white
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:21.220]  people that attacked him they were racist they were scum and they thought it was
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:26.660]  okay to attack me because of my skin color I'm like Martin Luther King this
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:31.020]  guy's a race baiter he's more akin to the other side of the debate and I'm
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:36.340]  sick of it and we've been given this guilt so we'll submit to total tyranny

[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:59.460]  with Gardasil which has now been proven to jack these women up because when they
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:04.140]  attack these innocent people they're attacking me I take it personal I care
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:08.260]  about humanity and I'm sick of you globalists following hardcore psych

[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:41.780]  American leadership they're all involved because what it really is is rich

[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:57.340]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:08.740]  GCN radio network here's the bottom line the general public has been mesmerized
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:14.540]  into a lower lower state of brain function that's on record physical IQs
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:21.340]  are dropping from chemical warfare biological warfare on record they all
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:25.180]  write books how they're killing us it's funny to them they say look how down the
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:29.100]  public is we just wrote a book admitting we're doing it and then they've got us
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:32.860]  all infighting and confused on every level and they're moving forward
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:38.700]  teaching our six-year-olds their racist and teaching them that they're bad if
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:44.500]  they say I'm a boy or a girl that they should identify as a purple penguin and
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:50.460]  this is at medical facilities this is at schools this is at doctors offices this
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:57.540]  is a unified takeover with minions throughout the system taking orders
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:02.260]  because under Obamacare everything's computerized you're given specific
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:06.180]  directives if you take Medicare or Medicaid in any part of your practice
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:11.820]  that you will then read these scripts to the children well the answer is don't
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:19.500]  comply so I'm gonna go over a whole list just today of what's in the news and then
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:25.700]  go to Paul Watson here in just a moment first off if you're not telling friends
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:32.700]  and family about this broadcast you're crazy this show understands what's
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:37.900]  happening this information is not my opinion 99% of the time I rarely
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:43.420]  speculate we have our hand on the pulse our finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:49.060]  we understand the plan we know how to defeat it we have to circumvent the
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:53.420]  whole thing and just come to grips with how evil the globalist are and break
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:57.900]  with their whole system on every front and shake people out of their political
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:00.700]  correctness and that means mainline Republicans that have their own
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:05.580]  political correctness to follow the whole blue blood country club Republican
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:12.460]  racism light we're the elite real white privilege system that's just a whole
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:17.580]  another diversion but that itself is just an edifice that's merged with the
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:21.540]  Democratic Party the Democratic Party is the tip of the spear they're the
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:25.980]  juggernaut they're the Blitzkrieg they're the frontline heavy armor rolling in
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:31.540]  they're there to drive the cultural change towards anti-human measures while
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:35.500]  the Republicans play the part of the opposition so that when you go to them
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:41.860]  you can't ever get real change back towards reality so there's a war on
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:48.980]  reality going on right now there's a war on natural order not be open to other
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:54.460]  people that wish to live differently or have different urges but you must accept
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:35:05.340]  it your existence is bad you must adopt it you must tolerate you must accept you
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:11.820]  must adopt and they pick radical things to make you adopt it has nothing to do
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:16.220]  they sat around in board rooms 40 years ago we even have university documents
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:19.980]  again it's in my film in game 2.0
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:28.340]  it's technically called 1.5 so I was gonna do a 2.0 but never did actually 1.5 and
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:31.700]  they said well how do we do it how do we break down the normal life cycle how do
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:34.860]  we destroy the family we've already gotten the women into work and we now
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:39.420]  make their cultural development about men being a problem we now make them think
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:42.660]  the species will be perfected if there weren't men and that's actually the
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:48.100]  species is men and women together and then we'll go into the asexual mode by
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:52.140]  the 2000s with the kids and then in sexuality saying that any sexual
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:56.580]  preference is hurtful to others until any literature any ideas any information
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:03.900]  any art is hurtful and bad and now scores of what I'd call cooler liberals
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:08.380]  kind of libertarian liberals like Joe Rogan's and Jerry Seinfeld's and just
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:14.380]  you name it most of the top comedians can't tell sex jokes you know Joe tells
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:19.180]  jokes about men he tells jokes about women about straight about gay and he
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:23.860]  gets a bunch of heat about it Seinfeld can't even do mild jokes now no one can
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:27.820]  his daughter came to him as that cue it up I keep saying I'm gonna play it for
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:32.060]  two weeks and have it and it's 14-year-old daughter they go hey let's
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:35.140]  move back to New York from the countryside so you can see more boys and
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:43.500]  have more friends boys is what hateful to say the word boy or girl and and and
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.980]  Seinfeld you don't get it yet I'll be I'm not literally with Paul just remind
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:52.460]  me Seinfeld misinterpreted there's the headline Seinfeld comedians avoid
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:57.740]  performing at politically correct colleges Seinfeld Jerry Seinfeld
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:02.740]  misinterpreted he thought she just has no life experience in his ignorant and is
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:08.060]  doing her version of legitimate political correctness no Jerry you've got
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:12.260]  the older politically correct download that sounded more reasonable to you to
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:18.340]  be you know have a nice society you know the Martin Luther King version you
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:24.220]  got the old download bro get five or six versions up
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:34.140]  purple penguins bro purple penguins learn about them these people are basket
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:39.180]  tastes I mean I've been around quote gay and lesbian people and a lot of people
[01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:42.020]  that are super cool but ones that are politically correct even that are
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:45.700]  libertarian and conservative and they corner you and just keep going I'm gay
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:50.900]  I'm gay I'm gay and it's like I don't care see that's a truly colorblind
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:55.180]  society or whatever no no no no it's just it's a way to be in the center of
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:38:00.020]  attention dominate you and make you obsess over them and somehow you're
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:04.980]  morally not good it's like a spoiled rotten seven-year-old tattling on their
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:09.420]  brother or sister when they haven't done anything it is just a rest of development
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:15.420]  insanity and some of this isn't social engineering when societies aren't
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:21.260]  challenged long-term and I mean prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men to
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:28.300]  quote Victor Hugo think I've flipped it it's adversity makes men prosperity makes
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:33.660]  monsters in Japan the biggest selling thing is adult diapers and of that
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.460]  subsection it was even in Bloomberg it's adults that like to poop on
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:42.300]  themselves and I don't mean to be gross here but Japan had a culture obsessed
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:48.020]  with cleanliness they were the cleanest people in the world and so that's the
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:52.260]  new deviants and they've got a lot of shops and bars that are scatological I
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:56.500]  don't mean to be gross that's just what's going on so see in Japan you rebel
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:01.700]  by being dirty you understand and here we have an elite that have a
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:05.900]  scientific method to all this and they admit it's a plan but at the same time
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:10.060]  they're so disconnected that nothing gets them off anymore so it's not enough
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:15.300]  for them to be perverse now they want to make us in their image that's what any
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:20.340]  God does is it makes its creation and its image well they didn't make us the
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:25.020]  global should make us but they aspire to be gods so now they want to basically
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:30.660]  project their twisted ideologies on to us while claiming their gods and they're
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:33.780]  gonna merge with machines and live forever you people are all gonna kill
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:37.740]  each other you think you're gonna stop all this weirdness once you've got total
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:43.300]  control you'll be given power for one hour and I don't just say that because
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:46.380]  the Bible I've seen it I've said it the world government is going to come in
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:51.580]  they're gonna have the Hollywood the Pope every Protestant leader just they're
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:56.260]  all gonna call for it billions are gonna be killed in giant wars you won't be

[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:02.020]  that literally change your brain God will forgive you you know you get
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:05.300]  injected with this and lose your consciousness your soul still safe but
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:10.180]  if it wasn't for God even the elect would be deceived I mean this is going to
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:14.220]  be the I used to think revelation or whatever was like a hundred years out
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:18.340]  no I'm wrong I've been wrong five years ten years I don't know I mean 20 years I
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:24.380]  don't know and even if God isn't real if you believe that the archetype that
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:29.460]  we've created is gonna destroy the planet this wavelength of evil we see
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:35.460]  unfolding is planet killing every instinct I've got tells me that and I
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:38.940]  want to explain that to folks I want to go to Paul Watson with his breakdown of
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:43.140]  his article that's on drugs report calm and present planet calm that is just
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:46.620]  the latest this is only the beginning the more you submit the more you whip
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:50.540]  yourself the more you prostrate yourself the more you beg the more you
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:54.700]  plead the more you do what they say and please I'll do whatever you say don't
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:59.100]  call me racist the more you do that the more you're going to be beaten down
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:06.020]  by mobs of brainwashed majority minorities who actually believe that
[01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:12.100]  they're doing something good to eradicate the enemy then the whites will
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:18.340]  run to the government become real racist but closeted join with the eugenics
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:22.780]  left and help carry out the extermination of the poor across racial

[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:04.460]  says she says that's sexist isn't that you know it's amazing that they just
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:11.180]  want to use these words that's racist that's sexist that's prejudice they don't
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:18.420]  even talking about does it now now now he's right yes it does at that low level
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:23.220]  that the minions that the young like to use the power words which the system
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:29.020]  rewards but on top of it no she's not saying it because she's just ignorant
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:32.820]  she is ignorantly spouting it she's saying it because that's the programming
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:42.980]  to say girls and boys like each other is bad you understand look at these

[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:51.100]  you're see those of us that have read history or read dystopic novels we know

[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:38.260]  that's in all the public documents and then we go hey Jade Helms should be
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:44.420]  watched shut up racist joining us now I'm gonna skip this network break is Paul
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:49.940]  Joseph Watson Paul you wrote about this for folks that think it isn't real it's
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:54.740]  an entertainment weekly in other places it's a real MTV show with a drill sergeant
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:58.140]  guy from the Philippines who's an illegal alien we already played it
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:02.900]  earlier going okay your wife what do you say for that and even black folks are
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:05.940]  all over the message boards I notice you write about it going this is crazy
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:12.100]  racism because I mean I mean this is are they gonna go too far Paul I mean
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:18.380]  this is so coordinated so mechanized and it's getting weirder by the day Paul
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:23.060]  Joseph Watson well some of those headlines you just read out Alex a
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:29.420]  quite tame in comparison to some of the deep recesses of recesses of mental
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:33.700]  illness that you'll find on places like tumblr and I post some of these on my
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:39.180]  Twitter account I'll give you an example an exchange between a boy and a girl on
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:44.980]  tumblr boy says I'm only attracted to blonde people she responds cool round
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:49.220]  about way of saying you only deem hitlers chosen people as worthy so now
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:54.700]  only being attracted to blonde women is akin to by the way all studies show that
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:58.260]  you're more attracted to people that look like your parents that they're not
[01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:01.860]  sure genetically why black people are attracted to black people white people
[01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:05.780]  the white people and of course back and forth it's just statistically more
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:08.860]  attracted to and by the way black people are attracted to black people look
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:12.740]  like their parents not just black people like big black people are attracted
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:15.620]  they've done genetic tests they're attracted to folks are from the same
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:20.380]  area of Africa versus whites same area of Europe I mean it was just how people
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:25.700]  work but again that's racist Paul yeah and you're a Nazi there's another there's
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:29.660]  a thing called food kin you may have heard of other kin this is people who
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:35.500]  identify as animals like people who are now identifying as women they identify as
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:41.060]  animals there's a blog called little dumpling and it's about an individual
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:48.420]  this is serious this is not a parody no she identifies as a dumpling and is
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:53.780]  triggered by all cis gendered people which means all people who are born as
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:59.780]  the sex they are now people are asserting the right to identify as items of food
[01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:03.380]  and if you don't agree with that if you've got a problem with that if you
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:08.900]  laugh at that you're a racist because now apparently identifying as food is also
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:14.300]  a race this is just examples that's why Facebook two years ago came out with
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:21.740]  50 new sexual orientations to basically flag yourself as yeah there's a girl who
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:28.460]  claims that she's in a coma telling her that she's not in a coma is ableist so
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:31.740]  what this is is this is an introduction of a mental illness virus
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:35.380]  politically into the young people to where they're gonna be just so brain
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:40.540]  fried and on so many psychotropics and so screwed up that they just have
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:45.460]  absolutely no hope of ever even being able to tie their shoe license yeah but
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:49.540]  it's now being given legitimacy and channeled into popular culture and the
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:53.900]  mass media of course it's not as bad as that right now but that's just a
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:58.380]  projection of what it could be like in five ten years so basically this hose
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:03.980]  Antonio Vargas has come out he directed he presents this new MTV show
[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:10.020]  basically to make white people very uncomfortable that was a retweet of a
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:13.660]  review that he did today yeah because they deserve it I mean what a racist
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:16.460]  aggressive statement towards a whole group but notice this is always
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:20.220]  selectively enforced if Bill Clinton wants to rape women in subtle cases
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:24.260]  that's fine if Hillary you know wants to sexually harass female employees it's
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:29.100]  okay because she's a lesbian again they are selectively allowed to do this just
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:34.580]  no one else yeah and then he claims I mean I tweeted out in this which I think
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:40.100]  is the key point here you do realize that in playing white people are
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:46.380]  collectively guilty actually emboldens white supremacists and creates more
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:52.020]  racism that's the effect it has when you collect why the Ford Foundation is
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:57.060]  directing him is to put everyone in groups they couldn't allow the real
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:50:01.140]  liberal movement to have a quality and freedom and come together they want
[01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:06.740]  divide and conquer that's what I'm saying Paul these are ultra fascist and
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:12.700]  outright racist you had salon dot com remember after the Boston bombings they
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:16.980]  said quote Muslims don't need to apologize for the son aides I agree not
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:20.220]  all Muslims should take collective responsibility for the Boston bombings
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:24.620]  but then after the Dylan roof shooting in Charleston they said quote white
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:31.100]  America must answer for the Charleston church massacre so it's only white people
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:36.420]  that have to take mass responsibility and be publicly shamed when crazy
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:42.500]  unstable white individuals act out really this is just a way to get one group
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:47.380]  of white people to totally submit and this whole broken coalition strategy and
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:53.340]  join the trendy Borg and then the others will scurry off and join the white
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:57.980]  supremacist right wing system that's FBI ADL Southern primary law center run and
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:02.300]  then that way everyone just identifies and fights over race all day instead of
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:07.780]  fighting over lower taxes more parental rights more national sovereignty yeah
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:12.060]  it's all about making everyone obsessed with identity politics which is always
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:15.860]  going to be divisive and it's going to ensure that we don't come together as
[01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:21.340]  the species as a people to fight against the true source of tyranny which is
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:25.460]  always the state always the government which is what space aliens would do they
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:29.140]  were taking over covertly which I'm not saying is happening but the state and
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:32.900]  the corporate interests that run in are like space aliens they're diplomatically
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:36.940]  immune their tax exempt they have armored redoubts they have countries and
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:41.260]  sectors the Vatican the city of London within London the district of Columbia
[01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:46.780]  the UN grounds and other facilities that are above the law and exempt and they
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:51.980]  sit there and laugh at all of us while they lead generally traditional lives
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:58.980]  Ted Turner five kids these other globalists five six kids jets armored
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:04.740]  cars huge palaces they're wearing outfits from 300 years ago laughing at us and
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:09.220]  Club of Rome says they're going to exterminate everybody and return agrarian
[01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:15.660]  society for those that they allowed to live with a neo feudalism while they
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:23.220]  are in high-tech command basis I mean that is literally Zardos and it's all
[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:27.900]  justified via this euphemism like with the Starbucks thing which collapsed
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:32.140]  miserably and complete failure with everyone laughing at it oh we need to
[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:36.140]  have a conversation about race but they only want to have a conversation about
[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:40.580]  race when it's about blaming white people inducing white guilt and
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:43.860]  publicly shaming white people you know if we really want to have a
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:48.060]  conversation about race let's draw attention to the fact as we have that
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:52.660]  black people commit over half of homicides despite making up only 13% of
[01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:57.340]  the population does that mean we blame all black people for the fact that
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:02.020]  there's a violent element within the black community no bar MTV gonna make a
[01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:06.580]  show called black people and go and make black people cry on camera and
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:11.060]  publicly shame and say to him 53% of homicides are black people you need to
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:14.980]  apologize they're like well I didn't kill anybody but notice it's MTV I've talked
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:18.620]  to a TV executive and a major rock star who were in the meetings in the early
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:23.300]  90s and they said you better do hip-hop and gangster stuff or we're or you're
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:27.300]  gonna be done they say what do you mean we've been directed by redstone and
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:33.420]  government above them to literally create and and and mainline nothing but
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:38.100]  gangster rap and then you see the black crime rate explode weaponized media to
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:41.580]  teach black youths that you're not a man if you don't go shoot some black
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:46.620]  people mainly blacks are killing and then that's liberal see see what MTV does
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:52.820]  and MTV had music awards a few months ago I saw the clip dice Mark Dyson a
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:57.780]  report where it was black people dancing around with shattered and blown up
[01:53:57.780 --> 01:54:03.980]  police cars I mean I mean it's so obvious how evil these people are that
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:10.580]  run MTV yeah and it's all mega rich white people that's the point this this is
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:13.460]  coming from the top down it's not coming from black people it's coming from
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:17.980]  rich white liberals so again this is about divide and conquer cuz they're not
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:21.820]  liberals they're not liberals they're not liberals I've been around them I
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:26.620]  wish I stuff wasn't off record I could say they are the liberal whites are the
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:30.700]  most real they'll get you a sad start talking obviously hate black people and
[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:34.740]  when you don't join their club they hate you look they know what they're doing
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:39.660]  how bad is it gonna hurt black people when they get a large portion of a
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:43.460]  large minority to start going out and attacking whites 50 times what we've
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:46.900]  seen so far how bad's that gonna hurt the average black person that just wants
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:51.980]  to work hard be successful in being society it's gonna be a complete blood
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:56.460]  bath and as he said you know MTV you'll you go back to the birth of hip hop music
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:55:01.260]  it was all about becoming empowered educated informed getting out of the
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:05.380]  hole that they were in now it's about you know glorified gangbanging as you
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:11.100]  said and it's all being pumped out by Sony by Viacom by MTV by these huge
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:16.100]  corporation owned by rich white liberals but you know should should we
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:22.220]  feel guilty as white people for the slave trade in America no should black
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:26.180]  people feel guilty for the fact that the Barbary slave trade which involved
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:30.820]  over a one million white Christian Europeans who were enslaved in North
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:35.940]  Africa right up until the middle of the 18th century Arab people were slaves
[01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:40.820]  Chinese people were slaves Irish people were slaves that doesn't make the skin
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:45.500]  color collectively responsible no it's the overriding and the destruction of
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:52.540]  history and then just totally invoking all of this and then they you know he's
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:56.420]  out there on Twitter Vargas this director saying oh this is about empathy
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:56:00.780]  it's not about publicly shaming white people while tweeting reviews of his
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:05.140]  show that say it's about making white people feel uncomfortable again that the
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:08.660]  height of hypocrisy that's another thing about these so-called liberals these
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:14.220]  social engineers these low keys is there there to stir up stuff and and and then
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:17.540]  they'll they'll talk out of both sides of their mouth they're so intellectually
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:22.260]  dishonest because they're talking to an audience the average viewer of MTV's now
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:26.700]  about 11 who thinks they're forming an adult opinion this man is praying on
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:30.180]  children you know I now think a modern liberal is basically someone that
[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:35.020]  prays on children I mean that's it these people pray on the uninformed they
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:39.300]  swim in a sea of ignorance they want to make everybody poor and dumb they are
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:44.980]  pathetic maggots funded by the disgusting Ford Foundation that hatched at

[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:30.140]  premiere is 10 minutes long an interview was done this morning by Joe Beggs
[01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:33.660]  dealing with I mean we know it's in the news that the schools do this the
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:36.220]  doctors do it but it actually is happening you know interviewing people
[01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:42.060]  who you go in in Texas with your daughter and your son and they say does
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:45.220]  your mommy let you think you're a boy would you like to be a boy would your
[01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:52.020]  brother like to be a girl I mean this is just so invasive but they're starting
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:56.260]  to force inoculations in California and right after that bill passed now they
[01:59:56.260 --> 02:00:02.180]  got two bills to forcibly inoculate adults the totalitarians are making their
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:08.180]  move the stock markets are plunging this is all unfolding and Paul Watson it
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:15.620]  just never seems to end I guess do another article tomorrow today breaking
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:20.300]  this down but I mean you can go dig up the quotes the universities I know we've
[02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:24.820]  got them in my film in game 1.5 where we had professor Kaufman on he brought all
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:27.860]  these documents but you can find them online where they said they would end the
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:33.620]  family and the plan was finally an asexual brave new world and Huxley gave
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:38.140]  a speech in 62 before he died he wrote brave new world in 32 you wonder how
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:42.100]  that stuff's coming true he gave a speech and he admitted he also wrote
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:46.060]  revisiting brave new world which is nonfiction that this is actually the plan
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:51.620]  and his brother of course ran UNESCO at the UN so I just don't know if the
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:56.500]  public can come to grips this is a scientific takeover Paul other points
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:01:00.460]  you'd like to add I mean if people think this has gotten crazy it's about to get
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:06.860]  10 times crazier because the method is to just make it so bizarre they take us a
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:12.100]  trillion miles into weirdoville even if we go back of 500 billion we're still
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:18.580]  500 billion miles down a rat hole Paul Watson well again this director Jose
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:24.940]  Antonio Vargas an illegal immigrant snuck into the country got an illegal
[02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:29.500]  driver's license when he was 16 if I remember correctly he's all over Twitter
[02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:34.540]  now addressing my article which is on Drudge not addressing me directly even
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:38.860]  though I directly addressed him he's a coward thing yeah he's saying white
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:42.940]  people is not publicly shaming whites that's not the goal goal is to spark
[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:47.660]  constructive conversations yeah we need the headline Paul Vargas caught in lie
[02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:52.340]  MTV producer caught in a huge lie and then show his tweets saying it's about
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:57.540]  calling out white people and demonizing white people and selling racism which is
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:00.340]  always popular look at him for the Klan the Klan fail they became a
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:03.780]  Democrats and that's just the fact and and and then just show his tweets he's a
[02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:09.140]  big fat disgusting maggot sorry go ahead and then you look at all the reviews
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:12.180]  because he's saying oh you got to watch it before you make a judgment all the
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:17.340]  reviews from people who have watched it for example Kristen Yonsu how she
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:21.780]  noted how pleased she is about the fact that quote lots of white people tears
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:27.220]  lie ahead it's always a good time poking fun at white people that's right it's
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:33.420]  fine oh what if it's fun oh imagine if a white said in the LA Times and the
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:38.940]  places she's writing it's always fun to poke fun at blacks these people are
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:45.020]  sick but again again minorities are now the majority in almost every area that's
[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:50.620]  the strategy of the Klan that the Democrats became the dominant group
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:56.260]  of is now to just turn minorities into hardcore racist and I'm not rolling over
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:03:01.100]  to it what about you Paul well then they claim that it's impossible for
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:05.460]  minorities to be racist against white people because of institutionalized
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:11.340]  racism which is commonistic class warfare crap quite a convenient get-out
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:16.500]  clause isn't it Paul I'm gonna let you go to take on this worm and I want to
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:19.740]  challenge this guy to come here to the studio you like to bug his eyes out of
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:23.700]  people and intimidate them all day and act like he's all scary because he's
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:27.700]  Filipino so everybody has to bow down to him because he's the new royalty why
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:32.540]  he's a minority in America and so you got up out of your racist he can go
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:40.020]  straight to hell now get after him Paul get after this scumbags with a looming
[02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:44.380]  deadline for a historic nuclear deal with Iran we're learning that it's not
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:48.860]  just Iran who will benefit from the lifting of an arms embargo in order to
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:54.020]  reduce tensions in the region the US is offering billions in arms to ease the
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:58.540]  Middle East Iran anxiety approving a one point nine billion dollar arms sale to
[02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:02.660]  Israel billions of dollars in arms contracts to the Gulf and pending
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:07.460]  contracts with Saudi Arabia near four billion dollars golf states in Israel
[02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:11.420]  have said that they wouldn't trust any packed forge to curb Iran's pursuit of
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:16.180]  nuclear weapons and lifting sanctions would let Iran upgrade its outdated
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:20.180]  military hardware presumably this military equipment is needed to fight
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:25.940]  ISIS oh but I thought we were going to defeat ISIS with better ideas not bigger
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:30.780]  guns well when the military industrial complex is set to make bank then it's

[02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:17.220]  million people and to control the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the
[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:34.860]  Alex Jones show
[02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:40.780]  female region six in occupied North America you see we have to be super
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:46.140]  radical because the truth is radical the tactic of the globalist is to be so
[02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:52.780]  over the top and so arrogant in their con game that we just get overwhelmed and
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:57.300]  go into learned helplessness and get in a fetal position and go into a catatonic
[02:07:57.300 --> 02:08:01.500]  state globalist can either sell things being real smooth and sounding
[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:06.380]  reasonable but that hasn't worked or they can just be over the top and
[02:08:06.380 --> 02:08:11.700]  escalate everything and hit us with everything to where we can't stop every
[02:08:11.700 --> 02:08:16.220]  missile they fire at us politically the only way to counter that is just to be
[02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:20.380]  completely over the top announcing everything they've done and just
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:25.180]  completely break with them that's why we've been successful because we don't
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:31.260]  mince words in their arrogance they have intimidated us to have the US military
[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:36.540]  now wear high heels and march in public so they understand feminism that means
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:42.220]  put a male culture down as if you're bad well it's a female culture to be able
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:48.500]  to have babies as if differences were bad now teaching mainstream news
[02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:52.940]  elementary school students nationwide to be called purple penguins not boys or
[02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:56.380]  girls because being a boy or a girl could be hurtful to someone that doesn't
[02:08:56.380 --> 02:09:03.260]  identify as a boy or a girl this is a psych warfare strategy to just
[02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:07.220]  balkanize everyone into thousands of fighting groups a tower of babble
[02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:14.500]  strategy the broken coalition strategy and now it's coming out a John Wall
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:19.540]  salon writer what's the matter with white people finding our way in the
[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:23.780]  next America and now they have the MTV show about how white people are
[02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:28.020]  inherently bad and they have people writing articles saying it's always good
[02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:33.980]  to see whites cry and to poke fun at them see the new sport
[02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:40.740]  see I find it offensive to see black people being made fun of if it's being
[02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:44.780]  done because they're black if you're making fun of funny black people because
[02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:49.020]  they're funny people like red fox then it's funny like Rodney Dangerfield's a
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:52.460]  funny white guy it's funny it's not making fun of whites it's making fun of
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:57.220]  that type of white guy like red fox I was just watching him the other morning
[02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:05.980]  it's funny because he's like a real old guy it's like Archie Bunker let's see
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:11.300]  now now only Hollywood is allowed to be politically correct no one else can and
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:19.220]  they expand the political correctness to where no communication is okay where
[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:25.940]  there's secret racism hidden everywhere the truth is the United States doesn't
[02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:30.140]  have that much resources compared except for oil compared to place like Mexico or
[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:38.180]  the continent of Africa but we had more free market more honoring of private
[02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:42.940]  property and we had real Christian values not they were ever fully realized
[02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:46.580]  but compared to other nations they were it was Christianity that moved
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:51.260]  worldwide the last 600 years to ban slavery and it took 400 plus years to
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:55.900]  get it done except for in Arab countries and African countries and some Asian
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:11:01.220]  but it's okay when they do it it's like oh you're a bond servant you know in
[02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:05.060]  Tibet in the cast the lowest levels like slaves in India what liberals is like
[02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:10.540]  but that's their culture that they're slaves they're the untouchable ones it's
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:16.580]  so liberal oh they smoke hookahs the Taliban or or or the the ISIS and then
[02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:20.180]  they mutilate the women and put bags on their head but you're being racist
[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:25.020]  against their culture it's a culture what's bad in America is it is is is
[02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:31.300]  white men I mean it is just crazy so I wanted to ask Larry Nichols the
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:36.820]  consummate Clinton insider ran the campaigns for them for governor they
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:40.220]  got into huge corruption he couldn't be part of it went public the Clinton
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:44.380]  Chronicles you name it Bill Clinton was just recently quoted what was it the
[02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:47.500]  New York Times about what do you worry about in Hillary's campaign Larry
[02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:50.940]  Nichols Larry Nichols Larry Nichols I mean if you don't know who Larry Nichols
[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:55.000]  is it's because yet we weren't paying attention to Clinton politics when we
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.060]  had the nightmare eight years of those people
[02:11:57.060 --> 02:12:03.660]  Jeb Bush I believe is a ringer as much as I like Donald Trump's rhetoric I've
[02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:07.220]  seen him do this before and I know a lot of insiders that say he's a ringer he's
[02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:10.660]  a ringer for Jeb to get more attention from other Republican candidates like
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:15.400]  Rand Paul and even if he doesn't know it I think Trump knows it they got too much
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:19.900]  dirt on him and then the ultimate ringer is Jeb Bush Hillary is yet
[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:24.780]  Bilderberg our only hope is to torpedo her with enough scandals she just came
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:28.300]  out yesterday and said she's never been subpoenaed she's been subpoenaed more
[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:33.220]  than five times I was able to Google Hillary subpoenaed but to do a piece on
[02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:36.100]  that today you could just show all the articles and her own lawyers went that's
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:42.180]  actually not true I mean you know I mean the level of lying but this is
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:47.900]  targeting people eight out of ten in California we've talked to in a poll our
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:55.660]  reporter Mark Dice did didn't know what Independence Day was there it is CNN even
[02:12:55.660 --> 02:13:01.580]  had to admit she's lying Clinton subpoenaed claim undercut by lawyers reply
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:09.700]  now he's gonna drop bizarro bombshells on you but you need to know this and I
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:12.860]  meant to call one of the authors I knew that wrote the book big sis place I've
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:15.780]  seen it was in a California paper that said that you know she monthly would
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:19.860]  fly there to have a shamanistic ritual done but we looked it up it's not a
[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:27.340]  shamanistic ritual it was a a cultic European style juridic ritual you can
[02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:32.260]  pull it up Tony Blair's wife is a witch in fact I meant to tell you guys that's
[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:36.940]  you have more time but just just tie in that just start searching we'll probably
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:40.860]  find it but he dropped the bombshell at the end of the last interview saying
[02:13:40.860 --> 02:13:46.380]  listen you know how weird she is he has it from his sources she's actually a
[02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:50.300]  devil worshiper basically well of course she is who sits around going I came to
[02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:54.660]  Libya I saw he's dead and I was almost shot down in Serbia when it wasn't true
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:58.660]  and just all the evil and all the dead bodies around her and grabbing on all
[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:02.780]  the women and you know dragging them off into her office and witchcraft nail and
[02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:06.420]  clippings the weird world of Sherry Blair yeah you found the independent
[02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:13.260]  Google Tony Blair the spirit of the light and he flops on the ground and foams
[02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:16.380]  and it possesses him each day and then tells him what to do that's been like
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:21.100]  the BBC's like it's so wonderful he's possessed and he flops around maybe he
[02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:27.060]  shoots green pea soup out he goes and gets in underground culverts in Aztec
[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:32.340]  temples and does secret rituals it's so beautiful it's so liberal Francois
[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:38.020]  Mineral had the Loupe pink pyramid built it has 666 pieces and is dedicated to
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:44.500]  Lucifer Google that that's mainstream news but the Hillary ones I know I found
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:49.980]  he has that but the bigger bombshell is the chef the dead chef why was the chef
[02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:56.300]  killed that ties into Obama and then when we expand out we're gonna look at who
[02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:01.340]  is Chelsea's real dad because you know we're gonna risk our lives why not just
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:05.220]  sign John Hancock down at the bottom gigantic people think he was the first
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:09.100]  to sign no he wasn't he signed the biggest because it was a death warrant
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:14.740]  for many Robert Harris Tony Blair's weirder than almost anyone and what
[02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:18.740]  publication is that that's the express okay does that have him flopping on the
[02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:24.900]  ground because that's what the spirit of the light we'll find it but just be
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:28.660]  aware that when we make these claims true stranger than fiction these people
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:32.740]  are insane I mean look at Bohemian Grove I snuck into that Richard Nixon said
[02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:39.820]  was the most GD faggy thing you'd ever seen and it's a bonding experience and
[02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:44.540]  I'm not attacking gay people the point is though this is how they compromise the
[02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:49.180]  Republican leaders you don't get into the leadership unless you go to the grove
[02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:53.700]  and you know what you do get a lot of gang say you got to go rob a liquor
[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:57.220]  store you got to shoot an old lady you got to shoot at a cop or you got a you
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:16:01.300]  know rob or whatever well for the Republican leadership you go to
[02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:05.620]  Bohemian Grove you get naked you party you use drugs you drink alcohol and you
[02:16:05.620 --> 02:16:09.820]  have sexual gay porn stars okay let's go ahead and you know you can have women
[02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:14.580]  too they're just outside at the hotel down the street and the golf course you
[02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:19.220]  want to know where to pick up top hookers in the world female ones I'm told you
[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:22.740]  just go for the two weeks Bohemian Grove to the golf course nearby and the bar
[02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:27.460]  in there and it'll just be lined up you know better than Monte Carlo brothel
[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:31.260]  ladies and gentlemen so you know they're the Republicans most of really don't
[02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:36.300]  want to do it but you know you know John Ronson stuck in with me he and
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:40.980]  we're just I apologize the nickels I'm going to him he didn't want to get in
[02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:43.540]  trouble with the TV production he was doing for World of Wonder and Channel
[02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:46.740]  for an England so he snuck in with me and my cancer then pledged me to never
[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:49.700]  say it then he went on Coast to Coast a.m. and said yeah snuck in with Alex
[02:16:49.700 --> 02:16:52.340]  Jones people said why didn't you say because I have a journalistic thing if
[02:16:52.340 --> 02:16:56.740]  it's off record it's off record and he's my witness I the camera only took
[02:16:56.740 --> 02:17:00.460]  hour-long tapes then the Secret Service is following us I couldn't get video he
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:06.980]  saw it a photo I get Ronson back on as soon as you can a photo of Henry
[02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:11.260]  Kissinger been over in drag and that's so that's whatever maybe he's a point
[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:16.180]  sticking his fingers in his hind end okay let's just let it all out let's just
[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:20.500]  attack on every front with the truth maximum push and I apologize the family
[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:25.220]  audience but you have a right to know what's going on and Richard Nixon
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:30.140]  probably went in there and you know he didn't like it but you know what he did
[02:17:30.140 --> 02:17:36.340]  it skull and bones same deal you wallow in feces and have orgies in huge vats of
[02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:41.420]  feces and that's even in the movie the Good Shepherd produced by Robert De Niro
[02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:45.260]  I'm skipping the network break but no more this week Armand I'm not allowed to
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:49.220]  skip breaks tomorrow and I apologize I'm even skipping plugs I just it's I just
[02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:53.860]  telling everything I can't stand it anymore John Ronson saw it with me it
[02:17:53.860 --> 02:18:02.700]  was horrific okay I mean it's disgusting the king of out of my mind is Larry
[02:18:02.700 --> 02:18:08.540]  Nichols I'm really asking for it brother how you doing I tell you what Alex that
[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:12.740]  little intro there you just described things I don't even want to see in my
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:18.300]  mind Kissinger with his finger up his butt now I'm sorry I'm sorry I apologize
[02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:24.820]  true go ahead well my friend thank you for having me on I promised you last
[02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:31.460]  time that I was here that I would break your news story and so I'm proud to say
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:38.260]  that you're the first it will come out July the 15th in a national inquire
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:43.620]  remember I had gone in the inquire some weeks back and said Chelsea was not
[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:47.700]  Bill's kid and don't forget they hit them with anthrax last time so I wonder
[02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:54.540]  if that will happen again yeah well I'm getting ready but if you will go to July
[02:18:54.540 --> 02:19:01.460]  15th national inquire article you will see that DNA is in the DNA results are
[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:07.540]  in and Chelsea is not Bill Clinton's daughter she's hobbles and you've always
[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:11.580]  said that and she's she's as horrible she's as ugly as he and I don't mean to
[02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:16.860]  be mean but she does look like a toad you know Alex it's hard to fight the
[02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:21.180]  Clintons and I know there are people in your audience and oh how tacky of the
[02:19:21.180 --> 02:19:26.460]  thing to do let me tell you something folks Chelsea is a part of the Clinton
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:32.300]  Cabal she's right in the middle of it Clinton Foundation all of them are
[02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:36.460]  together oh yeah we're gonna be she'll be running for president too so I mean
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:42.620]  she's a she's a she's a like one of the spawn of Medusa we've got exposure the
[02:19:42.620 --> 02:19:48.140]  Alex it's important folks and I beg you all to listen to me I'm one man I'm just
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:54.460]  one and as Alex can tell you the deck is stacked they've got their people who
[02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:59.500]  out a part of the system that they have as you know Alex they control justice
[02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:05.660]  they control Congress they control the media and folks if we're gonna save our
[02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:11.420]  country we're gonna have to find a place to go and Alex I'm so honored I've
[02:20:11.420 --> 02:20:18.020]  talked to some 11 hundred of your followers after our last program they've
[02:20:18.020 --> 02:20:23.980]  literally called and I've actually talked to them and I am impressed I was
[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:29.260]  shocked to be honest Alex I was concerned you know I thought when you take
[02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:33.740]  the 20 somethings 30 somethings 40 somethings and even 50 some odd year
[02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:37.740]  old people they wouldn't remember the Clintons and they have no interest in
[02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:44.260]  all of this and my word Alex there's a young man a black man in Chicago called
[02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:49.700]  me and he's forming up a group he's very excited he listens to you all the time
[02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:55.020]  there's people in Georgia the 20 something crew in Georgia you know Alex
[02:20:55.020 --> 02:21:01.340]  I hate to dump it on you it's not gonna you probably about insurance policy but
[02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:06.860]  you may indeed end up being the last fashion I hope we have of getting the
[02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:10.980]  truth out even when the truth hurts well Larry you're nice to say that and I
[02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:13.780]  kind of get wound up doing this dangerous job and get a little arrogant
[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:17.420]  about the Kissinger thing and I mean nothing against Chelsea Clinton I don't
[02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:20.780]  like messing people's kids plus dangerous but she is a political front
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:24.700]  kind of like the White House or have a have a have a mascot a dog or a cat that
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:28.700]  makes them look more human they've used Chelsea I don't know enough of her being
[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:32.780]  evil to actually attack her so I apologize for calling her toad like but
[02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:35.900]  she does look like Webster Hubble's daughter so so let's talk more about
[02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:40.820]  that and then let's get into your risk in your life yet again let's I mean you're
[02:21:40.820 --> 02:21:45.220]  the big Clinton insider we appreciate you coming on break down why this is
[02:21:45.220 --> 02:21:50.380]  important about the Hubble situation and then let's get into the the cook let's
[02:21:50.380 --> 02:21:56.500]  get into the the witchcraft you're just trying to get me killed aren't I thought
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:22:01.900]  you were my friend let's just go all the way let's do it I know I know well let
[02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:06.660]  me say this the reason the Chelsea information is important is because
[02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:14.620]  folks it's all a lie it is all a lie when I came out years ago and said you
[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:19.860]  know Chelsea wasn't Bill's kid that it was Hubble's I took it on the chin from
[02:22:19.860 --> 02:22:25.100]  ever which way but we have to tell the truth of these people these people are
[02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:30.340]  fixing Alex to take over and run this country this election by the way folks
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:35.140]  is fainting complete they know what they're doing Hillary's running an
[02:22:35.140 --> 02:22:41.700]  exactly like my playbook says run and believe me it's deadly it's accurate and
[02:22:41.700 --> 02:22:47.780]  so what's gonna happen is Jeff Bush for anybody that know when you sit down and
[02:22:47.780 --> 02:22:52.820]  look under our system who one of the things of the Clinton you always control
[02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:58.780]  your opposition that's key that is key to any race so when the Hillary set in
[02:22:58.780 --> 02:23:02.100]  there and her brainiacs and they're going when I what's the only thing out
[02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:07.260]  there that could hurt Hillary well it's the fact that the Clinton dynasty
[02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:11.780]  images out there the name she's been around forever so you see Alex there's
[02:23:11.780 --> 02:23:17.500]  only one person that trumps that who's been around in politics more than the
[02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:25.500]  Clintons the Bushes so Jeff Bush takes that argument off the table she's there
[02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:29.580]  that's right they neutralize each other because the only two choices you have are
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:35.700]  the two new political royal dynasties that are now running head-to-head and
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:39.700]  they give you a fake choice of two dynasties we need an election not a
[02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:45.740]  coronation well we're going to with your permission as we go through this there
[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:50.100]  is a way to whip this and to beat him I should know because I help build the
[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:54.580]  system that's got them here and keeping them here and all we can do just pray
[02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:59.780]  Alex that I do still have a little bit of knowledge of what to do but now I
[02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:05.380]  heard you talking I know people don't know what this about witchcraft once
[02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:13.300]  again years ago years ago I was there folks you understand there's a difference
[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:18.580]  in somebody that saw it or read it somewhere I was there Hillary would go
[02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:22.900]  on the weekend about every fourth fifth weekend she would disappear out to
[02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:27.460]  California finally she came back and say Hillary what on earth is happening in
[02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:31.260]  California she was running with her actors buddies Linda Blackworth
[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:38.460]  Thomasson and that crew and she never told me finally Bill told me that she
[02:24:38.460 --> 02:24:44.660]  went she goes out there to some guy witches church I said you've got to be
[02:24:44.660 --> 02:24:49.760]  kidding me Bill no no he's on all men she does but you got to understand
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:54.140]  Bill and Hillary have an open relationship they don't care they don't
[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:58.380]  care back then you would have called them swingers she did who she wants to he
[02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:03.180]  did who she wants to as long as the two just wasn't each other and then for all
[02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:07.220]  those people that say well what's that got to do with anything hey let me tell
[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:13.460]  you something folks our nation is going to be under judgment by God now we've
[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:19.900]  already opened up the door with the homosexual duct right how many churches
[02:25:19.900 --> 02:25:24.860]  Alex this weekend when it comes time to preach how many preachers are going to
[02:25:24.860 --> 02:25:30.260]  be able to preach the part about the Bible that refers to Sodom they got to
[02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:36.260]  be careful if they do because there'll be hate speech and then you run into well
[02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:41.900]  if they keep talking about Sodomy then what else Alex are we having removed from
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:46.460]  us culturally I mean I don't know well they're now ban the Ten Commandments
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:49.780]  everywhere and pulling it out they're now telling Christians in Oregon you
[02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:53.700]  cannot preach your faith because it's hurtful they're now getting rid of the
[02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:59.260]  free speech by fiat I mean this is serious it is and that's you know
[02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:05.860]  people dog dog you're out is that why the totalitarian left is so arrogant now
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:09.740]  because they know they've got it all fixed all lined up and the real reign of
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:15.060]  terror is about to begin they've got it they know it and they know that
[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:18.540]  everything we need to do just so everybody knows let's just lay it on the
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:23.940]  table let's lay it there at number one who in the hell are you going to call I
[02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:30.220]  remember being in the courtroom David Shippers and I when when Bob Dole Trent
[02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:34.460]  Lock came in and said no matter what Clinton walks this year is it is a
[02:26:34.460 --> 02:26:39.740]  trial for his impeach we already got him impeached just at the Senate trial and I said
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:45.060]  you're crazy as hell shippers that ain't no way they said look you can read it in
[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:48.580]  his own book I don't care if you've got him shooting a woman in the face and
[02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:55.020]  downtown in front of everybody on tape he's walking well we come into that
[02:26:55.020 --> 02:27:00.940]  trial first thing that happens when it comes to the vote we had him we had him
[02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:09.220]  except one person one person Arlen Specter Pennsylvania believe Arlen
[02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:14.860]  Specter comes in and he abstains he abstained he didn't vote when that
[02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:22.540]  happened that threw the vote into a tie which meant then Al Gore got to cast his
[02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:27.820]  vote and when he cast his vote innocent Bill Clinton walked three weeks later
[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:32.620]  maybe four weeks later Arlen Specter's wife gets an appointment by the Clinton
[02:27:32.620 --> 02:27:36.780]  administration to the Parks and Tourism Commission of the United States of
[02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:46.620]  America for $250,000 a year Bill Clinton walked now they control justice
[02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:52.140]  justice now ask trade out he asked all of those people if you will I say well
[02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:58.900]  she obviously destroyed those email they can't do anything about it because you
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:02.900]  know what they got to go to the Justice Department to get the Justice
[02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:08.340]  Department to prosecute since they picked the justice they ain't going to get
[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:14.220]  prosecuted then we're all sitting around wondering what in the hell and you say
[02:28:14.220 --> 02:28:18.660]  well then they're just bulletproof no they're not bulletproof it's just the
[02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:24.260]  system that controls that's right they've taken over that's why and now they
[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:28.900]  want to mop things up and really so the country up stay with us we're on the
[02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:36.900]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[02:28:44.100 --> 02:28:48.860]  terrorists I'm talking about US government sanctioned and subsidized
[02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:54.380]  weapon labs a USA Today investigation revealed over 200 biolabs from New York
[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:59.780]  City to a valley in Montana and over 100 of those biosafety level 3 and level 4
[02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:05.260]  labs half of them have had serious safety violations this is far beyond the
[02:29:05.260 --> 02:29:09.740]  careless shipment of live anthrax by the US military these biolabs are
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:14.420]  weaponizing deadly bacteria what the Pentagon calls select agents making them
[02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:18.900]  more deadly and easier to catch they call it gain of function a house
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:22.660]  oversight committee is asking for details and as one congressman says we've
[02:29:22.660 --> 02:29:27.180]  been lucky but that luck may run out no with the accident rate they've had it's
[02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:31.940]  a mathematical certainty it will the US government bioterror program is yet
[02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:36.460]  another dangerous and deadly federal program that shouldn't even exist for
[02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:42.100]  wars.com I'm David Knight another major health threat this one in Toledo Ohio

[02:30:47.380 --> 02:30:51.460]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:56.140]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably
[02:30:56.140 --> 02:31:00.900]  30-40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we

[02:32:00.100 --> 02:32:09.100]  humor and I apologize for God for it I repent but people either fight or they
[02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:13.960]  flight and when I see all this craziness going on I just get arrogant I get
[02:32:13.960 --> 02:32:20.980]  aggressive in the face of it because quite frankly it's either that or sell
[02:32:20.980 --> 02:32:25.740]  everything I got and flee the country and my family on both sides has been in
[02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:31.900]  Texas since the late 1820s I love America America is the best of times
[02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:36.660]  worst of times but we really are being taken down by a new type of warfare and
[02:32:36.660 --> 02:32:40.620]  I wanted to ask Larry Nichols I went to that whole 10 minute rant before he came
[02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:49.940]  on as he was on hold about the cultural degradation and the the you know really
[02:32:49.940 --> 02:32:54.020]  targeting kids with pedophilia that's what this whole agenda is in the school
[02:32:54.020 --> 02:32:58.460]  sexualizing them saying that we can teach your kids you know that they're a
[02:32:58.460 --> 02:33:03.740]  different sex I mean it's just crazy and then I wonder what comes next I remember
[02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:08.660]  Jocelyn elders their Supreme Court nominee we ought to get those famous
[02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:14.980]  clips of her I haven't aired those in like 18 years and her creepy voice going
[02:33:14.980 --> 02:33:21.860]  in a weird you know general outfit we need to teach the children to masturbate
[02:33:21.860 --> 02:33:27.060]  we need to reach down and help them I mean it's like it's a freak show a
[02:33:27.060 --> 02:33:31.540]  freaky woman I want to talk about our children I mean it's like what is it
[02:33:31.540 --> 02:33:37.740]  your place you crazy woman all of you people and it's just the fact that they
[02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:44.940]  are disturbed I mean I never get sick of enchiladas and cold beer I never get
[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:51.060]  sick of you know just basic things I like I don't get always wanting to get
[02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:55.500]  weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder and then I'm a tolerant person
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:58.780]  so I'm not after people that are into weird stuff as long as you don't hurt
[02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:01.780]  somebody else

[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:17.560]  Don't take for granted. I mean, I took my daughter, there's two of my children are at
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:25.000]  camp, Christian camp. I took my youngest daughter for a hike yesterday and a swim in Martin
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:31.800]  Creek while it's full. Austin's just lush right now. And it wasn't that busy on a Wednesday
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:36.000]  and there's probably 30 people at the particular falls I went to on the weekend. I might be
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:42.740]  a hundred. There's a whole chain of, you know, great swimming holes there in the creek. And
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:49.120]  everyone was staring at me. Basically everyone, old, young, black, white. I probably had out
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:54.800]  of 30 people, 10 come over and shake my hand. And I was out in a rock while she snorkeled
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:39:00.760]  looking at fish out in the middle by the waterfalls. And they would swim over and they were all
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:06.640]  so cool and so nice. But even in Austin, we're obviously have more listeners anywhere else.
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:11.960]  Almost everyone was a listener. And then I've been live video at Big Bend out on the bridge
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:16.920]  and every third person walks by as a listener. More like every, every other person. I mean,
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:22.120]  I'm not bragging. The show really is big. It's an anomaly. It's the blessing of God.
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:27.560]  I'm teleprompter free. I'm very obnoxious because it's real. You try to talk for three hours
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:33.440]  and risking your life. And I don't say that lightly. This I'm surprised I'm still alive,
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:38.080]  but it's the grace of God, the fact that we're so vocal, so support us in four store.com.
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:42.960]  And listen, Larry Nichols is a sweetheart and lost everything he had with his very successful
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:46.080]  businesses when he went up against the Clintons. And he doesn't ask this. He didn't even get
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:50.440]  money from what I was told by the producers and Jeremiah films for being the key guy.
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:54.000]  And they actually killed some people that were in the movie, the Clinton Chronicles and
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:58.120]  one other one. He lost everything he had. He doesn't ask for this instead of calling
[02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:02.120]  him because he's wants to organize people. He talks so much he couldn't come on Monday
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:06.960]  because his voice was going, you don't need to just call him. You need to just write him
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:12.280]  with a donation, whether it's $5 or $100 so that he can live modestly where he lives.
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:17.000]  I know folks that have been to his house interviewing very modest there with his doxon been shot
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:21.120]  at, been attacked. State police have been attacked. People have been killed that he's
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:29.400]  continued. He needs your support. Larry Nichols, 58 Kingston Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:38.280]  and I ever Kingsington. I can't seem to talk today. Larry Nichols, 58 Kingsington Drive,
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:48.440]  Conway, Arkansas, 72034 and that's spelled K E N S I N G T O N Kensington Drive. So Larry
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:41:04.560]  Nichols, 58 Kensington Drive, Conway, Arkansas, 72034 or give them a call 4408970611 or NicholsLiveatAOL.com.
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:09.480]  But that said, I expect if they've ever run me to ground and shut down info wars, which
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:13.120]  believe me, they're trying like a pack of devils to do. We just don't give it attention.
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:16.960]  Because every time we get attacked, we just get blessed. And I didn't used to be this
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:22.440]  much of a preacher. You get in a foxhole, folks. God takes you through so many bad things.
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:27.120]  You just get a closer and closer relationship, plus the discernment you get, the good people
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:31.680]  that come to your aid. I just expect if anybody ever runs me to ground that folks are going
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:35.800]  to help me out as well, because people always say, where are the good people? Where are
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:40.560]  the whistleblowers? We had the deputy head of emergency management in New York City
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:45.160]  on this show to say they were bombs and building seven and they told them get out. They were
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:52.160]  going to blow it up. And two weeks later, he was dead. Okay. I mean, the DC madam dead.
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:56.160]  I can't tell you how many people we've interviewed who they kill, but it's because they didn't
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:01.960]  stay public enough and they had dirt. They didn't drop. So Larry, I'm ranting here, but
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:10.280]  I want you to speak to the evil, the state taken over our kids MSNBC and promo saying
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:14.920]  your kids belong to us. I mean, there's a method of their madness, but aren't these
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:21.040]  also just psycho control freaks that have collected an army of scum? I mean, I have never seen
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:26.600]  such evil. And then the Republican leadership is they're aiding and abetting them. And then
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:31.040]  it just came out yesterday judicial watch that indeed the memos, they were ordered in
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:37.120]  2008 to target Christians, conservatives, veterans groups and put them in jail, which
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:42.480]  they've been doing. I mean, they've now indicted the Texas attorney general that fought to
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:47.080]  keep our power plants on and fought Obamacare and fought gay marriage. And they indicted
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:51.920]  him over a thousand dollar filing fee. He forgot to do once he stopped doing stock trading.
[02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:58.240]  He just let his license, uh, lapse and then still sold some stock. Uh, and then Hillary's
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:04.680]  taking money from third world dictators directly to her foundation and then taking arms import
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:11.360]  bands off, export bands off. I mean, it is just crazy how nakedly criminal they are.
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:17.160]  Who are these people? Alex, number one, what you've been describing
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:24.320]  as part of what we did in 86 is called social engineering. Through social engineering, you
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:34.040]  get the public to adapt. And by that, I mean, if all you hear is what ABC NBC, the news networks,
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:40.000]  all of that, if that's all you hear, and that's what you digest as the truth, then you've
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:45.880]  lost. And I don't care about people that lose Alex. I care about us. The people that are
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:51.420]  saying out here, good God, y'all, if you love your children, if you love your grandchildren,
[02:43:51.420 --> 02:43:56.600]  if you love your dog, whatever, there's got to be something you love so much that as you
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:44:00.840]  see what's going on, you stand up and say, that's it enough.
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:04.040]  Where is your line of the sand? What are you going to put up with? Because the, and you
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:08.360]  said the key here and you're a lot smarter than I am. And you were a big insider. I was
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:11.760]  on a plane. I told the story 50 times, but I don't know if you ever heard me say it flying
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:16.240]  to be on the view first class, they, you know, American Airlines and the head of one of the
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:23.960]  big six banks is on the plane. And he figures out who I am. And he looks at me and he goes,
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:29.200]  you think people are going to adapt and overcome that this our system. He goes, they're going
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:34.840]  to evolve and adapt to submit to it and laughed at me. And I, and you just said that you guys
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:41.000]  were social engineering to make people adapt to submit to the tyranny. Explain that.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:48.600]  Well, what happens? Where do we got it? Actually, it's mine, Tom. It's all about what people
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:56.120]  hear over and over and over again. If that's all you hear, then it becomes so and they
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:02.520]  take over the school. They take, well, that's why all of this stuff with that, whatever
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:10.360]  it is, the school thing, common core, all of that is a systematic way to go after the
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:16.600]  youth, get the youth through the peer pressure organization, you get them to understand and
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:21.560]  believe what you want. And then it happens. It's magic. It just keeps growing and it just
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:27.320]  keeps growing. Then you divide and conquer. Then you go out and you look at all the different
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:32.320]  segments. You look at the blacks, you look at the Mexicans, you look at the homosexuals,
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:39.440]  you look at the hippies, hippies, and you get them all identified as groups and you empower
[02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:45.680]  them. And what you're actually doing, Alex, is you're stripping down the moral Christian
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:51.280]  conservatives in these countries. And guys, I'm not lying to you. We got one more election
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:58.360]  if we get it. And then our days of ever having the ability to change the law or get things
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:02.480]  made right will be gone. Think about it, Alex. And they told us they're going to march in
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:09.840]  and take our kids from us. That's right. Now listen, I'm on an all declaration being honest.
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:16.160]  You know my situation and thank you for talking about it, folks. I've got type $5,000 for some
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:22.040]  health issues and I mean fast. Where's it going to come from? Nowhere. Nowhere. By the
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:26.480]  way, thanks to your people, I did set up a PayPal account. I don't know how it works,
[02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:32.720]  but that's nickelsliveataol.com. But think about what I go through every day. Do y'all
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:41.040]  not think I'm ashamed? Do y'all not think it hurts me to the core? But if I don't do
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:50.640]  it, nobody's going to do it. And if I get quiet, you'll be reading about me somewhere.
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:56.920]  You will. And at this point, death would be a blessing. So if anybody... Well, I know
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:04.440]  your dad died of lung cancer and you hinted at that. How is your health right now? Bad.
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:08.960]  You hear it? That's all I ask. If there's anybody out there, dear God in heaven, right
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:15.760]  now it's an emergency. Call me when this program's over if you can help. But now listen, don't
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:21.480]  let that deter what I say. I have never been on the air raising money because I don't want
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:25.280]  that to... Yeah, no, you didn't do it 20 years ago or 10 years ago with me, but I know you're
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:29.760]  real sick right now. And you know, just thank God that you've lived this long to keep exposing
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:34.800]  the Clintons. And you know, I want to send a crew up to actually interview you so we
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:40.240]  get it all on record and really expose the real Clintons because I don't want to just
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:46.000]  have half measures here. We need a new Clinton Chronicles. We need Jeremiah Films if they're
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:49.400]  still around or somebody to really expose these monsters.
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:56.800]  Alex, what's going to have to happen? And I hate to say it, but folks, there's got to
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:03.080]  be an education campaign. We've got to re-educate people. Hell, I don't even know anymore if
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:08.640]  we have genes in our bodies that are connected to our founding fathers. We've drifted so
[02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:15.440]  far away, but here's what's going to come. You've got two choices right now, two. Believe
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:21.120]  it or not, our best friend's on earth right now are Bill and Hillary. Why? Because Obama
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:27.600]  has his eyes set on turning us into an Islamic caliphate. And at that point, he would become
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:34.680]  the leader of Islam globally. Now, the only people strong enough at this point to stop
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:40.120]  that from happening are the Clintons. And then if the Clintons get in, they weren't fighting
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:45.360]  communists. But I think we stand a better chance trying to fight communism than people
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:49.480]  running around with their hands being cut off because people will go into submission
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:50.480]  instantly.
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:53.560]  You know, I used to hear this about Obama being a closet radical Muslim and I didn't
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:58.200]  believe it, but then his half brothers and cousins are involved funding it in Egypt and
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:03.000]  he overthrows all our allies and puts ISIS in control and then won't let us. I mean,
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  this is crazy.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:11.920]  It is. Now, I want you to think about something, guys. All of you think about it. Obama has
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:16.880]  what he wants. Hillary has what she wants. The problem we have is we've got the best
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:22.160]  government money combined. Just we, the people, don't have the money to buy it anymore. They're
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:27.520]  not even bothering to lie to us anymore. Now they just say stuff. They know it comes out
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:34.400]  untrue. They don't care because they know they have got us down. We are so close, Alex.
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:40.480]  I know. I know. I can feel it. Stay there. Final segment straight ahead, Larry Nichols.
[02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:45.080]  If you're worried about your health and you're tired of the nasty side effects of harsh drugs

[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:47.120]  on your computer? I'm shopping for a new wallet. Mine is falling apart. Hey, did you
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:51.520]  know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:55.840]  pickpocketing? Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[02:50:55.840 --> 02:50:59.760]  What is that? Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have
[02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:05.160]  radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:09.680]  we pay. Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the
[02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:13.880]  city scanning people collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:18.720]  us knowing it. Wow, that sounds scary. Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should
[02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:23.720]  definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet. Are they more expensive? No. In fact, I can
[02:51:23.720 --> 02:51:29.160]  get a shielded leather wallet from ID Stronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded
[02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:33.720]  wallets from other stores. Sounds great. My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let
[02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:37.720]  me pick one out too. I want to be protected and these wallets at ID Stronghold.com look
[02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:42.960]  fantastic. At 30dayfoodsupply.com, two of our top priorities are providing quality food

[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:45.160]  By the way, I have a really bad tendency to get up here and start telling stories and
[02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:49.240]  then not finish them and then go into another one. I was telling a story about how many
[02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:54.760]  listeners there were at the hiking bike trail yesterday and it was just shocking that it
[02:52:54.760 --> 02:53:00.160]  was like almost everybody was like waving at me and people were coming up. A third of
[02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:06.360]  the people at least came up. That paradox, like basically 90% of people are listeners
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:12.600]  in one spot but I get it, they're out there in nature not watching TV. I go to UT and
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:18.480]  almost everybody doesn't even know what the Declaration of Independence Day is. They don't
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:24.800]  even know what the July 4th is. So my point is that those of you that are awake are more
[02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:30.160]  important than I am or Larry Nichols and that's what he keeps getting at. We have to say no
[02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:35.320]  to this. We have to point out this is psychological warfare. This is social engineering. We're
[02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:43.360]  with the guy on record who was the main handler for the Clintons in their first couple of
[02:53:43.360 --> 02:53:51.960]  gubernatorial runs because it was a bi-gubernatorial. This is the guy that Clinton chronicles everything
[02:53:51.960 --> 02:53:59.320]  and they killed hundreds of people in Arkansas alone. Chopped their arms, legs off, thrown
[02:53:59.320 --> 02:54:04.160]  in a dump, they'd rule it a suicide, killed kids that saw the drug flights coming in and
[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:08.920]  I've just interviewed him. I've interviewed CIA officers like Terry Reed who we can't
[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:12.600]  get a hold of, who used to see it going on with the Clintons and he said, I'm not doing
[02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:20.840]  this, cocaine? Same thing Larry Nichols said, you know, just going too far. Tosh Plumling,
[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:27.080]  famous CIA whistleblowers, come on, he's on, when is Plumling on tomorrow? He's on next
[02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:33.240]  Tuesday. So there are good people. It doesn't mean they're perfect but when a rubber meets
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:36.960]  the road they are not truly evil and they'll say no and that's the good news I think Larry
[02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:41.800]  Nichols has been getting at. Things are going to get so bad either way now. We're going
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:49.840]  under judgment that you will be forced to finally say no but Churchill said there are
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:54.440]  times in history when you can easily want to fight against a tyrant but you don't do
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:54:58.240]  it. Then there comes a time where it's still going to be a hard fight and you still don't
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:01.240]  do it but then there comes a time where there's no way you're going to win but you've already
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:05.720]  seen such atrocities and such evil done that it's better to down your feet than a slave.
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:11.440]  Folks let's not go down that road. I and Aitley at a cellular level have to stand up against
[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:15.840]  these people. Believe me, I don't like doing it but it's got to be done. Larry Nichols
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:20.080]  will hold you five minutes in the next hour and we've got a special report of them when
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:24.080]  you take your kid into the doctor, they push you out of the room and say how does your
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:28.400]  child sexually identify and then try to teach your kid that they can be a woman if they're
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:33.240]  a boy or a man if they're a girl. I mean it's just twilight zone how they're training us
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:38.280]  to do whatever they want but we've got two minutes to break. How do we stop the Clintons?
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:44.240]  I mean I guess just bring out all their scandals. Yeah Alex, I'll be on here every week and
[02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:49.600]  every week I'm on here I will bring out another scandal and I'm not talking about BS. I'm
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:54.480]  talking about things that I can prove in a court of law and they know I can't and then
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:56:00.640]  you just educate and you get people to have courage, good, God, courage. That's what we're
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:07.880]  lacking today, courage. And if you'll stand up, if you will stand up, they can't hurt
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:15.520]  you, they can't but if you bow down, this is a game Alex of submission and if you
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:21.160]  have never learned that word you better learn it. Submission is when you give up. I'm having
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:26.480]  to beg for money like some creepy old guy on the side of a curb just because of the urgency
[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:33.360]  of the problem and I hate that with a passion but I swear to God, Alex in the next few weeks
[02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:38.000]  people are going to know the whole truth and I'm going to provide you with evidence and
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:43.040]  documents that people in Congress didn't want to touch. You know why they said, well hell
[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:48.840]  that'll get us hurt. Oh yeah, well great. Now what are you going to do?
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:51.600]  Well and you're also, don't just provide me with it. I'm glad you're giving it to the
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:57.440]  inquirer and others because I don't like to dole out this info. I'm not afraid to die
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:03.760]  but I'm not jumping in front of any trains, you know what I mean. But I tell you, this
[02:57:03.760 --> 02:57:07.600]  is some powerful information. Stay there, we're going to come back and let's just get more
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:11.480]  into the basics of it so that we're covered and then we can get it specifically in the
[02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:16.280]  weeks to come because it's like I told the DC madam, don't try to tell me anything off
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:29.840]  air. She was dead a month later. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today. Alex Jones
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:33.920]  here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:39.680]  I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:43.680]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas
[02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:49.120]  farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans. We have now managed to secure the sought-after
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:56.200]  beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic
[02:57:56.200 --> 02:58:02.360]  coffee at infowarslife.com. This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick me up for hours without
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:06.360]  the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally. Hands down, this
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:11.480]  is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:16.200]  Mexican farmers. Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going
[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:20.600]  to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:25.480]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:51.960]  my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[02:58:55.480 --> 02:59:05.360]  The thing about tyrants is they don't just want to take over. They want to run your life
[02:59:05.360 --> 02:59:11.960]  and they want to pull down good things and build up bad things. They're demons. And for
[02:59:11.960 --> 02:59:17.040]  anybody that's studied history, you know that's true. The problem is Larry Nichols, former
[02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:21.920]  top Clinton insider. What do you do? I don't know if you've seen these Mark Dice videos
[02:59:21.920 --> 02:59:29.160]  that we posted in full wars.com, the drudgereport.com picks up. Let me go out and do similar ones.
[02:59:29.160 --> 02:59:33.760]  We're eight out of 10 people don't even know what independence day is or you go and talk
[02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:38.000]  to liberals and you go, we want to put gun owners in forced labor camps and we want to
[02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:44.200]  kill them and they'll sign the petition to, I mean, these aren't liberals. You're right.
[02:59:44.200 --> 02:59:48.720]  They put them in a group. MSNBC tells them they're empowered. And so now it's like they're
[02:59:48.720 --> 02:59:54.360]  an officer or something in the military and they have spree to core. And all they know
[02:59:54.360 --> 03:00:01.080]  is they hate anything called libertarian or conservative or free. And could you say we
[03:00:01.080 --> 03:00:06.960]  want to put them in a forced labor camp for Obama? We want to put them in a camp and kill
[03:00:06.960 --> 03:00:12.400]  them for Obama and they all sign basically not eight out of 10, nine out of 10. What
[03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:17.400]  do you call people like that? I mean, don't they know they're not going to get free goodies
[03:00:17.400 --> 03:00:24.000]  forever and they're just cannon fodder? No, that's the problem, Alex. So many people
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:29.480]  are getting hooked on the pit of getting something from the government until now. We're at that
[03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:35.800]  crossover point and guys, when they make all the illegal Mexicans be able to vote, there'll
[03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:40.920]  be last election we have, but there is a way to stop it out. Stop it, Alex. You can do
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:47.320]  it. I can't, but you can, but it's going to take taking your audience. I got to do it.
[03:00:47.320 --> 03:00:52.600]  We got to take your audience to the next level and I've got to show you the things that they're
[03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:56.920]  going to do and I'll do it before they do it so that you'll be able to tell your friends
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:01:01.920]  and neighbors, hey, this nutbag said this and then watch it happen. They're going to
[03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:09.000]  lie. Everything they say is a lie. Everything you see on TV is a lie. It's crafted, it's
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:14.960]  well orchestrated, but this system is so big now, Alex, that they control it all unless
[03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:20.240]  it's you and a few programs like yours. So I just want to say this. Before you and I
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:24.840]  hang up, I got to tell you something in confidence. It's not going to get you killed, but I do
[03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:33.840]  have to tell you. And then all I can say is this lady, a kind lady, with listenupaudiobooks.com.
[03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:39.120]  She's trying to get my book, The Genie, and make it. If you want to get in touch with them,
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:43.600]  you can go to that site and they're going to give you something off, but you know, absolutely
[03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:47.480]  you need to find yourself. So it's great. You're trying to do that specifically. What
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:51.360]  are some of the other day? What are some of the other big bombshells you're going to be
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:56.760]  dropping soon next week? You're going to have the actual Secret Service memo. You you're
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:02:01.800]  going to have it about Vince Foster. And it's where the park police notified the White
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:08.400]  House Secret Service. This is the official document. And in it, they tell Scott Carpenter,
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:12.840]  Secret Service official in charge of the White House that night that they found the body of
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:19.480]  Vince Foster in his car in the Fort Marcy parking lot. 38 caliber revolver was in the car with
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:24.600]  him along with a six pack of Bartlett and James. One had already been opened and a briefcase
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:29.120]  in the back. They had nothing in it. And that briefcase, by the way, is the same one three
[03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:36.240]  days later, they ransacked Foster's office, found it again, dumped it upside down, nothing.
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:40.960]  Two days later, they found it again. It's up this time. There was the suicide note.
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:46.760]  Now this is the highest ranking official since Kennedy to die in office. Why did they kill
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:53.240]  him? Cause he broke up with Hillary? Look, as I can't say, and I've said it in me and
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:57.720]  time, I'm saying it loud and clear here. I don't know if they killed him or somebody
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:02.360]  killed him or if he killed himself, but here's what I can prove. Yeah. And any shadow of
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:07.560]  any doubt and folks, I'm the guy that worked with the star investigation. They moved that
[03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:14.760]  body. Now they moved it to get it out of the jurisdiction of the DC police over into the
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:19.600]  parks where it would be under the park police, which as you know, has always been a fixture
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:23.800]  for the government. But that guy's house is going to have that document.
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:29.400]  That's why they keep finding dead pages in the parks because they haul them out and they've
[03:03:29.400 --> 03:03:33.680]  killed them in their offices. We're going to talk again next week or the week after about
[03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:38.720]  Vince Foster specifically with Larry Nichols. Larry, thank you so much. Special report coming
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:39.720]  up.

[03:05:39.800 --> 03:05:45.000]  Friends this is Alex Jones for mitusresources.com. For more than 15 years I have exclusively
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:50.160]  used mitus resources for all my precious metal needs. Whether it's bullion or collectibles
[03:05:50.160 --> 03:05:55.720]  you're looking for, mitus resources is simply the best. I own my gold as a hedge against
[03:05:55.720 --> 03:06:00.680]  inflation. This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and
[03:06:00.680 --> 03:06:06.400]  the Weimar Republic anytime. In these historically dangerous times it makes sense to physically
[03:06:06.400 --> 03:06:10.840]  hold gold and silver. Mitus already has some of the best deals in the industry. But if
[03:06:10.840 --> 03:06:14.400]  you give them a call and mention the radio special they will give you a list of the
[03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:22.520]  days super specials. Mitus brokers are standing by to answer all your questions at 800-686-2237.
[03:06:22.520 --> 03:06:27.720]  They also have a lot of informative free literature explaining the opportunities and risk of holding
[03:06:27.720 --> 03:06:34.600]  precious metals. They are ready to answer your questions at 800-686-2237. Again that's
[03:06:34.600 --> 03:06:40.800]  800-686-2237.
[03:06:40.800 --> 03:06:46.760]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[03:06:46.760 --> 03:06:58.120]  a war on for your mind.
[03:06:58.120 --> 03:07:01.440]  We've only got one minute basically until we go to this powerful Joe Biggs interview
[03:07:01.440 --> 03:07:05.080]  with how they're taking the kids away from the parents when you go to the doctor and
[03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:09.480]  asking them what their sexual orientation is trying to confuse them and jack with them.
[03:07:09.480 --> 03:07:13.920]  And that's in the news. They admit it's going on but just to actually hear about it happening
[03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:19.440]  even in Texas is incredible. Larry Nichols just dropped a bombshell on me where he's
[03:07:19.440 --> 03:07:25.000]  going to vet and get more intel on it. But everybody knows the Clinton chef, executive
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:31.800]  chef was found dead a few weeks ago, former White House chef and let's just say Nichols
[03:07:31.800 --> 03:07:38.640]  has been contacted about it and is investigating it right now. It's very dangerous information.
[03:07:38.640 --> 03:07:44.640]  So Larry, thank you so much. We'll work on this. Work more on that story and then we
[03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:49.000]  will get that information out. It's not fun to mess with this type of stuff but it's what
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:53.760]  we're here to do. Somebody's got to not be a coward and you certainly are it buddy.
[03:07:53.760 --> 03:07:58.280]  So God bless you and get well because he is very ill. He doesn't want me to talk about
[03:07:58.280 --> 03:08:04.960]  it on air but Larry needs your support as well. And so thank you so much, Mr. Nichols.
[03:08:04.960 --> 03:08:06.360]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:08:06.360 --> 03:08:11.360]  Alex, tell him, take that on NicholsLive at aol.com please.
[03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:14.760]  Absolutely. I understand for that medical care of the surgeon. Thank you so much, Larry
[03:08:14.760 --> 03:08:24.120]  Nichols. Here is the report from Joe Beggs detailing exactly the type of culture that
[03:08:24.120 --> 03:08:27.160]  we're talking about and that we're dealing with and this is just the beginning. They
[03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:32.720]  can get away with this. They can get away with anything. Here is the special report
[03:08:32.720 --> 03:08:39.240]  that we posted at infowars.com.
[03:08:39.240 --> 03:08:44.880]  Joe Beggs here with infowars.com. Now just moments ago I had the opportunity to speak
[03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:51.600]  with a very concerned mother, Jessica Bianchi. Now she took her two children, a boy and
[03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:57.440]  a girl. The girl's about eight years old, to the doctor for a normal routine visit.
[03:08:57.440 --> 03:09:02.880]  And some of the questions that were asked of her children were quite concerning. Now
[03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:06.560]  just so a lot of you don't think that I'm pulling your leg, I want to give you a couple
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:15.680]  of references of things that have happened that have been in mainstream news about transgender
[03:09:15.680 --> 03:09:20.360]  roles with children, things like that, the way that our current society is kind of pushing
[03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:26.000]  that on these young children. Now this is an article from Washington Times, Children's
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:33.280]  Hospital opens clinic for transgender children. This is out of Dallas AP and then also we
[03:09:33.280 --> 03:09:40.360]  have out of CBN news, gender identity curriculum, anger's parents in Virginia. So this is something
[03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:46.640]  that is happening in and around our country as we speak right now. And also we have a
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:53.200]  Bloomberg article, California lets grade schoolers decide gender identity. What kind of kid is
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:59.400]  able to make a decision like that? It's such a young age, their minds are still being molded
[03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:05.560]  at this point in time. From national review, school told to call kids purple penguins because
[03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:11.640]  boys and girls is not inclusive to transgender. These are dark times that we are living in
[03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:16.800]  now. The fact that this is the kind of stuff that is being pushed on our children. Now we're
[03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:24.160]  going to go to my interview with Jessica Bianchi and let her tell her side of the story.
[03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:31.360]  Alright, thanks. Now we're going to interview Jessica Bianchi. Now she is a mother who just
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:36.240]  recently took her kids to the doctor. Now Jessica, tell us what happened the other day.
[03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:42.240]  I was taking my two kids in. I have a son Nathan who is six and a daughter Kayla who's
[03:10:42.240 --> 03:10:48.760]  just about to be eight. And this was just kind of a routine and you'll check up. I called
[03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:53.400]  ahead to make sure there was no shot so it wasn't going to be any surprises or anything
[03:10:53.400 --> 03:10:59.240]  like that. And we got there and they started doing the routine things and asking some questions
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:05.040]  like are your kids getting fruits and vegetables every day. And then they started asking some
[03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:12.480]  more kind of alarming questions. One of which was are your children being properly socialized?
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:18.040]  Which of course sent a huge red flag in my mind. We had a family just one county over
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:24.240]  from us who had five of their kids taken away for quote not being properly socialized. So
[03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:30.920]  that wording specifically was like, wait a minute, they've never asked me this before.
[03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:35.880]  And then they also asked things like what kind of extracurricular activities are your
[03:11:35.880 --> 03:11:40.240]  kids in. But to the point where it was like, if you didn't tell them something, it was
[03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:43.440]  like it wasn't the right answer. Like they're like, well, they're in something, right? What
[03:11:43.440 --> 03:11:49.400]  are they in? Oh, what they're in at church? We'll let that count for you. Like they had
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:55.000]  to mark down that the child was involved in something extracurricular or it was negative.
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:12:01.600]  Then they asked me, do you have any guns in your house? So that that was pretty alarming
[03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:07.920]  to me. You know, thinking what what business do you have even knowing that, you know, that's
[03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:14.080]  your right to protect your family if you do have a gun or not. None of their business.
[03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:21.800]  Exactly. Exactly. And and to all these questions were just kind of they they were presented
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:28.400]  in a way that was very much put me in a position where I felt like I was being interrogated.
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:31.680]  Which is not at all what you expect when you go to the doctor. And this is a doctor that
[03:12:31.680 --> 03:12:39.320]  my family has been going to for close to five years now. So I really didn't expect any surprises.
[03:12:39.320 --> 03:12:43.200]  You know, I've been sharing this story with friends just to kind of give them a heads
[03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:47.840]  up. And they've been like, Oh, well, you need a new doctor and this and that. And I said,
[03:12:47.840 --> 03:12:53.400]  well, this is this was our doctor for this long. It's not like we tried a new, you know,
[03:12:53.400 --> 03:12:59.320]  just had a bad experience. And then, you know, they they move on with the exam. And I think,
[03:12:59.320 --> 03:13:02.920]  okay, that's over. This is crazy. I'm going to have to look into this. And my doctor,
[03:13:02.920 --> 03:13:07.560]  my doctor comes in that was the nurse asking us those questions. The doctor comes in and
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:14.760]  you know, does the kind of normal routine checks the kids. And my daughter who remember
[03:13:14.760 --> 03:13:23.760]  she's almost eight now, he asked her, Are you a boy or girl? Wow. Excuse me? Yeah, I
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:31.760]  think I would be asked in my child that I was just I was floored. I just I mean, I I
[03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:36.160]  felt like in shock. It was it was weird because you think of people being in shock and like
[03:13:36.160 --> 03:13:40.880]  car accidents and things like that. But I just sat there like in shock like this cannot
[03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:44.880]  be happening. Like, you know, and then he goes, What about your brother? Is he a boy
[03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:49.920]  or girl? What about your mommy? And she's wearing a dress to the doctor's appointment.
[03:13:49.920 --> 03:13:53.760]  He goes, What about you? Do you wear dresses? What about your brother? Does he ever wear
[03:13:53.760 --> 03:14:01.520]  dresses? Wow. And it's so out of control. And it's all over the news. It's not like
[03:14:01.520 --> 03:14:06.800]  he can even pretend like this is something that he had no idea about. You know, we've
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:11.360]  got these little kids that are for that parents are condoning their choice to be a different
[03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:17.480]  gender. It's like, Would you do that if they said I want to be a unicorn? But we confronted
[03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:21.240]  our doctor on this, my husband did. There's actually like a web portal that you can go
[03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:25.200]  to and put in messages and things like that to communicate with your doctor. And he had
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:29.960]  messaged him saying, you know, my daughter told me that you had asked this question
[03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:34.720]  if she was a boy or girl, I do not think that is appropriate at all. What would ever give
[03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:41.400]  you the idea that that was an okay question? And the doctor's response to this really,
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:48.000]  really just got me upset because his response was, I ask silly questions to build rapport
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:52.120]  with my patients. Yeah, like he asked at the beginning of the doctor's meeting instead
[03:14:52.120 --> 03:14:56.840]  of the end. Well, yeah, well, he asked it, you know, if you're building a report, you're
[03:14:56.840 --> 03:15:00.600]  going to get exactly to the at the beginning of a doctor's office, right? You're going
[03:15:00.600 --> 03:15:04.000]  to build rapport up that way. They don't feel as funny when you're asking them to stick
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:08.880]  out their tongue and put things in their ears and whatnot. But he asked it at dead last
[03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:14.440]  at the very, very end. And it was really bizarre because he asked it almost in a way where
[03:15:14.440 --> 03:15:20.880]  it was like he didn't want to ask it, ask it, but he had to get through it. And after
[03:15:20.880 --> 03:15:24.160]  the fact, he was really reassuring like your kids are good, your kids are good, your kids
[03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:30.760]  are good, you have healthy kids, don't worry about anything. So he, you know, his response
[03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:35.000]  was just, Oh, it was a silly question. I also did speak with the office manager at the doctor's
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:41.200]  office. And her response to me was, we ask all the kids that and I confronted her on
[03:15:41.200 --> 03:15:44.520]  that and I said, no, you don't, we've been there for five years and we've never been
[03:15:44.520 --> 03:15:50.240]  asked that questions before. And I said, is this something new that is a requirement in
[03:15:50.240 --> 03:15:54.640]  your offices? And he said, Oh, I wouldn't know anything about that. I'm not a doctor, but
[03:15:54.640 --> 03:16:00.120]  I'm pretty sure all the doctors asked that question. So I mean, as a parent, it's really
[03:16:00.120 --> 03:16:04.800]  upsetting to not only have an experience like that, but you can't even get to the bottom
[03:16:04.800 --> 03:16:08.760]  of why it's going on because all you're getting is lies left and right.
[03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:14.240]  So yeah, this is probably a new part of the Obamacare. Some of these questions are rolling
[03:16:14.240 --> 03:16:18.080]  out. Some of the typical stuff that they ask veterans as well, do you have guns or not?
[03:16:18.080 --> 03:16:21.720]  And then they come in and, you know, kick them off their healthcare and this and that.
[03:16:21.720 --> 03:16:28.240]  So I mean, it's amazing the way that they're pushing this whole transgender lifestyle, especially
[03:16:28.240 --> 03:16:32.840]  at such a young age now, you know, they have these MTV shows, all these different things.
[03:16:32.840 --> 03:16:37.320]  And it's good to see that you're coming out, you're telling the story and kind of helping
[03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:41.440]  inform a lot of these other parents so they can look for these signs when they go to the
[03:16:41.440 --> 03:16:42.440]  doctor as well.
[03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:49.640]  Yeah, definitely. It's I've the biggest takeaway I've gotten from this, honestly, is just you
[03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:53.640]  never know where this is going to come from. You never know, we're going to have someone
[03:16:53.640 --> 03:16:58.680]  breach your rights as a parent. And so now more than ever, we just have to really be
[03:16:58.680 --> 03:17:04.560]  on on guard and on the look at look out every possible place, even the places that for us
[03:17:04.560 --> 03:17:07.720]  used to be safe havens, which is really scary.
[03:17:07.720 --> 03:17:12.280]  And you're also telling me too that there was another family who homeschooled their children
[03:17:12.280 --> 03:17:14.960]  and they had their kids taken as well, right?
[03:17:14.960 --> 03:17:25.800]  Yeah, some some friends that are homeschoolers, they actually had a friend of theirs.
[03:17:25.800 --> 03:17:30.400]  Pretty much they were dropping off some food at their house. And this this friend from
[03:17:30.400 --> 03:17:35.520]  church nonetheless, who was dropping off food at their house saw that the house was messy,
[03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:39.680]  which of course would be messy moms in the hospital, we know the moms are doing a lot
[03:17:39.680 --> 03:17:45.120]  of the cleaning. So mama's in the hospital and the older kids were keeping, you know,
[03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:49.400]  an eye on the little ones and dad was at work and he was going to be home later that evening.
[03:17:49.400 --> 03:17:54.080]  And that woman just didn't like, you know, that wasn't her idea of what should be happening.
[03:17:54.080 --> 03:18:00.120]  And so instead of going to the parent, she went right to CPS and CPS was able to get
[03:18:00.120 --> 03:18:04.600]  a judge to sign off, sign off on an immediate evacuation of all of those children.
[03:18:04.600 --> 03:18:10.760]  It's amazing the world we live in where people just go in and do these things. I mean, left
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:15.200]  and right, we're seeing homeschoolers being attacked. We're seeing these kids being asked
[03:18:15.200 --> 03:18:19.080]  these crazy questions. And this is just the world that we're living in now. But the best
[03:18:19.080 --> 03:18:24.040]  way best thing that we can do is inform one another and help each other fight this stuff
[03:18:24.040 --> 03:18:28.280]  with information. So I just want to say thank you, Jessica, for taking time out of your
[03:18:28.280 --> 03:18:32.160]  morning to come out here and talk to us and share your story.
[03:18:32.160 --> 03:18:38.400]  Thank you, Joe. I really appreciate it. All right. Have a good day. You too. And we are
[03:18:38.400 --> 03:18:43.360]  live, ladies and gentlemen in overdrive here on the weekday syndicated radio transmission,
[03:18:43.360 --> 03:18:48.600]  normally 11am to 2pm. But we're going to go live until the bottom of the hour today.
[03:18:48.600 --> 03:18:54.560]  So three and a half hours of transmission. Joe Biggs is doing a great job going through
[03:18:54.560 --> 03:19:02.200]  the real Alex Jones Twitter and his Twitter. That way we get these contacts from parents
[03:19:02.200 --> 03:19:07.040]  to humanize what's happening. We showed you the articles where from Virginia to California,
[03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:11.640]  from Texas to Michigan, they're going into five, six, seven year olds and just doing
[03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:17.320]  whole classes on you could be a boy, you could be a girl and your parents can't stop you.
[03:19:17.320 --> 03:19:23.040]  Incredible sexualization, screwing with these kids hardcore. There's always been people
[03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:26.920]  that environmentally or naturally a very low percentage that end up thinking they're the
[03:19:26.920 --> 03:19:31.140]  other sex and whatever, live and let live as an adult, do what you want. This is the
[03:19:31.140 --> 03:19:36.440]  sexualization of children and the UN's pushing to legalize pedophilia. They're trying to
[03:19:36.440 --> 03:19:40.880]  lower the age down to like age 10 or 12 in areas of Europe and saying parents, you can't
[03:19:40.880 --> 03:19:45.880]  stop your 10 year old son or daughter from having sex with some guy at the park. That's
[03:19:45.880 --> 03:19:54.560]  where all this goes. And there is a cold war going on against Christians and against homeschoolers
[03:19:54.560 --> 03:20:01.560]  and others by many of these CPS jurisdictions. That's why CPS has about a 55% national turnover
[03:20:01.560 --> 03:20:06.280]  because good people go to college, be social workers, they get in and they find out it's
[03:20:06.280 --> 03:20:11.560]  horrible. So let's be clear. This is a top down deal. Most social workers that help
[03:20:11.560 --> 03:20:17.720]  old people and stuff that I've run into are really loving caring people. But there are
[03:20:17.720 --> 03:20:22.880]  child predators and others that get into the CPS and then the good people get out because
[03:20:22.880 --> 03:20:28.280]  the predators have taken over and they really are deviant and they want to teach this and
[03:20:28.280 --> 03:20:37.680]  the doctors of course are uncomfortable because I can actually pull up articles where the doctors
[03:20:37.680 --> 03:20:41.920]  are ordered to ask about the guns. That's been going on for 10 years. But under Obamacare
[03:20:41.920 --> 03:20:46.680]  if you take Medicare and Medicaid and of course they shouldn't even be following this. Why
[03:20:46.680 --> 03:20:51.000]  are we following unconstitutional orders? It's an insured servitude to make you follow these
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:54.840]  federal policies. But why do we have Michelle Obama telling our kids what to eat in school
[03:20:54.840 --> 03:20:59.520]  and if school districts remove the food, the feds find them. I mean we're not supposed
[03:20:59.520 --> 03:21:05.280]  to be top down with big sis and big brother telling us what to do. I'm supposed to have
[03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:10.640]  the NSA warrantlessly spying on us. But in many of these jurisdictions that are following
[03:21:10.640 --> 03:21:16.520]  these orders they do indeed ask children about their gender and how they identify to put
[03:21:16.520 --> 03:21:22.920]  it to database. Now they're giving 15 year olds sex changes here in the U.S. with taxpayer
[03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:27.120]  money. They want to make it for 10 year olds. They want to convince your 10 year old to
[03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:32.000]  go have their genitals altered or are going to allow 15 year olds to get state subsidized
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:40.440]  sex change operations. So this is social engineering on a mass scale. It's not a revolution of
[03:21:40.440 --> 03:21:46.440]  people that have been downtrodden getting their new freedoms. It's only empowered revolutions
[03:21:46.440 --> 03:21:55.760]  that end the basic biological code of the species. The University of A&M at College Station
[03:21:55.760 --> 03:22:04.880]  has developed systems to sterilize through the process, different processes during biological
[03:22:04.880 --> 03:22:11.320]  processes to sterilize fire ants to confuse them sexually with pheromones. The gay bomb
[03:22:11.320 --> 03:22:15.360]  was produced by the Pentagon. You can just type in Pentagon produced gay bomb that you
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:21.080]  can spray on men and then it makes them attracted to other men. I mean they are manipulating
[03:22:21.080 --> 03:22:28.760]  our biology. Upwards of half the amphibians are now bisexual. Just from the chemicals
[03:22:28.760 --> 03:22:34.200]  that are running off. This is just a fact. And then as the change starts, as we're being
[03:22:34.200 --> 03:22:42.680]  killed, as we're being euthanized genetically, as we're being put to sleep genetically, sexually,
[03:22:42.680 --> 03:22:47.440]  they then say, oh everyone suddenly doesn't know what sex they are. Be nice, be friendly
[03:22:47.440 --> 03:22:52.400]  and we're like, oh okay, sure. You can live your own life. I'm not obsessed with it. Oh
[03:22:52.400 --> 03:22:56.880]  really? You're going to pay for people to have sex changes. Oh well, government's too
[03:22:56.880 --> 03:23:03.200]  big. I mean, can I pay for somebody that wants to have their nose job too? Or a facelift?
[03:23:03.200 --> 03:23:07.640]  And then next it's, oh we're going to teach your kids to be tolerant. All right. Yeah,
[03:23:07.640 --> 03:23:13.360]  we're going to tell your six-year-old how to put a condom on a banana. It's about a
[03:23:13.360 --> 03:23:20.600]  power grab. Plain and simple. So we're going to get this lady on. Great job, Joe Biggs.
[03:23:20.600 --> 03:23:26.040]  Send us your comments, your stories, any documentation, the information you have to
[03:23:26.040 --> 03:23:31.760]  Real Alex Jones on Twitter. Also at Rambo Biggs on Twitter. And to the other great reporters
[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:37.480]  like Jacarie Jackson and Leigh Ann McAdoo and so many others. David Knight, Darren McBreen
[03:23:37.480 --> 03:23:41.880]  others so they can follow up the story and get more and more of these breaking news stories
[03:23:41.880 --> 03:23:45.920]  out outside of the syndicated radio show in the nightly news because stuff's moving too
[03:23:45.920 --> 03:23:53.760]  fast and in closing, that's why it's not imperative. It's essential that you don't take this broadcast
[03:23:53.760 --> 03:23:57.400]  for granted that I don't either. That's why you see me shoot reports at night or come
[03:23:57.400 --> 03:24:01.680]  in on Saturdays and I do reports that go on info wars.com. It's because I'm like, whoa,
[03:24:01.680 --> 03:24:05.440]  this is too important. I need to not just sit there like a frog in the pot and boiling.
[03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:11.080]  I need to respond. And so I need to hire a couple more reporters, a couple more videographers,
[03:24:11.080 --> 03:24:16.080]  editors. We need more equipment. We need to be able to send people around the country.
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:22.560]  We need to be able to make more films and we can't do that without your support. So
[03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:26.960]  spreading the word wakes people up. They also become listeners and support our sponsors
[03:24:26.960 --> 03:24:32.000]  and by our products we fund the operation with. And it's all the best water holders,
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:36.840]  the lowest price that you need with what's in the water table, the glyphosates, the fluoride,
[03:24:36.840 --> 03:24:41.720]  the chemicals, the dead bacteria, the living bacteria. It's non GMO high quality seeds
[03:24:41.720 --> 03:24:46.360]  at the lowest prices. I went out and made deals with the biggest producers to bring
[03:24:46.360 --> 03:24:52.760]  in the widest selection at the lowest price. These are great deals, books, videos, t-shirts,
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:57.640]  free shipping in the month of July. All of this makes what we're doing possible and I'm
[03:24:57.640 --> 03:25:03.240]  going up against some powerfully rich enemies who are a lot bigger than us. But you know
[03:25:03.240 --> 03:25:07.480]  what? We've got a sling. We've got a rock. We've got the truth. We've got the will. We've
[03:25:07.480 --> 03:25:13.400]  got what it takes. I mean, I know how to just, my daughter threw her goggles up in a tree
[03:25:13.400 --> 03:25:18.800]  a few weeks ago when we were going back down just playing to the green belt and she threw
[03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:25.920]  them way up the top of the tree and I just had a bottle of water in my hand and it was
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:29.520]  just way up in the tree, probably 30 feet up the tree because it was goggles. She could
[03:25:29.520 --> 03:25:33.280]  just swing them up really high and I just said, watch this, boom, didn't think through
[03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:38.800]  it, knocked it perfectly out up under it, making it come down. And when I with a gun
[03:25:38.800 --> 03:25:43.120]  or a rock, I was a kid with squirrels, I could just kill squirrels and rabbits all day and
[03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:47.100]  take them home and actually cook them as if I killed something. I had to eat it and other
[03:25:47.100 --> 03:25:53.560]  kids couldn't do that because I could just flip a switch and do it. And anytime I hesitate,
[03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:56.840]  I can't do it. I don't want to say use the force, but it basically is getting in the
[03:25:56.840 --> 03:26:04.560]  zone. We can politically folks take action and have the will. Our enemies have will
[03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:09.520]  and they're overrunning us and pissing on us basically. I mean, they are rubbing our
[03:26:09.520 --> 03:26:14.760]  face in it. They are dominating us. Melissa Harris Perry says your kids belong to us.
[03:26:14.760 --> 03:26:18.720]  They're taking kids age 11 because their parents are an hour late and they get home at six
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:22.960]  and they play basketball in the backyard because the kid can't find the spare key. That happened
[03:26:22.960 --> 03:26:27.560]  to me many times that somebody didn't put the spare key back and I was locked out and
[03:26:27.560 --> 03:26:32.760]  the neighbors would invite me over for coffee or whatever for a soda. I mean, I would stay
[03:26:32.760 --> 03:26:36.880]  up till 10 at night during the summer running around when I was eight years old. I would
[03:26:36.880 --> 03:26:42.840]  go camp out when I was 10 years old, you know, in the woods by the park. And you know, the
[03:26:42.840 --> 03:26:46.880]  cops would drive by and say, and they knew it was kids camping. And I grew up on the
[03:26:46.880 --> 03:26:53.320]  edge of Dallas. I mean, we are so domesticated. We are so pathetic. And it's just the beginning
[03:26:53.320 --> 03:26:58.840]  of the end of humanity as we're absorbed into computers. Our IQ is dropped. We can't communicate.
[03:26:58.840 --> 03:27:04.520]  We lose our association with others. There's a sickness on the people and I want to break
[03:27:04.520 --> 03:27:08.400]  it. I want to stop it. I don't want to go into this, but you've got to recognize how
[03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:13.080]  bad it is. All of you that serve the evil. You think you're part of the system. You're
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:18.600]  not. You're being destroyed. You're losing your humanity too. This is real. They put
[03:27:18.600 --> 03:27:23.600]  gender benders in the damn water. Here's Melissa Harris Perry with her cult look in her eyes
[03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:27.360]  that sounds good. It takes a village. Yeah, but don't have your neighbors actually spank
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:31.680]  your kid or actually take you home. No, call the police on them. That's their new village.
[03:27:31.680 --> 03:27:35.600]  Everything is twisted. Here it is. We haven't had a very collective notion of these are
[03:27:35.600 --> 03:27:39.520]  our children. So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that
[03:27:39.520 --> 03:27:43.400]  kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids
[03:27:43.400 --> 03:27:48.520]  belong to whole communities. Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households,
[03:27:48.520 --> 03:27:52.280]  then we start making better investments. Yeah, they used to call it mind your own business
[03:27:52.280 --> 03:27:57.440]  and an adult's talking to your seven year old about sex. They called it pedo behavior.
[03:27:57.440 --> 03:28:01.800]  But what it is is that I mean, when I went and had my kids every time at our major hospital
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:04.960]  that is the doctor, they came in and said, sir, we take this file downstairs. And as
[03:28:04.960 --> 03:28:08.400]  soon as I left, they asked my wife if I beat her or we had enough money to put it in the
[03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:11.960]  file to take the kids. They don't tell women if you got any marijuana in your system, they're
[03:28:11.960 --> 03:28:18.960]  going to take your kid from all these federalized bureaucracies are there to prey on you. Get
[03:28:18.960 --> 03:28:24.000]  that through your head. Make no mistake. And it's all sold for a greater good. So the minions
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:40.040]  think they're doing good. No, it's not for a greater good.
