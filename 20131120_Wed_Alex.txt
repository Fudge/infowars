[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  John F. Kennedy the private run-for-profit offshore banking cartel known as the
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  Federal Reserve eight o'clock Pearl Street in downtown Dallas so get there

[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  Dallas area to to to come and to get these flyers I'll give people a hundred
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  flyers a piece I'll give you big posters that have been posterized you name it so
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  you can come down Thursday or Friday whatever day you can and hold up the
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  signs exposing that there's not just the assassination of JFK being an
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  establishment coup d'etat against the Republic but the attack on free speech
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  signifies the fact that they're trying to say you know no one who disagrees the
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  official story inside Dealey Plaza now they're saying nowhere within you know
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  five blocks of it the mayor's had to back off some but we're there to show him
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  the First Amendment is alive and well and I will announce by the end of the
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  broadcast today I'm just going to make some final planning where we're going to
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  rally for the First Amendment tomorrow at five o'clock to give you a chance for
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  it gets dark so it's early enough it won't be dark till 6 30 but it's it's
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  still kind of hard for folks to get down there after work but you can leave work
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  early meet us we're going to pick someplace in downtown Dallas have a rally
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  tomorrow we're going to march down to the barricades that are going up right now
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  at Dealey Plaza we have John Bowne and Rob Jacobson there on the ground and
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  they're going to be doing some live view streams today we're going to dial into
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  just like you already did from the NSA and more so continued coverage of this
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  situation it's just like communist China in 1989 Americans marveled what you can't
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  politically gather in the giant Tiananmen Square for democracy and then tanks
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  came and killed everybody I mean if you resist the police when they say no free
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  speech they'll kill you as well or at least they'll try if we let it get to
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  this point and most police by the way that I've run into around the country
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  support the First Amendment and are upset about what's happening but the feds
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  are trying to train them and condition them to go along with this speaking of
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  that you saw it in Georgia you saw it in Alabama you saw it in Florida this year
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  and it was a federal grant then we saw it in Arizona Colorado and California
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  then Oregon now it's happening in Texas and they're actually telling people
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  you've got to give blood and saliva they call it a survey but they direct you
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  it's a literal false arrest commandeering hijacking just like the TSA sticking their
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  hands down your pants is illegal and they direct you off the checkpoint that
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  is that is a custodial arrest that is under common law arrest and if it's false
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  it's a felony the police tried to lie about it first till video came out now
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  they're freaking out apologizing say it was federal orders to and they're doing
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  this as a beta test to get the cops ready to just direct people off and then
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  demand blood and saliva and they took it and the media tries to spin it in
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  Florida areas well it's no big deal I mean you know it's for your safety we
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  don't make you take it no they make you they say we're here taking blood and
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  saliva and most people in land of the free home of the brave North Korea in
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  North America literally begin urinating on themselves and groveling and
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  rolling around in fetal positions to the police and then they give the blood and
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  everything boy let me tell you I mean I've just about had enough and of course
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  they have federal funding for proctology exams on the side of the road and I say
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  that it sounds like a lie but it's true I mean it's just like it's the feds
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  training police to go inside your body without warrants I mean the government
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  is mad dog nuts it's got a name it's called tyranny with a capital T as in

[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  demonstration in front of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve at eight
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  o'clock central until nine central and it's also a public Liberty First
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  Amendment emergency meeting where we're going to hand out a whole bunch of
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  flyers it's actually 30,000 now I've gotten 30,000 flyers we need about 300
[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  people at least to show up so I give 100 flyers to each person to hand out
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  Thursday and Friday and it's about JFK the two-sided flyers but it's also
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  about the attack on the First Amendment really powerful flyers and 200 big
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  posters that we've also printed up and put on phone board for you so that you
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  can really dominate the establishment and show them what people power in the
[10:03.000 --> 10:10.000]  Info War can do how real demonstrations to take over political events the Ford
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  Foundation runs all the fake leftist groups they have them dressing clown
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  outfits on record this has all been declassified to discredit everyone
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  they'll have them you know so they're going to levitate the mint at a DNC
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  demonstration and dress up in wizard outfits to look ridiculous to look
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  mindless and then the media will just cover that and make fun of them instead
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  of taking over events and showing how they're trying to take over Dallas in
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  an attack on the First Amendment with 5,000 select people allowed in we're
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  just going to use the fact that they've done that as a judo move to make it
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  literally boomerang around and politically throw them through the wall
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  they're attacking our free speech I wouldn't even have gone to this folks if
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  they weren't trying to ban free speech but because they're doing it I'm coming
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  and I'm coming with as many people as I can get and I'm so busy covering other
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  news so busy covering other issues that I really haven't talked about this a lot
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  in the last month and I should have built it up and built it up we could have
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  50,000 people there but that's okay the few the proud the patriots will be there
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  and I would expect thousands of listeners will come out for the 50th on Friday
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.000]  in Dallas to just speak out have your own homemade signs get our signs whatever
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.000]  I imagine that hundreds are going to show up tomorrow and hundreds tonight
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  and by showing up today and tomorrow we will dominate pre coverage in fact I
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  called Richard this morning he's already up there as well I forgot that when I got
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  him on the phone I forgot why I called him because he brought up a bunch of other
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  issues to me call him and tell him the two local stations he knows the ones that
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  are great folks that are always begging me to come on but I'm too busy to go on
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  one of them is that business talk station with a huge listenership and the other
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  one is that other talk station they both wanted me on just a few weeks ago and I
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  was too busy Richard knows them because that's who they contact for some reason
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.000]  I want you to call Richard and get me set up today and tomorrow I don't care
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  about Friday but then there'll be over saturation it won't do anything I need to
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  get on those Dallas stations right now so I'm kind of war gaming this on air
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  right now as your radio talk show host as a documentary filmmaker as the head of
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.000]  the nightly news as a patriot leader I am here basically getting ready to
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  deploy our operation folks into the area in defense of the First Amendment and
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  the Republic and we are going to again put our most of our team of reporters
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.000]  writers TV reporters journalists researchers are all going to be there
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  from Darren McBrain to Leanne McAdoo to John Bown to so many others Kit Daniels
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  is going up there and again I'm going to be there this is going to be a very
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  very important event and we are going to be defending the First Amendment let me
[13:00.000 --> 13:07.000]  just put it to you that way it should be a very interesting next 48 plus hours
[13:07.000 --> 13:13.000]  going into Friday and at 1230 central they have the moment of silence when
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  they executed JFK at high noon in front of the whole world as a message to the
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  Russians and a message everybody else will do whatever we want and the world
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  began shaking and groveling in fear to the global mafia that had seized control
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  of America a Don Salazar wrote an article about this yesterday with some of the
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  plans will have another article out today by Paul Watson with all the details
[13:35.000 --> 13:43.000]  the live feeds all of it it'll be live JFK 50th coverage you know or it'll be
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  JFK 50th coverage First Amendment defense page basically is what we're going to
[13:48.000 --> 13:56.000]  call it and it's going to be historic so be part of it but the key is that we
[13:56.000 --> 14:03.000]  need the real special forces of the First Amendment to show up tonight when
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  the when the when the bat signal has been fired out with less than 48 hours
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  notice I need you to show up at Pearl Street at the Federal Reserve we've had
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  three rallies there before as many as a thousand people out at one of them with
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  just a few days planning and we've gone and demonstrated against the Fed there
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  many times of course Ron Paul's demonstrated there as well and in
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  Houston and so have we with Ron Paul so it's key that we explain to the real
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  shadow government is that thinks it's above the law and thinks that it
[14:32.000 --> 14:40.000]  controls the power of the purse I get so excited I stopped breathing on air I
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  was reading about screen apnea or typing apnea was in the Daily Mail yesterday
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  or when people type or people are reading they'll stop breathing and I do that
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  all the time I'll go like a minute sometimes on air and watch video of my
[14:54.000 --> 15:00.000]  head turning red as I just like a machine stream out the communications I've
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  never had voice lessons never had acting lessons ever had breathing lessons
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  that's not true I took a few acting lessons and I took drama for one semester
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  in high school and then I guess some friends talked me into some acting
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  lessons in college and all they tried to do was induct me into pornography so
[15:19.000 --> 15:25.000]  I didn't I didn't finish the classes so I forgot about that they were there at
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  the whole class if you weren't you know as ugly as the side of a barn door they
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  would try to get you into pornography and that's why everybody that goes to
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  Hollywood trying to get into trying to get into movies ends up in pornography
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  because that's really the only business that's there hey let's go back to that
[15:41.000 --> 15:48.000]  article since I mentioned that for TV viewers do you have email apnea 80% of
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  people stop breathing properly when typing it could be damaging to our health
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  yeah and that's just the beginning like there was a story two days ago about
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  doctors issues stern emergency warning that two-year-olds should not be two
[16:03.000 --> 16:07.000]  years old below should not be allowed to watch television and should have no
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  computer screen time no screen time it 100% rewires the brain and brain
[16:12.000 --> 16:21.000]  damages people it causes literal cognitive brain damage don't you think
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  they knew 40 years ago strapping monkeys up in front of screens baby monkeys
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  what it was doing to them I've actually been allowed at the University of Texas
[16:32.000 --> 16:38.000]  psychology department to see a restricted program when I say allowed I was not

[17:13.000 --> 17:16.000]  monkeys and apes strapped in with the wires in their brains with computer
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  screen savaging the most vicious computer patterns for homo sapien sapien
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  to weaponize television and just hammer us to hell and the scientists even though
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  they were against it were still kind of hopping around telling me about it like
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  it was cute and funny and then oh you're not supposed to see this oh don't look
[17:32.000 --> 17:38.000]  at that oh that's not the monkey farm oh don't look at this DARPA area and I'm

[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  ladies and gentlemen we're back live and by the way I mentioned some of the news
[24:44.000 --> 24:52.000]  that's coming up oh here's just a couple in my stack today LGTV phones home with
[24:52.000 --> 24:58.000]  your viewing habits names of your files your screen and even if you tell it not
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.000]  to that's just the mainstream headline from boing boing see what's happening is
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  all the sheeple now that they have to admit the NSA spying on them because
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  before they'd say none of that's going on we knew 15 16 years ago the cable
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  boxes cell phones were listening tracking had microphones in them we had the
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  patents we had the admissions we had the whistleblowers people would say that's
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  insane I don't believe it I would have program directors call me up and go
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  we're gonna drop your show there's no way you just had a former head of the FBI
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  for all of California on saying that he exposed government satanic ceremonies in
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  northern California that person is not real and I'd go no Ted Gunnerson really
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  was the head of the largest FBI division and he really did expose it and then
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  no it's not true I'm taking you off if I hear and I don't blame them they just
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  wouldn't they thought I was making it up you know world leaders aren't meeting
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000]  doing satanic rituals now everybody knows that stuff goes on here it is
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  mainstream news within the US and England other systems the televisions the
[26:03.000 --> 26:11.000]  Teavos all of them the cable systems are watching everything you do okay here's
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  another one this is out of CNS news this was always the plan they already had black
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  boxes that track you when they plug them in when you get your inspection they
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.000]  download everything now it's live time broadcasting where you are how fast you
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.000]  go everything you do CNS news in HTS a may mandate see it's already in the box
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  of course they're going to mandate it they're announcing it that new cars
[26:33.000 --> 26:41.000]  broadcast location direction and speed total 1984 boom we're going to be getting
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  into that and Paul Watson an article last night that came out that didn't get
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  really any attention it deserves it new media wars the Empire Strikes Back that
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  breaks down how they're going after free speech now big media with government is
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  circling the wagons against the real press you know when you hear Feinstein
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  saying we're going to license who can be media and not and who can protect
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  sources and who can and then she calls it a bill to protect the first amendment
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  just like affordable care acts to make that the care affordable doubling
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  tripling quadrupling prices have you learned yet it's the opposite of what
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  they say if they say they're fighting racism they're promoting racism if they
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  say they're fighting sexism they're promoting sexism and obsession with
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  what sex you are they say they're fighting for equality they're fighting to make
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  everybody be in groups and not just be individuals I'm an individual you're
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  not going to label me but see by labeling me a white male and all this other
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  stuff it labels then as a stereotype of whatever they project on the stereotype
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  so that people will think of me as that first and not a liberty lover not a
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  lover of art and literature and culture and freedom and a hatred of
[27:48.000 --> 27:56.000]  tyrants and an obsession with crushing bullies let's continue here ladies and gentlemen
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  because I mentioned this and I told you this is happening every time it happens
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  no one's in an article yet about how not even my people we should do this maybe
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  tomorrow or something one of my writers listening or somebody else out there listening
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  all the other George Washington blog tends to pick up stuff we call for
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  we tend to see the economic collapse blog do it the
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.000]  fan report all of them tend to so somebody needs to take all the
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  instances of these federal grants all over the country where they set up
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.000]  warrantless blood draws on the side of the highway and these are always federal
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.000]  grants when they have like army and TSA and police out in Tennessee or New York
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  in the middle of nowhere shutting down major highways in the countryside they
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  always do it the middle of nowhere to freak people out it's done as a psych warfare
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  test they had an EU test a whole bunch of them came out the BBC if you don't believe me
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  Ukrainian troops with loaded weapons searching Brits on a major highway in
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  northern England and it was by Sheffield and then a year later they all over
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  Scotland and the Scots actually started getting out and like beating people up
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  and stuff and they were like there was fist fights they were few like
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  foreign troops are gonna search me and it's all a psych warfare test it was a big
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  scandal they had to cover it up what happened it was only in local papers that
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.000]  some of the foreign troops got bossy and got their butts kicked but I'm just
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  telling you folks when I come back I'm gonna break this down for you north Texas
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.000]  driver stopped at roadblock asked for saliva blood the police tried to deny
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  it at first now they've been forced to admit it so again the standard sigh
[29:35.000 --> 29:40.000]  office denying sorry the cops didn't know citizens had already put it on YouTube
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.000]  they were just lying out of default against the enemy that's us and I'm sorry
[29:45.000 --> 29:51.000]  the police operate now in an enemy attack formation we're on the March the
[29:51.000 --> 29:58.000]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000]  here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt
[30:21.000 --> 30:26.000]  producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[30:26.000 --> 30:32.000]  results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important

[31:01.000 --> 31:06.000]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size

[33:25.000 --> 33:37.000]  every time
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.000]  the past is gone
[33:41.000 --> 33:48.000]  I love this part
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  the rest of our lives will go by like dust
[33:53.000 --> 34:00.000]  don't go to your grave
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  being a sellout to the social engineers
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  be real that's what it's all about and none of us are perfect
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  we've all got our dark sides
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  you've got to decide in your heart which side you serve and that's the most
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.000]  important decision of our short lives
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  thank you for joining us on this worldwide broadcast coming up in about 10 minutes
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.000]  we're going to have our reporters down on the ground in daily plaza joining us
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  via Skype they give us a report on what they're seeing down there John Brown
[34:34.000 --> 34:39.000]  before I go any further let me just finish up with this so again the mainstream
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.000]  media local media a lot of times isn't globalist operatives they just go along
[34:43.000 --> 34:48.000]  with the status quo so they always say gee why are police directing people off the
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  way and then ordering them to give urine tissue or blood samples
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  and a lot of times they go people claim they were made to go off a checkpoint
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  and give blood but everybody knows that doesn't happen in America people claim
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  their kids are being given the flu shot without their consent but everyone knows that's illegal
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  oh really next night the school decided it's the best thing to do
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  there's no law we can make your 11 year old have an abortion but we do it
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  your kids belong to us now
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  so that's what they're doing
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  is they are manipulating the media the police
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  the public with federal grants saying if you want this federal grant
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.000]  you're going to shut down I-35 at Kyle and you're going to back
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  traffic up for 30 miles past Georgetown
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  this happened in 1999 it's in my film martial law they did them all over the state
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  and it was federal grants that's how I learned about all this
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  and the federal grant said in the future there'll be internal checkpoints
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.000]  with hardened positions where everyone is searched randomly for their safety
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  and it was a Bill Clinton initiative and I talk about that in my film I show the federal grant
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  I show it all
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  just like schools are scanning
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  children's retinas secretly without them knowing
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  we just showed that headline from RT
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.000]  I mean this is what this country's turned into it's a criminal mass movement against us
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  with everybody compartmentalized these average cops they don't know in some cases
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  they're off duty and hired to do it and others they're told it's a federal grant you will go do this duty
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  and usually we learn about it because one of the police
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  sometimes they have like 50 of them out these things are so big
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  we'll end up calling people they know and saying hey get the media on this man I don't want to be told to do this
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  they direct people off to
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  waystations and off into parking lots and they walk up and say
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  this is a federal operation you have a choice saliva or blood
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  and of course saliva has the biggest cells in the body
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  that slough off by the millions every few months
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  there's thousands at one time your cheek cells
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  your palate cells are big round like
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  that donut like shells that are just in your mouth so they can just swab in there and get a bunch of those
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  and most people go whatever you say officer and they do it
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  and then the media is like big deal a blood checkpoint and see first
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  they do it where it's a DUI no refusal it's for the
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  children and they have fake rubber shampoo warrants once they've done that
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  then they move to just you know we don't need no stinking fake warrants we just
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  do whatever we want so it's going on in Alabama
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  it's going on in Tennessee it's going on in Florida that was the first places
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  then it was going on in Oregon and California and
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  Colorado and Arizona
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  all this craziness went on and now
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  in America in Texas
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  they're just basically ordering people to do it and that's what's coming out in the local news we have an RT report
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  we have an NBC report from north Texas but here it is
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  in America ladies and gentlemen here's part of the newscast if you doubt me
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  Kim Cope was on her lunch break Friday driving north on beach
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  when she came across two police cars with lights flashing
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  yeah they were about right in here she says the uniformed officers
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  directed her into this parking lot and I gestured to the guy in
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  front that I just wanted to go straight but he wouldn't let me and force me into
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  a parking lot that's official oppression she says she couldn't believe what she was asked
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  that's a kidnapping they were asking for cheap swabs
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  they would pay you $10 cash for that they would also if you let them take your blood
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  they would pay you $50 for that or at the very least she says
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  they wanted to test her breath for alcohol for free it just doesn't seem right
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  that you would be forced off of the road when you're not doing anything wrong
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  she says she felt trapped I finally did the breathalyzer test
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  just because I thought that would be the easiest way to leave we asked Fort Worth
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  city police about this the parking lot is on the border of both cities
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  and each department told us they didn't know what we were talking about
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  so who was doing such a survey and why we tracked it down to the national highway
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  traffic safety administration federal agency confirms
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  they're doing this in 30 cities across the country part of an $8 million
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  survey over three years to find out exactly how many drivers are drunk
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  or on drugs the government insists it's 100%
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  and anonymous you can't just be pulled over
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  randomly or for no reason but civil rights attorney Frank Colossi
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  questions whether such stops are constitutional questions
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  there's the fine print on the form given to drivers it informs them their breath
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  was tested when they first stopped by quote passive alcohol
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  sensor readings before the consent process yeah that's enough
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  look the whole point is you're being lied to the whole time they're priming America for
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.000]  hey we've done these checkpoints for a long time the feds are always
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  paying for this and it's going in a database with your name
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  okay this needs but this is nothing they have some of these at night
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  on highways where they actually threaten people
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  and say just give us the blood they don't even offer money and if somebody throws
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  a fit then they give them a coupon that they write in and get the $10
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  $20 $50 depending on which one but this is totally lawless
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  and let me tell you something I'm gonna flip out
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  the next time this happens and get out and start videotaping these highwaymen and that's what they are folks
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  these are highwaymen and just like up in Dallas they're saying
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  well the mayor says no one's allowed to hand out flyers anywhere in downtown Dallas
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  or talk to anybody and then people started filing a lawsuit and the judge said
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  hey mayor you gotta moderate that okay you can hand out flyers but you can't
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  talk to people and you can't videotape anywhere and the judge
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  went oh there's filing lawsuits couple and others you can let
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  citizens videotape for free speech you mean permits for big film crews
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  right so the just Dallas judge knows exactly how they run
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  scams they go yeah you're right but guaranteed they'll have cops walk over here you can't videotape and I'll go
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  you know that's for a commercial operation trying to block traffic for a truck
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  and they'll be like yeah I know I'm just doing my job well
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  do you want to not have checks and balances for your family
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  and almost every cop I talk to like they go no just how haven't I stay
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  they're literally there they sent down
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  from the from the code enforcement office
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  with police and ordered them to arrest my street
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  team handing out 10,000 copies of my magazines downtown and I had to get the cops
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  on the phone I was out of town at the time and go look you guys like look I'm a listener I don't want to do this
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  but I'm gonna get in trouble I go listen no you're not you're gonna get in trouble if you do this
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  I don't want to sue you for arresting or ticketing my reporters
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  and I said and this is in front of my street
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  team they're watching the cop on the cell phone but I said I'm gonna have to for my family
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  and your family I'm going to have to sue you personally if you false arrest them
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  and the cops said alright whatever I hear y'all can talk to my superiors
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  then the police refused issued a new statement that came down to our demonstration
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  I drove back into town from Galveston I got there
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  and then the cops were all out there you know at our demonstration being real friendly and they said absolutely
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  it's pure bull we didn't want to be this we're told to do it good job you know saying no
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  so that we could then go to up the chain of command and get them to say no but I said
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  you shouldn't have to have me come out here and threaten to sue you to do this well that didn't
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  stop them then the code enforcer shows up he's a listener
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  this is on video we have photos of this too and starts telling my street
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  team listen I don't want to do this I like Alex I've been told my job
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  I don't give you a ticket and then we checked the law it was if we had a
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  truck or something blocking the road or we had a hot dog stand we go we're not blocking anything
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  this is First Amendment and he said alright I guess I won't give you
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  the ticket but I might get fired and we said what's the name of your superior
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  because again I was on the phone again and my crew put it on the phone
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  and I had to call his boss and basically threaten them with a lawsuit
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  just so they wouldn't threaten to fire him
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.000]  this is what they're doing they're threatening to fire the code enforcers they're threatening to fire the police
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  basically or write them up if they don't go around and act like North Korean
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  police so this has happened because
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  the American people have put up with it and haven't
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  acted like free humans the police need to say
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  no to unlawful orders the military need to follow their oath and say no to unlawful orders
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  and the American people need to stop acting like a nation of sheep
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  because Thomas Jefferson said a nation of sheep will be ruled
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  by what? wolves
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  well I'm not a sheep and that guy's aggressive
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  that guy's mean that guy gets people's face I'm done man I am nobody
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  special you start a fight with me
[43:58.000 --> 44:02.000]  you get a fight back you push me you get pushed back you try to
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  stomp on me and trample on me I'm gonna stomp on you folks
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.000]  that is not anything abnormal
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  at least in the old days it wasn't abnormal
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  you need to stop acting like slaves if you want to be free
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  in fact that's basically
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  a quote of Harriet Tubman who was
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.000]  a person that made herself free and that's what it comes down to
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.000]  ladies and gentlemen it's very simple if you bend over to the
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.000]  establishment they will rape you and there will be people that
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  will get into the power structure even if you have a good power structure if you lay down
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  you allow the evil to come in unchallenged to take over the government
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  the corporations the churches the culture we are to blame
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  you want to know who's to blame for all this look in the mirror
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  we've got John Bowne reporting from
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  Dealey Plaza via video Skype on a windy day in downtown Dallas
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.000]  the 50th anniversary of the murder of JFK is coming up in two days
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  and John Bowne is part of our advanced team in Dallas I'll be there tonight
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  John Bowne thank you you're there in Dealey Plaza
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.000]  oh yeah you got me there brother
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  yes sir okay John well give us a report on what you've seen
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  the hypocrisy is unbelievable
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.000]  look at this they're digging up the X
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  that marks the spot what are they going to do next move the street
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  they're going to move the whole street so that we can erase the history
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  and behind those barricades we were shoot away by a guy
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  that claims that we got to have a $50 permit to go over there
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.000]  which I'm sure infowars.com puts a permit in we're not
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  getting over there but they try to put the cuffs on us but
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.000]  can you believe this are you there yes you're at Dealey Plaza
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  continue giving us a report so this is big news they're tearing up
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  the X that's been there for 40 years it was put in 10 years
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  10 years after the shooting they are actually tearing up the road
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  and I was told Jim Mars was saying this I could see they're doing it they're tearing out the curbs
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  that have the bullet marks on them so they're actually
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  history right now they're covering up the lie
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  right now as we speak and these guys these poor guys
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  they had to rush out here to do this and we got a bite from them
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  one of the guys said yeah when we get a rush job we get right on it we do it well
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  a rush job for the new world order to make it look all
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  pretty and make the lie shiny and brand new
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  okay now describe what you're seeing in downtown Dallas give us a report there from Dealey Plaza
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  let's move down here we've got a truck behind us
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  hey Jacobson let's head down here so we can hear Alex come on
[46:54.000 --> 46:58.000]  absolutely and just pan around Jacobson and give everybody a shot of Dealey Plaza
[46:58.000 --> 47:02.000]  yep so the barricades are increasing
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  they've uh as we get to the bridge down here
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  they've increased the barricades down here beyond the bridge
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.000]  if you want to turn around and show them that of course we're right here in front of the
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.000]  no the grassy no we've got some folks here some
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  citizens here expressing their their free speech their interest
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  in our bill of rights and our president and the
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.000]  last great man of the people that we had who was
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.000]  part of the wrong royal family and now that raw the other
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  royal family is
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  tearing the street up to cover up their lie
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  this is true the Kennedys did trace their bloodlines to Irish royalty
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.000]  and the globalists are very very obsessed with that and knocking off
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  all the other royalty that isn't Transylvanian and German
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  absolutely yeah uh you come here
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  at night and I put this up on you stream and if you're here
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  around three o'clock in the morning it's an I'm sure you've been here at that time Alex
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  it's pretty eerie out here to actually stand here
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  see the spot where America was killed in broad daylight and they're covering
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  it up like they covered everything else up it's amazing
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  incredible I want you and Rob Jacobson for TV viewers
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  to walk up to the grassy no and show people the picket fence and then go around behind
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  it and give us the the bird's eye view of where they actually fired
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  where the badge man fired in fact if you aim up there towards the fence it's up towards
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  the corner there walk to your right and
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  right up there and then go around the back there and then through the picket fence will give everybody a shot
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  but while you walk up there John Bowne continue to tell us about the police
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  presence what you see going on there well they've got
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  a guy over here in a trench coat who claims that you
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  have to pay $50 in order to go over there across the street want to turn
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  around and show them that area behind the barricade
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  we had to pay we would have to pay $50 and then our
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  then issue the permit you have to go get permission that's the whole point you're in
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  but now go ahead and march back up behind there to the grassy no
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  here we are with our reporters there other tidbits of what's been going on there
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  have you talked to any of the locals
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  yeah the locals there's a lot of people from
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  other countries here right now this is a big event
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  international event so you hear a lot of languages being spoken down there
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.000]  of course you know that the regular
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  freaks are in full view here
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  we've got plenty of people that have made JFK their
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  wife's work but the reason we're here is for the
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  assault on freedom and free speech and
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  it is clearly being murdered
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  right in front of us I mean in slow motion look at that
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  you see the old road that JFK drove down I mean it's kind of
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  a blessing in disguise to see that piece of history right in front of us the old
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  road well this is what mayors and people do that with all these globalists and
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  Joe Biden showing up later today they're literally repaving the streets
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  that have always been concrete with asphalt to make it look nicer
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  or something this is bizarre we're going to go to break John go around behind
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  the picket fence from the actual spot in fact right behind
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  you from the fence is about where the shots were taken from
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  with the black op CIA executioner he Howard Hunt and others
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  so go around back where the shooters were then the jackal was in the building
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  actually straight up the street not the schoolbook building but
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  the one that's directly behind the famous assassin that almost killed the gall
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  he was up there pulling triggers as well we're going to be right back
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  50th anniversary coverage with Rob Jacobson running camera and John
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  Brown on the street in the last 50 years

[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  around the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ

[53:59.840 --> 54:12.600]  Alright folks, we've tried to go up behind the grassy knoll, they've got all that blocked
[54:12.600 --> 54:16.760]  off and that's the media area and they've let John Bown in there because I guess he
[54:16.760 --> 54:21.160]  looks like mainstream media with a microphone flag and he's wearing a black suit.
[54:21.160 --> 54:26.120]  So let's go back to John Bown, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net and his reporter here on the
[54:26.120 --> 54:27.120]  radio with us.
[54:27.120 --> 54:29.400]  John, I wanted to get a shot over the deal.
[54:29.400 --> 54:31.160]  Let's see what this guy has to say.
[54:31.160 --> 54:36.760]  We're trying to get a shot over to see where the shots were taken but apparently only the
[54:36.760 --> 54:40.720]  elite members of our society are allowed to witness this.
[54:40.720 --> 54:42.200]  Ask this guy who he is.
[54:42.200 --> 54:48.760]  Why is it that as an American citizen born and raised here, I can't look at where my
[54:48.760 --> 54:56.680]  brother is, here, here, let the guy talk Bown.
[54:56.680 --> 55:06.560]  Just tell him that they let you in Bown and then leave, get a video of the cop.
[55:06.560 --> 55:09.120]  Don't get the guy in trouble, just say you'll go.
[55:09.120 --> 55:10.120]  Just get the cop on video.
[55:10.120 --> 55:18.600]  I tell you man, it's crazy being like, it's like a general commanding people but you can't
[55:18.600 --> 55:20.280]  get him to do what you want.
[55:20.280 --> 55:22.440]  Chewing that gum with authority, Alex.
[55:22.440 --> 55:23.440]  Oh, the cop was?
[55:23.440 --> 55:24.440]  Oh, yeah.
[55:24.440 --> 55:28.760]  I know, I saw it, he had his hands in his jacket like he was like a third world dictator.
[55:28.760 --> 55:31.360]  Get some more video of the third world dictator.
[55:31.360 --> 55:33.040]  Don't worry, I'm coming.
[55:33.040 --> 55:36.040]  Everybody you need to stand up for the First Amendment.
[55:36.040 --> 55:37.240]  They're calling their mommy.
[55:37.240 --> 55:41.760]  Listen, they don't want us in their Tiananmen Square and that's what this is about.
[55:41.760 --> 55:43.880]  They want to turn Dallas into Tiananmen Square.
[55:43.880 --> 55:48.440]  They want to say no free speech in Tiananmen Square, only the inner party officials are
[55:48.440 --> 55:49.440]  allowed to be in there.
[55:49.440 --> 55:51.920]  Now again, they haven't just blocked off Dealey Plaza now.
[55:51.920 --> 55:55.960]  We're trying to go over by the grassy knoll, over behind that's the media area and some
[55:55.960 --> 56:01.440]  establishment mainstream media person, I guess saw our InfoWars flagged microphone and came
[56:01.440 --> 56:02.960]  over and got in our guy's face.
[56:02.960 --> 56:05.520]  Now, Bown, I want you to go down because I can see you.
[56:05.520 --> 56:07.040]  Everybody can watch this at infowars.com.
[56:07.040 --> 56:11.480]  That's where the feed's at, by the way, I should have said that earlier.
[56:11.480 --> 56:16.320]  And go over there to where the grassy knoll's at and then shoot over the grassy knoll back
[56:16.320 --> 56:18.920]  the other direction over the fence back at them.
[56:18.920 --> 56:19.920]  Tell Jacobson that.
[56:19.920 --> 56:25.680]  I want him to shoot back over at the media, the CIA assassins killed Kennedy from behind
[56:25.680 --> 56:26.680]  that fence.
[56:26.680 --> 56:29.840]  Now the mainstream media is killing the truth from behind that fence.
[56:29.840 --> 56:31.800]  They're firing lies from behind that fence.
[56:31.800 --> 56:32.800]  Here we go.
[56:32.800 --> 56:33.800]  Shoot over it.
[56:33.800 --> 56:35.880]  Shoot over the fence, Jacobson.
[56:35.880 --> 56:41.240]  The mainstream media, it's just, yeah, yeah, just tell them to shoot over the fence back
[56:41.240 --> 56:42.400]  towards the media.
[56:42.400 --> 56:43.400]  This is unbelievable.
[56:43.400 --> 56:46.560]  Yeah, aim it back towards the media, Jacobson.
[56:46.560 --> 56:49.400]  And then aim it behind you at that police officer chewing the gum.
[56:49.400 --> 56:50.400]  Yeah, obviously.
[56:50.400 --> 56:51.400]  Aim it at things that are interesting.
[56:51.400 --> 56:53.040]  Here we go.
[56:53.040 --> 56:55.000]  That's the shot I want right there.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  Interesting here, Alex.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.280]  I would have gone over and talked to the cops.
[56:58.280 --> 57:03.080]  Now tell Jacobson, continue to shoot back over the fence to the media that's occupied
[57:03.080 --> 57:05.560]  the grassy knoll, where the shooters were at.
[57:05.560 --> 57:11.080]  The elitist treasonous media that's occupied the history that we're standing on right now
[57:11.080 --> 57:14.960]  that every citizen in this country has a right to be standing on.
[57:14.960 --> 57:15.960]  The bad craziness.
[57:15.960 --> 57:16.960]  I hear you.
[57:16.960 --> 57:17.960]  Hey, John, can you hear me?
[57:17.960 --> 57:18.960]  Yeah, I can.
[57:18.960 --> 57:23.000]  Ask Jacobson to shoot back into the media area over the fence.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.520]  Shoot back into the media area that we're- Shoot the moon!
[57:26.520 --> 57:27.520]  Shoot the moon!
[57:27.520 --> 57:31.000]  I feel like a Sergeant Stedenko, literally.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  What do you guys got?
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.640]  Pizzas and a smoking van over there?
[57:33.640 --> 57:36.200]  Listen, just shoot the moon!
[57:36.200 --> 57:40.280]  Yeah, so that's the area we were throwing out.
[57:40.280 --> 57:44.720]  And then across the street is the other area we were thrown out of, and they have these
[57:44.720 --> 57:51.120]  official badges on credentialed media.
[57:51.120 --> 57:52.120]  Credentialed media.
[57:52.120 --> 57:54.120]  That means they agree with the official story.
[57:54.120 --> 57:55.120]  Oh.
[57:55.120 --> 57:58.280]  And you're $50, and you pass the background check.
[57:58.280 --> 58:02.960]  Hey, see what this guy right here thinks about the 50th, and what he thinks really happened.
[58:02.960 --> 58:05.840]  What do you think about the 50th anniversary, sir?
[58:05.840 --> 58:06.840]  I think it's important.
[58:06.840 --> 58:10.160]  Yeah, well, what do you think about the fact they're digging up the-
[58:10.160 --> 58:12.440]  X marks the spot out there in haste.
[58:12.440 --> 58:13.440]  Let him talk.
[58:13.440 --> 58:16.360]  A lot of stuff in the papers about that too, you know, and I didn't even know until I got
[58:16.360 --> 58:17.360]  here, you know.
[58:17.360 --> 58:18.360]  Where are you from?
[58:18.360 --> 58:19.360]  Repaving.
[58:19.360 --> 58:20.360]  I'm from Michigan.
[58:20.360 --> 58:21.600]  And you came all the way down here for this?
[58:21.600 --> 58:23.920]  I was 12 years old at the time, and it happened, so.
[58:23.920 --> 58:27.280]  Do you want to recount any- how you felt that day?
[58:27.280 --> 58:32.120]  Yeah, the teacher in our school went over and stared out the window, and he acts like he
[58:32.120 --> 58:35.520]  didn't even know the rest of the class was there, and I think the first time in my life
[58:35.520 --> 58:37.520]  I seen a grown man cry.
[58:37.520 --> 58:43.200]  Yeah, we'll be back.
[58:43.200 --> 58:51.520]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.520 --> 58:56.480]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how
[58:56.480 --> 58:57.760]  do I safeguard?
[58:57.760 --> 59:00.280]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Scalzen.
[59:00.280 --> 59:04.520]  The U.S. isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist
[59:04.520 --> 59:05.520]  threat.
[59:05.520 --> 59:07.840]  A massive nuclear attack is coming.
[59:07.840 --> 59:09.280]  They want that attack to come.
[59:09.280 --> 59:14.320]  Joel Scalzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and
[59:14.320 --> 59:15.960]  the securing of your home.
[59:15.960 --> 59:18.600]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[59:18.600 --> 59:22.640]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about pollution, the
[59:22.640 --> 59:23.640]  water quality.
[59:23.640 --> 59:27.320]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even
[59:27.320 --> 59:31.360]  be ready and won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[59:31.360 --> 59:34.120]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[59:34.120 --> 59:40.360]  These Christmas give the gift of preparedness strategic relocation film with Joel Scalzen

[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:41.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, John Bowne and Rob Jacobson running camera there.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.360]  He's an award-winning cinematographer.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.880]  Actually, he's a great camera guy, but the point is he keeps aiming the camera at the
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.680]  ground if you're watching us at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.840]  Tell Bowne to go get down on the sidewalk, say, hey, you want to be on TV?
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.360]  What's your view of the 50th?
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.720]  And we'll come back from break and have a bunch of people come up and give their views
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.720]  on the street.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720]  Can you hear me, John Bowne?
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.080]  Yeah, I've got a few people here ready to talk.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.040]  OK, OK, just ask them quick and move the next person.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.720]  Do you have any questions about the official story like the Secretary of State John Kerry?
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.200]  Do you have any questions about the official story like the Secretary of State John Scowin
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.400]  Bowne's Kerry?
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.400]  Questions no.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.400]  I think we pretty much know what happened.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.400]  You know.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.560]  On Easter, Bowne did it.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.760]  I feel so sorry for that man, I really do.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.240]  How about you, sir?
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.240]  Oh, look at that guy.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.240]  How do you feel?
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.240]  I don't believe it.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.840]  I definitely believe there's conspiracy, but it really won't ever now.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.840]  We'll never know because they're digging the street up.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840]  How about you, sir?
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.120]  How do you feel about the official story?
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.920]  Well, I felt we were all numb that day.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.840]  But when Ruby shot Oswald, I said something is not right.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.680]  From that day on, I knew and I said it can't be.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.080]  And then the European reports right away were saying, how could he be shot in the front
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.560]  from the back?
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:06.520]  No one knew that the official report all over the world was the only United States.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:11.440]  And Arlen Specter with the conspirators had to come up with a single bullet theory.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.280]  Otherwise, there's got to be more than one shooter.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:19.160]  Yeah, the Warren Commission was full of people that JFK had fired.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.280]  Anybody else want to comment on the official story?
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.120]  You're believing the official story.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:28.960]  Do you believe the official story?
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.840]  I think I don't think Oswald shot it.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.080]  It's pretty impossible.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.840]  Yeah, I go behind you with that big crowd is there's actually a bunch of famous researchers
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.840]  over there.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.600]  I can recognize some of them go over there, get their take on it.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.200]  We're going to come back from break in a minute and then we're going to cover some other
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.200]  news coming up.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.880]  But this is this is historical.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.080]  And obviously, wherever the crowd is, I bet that's Groden over there, one of the most
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.800]  famous researchers that got all the time live stuff because he worked there.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.360]  He's the guy that got the real Subruder film.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.160]  I'm guessing that's Groden from what I just saw.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.640]  Go interview the activist, go talk to the people like we talked about before you guys
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.920]  went down there.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.520]  And we're looking for a brown van, a brown van.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.680]  It's more cheats and chon clothes.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.680]  Sorry, folks.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.560]  A little bit of an inside joke here.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.000]  But we're going to go ahead and start talking to some folks.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.520]  Go ahead, John Bowne.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.600]  Sir, how do you feel about the official story?
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.600]  Are you learning something today?
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.600]  Probably yes.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.360]  There you go, okay, a lot of folks from all over the world here today.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360]  How do you feel about it?
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.360]  The whole thing.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.360]  Shoot the moon.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.160]  That guy is literally sitting there saying that he didn't want to talk to you.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.200]  Listen, go up during the break.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.640]  Tell that guy we're doing national TV.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.320]  We'd like him to give us his presentation.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.600]  Yeah, that guy I think works for Groden.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.840]  Yeah, I know him.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.600]  Okay, so get I forget that fellow's name.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.600]  Get his name.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.600]  Come back.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.600]  Introduce him.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.600]  Just say hi.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.080]  I really want to talk to you and all the little minions trying to impact you won't be upset
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.080]  anymore.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.080]  And then we can talk to him.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.080]  We've talked to him.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.120]  You can then turn and say, can we take a pause in your presentation and talk to all these
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.120]  folks?
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.680]  You can have them all lined up right there from the memorial up there right by the grassy
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.800]  knoll.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:16.120]  So this is all coming up live coverage with our Vanguard forces, Rob Jacobson and John
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.120]  Bowne.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.160]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, I am Sargeant Statinko.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:28.400]  We're going to go to break and oh my goodness.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:36.120]  And if you I'm going to get serious when we come back after the 80th time offer.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.840]  I'm like, anyways, it doesn't matter.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.720]  We're going to come right back, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm going to get really serious
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.800]  because we have parents being arrested trying to pick their kids up from school.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.080]  We have the new boxes in your cars to track you and touch you by the mile.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.680]  We have illegal checkpoints taking blood on the side of the highway.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:05:01.280]  It's all coming up straight ahead the 50th anniversary of the magic bullet.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.280]  Alex Jones here.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.400]  And I want to tell you about a long time friend of the show, my patriot supply.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.760]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.280]  secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:21.080]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.440]  values as their fellow patriots.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:29.200]  My Patriot supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.200]  fine preparedness products.

[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.920]  other special offers.

[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.880]  advances on every front.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:06:00.360]  It is essential to prepare with my Patriot supply today.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:04.600]  My friends Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.640]  you and your family's health.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:10.360]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.800]  from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.960]  No active contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.000]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.760]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.760]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.800]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.800]  your family.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.960]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:40.560]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.920]  iodine exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:50.640]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.560]  filter element.

[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.200]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.400]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:29.200]  Alright folks, I've got John Bowne, Infowars, Natalie News reporter and radio producer
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.520]  there with Rob Jacobson at the Grassy Knoll at the original Kennedy Memorial 50 years
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.000]  later, 50 years on Friday.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:45.800]  Richard Groden, good friend of mine, probably one of the most informed JFK researchers, the
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.000]  guy that worked at Timelife Books who got the original Subridder film, made a copy before
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  they cut it up.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  He was the one that exposed that.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.760]  He's the one that released the photos with Kennedy's head almost completely blown off.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.040]  He's right there on screen with all his documentation.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:06.480]  So John Bowne, go ahead and tell him Alex says hi, we're on TV and radio and give folks
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.480]  his take.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.520]  Not on JFK 50 years later, we want to do that next.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.760]  Ask him about the restrictions on free speech first.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.440]  Ask him about how unprecedented that is.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.800]  Okay, sir, we want to know about your view on these restrictions of the free speech here,
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.800]  them digging the ground up, the crew that's pushing everybody out and the fact that we're
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.000]  going to be restricted from this area in the next couple of days.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.520]  What are your thoughts on that?
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.160]  My thoughts are that it's against the Constitution.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.360]  This is a federal landmark.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.120]  They have no right to do this.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.280]  I'm in the process of suing the city right now for First Amendment violations and this
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.400]  is just going to add to it.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.280]  How about the digging up of the X down here?
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.280]  The rust job of digging up the X?
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.920]  That's a bit of a joke, I think.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.320]  They said they didn't want anyone to trip over the X's.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.840]  It makes no sense at all.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.880]  All it was was tape.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.080]  Did you put that X there?
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:02.920]  I put that X down there 19 years ago and every couple of weeks we refresh it.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.920]  It's tape.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.480]  It's not paint.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.560]  As the cars run over it, of course, it wears it down.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.560]  So we replace it and we've kept it going for all these years and we're going to do it
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.560]  again.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.720]  And again, I haven't seen Robert Groden, not Richard Groden, in about three, four years,
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.240]  but many times I've gone up there into documentaries and made films with him.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.040]  He, of course, helped on the film JFK of your radio listener.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.800]  There he is on screen for TV viewers.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:30.560]  Everybody can find the free feed at infowars.com forward slash show, a fusion of all the different
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.960]  reporter feeds we're going to have over the next few days.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.960]  Bookmark that.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.200]  This is the real media.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:42.280]  Ask Robert Groden to talk more about how the police and mainstream media have been behaving
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.480]  and how the mainstream media just ran you off from behind the grassy knoll.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.080]  Hey, we're live.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.080]  We're live.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.080]  Sorry.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.080]  Sorry.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.080]  Yeah.
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:58.520]  Alex's next question is about how the police and the mainstream media have been active
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.200]  to everybody here towards you personally.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.120]  Have you seen anything today or as the event unfolded?
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.720]  Well, the alternative newspaper here in Dallas, the Dallas Observer has been extremely supportive.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.040]  They're really concerned about the First Amendment.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.920]  And they've written over 40 articles dealing with what the cities try to do to me.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.360]  The Dallas Morning News, on the other hand, has taken the point of view that I don't
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.360]  even exist.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360]  That's right.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:28.360]  Get him to talk about the Dallas Morning News in Bilo and their history of their 50-year
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.560]  history of covering up the JFK murder.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:35.720]  Can you talk about Bilo and their 50-year history of covering up the murder?
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:39.680]  Well, I mentioned a minute ago, the Dallas Observer.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:47.120]  They just about three weeks ago did an amazingly in-depth article about how the Bilo Corporation
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:53.280]  has been involved with a, quote, city of hate for all this time and how they fed that attitude
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.280]  of hate.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.280]  Right.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.120]  Get him to elaborate on other points about the 50th and then get him to spend five minutes
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:05.040]  summing up the JFK assassination from his deepest of research.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.520]  Can you elaborate on the 50th and then sum up from your deepest of research?
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:15.760]  You are the man, the deepest nuggets we can get of your JFK research.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.760]  Wow.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.800]  Well, I've been down here for the last 19 years, but I've been working on the case for
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.440]  all 50 since it happened.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.800]  The greatest, most important evidence is the Zapruder film of the assassination and the
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.480]  testimony of the Dallas doctors.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.120]  When I worked for the government, when I worked for the House Assassinations Committee, I
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.320]  interviewed over 20 of them.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.720]  Every single one of them told me that the shot came from the front.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.960]  Additionally, we now have 88 people who have seen the President's body that testified that
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.560]  the shot came from the front and exited the rear.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.400]  That's important.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.320]  What the city is doing is absolutely absurd.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.960]  For 49 years now, people like myself have kept this issue alive.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.120]  We've been respectful.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.400]  We've had our moment of silence.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.320]  Now all of a sudden, it's the magic 50th, all of a sudden, the city wants to pretend
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.960]  we don't exist and pretend they've been here all the time.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.920]  Not one of them has had anything to do with this in all of these years.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:23.160]  How about James Tague and the third man that was actually shot and what's your experience
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.440]  with Mr. Tague?
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.320]  Jim and I have been friends for quite a few years.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.000]  He just wrote a second book.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.640]  He was hit at the time of the assassination and because of him, the government had to
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.880]  create the fairy tale of the single bullet theory.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.080]  You couldn't get enough shots off to do all that damage within the time frame.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.000]  So they created this fairy tale of the single bullet theory and Jim's the reason why they
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.320]  had to do it.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.680]  And so when he went to the Warren Commission, what are your thoughts on the Warren Commission?
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.560]  The Warren Commission was a joke.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.520]  Their job was never to find out who killed President Kennedy.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:01.360]  Their job was to stop the rumors of conspiracy and they did their job at any cost.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.360]  They didn't care about the truth.
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.360]  They never did.
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.680]  Why did they want Kennedy killed?
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.200]  When you say they, you mean the people who killed him?
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.680]  Well, there's any number of reasons.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.720]  Our problem has never been trying to find who wanted the president dead.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:19.280]  The problem has been to try to find who succeeded.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.520]  The president was ending the Vietnam War.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:27.280]  Big business and a lot of money to some very, very rich, powerful people.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.760]  When he ordered our withdrawal from Vietnam, they must have run for the hills.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.960]  And out of the way, they ran into a couple of expenses.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:33.960]  All right.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.160]  We're having a little bit of a skype issue.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.880]  I think when we send them audio, I'm trying to tell John there, step behind the scenes
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:45.840]  that actually cuts out the audio, but we're finding the only, go ahead, Alex.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:48.520]  No, no, just, just hold on one moment.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.560]  We were trying to have you guys raise the camera and then actually cut out your audio,
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.560]  sending that to you.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.240]  So just tell Jacobson, raise the camera first.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.560]  We'll direct this from here.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.160]  And then expanding on that, get him to talk about his key role in getting out the only
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.120]  photos in the real Zebruder film.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.080]  Get him to discuss that.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.080]  Hang on, sir.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.080]  Can we, can we?
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.120]  That's Mark Anderson from American Free Press right there.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.440]  We'll interview him in a moment.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.440]  Go ahead and get him to finish.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.440]  Sorry.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.440]  I apologize.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.560]  Yeah, the key role of the Zebruder film, your opinion on that.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.400]  Well, no, how he got it out.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.880]  And how you got it out.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:30.760]  I released the film of the assassination at a press conference in Boston in 1975.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.080]  It was picked up as a major news story and Geraldo Rivera, back in the days when he was
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:40.000]  honest about this, wanted to show it on his show.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.960]  And we did show it and it did change the course of the history of this case.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:49.840]  The Zebruder film is the only complete record of what actually did happen here.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:55.760]  And in spite of all the silly rumors that it's not genuine, the film really is.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.680]  And my argument on that is, if you're going to fake the film, you're going to fake it
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.520]  to tell your story, not the opposite of it.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.520]  Great.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.520]  Thank you.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:08.360]  Get him to talk about his role because, and then you can let Anderson ask a question and
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.200]  we'll cover Anderson's question.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.200]  I think that's Mark Anderson.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.200]  It sure looked like him.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.200]  I know him well.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.440]  The American Free Press was trying to jump in and ask a question.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:21.240]  Get him to specifically talk about, okay, Skype went down, tell him to reconnect.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.640]  And again, this is kind of a fun train wreck, folks.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:29.880]  This is real cutting edge, live, unscripted Skype video interviews from the Grassy Knoll.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.960]  I'm here in Austin, Texas, but I'm going to be down there with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.920]  I'm going to be there with John Bowne.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.960]  I'm going to be there with Darren McBrain.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.440]  I'm going to be there with Kit Daniels.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.880]  I'm going to be there with a bunch of other crew.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.000]  Rob Do is a great reporter and a great camera guy.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  We've got a whole bunch of video phones, a whole bunch of iPhone 5s.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  We're going to be down there doing live reports big time.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.960]  And we're going to have a demonstration tonight at 9 o'clock, 8 to 9 o'clock central at Pearl
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.200]  Street in front of the Federal Reserve.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.080]  And I've already demonstrated there three times before.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.440]  A lot of you come out to that.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.840]  There's a lot of parking around the area.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:13.240]  There's a huge, elaborate ornate sidewalk right there by the expressway in Pearl.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.240]  It's a nice, safe area of Dallas.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.800]  That's why we're choosing it for a nighttime demonstration to protest the private Federal
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:20.800]  Reserve.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.760]  The Dallas Fed's actually been criticizing the national feds, actually the best fed
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.760]  there is.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:28.800]  But of the private banking cartels, they don't want to totally ruin America, but they're
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.800]  the minority.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:33.160]  But we're going to be there protesting the national fed and its branch.
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:39.520]  And then we're going to hand out 30,000 flyers to the folks that show up a hundred a piece.
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:44.320]  We need at least 300 people to show up and hand out the flyers that night and amount
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.600]  the next day on Thursday or on Friday morning so that people know about the censorship and
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.800]  now they're trying to turn it into Yemen Square and restrict free speech.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:58.440]  The mayor has already backed off quite a bit because of the judge and lawsuits, Groden
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.440]  suing him.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.800]  I mean, it's just amazing the stuff they're doing.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.600]  And of course, there is Robert Groden, I don't know if I'm saying Richard Groden, I'm
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:09.720]  teleprompter free folks, I'm gonna make mistakes, but I've worked with him for many years.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.240]  The problem with the JFK film is I've been making a JFK film for eight years now.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:17.480]  I probably have no exaggeration, 300 hours of footage.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:25.000]  I broke the E Howard Hunt video and coast to coast broke the audio.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.400]  We worked together on that of his deathbed confessions.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.920]  He thought he was gonna die twice and then finally did die the second time with cancer.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.920]  Really tough guy.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.040]  I had like 50 something surgeries, you name it.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.160]  Interviewed his son, got all the documents, Groden, everybody.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:44.560]  I mean, it is just insane how obvious it is that they killed Kennedy.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.880]  And we know who did it.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.200]  We know the shooters from just all the witnesses, all the angles, all the photos.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.720]  We know how they did it.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.160]  We know why they did it.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:58.400]  We know the meetings they had, secret service agent in Chicago blew the whistle weeks before
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.360]  they were gonna kill him there.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.360]  That got stopped.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:04.760]  They were gonna kill him in Miami, but FBI people leaked it.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.760]  I mean, they called the secret service off in Dallas that day.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.120]  We ever get them to reconnect with Skype?
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.120]  Oh boy.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.120]  All right.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.600]  Well, I thought they had battery packs.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.600]  We'll figure it out.
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.600]  It doesn't matter.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.800]  I'm sending like seven, eight reporters.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.680]  So the guys are doing a great job.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:34.800]  It's just, it's so fun to, you know, almost the Keystone cop slapstick stuff of real live
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.800]  scripted reporting.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.440]  That's why folks love us.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.440]  Myself included.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.800]  I sound like a buffoon at the time trying to direct people, but it's real and it's powered
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.960]  by truth and liberty and justice.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.520]  We'll be right back with all the big news.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:52.400]  Your phone calls and more and more live reports from Dealey Plaza, but join me tonight eight
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:57.200]  o'clock in front of the Federal Reserve and call everybody, you know, in Texas to be there.
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:04.880]  And then we're going to march tomorrow for the First Amendment.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:10.320]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.360]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.280]  Police call it robbery.
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.160]  We call it avoidable.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.280]  We are fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:27.620]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:32.240]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.840]  on to an easier target.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:40.600]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes

[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:00.320]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.320]  My name's Bruno.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.320]  I'm 52 years old.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:06.080]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:08.560]  I tried one World Way and found it to be delicious.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.880]  After 10 weeks on one World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.400]  when you were 20 years old.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.440]  My body has changed dramatically.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.600]  I'm a cyclist, normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:25.440]  After being on one World Way, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.600]  I take another two servings of one World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.600]  and a half.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.780]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:37.080]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.480]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.080]  One World Way comes in single servings, just give it a try.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.840]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325.

[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.920]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored and more than half of generator failures during
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.720]  disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.840]  PRI fuel stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.840]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and Ships at Sea rely on PRI fuel
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.840]  stabilizers.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.840]  And you can too.

[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:00.640]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:03.800]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:08.480]  Big Berkey water filters, yes, the gift of clean water, a gift that provides a great
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.720]  foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:16.800]  A big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride,
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.560]  pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:23.440]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.160]  no additional investment.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:29.600]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require and are even
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:34.600]  powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:40.080]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.360]  filter systems.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:48.840]  Order online at bigberkeywaterfilters.com, spelled big, B-E-R-K-E-Y, waterfilters.com
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:56.000]  or call 877-99 Berkey, that's 877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.440]  First well this Christmas, give a big Berkey water filter.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:16.000]  This could be a Harry.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Pass the word along.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  Tell the men, it's time to shoot the moon.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  Shoot the moon!
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:35.240]  That's from Cheech and Chong up in Smoke.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.680]  And again, my reporters are great.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:40.600]  It's like the way we're coordinating things, things never coordinate the way you think
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.600]  you will.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.840]  So it's like unintentional comedy.
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:51.680]  For me, like up here trying to like, tell them what to do and things happening on the
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:55.000]  street, it's pretty funny.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.080]  But a lot of you probably don't even get the humor, but if you worked in media or any
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.400]  of this kind of stuff, it is just like you're trying to coordinate people and then it just
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:06.400]  almost never happens the way you think it will.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.680]  Sometimes though, good stuff happens because you have no idea what's about to happen.
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:15.520]  So I go, go behind the grassy knoll and it turns out that's the whole media area and
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.320]  they let them in and then one guy runs over and it looks like some establishment, you
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:27.080]  know, minion, just complete tool bag, getting in their face all arrogant.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:32.520]  Let me tell you, so-called dinosaur mainstream media, establishment media, they are some
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.960]  of the most arrogant idiots.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:43.920]  Even as their ship literally sinks into the sea of oblivion, even as they become a memory
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:51.160]  of a memory, a shadow of a shadow, a distant legend of a fable, of a forgotten dream of
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:56.280]  control freaks, they still cling to their arrogance and their failure.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:02.240]  They are absolutely discredited and jokes back there with the police and everyone trying
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:11.840]  to sell their ridiculous, vapid construction, their fraud, their deceit upon the people.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.520]  By the way, below broadcasting TV and radio or now calling us running interviews, I certainly
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.520]  look forward to that.
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.640]  We're doing some live Skype and live Ustream feeds.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.040]  Come on in, my friend.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.360]  We've got CJ in here right now.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.720]  Here, let me videotape CJ.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.440]  You mind being on TV CJ?
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440]  You don't mind?
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.680]  You're wearing the green lantern outfit.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.400]  Somehow, I think that's racist against Martians.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.200]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get serious and reset when I come back
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:46.920]  in the next segment and get to a whole bunch of key news and information because I've got
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.400]  so much serious news, but I kind of do get in a little bit of a joking mood.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:51.400]  I've got to be honest.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.560]  I should go on the road more because when I do go on the road, it's exciting.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.880]  It's fun and we have a lot of fun fighting tyranny.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.080]  And I want to meet you tonight at the kickoff of the demonstrations three days of it at
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.080]  the Federal Reserve.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.080]  By the way, we're not getting a permit.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:06.400]  I hope all these anarchists and libertarians, they will get permits and everything.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.000]  There'll probably be some other libertarian group like get a permit and tell me I'm not
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.400]  welcome when I get there, like some of the locals do, but the whole point is our demonstration,
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.120]  that's one tactic they do, that will be eight o'clock tonight, Pearl Street, they're in
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.720]  front of the Federal Reserve and Paul Watson is doing another article off of Adon Salazar's
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:23.720]  with the update.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:27.240]  I've got to go get with Rob do and decide right now where our demonstration is going
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:30.440]  to be tomorrow.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.680]  We had success on that test.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.800]  Thank you, Houston.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.000]  So we're in here testing some of our live feeds for I get on the road.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.200]  I am an extremist reporter.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:43.880]  I'm actually testing the equipment before I go and multitasking while I'm there.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.560]  The joke with Laurel and Hardy is that I literally eight times said, you know, you're leaving
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:53.680]  and you're going to test the Skype and you're going to test the Ustream before you go, right?
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.480]  And then this morning they're calling, well, what's the pass codes to this?
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.880]  I was like, yeah, but anyways, the the the anger they're supposed to report last night
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.360]  is now given way to that's why I like them.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:12.800]  I actually felt like the guy despicable me and he has all those minions anyways, but
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.680]  I'm just I'm even worse than they are, so it's all right.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:22.080]  Anyways, I've actually found minions are more effective than because if you have like a
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.680]  giant group of them, they like, you can just like release them and they do some amazing
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680]  stuff.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.880]  It's actually the genius, the genius of the minion.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:34.760]  Actually, I'm a minion, ladies and gentlemen, I'm actually the king minion around here,
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.160]  the king goblin, you could say.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:40.880]  And that's why I cherish my little goblin like creatures.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:44.960]  But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to go to break and I'm going to get
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:45.960]  serious.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.520]  I a lot of times I read all this music really mad before I come in on air, then I start
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.560]  screwing around on air and then I'm not upset anymore.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.400]  And then I can't even cover the news because I don't want to look at it.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.200]  We return from this break.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.640]  It's good to remember to breathe sometimes.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:06.640]  When I return, by the way, if you think we're joking about the city removing the X's that
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:10.480]  Groden put there, they're they're not even painting over them where they kill Kennedy.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.920]  They're actually they're actually asphalting over it like they've done the truth on so
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.920]  many occasions.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.600]  But we see them asphalting over the truth.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:21.800]  We see the corporate devil media behind the grass, you know, firing lies at the public
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.840]  like the globalists fired at Kennedy with bullets, firing their propaganda from over
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:34.320]  the hedge over the fence, like pit bulls finding our reporters that had dared interlope into
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:42.920]  their nest of iniquity, running them out like a pack of disease PCP laden rabies driven
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:49.720]  chihuahuas after our precious John Brown and our precious Rob Jacobson.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.000]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.440]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:30:00.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.000]  I had tried everything.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.360]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.520]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:12.120]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:17.720]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.280]  and be satisfied.
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:23.240]  Now there are hundreds of great products at infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:30.840]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:35.000]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst and Rebound.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.760]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.200]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.640]  Now that's results.
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:48.400]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarsteam.com and to order just three of
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.400]  their products.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:55.480]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:06.160]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.480]  do I safeguard.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.960]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Scowzen.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.560]  The US isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.520]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.960]  They want that attack to come.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:24.000]  Joel Scowzen is renowned as one of the world's far most experts in strategic relocation and
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.640]  the securing of your home.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:28.280]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:31.040]  We talk about natural disasters, the health environment.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.200]  We talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.000]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.040]  be ready and won't be able to get out of town because there will be absolute panic.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.800]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.320]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:55.280]  Strategic relocation film with Joel Scowzen and Alex Jones available only at infowarsteam.com

[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:05.200]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:10.680]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.680]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.680]  Fluoride.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:21.000]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  iodine.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.960]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports documented,
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:33.480]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.600]  Some line iodine is important.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:42.120]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:47.720]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at infowarsleif.com.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:52.440]  Infowars life, Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:53.880]  I take it every day.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:33:10.520]  That's infowarslife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:11.520]  You want answers?
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.520]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:25.840]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:29.440]  We're going into Dallas, armed with the First Amendment and Liberty.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.240]  We're not going to let them turn it into Tiananmen Square where there's no free speech.
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:41.640]  Our X-wings, literally, of the Infowars will be taking over Dealey Plaza, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.360]  This is going to be a historic event.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360]  That's all I can tell people.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:54.400]  There will be some surprises that are legal and lawful to retake America and retake the
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.720]  First Amendment.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.040]  And so we are doing the best we can.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.160]  Let me open the phones up to balance the transmission, interspersed with a ton of news.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.000]  We've got a bunch of backup battery packs, but I guess those were left in the hotel
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.400]  so the iPhone died, so they're going back to get the batteries and then they're going
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.560]  to come back out at the end of the show and we'll have some more live feeds there on the
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.480]  ground with our reporters.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:23.880]  The Intrepid's gone bound and Rob Jacobson now continuing here with the really serious
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.600]  news today.
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:30.200]  Coming up, Donald Sutherland, I want Hunger Games to stir up revolution, but what revolution
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.280]  is he speaking of precisely?
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.160]  Also, implanting platinum jewelry in your eye, boy, that sounds idiotic, but if they
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:41.600]  can get Cayenne West to do it, I'm sure people would pull their eyeballs out with pliers
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.080]  because it's so cool.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:47.200]  Also, Obama carries an epic disaster, just blame the Republicans.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.560]  They're coming out now with the boxes and all the new cars to track and trace you.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.920]  There's new developments on that front, huge Fukushima developments.
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.960]  Forbes gets it right and says Obama is becoming a dictator.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.480]  I will cover all of that coming up.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:05.440]  But first off, I mentioned this last hour, the videos up on infowars.com.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:12.420]  Life Texas drivers stopped and forced at checkpoints into driveways and then intimidated
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:15.760]  into giving urine, blood samples and other things.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:23.080]  This is happening everywhere under federal grants in 30 major cities right now.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.360]  That's up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com right now.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.360]  It's a big deal.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:33.080]  Now, let's shift gears to the next little tidbit of tyranny and this is happening everywhere.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:38.120]  The feds have said, Charlotte Isherby's former head of the Department of Education policy,
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:45.520]  number two in that administration, under the head of the Department of Public Education,
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:46.520]  got the documents.
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.600]  It's in her book, Deliberate Dumming Down, that's back in print now, available at infowars.com.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.920]  I should add if you want to actually read the facts.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:57.880]  They said, we're going to use the schools to become the new spy network and we're going
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:01.320]  to break up the families and we're going to make people work so hard in society by the
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.360]  taxes and regulations that the kids have got to stay at school till eight or nine at night.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.240]  This is in the 80s, the plan.
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.560]  And then we're going to basically completely break up the family and poor kids will just
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.640]  start living in dormitories seven days a week, maybe seeing their parents a few hours on
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:24.880]  the weekend, just like Chinese communist style dormitories were established in the 70s nationwide,
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.000]  actually in many areas by the 50s and 60s.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.440]  This is a total collectivization plan where they're going to raise the property taxes and
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:38.720]  things up to the point of where you've got to live in a 250 square foot apartment.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.920]  You say, well, I won't live in that.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:47.240]  Oh, yes, you will, yes, you will when they're done and you will pay the foreign banks that
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:49.400]  own most of the big high rise apartments.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.800]  You will pay to do that because they're not going to let you build outside those areas.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:59.600]  That's agenda 21, a total managed mafia economy with a scientific technocracy in their own
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:07.880]  words, surveilling everything to implement a systematic destruction of liberty and prosperity
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:13.560]  and enslavement to get us in the crosshairs in the sweet spot of debilitated, poisoned,
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:19.000]  dumbed down, atomized by ourselves, no family, no culture, no community, nobody to stand
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  up, the individual absolutely absorbed into the corporate blandopolis towards population
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.800]  reduction and final mass extermination.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:35.160]  That is from pillar to post, the chronicle in the last one minute when I broke down,
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:40.840]  the mission of the New World Order.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:46.800]  And it challenges the sanity to face that truth, I understand.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.200]  But that's the facts.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.200]  That's their own statements.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:54.760]  I can have former top congressional advisors on Anthony Sutton's colleague just last week
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.320]  with all the documents of the total plan.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.320]  I mean, it's all public.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:05.520]  I literally own hundreds of books written by all the top technocracy people, all of
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.520]  them.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:10.760]  And there's always just more and more to read.
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:14.120]  It's all just totally planned, totally being executed.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:17.880]  And we're scrabbling against the gates as they try to close them, having some effect.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.200]  We could get out of this if people would just wake up.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.280]  But you've got to admit the tyranny's there.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.640]  You've got to admit the evil's taking place or we have no hope.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:32.760]  And I know you know that, but we've got to get that out to everybody.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.720]  We've got to realize how much trouble we're in.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:38.400]  And you know, I've got gallows humor about this whole thing.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:40.160]  I'm really cheerful about it all.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.160]  At least I'm awake.
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:42.160]  At least I'm doing the best.
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.160]  God knows my heart.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:46.480]  And I just had to turn it loose and give it to God because I would get really mad at
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:51.360]  myself wanting to do more broadcast, wanting to do a better job, wanting to not get exhausted,
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.880]  wanting to be able to change things, wanting to be able to show people I'm telling the
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:54.880]  truth.
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:55.880]  And you know what?
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.600]  If everybody out there doesn't know we're in trouble, they're never going to know.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.320]  So the people that are awake are awake and we've just got to say no to the system and
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:06.080]  block the system at every front and not comply.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:10.080]  It was 5% won the Revolutionary War against the British who'd never been defeated in their
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.080]  history ever.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.400]  Except I guess by the Romans, that was what you'd call pre-British.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:24.520]  Because we beat them just with perseverance, that's what George Washington had.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:28.680]  The King of England, when George Washington refused to be king of the United States, he
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:33.080]  was offered it and would have gotten the support and we'd have, you know, King George the Ninth
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:40.600]  right now was called the greatest man alive in the world in a public pronouncement.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.440]  He had defeated the greatest army the world had ever seen that was just smashing the Spanish
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:53.440]  and French and Russians and the Austrian military, which was one of the biggest in the world
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:59.200]  at the time, smashing everybody worldwide, smashing the Arab fleets, smashing the Chinese
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.680]  fleets, smashing any fleets that got in their way, smashing any armies and the Republic
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:08.280]  was born out of smashing the British army.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:13.120]  Because we had the moral right and the King of England had to admit that George Washington
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.880]  was the greatest man in the world and he was the greatest man in the world.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.880]  He said, I don't want to be king.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.600]  By the way, I want to go back to my farm.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:25.240]  I'm sick of all this and that's why he was great for all of his exploits, all of his
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:27.800]  courage, all of his good luck, his providence.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.720]  I mean, that's why you aren't taught about George Washington.
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.280]  That's why they don't make movies about George Washington.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:37.480]  That's why they demonize George Washington is because they're afraid of the idea of
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:43.280]  honor.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:48.520]  And you know, we're sitting here looking at this as a society.
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:49.520]  I want to give out the toll free number.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:57.400]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:03.120]  If we believe we can defeat tyranny and if we have right on our side and if we take action,
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.080]  we are unstoppable.
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:09.120]  Of God before us who can be against us, it's been said many a time.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.800]  And the alternative is total slavery.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.920]  So I realize that 5% beat the greatest empire of the world I've ever seen.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:25.960]  We don't need the majority of the sheep that get together in big... all this establishments
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:26.960]  stuff.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:31.800]  They think they have power out of their sheepishness, out of their weakness and they do not count.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:32.800]  We care about them.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:33.800]  We don't abuse them.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.800]  We don't use their stupidity.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:35.800]  We abuse them.
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:36.800]  We're not predators.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:39.800]  But we understand that they are not our brethren.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.680]  May their change set lightly upon them.
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:44.080]  May they forget that we were ever related to them.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.080]  Let them go in peace.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.000]  May their change set lightly upon them.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:55.520]  As for me, I know not what course others may take but give me liberty or give me death
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:03.000]  because tyranny and slavery is death and I will not go willingly down to my knees to
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:09.920]  a bunch of sickos that wage war against health and against honor and against the family and
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.400]  against blessings.
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:19.800]  The God comes to build and give reproduction and wealth and beauty and honor and good things.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:30.160]  The devil and his pumps comes to give deception and lies and frauds to kill, steal and destroy.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:35.800]  And I'm here to tell you, I make the choice that I want to shine on to all the good stuff
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:36.880]  God has to offer.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:41.360]  I like all that stuff and here's the thing.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.160]  Evil is pretty to the purest heart.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.520]  It's been said by many a philosopher and it's true.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:53.320]  From afar it's so alien.
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:43:00.240]  It's the call of the city, the way that blacks pretty to the purest heart.
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:07.680]  It's places of pleasure that'll offer you treasure but only if you'll fall.
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:10.160]  Quote Rodney James Dio and I kind of butchered that.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:14.520]  You guys pull up the lines from neon nights for me and bring that into me.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:20.000]  Ride out protectors of the realm, captains at the helm.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  That's what this is all about.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.440]  Evil is a giant challenge.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.080]  The purest heart is the most tempted by evil.
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:31.840]  The purest heart is the most attacked by the world.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.400]  We're the conspiracy theorist.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:34.840]  We're the heretics.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:36.240]  We're the bad men.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.640]  We're the terrorists.
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.120]  We're behind the Boston bombing.
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:40.680]  We're behind the racism.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.120]  We're behind the bad economy.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.200]  We're behind Obamacare not working.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.200]  We're behind.
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:46.200]  We're behind.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.200]  We're behind.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:48.200]  We're behind.
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:49.200]  No, we're not behind any of it.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:52.040]  The world order is the author of this whole thing.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:59.000]  It's their signature that's on it.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.680]  By the way, I should give the phone number out after people hang up.
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:06.840]  You have a chance to call in.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:11.960]  Have you come into one of these illegal unconstitutional blood checkpoints where they take blood and
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:15.960]  saliva without a warrant, without even probable cause, forget even the alcohol probable cause
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:16.960]  now.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.040]  They just do it.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:25.880]  There's some mainstream news now under the feds, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:28.680]  Tell John Bown and them, just go to the use stream feeds.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.320]  We'll have that posted in the JFK section on Info Wars until the bottom of the next
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.320]  hour.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.400]  Then I want to do a live on the street with a big crowd lined up to give us their take
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.960]  on JFK from the Grassy Knoll and more from Groden if he wants to talk to us.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:40.960]  That's their directive.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:42.840]  I've got to also direct the crew while I'm at it.
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:43.840]  Thank you very much.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.160]  Tell them, go to use stream for everybody who wants to see that.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:50.600]  We'll get that up in the new JFK feed that's going up momentarily.
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:53.400]  Paul Watson will have an article out with places and times for other demonstrations.
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:45:00.400]  In fact, it just went live 10 seconds ago, JFK 50th anniversary, fight for free speech.
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.840]  We've got another graphic we're putting together of the Tiananmen Square tanks and tying it
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:09.720]  into Dallas that will be added to that article momentarily that Carter just put together.
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:14.520]  But there is John Bown's report last night from Dealey Plaza in high death if you want
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.520]  that.
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.720]  I'm proud of those guys getting up there and doing that late last night.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:20.000]  There's Paul Watson's report on it as well.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.280]  And we're going to be adding to that the live use stream feed at the bottom and links to
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:30.320]  the use stream channels for folks that want to get the live continual coverage there at
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:35.200]  infowars.com and prisonplotter.com, JFK 50th anniversary, fight for free speech.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:38.520]  We have the map going up as well.
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.040]  That's also in a Don Salazar's article.
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:43.760]  They want to add that of where the Federal Reserve Building is for eight o'clock tonight
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:45.280]  with that demonstration.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:55.440]  And then we're also going to then get two new maps of tomorrow's march and then Friday's
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:56.560]  key march.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:00.440]  The most important, if you go to one thing, it's that Friday, 11 o'clock, it will be
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:04.200]  five or six blocks away from Dealey Plaza, we're going to march up to the barricades
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:08.600]  to illustrate that the American people do not buy the fraud and the mayor's attempt
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:12.760]  with the feds and the offshore globalist to butcher free speech and to cover up who
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:19.000]  really murdered JFK has failed, will continue to fail and will totally fail.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:25.040]  So help me, almighty, heavenly, king of all hosts.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.160]  In the name of Jesus Christ, I have sworn on the altar of heaven to resist every form
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:35.880]  of tyranny over humanity and I pray that I be sanctified and purified against the evil.
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:40.080]  I'm not trying to be a preacher, folks, this is just what comes out of me when we get down
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:43.920]  to this point of evil in our country and what's going on.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.080]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me just mention what's coming up and we're going to
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.080]  play this video.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.320]  We'll do it at the start of the next hour, but I want to go to your calls right now.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.880]  Father arrested for trying to pick kids up from school.
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:58.920]  You don't need a reason as a parent to get your children.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:01.800]  They are our children.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.000]  And then we have the clip from MSNBC and the promo where they say your kids belong to the
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.060]  state and you show up, you don't want them to walk your daughters right out in front
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:11.060]  of traffic.
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:13.400]  You know, I'll just pick them up the door and they go, get back, get back, get back.
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:17.400]  And then they all knew him by the way, they're like, come on, Bob, and then they arrest him.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.160]  I mean, it's just like crazy.
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:20.160]  That's coming up.
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:23.560]  That's on infowars.com.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.960]  But right now let's go to your calls as promised.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:29.800]  Let's talk to Inder in Ohio, Inder, you're on the air.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:35.320]  Yes, Alex, long time, that's a handle, obviously.
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.200]  My name's Chuck.
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:45.480]  Everytime Prison Planet member, first time caller, I just think you have to call on the
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:50.360]  300 million people out here to do something just for a minute at the time of his death,
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:56.720]  whether they, I thought it was 1230, but maybe you said 12 earlier, which is it?
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:57.720]  Alex?
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:00.760]  Yeah, I'm sorry, that was cutting out a bit.
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:01.760]  Say that again.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.400]  I said it at the time of his death, was that 12 or 1230 on Friday?
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.400]  I think it's 1230.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:08.400]  I can look that up.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:14.920]  What I thought too, I thought you said 12 earlier, just for a minute at the time of his death,
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:20.200]  people could pull their car over to the side of the road and blow their horn.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:23.760]  People could talk to the people, if they're in the shopping center, they could talk to
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:29.440]  other people in the checkout line about how they're mad as hell and excuse me, mad as
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:30.440]  heck.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:36.520]  I agree with you, in fact, Bruce Willis told Vanity Fair after he saw my films, this is
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:39.240]  on record, link letter told the whole story and then a few months later it was in Vanity
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:47.000]  Fair, Bruce Willis said, look, the people that killed Kennedy are still in charge.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.160]  I'm no longer an establishment Republican.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:54.200]  I see now they control both parties, but I'm still a libertarian conservative, a constitutionalist,
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.680]  and that's exactly what we all are that love liberty, we're just freedom lovers.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.160]  Thomas Jefferson is called a liberal, I agree with everything Thomas Jefferson stood for.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:03.680]  So if that's a liberal, then I'm a liberal.
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:08.360]  And that's what it comes down to, is that this was a coup d'etat over our country.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:12.400]  And so everybody needs to say, I'm mad as hell, I'm not taking anymore.
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:15.400]  That was a coup d'etat against America and against our system.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:16.560]  You're absolutely right.
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:19.360]  Everyone should do that at 1230.
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:24.120]  Everybody should make a scene tomorrow because they're trying to foist their lie back on
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:25.120]  us.
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.200]  There's a tremendous potential in it.
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.040]  Usually when you have an opinion, there are only a few thousand or a million other people
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:36.200]  that have the same opinion, but there's 300 million of us out here.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:38.560]  We should start a deal on Facebook right now.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:44.760]  My big Facebook has got a half a million followers or likers or whatever you call it on the globalist
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:52.160]  platform to basically say, you know, expose the coup d'etat at 1230 tomorrow, speak out
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:55.120]  for JFK truth, let it be heard no matter where you are.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:57.160]  That's a great, fantastic idea.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.160]  Right.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.160]  Yeah.
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.880]  1230 Friday, 1230 Friday.
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:04.480]  Great points or anything else?
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:05.480]  That's it for now.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.000]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:15.040]  We're going to go to break and come back with Kevin, Mr. Bird, Maliki, Dennis and others.
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.000]  But here's the lines from neon night lyrics.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.440]  Oh, no.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:21.440]  Here it comes again.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.760]  I don't remember when we came so close to love before.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:24.760]  Hold on.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.000]  Good things never last.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  Nothing's in the past.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.400]  It always seems to come again, again and again, again and again.
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.920]  Cry out to legions of the brave.
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:35.560]  Time again to save us from the jackals of the street.
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560]  Ride out, protectors of the realm.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:38.560]  Captains at the helm.
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:41.040]  Sail across a sea of lights.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.840]  Circles and rings, dragons and kings, weaving a charm and a spell.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:49.560]  Bless by the night, holy and bright, called by the toll of the bell.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:54.080]  Heat angels, fast ascending, moving, and that's not the right one.
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:57.040]  There's another song I'm talking about has those quotes in it.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:58.040]  Definitely from poetry.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.040]  Hold your eye back.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:01.040]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.040]  Alex Jones here.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:06.600]  And I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patreon Supply.
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:11.680]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:15.200]  secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:20.960]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:23.320]  values as their fellow patriots.

[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:22.280]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:26.600]  They won't be treated all the same.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:34.800]  There'll be a golden letter reaching down when the man comes around.
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:39.480]  Well, the men and women of Liberty are coming to Dallas tonight, 8 o'clock, activist meeting,
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:42.720]  double protest of the Shadow Government Federal Reserve, Pearl Street.
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:50.240]  The map is up on infowars.com in Paul Watson's new article and I know it links through to
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:53.800]  Don Salazar's article, we need to add the map of Pearl Street and stuff to that now.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.280]  We're going to have two other maps of the other two demonstrations added in the next
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:02.280]  hour, JFK 50, the anniversary fight for free speech, I'm going to go back to Mr. Bird and
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:06.800]  others here in just a moment before I go any further.
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:11.480]  By the way, remember this is a listener-supported broadcast in this true alternative grassroots
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:17.680]  real media that can challenge the capital ships of the establishment dreadnoughts,
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:19.920]  the establishment decepticon media.
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:21.720]  We're actually giving them a run for their money.
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:26.880]  We're going to take over with alternative media the coverage and culture jam and be
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:30.000]  all over the enemy media.

[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  They're going to try to demonize us.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.920]  We will take that and defeat them.
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.640]  They're going to walk right into our political trap and we're just going to dominate with
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:43.440]  thousands of people handing out 30,000 flyers about the attempts to turn that facility into
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.440]  Tiananmen Square.

[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:51.000]  that there is a, I found out from one of my friends, his great-great-great-great-grandfather
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:58.400]  was part of the Manhattan Project, and he found out that there is a cure for AIDS, paralysis,
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.560]  and every mental health disease.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:05.560]  I'm also, you know, it's really, I don't know, I mean, I know there's a lot of treatments
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:08.600]  they're suppressing and a lot of deficiencies they're covering up, they don't even teach
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:12.800]  nutrition to medical doctors now, but I don't know about panaceas, I mean, tell me the magic
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:13.800]  panacea.

[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:21.280]  Star?
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:27.160]  I, I really don't have an answer, but I want to, I mean, this is-

[01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:58.720]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:11.000]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers?
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:19.920]  Well, so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:29.440]  Alex Jones the word is George W. Bush is basically as organic brain syndrome and early onset of
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:34.920]  Alzheimer's and that's the word from inside sources is also leaked in the media that he
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:38.440]  just sits in the bathtub all day well he was on Jay Leno show and it looked highly scripted
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:45.960]  like he had trouble talking so there you go feel sorry for him probably harm as a reporter but
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:54.840]  let's go ahead and go to Maliki Maliki in Ohio you're on the air go ahead hey Alex how you doing
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:01:00.600]  I'm doing all right go ahead sir Alex I have some critical info for you I want you to break
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:05.520]  down and I want your opinion on but first I must say that when I look at this lax shooting and
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:11.640]  all these others I can't help but be reminded of when you covered Mrs. Feinstein lovingly
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:16.600]  saying smiling at the camera saying more of these events will happen again do you remember that yes
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:21.120]  I was watching it live and was stunned by she goes there will be more and she smiles like a
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:27.120]  witch and their little tongue licks out and smelling the blood of dead children with pleasure you
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:32.720]  know snake smells with its little tonguey-wungy and and I think we should show her say that and
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:38.400]  then show the more mass shootings and then show the article where Bloomberg was primed the day
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:43.320]  before and put out the orders get ready for the next mass shooting so I mean clearly there's
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:49.480]  major scripting going on here I'd forgotten about that very good point yes well onto my
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:55.600]  main info that I want you to break down Alex I believe it was last Friday I could hear it in
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:00.240]  your voice when you're saying that we need to repent you know it's just a different tone in
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:05.160]  your voice that day and I'm a Christian myself and I think that was like two Fridays ago yeah
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:12.000]  yes yeah you know why that happens because sometimes I get I get really evil most time I'm
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.240]  really sweet and loving but sometimes I like I really you know I think we all do this get
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:21.760]  really rage-filled and really evil and and then I always repent when I felt like that it's it's
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:27.120]  I mean we all have it as different moods different mindsets no it's not like a true other personality
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:34.080]  but it's it goes into that realm yes and I feel the same way at times I'm a Christian myself and
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:41.240]  when we look at these 501cp churches and you know the courier houses of iniquity these
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:48.360]  devil tree operations yes the clergy response teams and the mega pastors like Rick Warren combining
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:55.120]  Islam and Christianity I had to ask myself why why is this happening why is mainstream Christianity
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:03:03.520]  falling away quote pastor Hague Jesus cross was not the son of God he was a Jewish rebel and an
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:09.040]  enemy and when I first quarter people didn't believe me I can play the clip he wrote a book
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:19.920]  saying Jesus is not the Messiah and Christians just like he was an enemy of Israel and was dealt
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:26.000]  with and I mean it's like wow these guys can get away with anything I'm sorry go ahead yes I'm
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:32.440]  pastor Hague and when I'm not preaching I'm in McDonald's commercials dressed up as grimace no
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:39.280]  outfit is needed sorry so I started the research why I'm a fake voice I can broadcast like in that
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:45.080]  kind of voice I'm Alex Jones almost like a thirst and howl the third voice mixed with an
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:50.280]  authoritative bridgeer I don't actually know people that know him my I'm not gonna say it I had
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:55.200]  family that I'm just not gonna get into it down in San Antonio but let's just say this
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:04:03.120]  pastor Hague is not what he seems I'm sorry go ahead it's kind of fun to talk like Hague go
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:08.320]  ahead make a point I'm sorry no that's fine so I started the research why is Christianity
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.600]  falling away like this mainstream Christianity does it not work being Hague yeah and who better
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:18.920]  to get that answer from than Jesus Christ himself he said in John 14 15 if you love me obey my
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:25.480]  command he said in Matthew 5 I did not come to abolish the law of Moses I came to fulfill it and you
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:32.080]  know Alex I mean Christianity came from the Roman Empire and they changed the seventh day which is
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:38.560]  God's Holy Day to Sunday Constancy the Emperor but Christ also talked about the Pharisees always
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:44.720]  overdoing the law making that a prison so that people get into so much legalese the church
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:48.080]  fractures into a million different pieces but I I hear what you're saying we shouldn't have

[02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:03.720]  i think about it and i am literally bouncing off the walls right now so it is very hard for me to
[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:09.560]  even uh because my wife had to go get a dental appointment early this morning so i i did the
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:14.600]  breakfast in the in the getting the kids to school because they go to a homeschool academy

[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:26.360]  too much coffee man like what happens when you combine too much coffee man from beavis and butt

[02:09:55.880 --> 02:10:03.480]  ago i don't know late 90s put me on uh wbcr 1470 and we're on another fine station in the area as
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.520]  well that we support and are on and we appreciate them it's all about getting the info out and i
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:16.120]  support that station as well but wbcr 1470 uh was a little station with hardly any ratings
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:21.720]  and after years of us being on there it got high ratings and that's a reason then suddenly all over
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:25.960]  tennessee we've been i think we're on like six stations in tennessee now that's pretty good for
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:38.120]  us uh in places like uh nashville noxville a bunch of places because of wbcr wbcr when i was on
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:46.840]  republic radio uh the original republic radio picked up my show it's got to be like 1998 something
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:52.440]  like that and then i the only other older affiliates were dr wolf god blessing he died a jewish christian

[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:58.760]  supporting them and i want to tell our national listeners you name it you don't hear a lot of
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:02.360]  this on the show but we're going to try to support our local affiliates even more we should do this
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:08.600]  more i'm just so busy and so crazy i point is they're absolutely essential 90 of our audience

[02:12:52.680 --> 02:13:04.360]  you we are taking donations at triple w dot truth radio dot tv by credit card we are in competition
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:13.720]  with a another buyer from chattanooga and to buy an existing fm and we've got till the end of the year
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:21.800]  to come up with the biggest down payment we can make to get in the game of reaching 80 percent
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:29.320]  of the population who listens to fm only and we appreciate your endorsing this effort and our
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:36.840]  faith was to uh because of liberty well absolutely but again i've seen this before we get on one
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:41.320]  station for four or five years and it ends up getting high ratings that changes the face of
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:47.720]  whole regions you helped us knock the door down in tennessee that's spread now into kansas into
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:53.640]  missouri and into oklahoma mississippi louisiana it's like a war and we didn't like limbaugh had
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:57.560]  hundreds of stations paid for up front to get him on then later they had to pay to get him but the
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:02.920]  point is he had big money roger ailes behind him and started fox news later we had little mom and
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:08.760]  pops like you so we stand with you in the great message of liberty uh mr groth john so so again
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:15.080]  tell folks how they can donate thank you mr jones uh you're exactly right you know it was i've
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:23.160]  gotten emails from people who work in atlanta or in birmingham or and uh have been driving through
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:31.240]  the area and would pick up your program and become internet listeners so hopefully you know we're
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:35.720]  going to be able to uh now you're one of the first big walls you were one of the first people
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:41.640]  to blow a hole in talk radio uh for us to enter i mean again you were right there that's why it's
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:48.760]  so great to talk to you helping this broadcast uh up front uh absolutely give us a breach over the
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:56.520]  wall so god bless you and your listeners yes they the the listeners you know are doing it
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:03.560]  they are we have over a hundred listeners that have made donations already we need
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:13.480]  2,500 listeners to make donations of 20 dollars um and as a minimum to reach the the threshold
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:22.520]  and uh we hope that uh you know we will continue to reach things reach the those who are listening
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:28.600]  for the truth and want to hear the reality of alternative news and regardless regardless it's
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:32.920]  so good to have a 24-hour station putting on nothing but liberty messages so it's not diluted
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:36.680]  regardless even if you're not able to raise enough money you can put it into the station put it
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:42.680]  into promotion and then it's a pure donation in the info war to a station that's been so faithful
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:49.640]  to liberty and i know through a lot of adversity mr groth john why we we have uh why we're going
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:55.160]  to the listeners and doing it this way uh mr jones because we've actually taken a quarter million
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:16:00.840]  dollars in capital from our studio building because we had a business plan to build our own
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:06.200]  tower instead of leaving one and we and the interest rates and the cost of the land worked
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:12.920]  out to where we can we were actually building 80 am tower five miles further into the population
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:18.440]  center of our service area to reach two towns that we haven't reached before with the local signal
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:23.720]  and so we've got a quarter million dollars invested in the fm stick in the am station only
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:30.520]  right now and that's why we needed the capital support of the listeners to extend our uh resources
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:36.360]  to be able to compete and buy the fm so that's right and and and folks won't spend money to get
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:42.040]  the message of liberty outward loss which they will this is an absolute war and so again give
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:47.240]  folks the website the phone number they want to call and donate it's uh truth radio dot tv

[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:51.800]  just wanted to touch on a few things uh if the second amendment is considered the teeth to the
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:25:00.040]  constitution i would consider the first the brain and the fourth the backbone and i want to
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:06.440]  repeat something here if you if you would mind no mind quote citizens may resist unlawful arrest
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:12.200]  to the point of taking and arresting officers life if necessary end quote plumber versus state
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:19.480]  136 ind dot 306 uh it and it was appealed in supreme court in the case john badell versus
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:26.680]  the us 177 us dot 529 now first foremost i want to say i'm not in any way shape or form advocating
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:31.960]  violence no but i mean if a cop wants to try to rape you you have a right to fight back until death
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:37.320]  and and they just had to pass another law explaining that in indiana and it's true and and i've heard
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:41.400]  our awesome police chief say it doesn't matter if a cop's wrong you got to let them do whatever
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:46.440]  they want and that's a madness i mean that's north korea i mean it's like obama is breaking
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:50.200]  all these laws they go well he's the president and it's not bad of the president does it well
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:57.800]  that's nixonian the the state is not god police are designated by an incorporated area of people
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:03.400]  under state law you hire professionals to do the work for you they are servants but now they're
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:11.240]  saying no we are the masters that has an ancient name it's called tyranny it's hey man brother
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:16.520]  and that's that's where all of this and i just uh what brought me to this was watching the uh the
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:22.200]  father being arrested you know trying to pick up the kids that maybe two hours ago and that it's
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:28.680]  that sort of thing that we need to stop allowing ourselves they're allowing to happen no that's
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:33.240]  why cops will walk up if you're 200 yards away from them doing a stop or something and they'll
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:37.880]  go turn your camera off and i'm like first amendment they're like i'll arrest you and you're like
[02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:43.400]  you really think you're god all right turn around you're going to jail well they got to be sued
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:49.720]  because it allows bad people to act like that when you don't stand up to them the problem is
[02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:54.600]  again most police i talked to are actually awake but they're trying to put all the bad ones in
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:27:00.040]  under federal training federal grants it's a very dangerous situation the very dangerous
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:05.560]  situation and the problem is and granted i i understand not trying to cause a problem or
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:08.600]  if you're trying to get somewhere you're not wanting to be held up sure but at a special
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:12.600]  i mean at a certain point you can't bend over anymore i mean bending over is only making things
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:17.800]  worse and allowing yourself to be kidnapped and put in jail and then go through the whole
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:23.960]  broken legal process to get you know compensation and get your lawsuit through you're still
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:27.560]  bending over and allowing you're right sure well here's the deal they're already coming for
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:32.280]  everybody's kids and the guns and that's going to start it it always does santa anna tried it
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:38.520]  it king george tried it and uh it doesn't matter if they get the majority of the sheep sit there
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:43.000]  and suck their thumbs they want to make all of us that produce their slaves that's why they
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:49.640]  list us as the enemy red-blooded hard-working we're the enemy and so it's like all right
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:53.560]  you know you really want a war you'll probably get one they'll blow stuff up to blame and
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:58.440]  honest have the moral high ground that isn't going to work anymore and and and look my whole issue is
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:04.920]  the average cop of the civil war kicks off is not the target if they don't corner you or whatever
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:10.520]  you know they corner you got to protect yourself that's the way it is it the bureaucrats the scum
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:16.600]  the corporate heads the people that did all this they're the ones they need to pay and they will
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:21.480]  pay when all of it comes down if they keep pushing it and and look i don't say that as a threat
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:27.560]  that's a historical fact and we take america back and they have nurenberg too i want all these people
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:32.520]  ferreted out of luxembourg and switzerland everywhere else and we're going to take them back here and
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:36.440]  give them jury trials and then we're going to take them out to public squares and we're going to
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.040]  hang them and their little necks are going to sit there and pop one after the other i probably
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:44.440]  won't be alive it'll be a long time from now a lot of us are going to get wiped out if we don't
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:49.480]  turn things around but if it goes to all this i know in my gut they are going to hang high and
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:54.360]  they know it too they are the worst criminals you can imagine is that what you were getting at today
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:59.960]  sir it did pretty much but it we've got to start standing up for it and and you know going and
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:05.400]  having the lawsuits and and you know like you said we need to speak out lawsuit get involved do
[02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:11.160]  everything we can show the civil war doesn't start we need to do everything we can but i'm
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:15.640]  telling you they're spoiling for a fight and we're not it's just like in lexington and concord here
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:19.800]  came the you know 10 to 1 british redcoats and local militia was there they were coming to
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:25.640]  confiscate the guns from the church where they kept them and they said look me paraphrase the words
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:30.600]  don't start don't fire first uh but if they fire and attack us let them have it because if they
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:34.680]  want a war they're gonna get one and the shot heard around the world happened when the redcoats
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:40.040]  said let out your guys we're gonna kill you lay them down they didn't lay them down so they fired
[02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:44.360]  and you know what they ended up defeating that group but a larger group got together and routed
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:53.080]  them and then the rest is history we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:25.080]  i want to get to this really serious article and then back to your calls and back to a report
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:29.320]  from john bound and rob jacob said on the streets at dealie plaza as they shut down more the areas
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:38.920]  father arrested for trying to pick kids up from school you don't need a reason as a parent to go
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:43.960]  get your children they are our children a father was arrested for attempting to pick up his kids
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:50.280]  from school in a startling new example of how the state is increasingly treating children as its own
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:58.360]  property making a stand against what he considered a dangerous and illegal new school policy that
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:05.480]  forces parents to wait in a line of cars outside until children are released at 235 p.m jim howell
[02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:11.320]  who want to go on the show guys tried to walk his kids out of south cumberland elementary but was
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:17.400]  arrested and now faces charges of disorderly conduct you don't need a reason as a parent to
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:23.000]  get your children there are children howell states in a video of the incident and again he's totally
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:28.280]  polite totally nice and the cop gets loud and says he's causing a problem the officer the god
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:33.560]  who made the arrest of the slave sheriff deputy and school resource officer avery eights
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.280]  responds to howell's attempt to pick up his own children by stating
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:47.000]  i'm going to call some help down here and we're gonna take you to jail right now i'm not putting
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:53.880]  up with this a day you're being childish and it's a call for the totally turning the schools into
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:58.760]  prisons folks social engineering that parents can't get near our little prisons they advertise them
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:03.640]  as mass shooting zones the school secretary attempts to get how to fill a form out to
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:07.400]  authorize the children to leave the school on their own which howell refuses to sign because
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:12.280]  he's escorting the children out of the school stating they're walking with me when schools
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:16.680]  dismissed per state law then they go ahead and arrest him the issue is this is why everybody's
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:20.360]  trying to home school so this is going to raise taxes where you can't afford to have somebody
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:24.200]  stay home and take care of the kids it's not that the average teacher even the average school cops
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:27.400]  a bad person they don't know they're in a social engineering system they haven't read all the
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:32.280]  government documents they don't know that it's actually run and approved by wacken hut and others
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:36.120]  to prepare kids for prison life they don't know that your kids are sent to school learn how to use
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:40.680]  drugs and have sex they don't understand the big picture of the social engineering but the global
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:45.560]  is thrown record the schools are meant to metastasize and take over the country where now schools go
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:50.120]  yeah the neighbors saw jimmy playing with an orange nerf gun in his backyard with friends
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:53.960]  they were shooting at each other with them with the nerf guns it's what you're supposed to do
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:58.040]  you know like when you go to laser blazer and play laser tag when they go call a swat team on that
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:03.160]  imagine they send some globalist socialist in and they go i saw people with ray gun shooting
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:08.600]  each other call the swat team i mean that's how but the school acts like it's normal oh yes we are
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:13.880]  shutting down you know billy out for two weeks and and then charging him with truancy because he had
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:19.720]  an orange and yellow nerf gun with bobby in the backyard it's like neighbors see a two and a half
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:24.440]  year old peeing and on the side of the house and they call the police on them and the cop arrest
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:29.400]  you know the dad or whatever i mean this is just like you see a little kid peeing in the yard that's
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:35.640]  what little kids do i mean i've had kids up to age four at the beach just start peeing in the water
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:41.720]  you go hey hey whoa you got to go back to the back to the hotel to do that and how many times is
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:46.520]  your other kids kids peeing in public they call the police people there was some woman two weeks
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:50.920]  ago was in a bar and saw people drinking call the police and said there's people drunk in here and
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:56.680]  the cops arrested her or my hamburgers not warm i'm calling the police on you let me make this
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:38:04.120]  clear the police are out of control the public is even worse it's pathetic and this father i mean
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:08.040]  this happens everywhere now where it's like a jail guard you gotta have an id you can't get your kids
[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:12.760]  and all the schools do this now they bring your kids out and then like shoot them out into traffic
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:18.040]  to pick them up even private schools do this now and it's dangerous so he didn't like that he wanted
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:22.840]  to pick his children up and he got arrested here is part of the video the full video is up on info
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:32.680]  wars.com do we have the video of the okay well that's all right the tricaster sometimes has
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:37.160]  little problems but as soon as we get that we have it queued up we'll uh we'll uh get that we
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:42.760]  haven't had that happen in a while and again uh this speaks to just what's happened in our culture
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:49.400]  what's happened in our society and and again the plan as MSNBC said is that the state runs your
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:54.440]  kids in fact Watson's article lists all this what california actually says your kids belong to them
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:59.720]  the feds are saying you're gonna have an assigned government uh social worker from birth even if
[02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:03.960]  you're wealthy even if you have no criminal record even if you're middle class you will have them in
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:10.440]  your life they will be their third mommy or daddy and they will teach your child how to you you know
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:17.560]  do you know what they're gonna teach your five-year-old how to um how to do you know what so that's
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:20.840]  just they're gonna do it and if you don't like it you'll be arrested so let's go ahead and go to
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:26.280]  the takeover of society by the social engineers by the parasites here is uh the clip now walk in
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:32.680]  with me when school is dismissed no we're not per state law yes there no you're really barking

[02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:36.680]  specificity behind the back okay we're going to open yourself up for a lawsuit i'm not standing here
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:43.000]  arguing to you that's what's been disorderly that's fine with me called a kind of picture and with
[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:51.240]  by the way that dad's been doing this for months trying to get his kids they'll keep him like 30 40
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:55.160]  minutes and make a walk through traffic right there he's tried to get it changed so he brought a
[02:45:55.160 --> 02:46:00.680]  camera in and documented all this and again they they make a law where the kids are in their custody
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:05.880]  as long as they want after school so he's pointing out so we'll just get the Tennessee law changed
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:11.800]  that's how this works this video will result in that law being repealed when the legislature's
[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:17.880]  back in session you can bet your bottom dollar and that's why we're going to Dallas to reclaim the
[02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:26.120]  first amendment because you're not taking any of our rights you degenerate control freaks oh my god
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:32.840]  this video makes me so here we go make sure you get the three three five no two five two five zero
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:38.120]  let's talk here
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:46.760]  what the officer officer they're not officers they're like servants of evil that's correct
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:53.880]  that's correct i'm a bureaucrat okay how would you camera do that thing whatever i want to oh look
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:57.560]  you get your camera i don't still talk to you can't
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:05.320]  you guys notice i can do this accent perfectly because uh that's how folks talk in east Texas
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:12.440]  okay there you go ladies and gentlemen he has oh excuse me sometimes it's a half an hour
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:17.800]  he has a special needs daughter i would guess from the vaccines they hold her an hour and a half
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:23.320]  crying in front of her peers and not allowed to call him so that's what it comes down to they
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:29.640]  have just been hammering this guy and you notice the cops like we'll get back whenever the hell we
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:42.920]  feel like a piece of crap what do you think this is america i love it i love the tyranny don't you
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:49.240]  let's talk to mike and mass you're on the air evil one go ahead hey how are you man i'm pretty
[02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:54.520]  angry after i watch that video again well i just had a couple comments on canady and the federal
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:48:01.480]  reserve um i i do have a pretty wild idea where we can stir up some uh the establishment and generate
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:06.200]  more awareness about the federal reserve but just real quick with kennedy i honestly believe
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:10.840]  regardless who did it whether it was criminal elements within the cia or military industrial
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:16.360]  complex or lbj i really honestly believe that the order probably came from within the federal
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:20.920]  reserve i mean if you look at it no i know he signed an executive order to begin phasing it out
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:25.240]  and he had been a hawk we found it was all a fraud that were funding the communist so he got out of
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:29.720]  that he said notice staging terror attacks to bring in martial law that's what we're protesting
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:35.960]  federal reserve eight o'clock tonight at pearl street downtown dallas be there it just seems to me
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:42.040]  until we can turn off the federal reserve's faucet which you know obviously brings us wars
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:48.200]  inflation the police state they just had a big federal reserve insider come out last week and
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:53.320]  say i apologize this is designed to transfer wealth offshore banks we're destroying america
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:59.720]  this is a total i mean why not they have a foreign tax to foreign banks and offshore banks with
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:05.720]  old bozo care i mean what do people expect now let me ask you this do you think this would be a
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:12.360]  possibility with pooling all your resources all your listeners facebook people youtube watchers
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:17.640]  and also the general public that's now waking up more and more do you think it would be beneficial
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:22.120]  to have a million man march on to the federal reserve well i mean i've been part of national
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:27.400]  marches on all of their 50 head branches and hundreds of sub branches and each time the media
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:31.800]  covers it it ends up being a national issue to identify them as the shadow government and that
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:35.240]  puts pressure on the bad elements of it because there are some people that work there that are
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:38.760]  higher level that don't want to destroy america who bought into its official mission that's not
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:42.840]  its real mission they've had the head of the dallas feds say we're under tyranny and they're
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:47.320]  destroying america they've had the kansas city fed do it those the two sounds like my show and the
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:52.280]  stuff they've been issuing because i mean it's not all evil people but it's evil at the top
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:57.480]  and so yes i think we should all have in the fed rallies all the time and we should push for a big
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:01.480]  one maybe coming up sometime in january or something so we have a few months to promote it
[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:05.720]  you know doing this impromptu real quick uh you know i don't know we need 300 people to show up
[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:10.360]  tonight each got 100 flyers to hand them out so folks know there's a violation of free speech
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:14.760]  what's happening with kennedy and so they know how to tune into my radio show tomorrow and the next
[02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:19.800]  day and the day after that friday uh so thursday and friday the next two days so people know the
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:25.000]  truth and can hear us broadcasting down there live and again it'll get the the the corporate media
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:29.080]  will definitely respond they're already responding because they still think they're in charge so they'll
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:35.960]  want to attack me and so that's an arena that i will proudly step into uh and absolutely slash
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:41.320]  them the pieces with the truth so i'm looking forward to absolutely uh gutting them on their
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:48.840]  own propaganda big time and their attacks on free speech only energizes our operation i'm afraid
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:55.240]  the people will be there when the establishment pimps arrived okay we'll be right back ladies and

[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:15.480]  was a high level what he did at the dallas fellow reserve and he would watch me on dallas access tv
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:20.840]  folks by like 1998 would take my tapes up there in eram every week kind of got syndicated on access
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:26.600]  tv before i even got syndicated on radio and uh he really got shook up by it and did research
[03:02:26.600 --> 03:02:30.760]  and found that it was all true and there he was a world war two naval veteran in the pacific
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:37.720]  great guy really funny uh billy pope uh and he never knew any of that stuff and before he died
[03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:41.800]  he came and visited me an awesome really smart guy he died the night of a stroke but he was sharp
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:47.480]  to the day died he said wow it's all true so he was just a really great guy uh let's uh
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:53.960]  and he survived by a sister so i saw four times last week you go see her some more uh let's talk
[03:02:53.960 --> 03:03:00.120]  to ray and iowa last caller sorry to all the others go ahead uh yes sir how are you i'm all right
[03:03:00.120 --> 03:03:06.760]  brother uh good to hear that listen i had a couple of comments on the uh fluoride comment
[03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:13.640]  content in the water and i wanted to mention when i was a kid growing up here in iowa my dad there
[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:18.520]  was this old boy that had been in world war two and he was a friend of my dad's he'd also been in
[03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:23.720]  korea holy cats he'd been shot full of holes like you couldn't believe but he he uh would come over
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:31.160]  and fill up buckets full of dad's well water and this we're talking like 1975 uh i believe in 1975
[03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:36.200]  ish and dad that's well you don't got no water over there and he said oh yeah well city water but
[03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:41.560]  it's full of rat poison and dad was like not well no you're absolutely mistaken it wouldn't do that
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:48.200]  of course and so while he called the next time he'd come over he had this can and it was sodium
[03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:53.240]  fluoride and it said caution danger had the skull and crossbones on it and he said this is what to
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:03:59.320]  put in the water for rat poison no that's right and they still use it uh even though the fda finally
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:03.960]  is all their scientists literally 90 plus percent revolted and so we're going to sue you if you don't
[03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:08.520]  they two years ago announced in the new york times that they've said phase it out in the next five
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:15.720]  years out of pesticide one of the main pesticides is fluoride dust sprayed on plants and then it
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:21.960]  bio accumulates on top of it so yes sir it is rat poison and it's a giant joke on all of us and
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:26.920]  they have the mainstream media make fun of us because we're aware of that so god bless you we're
[03:04:26.920 --> 03:04:31.160]  out of time great job to the crew and great job to our first reporters to get up there to work out
