[00:55.440 --> 01:04.120]  black people they're actually born and this is a model that is designed for everyone but blacks
[01:04.120 --> 01:10.600]  in this country are always targeted as the beta test for government drug dealing government run
[01:10.600 --> 01:19.120]  and controlled organized crime and gambling abortion police state operations and this of
[01:19.120 --> 01:27.360]  course gets into the heart of eugenics he's a very informed knowledgeable researcher and a
[01:27.360 --> 01:34.360]  pastor Leonard Howard Childress will be joining us coming up in an hour and 30 minutes from now
[01:34.360 --> 01:39.880]  then later towards the end of the show we're gonna have shooter Jennings on with us and we're

[02:02.120 --> 02:10.040]  anti-New World Order to the max so that is coming up in the last hour of the radio broadcast today
[02:10.040 --> 02:27.360]  all right I have all these stacks of important news here in front of me ten years ago maybe once
[02:27.360 --> 02:40.400]  a year I would be shaken with great understanding with deep focus with the ability to open up larger
[02:40.400 --> 02:50.200]  horizons and see through the eyes of the controllers and the last five years I began to have massive
[02:50.200 --> 02:58.120]  epiphanies or intensifying revelations of understanding from deep research every few
[02:58.120 --> 03:11.760]  months now in the last year or so it's been happening every week and now every day I wish to
[03:11.760 --> 03:22.160]  the bottom of my heart that the different control freaks and people on power trips that empower this
[03:22.160 --> 03:33.360]  system and we all empower it by our worldliness by our greed by the things we do all of us are to
[03:33.360 --> 03:41.720]  blame for the state of the world and there's different strata of the useful idiots up to the
[03:41.720 --> 03:49.320]  master controllers who are fully conscious of what they're doing there's a wide spectrum in that
[03:49.320 --> 04:05.360]  strata and through every level of that strata through that spectrum there are two different
[04:05.360 --> 04:16.120]  perspectives to each level and in my understanding I now sit mentally spiritually at the juncture
[04:16.120 --> 04:28.280]  point at the last level entering the last level of understanding and I have this mission and I
[04:28.280 --> 04:35.720]  want to fully understand the enemy's mind but now that I round the door into the inner gateway and
[04:35.720 --> 04:45.360]  begin to swim through the ether that is the spirit of the new world order so that I can warn you it
[04:45.360 --> 04:56.240]  shakes me to my core to be in their system to know their mind and to be diametrically opposed to it

[08:28.720 --> 08:36.960]  we have to go through the enemy picket line of the tyrants and all of their servants all
[08:36.960 --> 08:44.280]  of the wreckage of humanity some we can save some we can salvage some we can lift up to
[08:44.280 --> 08:50.200]  be great leaders but for many they have fallen to the spirit of our age to the spirit of
[08:50.200 --> 08:57.840]  the god of this world I wrote some notes right before airtime and when I start the next hour
[08:57.840 --> 09:09.480]  I'm going to break down each thought that went with these notes they want to be gods
[09:09.480 --> 09:17.440]  that is the fundamental nature of the controlling elite they want to control the weather they
[09:17.440 --> 09:22.160]  want to be able to track and trace in real time everything we do and most importantly
[09:22.160 --> 09:31.080]  predict human activity both the individual and the group the mob the civilization the
[09:31.080 --> 09:40.600]  billions of human sentient beings upon this planet that hurdles through deep space the
[09:40.600 --> 09:48.480]  controllers to succeed must blind us spiritually mentally physically they must drug us and poison
[09:48.480 --> 09:55.440]  us to dampen our awareness so that we don't challenge the architecture of what they are
[09:55.440 --> 10:02.720]  building and what they are near completing they must hurt us for their plan to succeed
[10:02.720 --> 10:14.120]  they study us to control us their great goal is to build a giant kill grid so that the
[10:14.120 --> 10:22.920]  elite of the planet can enjoy the life extension technologies the computing power that they
[10:22.920 --> 10:32.680]  interface with via the mega computers the technology bounty the life extension that
[10:32.680 --> 10:43.360]  is to be theirs and not ours the singularity they believe that you will not pass through
[10:43.360 --> 11:04.680]  it we must save our humanity we must value innocence and the truth we must have daily
[11:04.680 --> 11:12.440]  struggles with ourselves to not fall to the designs of this system we must realize that
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.920]  these simulated murders and torture and death that we are shown on television every day
[11:17.920 --> 11:25.920]  is meant to sear our conscience our mental nerve endings to where we don't recognize
[11:25.920 --> 11:31.840]  abuse and corruption when it happens to us or our neighbors the torture porn that fills
[11:31.840 --> 11:44.040]  Hollywood movies and television they train us to love our servitude to tribally identify
[11:44.040 --> 11:56.560]  with the trappings of weakness I also want to tell the establishment
[11:56.560 --> 12:05.640]  what your masters are building and 99.9% of you working for this system who are compartmentalized
[12:05.640 --> 12:12.680]  and don't see the full picture you're given false narratives false ledgers false playbooks
[12:12.680 --> 12:19.240]  like a script in your little section of the system to carry it out the lies you've been
[12:19.240 --> 12:24.640]  taught the petty power you've been given you need to know that you will be hurt and
[12:24.640 --> 12:31.760]  are being hurt by this system and many of you who think your high level controllers
[12:31.760 --> 12:41.720]  really aren't high level controllers in this new world order the planet is being prepared
[12:41.720 --> 12:49.000]  they're announcing all over every financial radio and TV channel from Bloomberg to CNBC
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.960]  to the Financial Times of London and the New York Times that a new order is upon us that
[12:53.960 --> 13:06.640]  the banks will save us in the next 16 months by establishing a new bank of the world that
[13:06.640 --> 13:18.080]  this new system which was publicly and openly engineered by the very people now offering
[13:18.080 --> 13:32.240]  us the solution we're told that this new system will save us when it's only an extension
[13:32.240 --> 13:38.400]  in the next phase of the system we've been living under for hundreds of years but they're
[13:38.400 --> 13:47.000]  now entering the final phase of this master program to put in their kill grid to fully
[13:47.000 --> 13:55.320]  bankrupt the nation states the sub political units the states within the states the regions
[13:55.320 --> 14:02.400]  to reorganize our lives under the so-called green economy that is a neo feudalistic form
[14:02.400 --> 14:11.560]  of slavery and out of that the police state and every form of surveillance and control
[14:11.560 --> 14:23.320]  will be expanded and the family will be fully destroyed we are all living in a giant psychopathic
[14:23.320 --> 14:40.000]  control freak experiment a scripted nightmare pageant and once you fully understand the
[14:40.000 --> 14:48.120]  controller's mindset in their program once you become fully conscious and aware of their
[14:48.120 --> 14:55.160]  dark logic of how they think of how they operate you realize that you knew from the time you
[14:55.160 --> 15:02.760]  were a small child that everyone deep down knows the lie and when you become awakened
[15:02.760 --> 15:13.920]  or more enlightened you then simply realize that you knew your whole life but the system
[15:13.920 --> 15:20.320]  laid out thousands of different lies thousands of different niches and different variants
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.720]  through which you thought you saw the exits and a way to escape escape from the lie that
[15:26.720 --> 15:34.720]  your subconscious is fully aware of your subconscious mind depending on what breakdown you study
[15:34.720 --> 15:41.800]  is hundreds if not thousands of times stronger than your conscious mind and all of you deep
[15:41.800 --> 15:49.400]  down know the truth of what I'm telling you today and so that you would become blinded
[15:49.400 --> 15:56.320]  to the tyranny and corruption and evil you have been acclimated you have been prepared
[15:56.320 --> 16:06.120]  you have been bathed in death in destruction in evil in avarice in insecurity in envy in
[16:06.120 --> 16:16.120]  lust so that you could be manipulated and controlled so the establishment could pull
[16:16.120 --> 16:24.960]  your chain and direct you in a giant stampede of humanity off of the precipice into the
[16:24.960 --> 16:35.280]  gaping mouth of hell on earth all the dictators of the last 6000 plus years and the mass murder
[16:35.280 --> 16:43.880]  and the killing and every major system in mesoamerica to central asia through the middle
[16:43.880 --> 16:52.920]  east and ancient western europe in every culture the elites demanded the first born to be sacrificed
[16:52.920 --> 17:02.600]  to their gods in every culture the elites practice the system of mind control and dumbing down
[17:02.600 --> 17:10.360]  and training the public to go against their basic human virtues until our civilization
[17:10.360 --> 17:21.120]  our cultures have become nothing more than hordes giant throngs of biological androids
[17:21.120 --> 17:38.000]  serving the master priest class of controllers i have seen the future i have seen it in the
[17:38.000 --> 17:47.720]  writings of the technocrats of the architects of doom but in many cases long before i read
[17:47.720 --> 17:53.880]  their internal declassified documents long before i read their own memoirs long before
[17:53.880 --> 18:02.520]  i see their designs on paper i had already seen it in my mind's eye by studying their
[18:02.520 --> 18:11.360]  system because the more pieces you get to the puzzle the more easy it is to recognize
[18:11.360 --> 18:18.080]  what pieces fit in the other shapes and then you discover that there isn't one puzzle there
[18:18.080 --> 18:23.400]  are thousands upon thousands of interlocking puzzles and your knowledge of this system
[18:23.400 --> 18:32.560]  will accelerate to the point of where you cannot even describe or properly articulate
[18:32.560 --> 18:39.720]  what is being built but you know out there you've seen it in your gut you know it and
[18:39.720 --> 18:44.640]  so i tell all the controllers and all the servants and all the people that passively
[18:44.640 --> 18:53.840]  give their power to the beast that the system will lie to you and tell you that you don't
[18:53.840 --> 19:00.920]  have the power to change it or that you've got to have some master skeleton key to unlock
[19:00.920 --> 19:05.840]  the system that you've got to fix it all by yourself overnight or there's no point in
[19:05.840 --> 19:14.720]  getting involved that is a lie simply changing your heart and asking the creator of the universe
[19:14.720 --> 19:21.920]  to lead guide and direct you and to work with you and to make you stronger and to make you
[19:21.920 --> 19:28.520]  a better person and to make you be more tender and to soften your heart then you will be
[19:28.520 --> 19:40.760]  formed into a vessel into a tool into a weapon against evil the elite are not guides but
[19:40.760 --> 19:48.840]  all of humanity is made in the image of god in the image of the creator look at what we've
[19:48.840 --> 19:56.800]  built and the establishment they know this and they understand it and the moment you're
[19:56.800 --> 20:04.320]  aware of that you can defeat them hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters

[23:58.480 --> 24:18.100]  eight six two two three seven let's not mince words we're in a real depression it's been
[24:18.100 --> 24:24.680]  engineered by design every top globalist is bragged that the banks have gotten more power
[24:24.680 --> 24:28.960]  their internal documents of goldman sacks and others are public in mainstream news that
[24:28.960 --> 24:38.200]  they've engineered this and they are bringing us into a deepening global crisis to set up
[24:38.200 --> 24:46.040]  their new bank of the world via the g20 where we will pay our taxes unto the private banking
[24:46.040 --> 24:50.680]  cartel directly to them they already control the issuance of currency and credit and the
[24:50.680 --> 24:57.680]  24 dominant nations and if we cannot identify them to the public as the source of our financial
[24:57.680 --> 25:03.880]  problems and the source of the globalist ill gotten power then things are only going
[25:03.880 --> 25:13.960]  to get worse i mean look at matt tiebe of rolling stone in the last year he's playing
[25:13.960 --> 25:18.680]  the part of a leftist has come to everyone's rescue admitting that it's all engineered
[25:18.680 --> 25:24.880]  and he's being hailed but that's being done so that he can betray people at the key point
[25:24.880 --> 25:30.560]  a headline wall street bailout hustle goldman sacks and other big banks aren't just pocketing
[25:30.560 --> 25:35.840]  the trillions we gave them to rescue the economy they're recreating the conditions for another
[25:35.840 --> 25:41.440]  crash there doesn't need to be another crash we're going quietly and slowly but it's picking
[25:41.440 --> 25:54.240]  up speed in to the night and all the real indicators of jobs being lost of unemployment
[25:54.240 --> 26:07.160]  being over 22 percent of factories shutting down that illustrates where we're going as
[26:07.160 --> 26:15.400]  a society and we know that we are really in a depression and that it is going to continue
[26:15.400 --> 26:26.000]  to degrade whether you watch bill gates or ted turner or patchari or von rupe brown it
[26:26.000 --> 26:36.040]  doesn't matter they all state over and over and over again that they must end this industrial
[26:36.040 --> 26:42.600]  society last night jason bermas had an amazing radio show i was listening to it here in the
[26:42.600 --> 26:48.280]  office and he was going over some bill gates video we posted at info wars dot com and prison
[26:48.280 --> 26:53.080]  planet dot com earlier in the week and paul watson's written a big article about it today
[26:53.080 --> 27:02.320]  at prison planet dot com bill gates use vaccines to lower population and in his speech he said
[27:02.320 --> 27:06.160]  we're going to give people more health care and vaccines and that will lower the population
[27:06.160 --> 27:10.720]  well according to all yardsticks that would actually increase populations of the vaccines
[27:10.720 --> 27:15.320]  weren't reducing fertility or outright sterilizing people and of medical care was actually helping
[27:15.320 --> 27:19.680]  people and of course folks don't know that bill gates his father headed up plan parenthood
[27:19.680 --> 27:28.360]  and bill gates is a huge eugenicist along with his wife and he put a graph up when he
[27:28.360 --> 27:33.920]  was giving a speech on stage up on the big screen saying we've got to cut human population
[27:33.920 --> 27:42.960]  we've got to get our co2 output down to zero ladies and gentlemen humans exhale what is
[27:42.960 --> 27:50.080]  it five and a half pounds of carbon dioxide a day carbon dioxide is a life giving gas
[27:50.080 --> 27:54.920]  but they're counting on the public not understanding that and after they've imploded the economy
[27:54.920 --> 27:59.920]  the only stimulus money a paltry some that they will give the public is for the feds
[27:59.920 --> 28:04.840]  and allied corporations that are given the money to come into your cities and levy giant
[28:04.840 --> 28:12.240]  taxes to take control of the energy production systems to then jack up the price of that
[28:12.240 --> 28:18.040]  energy to further enrich themselves and put themselves in even greater power position
[28:18.040 --> 28:26.680]  and to further degrade and bankrupt businesses factories industrial capacities and systems
[28:26.680 --> 28:32.120]  and then only select fortune one hundred are allowed to operate and china as the global
[28:32.120 --> 28:42.080]  has said thirty years ago is being positioned to be the dominant system on the planet because
[28:42.080 --> 28:47.880]  they accepted the one child policy they accepted the eugenics program in the secret treaty
[28:47.880 --> 28:53.880]  from nineteen seventy five now much of it declassified when george bush was the ambassador
[28:53.880 --> 29:02.120]  george harbert walker and they have now been put into the financial and economic and industrial
[29:02.120 --> 29:11.480]  and military position to now play their role in a false bipolar global system to force
[29:11.480 --> 29:19.000]  the rest of the world to adopt their systems of internet control oppression and eugenics
[29:19.000 --> 29:28.800]  they are the model and here's reuters today p.l.a. p.l.a. officer urges changing us dominance

[33:37.280 --> 33:44.560]  world over thousands of times they control our military they control our police they
[33:44.560 --> 33:51.640]  control the issuance of currency and credit so they need to get the nations in debt so
[33:51.640 --> 33:57.840]  that they can then have a pretext to take control of the population's wealth that they
[33:57.840 --> 34:04.480]  don't have in their hands but it's more than just land or property it's intellectual property
[34:04.480 --> 34:10.440]  it's more than that though it's about being able to dumb people down it's about being
[34:10.440 --> 34:16.240]  able to control the education system it's about being able to mold societies in their
[34:16.240 --> 34:28.160]  image it is such a blasphemous thing that the establishment is doing robbing people
[34:28.160 --> 34:36.480]  of true consciousness robbing people of the wonderment of controlling their own destinies
[34:36.480 --> 34:44.520]  doing everything they can to dumb people down and make them petty using scientific tried
[34:44.520 --> 34:54.320]  and trusted tools of sociology and anthropology and psychology marketing to do this but humans
[34:54.320 --> 35:03.360]  are wondrous creatures and for every action there is a equal reaction and humanity is
[35:03.360 --> 35:08.240]  responding in many different ways and countering the system but the establishment is using
[35:08.240 --> 35:15.240]  AI supercomputers they now admit what we knew was going on decades ago that they can track
[35:15.240 --> 35:20.320]  you with your cell phone by predictive programming and know 93% of the time where you're going
[35:20.320 --> 35:25.200]  to go what you're going to do before you even make the decision to do it they know where
[35:25.200 --> 35:30.160]  you're going to go on the web they understand what makes you tick they understand your deepest
[35:30.160 --> 35:38.640]  darkest secrets from the millions of choices you make on the internet and via cable and
[35:38.640 --> 35:46.160]  Tivo all of those choices are being logged and it's all being used by a scientific dictatorship
[35:46.160 --> 35:56.400]  to control you to be able to literally predict the future the establishment can now for all
[35:56.400 --> 36:03.720]  intents and purposes predict the future and what inputs that they put into media and society
[36:03.720 --> 36:09.160]  what the outcome of that will be and they understand they don't have true omnipresent
[36:09.160 --> 36:34.760]  power yet and they still make mistakes but every passing year gives them even more power
[36:34.760 --> 36:41.600]  I mentioned this article China PLA officer urges challenging us dominance from Reuters
[36:41.600 --> 36:46.840]  I'm going to go over that and break down China's place in the new world order of the next five
[36:46.840 --> 36:53.560]  minutes I wanted to get Steve shank of the J. Michael Stevens group up the website ifoodsdirect.com
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.840]  we have him on once a month because they are the best horrible foods company out there
[36:58.840 --> 37:03.280]  and I found them because I bought from a several different I guess three different places and
[37:03.280 --> 37:08.520]  didn't like the quality of the food or at MSG or it was from China this is recently made
[37:08.520 --> 37:12.680]  they make it new every day they're making it every month it isn't 10 years old or even
[37:12.680 --> 37:19.020]  a year old they have raw meals they have already prepared meals it's just you can't find a
[37:19.020 --> 37:24.040]  better outfit and you can't find better prices and they have some new specials they're announcing
[37:24.040 --> 37:30.240]  here on the show today in the website see foods direct.com and you know we're not revolutionaries
[37:30.240 --> 37:39.240]  here we are restorationist I want our bill of rights and constitution back and we don't
[37:39.240 --> 37:45.360]  fund our counter revolution against tyranny as most revolutionaries did in the past robbing
[37:45.360 --> 37:52.440]  banks or even our founding fathers robbing red coat pay wagons full of the gold and silver
[37:52.440 --> 37:59.600]  to be paid out to the red coats no we sell books and videos and food and firearms accessories
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.960]  we promote whatever I believe in we sell water filters so you stop drinking all the poison
[38:04.960 --> 38:11.040]  they put in the water and that's why I believe in eat foods direct I have their food in my
[38:11.040 --> 38:15.720]  garage and in my attic and I've bought it and given it to some of my family that didn't
[38:15.720 --> 38:20.480]  have money to get it and this is what I believe in and my main reason for getting the food
[38:20.480 --> 38:25.520]  is the economic situation the globalists want you dependent they want you destitute they
[38:25.520 --> 38:30.320]  can make all the paper in the world instantly worthless overnight and they're definitely
[38:30.320 --> 38:34.960]  moving in that direction so I believe people should get storeable foods let's go to Steve
[38:34.960 --> 38:41.640]  shanks to have you up with us I like to be aboard and when you're talking about the attacks
[38:41.640 --> 38:47.760]  that are on a psychologically emotionally physically and and with all of the sociological
[38:47.760 --> 38:52.360]  statistics and things that they've developed over the years what folks have to realize
[38:52.360 --> 38:57.760]  is that the first attack and the constant attack is on our food supply the additives
[38:57.760 --> 39:00.960]  and preservatives and things that they're putting in the food the genetically altered
[39:00.960 --> 39:07.080]  stuff is in fact dumbing people down in every major study they know all the GMO we're eating
[39:07.080 --> 39:13.080]  kills and mutates and hurts every lab animal they feed it to absolutely and so that's why
[39:13.080 --> 39:20.000]  we develop this new line of product that that is just going absolutely crazy we've completely
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.840]  eliminated all of the garbage in the food even the hydrogenated oil which people don't
[39:25.840 --> 39:31.000]  even realize what it's doing to them but the fact is that we have stories every day about
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.920]  people that are I have serious health issues that are resolved with them now I don't know
[39:36.920 --> 39:42.960]  what's happening I know you mentioned earlier that the human is the most phenomenal being
[39:42.960 --> 39:48.400]  on the planet and the fact is that the human body can heal itself if it's just given a
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.240]  chance this food is just phenomenal but I've got to tell you what we're doing right now
[39:54.240 --> 40:00.600]  is is I've got to announce this Alex and and your show is the first place that we're
[40:00.600 --> 40:06.520]  turning it loose to the public for your listeners that are remotely aware of the importance
[40:06.520 --> 40:12.880]  of food what we've done is we've set up a block shipment that we're putting together
[40:12.880 --> 40:19.680]  if folks will order these foods before March 22nd in other words order from now through
[40:19.680 --> 40:24.800]  March 22nd that we were going to do a major production we're going to shut down all operations
[40:24.800 --> 40:30.360]  and do nothing but produce the food that people have ordered ahead by doing this we've been
[40:30.360 --> 40:36.720]  able to put together a savings that's never been done before if folks will order three
[40:36.720 --> 40:42.200]  of any of these packages that we have listed on this program they'll get another one absolutely
[40:42.200 --> 40:48.040]  free that means that they order three three month supplies from this new food they're
[40:48.040 --> 40:53.000]  going to get three months worth of food free and make up their complete year so they're
[40:53.000 --> 41:02.640]  going to be able to save anywhere between $69 and $749 on these orders it's order three
[41:02.640 --> 41:07.880]  get one free and this is the most phenomenal thing that has ever been done and the only
[41:07.880 --> 41:12.160]  way we can do it is just because of this tremendous response that we've had what they've got is
[41:12.160 --> 41:16.920]  food is better than anything on the planet including the groceries they buy themselves
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.000]  and try and cook themselves is cheaper than those groceries is health food that's put
[41:22.000 --> 41:28.000]  into a form that they can get their hands on and the meal sizes are all double meal sizes
[41:28.000 --> 41:36.360]  so this is this is the most phenomenal innovation in food that has ever been created here in
[41:36.360 --> 41:42.200]  this country or anyplace else and it's at a time when people they're only defense you
[41:42.200 --> 41:46.360]  see you know we can make them aware of all the stuff that's going on that they can't
[41:46.360 --> 41:49.800]  do anything about they can't do anything about the executive orders that are taking
[41:49.800 --> 41:54.200]  where their freedoms but what they can do is they can defend themselves from the most
[41:54.200 --> 41:59.480]  basic attack that is being perpetrated against the American public and that's their food
[41:59.480 --> 42:04.640]  supply if they own their own food that they'll never have to stand in a bread line to get
[42:04.640 --> 42:10.040]  bread and give up their freedoms in order to do it so that's what we're doing this is
[42:10.040 --> 42:15.080]  a three for one in other words if they order three of these packages all they have to do
[42:15.080 --> 42:23.360]  is get up on eFoodsDirect.com and slash Alex eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex and they'll show
[42:23.360 --> 42:29.960]  the Alex Jones special order we're putting together and if these folks will get on there
[42:29.960 --> 42:35.320]  order these foods for every three that they order we're going to send one absolutely free
[42:35.320 --> 42:40.720]  that means to put in a year supply of this food all they have to do is buy nine months
[42:40.720 --> 42:47.120]  worth and they get the other three months absolutely free this is just absolutely exciting
[42:47.120 --> 42:51.320]  and the reason we've been able to do it Alex is just the volume production that we're doing
[42:51.320 --> 42:56.000]  by by completely shutting down the plant for a week and producing all of these so they're
[42:56.000 --> 43:00.240]  going to have to wait till the end of March to have it shipped but I tell you what you
[43:00.240 --> 43:06.760]  will not find a better opportunity to jump start or get in and expand the food supply
[43:06.760 --> 43:11.240]  that you're going to need here within the next two years absolutely let me let me give

[44:04.600 --> 44:11.640]  the US is a captured region of the world by the offshore banks that put tax incentives
[44:11.640 --> 44:20.000]  in and use the unlimited capital they had to move almost all production to the third
[44:20.000 --> 44:26.800]  and developing world predominantly China and so they've positioned it where China owns
[44:26.800 --> 44:32.320]  the majority of our debt China has most of the factories where our cars or the parts
[44:32.320 --> 44:39.240]  for our cars and alarm clocks and CD players and wagons and tractors just everything and
[44:39.240 --> 44:44.840]  then now they're coming into the United States Europe England Australia New Zealand a few
[44:44.840 --> 44:51.560]  other Western nations and saying we're going to slap giant increases on energy to you we're
[44:51.560 --> 44:55.600]  not going to let you build new coal plants we're not going to let you build new nuclear
[44:55.600 --> 45:01.240]  reactors you know the US will build three China's going to build a couple hundred making
[45:01.240 --> 45:09.960]  it through through societal engineering and industrial engineering impossible for us to
[45:09.960 --> 45:16.320]  compete they've captured China they brag on MPR and all these fake environmental forums
[45:16.320 --> 45:21.720]  and publications that oh isn't the depression great isn't the recession great it's making
[45:21.720 --> 45:27.680]  us lower our carbon footprint we're a bunch of greedy Americans we're going to be taught
[45:27.680 --> 45:33.160]  now and they sell the end of property rights the end of the right to commerce the end of
[45:33.160 --> 45:39.200]  the right to contract they have unelected regional boards doing whatever they want in
[45:39.200 --> 45:45.120]  Austin alone they're set to pass it sometime this month two point six billion in taxes
[45:45.120 --> 45:51.720]  on energy alone in the first three years that's Austin energy paid to companies run and controlled
[45:51.720 --> 45:56.720]  by the communist Chinese and Al Gore and others that's on our local news Al Gore owns part
[45:56.720 --> 46:05.240]  of this company the second biggest solar manufacturer in China is moving to Austin and it's going
[46:05.240 --> 46:11.200]  to be tax-free on the land and the property taxes again this is the dominance they get
[46:11.200 --> 46:14.720]  us under the thumb of foreign corporations then they come back in and we work as their
[46:14.720 --> 46:25.040]  third world slaves and through all the so-called green jobs it's selectively given to certain
[46:25.040 --> 46:33.320]  companies and groups the United States under Clinton and then Bush and now Obama gives
[46:33.320 --> 46:38.440]  our most advanced military and scientific developments that we pay for as taxpayers
[46:38.440 --> 46:43.000]  through DARPA over 90% of all research on universities paid for by the government so
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.240]  they control it do they develop it and deploy in the US no it's given to China it's given
[46:48.240 --> 46:53.960]  to India it's given to Mexico China should build the world's strongest military and
[46:53.960 --> 47:00.480]  move swiftly to topple the United States as the global champion a senior Chinese PLA
[47:00.480 --> 47:07.080]  officer says in a new book reflecting swelling nationalist ambitions the call for China to
[47:07.080 --> 47:15.920]  abandon modesty about its global goals and sprint to become world number one that's
[47:15.920 --> 47:24.480]  a quote and sprint to become world number one comes from a people's liberation army
[47:24.480 --> 47:30.640]  PLA senior colonel they had a top general say this two weeks ago Lou Ming Fu who warns
[47:30.640 --> 47:36.800]  that his nation's ascent will alarm Washington risking war despite Beijing's hopes for a
[47:36.800 --> 47:41.760]  peaceful rise meanwhile you read the CFR and the globalist they've been rigging this the
[47:41.760 --> 47:46.360]  whole time but the globalists have to have the illusion of two different power structures
[47:46.360 --> 47:50.960]  so they're going to play China and the US off against each other oh we've got to give
[47:50.960 --> 47:55.600]  up good our freedom on the internet because the Chinese may attack it meanwhile the government
[47:55.600 --> 48:02.080]  lets them buy all our debt and sends all our industry there oh Chinese might try to sell
[48:02.080 --> 48:09.800]  drugs in the US we've got to have a police state China's big goal in the 21st century
[48:09.800 --> 48:17.840]  has become world number one the top power Lou writes in his newly published Chinese
[48:17.840 --> 48:24.080]  language book the China dream if China is the 21st century cannot become world number
[48:24.080 --> 48:33.160]  one cannot become the top power then inevitably it will become a straggler that has cast aside
[48:33.160 --> 48:40.040]  rights Lou a professor at the elite national defense university which trains rising officers
[48:40.040 --> 48:47.280]  his 303 page book stands out for its boldness even in a recent chorus of strident Chinese
[48:47.280 --> 48:54.600]  voices demanding a hard shove back against Washington over trade oh yeah it's not enough
[48:54.600 --> 48:59.200]  that they give people tax free incentives to move out of the US to bet human rights and
[48:59.200 --> 49:05.920]  arms sales to Taiwan but see the same big banks own and finance the Chinese weapons
[49:05.920 --> 49:10.400]  system and the US weapons system it's like the Rothschilds 200 years ago would fund both
[49:10.400 --> 49:16.280]  sides on record in Europe and everybody builds up these big forces goes into debt to these
[49:16.280 --> 49:25.000]  people the self-ruled island it continues the 303 page book stands out for its boldness
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.480]  even as a recent chorus of strident Chinese voices demands a hard shove back against Washington
[49:31.480 --> 49:37.040]  over trade to bet human rights and arms sales to Taiwan I mean they give them just useless
[49:37.040 --> 49:44.280]  stuff the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own as long as China seeks to rise
[49:44.280 --> 49:50.000]  to become world number one then even if China is even more capitalist in the US the US will
[49:50.000 --> 49:57.000]  still be determined to contain it writes Lou rivalry between the two powers is a competition
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.920]  to be the leading country a conflict over who rises and falls to dominate the world said
[50:01.920 --> 50:08.440]  Lou to save itself to save the world China must prepare to become the world's helmsman
[50:08.440 --> 50:13.680]  that's the person at the wheel of the ship the China dream it does not represent government
[50:13.680 --> 50:21.080]  policy which has been far less strident about the national goals Lou's book testifies to
[50:21.080 --> 50:25.160]  the homegrown pressures on China's Communist Party leadership to show the country fast
[50:25.160 --> 50:30.400]  economic growth and translating into greater sway against the West still minor economic
[50:30.400 --> 50:35.640]  slowdown yeah the same banks that Rob does transferred the money to China that's where
[50:35.640 --> 50:41.240]  Maury strong and all the UN scum moved to and they are total new world order pushers
[50:41.240 --> 50:46.040]  total collectivist they love the top down system and they've been promised the number
[50:46.040 --> 50:51.560]  one seat in the new world order you be sure of that north comes in the US will just be

[1:03:50.600 --> 1:04:10.600]  here's another deceptive headline out of the washington times american reliance on government at all time high and the article says oh sure only 8% of the public in polls like the government and think the government's for their best interest but we have record amounts of money

[1:09:50.600 --> 1:10:19.600]  knowledge of the hyper advanced technologies in weapons cybernetics life extension from the public simultaneously outside the technological fortress keeps the establishment sees the human race and all the films they fund and the books they put out and the materials they push as a disease
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:40.600]  as a infestation of mold or some type of sapien vermin that have to be exterminated the roll out of Monsanto and others in the last 15 years of genetically modified wheat corn soybeans and other key crops in every major study
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:54.600]  shows that it's attacking the organs of the lab animals that it's fed to simultaneously we see the honey bees that feed off these crops becoming sick and dying in major studies by universities and even governments
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:11:21.600]  simultaneously we see massive rollout with every major food crop converting to GMO the GMO is very aggressive and in every case infects and takes over the genome of the natural varieties of soybean corn wheat sugar beets the list goes on and on
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:40.600]  the water supply has hundreds of deadly chemicals put in it under the name fluoride fluoride alone attacks every organ precipitates in the bones and the pineal gland causes infertility cancer bone fractures death and farm animals that drink it it's all
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:12:00.600]  intensifying autism from one in 25,021 years ago to now one in 68 you hear PSA saying one in 150 that's a three year old number they are brain damaging us they are killing us they are soft killing us they are just incrementally
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:20.600]  implementing it or suddenly a third of the kids in your neighborhood have cancer or autism where young people are dying everywhere of cancer they start using depleted uranium everywhere the troops come home and die it's all kept very quiet the troops take
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:38.600]  incremental vaccines and get sick and die in many cases it's all kept very quiet binary weapons soft kill weapons incremental weapons that take time to build up cancer viruses going back to the 1950s now declassified that they knowingly
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:57.600]  took out the genetic stock from green and monkey and Reese's monkey kidneys to grow it they selectively took out the SV 40 cancer virus and according to declassified US government documents in the first wave 98 million people in the 50s were given it
[1:12:57.600 --> 1:13:16.600]  and contracted it tens of millions of them died in the next wave over 200 million were injected with SV 40 that then implants its RNA in the cell walls causing hundreds of different rare cancers that are no longer rare
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:35.600]  every major vaccine stock company that's had their vaccines tested this has been in mainstream Indian news mainstream African mainstream European news that they find the cancer viruses even when the cancer viruses are not supposedly part of the manufacturing process
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:55.600]  for five years most meet you by at the store has been sprayed with live viruses that supposedly kill E. coli they grow these in giant tanks filled with other viruses the viruses are then tens of thousands of times stronger than what this these viruses naturally occur in the
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:14:15.600]  stomach Crohn's disease and other autoimmune disorders of the intestines upper and lower and stomach are exploding and it's only going to incrementally get worse and worse and worse simultaneously they're using the phony environmental takeover that the banks are openly funding
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:31.600]  to ensure that no economic development is allowed that entrepreneurs are not allowed to reverse the depression we're entering that we are meant to never leave a new way of life where our standard of living drops day after day week after week year after year
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:51.600]  decade after decade generation after generation Ted Turner Bill Gates all of them the United Nations morey strong ahead climatologist at NASA all state the green revolution is really a eugenics revolution to shut down industrial development
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:15:09.600]  except in select government and corporate reservations Singapore one of the most dominant where high technology systems are developed and then deployed for the gain of the elite for the detriment of the people
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:25.600]  separately off of your digital cable boxes Teavos shell phones computers and then where you work is all wired into computers everything is being tracked RFID the Pentagon reported in 2002 is going into all of the products
[1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:41.600]  part of a Pentagon plan this is all public to track everything in real time just like you can use a search engine like Google to search the web in real time this will then off of radio readers being put up nationwide and worldwide they call it smart
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:16:01.600]  smart skin and smart dust track everything in real time on the planet and a three dimensional map but that is not just meant to track you that is a useful byproduct the tracking is really about predicting individual group subgroup and mass movements
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:23.600]  decade plus ago they confirmed that off of cell phone tracking records they could predict over 90% of the time where you were going to travel weeks ahead off of predictive psychological algorithm basically thumbprint it's a signature a wavelength a mindset a habit
[1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:39.600]  now they can predict it much higher levels than that where you're going what you're doing what your taste are off of millions of different choices that you've made that in the aggregate they're able to scan and track using supercomputers and this is what we know they have
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:55.600]  and clearly they're 20 to 30 years depending on the technological system more advanced and it may even be worse than that that's why they're so arrogant the future belongs to them they believe they believe they are achieving godhood in all of their
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:17:13.600]  own documents in all of their own manuals and memos and they believe you are not enlightened enough to travel to the next level they believe and they throw it in your face in 2001 space Odyssey and before he died he talked about it some
[1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:31.600]  Arthur C. Clark technologist to the elite the inventor of the communication satellite they love to give you a little parable so you understand that you notice the computer kills everybody and tries to kill the final astronaut on its travel out to the stargate at Jupiter
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:47.600]  this is what the elite believe and there's that final contest between man and machine the elite don't even consider you in the contest the elite are tracking their AI computers they're having debates with these systems they believe they're already sentient
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:18:07.600]  and self aware and they are moved on past humanity to how they want to merge with the computers and become a new life form as part of evolution this takes social Darwinism to a completely different level so while you're sitting on this planet with gorgeous oceans
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:25.600]  and rivers and streams and forest and flowers and different life forms all around you and every cell in your body is more complex than the biggest supercomputer while all this beauty and wonderment goes on around you all this evil and corruption and greed is going on the greed to dominate
[1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:45.600]  and knowledge is going on around you and while you care about the red socks and the Dallas Cowboys while you care about wrinkles on your skin while you care about how much sex you're having and all these petty things the establishment is completely moved on to controlling the future for their progeny
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:19:11.600]  and they're setting up a system where they will compete with each other into the next phase trampling and being trampled on it is a completely sadistic psychopathic mindset and spirit that has been released you are already seen as losers you are already seen
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:37.600]  you are defeated you were already accepting the soft kill operations being run against you and your family or your petty paycheck for the signants of power whether it's your police uniform or your corporate suit or your petty power as a McDonald's manager you are looking down into the dirt looking down at your feet while the entire universe opens up around you
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:20:01.600]  if we can trigger an emergency awakening in the human species which has always been the biggest threat to the elite and it looks like it's beginning to happen we can reverse this address the globalist as equals and have an open debate but if you can't even get past the first level of their denial that any of this exist you can't have a discussion

[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:09.600]  don't worry this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:20.600]  I fell into a curtain ring of fire I went down down down and the flames went higher and it burns burns burns
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:30.600]  the ring of fire the ring of fire and it burns burns burns the ring of fire
[1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:43.600]  the taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours meet I fell for you like a child oh but the fire went wild
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:53.600]  when you study the mindset of the controllers you understand that they want to be gods with their predictive computer systems where they can predict
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:59.600]  individual and mass movements of people with unbelievable precision
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:04.600]  decades ago it was declassified that they were involved in massive weather modification
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:23.600]  and like you're a child every time you say hey what are you doing they say that doesn't exist sunny meanwhile they publish it in literally thousands of reports and the White House Science are talks about it and Bill Gates patents all these different weather control systems
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:38.600]  they're playing God ladies and gentlemen they want to be gods over this planet they want to decide who can breed who can have children who can't they want to fully physically genetically take control of human society what we know about these GMO crops
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:44.600]  and the chemicals they're adding to our food and water is they're actually altering our DNA right now
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:56.600]  this is a bunch of mad scientists playing God and so I want to challenge everyone out there to not believe me to research this for yourselves and then decide
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:11.600]  do you like what the globalist are building do you want to be part of this do you think you're gonna get something out of this because all the evidence shows you're not this is a horrible dehumanizing very dark system that's being built
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:24.600]  the globalist always say they do what they do to help humanity but in their view they're helping you by killing you and then they've got this received knowledge of all the want to be establishment types anybody who's basically gone to college
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:34.600]  doesn't know why they think this they've just been programmed that well there are too many people the earth is dying we've got to get rid of them don't you understand you fool you're being attacked
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:45.600]  the globalist kept the third world from industrializing because that would have economically threatened their hegemony sixty years ago their monopoly of power
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:57.600]  and so they actually cause their numbers to explode and are now moving about exterminating them and that was talked about in nineteen nineteen forty nine and the royal commission put out by the British government
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:10.600]  oh we can't just poison and kill them now because we'll actually use a people bomb but not let them have industrial technology to tie them down and then later we'll just get rid of them
[1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:25.600]  see they always control both sides of any equation isn't it's an evil alchemy a evil logic a very very dark system because they don't care about humanity they don't play by any rules they do whatever they want
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:36.600]  they are beyond good and evil in their own words I don't believe they're beyond good and evil they tell you there's no good and evil so you don't have a political or sociological or spiritual rudder
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:51.600]  so you have no compass so they can just make you a petty insecure narcissistic fool who sits on the sidelines of human development so they can control where this ship of humanity goes
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:28:04.600]  they control who you think you are who you think what your destiny is they set your parameters they set your goals for you they lay out what they're doing in your face
[1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:16.600]  they build the technological grid to track and trace and predict what you're going to do and to understand your deepest darkest secrets
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:22.600]  and for the globalist world government is only the beginning of their kill grid and they're very close to having it in place
[1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:30.600]  I was on talk sport national British radio last night they said isn't global government just the next step in human development I always love that line
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:50.600]  as if humanity would just grow into one group loving each other no it's one group under a scientific tyranny that's been built by stealth that has a horrible eugenics genocidal plan at the end of their program
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:29:03.600]  no it is not natural for humans to all want to be under one culture or one government it's not natural for children to take Ridlin and Prozac 20% of them in this country
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:14.600]  it's not natural to have police checkpoint searching everyone it's not natural to have cameras watching us it's not natural to have school districts come out in the open and say yeah we're watching you at home on your computers big deal
[1:29:14.600 --> 1:29:27.600]  they think nothing of you they think you're ready to accept it they know people are waking up so they're coming in with a flood of tyranny hitting us from every angle
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:37.600]  to try to batter us into total submission but remember they're not gods they're not all powerful they wouldn't be trying to drug you and poison you and dumb you down
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:50.600]  if they weren't afraid of the incredible humanity that is in your soul of all the strength of your ancestors and their trials and those genetic memories that we carry on with us today to defeat this evil
[1:29:50.600 --> 1:30:00.600]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:30:00.600 --> 1:30:09.600]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:20.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:32.600]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:41.600]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:52.600]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com

[1:33:00.600 --> 1:33:08.600]  nearly four decades after abortion became legal a woman's right to choose continues to anger millions of Americans
[1:33:08.600 --> 1:33:13.600]  pro-life advocates regard abortion as the killing of an unborn human
[1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:26.600]  but according to pastor clenard childress rovers wade doesn't just target baby the new jersey reverend says the supreme court ruling is being used to wipe out an entire race of people
[1:33:26.600 --> 1:33:35.600]  pastor clenard howard childress thank you for joining me thank you for having me I understand that you are the founder of a pro-life website called blackgenocide.org
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:47.600]  yes why did you start this website well when I heard the disproportionate amount of african-american women that were falling prey to the abortion industry
[1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:59.600]  and knowing indeed that abortion had now had become very much a part of the decision making african-american women were making or doing
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:11.600]  the numbers staggered me and so african-american women make up 12% of the population but 36% of the abortions
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:21.600]  and for every at this present time for every two african-american women to get pregnant one will choose to abort
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:30.600]  52% of all african-american pregnancies end in abortion and that's from alan gutmocker who sat on the board of Planned Parenthood
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:39.600]  so these are statistics that should cause anyone concerned and thus blackgenocide.org
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:48.600]  why is it that you believe these women are victims of a system rather than making decisions on what they want to do
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:35:05.600]  no doubt the abortion industry targets african-americans minorities 78% of all of Planned Parenthood's abortuaries I call them but clinics are located in minority neighborhoods
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:15.600]  the targeting of african-americans has now been documented so we have to look at the abortion industry and look at the philosophic views
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:26.600]  and minorities is something that they want less of. Ruth Bader Ginsburg made the comment at the time rovers his way was decided
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:43.600]  we believe they were trying to get rid of populations that we don't want too many of. She made that comment July 11th 2009 and today of last year
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:53.600]  today we're seeing that rovers his way was not decided based on law but based on ideology.
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:36:08.600]  Just to clarify you're saying that abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood are purposefully trying to unleash genocide on the african-american female community
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:10.600]  that is their intent.
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:23.600]  Well yes if abortion was not lucrative it would not be legal. There's no question that Planned Parenthood the leader of the abortion industry in this country
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:33.600]  they account for 18% of all abortions and when you look at the abortion leader and you look at their ideology and their philosophy and their roots
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:48.600]  and see where all their abortion clinics are located in Houston right now they're building a mega. It's an enormous building in the african-american neighborhood
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:59.600]  and Hispanic designed for completely abortion their marketing abortion not women's health care their marketing abortion
[1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:08.600]  and many people need to know on that building in that building there's a floor dedicated to late term abortions
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:18.600]  and I want America to know late term abortions are still going on in this country and so we have to understand that the ideology the
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:26.600]  philosophic views of the eugenics movement was to target african-americans and they're still being targeted today.
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:37.600]  Planned Parenthood provides other services other than abortions for the patients that go there to the clinics and all their patients are not black women
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:45.600]  they have women that are of all race or religions all ethnicities. What do you say about all the white women that get abortions?
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:56.600]  Well I'm looking at the locations locations you go to the market that you're trying to reach and that's african-americans anyone who studies marketing would know
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:38:03.600]  indeed that's what you do if you want to reach the Hispanic community you don't set up in the Italian community you set up in the Hispanic community.
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:15.600]  Now as far as these other services Planned Parenthood well knows that if they can engage our youth at a young age and be their health provider
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:24.600]  when it comes to the mindset of what they're going to do and how they're going to engage in their sexuality we will sell you the condoms
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:37.600]  we'll give you the test we become your guru your teacher your mentor. If Planned Parenthood was really interested in the health of these women
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:45.600]  they would tell them about the obvious things between abortion and breast cancer.
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:58.600]  And we're going to talk about those documented scientific hundreds of major studies that every abortion you have massively increases your chance of getting different types of cancer.
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:09.600]  If your body is meant to abort a baby 99% of the time it will it's very unnatural making the film in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:20.600]  I didn't just believe the quotes by Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood and others even in modern times I went to the universities I sent off for copies of the actual letters
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:32.600]  where they call black people weeds that must be exterminated and you see Bill Gates and his vaccine program clearly tied to a reduced fertility sterilization Nobel laureates on record
[1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:41.600]  even BBC reporting that women are getting HIV who've never had sex in Africa but they've had vaccinations they were caught in Libya doing this
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:52.600]  we have the UN and their internal documents that I covered in in-game saying they want to force inoculate to introduce cancer viruses autoimmune viruses
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:40:02.600]  this is going on against everyone but going back over 100 years ago when eugenics was like a rock and roll craze up until the 40s when Hitler embarrassed them
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:10.600]  they then changed the name of it blacks were the number one target because they could sell more people in the community on going along with it
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:18.600]  on that Russia Today video piece we played half of we'll put it back on screen it's abortion ink is it carrying out black genocide
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:29.600]  abortion ink promoting black genocide inside the United States in the comments I see people in there the minority but still they're there
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:36.600]  saying you black people complain about everything you black people always say you're the victim you black people always say people are out to get you
[1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:42.600]  and yeah well there are too many black people there are too many black thugs out there on and on and on and on
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  and then see once that idea has been accepted then it could be done to everybody I remember debating Planned Parenthood people and debating CPS when they were
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:41:01.600]  season people's kids for no reason they would email me write me call me or in person say who's going to adopt all these black babies are you going to do it
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:08.600]  yeah we're getting rid of them and it's come out in the news that you can call it Planned Parenthood say I want to give money specifically to get rid of
[1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  all these black babies absolutely we agree will help you this is a eugenics organization and Bill Gates his father of course formerly headed it
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:25.600]  and they're all pushing this agenda right now the carbon taxes are about cutting off everybody's resources where you can't even afford to have children
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:37.600]  now and so I wanted to have pastor on our show today from black genocide dot org because he's been fighting this for more than a decade
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:46.600]  and he's been standing up against this corrupt system and fighting for more than a decade and so we're going to get him to break down
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:56.600]  basically what we face as a society but the fact is there's more people wanting to adopt every year in the US it's why people import folks from
[1:41:56.600 --> 1:42:05.600]  South Korea and Europe and other places and Haiti and the truth is people do want to adopt black babies brown babies white babies
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:12.600]  but the system knows this and they don't tell you when you're at Planned Parenthood but there are Christian groups who will 100% of the time
[1:42:12.600 --> 1:42:22.600]  pay you take care of you and help adopt the baby no they just say kill the baby and so this is a window into a much bigger situation
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:33.600]  so I've prefaced that now but I want to go to pastor Leonard Howard Childress Jr. from blackgenocide.org pastor thanks for joining us
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:35.600]  well thank you very much for having me
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:44.600]  a breakdown you're awakening who you are what you've done your research what we're facing here and obviously the larger eugenics operation
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:55.600]  well you know sometimes the longer I stay in it the more I find that it's a humongous machine that I feel the only way it could be uprooted
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:06.600]  the point is for the church the God has always used the church to deal with all social injustices but how I began was just defending the
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:15.600]  unborn here locally in my normal teaching did not even know first thing was the pro-life movement or pro-choice all the terminology
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:25.600]  and a young lady who was more involved than I was regionally asked me did I want to get more involved in the movement she had met one of my
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:34.600]  students walking by an abortion clinic thinking she was going to go in she approached her and she said no my pastor taught me about this already
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:46.600]  and she said well who is your pastor and that led to be going to learn life education resource network there was a conference down at Virginia Beach
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:44:00.600]  and I felt that I should go and my wife and myself went the first time I heard of the Negro project and even why the Akula Ferro was the presenter
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:15.600]  and I heard of the eugenics design the mindsets the ideologies the players and I was stunned and I was stunned to find even more so having gone to college
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:30.600]  and gone to seminary that I never heard any of these things not so much as an iota of these things and yet it was prevalent dominating and at that time the figure was 1442
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:45.600]  african-american children killed each day and here I was a shepherd and didn't know of this devouring agent that was praying upon the african-american community to the degree in which it was
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:45:02.600]  I talked to pastor johnny hunter national director and I said I have to want to partner with you in addressing this issue nationally and locally and thus began my quest and in 2001
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:19.600]  I came up with the idea but 2002 we launched the website blackgenocide.org and actually the young computer Michael Spielman who does a board 73
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:34.600]  another great website if you want to see what abortion is he was helping me put the site together we put all the information together he said what are you going to call it and I said just call it learn
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:52.600]  north east just to reach I want to reach the african-american community with the message of abortion he said well why don't you just call it black genocide that's what you're always calling it any other time and when he said it it was like when Mary heard Elizabeth something leaps in my womb
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:46:07.600]  and I said that's the name black genocide so we called it black genocide.org and well we're going to break down with you the real numbers 52% and that's conservative of blacks never get born they're murdered
[1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:26.600]  that is a bigger statistical genocide than we've even seen in Rwanda against the Tootsies or what we saw with Hitler this is a real genocide and eugenics is the religion of the elite they teach it as phony environmentalism that humans are a disease and a scourge
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:38.600]  this is what funds the entire global government movement it's what you always find it's what all the big banks fund and blacks are their number one target but they're doing it to everyone now
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:44.600]  and so all these fools out there that are racist deep down and say yeah get rid of these black people or get rid of these brown people
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:58.600]  you know all the white supremacists out there it's being done to you as well this is for everyone but blacks are the apple of the globalist eye and I just want to add that you know the good news is we see national statistics
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:12.600]  more and more people are beginning to wake up to this but let's break down the black genocide program the Negro program as it was called by Margaret Sanger and the Rockefeller Foundation and what these mass murderers are doing right now
[1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:28.600]  well no question about it it was a systemic design by the eugenics the elitists of this nation and who are very much more in power than I ever dreamed could dream that they were
[1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:50.600]  and the key thing was to introduce abortion and sterilization to the african-american community it varied down through the years but of course in 1973 by their own evaluation they finally found the key element to reduce the numbers of african-americans under
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  suspicion that they would not be deemed as suspicious and that was through abortion it was also through commandeering key african-american iconic figures to condone it and this is the greatest strategy you know
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:25.600]  Jesse Jackson 1977 is basically where I coined the phrase black genocide was from Jesse Jackson who said abortion is black genocide what happens to a mind of a person in the moral fabric of a nation that can abort a baby without a pang of content
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:42.600]  and that's the one good thing about Jesse Jackson is he did come out against that and you go back to what WED Du Bois and others you read Margaret Sanger's letters she said we can't let these people know we want to kill them they don't trust us we've got to get rid of these weeds we've got to hire black leaders
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:49:03.600]  exactly three or four colored ministers with engaging social background with her exact words and and Jeffy when he decided to be president he wanted to be president realized he wasn't going to get the money he needed and let me switch his position and so he literally became a shepherd leading the sheep to the floor
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:18.600]  and so early on he was good but then he flip-flopped for power how many millions of blacks have been exterminated 16 million and that is the conservative at that time it is a billion dollars worth it to kill 16 million of your own people or anybody
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:30.600]  I mean I mean they could all satan could lead me up on a mountain and say I will make you God on earth if you'll kill one child and I wouldn't do it if they were black or polka dotted or green or white I mean I mean this is so evil
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:51.600]  it is unquestionably evil and it's very sad commentary to the civil rights movement because Dr. King died in 68 and he more or less never there never was really a designated Joshua to come in and lead
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:50:10.600]  and basically they began to fight amongst themselves for power and this brought about an opportunity with Roe versus Wade which was right around a corner to offer money to these leaders and they basically defying their silence and asking for their allegiance
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:33.600]  and now 16 million dead people 16 million and then there's just the consciousness of the deaf culture being so deeply embedded in the African American community the fact that we would embrace a message that would cause a woman to do the antipocal thing about life being in her and that is to kill it
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:44.600]  and that is just the opposite of God of faith of a walk of religious bringing
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:51:01.600]  Rev. Childers stay there blackgenocide.org our websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv we're going to come back and continue breaking this down and of course they don't stop there they put the fluoride in your water the GMO crops all designed to sterilize you

[1:54:00.600 --> 1:54:22.600]  here's the times of London headline from May 24th of last year billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:36.600]  the Rockefeller's Ted Turner Bill Gates Oprah Winfrey secret meeting it says at the end of the article for a world government to forcibly reduce world population
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:50.600]  now it's a litmus test for political candidates in the Democratic Party but the Republicans they could have overturned this most of them go along with it as well to carry out this extermination
[1:54:50.600 --> 1:55:01.600]  and Barack Obama when he got in power took the hold off of billions of dollars in Africa where they come into villages and basically forced abortions on people just like China
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:14.600]  and if you'll adopt this the big global system gives you all the power because it's about killing just like Pharaoh demanded the first born be sacrificed so many other kings throughout history demand your first born or they demand your children
[1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:29.600]  it's an act of submission it's a death cult again I've come through this from studying the globalist own writings and they know what they're doing and this is going on against all communities but the main focus of this
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:48.600]  Luciferian system is killing black people going back to the Reverend Reverend Childress please continue sir breaking down what you were getting into with the black leaders of the 52% of blacks never being born and how we stop this
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:56:02.600]  well and that's what listeners need to know if two african-american women get pregnant one of them for sure is going to choose abortion and at this rate from Alan Gutmacher who sat on the board of Planned Parents
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:21.600]  he probably has better stats than most of the Gutmacher Institute he proudly reports that 52% of all african-american pregnancy ended abortion he also what they failed to tell you of course as you've already alluded to and thank God for your work
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:44.600]  the health ramifications that are just horrific which are never discussed african-americans now by using abortion nearly as a contraceptive of african-american women now lead the country in preterm death rate of their children due to the fact of the multiple abortions
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:57:01.600]  that doesn't allow the utero lining to have the strength enough to carry full term and it's also been documented that these IUDs they put women in the 70s, 80s and 90s were designed to screw up women's uteruses and the same things come up with deprapovera
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:13.600]  that it a lot of times really hurts women's fertility folks you need to understand and I mean I've seen all the big studies they know it increases cancer risk having abortions
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:31.600]  66% and it's just outrageous that the NAACP has fought every year since 2006 from this coming to the floor just for discussion and workshops being set up just from the health issue
[1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:47.600]  point of view since african-american women who account only for 12% of the population are having 37% of the abortion so if that is the case and it's already that abortion is the most performed operation on a woman
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:58:10.600]  how can you not allow the health information especially when it comes to the issue of breast cancer and it can be clearly seen by all data that breast cancer basically rose and skyrocketed right after Roe vs. Wade in the african-american community
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:24.600]  so we're looking for a grassroots just recently it's been a documentary out by AFA and being seen in the Selma Film Festival this Sunday

[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:24.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[2:00:24.600 --> 2:00:46.600]  Pastor Leonard Howard Childress is our guest like genocide.org is the website Pastor you were getting into abortion statistics I've seen hundreds of mainstream news articles from major prestigious research institutions that it causes cervical that it causes
[2:00:46.600 --> 2:01:01.600]  massive increases of cancer in the uterus in the breast because it interrupts a normal cycle and it's very very dangerous for the body and we're sending a crew to interview you about this for an upcoming film but this is a fact and women need to know this and then
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:16.600]  all the evidence of how they push abortion once people get to the Planned Parenthood facility but I want you to continue on any other points you think are most important then I want to get into African Americans black people in this country but all over the world need
[2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:32.600]  to know that their leaders are worse than Judas Iscariot they are there they are financed because if the system comes to you and says hi I'm a Nazi I want to kill you black people are going to run but they come and say I'm a loving liberal I'm going to keep you safe from the Ku Klux Klan
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:49.600]  it's pretty bad but they haven't killed 16 million people I found it's the Birkenstock wearing fake liberal when you really corner them they hate black people they hate life they hate humanity they and their and their green police want to get rid of the majority of the world population
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:02:05.600]  absolutely well especially when it comes to let me get back to one health point of view people say well how does it affect me as a woman when you say breast cancer how does that come about well if you miscarry your brain
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:23.600]  pick that up and send messages throughout the body to shut down if it's surgically done the child or if you have an abortion the brain does not pick that up and it begins to send out impulses to the rest of the body as if you have a child
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:41.600]  and the greatest damage done is in the breath but by the time the brain figures out there's no baby there and that's what the science shows there's a massive hormone flux that's why mammals get cancers thousands of times more often than sharks because sharks don't have hormones
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:59.600]  right and that and isn't it amazing that Planned Parenthood is the leading abortion provider does not share that information with a woman coming in for the first time for an abortion that that is that is negligent that's medical negligence but yet no one holds them accountable which
[2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:17.600]  allows me to segue over to what you know that all that approves right now is and I know this program just for the few minutes I've been on it has been sounding this alarm and it's very important that unfortunately folks the government is very deep into this
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:42.600]  eugenics mindset and movement globally and so they step back a few years ago a few years ago and pick an entity to leave the charge where they could be basically undercover in their intent and agenda to control the numbers of the world but especially of course African-American and they pick Planned Parenthood
[2:03:42.600 --> 2:04:02.600]  and they get three hundred and fifty million one million dollars each day three hundred and fifty million dollars of taxpayer money by both administration whether it's been Democrat or whether it's been Republican and so we find that this is an agenda of
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:27.600]  the leaders that are getting this support from government to continue the eugenics practices of sterilization abortions and seducing third world countries and to taking this in as a part of their day to day so this is going on and it's only one way I believe it could ever come to a close or to stop is that
[2:04:27.600 --> 2:04:50.600]  for the voices of the people to be united as one and to be informed and because it's so massive it would take a massive movement to address this ill and have the data and now this is a day that we do have the data to point out that these eugenics

[2:08:08.600 --> 2:08:23.600]  mind what you've been hearing is not our opinion i've never met the reverend he's never met me his website black genocide is the same as what is the end game dot com or end game it's the facts it's their
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:37.600]  own writings their own program their own operation and I just wanted to add that Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey and others with the Rockefellers the fathers of this they've literally funded the Kaiser villiam institute and Hitler that this is their
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:54.600]  program of control this is what they're into these are the most vicious control freaks you can imagine and when you expand on that and you realize that the CPS is not enough to kill 52% of the black kids and the CPS takes more black
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:09:09.600]  children than any other children statistically they're five to seven times more likely to abuse children they have they then drug them the average foster child more than two thirds in the U.S. are on multiple drugs the average child that's on drugs is on seven
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:25.600]  that's government numbers this is about destroying minds this is a cold blooded operation and this ties into everything everything always goes back to eugenics and I didn't even know what eugenics was 15 years ago I've been doing my research
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:39.600]  studying the global structure who runs it their own writings this is what they are obsessed with you have the U.N. saying the carbon taxes are about destroying industrial society bankrupting people then if you're poor they're going to take your children
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:56.600]  it's just State Department of Random 200 put out by Henry Kissinger telling the third world get rid of half your people or you don't get IMF World Bank money this is what they're doing now going back to pastor children's of black genocide dot org and again our
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:15.600]  websites are info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv on the eugenics subject what is the end game dot com pastor continuing this is key we know that abortion even one abortion massively increases your cancer risk in different parts of the body that are involved in
[2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:27.600]  pregnancy and hormones we know it causes the women to have miscarriages when they try to have children the women are not being told that people would like to adopt those children they're told nobody wants a black child but again this is being
[2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:42.600]  done to everybody but particularly black folks we've got to get this message out to people and point out this is racist genocide because I see black leaders and every other group are given football issues all day it's about racism and how the black
[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:55.600]  leaders are going to protect you and now Hispanic leaders are going to protect them but it's all run by the same groups I mean how do you sit there and watch this and how you fight it every day but what is it like for you inside to know these people are
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:11:14.600]  doing this and have you ever confronted them. Oh absolutely that's my job right now it just evolved but I picketed the NAACP last July I follow them until they bring this onto the floor in discussion they will be picketed no matter where they go in their national
[2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:35.600]  convention I have a friend Yvonne Yule who covers the Detroit events that they do each year we are determined that this comes to the forefront of discussion we made some headway recently in the last few years but it's so ingrained it's very much a part of the
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:53.600]  political system and they're protecting it like you never would believe you have a whole congressional black caucus bought literally and this is staggering that most people would say well you can't buy a whole group of people of that magnitude
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:12:10.600]  well I beg to differ with you they are bought and they all fight to make sure that this is never that they are not held accountable on this information and especially the fact it's affecting African Americans more than any other group in the country
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:33.600]  the fact is that more African American babies have been killed by abortion during the past 30 some odd years that if you were to combine all of the causes AIDS, filing crimes, accidents, cancer, heart disease it wouldn't come to half of the amount that abortion has killed in the
[2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:50.600]  African American community so how in the world can you not bring this to the table it should be discussed in the interest of health forget the political ramifications just in the interest of women's health it should be discussed
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:13:09.600]  and see when you see leaders and black women too black congressmen women so when you see them refuse shield waters when you see them refuse to say anything there's another agenda they have been bought they have interest in vested interest
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:28.600]  and I often say if abortion was not lucrative it would not be legal and they are benefiting off of the blood of African American babies and their silence is bought and so it's up to programs like itself and especially the community leaders
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:45.600]  and especially the church to continue to sound the alarm our African American leadership now it's reached the pinnacle because yes I'm happy that race was no longer a barrier to the Oval Office but
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:58.600]  Dr. King said we were not to judge by the color of skin but by the content of character and now you more or less in the Oval Office have the faith of black genocide
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:17.600]  and this is an ideology of Barack Obama that where he is relentless and that's all that's behind the health reform bill the promise he made to plan parenthood that abortion would be on demand and that government would pay for it and so every taxpayer right now
[2:14:17.600 --> 2:14:36.600]  Travis County just passed the laws the only county in Texas to do it where I have to pay for abortions I have to pay for murdering children so I don't sell out to the new world order eugenicist I don't support abortion but they don't care they're still going to take my money and make me be a party to
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:53.600]  killing people in Austin Texas the city that resides in the county of Travis County and expanding on that you talk about blood on the hands of these people they sell it like it's some wonderful sacrament or a right or a fun thing and people get
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:15:09.600]  wild-eyed when they talk about abortion but the point is it has its roots in exterminating people and it gives them cancer and you got more than half of the black people never existing being murdered in their wound it's
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:25.600]  maiming and wounding these women and can we put two plus two together you got Bill Gates whose daddy ran Planned Parenthood always giving eugenic speeches but he's got special shots for all the African kids it's not enough for him that they're killing half or more than half the blacks here
[2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:36.600]  he's got something special for him and he's got Oprah Winfrey who it turns out is in secret meetings to go over to Africa with her TV network to say roll your sleeves up mama we got something good for you
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:56.600]  absolutely and this is what needs to be seen they're going to be I believe a day of reckoning is coming but the data now is surfacing in places where they never thought it would get to and the college campuses hopefully will be the spawning ground for a
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:16:14.600]  move of social activism that we've never seen before but you have named the players you have also named those more or less who are literally being prostituted African Americans that have said okay we'll play this game for the dollar
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:33.600]  and look at the power she's given look at the power Obama's given I mean here's Obama massively increasing abortion and pushing abortions worldwide and all of this I mean it's so evil he is the 21st century version of the blacks that Margaret Sanger went out and found so she could put a black face on her murder
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:49.600]  absolutely exactly where I believe he was elected and so he got the money you know people today they're still not questioning how he was able to raise the money he was raising but that's another program four times the money that McCain got from Wall Street
[2:16:49.600 --> 2:17:04.600]  absolutely so you see here this is it's massive we're not but we shouldn't be intimidated we should continue to I believe truth crush the earth will rise again and because look at the numbers what 35 years ago when they got 36 years ago when
[2:17:04.600 --> 2:17:18.600]  they got Roe v. Wade through 55 60% depending on the poll were pro abortion they believe it was just a blob of tissue they were lied to but thanks to the 3D imaging and all of it and the truth now I see polls of over 70% nationally and growing or against
[2:17:18.600 --> 2:17:36.600]  abortion absolutely and that's the good news but that's that's the excellent news that the the word is shifting opinion and and we need that shift to happen simply because it is going to intimidate the weaker one and hopefully not going along with
[2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:55.600]  this current agenda of the president and agenda that basically is just like the words of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and I still am shocked over those words we passed what she said in fact quote or but the paraphrase she said and this was last year she said we passed Roe v. Wade to get rid of
[2:17:55.600 --> 2:18:11.600]  undesirable people and the you bottom line that that's right and and people should be in just outrage that you mean you didn't do this based on constitutional law you mean you didn't study the Constitution then come up with your
[2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:27.600]  decision your decision you're telling me was based on an elitist group of people deciding we're going to reduce some numbers it was based on ideology not law that is scary to know in
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:42.600]  where they're commonly saying in an interview is even more shocking and of course I never would think the New York Times would print it but of course they figured they had an end they had a scoop and they did but we should where is
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:55.600]  Nancy Pelosi Jackson where they at they said nothing Nancy Pelosi on one of the Sunday morning shows said we've got a fund abortion because that'll that'll get rid of people and cut the
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:19:04.600]  carbon footprint I mean this is what they talk about this so much behind closed doors are now doing it right out on the open but it's frightening it's
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:18.600]  frightening that there's still no outrage over it and I'm I we're going to continue my hometown newspaper refused to put the quote in the paper and which we're going to take some legal action is that they
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:32.600]  don't want to admit what we have been saying all along this is targeted genocide it is a universal movement of these globalists that you will teach your audience about and it's important for us to
[2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:45.600]  become informed that we can become active in social activism I believe because there is a God that we can turn this thing around absolutely Reverend stay there we're going to skip this break it's a
[2:19:45.600 --> 2:19:57.600]  network break we're skipping it so we have more time with the Reverend this is such an important subject but I would just say to black folks listening right now white people it doesn't matter you need to go to your
[2:19:57.600 --> 2:20:10.600]  NAACP you need to go to city council and you need to every week be there and tell them stop your genocide stop your eugenics stop it because if we could get black folks is angry as they get when a cop shoot some black
[2:20:10.600 --> 2:20:24.600]  youth who is unarmed I mean you got 16 million versus a few hundred blacks getting shot a year how about instead of getting upset when a cop shoves a plunger in somebody and that's bad but it's not 16 million babies chopped up we know those
[2:20:24.600 --> 2:20:37.600]  babies are innocent how about you get as mad about all these babies as you get as some gang person you know dying to shoot out and that's terrible but the point is we know these babies are innocent how about you get angry about that
[2:20:37.600 --> 2:20:50.600]  it's a good point and it's one that I often say and I keep it in perspective I grieve with you on one end but is this not the greater travesty look at the innocent not allowed to be a partaker of the
[2:20:50.600 --> 2:21:09.600]  American dream not allowed their chance for life liberty in the pursuit of happiness I said and you stand and say nothing this is gross negligence this is a great injustice we have done to our own two children who are looking up to us to
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:19.600]  protect we'll be judged by what we do with our most vulnerable right now the judgment would not be good we need to turn that around look at America we accepted a
[2:21:19.600 --> 2:21:34.600]  abortion and then the women get cancer from it we accept torture and all these wars and we're being cursed for it this nation is being cursed by our own actions we allow evil to grow and grow and grow
[2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:49.600]  and grow and for me you know as a white guy my number one issue is eugenics but I can't imagine being a black person out there who goes to all these liberal meetings and NAACP and Republican meetings whatever it is and that their number
[2:21:49.600 --> 2:22:04.600]  one issue isn't your issue because it's the only issue it goes to the heart of who the controllers are a bunch of murdering racist and if they'll set up a system to kill more than half the blacks and a big percentage of all the other groups of humans on this planet
[2:22:04.600 --> 2:22:19.600]  what else are they doing well I've done the research and I know every major GMO food they approve sterilizes the rats and and and gives them cancer and all the studies mainstream news the hundreds of chemicals they put in the water under the name fluoride
[2:22:19.600 --> 2:22:34.600]  in the brain give you cancer reduce fertility the vaccines and their own studies do it the drug insert on the h1n1 said may cause infertility they know what they're doing they engineer all of this into what they do and we have a group of murdering killers
[2:22:34.600 --> 2:22:49.600]  control and and and the football the pageants all the baloney has to end the media tells black people get upset about this issue and they go along with they tell white people get upset about this issue we have to stop letting them tell us what to get upset about
[2:22:49.600 --> 2:23:04.600]  get upset about real issues get upset about the real issues the one issue that are going to impact you the most generationally and unfortunately we still are afraid to confront our own leadership especially the african-american community
[2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:20.600]  we will not confront our leadership on how they have betrayed this community the african-american community for the sake of bill b. lucar they have benefited for power lust from dollars for their own self
[2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:39.600]  and grandisement and they have not thought the service of the people this is the greatest travesty ever in the african-american community the leadership the african-american leadership is pitiful and but i'm praying for a revolt
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:57.600]  well i absolutely agree with you and we are seen as weeds we are seen as trash we're all being experimented on and they beta tested it in the black community because that was a group that was slaves and controlled and it's going on all over the world right now
[2:23:57.600 --> 2:24:12.600]  and it's only getting worse and people some of them don't want to believe this because it's so horrifying but look at history look what other elites have done look at how all the kings of mezzo-america asia middle east europe
[2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:27.600]  they were always culling their slaves when there got to be too many of them and prince philip prince charles father talks about how he wants to call us and all these big professors talk about and now they're saying they want to genetically test you
[2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:36.600]  they've been taking babies blood for 37 years without warrants for a secret dna database at the cold springs harbour eugenics facility that ibm runs and cold springs harbour new york
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:46.600]  and and now they say we're gonna test your blood and we're gonna tell you whether you can have a child or not if statistically we say you have a genetic problem including being aggressive
[2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:56.600]  so see they're also gonna miss label and take full control of our reproductive system we have to defeat abortion now and they'll use that line i'm sorry go ahead
[2:24:56.600 --> 2:25:07.600]  those are the roots of the beginning of the youth genus the cycle is happening again i just i got ready to read that story i didn't have a chance to read it and thank god you're expressing it to me because
[2:25:07.600 --> 2:25:32.600]  if that is the terminology that they use and those are the reasons that is the basic root of eugenics they begin to determine even what we call people mindedness what it we call violent over aggressive slow full lazy i mean these are the things that they feel that they want to control even the behavior of people
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:44.600]  look at black men and tiskegee look at our own atomic soldiers the the government does these tests also test their own people and create cadres of mad scientist that'll follow these orders
[2:25:44.600 --> 2:25:50.600]  well i i it's scary but we can do it we can turn it around we can turn it around
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:59.600]  well how do people get you to come speak in their area or how do people read your website become leaders like yourself and stop the mass murder in their town
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:09.600]  well the good news is that there are people like myself that are being birthed each day it seems like i'm getting emails off my website blackgenocide.org
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:20.600]  and if there's an organization or church or you want to somehow do something to get me out there or someone near and our network to get to you
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:31.600]  i most certainly will discuss that with you we're seeing a wave of a social activism beginning to finally surface and i think it's a god thing
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:47.600]  but though we you can reach me blackgenocide.org also have another website oldbombination.com i did that website in 2007 in an attempt to let the african-american community to know of the agenda Barack Obama
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:27:02.600]  to repeat 2007 but nevertheless i went unheard but the website is there oldbombination.com we're going to upgrade it with some new articles you can get in touch with me on either one of those websites
[2:27:02.600 --> 2:27:12.600]  well we really appreciate the work you're doing because the heart of the new world order is this wish to be god the control technology to use it against the people instead of empowering
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:23.600]  the people and the UN all these groups state they want a world government with a fake environmental tyranny to control every facet of our lives
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:35.600]  and it's not coming it's already here and if everybody wants to see their future look at african-americans look at blacks in africa some countries 45% of the people have HIV
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:43.600]  this is all engineered and if the government's been caught poisoning and killing blacks before and then all the evidence shows they're doing it again now
[2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:50.600]  abortion though it's 16 million dead blacks in america is the tip of the iceberg it is covert
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:57.600]  if somebody will set up a system to make sure more than half of the race dies they'll do other things covertly and we've caught them
[2:27:57.600 --> 2:28:06.600]  and that's what my film in game blueprint for global enslavement covers people can get the dvd at info wars dot com
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:16.600]  and this issue is coming out because it took it took from the 1850s to the 1940s for eugenics to go through one big wave of evil and people stand up against it
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:25.600]  it then went underground it's taken us another 60 plus years to wake up to it again but we're waking up to these devils and we're going to run them back in their holes
[2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:28.600]  with the help of people like the pastor we're talking to today
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:31.600]  god bless you and i appreciate you for having me

[2:32:08.600 --> 2:32:13.600]  as we're finishing off this agenda we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[2:32:13.600 --> 2:32:19.600]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots
[2:32:19.600 --> 2:32:24.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[2:32:24.600 --> 2:32:32.600]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:32:32.600 --> 2:32:35.600]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[2:32:35.600 --> 2:32:41.600]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[2:32:41.600 --> 2:32:48.600]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic
[2:32:48.600 --> 2:33:08.600]  yet your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:33:08.600 --> 2:33:15.600]  well he's shooter Jennings very accomplished musician songwriter in his own right
[2:33:15.600 --> 2:33:20.600]  he plays the crowds 20 30,000 people places Willie Nelson and many others
[2:33:20.600 --> 2:33:26.600]  he's got a whole bunch of hit albums but his new one black ribbons blew me away
[2:33:26.600 --> 2:33:37.600]  I mean eclectic isn't even the right word it's like Pink Floyd meets Muse meets you know renegade rebel type country like his father
[2:33:37.600 --> 2:33:49.600]  really amazing and it's got Stephen King with intros and shooter originally wrote it and then King adapted it so amazing and the shooter
[2:33:49.600 --> 2:33:57.600]  I'm very proud I'm honored also said a little bit of my ideas and things went into it it's a radio talk show host who's introducing these
[2:33:57.600 --> 2:34:03.600]  and I just made a list of some of the tracks we're going to play we're going to play some of them in entirety others just in pieces
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:12.600]  there's a little bit of French in there from of course Stephen King and being on AM and FM stations we did clip some of that out some of the non-kings English
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:21.600]  and of course the website is shooter like bang bang shooter Jennings dot com we have it linked up on info wars dot com and prisonplanet.com
[2:34:21.600 --> 2:34:26.600]  and a shooter it's great to have you back with us man it's great to be on the air with you buddy
[2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:35.600]  I notice with this album you're using a lot of new world order Illuminati symbolism out in the open is that to identify what we're dealing with
[2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:43.600]  yeah a little bit you know and I feel like that when I kind of became inspired by that I was driving across country and the economy collapsed
[2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:49.600]  and I was kind of witnessing all the fear mongering and all the kind of a looming police state issues and things like that
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:57.600]  and I really went and started digging and and kind of took everything that I learned from people like you and and and all the people that are kind of
[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:07.600]  making people aware of the kind of globalist agenda and the new world order and kind of put it all into a piece of art for people to take and absorb you know
[2:35:07.600 --> 2:35:10.600]  well it's powerful who did that art
[2:35:10.600 --> 2:35:20.600]  the drawing on the front was drawn by a guy named Mike Sportus who's a great artist who's a good friend of ours and a lot of the artwork on the inside
[2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:30.600]  was a collaborative effort between a fantastic artist named Sonny Kay and myself all of who are really into like info wars dot com
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:36.600]  and reality sandwich and a lot of these websites and kind of information sources
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:41.600]  you know we're all kind of grew up in this world and are trying to
[2:35:41.600 --> 2:35:49.600]  understand it ourselves and you know thanks to a lot of these sources we're able to kind of know about what's going on behind the chat
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:52.600]  the thing is what the media want you know you know
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:54.600]  break out of the matrix well
[2:35:54.600 --> 2:36:02.600]  later we'll get more into Stephen King and how you got to know him and how you guys work together on this spoken word that we're going to hear that
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:10.600]  intros quite a few of the songs but going back to your previous music it's extremely diverse as well
[2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:18.600]  I mean when did you first start waking up to the shadow government the new world order the social controllers that are manipulating our reality
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:28.600]  well I think you know I'd always been kind of into exploring these kind of facets of the world but it wasn't until about 08 when the
[2:36:28.600 --> 2:36:37.600]  economy collapsed that with the two-year-old daughter that I have knowing that she's going to inherit this place and kind of seeing everything that was going on
[2:36:37.600 --> 2:36:48.600]  I was driving across country like I said to go start doing this album and really that it was right when the economy collapsed all I had with me in talk radio
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:55.600]  and I would pick up anything from coast to coast AM one of the episodes which had David Icon and I was picking up you when I was driving through Texas
[2:36:55.600 --> 2:37:03.600]  I was picking up all kinds of different sources of this and it was really the discussions that were going on just completely frightened me
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:14.600]  man and I really then during the once I reached LA and we started working on this record I really dove head first into all the kind of information that you
[2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:22.600]  and all these sources were kind of trying to get people to wake up to you know and it really infatuated me and I really wanted to create
[2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:30.600]  you know I want people to take from the album what they take from it yeah you know it is a piece of art but at the same time and kind of a fictional future
[2:37:30.600 --> 2:37:39.600]  but at the same time it's like all of these these kind of prophecies all these things you guys have been talking about are all coming true and so it's like you know
[2:37:39.600 --> 2:37:53.600]  where where people I just want people to just like you do to to inform themselves and do the digging and you'll see that there's just a lot of a lot of bad things going on you know
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:38:02.600]  people need to absolutely not even believe what you or I are saying but realize there's a bigger world going on there's a lot of things happening we're at a key juncture
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:11.600]  in human development and everyone can feel it not just intellectually see it but feel it either people are joining more with the dark side more with the evil
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:23.600]  or they're feeling called on a literal quest like child roll into the dark tower came to be part of history on the right side of history for this species and our future progeny
[2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:37.600]  you're right and I start tower up to that fantastic story absolutely now I'm going to play a lot of this they were very gracious that I could air it all but we won't have time but I do plan on playing more of it later in the week
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:49.600]  shooter why did you choose to premiere this because it doesn't come out till tomorrow here on my show I'm extremely honored well I'll tell you what man I just feel like that that you and your audience are the kind of people that already
[2:38:49.600 --> 2:39:02.600]  would already feel at home with what I'm talking about and already know are already informed you know and I just feel like that that this kind of a platform is the perfect place for this record to be understood you know
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:15.600]  so I don't think that there's any other radio program or any other program that I can go on and play this record and the people would know exactly what I was talking about and maybe you know pull something out of it that they didn't know you know so
[2:39:15.600 --> 2:39:28.600]  it to me it's just the perfect the perfect match well we're glad you reached out because I'm obviously a fan of you and your iconic father and now to see you on this mission is very very exciting
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:44.600]  we're going to go to track three which is an intro with Stephen King and what is it how do you pronounce it Triska Decapobia Triska Decapobia or fear of 13 and then there's a story of progression with the spoken word and the songs
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:56.600]  and the request within the album and we'll talk about the deeper meeting with you coming up but here it is folks Stephen King introducing Triska Decapobia here it is shooter Jennings
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:19.600]  from the center of nowhere atop the shoulders of giants above the creeping fog of disinformation that clouds the American Union this is one of the whips and this is the last light radio your last beacon of truth and defiance I'm always starting my shows by saying that all ships lost in the night search for the lighthouse on the rock of the enlightenment
[2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:30.600]  but good truth seekers out there the battery is fading and the light is dying I see the freedom has failed us and with no light the night's going to be a long one
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:40.600]  Woody Guthrie said this land is your land this land is my land great words but this land is their land now
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:52.600]  this will be the last time your ears and my voice will be getting together because as a midnight tonight the previously public airways will be commandeered for government approved and regulated transmission
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:41:02.600]  the last breath of free speech will blow itself out what rises in its place is going to be the wind of thought control bad guys win folks
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:18.600]  you know I don't always play a lot of music on the show as most of it these days is process bubblegum bolt churned out by the overlords of double speaking meant to turn a gray world grayer but tonight I won't go without leaving a message
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:34.600]  tonight I've chosen to play the one band the American fascicats don't want me to play tonight I'm going off to hear with the music of Herephant for those of you not familiar you'll get a taste of Herephant's music tonight their message their life
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:52.600]  I started you off with Wake Up from their 2009 album Bohemian Grove their first and most radical remember what the song says don't let him get you down the most important truth is love all you know and all you need to know is the poet says
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:42:10.600]  what was that beauty what's the difference love your family love your neighbor love your enemy as yourself go on loving it's what humans do best and the one thing they can't kill got it this is one of the ways the time now is no time the temperature is cold the news is blue
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:24.600]  but for now the light still shines off the same album here's Triska Decaphobia that's fear of 13 my sons and daughters as in 13 o'clock you're listening to the last night of the last night
[2:42:40.600 --> 2:43:00.600]  one room I'm really in tonight screams from around coming down the hall take me back to a place that I can't calm in my mind
[2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:16.600]  the jackal of hearts will break me and save me like Jesus baby don't see it look through your mind the jackal of hearts is aching
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:32.600]  the time now cold the news is blue but for now the light still shines off the same album here's Triska Decaphobia that's fear of 13 o'clock you're listening to the last night of the last night
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:48.600]  one room I'm really in tonight screams from around coming down the hall take me back to a place that I can't calm in my mind
[2:43:48.600 --> 2:44:04.600]  the jackal of hearts will break me and save me like Jesus baby don't see it look through your mind the jackal of hearts is aching
[2:44:04.600 --> 2:44:20.600]  the time now cold the news is blue but don't see it look through your mind
[2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:46.600]  that's part of Triska Decaphobia from the band Hierophant Shooter Jinnings and of course you heard that intro by Stephen King the legendary bestselling author
[2:44:46.600 --> 2:44:54.600]  tell us about that song because the lyrics go on for a while and you're talking about assassinations aren't you
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:45:04.600]  yeah you know I was in my studies and all of this I kind of dug into I found some interesting pockets of people talking about Diana's death
[2:45:04.600 --> 2:45:18.600]  and that they thought it was a murder and that there was all these even further deeper conspiracies that people had kind of come to about the death of her grandmother
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:28.600]  and the kind of that it is almost a sacrificial thing now and whether or not that's true I think that I took away from it this kind of looming feeling
[2:45:28.600 --> 2:45:41.600]  of like growing more and more aware that all everything that people are told through the media is really a complete charade that's set up with a purpose in mind
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:51.600]  whether or not Diana's death was intentional or unintentional the thing that I pulled away from it was it made me feel guilty to know that I didn't know
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:46:00.600]  and I think with the lyrics the first chorus deals with the jack of hearts which was JFK and the second one was the queen of hearts third was the king of hearts which was Martin Luther King
[2:46:00.600 --> 2:46:14.600]  we just don't know with these figures and you know whenever someone comes and speaks out with a message of peace and a message of against what the government agenda is
[2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:21.600]  it seems you know they get snuffed out you look at John Lennon you look at all these different people and you know we could get into the mind control
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:34.600]  pat the aspect of you know what the name Lee Harvey or any of these folks that committed these crimes I mean half of them didn't remember it
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:40.600]  half of them just you know the guy killed the same thing with Sir Hand Sir Hand it's the same thing with McVeigh
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:49.600]  and then they publicly had Jolly and Wes the head MK Ultra doctor for the years it took him for the trial and then when he was on death row and his execution
[2:46:49.600 --> 2:46:59.600]  Jolly and Wes was with McVeigh until the very end a top mind control doctor yeah it's insane man and it's like it's such a proven that they've done that
[2:46:59.600 --> 2:47:09.600]  it's like proven history it's not classified absolutely yeah I mean it's just scary you know and and you just watch how like I saw you on that show
[2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:20.600]  the Jesse Ventura show which because I wasn't sure when I saw that show on TV I was like this disinformation because I couldn't believe that a major network would run a show about this kind of stuff
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:30.600]  that they tackle some very interesting things on there I mean I was watching the mind control episode and just that they were you know the kind of things they were talking about in experiments they were testing
[2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:41.600]  pretty I'll tell you this Ventura is for real he set out to find he thought global warming was real till he found that it was all a fraud and that show aired right as all the fraud came out
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:53.600]  the system can't ignore all of this they got a little bit of it out now as a steam valve and that's even what Ventura thinks they're doing but no that sure was that show was done from a pure position
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:48:03.600]  I mean I could I mean I could Vince Ventura of a lot of it well I when I saw I knew when I saw you and I called there that I would like that there's no way that you guys would associate with something if it wasn't there
[2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:15.600]  the real deal I just you know it was it was shocking to me the first day I ever saw it because I couldn't believe they would let that on on you know at that time Warner on the company would let
[2:48:15.600 --> 2:48:25.600]  well they've been trying to cover it up for decades and so it made it even more taboo and more avant-garde and more hot so now they're allowing a little bit of it out there but just a little bit
[2:48:25.600 --> 2:48:34.600]  now we're about to go to another song we come back from break you'll tell us about the song don't feed the animals then we'll rejoin with King more will of the

Pearson from the mid 70s called the hero within six archetypes we live by even though it's nearly 40 years old the book still speaks of the journey each of us takes through our lives the innocent the orphan the wanderer the warrior the martyr the magician
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:45.600]  we float between these identities they change as the phases of our lives take center stage one after the other today I feel like a martyr but tomorrow I'll be a warrior for even though my time as the magician is drawing to an end the innocent in me will continue to believe in hope
[2:54:45.600 --> 2:54:59.600]  in love and that the goodness of humanity will prevail here's your offense take on the journey from innocence to experience which is another way of saying from innocence to orphanhood
[2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:16.600]  all right and that's part there's more of a Stephen King and some of the intros the music we're gonna go out here in a moment we got the best for last coming up in the next hour with Stephen King and of course the music of shooter Jennings and Herefen the website shooter Jennings dot com the album premieres tomorrow
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:39.600]  let me ask you this what would your father think of what's happening in the world today what would Waylon Jennings think about what you're doing well I mean it's hard to say because he he passed away he was right after 911 I mean you know he wasn't he wasn't someone who's very outspoken politically that believe that he didn't like to to be like a lot of these other artists that'll go out there and just
[2:55:39.600 --> 2:55:59.600]  never ever about it all the time but I think you know at the end of the day my dad's heart was in the love of the people around you and and that I think to believe that you know that America at times have been have been on the right track but I definitely feel like he would feel that what was going on right now was with a very scary period
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:17.600]  and you know I think in some way or another he's heard this record and I think that he would agree with me I mean you know I believe that the kind of overall message of this record is about the people that are close to you and how important your family is and your friends and the love in that that your micro community in your life because
[2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:31.600]  everything outside of that is a disaster and it's like if you can just nurture the things on a small level I think you know that's what's important and I think he would have definitely said by that method you know he would have been proud of it though
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:57.600]  absolutely well I know I'm certainly just proud that you're premiering this here today shooter Jennings dot com the album is black ribbons it's very eclectic a lot of different styles I mean I'm really blown away and impressed you're only hearing a small snippet of this we're going to play a few songs in their entirety coming up but let's go out with lights in the sky from the album black ribbons comes out tomorrow
[2:56:57.600 --> 2:57:04.600]  again the album black ribbons

[2:59:58.600 --> 3:00:26.600]  the night seems so calm doesn't it as if time is frozen the city below used to sound like a mechanical ocean moving in giant waves now silent no cars no kids nothing but transport trucks and men with guns standing on street corners what a waste but isn't this what they wanted what they bargained for
[3:00:26.600 --> 3:00:41.600]  they create a problem so they can offer a solution they scare us then offer relief and we fall on our knees and gratitude they create a war promised peace and we walk into their traps like mice
[3:00:41.600 --> 3:01:02.600]  from where I sit I can look down at a big park where I used to watch birds gather while old men played chess and tired women pushed sleeping children and strollers where teenagers used to hold hands and sometimes stop to kiss now it's a tense city filled with soldiers there are guns instead of roses
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:13.600]  I can see one armed man clearly and I've got to wonder if he thinks he's serving justice I've got to wonder if he truly knows who he is which brings us to our next song
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:32.600]  to you son with your guns and grenades standing there in all your graceless glory I dedicate this next song here's Herefan with everything else's illusion from the well wishers album I'm Willa DeWiss you're you and we're riding the night together
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:02:00.600]  music

[3:02:59.600 --> 3:03:10.600]  music
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:32.600]  music
[3:03:32.600 --> 3:03:50.600]  well that was Stephen King introducing everything else is illusion and the song goes on and on with amazing lyrics we come back in the next segment we're going to break down the meaning of the last few songs and how a shooter worked with Stephen King Stephen King who's recently been in Texas
[3:03:50.600 --> 3:04:15.600]  but we'll just leave it at that and we are going to work on getting him on the show shooter feels good about that obviously that's pretty exciting but we do have him here today Stephen King we're premiering this information here on air Stephen King working with shooter Jennings we'll talk about how they got hooked up together we're going to go out with just a little bit of another clip from everything is illusion we'll be right back
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:21.600]  music
[3:04:21.600 --> 3:04:41.600]  music
[3:04:41.600 --> 3:04:49.600]  music

[3:05:09.600 --> 3:05:14.040]  bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:18.040]  electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of
[3:05:18.040 --> 3:05:22.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:26.720]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[3:05:26.720 --> 3:05:30.440]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[3:05:30.440 --> 3:05:34.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[3:05:34.600 --> 3:05:37.840]  families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a

[3:07:50.400 --> 3:07:55.720]  monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the
[3:07:55.720 --> 3:08:04.280]  system. Call 800-686-2237. As I've been cleaning up around here, I've been thinking
[3:08:04.280 --> 3:08:09.240]  about the 10 plus years I've spent talking to you every night. I've got the
[3:08:09.240 --> 3:08:14.520]  original microphone from when I used to broadcast from a pirate station. Not a way
[3:08:14.520 --> 3:08:19.040]  up there with air is rare, but from a filthy basement with puddles of ooze on
[3:08:19.040 --> 3:08:25.120]  the floor. I used to wrap into that mic, that's what we called it. Wrapping with
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:29.440]  my damn Uncle Sam button pinned to one side of my chest and the one that said
[3:08:29.440 --> 3:08:35.000]  killing for peace is like roughing for chastity on the other. Still got those
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:41.720]  buttons too. It's been a great ride. We could make it through this hard time
[3:08:41.720 --> 3:08:46.720]  folks. Feel our way through this darkness, but it's gonna take time and it's
[3:08:46.720 --> 3:08:52.120]  gonna cost lives. Yet the answer is self-evident, like those truths we used
[3:08:52.120 --> 3:08:57.960]  to hold dear, and the love of mankind may still come out on top. Our children's
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:09:04.000]  children might still live in a better, more beautiful world. Do I believe that?
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:11.140]  Yeah. With a glass of Jack in one hand, I manage. This next song is pure
[3:09:11.140 --> 3:09:16.120]  nostalgia at this point, harking back to a time when the world economy was going
[3:09:16.120 --> 3:09:20.600]  down and we really believed things couldn't get any worse. But what did we
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:24.960]  know? The cost turned out to be higher than all the government bailouts and
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:30.440]  stimulus packages combined. Here's some real stimulus, Summer of Rage by
[3:09:30.440 --> 3:09:53.680]  Hierophant. I'm Will of Wisp.
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:10:05.000]  Chaos is hanging around. A tree to the ground, shut it from the sound. That
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:15.640]  machine ain't slowing down. It's gaiting power for power. A gas mask is the
[3:10:15.640 --> 3:10:22.080]  creature in the Summer of Rage. They're building mass graves within the states.
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:32.080]  You and I need to vaccinate. They're preparing us for tomorrow. But we need to stay.
[3:10:52.080 --> 3:11:18.880]  That's Summer of Rage, introduced by Stephen King, Shooter Jennings, our guest,
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:22.760]  very successful musician in his own right. They just shot a music video to be
[3:11:22.760 --> 3:11:26.320]  out later in the week. The album was released tomorrow. Okay, we've been playing
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:30.200]  a lot of music. We haven't had time to comment on the tracks. I mean, talking
[3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:34.320]  about the death machine in Summer of Rage. Let's talk about Summer of Rage and
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:38.040]  the message in that song. It's just a small piece of it, folks. I don't want to
[3:11:38.040 --> 3:11:42.160]  go back through everything as illusion, lights in the sky, and also talk about
[3:11:42.160 --> 3:11:50.240]  your creative process with Stephen King. But let's talk about, again, Summer of
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:54.800]  Rage, what you're talking about there. Man, yeah, that song is kind of the most
[3:11:54.800 --> 3:11:58.920]  direct, I feel like, of all the songs in the record kind of dealing with the
[3:11:58.920 --> 3:12:02.240]  state of the world right now. I mean, you know, we talk about the FEMA camps and
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:07.880]  the vaccinations in that song, as well as just the fact that, you know, with all
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:13.680]  the changes in the world, the agenda is still full-on on par, it seems, with these
[3:12:13.680 --> 3:12:18.840]  people. So, to me, that song is kind of the song to my daughter and the kind of
[3:12:18.840 --> 3:12:24.640]  fear of the world that she's going to inherit, you know, because we're
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:30.760]  definitely not turning things around. I mean, it's definitely a scary thing
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:34.480]  coming, you know, and like I said, we shot a video for this that Dre and I
[3:12:34.480 --> 3:12:39.160]  directed, that we should have up pretty soon for Summer of Rage. We're still
[3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:45.320]  kind of editing it now, but it's like the culture of the world, you know, it's
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:51.120]  scary. People, since the kids in front of the TV are maybe sat by these little
[3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:56.000]  mind control boxes, and then the, you know, the government's preparing for
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:13:02.480]  World War, mass genocide, and there, you know, with these H1N1 vaccinations
[3:13:02.480 --> 3:13:09.400]  in every mall and every airport, and it's like all this stuff is just, you know,
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:14.520]  building into this massive shadow that kind of looms over everything, and so
[3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:19.120]  Summer of Rage, and the title was taken from a lot of the, you know, there was a
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:23.640]  lot of riots going on last summer when the economy fell, and different
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:28.080]  people were dying, and all these different countries over this economic
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:31.360]  collapse, they were saying, you know, should America prepare for a Summer of
[3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:37.080]  Rage like these other people had, and it really frightened me, and during the
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:40.440]  process, I tried to bring a lot of writing this record, I tried to bring a
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:45.040]  lot of those emotions to the top, and Summer of Rage is a perfect example of
[3:13:45.040 --> 3:13:49.640]  that. Well, Shooter, that's why I think it's so important that most people get
[3:13:49.640 --> 3:13:53.560]  married to have children, because it's biological, and it's also spiritual at
[3:13:53.560 --> 3:13:58.720]  the same time. You become a less worldly person, you become more focused, you
[3:13:58.720 --> 3:14:02.560]  understand that even if you've been worldly previously, which all of us have
[3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:07.840]  been, to a certain extent, and selfish, that you really are tied into a larger
[3:14:07.840 --> 3:14:12.400]  human experience when you have children, it starts something biological in you
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:17.440]  where you do want to make a better world, because you realize...
[3:14:17.440 --> 3:14:19.480]  No, no, go ahead.
[3:14:19.480 --> 3:14:23.840]  Very true. You know, I know people, it's funny, just the people that I know who have
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:26.840]  had children that was having this conversation the other day, it's just,
[3:14:26.840 --> 3:14:32.720]  there's something that happens in you, and it changes everything, and to me,
[3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:37.000]  those are the people on this planet that are going to be...the only people on this
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:42.320]  planet, I feel, that are really going to have their head straight for a positive
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:45.520]  future are the people that have experienced that having children. I mean,
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:49.440]  I'm not to say that there aren't people who don't have children that won't have
[3:14:49.440 --> 3:14:52.880]  this kind of positive influence on the world, but I really think it is a giant
[3:14:52.880 --> 3:14:55.840]  impact. I mean, for me, I was the same way you could have said it better, being
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:14:59.920]  worldly and being selfish, you know, and you make...there's almost a certain
[3:14:59.920 --> 3:15:04.440]  responsibility to yourself that you don't have it, so you have a child, and it's...
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:10.160]  With me, with my music, with her, a lot of the inspiration too for this record was
[3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:14.520]  me feeling like I had to be putting a message forward that she's
[3:15:14.520 --> 3:15:20.640]  going to be able to look back on and, you know, study or just learn from, and I,
[3:15:20.640 --> 3:15:23.920]  you know, I had to be responsible, it felt fun doing songs about getting drunk and
[3:15:23.920 --> 3:15:27.600]  partying, but, you know, at the end of the day, that's not what the human
[3:15:27.600 --> 3:15:31.240]  experience is about. That's just things that deter the human experience, and it
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:38.480]  really, for me, it was...this whole record was kind of that emotion of
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:43.520]  trying to better the world through her. Let's talk a little bit about Stephen
[3:15:43.520 --> 3:15:46.560]  King and coming up later in the hour. We have a really long segment, we'll have
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:51.120]  plenty of time, but talking to you, I guess Stephen King is a fan of
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:54.360]  Shooter Jennings, and he wrote about you or used a character named Shooter Jennings
[3:15:54.360 --> 3:15:58.160]  in your book, then you reached out to him, or how did you end up having Stephen
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:03.320]  King do spoken word intros to your album? Well, he had written some really nice
[3:16:03.320 --> 3:16:09.280]  things about my music and his columns in Entertainment Weekly, and I was
[3:16:09.280 --> 3:16:12.280]  always completely flattered, and then he wrote this book called Life's Story, which
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:15.920]  took place in Nashville, and my name is in it, but it just, in passing, like it was
[3:16:15.920 --> 3:16:21.000]  like a moment when this girl was in a car and she was upset, and it wasn't the
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:25.280]  time for Shooter Jennings on the radio, basically, to what it said, and so I knew
[3:16:25.280 --> 3:16:30.160]  that I was on his radar, and when I was kind of creating this record, I'd
[3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:37.200]  always wanted the record to really be about this talk radio guy, and I just
[3:16:37.200 --> 3:16:43.200]  had my mindset on trying to reach out to him, and I did finally be an email, and
[3:16:43.200 --> 3:16:46.440]  like we were saying, I've still never spoken to him or met him. It was all an
[3:16:46.440 --> 3:16:52.640]  email interaction, but I wrote him and said, you know, I've got this album, and
[3:16:52.640 --> 3:16:55.680]  I know you're probably busy. Well, he wrote me back, you know, and he was like,
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:17:00.400]  so nice, I mean, so gracious, so nice, but he said he was busy, he had a lot of
[3:17:00.400 --> 3:17:03.240]  things going on, he was afraid he might not be able to come through, but if I
[3:17:03.240 --> 3:17:07.600]  wasn't too discouraged to send him the record and the ideas, and I did, and we
[3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:13.160]  just kept emailing back and forth over the period of a couple months, and he was
[3:17:13.160 --> 3:17:18.480]  just so generous and cool and gracious, and like, you know, just everything that
[3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:24.080]  you would, I mean, he just was just an unbelievable human being, and so here I
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:28.280]  was with Stephen King on the hook, and I'm like, oh man, now I feel like an idiot
[3:17:28.280 --> 3:17:32.000]  because I've gotten him, you know, gotten his ear, and I was like, I better deliver
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:37.880]  with this, so we, I finally sent him some tracks, and then after a while, like, I
[3:17:37.880 --> 3:17:41.640]  could tell he was really into it, but he didn't, I don't think I was doing a good
[3:17:41.640 --> 3:17:46.400]  job of kind of showing him exactly what I meant by the, by the role, and so I wrote
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:53.960]  this kind of draft script, which I sent to him, and man, like, you know, a month
[3:17:53.960 --> 3:17:57.560]  later on my doorstep, I had to package, I had a CD with a picture of him in the
[3:17:57.560 --> 3:18:04.400]  studio doing the tracks on the CD and in the transcript that he had adjusted and
[3:18:04.400 --> 3:18:08.440]  added a bunch of great stuff, and he came up with the ending for the whole thing,
[3:18:08.440 --> 3:18:12.920]  and it was really just a real magical thing, and I owe him a lot because it was
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:19.000]  such a gracious, you know, use of his time for, for silly old bae kind of thing, you know?
[3:18:19.000 --> 3:18:24.040]  Absolutely. We're gonna go out here, we're gonna come back and talk more about your
[3:18:24.040 --> 3:18:29.600]  interactions with Stephen King and, and where his mindset is, and how you guys
[3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:36.680]  came up with this particular talk radio character, but next we're gonna go out
[3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:39.920]  with the illuminated, just a small clip of that, and then come back with more
[3:18:39.920 --> 3:18:45.440]  Stephen King when the radio goes dead. So stay with us, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:18:45.440 --> 3:19:10.720]  Shooter Jennings premiering much of his new album here today, Black Ribbons.

[3:20:58.480 --> 3:21:04.240]  Freeze-dry guy, the best you can buy. Today, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources,
[3:21:04.240 --> 3:21:09.840]  March 1st, 2010. Goal opened this morning at 11.1630. A one ounce gold coin can be
[3:21:09.840 --> 3:21:15.520]  purchased for 11.4679, 5.7339 for a half ounce, or 2.8670 for the
[3:21:15.520 --> 3:21:22.720]  quarter ounce. That's 11.4679, 5.7339, and 2.8670. How is it that we the people
[3:21:22.720 --> 3:21:26.720]  grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and
[3:21:26.720 --> 3:21:30.360]  fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately
[3:21:30.360 --> 3:21:34.120]  owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to
[3:21:34.120 --> 3:21:37.960]  service the debt? Is this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when he said,
[3:21:37.960 --> 3:21:41.440]  a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the
[3:21:41.440 --> 3:21:45.520]  liberties of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a
[3:21:45.520 --> 3:21:49.000]  silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.

[3:22:18.440 --> 3:22:23.560]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[3:22:23.560 --> 3:22:28.560]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the
[3:22:28.560 --> 3:22:33.400]  enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel, hell-bent on destroying
[3:22:33.400 --> 3:22:37.360]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[3:22:37.360 --> 3:22:41.200]  Bernanke and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[3:22:41.200 --> 3:22:45.280]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and
[3:22:45.280 --> 3:22:51.400]  right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of

[3:24:01.960 --> 3:24:07.480]  Times winding down friends, the witching hour is almost upon us. I can't tell you
[3:24:07.480 --> 3:24:11.920]  how much I'll miss our night rides together. When I push back from this mic
[3:24:11.920 --> 3:24:15.960]  and get out of the old chair with the broken seat, that's when the sadness
[3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:22.800]  starts. The moon is full tonight and the silence is rich. In our time together
[3:24:22.800 --> 3:24:27.680]  we've seen crooked politicians hauled squealing into the courts. We've
[3:24:27.680 --> 3:24:33.000]  exposed toadstool hypocrites to the light of day. We've even won a victory or two
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:39.360]  for human rights. We said yes we can and for a while yes we could. Sometimes we
[3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:44.240]  fought along the law didn't win but this time they've divided us so they can
[3:24:44.240 --> 3:24:49.640]  conquer us. Remember one thing though, they can muzzle me but they can't muzzle
[3:24:49.640 --> 3:24:55.560]  the love and truth in your heart. Lies will still be exposed and injustice can
[3:24:55.560 --> 3:25:02.440]  still be overturned. It's not too late. The truth can still set you free. Guard the
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:08.600]  love in your heart. Guard the truth. Here's another truth. Here's when the radio
[3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:36.040]  goes dead.
[3:25:36.040 --> 3:25:40.760]  And this song then really builds up. Just all of it's so beautiful. That's when
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:47.080]  the radio goes dead. It's a six minute track. We're gonna come back and play
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:52.840]  some full songs in the next long segment. We're gonna go out here in just a
[3:25:52.840 --> 3:25:57.160]  moment with all of this could have been yours. And we're just playing small
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:25:59.960]  clips of this throughout the week. I'm gonna play some of these songs in their
[3:25:59.960 --> 3:26:03.280]  entirety here with the radio. A listenership because shooter's been
[3:26:03.280 --> 3:26:07.080]  gracious enough to let us do that. But shooter, when we come back in the next
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:10.040]  segment, we'll have more time but a little bit now. I mean this is really
[3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:15.280]  almost an apocalyptic album and you're going through this story of this talk
[3:26:15.280 --> 3:26:21.040]  show host saying it's his last broadcast. I mean is this often the future after the
[3:26:21.040 --> 3:26:26.040]  New World Order has come into power? I think that the place that I imagined when
[3:26:26.040 --> 3:26:30.960]  I created this kind of idea for this world was a place where that it was just
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:36.240]  the very beginning of that. There was a spot in there that we
[3:26:36.240 --> 3:26:39.720]  had that I took out and I'll explain to you why. There was something that he said
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:43.880]  where he said that there was basically a martial law and there were curfews in
[3:26:43.880 --> 3:26:47.800]  place. And the reason I took that out is because I thought if this was in the
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:26:52.520]  future and this was the scenario, everyone in the world would know there
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:55.760]  were curfews. So he wouldn't have to say it. It would be like exposition. But the
[3:26:55.760 --> 3:27:00.360]  thing is I kind of imagined this place where it was like a modern
[3:27:00.360 --> 3:27:06.800]  American city that had now become a kind of populated by soldiers and there
[3:27:06.800 --> 3:27:11.640]  were like curfews in place because of possible you know that you know for our
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:16.720]  own good kind of scenario that they're doing. But like I kind of imagined it
[3:27:16.720 --> 3:27:21.320]  being a little bit pre-apocalyptic, pre the New World Order being in full swing,
[3:27:21.320 --> 3:27:27.240]  but it was like right about to take over you know. It's really scary to me the
[3:27:27.240 --> 3:27:33.600]  whole the whole scenario of it being like that, it being possible that we
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:38.560]  could end up with a global kind of you know the United Nations could swing in
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:44.880]  at any time and decide that they're gonna you know put the lock the United States
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:49.680]  down because of dangers of wars and we've got China and Russia and North
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:54.800]  Korea and Iraq and all these places that are gunning for us and you know
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:27:59.520]  what I feel like we're just baiting them you know like the people that are
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:02.600]  in power are just baiting them because they would love that to happen so they
[3:28:02.600 --> 3:28:07.960]  can then say oh we need to lock this whole place down and take control so we
[3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:12.920]  can make everything better you know. Absolutely we're gonna go out with all
[3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:18.440]  of this could have been yours and we're gonna come back and wait till how this
[3:28:18.440 --> 3:28:22.480]  ends with Stephen King what happens to the radio host at the end that's coming
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:26.480]  up in the final segment we'll be right back.
[3:28:52.480 --> 3:29:21.480]  I felt the storm and swam until the skies were clear and I found a home and my home is crooked and all of this would have been, all of this could have been yours.
[3:29:23.480 --> 3:29:31.480]  All of this should have been, all of this could have been yours.
[3:29:31.480 --> 3:30:00.480]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[3:33:11.480 --> 3:33:22.480]  I'm giving him the finger. I'll shut down when I'm damn good and rich.
[3:33:29.480 --> 3:33:35.480]  All of this could have been yours. Now you got cut off on the last break shooter.
[3:33:35.480 --> 3:33:42.480]  You were getting into what this album means, the overall message. I want to go back over some of the story behind the other earlier tracks.
[3:33:42.480 --> 3:33:47.480]  And we're going to play Wake Up, which is your and my favorite song.
[3:33:47.480 --> 3:33:53.480]  Separately, I didn't know that was your favorite until I saw one of your emails. In fact, your favorite four or my favorite four.
[3:33:53.480 --> 3:33:58.480]  I mean, it's such amazing music and it goes on sale tomorrow.
[3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:03.480]  So before we go any further, tell folks how they get a copy of Hero Fan's Black Ribbons.
[3:34:03.480 --> 3:34:07.480]  Man, you can get it anywhere except for Target. Target is the only place that's not carrying it.
[3:34:07.480 --> 3:34:15.480]  I think it wasn't for any political reasons. I think it was just their downsizing their stuff and they weren't sure how it was going to do because it was such a risk.
[3:34:15.480 --> 3:34:24.480]  But you can get it anywhere. It's going to be on any stores or you can get it at shootergenics.com or you can get it, you know, any kind of outlet.
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:29.480]  The one thing that's good about the physical copy of the album is that it comes with these archetype cards.
[3:34:29.480 --> 3:34:36.480]  There's like six different cards. There's one in each package and when we're playing shows live, when we're playing a headlining show,
[3:34:36.480 --> 3:34:47.480]  we're going to pick a number for every show and anyone who has that card on them can come back and hang out with me in the band and have time to talk and ask questions or whatever.
[3:34:47.480 --> 3:34:58.480]  So we're kind of doing a lot of things to give people the incentive to buy the actual physical copy of the album as well as trying to give them opportunities to hang out with me in the band.
[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:02.480]  Well, I can't wait till you come to Austin. You think you might be at Emos in April, you were saying?
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:08.480]  Yeah, we're looking at it. I don't think we've confirmed the date quite yet, but I think April, we're going to be at Emos.
[3:35:08.480 --> 3:35:16.480]  So, you know, if they just stick to our MySpace, which is MySpace slash shootergenics or shootergenics.com, they'll be able to keep in with the dates.
[3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:19.480]  And you bet when we come down to Austin, we'll be giving you a ring.
[3:35:19.480 --> 3:35:24.480]  I think we're going to talk to you guys at a Coachella also when we do that festival.
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:29.480]  Well, that's awesome because this is not just a radio show. It's also an internet TV show.
[3:35:29.480 --> 3:35:32.480]  So we can come down to do a video interview with you about the album.
[3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:34.480]  That'd be great, man. I would love to.
[3:35:34.480 --> 3:35:41.480]  Again, Shooter Jennings, the only son of legendary Waylon Jennings fighting the New World Order, working with Stephen King.
[3:35:41.480 --> 3:35:45.480]  Stephen King knew about the global takeover back when I was in diapers.
[3:35:45.480 --> 3:35:48.480]  He wrote The Running Man, what, in the late 1970s.
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:52.480]  He's got a new book out. I haven't read. It's called The Dome or The Bubble.
[3:35:52.480 --> 3:36:01.480]  Under the Dome because Orion just got it was saying how great it is all about a controlled society, a tracking grid, a police state.
[3:36:01.480 --> 3:36:06.480]  I'm told the movie Crazies that is out right now kind of dovetails with that.
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:10.480]  But it's great to know that Stephen King is obviously aware of what's happening.
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:13.480]  You were telling me to the guy that produced the audio. You talked to him.
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:17.480]  He's also a listener of the show and fully aware of what's going on.
[3:36:17.480 --> 3:36:20.480]  And that's the good news. We are really the majority.
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:29.480]  The Awakening's out there. The last domino to fall is all of us realizing that we are the majority, that we're not alone.
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:40.480]  And having more people like yourself, Shooter, come out, make a bold stand against MKUltra, the New World Order, the swine flu vaccine, the tyranny, the bankers, the of the messages in all these songs.
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:49.480]  It's incredible. You got cut off by the break when you're trying to talk about your whole view of the world we're in a few years from now that this album is warning people about.
[3:36:49.480 --> 3:36:51.480]  So hopefully, we don't have to go there.
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:55.480]  Yeah, man. That's exactly kind of the purpose.
[3:36:55.480 --> 3:37:06.480]  I'm not making anything up. Everything that was put into this piece of art or whatever was taken from what is really going on in the world.
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:11.480]  The things that you've been speaking out about and the things that other writers that I've read have been speaking out.
[3:37:11.480 --> 3:37:20.480]  I mean, even people like Manly P. Hall and, you know, of course, like I said, I've said about Ike. I mean, everybody will have formed their own opinion about him.
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:29.480]  I'm not an avid follower of Ike, but there was a book he had called, Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else with Illusion, which is where that title came from.
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:41.480]  And there's, you know, all of it for what it's worth is worth reading once and worth absorbing because there are things, there are messages in all of it that will improve everyone's life on a daily basis.
[3:37:41.480 --> 3:37:55.480]  And for me, the one big message that I received from all of this was the importance of family and spirituality and the closeness of the people around you because that's the world in which you really, at the end of the day, are going to thrive in.
[3:37:55.480 --> 3:38:03.480]  That's the only thing that matters and all because we all know the world is going to go down the crapper like the sovereignty of the United States has been being stripped away for years.
[3:38:03.480 --> 3:38:11.480]  So it's like, you know, if you're going to live by their rules, you're going to live by your rules. And the thing is, it's remembering that you have that choice.
[3:38:11.480 --> 3:38:20.480]  Absolutely. Let's talk about the message of some of the other tracks. What about don't feed the animals? What are you talking about there?
[3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:31.480]  Well, you know, that one is, you know, I don't kind of focus on a lot of different aspects of society these days, I think. And I think for that one, don't feed the animals.
[3:38:31.480 --> 3:38:49.480]  Really, even though the lyrics are really kind of about me and they are really about me and Dre, but the nature of it is just the animalistic nature of people and how really, you know, when I found myself becoming
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:56.480]  a night person, you know, if you want to say I like throughout my life. And nowadays, now that I have a daughter, I'm much more grounded.
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:39:05.480]  But I think with that song, she and I both met in a scenario in which we had kind of thrown ourselves into a more dangerous lifestyle.
[3:39:05.480 --> 3:39:26.480]  And it's kind of dictating that story through the environment of the fact that, you know, the self-culture to America is very dangerous in moments. And there's a lot of wild aspects to kind of when you're living in a worldly kind of state of mind.
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:29.480]  It's sold as sexy, but it ends in destruction.
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:34.480]  Exactly, exactly. And that's really kind of what that song is about.
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:44.480]  All of us are weak, none of us are perfect, but really piety, love, grace, that is what uplifts you to a point where you're really awakened and can see what's happening.
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:55.480]  And then you see how silly it is to get a bottle of Jack Daniels and drink half of it. We're not here judging anybody. I've not been perfect. The whole point is we're reaching towards something better.
[3:39:55.480 --> 3:40:04.480]  Exactly. I think, you know, I mean, I still drink and I still hang out and things like that. But I think in my life, I've realized that I definitely had it.
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:19.480]  I was very irresponsible when it came to myself. Other people, I would always be, you know, responsible too. But when it came to taking care of myself, I think it took me having a child to make me realize I can't live recklessly because it's doing her to serve her.
[3:40:19.480 --> 3:40:26.480]  Yeah, don't feed the animals, don't feed the troll within. What about lights in the sky? That's a MK Ultra type stuff?
[3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:47.480]  Yeah, that whole song, it started out as a love song and it got a little too creepy and it turned into this song that basically, you know, deals with the kind of programmed people of our, you know, even to the Charlie Mansons and those kind of guys in the world, these people that are...
[3:40:47.480 --> 3:40:49.480]  Oh, that was definitely staged, you know.
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:57.480]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, so I think it's, you know, that that song is kind of a, from a Patsy's perspective, kind of a...
[3:40:57.480 --> 3:41:00.480]  What about Everything is Illusion? Everything else is Illusion?
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:08.480]  Everything else is Illusion. Like I said, the title came from a hike book, but that song, now it was co-written by a guy named Matt White.
[3:41:08.480 --> 3:41:16.480]  He's been a great band from Brooklyn called Earl Greyhound, one of my favorite new bands, and he and I have become friends, and he was staying at my house.
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:25.480]  And also the bit about the Carol S. Pearson book, The Hero Within, that was inspired by Matt because he was in my house reading that book, and he kind of turned me on to that.
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:27.480]  But Matt and I kind of went into...
[3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:28.480]  What book was that?
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:31.480]  It's called The Hero Within. It's a book from, like, 74.
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:33.480]  Oh, sure, I've read that, absolutely.
[3:41:33.480 --> 3:41:45.480]  Yeah, like, so he's like kind of my partner in all this. We kind of have been very into studying all these kind of different facets of kind of secret societies, and he called all these different things like that.
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:56.480]  And so he, when I had done that song, we had gotten the music done. Dave Cobb and I, the producer I worked with, and Matt was over, and I said, hey, man, help me finish this song, because I had the ending together, and I kind of needed...
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:42:01.480]  And it was his idea to kind of make the vocal like a Negro spiritual kind of thing.
[3:42:01.480 --> 3:42:08.480]  And what the song is about is really adhering to people that lose themselves adhering to society's standards.
[3:42:08.480 --> 3:42:11.480]  Like, the first verse is about a woman who kind of...
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:21.480]  I mean, it's loosely based on this concept, but the first one kind of is a woman who basically plows through the world on love and other people's love.
[3:42:21.480 --> 3:42:24.480]  And the second verse is about a guy who...
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:31.480]  And she's continually falling because she's not in any kind of state, like she hasn't found a solid place.
[3:42:31.480 --> 3:42:40.480]  And the second verse is about a guy who spends his whole life working so hard because the world has put so many pressures on him that he basically misses his...
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:46.480]  Trying to make money for his family, and he basically misses his family, but in the process.
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:50.480]  So the different ways were bound up in the world's bondage.
[3:42:50.480 --> 3:42:57.480]  And the thing that you're supposed... Money and status, all those things, you can nurture those all you want.
[3:42:57.480 --> 3:43:01.480]  But at the end of the day, when you die alone, you don't have anything.
[3:43:01.480 --> 3:43:05.480]  It's like the thing you need to nurture is the love and family.
[3:43:05.480 --> 3:43:08.480]  Very powerful. Very powerful. Shooter Jennings.
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:11.480]  What about Wake Up? We're about to play most of Wake Up.
[3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:23.480]  Well, it kind of does speak for itself. That was a track that was me really going into a trance state about how the TV and how they lie.
[3:43:23.480 --> 3:43:28.480]  And I'm watching all the hunger strikes. I mean, not hunger strikes, I'm sorry.
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:33.480]  I'm watching all the hungry nations, these people dying.
[3:43:33.480 --> 3:43:38.480]  They're saying there's food depletion and things like that, and we know that this isn't the case.
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:42.480]  It's like, you know, they will keep the food and starve these people in.
[3:43:42.480 --> 3:43:47.480]  Is this the song that points out there's plenty of food, the earth isn't dying, it's all artificial?
[3:43:47.480 --> 3:43:49.480]  This is that song. Yes.
[3:43:49.480 --> 3:43:52.480]  Okay, let's go ahead and play it now. Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:43:52.480 --> 3:43:55.480]  Wake Up by Shooter Jennings and Hierophant.
[3:43:55.480 --> 3:43:58.480]  The album is Black Ribbons, available tomorrow everywhere.
[3:43:58.480 --> 3:44:20.480]  ShooterJennings.com. I'm Alex Jones and FullWars.com.
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:35.480]  That TV in the corner. That's their greatest tune.
[3:44:35.480 --> 3:44:41.480]  They poison your mind with your child.
[3:44:41.480 --> 3:44:49.480]  With their fear and their guilt and their blues.
[3:44:49.480 --> 3:44:59.480]  They teach you that you're just a number.
[3:44:59.480 --> 3:45:05.480]  As they program you in school.
[3:45:05.480 --> 3:45:12.480]  So by the time you're out in their world on your own.
[3:45:12.480 --> 3:45:22.480]  You've been trained not to bite the hand of the crew.
[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:46.480]  Wake Up!
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:46:02.480]  Wake Up by Shooter Jennings and Hierophant.
[3:46:02.480 --> 3:46:18.480]  Don't believe that the system is fake.
[3:46:18.480 --> 3:46:34.480]  Starving will kill or be fed. And they'll try to turn me against you.
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:50.480]  I've been stroke and I'll be cucked from without the buffers being cucked from within.
[3:46:50.480 --> 3:47:15.480]  Don't let them get you down.
[3:47:15.480 --> 3:47:20.480]  I want to play more of Wake Up with Shooter Jennings but we're running out of time.
[3:47:20.480 --> 3:47:26.480]  Unfortunately ladies and gentlemen and the talk radio character fight the New World Order on this album.
[3:47:26.480 --> 3:47:31.480]  He runs out of time and that's another message. You never know how much time you've got left.
[3:47:31.480 --> 3:47:38.480]  So hug your wife, your husband, your children and realize that it's that humanity that's important and the globalist.
[3:47:38.480 --> 3:47:44.480]  The controllers do want to separate us from our humanity so they can control the planet.
[3:47:44.480 --> 3:47:52.480]  If you're an awake person who's spiritually connected, that means that you will be able to dominate your own destiny.
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:47:56.480]  And the globalist wants you as a mindless zombie, slave, Shooter.
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:48:14.480]  It's true man. People are the master of their own destiny and with it between the TV and the newspapers and the things out there in the world, they do a pretty good job of sifting through what information they want people to know.
[3:48:14.480 --> 3:48:27.480]  And that's why some of these people that talk about how Americans are dumb, that's one of the biggest things that people try to put out there that's why we can't, you know, we're sheep.
[3:48:27.480 --> 3:48:37.480]  And the reason why that we're uninformed or we're kind of over-informed in certain ways about certain things to where they shift the public opinion.
[3:48:37.480 --> 3:48:46.480]  Exactly. We're filled with petty factoids about baseball or popular stuff that doesn't matter.
[3:48:46.480 --> 3:48:53.480]  And we have been the major experiment, the U.S. and England, of the model of mind control now being deployed worldwide.
[3:48:53.480 --> 3:49:06.480]  We were the greatest, smartest, the most inventions and we have now been turned into, in many cases, just like the zombified biological androids and that's what wake up is, you're saying break out of it.
[3:49:06.480 --> 3:49:24.480]  Yeah, exactly. You know, you are in control. They are not in control. It's like bring yourself to a higher level of consciousness and spirituality and whether that be religious or not, you know, it's really about being in touch with the world.
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:36.480]  And even like guys like Eckhart Tolle have the right idea, like they talk about, you know, you have to stop and smell the roses, you have to stop and pay attention to the beauty around you because you let all that go.
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:47.480]  You know, people in the celebrity culture, that's why the FU I'm Famous song on the record, it's really a sarcastic jab at our celebrity culture because it's like that is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life, you know.
[3:49:47.480 --> 3:49:59.480]  Absolutely, Shooter, final segment straight ahead. We're going out with God Bless Alabama from the album, Black Ribbons, available at ShooterGenics.com. I'm Alex Jones.

[3:52:02.480 --> 3:52:10.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:10.480 --> 3:52:15.480]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[3:52:15.480 --> 3:52:21.480]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[3:52:21.480 --> 3:52:26.480]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.480 --> 3:52:36.480]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:36.480 --> 3:52:42.480]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:52:42.480 --> 3:52:50.480]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:52:50.480 --> 3:53:01.480]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[3:56:38.480 --> 3:56:48.480]  I just appreciate you having me on the air and supporting the record. You know, we are getting some friction from mainstream media sources, which I didn't, didn't have to say I expected.
[3:56:48.480 --> 3:56:54.480]  But, you know, having somebody like you on board to help get the word out there is invaluable.

[3:57:02.480 --> 3:57:09.480]  But I don't know how much I can say now, but once the show was a hit, top show on True TV, that's when they got the friction.
[3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:12.480]  So I think that kind of made it through the radar.
[3:57:12.480 --> 3:57:21.480]  But there's a lot of pressure on musicians, on activists, on artists, on movie stars, on TV people, because they know the culture is obsessed with it.
[3:57:21.480 --> 3:57:28.480]  And when they see the culture start going away from their mind control, they get upset. That's why it's important to support this album.
