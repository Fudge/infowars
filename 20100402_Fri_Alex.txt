[08:33.640 --> 08:39.080]  advisor advocates state-run propaganda megaphone to counter alternative
[08:39.080 --> 08:44.080]  media that dovetails with Obama's favorite for Supreme Court Justice
[08:44.080 --> 08:50.000]  Sunstein wants to ban guns free speech we have his actual quotes of course that
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.080]  dovetails with dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerence and tortured for
[08:55.080 --> 09:01.400]  any reason the government wishes and we have Barack Obama talking to CBS news
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.400]  about all the hate on talk radio and he has all these different people in his
[09:05.400 --> 09:11.320]  administration calling for restrictions of free speech the cyber security bill
[09:11.320 --> 09:18.400]  has passed the house it is in the u.s. Senate it is in the United States Senate
[09:18.400 --> 09:22.920]  even in the Associated Press they admit the president could completely shut the
[09:22.920 --> 09:29.480]  web down if he so chooses all of this is just icing on the cake though this is
[09:29.480 --> 09:33.280]  happening because they've already robbed 28 plus trillion dollars from the
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.320]  American people the last year and a half and the federal government controlled
[09:37.320 --> 09:42.680]  by criminal offshore banks and corporations is now saying they want
[09:42.680 --> 09:49.120]  your private pension funds and government pension funds as well we're
[09:49.120 --> 09:52.400]  gonna go over the latest developments in the battle against the government
[09:52.400 --> 09:59.600]  takeover slash corporate takeover of health care Obama to crush economy with
[09:59.600 --> 10:05.120]  massive co2 tax as early as next week abandoning all loyalty the democratic
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.200]  process the nation holds dear president Obama has made the decision that getting
[10:10.200 --> 10:14.280]  energy tax legislation through Congress with the approval without the approval
[10:14.280 --> 10:19.600]  of the American people is just too much of a pain to bother with he doesn't eat
[10:19.600 --> 10:22.960]  our approval or the Senate's approval and steady will have the EPA declare as
[10:22.960 --> 10:26.680]  early as next week that co2 is a dangerous global warming gas and we'll
[10:26.680 --> 10:29.960]  start regulating its emissions immediately with massive taxes on coal
[10:29.960 --> 10:34.680]  powered energy factories homes the electricity you receive not just on the
[10:34.680 --> 10:38.480]  plant that they pass the cost on to you but another tax on your like your
[10:38.480 --> 10:43.240]  electricity Obama's promise to open up vast stretches of ocean on the east
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.680]  coast and Gulf of Mexico to energy exploration is simply a ruse to soften
[10:47.680 --> 10:53.840]  up the public for soon to be announced or conan regulations and there's more to
[10:53.840 --> 10:58.440]  it than that the Russian in government Chinese government announced multi
[10:58.440 --> 11:03.120]  billion dollar per year in fact Russia saying it's a 40 plus billion dollar
[11:03.120 --> 11:08.840]  program to explore natural gas and oil in the Atlantic off the US coast in
[11:08.840 --> 11:14.160]  international waters and in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean and so now
[11:14.160 --> 11:18.040]  Obama saying okay I'll let some companies based on the US there aren't
[11:18.040 --> 11:21.400]  many go ahead and start drilling whoever wanted to drill out there could
[11:21.400 --> 11:26.720]  already do it our government was banning our companies from engaging in
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.360]  that the areas that they have now marked out in the Gulf of Mexico and the
[11:30.360 --> 11:35.920]  Atlantic are upwards of 50 miles out the US only declares 12 miles as being
[11:35.920 --> 11:41.600]  part of its territorial waters so we're going to be going over that and
[11:41.600 --> 11:47.400]  mission completed in California for the deindustrialization brigade I mean how
[11:47.400 --> 11:50.240]  many UN officials how many NASA officials how many Department of
[11:50.240 --> 11:54.000]  Energy officials have said just in the last few months they want a post
[11:54.000 --> 12:01.640]  industrial deindustrialized country that is the goal California's last auto plant
[12:01.640 --> 12:06.840]  shut its doors today the last car has rolled off the production lines at
[12:06.840 --> 12:12.200]  California's sole auto plant workers are trickling out of the new United
[12:12.200 --> 12:17.440]  Motor Manufacturing Plant in Fairmont as they completed their task and the plant
[12:17.440 --> 12:23.720]  ready to shut down nearby job centers have been set up to help the newly
[12:23.720 --> 12:30.440]  unemployed figure out their benefits and get jobs at McDonald's it continues the
[12:30.440 --> 12:34.960]  plant made Toyota Tacoma trucks and Corolla sedans the last Tacoma rolled
[12:34.960 --> 12:39.840]  off the assembly line last week and Corolla production ended Thursday see
[12:39.840 --> 12:44.120]  Toyota dared to actually build plants here instead of the US companies
[12:44.120 --> 12:49.600]  building them in China and Mexico so they had to be set up with the industrial
[12:49.600 --> 12:52.880]  espionage and they have so don't worry you're gonna lose your job now it's fun
[12:52.880 --> 12:57.760]  to hate the Japanese and don't get your job now the plant began 25 years ago as
[12:57.760 --> 13:04.360]  a joint venture between Toyota Motor Corps and General Motors company GM
[13:04.360 --> 13:07.480]  pulled out last year in Toyota later announced it would halt production
[13:07.480 --> 13:13.320]  eliminating an estimated 4,700 jobs state officials are pursuing federal
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.120]  grants to help those impacted by the closure yes they will tax whoever still
[13:18.120 --> 13:21.280]  has a job to give it to people that don't have jobs which will drive up even
[13:21.280 --> 13:25.560]  more debt for the government which is exactly what the private central banks
[13:25.560 --> 13:32.360]  want continuing out of news 11 and in Atlanta anti-Obama billboards appear on
[13:32.360 --> 13:36.360]  metro highways this is what everybody should do even if you can only afford
[13:36.360 --> 13:41.120]  one billboard they're cheap comparatively speaking with the economy imploding
[13:41.120 --> 13:44.560]  that's why in Texas more than half the billboards I see your government
[13:44.560 --> 13:49.800]  propaganda anti-gun anti-family pro-police state brainwashing billboards
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.240]  because most companies don't have money to buy billboards anymore so you can get
[13:53.240 --> 13:58.440]  them for dirt cheap perhaps we should do a billboard initiative and put up a few
[13:58.440 --> 14:04.640]  dozen billboards nationwide because then it generates local news coverage and
[14:04.640 --> 14:12.040]  continues to undermine this un-American Barry Sitaro known as Barack H. Obama
[14:12.040 --> 14:17.240]  everything we can do to expose this criminal and all his unconstitutional
[14:17.240 --> 14:21.680]  activity is absolutely essential and it's starting to hurt these criminals
[14:21.680 --> 14:27.480]  sure he's a puppet but he is the figurehead he is the masthead he is the
[14:27.480 --> 14:34.000]  front person the pitch man selling this agenda and by fully destroying him
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.840]  politically and fully annihilating politically the Democrats that are
[14:38.840 --> 14:42.040]  butchering our bill of rights and Constitution we can take this country
[14:42.040 --> 14:44.560]  back and that's why they're screaming bloody murder that's why they're gonna
[14:44.560 --> 14:50.320]  stage terror attacks all over the United States and worldwide to be blamed on
[14:50.320 --> 14:57.840]  patriot groups because they are beginning to get very very desperate they
[14:57.840 --> 15:01.400]  can't beat us politically they can't beat our information with their lies and
[15:01.400 --> 15:04.600]  rhetoric and so they are going to attempt to run false flags and what do
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.360]  you think the Joe Stack situation was definitely false flag the Pentagon
[15:08.360 --> 15:11.880]  shooting definitely false flag most of the Democratic Party office is being
[15:11.880 --> 15:15.600]  attacked we know some of those have been confirmed to be staged by DNC
[15:15.600 --> 15:19.720]  operatives that's Denver Post and other major publications we know a week and a
[15:19.720 --> 15:24.080]  half ago the black congressional caucus marching through the tea parties no one
[15:24.080 --> 15:27.640]  called him the n-word no one said they were gonna kill him no one spit on them
[15:27.640 --> 15:31.440]  all the video angles are out there were over a weekend to a ten thousand dollar
[15:31.440 --> 15:34.960]  reward that a group put out for anybody that could show video of this with
[15:34.960 --> 15:38.640]  literally hundreds if not thousands of cameras in the tens of thousands of
[15:38.640 --> 15:45.520]  demonstrators and no one can show it and the the supposed incident is all on
[15:45.520 --> 15:49.400]  video for multiple angles and nothing like that was said they were saying kill
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.160]  the bill that got turned into we're gonna kill you no one said the n-word no
[15:54.160 --> 16:02.400]  one spit on them that is a false flag and AP Reuters McClatchy MSNBC CNN I
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.600]  was watching both CNN and MSNBC a little bit last night about 20 minutes a
[16:06.600 --> 16:11.480]  piece and just when I spot checked them they were saying the horrible n-word
[16:11.480 --> 16:16.320]  being screamed by the racist tea parties the horrible spitting the horrible
[16:16.320 --> 16:23.560]  saying kill kill all lies and this Atari situation is clearly a false flag we're
[16:23.560 --> 16:27.600]  gonna be going over that later in the broadcast evidence that what I said on
[16:27.600 --> 16:31.200]  Monday was true that these people were set up that there were informants
[16:31.200 --> 16:38.080]  inside now why would several other supposed militia groups in Michigan
[16:38.080 --> 16:42.240]  and other states criticize me Monday for saying that why would anyone criticize
[16:42.240 --> 16:50.080]  me for saying this group was set up and are innocent why would so-called
[16:50.080 --> 16:54.480]  militia people not want you to know that you're being infiltrated because
[16:54.480 --> 16:58.720]  they're either morons or their feds think about that think about the
[16:58.720 --> 17:03.480]  magnitude of back in August of last year that I singled out the Atari
[17:03.480 --> 17:08.760]  militia and said they're being set up for a fall look out and I got one of their
[17:08.760 --> 17:14.200]  leaders on pale horse sickles is his real name and told him if you're not a
[17:14.200 --> 17:18.080]  fed you're being handled by feds you better watch your butt now we have the
[17:18.080 --> 17:23.360]  federal affidavit we have the the detainment hearing while they prepare
[17:23.360 --> 17:28.400]  the final charges came out in court yesterday I have that out of out of
[17:28.400 --> 17:31.520]  Detroit news in fact I didn't see that in my print out here I am do that
[17:31.520 --> 17:38.840]  Detroit news and in that article it points out and the reporters were in
[17:38.840 --> 17:42.920]  the courtroom that the feds played a tape where they just like I want to pull
[17:42.920 --> 17:45.280]  the quote up where they said yeah we've got to do something about this new
[17:45.280 --> 17:52.600]  order takeover we got to take action and that supposedly is the reason that
[17:52.600 --> 17:59.560]  they have now been arrested for thought crimes and the federal affidavit
[17:59.560 --> 18:04.480]  admits that they had an FBI agent inside the group and an informant who has
[18:04.480 --> 18:08.400]  been arrested but just for their safety and that they're going to drop the
[18:08.400 --> 18:13.560]  charges later once people aren't paying attention to this always the same and we
[18:13.560 --> 18:18.800]  don't know who that is but I have my suspicions in fact normally in a group
[18:18.800 --> 18:24.680]  they're setting up there's nine members I'd say four or five or feds what do they
[18:24.680 --> 18:27.920]  do they get somebody on some other charges years previous and they say you
[18:27.920 --> 18:32.840]  work for us now that you know they tried to do that with Randy Weaver he needed
[18:32.840 --> 18:38.520]  money for more than a year the federal informant VATF actual agent begged him
[18:38.520 --> 18:43.160]  and said I'll give you $2,000 to just saw off the shotgun for me he finally did
[18:43.160 --> 18:47.800]  it and the rest was history they went and raided his home shot his wife shot his
[18:47.800 --> 18:52.360]  son shot the dog to create the illusion that there were all these dangerous
[18:52.360 --> 18:57.000]  domestic groups out there that had to be dealt with and he was a former green
[18:57.000 --> 19:03.280]  beret and so they could demonize former veterans it's nothing but a cutout for
[19:03.280 --> 19:11.000]  media propaganda now imagine if I was around politically back in 1993 92 when
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.480]  that went down late 1992 and I would have got on air and said Randy Weaver was
[19:18.480 --> 19:23.680]  set up he was infiltrated you would see the feds come out as patriot leaders and
[19:23.680 --> 19:29.400]  say Alex Jones is a fed nobody set up Weaver he's fighting a holy battle against
[19:29.400 --> 19:35.320]  the government don't you see the alarm bells going off how obvious is that
[19:35.320 --> 19:39.160]  because we're trying to stop violence we're trying to stop provocaturing
[19:39.160 --> 19:43.160]  actions we know we're winning politically peacefully right now and our
[19:43.160 --> 19:47.400]  numbers are swelling they want to try to shut down free speech shut down the web
[19:47.400 --> 19:52.800]  and they want to get their physical war going now with us before we have time to
[19:52.800 --> 19:56.760]  wake up the maximum number and then if the feds want to get violent well we
[19:56.760 --> 20:00.240]  defend ourselves and we win

[24:24.480 --> 24:31.520]  Williamson County coming up later in the broadcast today I mean this is
[24:31.520 --> 24:40.280]  incredible incredible isn't even the word I have the CPS slash police report and
[24:40.280 --> 24:45.360]  it says reason for taking the children parents are unsuitable and create an
[24:45.360 --> 24:50.680]  environment where the children believe the government is out to harm them well
[24:50.680 --> 24:56.360]  if that's the case all children a hundred years ago would have been taken from
[24:56.360 --> 25:02.000]  their parents but we didn't have a CPS because that is an American tradition
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.360]  that is an American value to only trust your family and don't just blindly trust
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.160]  the government I had the Dr. Frederick Whitehurst the former head of the FBI
[25:11.160 --> 25:16.320]  crime lab on two days ago and he said criminals have taken over almost every
[25:16.320 --> 25:20.480]  key position in local and federal government he said a lot of police
[25:20.480 --> 25:24.840]  officers and FBI agents are some of the best people in the world and I agree
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.560]  with him there are good people that get involved and then they get punished but
[25:29.560 --> 25:34.320]  more and more the higher ups is Dr. Frederick Whitehurst FBI agent lawyer
[25:34.320 --> 25:40.160]  scientist chemist as he pointed out now we've reached a level of tyranny where
[25:40.160 --> 25:43.600]  the criminals at the higher levels are kicking out the good people and
[25:43.600 --> 25:52.240]  recruiting more and more evil and I don't know what other term you use than
[25:52.240 --> 25:57.880]  wicked evil corrupt for Williamson County I mean I see articles all the time
[25:57.880 --> 26:01.480]  where somebody doesn't return a blockbuster video for a week and a half
[26:01.480 --> 26:05.760]  and they get arrested or a library book they forget they lose it we've all done
[26:05.760 --> 26:09.800]  that I was going through videos the other day and found a video from a video
[26:09.800 --> 26:13.480]  store about five years ago and I didn't didn't know I hadn't brought it in they
[26:13.480 --> 26:21.840]  never called me I have no idea why I haven't I mean should I go to jail for
[26:21.840 --> 26:25.440]  something worth about ten dollars and it's not conscious meanwhile the illegal
[26:25.440 --> 26:28.880]  aliens are above the law Williamson County doesn't arrest illegal aliens for
[26:28.880 --> 26:32.680]  drunk driving and not having IDs they're all part of that same system but
[26:32.680 --> 26:37.040]  citizens I saw an article yesterday in the AP how nationwide police have been
[26:37.040 --> 26:40.920]  ordered to raise their quotas after decades of denying they had quotas for
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.920]  tickets now they're saying don't give people their five-mile cushion you
[26:45.920 --> 26:50.400]  notice how cops sit at the bottom of Hills I drive down 360 every day and I
[26:50.400 --> 26:54.680]  have to remember as I go down this hill is I'll be going about 60 to watch it
[26:54.680 --> 26:58.880]  or I'll go 6570 because of the going downhill and there's almost always
[26:58.880 --> 27:06.480]  motorcycle cops Austin Travis County Sheriff's deputies DPS just because they
[27:06.480 --> 27:10.600]  know that's a middle-class area and the people are just gonna pay the tickets
[27:10.600 --> 27:18.480]  and they're there constantly they're there to raise money but now Barry
[27:18.480 --> 27:23.680]  Cooper dared to go run stings against Williamson County he's been on national
[27:23.680 --> 27:37.520]  television with the stings and they then rated him police raid never get busted
[27:37.520 --> 27:44.760]  HQ Barry Cooper arrested and then here's the new article police teaching kids to
[27:44.760 --> 27:49.120]  mistrust government makes couple unsuitable parents that's why the
[27:49.120 --> 28:00.520]  children were taken I have the Williamson County confidential document this
[28:00.520 --> 28:03.280]  was given to us by the Coopers this document contains information may
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.640]  confidential it should not be released to unauthorized persons while the family
[28:08.640 --> 28:13.040]  can release whatever they want Cooper Candace so they want to do this in the
[28:13.040 --> 28:20.520]  dark the stuff they do releasable copy volume one can you imagine this is the
[28:20.520 --> 28:33.960]  releasable that can you imagine what's in the secret copy and on page four it
[28:33.960 --> 28:42.800]  says that if children do not know how to dial 911 they may be taken and it goes
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.880]  on please explain your current concerns regarding supervision of the
[28:46.880 --> 28:51.960]  children parents this is all it says parents are unsuitable and create an

[28:59.640 --> 29:04.000]  me tell you something when I went to Rockwall middle school and high school
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.160]  they had police informants that would try to sell kids marijuana they just beg
[29:09.160 --> 29:12.600]  you even when I was in the sixth seventh eighth grade I learned about marijuana
[29:12.600 --> 29:19.720]  from the police dealers and they were constantly trying to sell me pot
[29:19.720 --> 29:22.680]  everybody else and I'd say maybe a third of the kids they busted put on
[29:22.680 --> 29:28.160]  probation because their operatives would sell them a joint my dad told me if
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.120]  they ever bring you into the office and say you've been buying drugs which I
[29:32.120 --> 29:37.120]  wasn't do not talk and they called me in with the police and everybody else in
[29:37.120 --> 29:41.480]  the seventh grade were screaming at me and then they were shocked they said I
[29:41.480 --> 29:45.160]  was the only kid they'd ever known that kept his mouth shut nowadays they would
[29:45.160 --> 29:51.320]  have just taken me for that because I'm a real American and you're not we're on

[33:10.080 --> 33:15.320]  them is a sneak peek and trailer comboed it's over five minutes long you're
[33:15.320 --> 33:21.000]  gonna see part of the section of police state for the rise of FEMA where they're
[33:21.000 --> 33:24.960]  in Pittsburgh and the Pentagon puts out a press release that you can come talk
[33:24.960 --> 33:30.560]  to their public affairs officer their PAO about the 4,000 troops that we're
[33:30.560 --> 33:33.840]  gonna be deploying on the streets of Pittsburgh so our guys show up are
[33:33.840 --> 33:38.560]  incredibly polite the military is not polite they look at them with hate and
[33:38.560 --> 33:44.240]  are rude and have rude tones they then follow them from the edge of the base
[33:44.240 --> 33:48.360]  and call the police on them and so they were sneaking around and ran from them
[33:48.360 --> 33:54.160]  then the police said that we're gonna put you on a terrorist database I called
[33:54.160 --> 33:59.760]  the police commander myself and talked to him on the phone and said we are human
[33:59.760 --> 34:03.680]  beings how dare you threaten to put my employees on a terror list he said well
[34:03.680 --> 34:07.800]  we're not gonna do that now and and I said that's right we're human beings we
[34:07.800 --> 34:14.080]  have wives and families we have children we're allowed to go cover your event do
[34:14.080 --> 34:18.080]  you realize how evil it is officer to try to destroy people's lives like we're
[34:18.080 --> 34:23.760]  not even human beings you can't just frame us like we aren't humans but that
[34:23.760 --> 34:27.560]  goes back to what dr. Frederick Whitehurst talked about blew the whistle on
[34:27.560 --> 34:32.240]  that system framing thousands of people a year it just came out the San Francisco
[34:32.240 --> 34:37.760]  police office framed thousands and thousands of people they just take a
[34:37.760 --> 34:44.000]  file out and stamp that they're guilty and falsify the test and what Whitehurst
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.080]  said it's mainly laziness they don't even want to do the test that's why the
[34:48.080 --> 34:53.920]  labs have over 95% in the numbers we've seen nationwide guilty they don't even
[34:53.920 --> 34:58.160]  do the test ladies and gentlemen and then if it is corrupt cops or politicians
[34:58.160 --> 35:02.480]  or somebody they then cover up the evidence remember Fami Malik the state
[35:02.480 --> 35:06.440]  medical examiner that Clinton hired people would have their arms and legs and
[35:06.440 --> 35:11.560]  heads chopped off and be have gasoline poured on them and be found in a dump
[35:11.560 --> 35:15.680]  they would say that people had cut their own arms and legs off or that kids had
[35:15.680 --> 35:19.640]  sawed their own arms and legs and heads off and shot themselves who'd seen
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.200]  government drug dealing and Mina and police officers that were investigating
[35:24.200 --> 35:29.000]  Clinton would be machine gunned off the road in two cases and Fami Malik would
[35:29.000 --> 35:36.040]  say that that was suicide or up in California Gary Webb shot twice in the
[35:36.040 --> 35:41.280]  head murdered and police said it was a suicide I mean what you come in my
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.440]  house and I'm hung up by meat hooks and my arms and legs are cut off and the
[35:45.440 --> 35:48.920]  news is going to say I committed suicide it's like that Palestinian
[35:48.920 --> 35:53.040]  professor in Austin we learned federal informants were manipulating his whole
[35:53.040 --> 35:57.840]  body was sliced up his guts ripped out torture wounds all over him his arms and
[35:57.840 --> 36:01.720]  legs bound behind him with duct tape and he supposedly threw himself in the
[36:01.720 --> 36:05.760]  middle of Lake Austin now known as Lady Bird Lake since the first lady died
[36:05.760 --> 36:10.160]  they renamed it it's really the Colorado River then they called it Lake Austin
[36:10.160 --> 36:13.840]  then they called it Town Lake and now it's called Lady Bird so whatever new
[36:13.840 --> 36:17.800]  name it's got this week the point is through himself and Lady Bird Bird Lake
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.160]  and then the Imam called me because they got the body and then the police
[36:22.160 --> 36:27.440]  report admitted bound his own hands and feet oh sure he did ladies and gentlemen
[36:27.440 --> 36:32.600]  this is how stupid they think you are this is how corrupt they are at the top
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.040]  that they can do whatever they want they can take your pension funds they can
[36:37.040 --> 36:41.720]  pass government takeover of health care they can do whatever they want it is an
[36:41.720 --> 36:49.240]  armed criminal camp moving against the American people and as Dr. Frederick
[36:49.240 --> 36:52.720]  Whitehurst said when FBI agents and police try to do the right thing they
[36:52.720 --> 37:01.120]  get set up or they get arrested or they get fired or they get demoted this is
[37:01.120 --> 37:11.160]  what America has turned into now here's another huge piece of information this
[37:11.160 --> 37:18.680]  is huge I have been to events all over the United States and I've been to
[37:18.680 --> 37:25.840]  events in Canada and I have seen anarchists come and go with the police I
[37:25.840 --> 37:32.480]  first saw this in 1999 at the Fortune 500 conference Mike Hansen has got to dig
[37:32.480 --> 37:35.120]  this out he's been digging out old tapes from the TV show he's got them all
[37:35.120 --> 37:40.760]  almost all of them and putting them on the web we commend that but this did
[37:40.760 --> 37:46.560]  air many times on access TV in Austin in 1999 and I show up for a march of about
[37:46.560 --> 37:56.640]  2,000 people from the Texas Capitol down to the four seasons of the Fortune 500
[37:56.640 --> 38:04.160]  meeting globalist meeting and immediately these anarchist run over they
[38:04.160 --> 38:07.000]  were the older ones they were cops and informants these were not they're more
[38:07.000 --> 38:16.520]  on meth head you know kids that are you know basically rich kids who have their
[38:16.520 --> 38:23.760]  own trust funds who are there as useful idiots in a nice pool for the cops to
[38:23.760 --> 38:30.200]  set up and these cops come over dressed like anarchists and start shoving me and
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.720]  pushing me and this one redheaded one with a red beard leans into me because
[38:34.720 --> 38:40.120]  Mike was off of the camera about 10 feet away and says I'm gonna kill you and
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.840]  shoves his hands into my chest and I was smart and didn't hit him to notice he
[38:44.840 --> 38:53.160]  had two huge APD cops I mean these guys were like six five six two each arms the
[38:53.160 --> 38:57.320]  size of tree trunks I bet one of them could bench press 450 pounds these were
[38:57.320 --> 39:02.640]  not meth head trust fund kids and they had bandanas over their faces and black
[39:02.640 --> 39:07.360]  hats on and I said oh you're here with them and you're here with the guys up
[39:07.360 --> 39:10.560]  on the corner of that roof with video cameras and binoculars watching us right
[39:10.560 --> 39:15.320]  now and he said we are and this is our country and we're taking over so that
[39:15.320 --> 39:18.640]  guy was probably a master handler he looked like a southern property law
[39:18.640 --> 39:24.000]  center type operative kind of a big fat demonic hippie but he had his back up
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.760]  there and then the cops started trying to stir up trouble with other people and
[39:27.760 --> 39:29.880]  they couldn't get me to get in a fist fight with them as we're waiting to
[39:29.880 --> 39:34.920]  march and there's riot police lining the streets of Austin that they had just
[39:34.920 --> 39:38.760]  staged Seattle they were about to stage Austin as a beta test for the news
[39:38.760 --> 39:42.480]  cameras to say look any protest is violent we need riot police we need
[39:42.480 --> 39:47.400]  armored vehicles we need helicopters we need police with shotguns we need more
[39:47.400 --> 39:53.920]  than 300 police and riot year for a couple thousand demonstrators and then I
[39:53.920 --> 39:57.040]  started pointing out these are cops these are cops these are cops and about
[39:57.040 --> 40:00.840]  20 police run across the street including one of the commanders and he says
[40:00.840 --> 40:05.160]  they're all laughing like this is funny it's funny to provocateur it's funny it's
[40:05.160 --> 40:09.040]  all like hunting it's it we're not humans we're like a rat or something and
[40:09.040 --> 40:13.600]  they're a cat and they start laughing saying knock it off Jones and they pull
[40:13.600 --> 40:18.600]  the two guys out they go over in the DPS parking lot they're being debriefed by
[40:18.600 --> 40:22.640]  Austin police it's on camera they're Austin cops and since then this has been
[40:22.640 --> 40:27.160]  caught in Seattle and it's been caught in Ottawa a couple years ago and then the
[40:27.160 --> 40:31.200]  headline the Toronto Star was Royal Mounted Police stage riot posed as
[40:31.200 --> 40:35.400]  demonstrators we knew that when we saw the footage they were attacking cops it
[40:35.400 --> 40:42.160]  was staged look like WWF wrestling it was a false flag event just like the
[40:42.160 --> 40:45.240]  Democrats a week and a half ago going out and saying the n-word was being
[40:45.240 --> 40:49.720]  shouted and people were saying we're gonna kill you and people were saying
[40:49.720 --> 40:54.920]  that you know they were evil and spitting on them none of it was true now
[40:54.920 --> 41:00.760]  proven to be another false flag this is what everybody does not just the police
[41:00.760 --> 41:05.720]  not just the military not just the feds but now people in my general life I'm
[41:05.720 --> 41:10.360]  noticing I never knew how many people are just liars and lie about whoever they
[41:10.360 --> 41:17.120]  don't like it's like a hot dog stand or a hamburger shop who doesn't like their
[41:17.120 --> 41:20.320]  competition down the street so they lie and say oh they put horse meat in their
[41:20.320 --> 41:28.640]  food this is what an evil culture does we lie to ourselves then we lie about
[41:28.640 --> 41:34.080]  others we lie and say 50 million dead babies isn't bad that it is an abortion
[41:34.080 --> 41:42.840]  that it isn't death of children that it isn't in fantasy so I gave you some
[41:42.840 --> 41:48.720]  background there and then they inserted two more big cops not quite as big as
[41:48.720 --> 41:52.880]  the last two to try to stir stuff up and to run around with the crowd
[41:52.880 --> 41:57.840]  throughout the event so I've seen this firsthand over and over again I mean I
[41:57.840 --> 42:04.280]  was at Coving Bilderberg 2008 in Virginia in Chantilly suburb of
[42:04.280 --> 42:10.840]  Washington DC get there the first night I'm eating a hamburger in the bar group
[42:10.840 --> 42:15.760]  after group comes in and says Alex are you planning violence college age-looking
[42:15.760 --> 42:21.880]  people older cops security people I had security guys walk up on me and
[42:21.880 --> 42:25.400]  Jacobson at about 1130 or eating a hamburger it's the third group in 10
[42:25.400 --> 42:34.400]  minutes to come in and they had a security for the Marriott Center comes up
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.920]  with some other security men and he says we've had problems with people
[42:37.920 --> 42:45.840]  pulling fire alarms we've had problems with people trying to steal vases out
[42:45.840 --> 42:51.960]  of the hotel and I'm looking at him going okay nice thank you and I wasn't sure
[42:51.960 --> 42:55.840]  what that meant and then I told Jacobson go up set up a camera in the hotel room
[42:55.840 --> 43:00.520]  videotape me on coast to coast AM with a report in just a few minutes when they
[43:00.520 --> 43:06.880]  go live and have me on so I walk outside to smoke a cigarette yes I'm ashamed of
[43:06.880 --> 43:09.760]  it young people don't do it I start and stop all the time I've quit for four
[43:09.760 --> 43:13.120]  years before and I'm trying to quit again the point is I go outside to smoke
[43:13.120 --> 43:19.520]  a cigarette as you can't smoke in the hotel I fire it up and there's these
[43:19.520 --> 43:23.120]  security trucks there with maintenance men and they're going we're getting ready
[43:23.120 --> 43:31.840]  to do it at five after that's when we're gonna run the test and they're all
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.560]  there in front of me talking about how they're gonna run the emergency test and
[43:36.560 --> 43:39.120]  they talk and then they act all suspicious and walk away and I hear some
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.520]  more saying yes yes I've called the fire department to let them know and so I'm
[43:43.520 --> 43:47.000]  walking back down the hall I get in the elevator I'm going up to the third floor
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.920]  I'm wondering what's going on I walk into the hotel room there's my camera crew
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.960]  there's a see-think camera crew I sit down Tom Danheiser calls to have me go
[43:56.960 --> 44:11.240]  on the air and right as I go on coast to coast AM the alarm goes off and I'm
[44:11.240 --> 44:14.120]  start thinking wait a minute they were getting ready for a test down in the
[44:14.120 --> 44:20.320]  parking lot got security walked up to me and said we're having trouble with
[44:20.320 --> 44:25.200]  people pulling fire alarms and trying to steal things and so I get off the air
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.080]  with coast to coast get cut off from doing the 50 minute interview only did
[44:29.080 --> 44:33.520]  about five minutes I go downstairs everybody's out there with their
[44:33.520 --> 44:40.080]  luggage you've seen the footage of this and the Obama deception but we didn't
[44:40.080 --> 44:43.600]  have our camera rolling when he's ever telling us turn our cameras off we do
[44:43.600 --> 44:49.920]  have that on tape when the same head of security comes up and he says he says
[44:49.920 --> 44:55.160]  don't turn your cameras on again or I'm going to have you arrested and thrown
[44:55.160 --> 45:00.560]  out of the hotel and I said yes sir and I said it in a serious manner because I
[45:00.560 --> 45:04.400]  know when to hold them no one to fold them no one to back down I just wanted
[45:04.400 --> 45:06.920]  to be there for the arrival of the Bilderberg when they shut the hotel down
[45:06.920 --> 45:11.400]  the next day and wanted to gather intel while we were inside this is building up
[45:11.400 --> 45:16.200]  to something that's important and he looks at me right in front of Jacobson
[45:16.200 --> 45:24.120]  and he says Alex Jones I'm gonna f you up and just groans his teeth so there was
[45:24.120 --> 45:29.320]  some attempt to set us up for the fire drill but I think they ascertained that
[45:29.320 --> 45:35.720]  we were inside the room by then and there was some type of setup going on I'm
[45:35.720 --> 45:38.400]  not sure maybe they were trying to spook me because they knew they were already
[45:38.400 --> 45:43.080]  gonna test the fire drill and test emptying out the building and test getting
[45:43.080 --> 45:46.880]  the fire department there they were there in like two minutes I don't know I
[45:46.880 --> 45:51.080]  don't know to this day what that was all about but then the next day Bilderberg
[45:51.080 --> 45:54.280]  arrives they shut the hotel down I'm staying at another hotel I'm staying
[45:54.280 --> 46:00.440]  at the Hyatt and I'm sitting in the restaurant bar and these two big cops
[46:00.440 --> 46:04.320]  come in they kind of get in our group of people and they lean over the table while
[46:04.320 --> 46:07.480]  I'm eating another hamburger and they say Alex you want to attack the state
[46:07.480 --> 46:12.840]  department with us tomorrow and I pull out a video camera and start taping the
[46:12.840 --> 46:18.320]  guy and we really shuts up then and I said since when have I ever been violent
[46:18.320 --> 46:22.720]  you guys know I'm not violent you've assessed me he said I was just asking I
[46:22.720 --> 46:25.720]  thought we ought to go over and you know infiltrate and get into the state
[46:25.720 --> 46:30.840]  department and try to disrupt things from there later we learned it was a state
[46:30.840 --> 46:38.600]  department protection detail with the US Marine intelligence and NSA and CIA and
[46:38.600 --> 46:41.880]  secret service because Obama and Hillary were going to be there the next
[46:41.880 --> 46:47.240]  day and they were ready and you know what that guys probably not a complete
[46:47.240 --> 46:53.560]  criminal him and his partner because they if they were complete crux they would
[46:53.560 --> 46:57.440]  have just said Jones then said he was gonna attack the state department and I
[46:57.440 --> 47:02.400]  said knock it off I said knock it off I said you know I've never been violent
[47:02.400 --> 47:06.480]  well are you playing and then he just came right out and like admitted he was
[47:06.480 --> 47:09.440]  a cop he goes well you're not planning to infiltrate like you did Bohemian
[47:09.440 --> 47:17.200]  Grove and I said no no I'm not planning to try to sneak on to the grounds okay
[47:17.200 --> 47:21.120]  but I am gonna be out there bullhorning and I go you guys have all been
[47:21.120 --> 47:24.600]  listening to our telephone conversations you already know this and a few days
[47:24.600 --> 47:28.600]  later they called my wife up I'm on the phone with my wife it just ended
[47:28.600 --> 47:34.600]  Bilderberg just ended I'm eating at a steakhouse with the guys a little
[47:34.600 --> 47:39.440]  celebration for the successful mission and I call her and I talk about some
[47:39.440 --> 47:45.800]  private family issues whether and then she calls back crying two minutes later
[47:45.800 --> 47:53.080]  and said a woman called and said hi I'm calling for Alex Jones is there and she
[47:53.080 --> 47:56.680]  said no can I leave a message well who is this well I'm his wife the woman said
[47:56.680 --> 48:00.880]  well that's impossible we're getting married next month I'm pregnant and my
[48:00.880 --> 48:03.480]  wife started laughing and said that's ridiculous and then the woman said
[48:03.480 --> 48:08.000]  listen bleeper I know this private stuff about your family that I just said on
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.640]  the phone so it was the government they were tapping my phones it was very funny
[48:11.640 --> 48:18.920]  and and then they're so inhuman they're so evil they're so wicked they're so
[48:18.920 --> 48:24.560]  corrupt they're so hateful they're so lawless they would call a woman up who's
[48:24.560 --> 48:32.480]  not even involved in my operations other than some accounting and bring her into
[48:32.480 --> 48:36.520]  it I mean that's been a law of war even if I was an armed enemy which I'm not
[48:36.520 --> 48:39.880]  you'd leave my woman and my kids alone and you know why they've always had that
[48:39.880 --> 48:43.520]  rule because things get nasty if things get hot and this turns into a physical
[48:43.520 --> 48:47.880]  war do you want your family and children targeted I'm not saying I would ever do
[48:47.880 --> 48:51.760]  that I'm saying once you start doing that then it's fair game for a lot of
[48:51.760 --> 48:55.320]  people there's a reason for thousands of years in every culture you don't mess
[48:55.320 --> 48:59.640]  with women and children you don't mess with warriors women and children and
[48:59.640 --> 49:04.680]  I'm not even a physical warrior I'm a journalist an info warrior so it's not
[49:04.680 --> 49:07.040]  enough that you tried to set me up to send me to prison then you had to
[49:07.040 --> 49:14.920]  harass my wife there's a reason we never tortured because when our people get
[49:14.920 --> 49:22.400]  captured we don't want them to be tortured but every law of common sense
[49:22.400 --> 49:28.240]  and decency and honor is being violated you guys are the 180 degree opposite of
[49:28.240 --> 49:37.520]  George Washington just get that through your head you are 180 degree opposite you
[49:37.520 --> 49:40.800]  are cowards that bring women and children in just like Barry Cooper and his wife
[49:40.800 --> 49:44.600]  candy taking their children because they ran a sting against Williamson County
[49:44.600 --> 49:50.920]  you came and you took their children you took they have that their children
[49:50.920 --> 49:58.440]  because you wanted to win you wanted to be tough you wanted to punish people that
[49:58.440 --> 50:07.400]  exposed your corruption and I could just go on with story after story after
[50:07.400 --> 50:10.920]  story of what these people have done and the dirty tricks they've tried and the
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.480]  way they operate and the public is starting to really get wise the fact
[50:14.480 --> 50:18.040]  that the government is criminal oh but why they take their children oh they
[50:18.040 --> 50:21.040]  taught their children not to trust the government and then the government comes
[50:21.040 --> 50:24.000]  and takes the children what do you think the children think now for the rest
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.320]  their lives what lesson do you think they learned from this that mama and
[50:28.320 --> 50:33.480]  daddy told them the truth now we come back with all of that preface I want to
[50:33.480 --> 50:37.800]  now warn the tea partyers conservatives libertarians and gun owner groups we
[50:37.800 --> 50:40.680]  caught them in Austin running a false flag against the gun show staging fake
[50:40.680 --> 50:46.600]  arrest in there here's the latest prison planet calm feds prepare to use
[50:46.600 --> 50:51.600]  anarchist to provoke tea party violence this is coming up in the next two weeks
[50:51.600 --> 50:55.800]  as I predicted all the big anarchist groups are announcing it they're all
[50:55.800 --> 51:03.520]  Ford Foundation funded they are the enemy of America oh my sinuses they feel like
[51:03.520 --> 51:07.480]  they'll explode sinus pressure sinus headaches that keep you up at night you've
[51:07.480 --> 51:10.720]  struggled for years you've tried everything to get relief but your sinus

[55:32.440 --> 55:36.320]  is sufficient they want to discredit the tea parties and anyone criticizing
[55:36.320 --> 55:40.600]  the obama takeover they politically as russ limbaugh has astutely said may
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.320]  even try to suspend elections they know this is the biggest political suicide
[55:44.320 --> 55:48.880]  ever for the democrats there have the lowest approval ratings ever seen in
[55:48.880 --> 55:52.200]  history for the congress or for a president this far into their
[55:52.200 --> 55:57.200]  administration and he's losing percentage points every week and those are
[55:57.200 --> 56:01.680]  even cooked polls the numbers we're seeing show it's even worse liberals have
[56:01.680 --> 56:04.320]  woken up the fact that it's not free health care that it cuts their
[56:04.320 --> 56:08.720]  medicare and medicaid and doesn't cover pre-existing conditions they're very
[56:08.720 --> 56:16.240]  upset conservatives are extremely upset and are aware of what's going on and so
[56:16.240 --> 56:19.360]  they're going to stage terror attacks they're going to stage riots they're
[56:19.360 --> 56:23.520]  going to stage all sorts of events to make anyone who's pro-second amendment
[56:23.520 --> 56:27.160]  or pro-national sovereignty bad that's what happened with the hatari militia all
[56:27.160 --> 56:30.600]  beginning into that later no doubt now they did nothing wrong or completely
[56:30.600 --> 56:35.600]  set up from inside that's now admitted but they're going to turn loose the
[56:35.600 --> 56:39.960]  foundation thugs in police state to the takeover I have their own local
[56:39.960 --> 56:45.960]  footage admitting they were trained at foundation facilities in Oregon they've
[56:45.960 --> 56:52.560]  been shipped all over the world they show up and turn over trash cans light
[56:52.560 --> 56:58.920]  fires knockout windows so that summer police summer foundation operatives
[56:58.920 --> 57:04.040]  others are useful idiots that are brought in by them then later set up as a
[57:04.040 --> 57:09.040]  pretext for the riot police to attack the peaceful demonstrators and set the
[57:09.040 --> 57:12.840]  precedent for no demonstrations being allowed in the united states they are
[57:12.840 --> 57:19.920]  now going to be turned loose on the tea parties this is a red alert a red alert

[57:34.720 --> 57:39.120]  with some of the philosophy of extreme libertarianism and the smallest state

[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:16.240]  we posted this yesterday it's from C-Span and no it's not a April Fools joke
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:22.680]  here on April 2nd Georgian Democrat congressman Hank Johnson said during an
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:27.800]  armed services committee hearing last week that Guam is in danger my fear the
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.200]  whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:37.440]  capsize he said in all seriousness we don't anticipate that responded Admiral
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.800]  Robert Willard for some reason he did not burst out laughing but you can see
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:48.480]  he was shocked a little bit he went on to talk about climate change so it's not
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.680]  just that we have evil people in government we have ignorant people who
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.560]  really believe that of the ice caps melt which they're not melting they're
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.760]  getting bigger the last three years the earth's been cooling for at least 10 the
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.680]  warming trend reversed 15 years ago that's now admitted by the IPCC they've
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.440]  gone from denying that and saying you can't question the science to saying
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:15.160]  okay it's true but anybody knows that and they've done the cubic trillion ton
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:21.560]  calculations that if you take a glass and pile it all the way high two or
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:28.600]  three inches above with ice that ice displaces more volume than water frozen
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:37.280]  water ice displaces more volume than water this is well known and that if you
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.560]  have melting to a certain point at a certain point then it actually reverses
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:49.800]  because there's such a larger volume in the glaciers but that even upwards of
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:55.600]  half of the Arctic and Antarctic melting would cause water levels to go down
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:03.880]  because only the tip as the old cliche goes of the iceberg is visible you get
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:09.600]  over 95 or even higher depending on the volume of the ice of the iceberg is
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.680]  under the water just like an ice cube only the edge of the ice cube and your
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.720]  glass of water or your glass of orange juice or whatever you've got ice in your
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:27.080]  iced tea only the very edge of the ice floats and so if you have massive
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:33.320]  melting to a point after a certain point it does make water levels go up it it
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.080]  will actually displace less volume with all that ice in the ocean and those
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.960]  big ice caps jutting out into the ocean and all the life that's going on in the
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.960]  ocean underneath the ice caps if it melts you have the water levels go down
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:52.160]  and we have all the global measurements that we've shown here on air from
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:58.120]  ports in Europe in the United States in Asia and overall water levels in the
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:03.880]  last hundred and fifty years have gone down on average by about a foot a little
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:11.240]  over a foot so water levels have gone down ladies and gentlemen massively now
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:16.280]  the news media will show a beach a roading say in South Texas Mustang
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:21.320]  Island and say oh my gosh global warming no those intercoastal islands are
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:27.000]  always being destroyed and being built up they're being built up they're being
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.800]  destroyed it's random and it deals with the moon and the tidal forces that it
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:38.560]  exerts what causes the wind what causes the waves what causes most of the
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.880]  activity in the ocean the moon then it's the sun and I've had top climatologist
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:50.000]  on covering this it is a fact that the moon drives the tidal forces of the
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.800]  earth the moon the moon that big rock up in the sky at night was it was full a
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.520]  few days ago and I'm not being sarcastic there when I explain to people the moon
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.880]  is causing it I know we have new listeners here a lot of new listeners
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.080]  and they really believe everybody's gonna die they really believe the earth is
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.840]  heating they really believe carbon dioxide is a deadly poison they are
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:21.480]  people like Georgia congressman Hank Johnson talking to the admiral and he
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:27.200]  doesn't understand he thinks islands are floating on the ocean he doesn't know
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.360]  that they're the tips of mountains and hills he doesn't know they go down to the
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.480]  bottom of the ocean that many islands are volcanoes that come up out of the
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:41.720]  water like the Hawaiian island chain or many areas in Iceland Iceland's been
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:45.800]  having big eruptions that the the main island of Iceland is getting bigger
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.800]  right now it's not floating it's not like a inner tube or a raft when you float
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:58.000]  down the river it's big mountains mountains tectonic forces can drive up
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.600]  mountains and form new islands there can be earthquakes and islands can go
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:07.480]  underwater you can have something like Krakatoa that destroys much of an island
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:12.520]  you can have things like Pompeii in Italy and global warming didn't cause
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.920]  that you've got Danny Glover and the UN saying Haiti was caused by global
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.760]  warming has nothing to do with it and look I know my mainline listeners are
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.320]  laughing this is not a joke there are a lot of people that believe islands float
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:32.080]  and he believes this congressman who's for global warming and for the carbon
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:37.600]  tax he's not an evil person obviously he's a moron he's public school
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.640]  educated and he believes that if too many people he starts talking about how a
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.760]  city is on one side of the island too many people get on that side of the
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.600]  island and the island will flip over like a sailboat if you get too many
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:54.360]  people on one side of a sailboat it can capsize I was fishing a few weeks ago
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:59.000]  and saw a catamaran capsize my kids thought that was pretty interesting but
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.840]  that was a sailboat is not the island of Guam so I wanted to play this clip you
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.320]  want to see the video from sea span it's up on info wars.com here it is
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:13.080]  ladies and gentlemen the island of Guam will capsize from overpopulation the
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:21.600]  people will make the island flip over here it is. This is an island that at its
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:31.280]  widest level is what 12 miles from shore to shore and at its smallest level or
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:45.920]  smallest location it's seven miles between one shore and the other. Is that correct?
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:52.080]  I don't have the exact dimensions but to your point sir I think Guam is a small
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:15:01.080]  island. Very small island and about 24 miles if I recall long so 24 miles long
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:09.280]  about seven miles wide at the least widest place on the island and about
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:22.560]  12 miles wide on the widest part of the island and I don't know how many square
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:28.760]  miles that that is do you happen to know? I don't have that figure with me sir I
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:35.320]  can certainly supply it to you if you'd like. My fear is that the whole island
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:47.920]  will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize. We don't
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:54.680]  anticipate that the Guam population I think currently about 175,000 and
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.200]  again with 8,000 Marines and their families it's an addition of about 25,000
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:11.880]  more into the population and also things like the environment the sensitive
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:18.560]  areas of the environment coral reefs and those kinds of things and I know that you
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:24.000]  know lots of people don't like to think about that but you don't think about
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.480]  global warming either and now we do have to think about it and so I'm concerned
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:37.280]  from an environmental standpoint whether or not Guam is the best place to do
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.920]  this relocation but it's actually the only place is that correct? This is the
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:49.440]  best place this is the farthest west US territory that we own and you know this
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:59.640]  is part of our nation. Representative Hank Johnson is real he is
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:05.120]  George's fourth congressional district this was from C-SPAN last week and of
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.480]  course he believes global warming is real of course he thinks and he believes
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.320]  that the island of Guam is floating in the Pacific Ocean and that it's going to
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.840]  tumble over if too many Marines are based there that because he sees the
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.240]  base on one side of the island and he knows a boat will tumble over if too
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.200]  many people get on the side of a boat and so he's worried that that that this
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.800]  is going to then tumble over and that's the type of people we're arguing with
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.920]  when I talk to the general public you think he's uniquely ignorant uniquely
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.360]  stupid no he's par for the course I talked to adults that don't even really
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.240]  understand we're a planet that don't even I'm not joking who don't even
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:50.840]  understand we're orbiting a Sun who don't understand see the government is
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.720]  pitching everything at these type of individuals that's why they're moving
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:03.320]  ahead with tyranny because you've got people that literally have the mental
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:08.440]  capacity of about a six-year-old and it's the frequency pollution the bad food
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.560]  the lack of education all the television watching it's the being dumbed down it's
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.840]  the mercury in the shots it's the fluoride in the water it's the GMO
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.960]  crumbs we've gone from one and twenty something thousand twenty years ago with
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.720]  autism now it's one and sixty-eight the news has one and a hundred and five
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.040]  there's just people that are mentally retarded everywhere I talked to business
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.960]  people I talked to well-to-do yuppies they're complete idiots it's it but
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.320]  they know all about their local football team they get that right and their heads
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:45.720]  are so full of just mindless baloney that they believe that the countries are
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:53.520]  going to capsize if there's too many people they believe that man is causing
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:59.160]  earthquakes they believe that if we and maybe representative Hank Johnson can
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.960]  come up with a tax to stop maybe if we pay him a tax or Al Gorson money maybe
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:09.280]  that will cause islands from capsizing what do you think guys maybe if we shut
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.640]  down a few factories put some more taxes on you maybe they'll save us then
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.680]  because hey the science is settled according to representative Hank Johnson
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:24.840]  that islands float these rock islands are floating on top of the water I guess
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.600]  he thinks there's an anchor underneath the island that keeps it from blowing
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:32.360]  around maybe you could put a sail up on islands a big sail and then kind of
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:37.040]  cruise them around like a big cruise ship you just go out to an island put up
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:43.440]  put a big sail up and just start sailing around you know hey Hank well
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:49.920]  congressman why aren't those islands moving around because they're you know
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.400]  they're they're floating on top the water and now on a conspiracy theorist
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:00.640]  okay the science is settled the island will capsize I'm wrong I apologize

[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.360]  hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.080]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.680]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:14.720]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.480]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.520]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.400]  through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.600]  followed by a depressed economy a current effort is underway by the Fed along
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.400]  with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however an
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.040]  increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.840]  inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I recommend a
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:46.240]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:50.960]  silver while paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own

[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:30.080]  we are islands in a stream islands have their own boat buoyancy his name is
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:34.160]  Hank Johnson he's considered the pride of Georgia and a renowned expert on
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:43.160]  island buoyancy look Dolly Parton says the science is settled islands are
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:50.120]  floating the IPCC the UN congressman Johnson they've put it on record that
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.920]  islands are floating and people are a danger and may make them jump over into
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.560]  the ocean and then all those children would die but don't worry you send a
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:04.160]  big check to Al Gore let him run your life and he will give you island cap size
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:11.360]  insurance it's very inexpensive it's only about 20% of our GDP and if we again
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:16.080]  this is the type of morons that believe man make a little warming and believe
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:22.200]  carbon dioxide's a deadly poison but don't worry Obama to crush economy with
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:29.240]  massive CO2 tax as early as next week massive cuts in CO2 emissions but only
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:33.960]  for the United States and Europe everything will then move to China and
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:38.120]  Mexico and India but that's okay California's last auto plant shuts its
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:43.080]  doors the last car is rolled off the production lines the last auto plant in
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.640]  California and others are shutting down and don't worry carbon taxes will make
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.080]  the few other factories we've gotten places like San Antonio Texas moved to
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:58.480]  China or there will be no carbon taxes hip hip hooray good job they're saving us
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.000]  that way the North American continent after all it is an island the earth is
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.160]  76% covered with water I think did you know that what is it more than 70% of
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.280]  the US population lives on our coastlines in Florida and the east coast and in
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.960]  Texas and on the west coast that could cause the continent to to capsize or
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.640]  maybe break off in two because all the weight is on the edges of the country
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.720]  maybe it's gonna break maybe that's what the Mississippi River is maybe the
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.240]  Mississippi River was formed in the middle of the country because everybody
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.440]  lives on the edges of the country and maybe the country starting to break break
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:40.800]  in two and it'll capsize in two like a sailboat breaking oh oh Al Gorel come on
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:47.080]  TV pay me more taxes fast the the country's gonna capsize I'm gonna save
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:52.200]  you you know the issue here is this is not a joke this is what they're really
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:57.400]  doing in fact you it can you guys cue it back up on short notice to the to the
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.240]  middle it was in the middle that he got into the capsizing because he's you know
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.280]  he's saying hey this is a thin long island and our base is over there on the
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.400]  side and the Admiral says well sir 8,000 Marines I don't know if they'll make it
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.240]  turn capsize he doesn't even deny it fact if they say the science is settled
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:18.560]  then we'll have to start dispersing our populations on islands in a geographic
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:22.720]  way we'll have to be GPS tracked and microchipped to make sure that we're only
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.080]  allowed to go to certain areas of islands at certain times or it could
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:30.480]  top over and of course CNN's not talking about this nobody's talking about this
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:34.120]  because maybe it's the new science maybe it's true maybe I'm a conspiracy
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.600]  theorist maybe it's wrong than islands are made out of rock and sand and are
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.400]  part of the seafloor jutting up through the top of the ocean maybe I'm wrong
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:46.600]  maybe maybe maybe representative Hank Johnson George's fourth congressional
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.040]  district maybe he's right here he is I have that figure with me sir I can
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:57.280]  certainly supply it to you if you'd like yeah my fear is that the whole island
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:09.840]  will become so overly populated that it will tip over and and capsize we don't
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:15.360]  anticipate that the the Guam population I think currently about a hundred and
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.040]  seventy five thousand and again with 8,000 Marines in the back it up again I
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:23.200]  gotta hear that about because it's the way the admiral goes he kind of smiles
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:31.000]  him and looks and says sir we're not not anticipating that but it's just as
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.480]  laughable that carbon dioxide's a deadly nerve gas but they teach kids that
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.240]  everywhere here it is I can certainly supply it to you if you'd like my fear
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:29:08.200]  is that it's even funnier when you actually watch the video and the admiral
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:12.880]  trying to not bust out laughing but it's the same thing with carbon dioxide
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.360]  everything else we just let these people sit here and tell us this of course
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:23.760]  Al Gore and David Rothschild and Bill Gates all pushing this they know full
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.600]  well when they get up before school kids and show them graphics of carbon
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.200]  oxide now we've got to cut the human population to reduce it they picked a
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:36.440]  gas that we exhale that plants used to respirate use for photosynthesis they
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.920]  picked it because it's part of the life cycle one of the four life-giving
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.360]  elements water light carbon dioxide oxygen they picked it because they get
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.760]  the tax and run everything and they got a bunch of idiots that think islands cap
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:55.760]  size we're gonna go for it we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.920]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about reform even gold
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:16.960]  and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:21.080]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect

[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:13.080]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the GCN radio network
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:19.520]  okay I mentioned this in the last hour I'm gonna read the article written by
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.600]  Paul Joseph Watson coming up here in a few minutes it is so important beds
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.800]  prepare to use anarchist to provoke tea party violence and this ties into the
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.600]  government setting up malicious to create the perception there's this
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:37.160]  danger from gun owning Americans we have the false flag of a week and a half
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:40.520]  ago now confirmed from multiple angles no one said the n-word to the
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:44.320]  congressman walking through the tea parties in front of the Capitol on the
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:48.280]  day it passed no one said we're gonna kill you they said kill the bill no one
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:53.360]  spit in their faces that was a false flag this is going to be their strategy
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:57.920]  to turn this around on us because the healthcare takeover is so unpopular the
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.360]  greenhouse gas taxes are so unpopular this whole agenda is so unpopular
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:08.000]  right now so that is coming up but I want to premiere here for radio listeners
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.760]  and prison planet dot TV viewers we're now simulcasting the last two and a half
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.760]  hours at prison planet dot TV as we do every day some days even more I want to

[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:26.120]  order defined then the next piece is a longer trailer because it's not only a
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:31.880]  new police state trailer it begins with a sneak peek just of three minutes from
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:37.400]  the two-hour 20-plus minute film police state for the rise of FEMA where the
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:42.600]  feds and the military were trying to set up my cameraman as terrorists that
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.440]  wanted to attack the military base and they did this to a lady in upstate
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:49.520]  New York who just went and photographed a base because she was concerned about
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:55.840]  FEMA camps this is what they do so that is coming up as well now both these
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:01.400]  trailers are going up at info wars calm and prison planet calm in the next hour
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:04.880]  they're not on YouTube yet they're not on the Alex Jones channel yet they're
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:08.440]  not posted on info wars in prison planet yet but when you're listening to this as
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.920]  a rebroadcast on stations across the country or XM coming up on Saturday and
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:18.160]  Sunday they will be both be up at info wars calm and prison planet calm you

[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:26.960]  been manufactured will be shipping out on April 15th and of course the first
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:32.800]  film will premiere April 15th invisible Empire a new order defined over two
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.240]  hours jam-packed the history of the new order who they are how they run their
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:40.160]  operations and then on the 21st we're going to premiere police state for the
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.360]  rise of FEMA at prison planet TV but now is your chance to order the highest
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:49.960]  quality DVDs and that also supports this radio broadcast let's go to trailer
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:54.960]  number three for Invisible Empire
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:09.880]  Adolf Hitler he wanted the world government with himself as the master
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:16.760]  leisure one small central authority of the individuals can then dictate a
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.320]  policy that's going to be distributed down to the rest of the world everywhere
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:26.760]  invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the world's superclass this
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:30.840]  documentary chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:35.800]  centuries to establish an oppressive world government we've become accustomed
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:41.040]  to the idea that every now and then something is going to happen and we just
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:46.320]  know from the beginning we're not going to get to the bottom of it learn how this
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:50.160]  global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking money
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.320]  laundering staged terror attacks media propaganda intent Americans are easily
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:00.080]  motivated by false flag operations and I think it's inevitable that we will see
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.640]  false flag operations in the near future witness their plan for a global tax and
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:08.520]  a cashless surveillance society in which every man woman and child is
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:12.600]  microchipped at birth a network Washington set up to run arms to the
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:16.760]  country's wound up running cocaine for the most vicious drug cartel in the
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:24.800]  world Barney Frank acknowledged having used a male prostitute whom he then
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.080]  hired as a personal employee and he ran a prostitution business out of Frank's
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.720]  home if you look at the elite throughout history many of the people that
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:38.120]  achieve pinnacles of power are into the occult stories about what happens in
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:41.400]  these redwoods are hard to come by

[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.880]  just indescribable as well I set out to make a film a year ago about fema camps
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.280]  but I thought they were making camp fema so I waited to consult on that and be
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:28.440]  part of it and it's excellent we sell it but this gets into COG executive orders
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.800]  fema camps the governor's council the john warren defense authorization act
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:39.920]  the riot police the g-20 false flag terror the underwear bomber it's got
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:49.560]  tarpoli myself just many others it's got salenta in it again so jam packed and
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.000]  it's done in an updated style but the same as my original police state films
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:59.400]  it's powerful so police state for the rise of fema now this intros with a
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:05.240]  sneak peek from a section where they tried to frame my camera crew in
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:10.640]  Pittsburgh as trying to attack the base and then running off and then the
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:13.840]  police tried to frame him as terrorist and I had to get on the telephone and
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:17.080]  let him know that we had financial backing and that we would protect our
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.920]  people do still got arrested I had to spend thousands in court to defeat
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:26.640]  that fraud I mean this this is an important film for anybody that's
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:29.840]  questioning whether fema camps are real and who want to understand this police
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:35.040]  state surveillance grid takeover here it is a trailer to extended sneak peek
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:56.000]  from police state for the rise of fema

[01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:00.480]  Rush Limbaugh said repeatedly last week I agree with him on this but the point is
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.840]  even mainstream is saying this now mainstream conservatives that there's
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:08.920]  no way politically without staging terror or without having a big crisis that
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:12.520]  they can get away with this in the upcoming elections that they will stage
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:18.160]  crises Michael Savage is saying it so the point is anyone who has a political
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:22.320]  brain and he's been around knows this is happening there's open talk about

[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:17.960]  thug given the past history of how so-called anarchist groups are so
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:21.400]  easily infiltrated and provocatured by the authorities to commit meaningless
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:25.080]  acts of violence that only served as credit political causes we should be
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.360]  alarmed by the possibility that anarchist plans to quote crash the tea
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:33.040]  parties will present the perfect opportunity for the establishment to
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:37.320]  create a flashpoint with which to demonize constitutionalist and

[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:29.080]  people were behind me screaming it so there's dirty tricks on both sides but

[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.000]  but when you really meet these anarchists they're always wearing red stars
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.840]  on april 15th thousands of right wingers will attend rallies in cities and
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:53.880]  towns across the united states the organizers of these
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:57.800]  nationwide day of protest call it a tea party this tea party movement
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:02.280]  that emerged only a year ago is a coalition of conservatives anti-semites fascist
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:06.920]  libertarians racist constitutionalist militiamen gunfreaks homophobes
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:11.160]  ron paul supporters and alex jones conspiracy types and american flag
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.400]  waivers and you don't want to waive that american flag
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.400]  so i'm i'm lumped in with those evil flag waivers in one paragraph the so-called
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:20.360]  anarchists have regurgitated wholesale the exact rhetoric
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:23.080]  that the corporate-owned media their supposed adversaries
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:27.480]  have been spewing ceaselessly for months on end that anyone
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:32.360]  who opposes big government which is what anarchists are supposed to do
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.840]  is a racist and a extremist
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.960]  while also lying about the origins of the tea party which is in fact started by
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:46.600]  ron paul supporters as early as 2007 the anarchist primary reason
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:50.120]  for wanting to crash tea party demonstrations because is the tea party
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:53.640]  movement takes over the country they will really hurt
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:57.000]  poor people by getting rid of social programs like food stamps unemployment
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.280]  benefits disability benefits student aid free health care act
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.200]  quote is completely at odds with the traditional anarchist political doctrine
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:08.760]  of extremely limited or no government whatsoever yeah most of these attack
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:13.000]  groups that call themselves anarchists are communists i mean i've been there
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.360]  i've seen them wearing red stars and talking about malice tongue
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:19.240]  and how great he is
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:23.560]  the article continues here as curtain emmo points out these people are not
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:27.400]  anarchist at all they are leftist teenage socialist punks
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:31.000]  who like to call themselves workers but a good portion of whom have probably
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.960]  never worked a day in their life they make for perfect puppets through which
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:37.800]  the establishment can manipulate to demonize its real political adversaries
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:41.320]  and then they link to all the news articles for page after page
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:44.840]  denver post toronto star all the articles
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:48.280]  where mainstream news admits the police stage these groups
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.680]  and stage these events 110 percent they've been caught
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:58.680]  over and over and over and over again all over this nation all over the world
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:04.680]  all over other countries and that's just the first part
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:08.680]  of the article i'm going to come back and cover some more
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:14.120]  of it but as we have constantly warned the latter half of april
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:17.400]  represents the most dangerous time period for when we can expect violence to be
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:21.000]  staged provocateur which will instantly be blamed on tea
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.120]  partyers libertarians and constitutionalists a brief history of how
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:27.400]  anarchist groups have been infiltrated and steered by authorities
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:30.760]  to commit mayhem and violence in order to justify a crackdown
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.000]  of free speech and the right to assemble has never been
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.320]  more prescient than we have the links feds prepare to use anarchists to provoke
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:42.840]  tea party violence we have another link here at the g20
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:46.280]  summit where they got caught doing it we have links all over the world the
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:52.120]  1999 wto the 2008 situation in canada we have
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:56.520]  links to all of this in the article we also show how
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:58:00.280]  hired thugs that work for obama all over the country are beating up tea party
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:04.760]  people and the news spins it and says the tea party people are attacking them
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:08.200]  just like a week and a half ago when the democratic congressman walked through
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:11.880]  and claimed that the n word was yell they were spit at
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:15.880]  people said they were going to kill them the closest thing to truth there is
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:18.840]  kill the bill kill the bill no spitting no n word
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:22.040]  that video is all out there of the actual incident they claim people were
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:24.200]  arrested for doing it they were not arrested

[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:39.880]  preparing to take private and public pension funds to give it to the private
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.560]  banks that is bloomberg the latest developments there but
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:46.520]  bob shatman of course has been run out of the united states for exposing these
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:49.480]  people shot at you name it he helped publish the book gary
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:51.640]  allen they put out over five million copies

[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:04.760]  them on today because i learned of this this morning
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:07.560]  i knew because it was in the ap and other publications
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:11.000]  uh a month or so ago that he got set up by williamson county he's a former
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.120]  narcotics officer who does stings exposing government
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:17.400]  violations the fourth amendment cops stealing drugs

[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:31.560]  report saying they took him because quote
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:35.480]  parents are unsuitable and create an environment where the children believe
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:39.160]  the government is out to harm them so the headline
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:44.760]  up at info wars dot com cops and cpsc's child from parents
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:48.200]  for mistrusting government prison planet dot com

[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:53.400]  these folks then we'll get into all the other issues
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:57.000]  but bob uh you were just telling me about another case of this with canada
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.240]  and the us i mean this is this is bad where we're now into these rules of
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:06.040]  war against the people they take your children for your political beliefs
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:10.280]  well this family was in new brunswick and in abut's uh aristok county
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:14.280]  that's how it's pronounced incidentally in main and uh
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:18.680]  they had bought a farm in new brunswick and the former homeless that farm had
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:21.800]  moved down the way and they wanted to get out and see them
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:24.840]  so they went down the road and there were a couple of signs but they thought
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:28.920]  they took the right road they didn't and they were immediately pulled over by
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:32.920]  border patrol and they told him that uh they said to you
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:36.520]  canadians and they said yeah they said you're under arrest stuck them in
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.840]  now this is a dog and two little girls
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:44.200]  and a man and i think his wife was there too
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:48.440]  and uh they think of rent to them and and uh charge them
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.160]  but they said they were going to let them go to it so they could return to
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:55.480]  canada now what are these people thinking about
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:59.240]  i'm talking about border patrol
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:05.880]  i just don't get it well bob we're going to discuss this case coming up in the
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:08.360]  next segment and get your take on it and then
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:11.640]  about 30 40 minutes into the interview our guests will leave us but this was an
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:15.080]  emergency situation then we'll get into the economy and other issues
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:18.840]  uh what do you think about the fed run anarchist announcing
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:23.400]  uh that they are going to go disrupt we know how they disrupt attacking people
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:27.320]  breaking things at tea parties nationwide how does that fit into my
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:30.680]  prediction that they're going to start staging events into the month
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:35.960]  of april now this uh provocateur action with a hatari militia this doesn't look
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:39.960]  good now it's going to continue to degenerate
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:43.480]  and and the reason it is taking the form that it's taking
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:48.360]  is it being forced to and you use our perfect example of that last
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:54.120]  friday uh when we talked about and then you did uh some further work on the fact
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:59.080]  that's uh cnn wanted to interview you they don't know what to do
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:03.240]  they're trying to stop us and they can't and so they're they're they're
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.960]  branching out they're trying to be disruptive everywhere that they can
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:11.400]  in order to keep us off balance so that's not going to
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:15.320]  because we're telling the truth and we're not breaking the law
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:18.760]  and we want everybody to know what their rights are and
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:22.760]  we want everybody to know what's going on out there what the government is
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:24.840]  doing
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:29.640]  well we're going to cover all of that uh coming up there's also some good news
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:34.040]  federal judge finds nsa wiretaps were illegal
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.640]  and so we'll be breaking that down uh but coming up police
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:40.600]  say teaching kids to mistrust government makes a couple
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:45.240]  unsuitable parents that's from truce slant uh we also have our article on
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.880]  this that's a more detailed cops and cpsc's
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:51.400]  challenge for parents for mistrusting government you're not allowed to teach
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:54.440]  children uh to not trust the state
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:58.520]  i guess uh thomas jepperson would have had his family taken away
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:01.480]  because of his common sense well they're right but
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:04.440]  hello this is alex jones with some important questions

[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:25.080]  because of this well our first thing in odessa where we stung the cops
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:29.640]  resulted in a lady getting released from federal prison
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:33.560]  about two months ago and coming off the success of that we went into williamson
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:36.920]  county because of all the complaints and i actually live in travis county i took
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:39.800]  your advice alex okay so i was confused so they
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:42.600]  they got you out of the jury i mean they they waited to get you in their
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:46.600]  jurisdiction well what they did uh they uh my daughter
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:50.280]  and i were headed to the university to give a speech and they got travis
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:53.800]  county narcotics along with williamson county narcotics
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:57.320]  to arrest me and took us to our house so they knew you were going to a speech
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:00.200]  they were waiting go ahead yeah they were waiting and uh i was in
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.960]  handcuffs and my daughter was out in the driveway and they forced us
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:07.880]  to watch a felony raid on our home with no way to uh
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:11.720]  to warn candy and it was because we had went into williamson county and did a
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:16.920]  sting i caught a cop there stealing drug money i put the free video up on our
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:20.760]  website nevergetbusted.com it's 45 minutes and five days
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:25.080]  later they raided us well so you did take my advice
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:27.800]  because i was worried about you you were saying i may move up there and may run
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:29.960]  stings and i said well you've got a lot of courage
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:33.080]  but i knew they were going to do this to you i mean i've never seen anybody
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:37.800]  as as dangerous as williamson county well uh you know
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:42.760]  alex it is a police state i had no idea because we had our lawyers looking all
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:46.520]  over all the sting material and they said i was safe as far as not breaking
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:50.280]  any laws but two days in solitary confinement away from
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:54.120]  my family they actually wouldn't even book me in jail for over
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:57.880]  15 hours they kept me hidden and our lawyers and stuff would call and they
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:02.840]  said no he's not in this jail they had me in solitary confinement the whole time
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:06.760]  uh searching our home they did that for four hours and took all of our media
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:10.840]  all of our computers all of my tapes that we had worked so hard
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:16.200]  in three years on and then it resulted in a big cps investigation where they
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:19.880]  made comments that they were concerned with our daughter's safety because she
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:24.120]  had sudden outburst of crying for no reason during the raid
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:27.800]  well that's crazy of course she's crying yeah that's in here too
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:32.040]  so so they rage you they cry and they usually try to put kids on prozac if they
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.680]  cry oh we took you from your parents you're crying
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:38.920]  we're going to put you on deadly drugs incredible well they even go on in that
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:44.120]  report to say that uh we give our kids drugs which is nuts there's no proof
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:46.840]  for evidence of that we don't give our kids drugs
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:49.960]  what happened is since we got the girl out of prison and we busted the
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:53.320]  Williamson county uh deputy they realized we were no
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:57.240]  longer a nuisance and became a serious threat and we're filling the full
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:00.600]  force of the government on our family right and you were a former
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:03.720]  highly decorated narcotics officer who refused to go along
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:06.680]  with all the frame-ups just like dr. frederick weir as former head of the
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:10.680]  fbi crime lab we had on two days ago just saying it's totally criminal
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:14.200]  i mean it's it's it it is operating procedure
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:19.080]  to frame people now uh please continue with the cps
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:23.080]  situation okay they raided us on a misdemeanor for one false report to a
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:26.120]  peace officer and in the affidavit it even says an
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:29.480]  unidentified caller called in the suspicious bag
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:32.760]  which had the drug money that i'd planted in it
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:36.280]  but the truth is in that affidavit they said they heard my voice in the
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:39.880]  background so they raided us on a misdemeanor which
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:43.480]  never happens and uh we had a fight for our lives and
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:47.480]  right now our eight-year-old son named zach johnson
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:53.240]  is uh is in east texas now in a in a bad place a bad situation he's got
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:58.600]  cerebral palsy he's almost deaf um he's on a four-year-old level and
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:01.960]  we've never been away from him his entire life now let's be clear who's
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:06.200]  whose son is he biologically mine yes and and he's he's almost his entire
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:10.680]  life he's been with uh you guys and but thank god he's not just in cps hands
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:14.840]  though at least he is with his father yes which i don't know which is worse
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:19.000]  which we kind of think we'd rather be in cps his hand as bad as that sounds
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.920]  because now we're going into east texas courts and in that affidavit
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:26.520]  they're bringing up statements that berry and candy are nationally
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:32.280]  recognized marijuana advocates berry and candy appear on fox news all
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:37.880]  the time and they make claims such as everything the the government our
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:42.520]  teachers our churches and our parents taught us about narcotics was wrong
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:46.360]  which that's true so they're accusing us of all these things that are true it's
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:51.240]  our politic marijuana is listed as a narcotic it is by them in fact it
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:56.360]  so so all of this is going on and in the report they took the children
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:16:03.080]  they they they took your son because how did they learn supposedly that you
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:05.480]  were saying bad things about the government and how was it their right
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:09.640]  to take a child now because parents say don't trust the government
[02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:13.880]  it was it was my ex-husband which we've been friends with this whole time
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:17.720]  for three years he knew what we did he's been at our house
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:21.720]  you know we were all friends he he found out through
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.720]  i guess a lawyer that we sued for ten million dollars on a false raid three
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:29.880]  years ago williamson county narcotics unit called that lawyer and said we've
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:32.680]  got berry cooper now so that lawyer got with
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:38.920]  the the real father of zack and it's it really is a conspiracy and
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:43.480]  and retaliation on it they filed a uh restraining order
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:48.360]  on me and berry and um about three weeks ago and we're all
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:51.960]  terrifying we're all a really close family our 16 year old daughter finished
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:55.320]  her first year of college at acc last year
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:59.960]  she's in her second year this year we're a very loving close family
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:03.880]  and of course we teach that the government is out to get us they're the
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:07.000]  ones who came into the house and pointed guns at my kids and
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.720]  put me in jail for something that i didn't do it's all for busting that cop
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:15.640]  and he's a captain at liberty hill police department that we'd been getting
[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:20.520]  complaints on and we set a trap for him and we stung him and there was a hbo
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:25.000]  film crew there when we confronted the chief of police with the video evidence
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.640]  and five days later they were raiding our house and that raid in jail was
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:34.920]  nothing alex compared to losing our son well this sets a precedent now i mean
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:37.720]  the police say you're criticizing the government we're
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:41.080]  going to take your child i want to go to bob Chapman bob
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:45.240]  this is classic terrorism in the rules of war and this is even war this is
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:48.200]  political you don't go after children and women
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:52.760]  uh... that has always been the rule because armies and systems don't want
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:56.280]  their forces going after their families that's prasada non grata
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:00.440]  as a veteran as military intelligence as a patriot bob does this make your
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:02.920]  blood boil to hear this case
[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:07.320]  so it certainly does it shows how out of control not only the federal government
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:11.560]  is but other forms of government in law enforcement
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:17.560]  and you know you say to yourself when is it all and uh... were the good people
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:21.960]  i mean what what uh... well how do these things happen and they are happening
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:26.360]  uh... this is uh... uh... a true story we're listening to here
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:29.000]  you know i have the report they say they took
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.840]  the child and it's just trying to get the others because these people
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:36.120]  say teach their kids to not trust the government
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:39.400]  i mean that's as american as apple pie bob
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.000]  it certainly is and uh...
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.280]  so uh... what course have you taken
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:52.680]  uh... with the with the boy and getting him released uh... what does that stand
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:55.720]  that's a good question what course are you taking to get your son back
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:59.160]  we we are fighting actually we're we're in east texas we're
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.400]  uh... fighting for change of venue so we can get it here try to get it to travis
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:07.240]  county we're having a drive to east texas and pay lawyers a lot of money by the
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:10.040]  way any donations would really help us because we are
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:14.840]  a family out here doing all of this and the government's got more money than we
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:17.640]  do but we're fighting it out in east texas courts
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:21.080]  which is really tough so we go back in two weeks
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:24.680]  and that two weeks feels like two years being away from our son but we go back
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:28.680]  in two weeks for a venue change and if we get that in the travis county courts
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:31.720]  here we'll be able to take over what venue is this in right now
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:37.080]  it's in uh... upshark county texas uh... bible belt two hundred forty churches
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.160]  in that one county and they do not like and they have no idea police are dealing
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:44.600]  drugs selling drugs using this to put their kids in prison
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:48.760]  they think it's of the lord and the cia don't bring it in
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:52.520]  that's and and you are of the devil that's exactly right and that's what
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:56.120]  we're fighting and what they're actually doing is allowing the devil to take over
[02:19:56.120 --> 02:20:02.200]  we'll be right back stay with us

[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:33.480]  that things he's witnessed doing this over the years i met him and found he
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:39.480]  was a fan and a listener uh when he took photos of myself for one of the
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:41.960]  cover stories for texas monthly last month
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:45.720]  uh so that should be interesting coming up and of course bob Chapman's riding
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:49.400]  shotgun with us uh you were just telling me
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:53.560]  that you guys have been threatened now and that
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:56.840]  i don't even want to make uh your ex-husband you know the bad guy here
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:59.800]  and i asked that you said no he's not really he's being threatened
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:04.200]  he's being pressured i guess the choice of cps or take your son
[02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:08.120]  uh but first let's get into the threats
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:12.360]  berry well uh we've received threats and
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:15.240]  attorneys of ours that know some people high up and
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:20.280]  we've gotten hundreds of phone calls people warning us and some other police
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.640]  officers that if we continue doing these cop stings
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:27.960]  the next step is they'll plant something on me and put me away for 20 years
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:32.840]  or or they'll uh they'll shoot me so uh like i said we're one family
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:37.080]  exposing corruption and the cost is very high i had no idea this would ever
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:39.160]  happen well you're also getting ready to run for political
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:42.280]  office that's another reason i want to bust you i'm actually running for texas
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:46.120]  attorney general and uh by the way one of the judges
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:49.480]  i'd also let it out that if i didn't win texas attorney general
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:53.080]  that i was going to run for judge in precinct five of austin
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:56.120]  it turns out it was that judge in precinct five
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:01.800]  that signed the search warrant to our home wow so this is the political boss
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:05.800]  hogs in these counties are going boy you don't expose the good business we got
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:09.400]  we got these questions around here fooled we're trying to stop everything
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:12.520]  they don't understand how it really works now you're gonna keep your mouth shut
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:15.320]  boy that's exactly right that was very good
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:19.640]  impression of what we're up against we run these counties we run these slaves
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:24.520]  around here yeah and the the jp that signed the arrest warrant for us
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:28.280]  it's her son that's the prosecutor on this case
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:32.600]  the sergeant that raided my house i used to be a hero of his when i was a
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:36.680]  narcotics officer teaching other officers through academy throughout
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:39.880]  academies in texas how to seize the narcotics that i was
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:43.400]  seizing and uh i was one of his heroes and since
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:46.360]  i switched side he's had a vendetta against us
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:50.040]  ever since so when we busted one of his friends stealing drug money
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:54.760]  that's when he came through our door with the guns drawn but again the key to
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:58.520]  all of this here is the police report confidential
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:02.360]  uh that that you guys got a hold of so we're allowed to release it here
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:06.360]  and it says the reason your son was taken please explain your current
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:09.720]  concerns regarding supervision of the child child children
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:13.880]  parents are unsuitable and create an environment
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:17.160]  where the children believe the government is out to harm them and alex
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:21.320]  there's another statement in there that says barry doesn't believe in church
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:25.880]  and hates his dad and wants his dad to die well it's true i don't believe in the
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:29.000]  church because of the harms they've brought on this country
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  and the reason i don't care if my father dies or not because he
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  he thinks i belong in jail he's one of those old white baptist
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.800]  christian males and he still thinks i should be separated from my family
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:45.080]  so i disowned him three years but the point is i mean they're taking your
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:48.280]  personal comments and things and criticizing hypocrisy
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:51.160]  as if that's why you have to have your children taken
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:54.040]  exactly and that's what we're having to fight so this is taking people's
[02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:58.440]  children for their political speech that's what's very dangerous president
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:01.480]  every parent is threatened i mean this is this is thought crime you're a thought
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:05.880]  criminal 1984 very serious very serious you know rosa
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:09.240]  parks had to stand up on a bus one day to get something changed
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:13.000]  and we stood up on a bus trying to prove that these cops
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:17.960]  actually do commit crimes and well the drugs are brought in to reinstate
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:21.480]  slavery they bring in addictive substances push the legal ones on the
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:24.840]  kids at the same time they're caught everywhere dealing them controlling them
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:27.800]  stealing the money and they're the ones that want to keep it illegal
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:30.280]  just like the drug dealers we've interviewed want to keep it illegal
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:33.160]  because they understand it's a black market that makes them all the money
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:37.000]  and they're hoping the public doesn't figure this out i i don't like drugs
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.160]  i don't like any of them i mean even coffee i can't get off of it
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:43.720]  but but the issue is you shouldn't go to prison for it
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:48.840]  exactly and and you know we caught a cop committing a felony stealing drug money
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:53.720]  and nothing's happened to him but we got raided and you had hbo with you that

[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:37.400]  to civil rights lawsuits i want to say something about
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:40.520]  williamson county and other rural counties that
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:44.360]  that butt up to big cities like austin and we're now a big city over a million
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:48.360]  people 20 years ago even 10 years ago it was mainly
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:51.960]  cow pasture and some good old boys and believe my family's been down here in
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:55.640]  this area of texas for a long time the corruption up there was known back
[02:33:55.640 --> 02:33:58.920]  then you get good old boys in charge they own the jail their family gets the
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:02.120]  contracts and it's come out with uh you know past
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:05.400]  mayor and police chiefs up in uh georgetown with just
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:08.440]  stuff you will just blow your mind what they're doing
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:14.440]  uh and i predict williamson county will end up going down in history it's one
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:17.480]  of the most corrupt counties because as it gets bigger and hundreds of thousands
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:21.240]  of people move in there and they feed on all these new people from california
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:25.400]  and stuff moving in who have no idea as they keep running this boss hog
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:28.840]  situation with hundreds of thousands of people under them uh they're going to be
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:32.520]  brought to justice and and more and more they are being brought to justice but
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:37.320]  williamson county leadership is a cancer in this country but the similar things
[02:34:37.320 --> 02:34:39.720]  are going on that they've had all these cnn specials about
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:42.520]  where the police just admit in small towns in texas they just pull you over
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:46.120]  take your money you were taught how to do that you were taught to plant drugs
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:50.680]  talking about your father who thinks you're bad because you're from marijuana
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:53.800]  legalization have you explained to him you were trained to plant drugs i mean
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:56.920]  does he think uh when you talk to him that that's morally
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:00.520]  okay or or does he just deny that's happening unfortunately like a lot of
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:04.040]  the older christians in this land their ears are stopped my father won't even
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:06.920]  look at the evidence he won't even talk to me about it
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:10.520]  but he's a military man and they taught him a certain way
[02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:13.960]  and by god that's not going to change and unfortunately
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:17.560]  that's the attitude a lot of it doesn't he know why we're having obama care and
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:21.400]  open borders and tyranny it's because we are run by crux they the
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:25.400]  these mainline good christian people need to stop living in denial
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:29.560]  well they're responsible for all the uh needless lives being locked up right
[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:33.880]  now they've made laws against morals the christians decided if they couldn't
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:38.200]  behave that way and everybody else was having fun dancing and drinking and
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:41.800]  doing and the cia narcotics drop traffickers in the 30s even before the
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:45.320]  cia was set up they lobbied to have all this done because they'd lost alcohol
[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:49.320]  prohibition well i actually uh got kilos of cracked cocaine off the
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:53.880]  street that came directly from the cia when i was a narcotics officer
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:57.400]  and i was told at the time that that's what it was and i didn't believe it
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:01.160]  because i was brainwashed too and later in years when those documents
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:04.440]  began to be revealed i realized i was seizing cocaine
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:08.760]  that was put here by our own government and putting uh nonviolent people in jail
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:12.760]  for that and i feel bad i feel really bad about that that's why i switched sides
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:16.280]  and produced these videos that teach how not to get busted for pot
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:19.880]  and then we started doing cop busters and that's cop busters with the k
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:22.680]  you got a lot of courage because i told you a year ago when you were in there i
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:25.400]  said buddy get ready they're coming down on you with both feet
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:29.240]  you did alex and um and they did and they did and we would and and and they
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:33.000]  will um i mean i'm just telling that they
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.760]  will try to kill you next i mean i mean you know that yes this is big
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:40.680]  business and you're not going to cut into that yes
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:43.560]  you know we've gotten uh did i already talk about the death threats and
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:46.280]  everything well i want to get bob chatman's
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:49.240]  final comments then shift into other areas and we'll monitor this as it
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:51.560]  unfolds but people should go to your site they
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:55.160]  should watch the videos research it for themselves and we should also pray for
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:59.880]  the evil hearts of police that that that think of us as nonhumans
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:02.680]  i mean i've had police over and over again trying to frame me for violence i
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:04.440]  have the national media doing it right now
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:07.880]  i've i've showed a clip earlier where the military is trying to frame my
[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:11.880]  my camera guys as terrorists oh you're definitely on the radar i'm surprised
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:15.960]  you haven't been raided i'm not sure how you've kept well they understand that
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:21.000]  we have extremely clean noses here and i have i've sued government before and
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.400]  others and so they realize that we're a big target and so
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:30.120]  uh but i'm sure it unfortunately is is in the works and i've been told
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:34.520]  but see i i'm not my dad always explained to me he said
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:37.400]  and then years after i kind of saw a similar thing at the end of carlitos
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:40.280]  way it's not the high level gangsters that kill
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:43.560]  carlito it's the low level thugs my dad when i first
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:46.360]  started getting into this he said listen i've studied a lot of history he said
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:49.800]  you can go after bill clinton you can go after big powerful politicians you can
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:53.560]  do that he said that when you go after boss hogs they will kill you
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:58.040]  because they boss hogs you can beat the big bankers pretty much don't care
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:01.320]  it's these boss hogs that are that are dangerous
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:04.520]  well see i thought the opposite we thought we were safe just setting
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:07.640]  stings up for local police because that's what the local people need now
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:10.760]  that's the most dangerous we realize that now
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:13.720]  the the i mean and let's just our son i mean if you're a cop trying to
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:16.680]  investigate oklahoma city being an inside job and they killed a bunch of cops up
[02:38:16.680 --> 02:38:21.960]  in oklahoma portrait them to death i mean they don't play games i mean
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:25.160]  this is a 500 billion dollar a year industry of narcotics trafficking and
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:28.600]  as long as the mainline christians are asleep and suck on their thumbs
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:32.760]  the scam can continue well fortunately you know hollywood's caught on and we
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:36.680]  signed a movie deal with yeah tell folks the positive news got an mpr special
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:41.160]  hbo tv tell folks yeah we signed a deal not too long ago with brett
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:45.560]  ratner the hollywood giant who did prison break and x-men and rush hours
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:49.720]  and they want to do a movie in the theaters about our lives
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:56.120]  and april eighth or ninth april ninth the mpr uh story will air about
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:58.920]  american life called this america that's one of their biggest shows
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:02.920]  right about four million but we were just as excited to be on your show
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:06.360]  alex thanks for reaching out to us because we are just a single family
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:09.960]  we're not a big organization we don't even have any full-time employees
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:13.880]  we've done all of this is just activists as a family on our own well that's the
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:17.960]  key we need more people to do what you've done until there's too many patriots
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:21.400]  standing up for them to stop us they they and that's one reason they haven't
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:25.000]  come after me physically yeah well they beat me up once and i get threats and
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.160]  threats on my family i mean a lot of stuff's happened
[02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:30.200]  is because we're an idea and ideas are bulletproof and we have
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:33.720]  gotten millions of people to take action and they know if they kill me
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:38.120]  it will just make everything i've done that much more evergreen
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:42.200]  exactly well still be careful out there because they got martin luther king and
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:46.680]  well i don't think i'm to that level so well you know he did some great things
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:50.520]  for his time and i'm so thankful he's one of my heroes
[02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:54.760]  but uh this is 2010 and you've certainly carried it to another level
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:59.160]  well guys give the website out again never get busted dot com please go
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:03.800]  there and help us out we've got a donate button there for our legal fees
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:08.040]  and uh i ask you about this the texas rangers and they won't investigate this
[02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:11.720]  texas rangers announced they won't investigate the liberty hill sting
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:15.880]  which is not a surprise to me because i have a private clip on youtube ready to
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:19.800]  roll where i actually filmed a phone conversation between me and them
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:24.040]  where they said this will just come to austin and kick your ass
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:27.720]  and i've got that on film they did that over the yolanda madden case
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:32.280]  where we stung the cops in odessa on a false raid that resulted in yolanda
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:36.040]  being released from prison after being there for four years
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:39.320]  she's out of prison now they're harry do you remember me telling you to make copies
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:42.280]  of all your stuff they didn't seize everything you had did they
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:46.440]  pretty all your videos pretty close but we've got some backup well you now got
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:50.920]  to put that that texas ranger clip out and i actually didn't keep uh
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:54.360]  keep our videos on site we always kept them somewhere else but i had them in
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:57.320]  the house because that hbo film crew needed them
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:00.840]  and i forgot to return them back to their hiding spots well there's no doubt
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:04.600]  they were listening to your phones possibly they're listening right now
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:08.360]  what do you want to say to them well i want to tell them how cruel and evil
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:12.840]  they are that this is cruelty uh like no other when you start
[02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:17.640]  touching people's families and i know you know you're not right
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:22.200]  uh stop it because we're not going to stop exposing corruption
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:25.880]  and uh how dare you come into my home on a misdemeanor
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:29.240]  pointing guns at my family if you were civilians and did that you would have
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:33.800]  been charged with home invasion burglary theft because you took all of our stuff
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:37.000]  and you did all that for a misdemeanor that i didn't even commit
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:40.520]  and that's why uh we've got a 40 million dollar lawsuit
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:45.080]  coming in your direction and we're gonna get our son back uh i'll die
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:51.080]  i'm a nonviolent but i will do everything in my power legally to get our son
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:41:54.760]  back so zach we're coming to get you baby right candy and by saying you'll die
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:57.800]  you're ready for him to kill you you're ready to go all the way
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:01.880]  well i'll use a real texas ranger quote from their founder
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:06.840]  a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man who's in the right and keeps
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:10.600]  on coming thank you guys good having you
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:14.360]  hey alex appreciate it yes sir thank all right guys we'll continue to watch
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.640]  this case with a berry and candy cooper pray for him folks
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:20.600]  okay going back to bob Chapman bob thank you for holding during that i'm going
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:23.160]  to give you the floor now in the economy the police state all the big
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:26.920]  developments but putting uh uh incaps on that
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:32.040]  uh bob Chapman uh what's your take on what you just heard
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:37.560]  i want every american out there who heard this program to start doing the same
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:41.000]  thing in their communities with these people
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.440]  who are in law enforcement who are breaking the law
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:48.680]  and that includes judges and politicians uh all of whom
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:54.760]  feed from the the same sewer and it's been going on for a long time
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:00.200]  it's a minority usually of people within law enforcement
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:03.560]  most people in law enforcement try to do the right thing
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:07.720]  but you know they have the code uh you got to protect each other
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:11.320]  well i heard said it two days ago former head of the FBI crime lab he said
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:15.240]  they're good at the bottom but the sewage is at the top
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:19.400]  well it's the same thing in any other organization
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:25.320]  and you know to have people in law enforcement involved in narcotics
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:30.280]  which affect generally mostly children is dreadful
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:34.280]  and you know we see these things going on all over the country
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:37.560]  and i you know i think what happens to a lot of these men
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:40.920]  especially those who are in higher positions that had been
[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:45.000]  in law enforcement for a number of years they just get hardened
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:49.720]  to everything and they are dealing with criminals for years
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:56.440]  and they adapt some of the same approach to life
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:00.280]  as criminals do because they're so exposed to them
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:03.800]  and i'm not trying to make excuses for them but it happens
[02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:07.000]  it's just like uh when someone's kidnapped
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.200]  uh they they find a relationship with the kidnapper
[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:17.480]  so that they can handle it the Stockholm syndrome
[02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:22.120]  that's right and you know one of the things i want to mention here
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:29.560]  is a comment of the OSS during the 1930 30s being involved with narcotics
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:33.720]  and they were taught how to do that by Emma who had been
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:38.920]  involved for many many many years in narcotics going back into the
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:43.240]  into the middle ages yeah back to the private crown chartered
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:47.880]  British East India Company that was the first private intelligence operatives
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:52.040]  in Europe and and then they branched out and
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:55.800]  when they took india and then they had the giant
[02:44:55.800 --> 02:45:00.040]  heroin trade going into into china which they
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:05.400]  had taken possession of and in most of those shippers who were doing the
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:10.040]  shipping for them were families from new england and new york
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:14.280]  who were in the shipping business and many of the great fortunes that
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:18.360]  exist on the east coast today came from
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:22.600]  running heroin from india to china for the british
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:28.200]  and that's well documented uh i think people should understand as well
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:33.320]  that the central intelligence agency people within that agency are deeply
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:36.440]  involved in this thing books have been written for the last
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:42.280]  25 or 30 years about the subject and there are many many people
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:47.560]  who are highly placed in government and close to government
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:50.280]  who have never been apprehended for what they've done
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:54.200]  who have been deeply involved in this and i'm not going to go in detail
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:58.680]  on it but you see what's going on in the Mexican border
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:05.800]  this is a fight which involves the US government via the CIA
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:09.080]  and the Mexican government to take over the drug trade this is what it's all
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:13.240]  about and the drug trade saying uh uh
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:17.160]  we're not going to let you do that because you're just a bit of criminals
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:21.400]  as we are so if you want it you're going to have to fight for it
[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:25.640]  and that's what that's all about and i thought i'd let people know that
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:28.440]  because our government in the united states
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:33.960]  is unbelievably corrupt far worse than anything you could imagine
[02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:38.040]  in any country for many many years
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:43.480]  bob shifting gears into the economy you're our expert on that uh what concerns
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:47.880]  you most with what's happening in the economy right now
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:51.400]  well i think that the sovereign debt problem
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:55.880]  there's 19 countries that are bankrupt and that includes the united states in
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:59.720]  great britain and i think they're going to have to wind
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:04.600]  this thing down they are using the injection of money and
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:07.720]  credit into the economy not only here but the g20
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:13.320]  countries as well these are the big countries and
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:18.120]  they have used stimulus in each country the stimulus is running out
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:23.240]  this month will be the last month the money and credit has been withdrawn to
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:28.360]  some extent if they do not continue they the
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:33.240]  treasury the fed reserve the central banks and these major
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:37.720]  countries if they don't continue to inject money in system
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:41.720]  one way or another the system is going to collapse
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:47.080]  and i've said from the very beginning this didn't happen
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:53.240]  because it was incompetence or greed this was planned this way
[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:56.760]  and so we don't know when they're going to pull
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:01.160]  the plug and create deflationary depression but it's coming
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:04.920]  and it could come very quickly i'm looking at
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:09.000]  about a year and a half maybe two years and they're going to have to pull the
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:12.120]  plug because they can't control it anymore
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:16.840]  and it passed the point of no return they cannot go back
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:21.000]  and believe me they're terrified and we have
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:26.040]  true positive of that of the way that they've gone after people like yourself
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:31.320]  and of course me for many years and they're going to go after other people
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:36.440]  in anybody that exposes the crimes that they're involved in
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:41.800]  whether it's narcotics or pedophilia or white slavery
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:45.960]  all of these things which they're involved in
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:49.960]  anybody is going to get a lot of heat bob let's break this down though with the
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:54.280]  heat is created alex it shows you that we're being
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:58.360]  very effective but but as the imf and world bank
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:02.920]  documents from 2002 state as other reports from inside the system admit
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:07.160]  they created the derivatives bubble they intended to implode the economy
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:11.320]  but now you're saying they're scared i mean has it gotten out of hand for them
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:14.200]  i mean if they set all this up and we know they did
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:18.200]  then why are you saying they're panicking and scared
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:23.000]  because they are i don't think they want to go through with it but they have to
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:27.080]  and so they're trying to devise when they can do it with the least amount of
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:30.440]  heat now you've seen Greece Greece's bankrupt has
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:35.160]  been for 10 years or more and so they brought it up deliberately
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:39.640]  to see what the air reaction was and what they intend to do
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:42.760]  is to take all the countries that are bankrupt
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:46.520]  and there'll be the 19 of them i can assure you
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:50.120]  they're going to bring them all down together and that's why i've said in the
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:53.320]  program before they're going to have a meeting just like
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:58.200]  the meetings that were held in the 1970s called Smithsonian
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:01.880]  and the plaza record and the louvre court they all get together
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:05.800]  they devalue all the currencies and they default on the debt
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:09.960]  and they have a deflationary depression in a war at the same time
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:12.680]  and that's what they're up to and that's where they're headed and we're
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:16.600]  exposing it and they don't like it and that's why we're getting heat
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:21.720]  and believe me if they knew where i was i wouldn't be around
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:26.040]  that's right you had to leave the united states uh what a decade ago
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:30.280]  no seven years ago the last time but that's not the first time
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:36.120]  it started in the in the 1960s yeah for those that don't know bob has been

[02:50:52.200 --> 02:50:55.080]  fed run militias then get mad and say i'm criticizing

[02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:47.560]  for more than a decade before we took the nation back it was an info war
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:54.120]  bob chatman speaking of info war uh... militias are incredibly infiltrated we
[02:54:54.120 --> 02:54:58.200]  support the militia it's constitutional but i've noticed that fed run
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:02.200]  militias always attack me when i warn other militias they're being set up
[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:06.440]  i warned hitari in august of last year and got attacked for it saying they're
[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:10.360]  getting ready to set you up out of 400 militias that are public
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:13.080]  i called it right because i could see what was happening
[02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:17.800]  um... the net explain the people going into this month of april
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:22.760]  your take on how they're gonna try to provocateur or do you agree with me
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:25.880]  review and you know they've used it for years i mean
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:29.720]  you can go back into the nineteen sixties with the minute man
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:34.360]  i mean how many people of you have you have even heard of the minute man
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:37.560]  it was a very large strong organization throughout
[02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:41.000]  the united states sort of a more militant
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.800]  type of pro-american patriot movement than the john burt society was
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:52.040]  which is more into education and they infiltrated like mad
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:57.480]  and in it happened at every level and so you had to be very careful said what
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:01.000]  you did and they're still doing it today
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:05.640]  i mean i had i had people from the federal government
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:11.480]  try to plant grenades in my garage unfortunately i caught them
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:15.080]  and i told them that they came back i kill them
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:19.240]  and fortunately they didn't get them back and uh... i want i put up with the
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:23.880]  sort of thing for years bob will be very careful who you're dealing with
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:28.200]  bob i've learned this fourteen years ago when i would warn militia people or
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:31.640]  catch fake militias lying about me that the fed run
[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:35.400]  militias when you warn other militias they attack you and you're not supposed
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:38.440]  to warn militias about infiltration that is
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:43.000]  two plus two equals four anybody attacking me for warning militias
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  and saying i'm attacking militias and and and telling lies
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.520]  obviously they are super suspect you agree
[02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:55.000]  absolutely you know i've seen it i i've gone through it
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:59.080]  uh... i've had a people for government go to people who i knew
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:03.560]  very well in threatened to put them in jail unless they set me up
[02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:07.480]  and they would say to the uh... and this happened several times
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:12.280]  that uh... you don't scare me he does
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:17.320]  and they went away and didn't come back
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:22.440]  why do you think i have so many people they got a particular
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:27.240]  well you know the word for you because i work with the government they train me
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:30.280]  they figure they own me that's that's the

[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:05.880]  washington and uh... he was reading my
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:09.640]  file from the central intelligence agency and i said

[03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:53.240]  you're gonna help us out there especially help people like the gentleman
[03:00:53.240 --> 03:00:57.000]  and his wife who just on here it's incredible what they're going through
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:01.560]  and i'm sure these sort of things are going on throughout the country
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:05.240]  and we can't have that i see reports every day that
[03:01:05.240 --> 03:01:08.440]  dwarf even that it's just i know these people it's it's it's
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:11.720]  it's happening all around us for the average person in government though who's
[03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:14.760]  even involved in corruption they're compartmentalized they don't get the
[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:17.880]  big picture they haven't studied it i mean now the government's openly
[03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:21.480]  announcing every week they're going to start taking pension funds
[03:01:21.480 --> 03:01:24.200]  i mean that's now what the good guys do and they're going to use homeland
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:28.280]  security to make sure it happens i mean this is pure evil they've thrown their
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:31.080]  lot in with pure evil it's not too late for a lot of these
[03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:37.800]  guys that work for the evil to make the decision to join the patriots
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:41.800]  and exit and you know that's where they get them they
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:45.400]  they need to make a living and of course the economy is terrible
[03:01:45.400 --> 03:01:48.200]  and if you leave your post and where are you going to work
[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:52.760]  they're not even hard at heart uh hiring garbage garbage collectors
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:55.400]  it's bad out there and it's going to get a lot worse
[03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:59.400]  and so these people a lot of them are trapped they say well i don't want to
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:02.120]  do that well if you don't you're out of here
[03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:05.320]  you just like that the the policemen they say look
[03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:08.920]  you're going to write 40 seconds a month and that's the end of it
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:12.280]  if you don't you know you're going to either be demoted or
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:15.800]  you will get a replacement and then they lie about it and say there aren't
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:19.000]  quotas but now they admit there's quotas
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:24.280]  finally after you know what a hundred years
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:28.680]  you know some states are really dreadful and i gotta let it today from
[03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:31.640]  someone who lived in new jersey and he said i mean
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:36.440]  it's incredible i mean they they need to raise revenues so badly
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:39.400]  but they're they're it doesn't matter whether you break
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:43.720]  uh the law and fractions they're going to pull you over anyway
[03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:47.400]  because they need the money well that's what robin hood went through and that's
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:51.160]  what all of our ancestors regardless of what color you are where you came from
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:54.760]  this is the old fight you get corrupt government it gets filled with criminals
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:57.960]  they start robbing everybody and there's no doubt
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:03.240]  we've got a really bad brand of tyranny taking over the west but the people are
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:06.520]  waking up dr frantic white horse thinks things are better now than they were a
[03:03:06.520 --> 03:03:09.960]  decade ago we just now know things are bad so it
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:14.760]  seems like it's worse he thinks the tide is starting to turn you agree
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:21.720]  don't know uh i i hope he's right but i never do things on hope
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:25.560]  i always try to deal with the cold hard facts that i can
[03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:30.040]  see and what i might be able to back into knowing
[03:03:30.040 --> 03:03:33.720]  the only way you can understand these people particularly at the other level
[03:03:33.720 --> 03:03:38.440]  upper levels is understanding the very sophisticated
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:41.880]  criminal mind and if you can understand
[03:03:41.880 --> 03:03:45.400]  with it you know the next thing that this criminal is going to do
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:48.440]  you can stop them and we know what they're going to do
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:55.960]  uh the invisible government right there you've got it right there in the dvd
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:03:59.320]  that's what we're going to get out to people so they can better understand
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:02.840]  what they're dealing with people in four thousand dollar suits
[03:04:02.840 --> 03:04:07.800]  running around robbing the world do you agree that
[03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:12.120]  they're going to stage events very very soon to be blind on the tea party
[03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:16.200]  yes and uh it just won't be the tea party to be all over the place and
[03:04:16.200 --> 03:04:20.040]  they don't have to be major events they they can be small ones
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:24.520]  they want to keep people's minds in turmoil that's why they create these
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:27.640]  wars uh people don't worry about economics and
[03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:31.480]  finance if they think they're three boys who are over in afghanistan
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:36.680]  iraq and say haiti are going to get killed tomorrow morning
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:39.240]  they're more concerned about that and that's why they have these wars of
[03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:43.160]  course they want to get rid of people too and they want to destroy the economy
[03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:46.760]  so that everybody's too busy trying to pay the rent and pay the car payment the
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:50.040]  insurance payment or fighting off the cps to
[03:04:50.040 --> 03:04:52.760]  stand up against corruption bob thanks for spending time with us the

[03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:32.360]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to
[03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:36.680]  establish an oppressive world government i believe first of all that we now need
[03:05:36.680 --> 03:05:40.520]  nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system global

[03:06:11.240 --> 03:06:14.440]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[03:06:14.440 --> 03:06:17.400]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[03:06:17.400 --> 03:06:20.600]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[03:06:20.600 --> 03:06:23.720]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[03:06:23.720 --> 03:06:27.160]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:14.280]  a couple months ago texas monthly uh
[03:08:14.280 --> 03:08:17.720]  history for now called me to an in-depth interview
[03:08:17.720 --> 03:08:20.840]  i thought it was gonna be a bad headpiece just mainstream media always does
[03:08:20.840 --> 03:08:24.440]  hit pieces but it was pretty fair i mean i'd say 80 percent accurate
[03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:28.360]  uh and i'd actually interviewed the reporter who exposed to lia texas drug
[03:08:28.360 --> 03:08:32.600]  dealing and how they had right at half the black population of the town in the
[03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:35.960]  jail owned by the local boss hog they were planting drugs on him
[03:08:35.960 --> 03:08:42.040]  uh and nat blaseley and then they said yeah we've got dan winners uh
[03:08:42.040 --> 03:08:45.560]  doing the photo shoot and i don't i mean i like photography but i'm not a
[03:08:45.560 --> 03:08:50.440]  photography uh you know expert or a photography buff but i knew
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:53.960]  the name dan winners because he's in the top two or three four
[03:08:53.960 --> 03:08:57.880]  reporters not just in the us but in the world time magazine newsweek
[03:08:57.880 --> 03:09:02.120]  i mean you name it this guy has photographed you know all the top
[03:09:02.120 --> 03:09:05.560]  politicians all the top writers all the top spiritual leaders hollywood

[03:09:20.520 --> 03:09:24.760]  winners was and then he built a whole stage a whole set for me
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:28.680]  out in his place out in the texas hill country and then he was telling me
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:32.840]  in between the shoots uh you know all these wild stories about different
[03:09:32.840 --> 03:09:36.680]  politicians or people he refused to photograph or and so
[03:09:36.680 --> 03:09:40.360]  he's here until the end of the show end of the hour
[03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:43.720]  and so we're very very honored to have him here where the stan winners began
[03:09:43.720 --> 03:09:46.760]  his career in photography as a photojournalist in his hometown
[03:09:46.760 --> 03:09:50.840]  in ventura county california widely recognized for his celebrity

[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:17.640]  photography icon and he is here with us dan thanks for being here
[03:10:17.640 --> 03:10:21.320]  good to see you all good to see you you bet
[03:10:21.320 --> 03:10:24.520]  last time it was under totally different circumstances but i'm at the
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:28.280]  receiving end of the sharp stick now rather than you so it's good to be well
[03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:31.480]  i'll tell you you did an amazing job i mean yeah i was pretty thrilled these
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:33.880]  are some incredible photo in fact we'll put some of the photos he took of me
[03:10:33.880 --> 03:10:37.400]  up there and then some of the others uh you're here i appreciate you coming in
[03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:40.440]  i mean you're on the big conspiracy terrorist show yeah that's good that's
[03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:42.920]  good i'm i'm you know the thing about you and the thing
[03:10:42.920 --> 03:10:46.360]  about what you do and what you guys do i think is that uh
[03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:50.360]  you know it's more than a full-time job to keep keep track of all this stuff and
[03:10:50.360 --> 03:10:54.120]  so you know you know the the normal joe goes to work
[03:10:54.120 --> 03:10:57.880]  he comes home from work he kicks back he has his beer he watches fox news
[03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:00.920]  he doesn't have time to pay attention to this stuff and so i've always admired
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:03.560]  people regardless of whether a position was that kind of
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:07.480]  really pay attention to this stuff and you know i've done i've dabbled in it
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:11.560]  you know and i i think the most kind of almost one of the most sort of insulting
[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:15.240]  or at least uh kind of patronizing sort of responses
[03:11:15.240 --> 03:11:18.760]  that uh that people give me whenever i talk about these issues is
[03:11:18.760 --> 03:11:23.720]  you know uh instantly that you're like demoted to oh you're a conspiracy
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:26.200]  theorist rather than having like an open-minded
[03:11:26.200 --> 03:11:29.080]  conversation about something that you've looked into it's like you know i looked
[03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:33.080]  into you know flight 93 for example you know i became curious i'm interested
[03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:35.960]  in aerospace i i heard some of the reports well you
[03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:39.000]  know they were making cell phone calls and this and that and i'm like well you
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:42.440]  know the infrastructure for a cell phone call from 30 000 feet
[03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:46.200]  isn't in place and it's you know i have no idea what happened it's neither here
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:49.880]  nor there but i i question it from like a scientific standpoint like well
[03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:52.840]  how did that happen you know so i start researching that and i start researching
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:56.600]  like capabilities in the eastern corridor altitudes that cell phone signals
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:11:59.800]  will reach etc etc and it like doesn't make sense you know and
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:03.640]  then there's all these cell phone or communications experts and technicians
[03:12:03.640 --> 03:12:06.760]  and you know electronics technicians that you can find online that are saying
[03:12:06.760 --> 03:12:09.800]  like hey you know it's neither here nor there but i can
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:12.840]  tell you right now that no one made a cell phone call from 30 000 and it came
[03:12:12.840 --> 03:12:17.080]  out last year in fbi documents uh that the solicitor general had never got a
[03:12:17.080 --> 03:12:21.080]  call from his wife and didn't talk to her fbi admitted that it came out two weeks
[03:12:21.080 --> 03:12:25.400]  ago uh the aclu sued and got the documents were cheney ordered the
[03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:28.760]  commission not to look at the attacks and it was a cover-up we have six of the
[03:12:28.760 --> 03:12:30.840]  ten commissioners saying it's a criminal cover-up
[03:12:30.840 --> 03:12:34.360]  john farmer but then we're not supposed to even ask questions as citizens i know
[03:12:34.360 --> 03:12:37.160]  we're supposed to sit down and shut up well you know you look at it too and you
[03:12:37.160 --> 03:12:39.880]  look at the evidence and you look oftentimes what happens is with any
[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:43.720]  crime scene is you know the first responders are the only ones that get
[03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:47.400]  any imagery after that it's completely closed off so they made this like
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:51.960]  ridiculous uh airplane shaped uh pit in the ground
[03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:54.760]  that had some smoldering embers almost like they put some
[03:12:54.760 --> 03:12:59.080]  charcoal in there and ignited it you know and the official sort of fbi and
[03:12:59.080 --> 03:13:02.520]  they handled it as a crime scene so the fbi handled the site the fbi
[03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:06.120]  didn't is that right yes so they made this really ridiculous looking
[03:13:06.120 --> 03:13:10.360]  airplane shaped crater that was smoldering and that was obviously to
[03:13:10.360 --> 03:13:14.600]  sort of you know to uh uh uh uh to please the media with you know some
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:17.480]  sort of like visual and uh and and there was this
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:21.320]  ridiculous diagram that came out that i saw that i wish i had actually brought
[03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:26.360]  um that was the official ff fbi um version of how the crash took
[03:13:26.360 --> 03:13:29.880]  place and what happened and so basically what they said is the airplane came
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:34.360]  down in a straight dive hit the ground and the entire plane went under the
[03:13:34.360 --> 03:13:36.440]  ground that and they had a diagram that drawn
[03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:39.960]  meanwhile separately the state police said an eight mile debris field engines
[03:13:39.960 --> 03:13:43.800]  five miles away i know i know which indicates high altitude
[03:13:43.800 --> 03:13:47.480]  you know catastrophic failure at high altitude which indicates a missile
[03:13:47.480 --> 03:13:51.640]  obviously you know you know it's kind of like it's the most ridiculous thing and
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:54.440]  and once again you know my friends instantly you know they're like well
[03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:57.080]  what do you think happened what do you think this what do you think that i'm
[03:13:57.080 --> 03:14:01.800]  like you know look i i don't know i don't i don't know why i don't know how i i
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:05.400]  can tell you though that that aircraft didn't hit the ground in one piece
[03:14:05.400 --> 03:14:09.160]  because obviously you know an engine isn't going to end up five miles away
[03:14:09.160 --> 03:14:12.840]  from a crash site you can look at you know crash site after crash site after
[03:14:12.840 --> 03:14:15.560]  crash site that you know that's been investigated by the
[03:14:15.560 --> 03:14:19.560]  fba that's widely photographed and when a plane you know breaks up an altitude
[03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:23.320]  the debris field you know flight 111 over uh over um
[03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:29.160]  you know um in uh lockerby no no that was 111 was the one in uh in uh
[03:14:29.160 --> 03:14:32.680]  novus kosher novus kosher yeah that was well we know debris fields even when
[03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:35.960]  they crash into mountains or fields that they're
[03:14:35.960 --> 03:14:39.640]  normally hundreds and hundreds of yards long absolutely contained reasonably
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:43.080]  contained right but at altitude the lockerby one how big was the debris
[03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:46.920]  field there massive yes high altitude burst etc so
[03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:50.600]  you know it's one of the things where it's so insulting you know if you do
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:53.560]  you know if you if you have an open mind you have an understanding of some of
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:55.800]  these things which you know i'm interested in these things
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:59.880]  and you do two hours of research with existing imagery
[03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:03.400]  you know it's it's ludicrous that you would try to be sold
[03:15:03.400 --> 03:15:07.080]  that wine then you've got building seven well building seven i know you're an
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:10.360]  expert on i don't know as much about it but i have researched the panic on one
[03:15:10.360 --> 03:15:14.600]  quite a bit and that's another one that's absolutely ludicrous
[03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:18.200]  there's no engine holes and there's a 16 foot hole there's a 16 foot hole no
[03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:20.680]  engine holes and if you know you know the structural
[03:15:20.680 --> 03:15:23.800]  integrity of an aircraft once it's compromised those things are made out
[03:15:23.800 --> 03:15:26.600]  of thin aluminum they you know once it's compromised those
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:30.680]  things will you know they'll crush so easily right but the engines are these
[03:15:30.680 --> 03:15:34.120]  masses right of titanium they're heavy heavy heavy
[03:15:34.120 --> 03:15:37.880]  they're not going to break up though you know it's like uh if you see any
[03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:40.840]  imagery of car bombs in the middle east for example
[03:15:40.840 --> 03:15:43.640]  you know you have the entire car completely disintegrated right but
[03:15:43.640 --> 03:15:47.240]  there's always an engine block sitting there that thing does not break up you
[03:15:47.240 --> 03:15:51.800]  know it's the one piece that like stays intact so you know when you see
[03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:55.240]  even on the debris field in flight 93 right the debris fields
[03:15:55.240 --> 03:15:58.360]  eight miles wide there's an engine five miles away the the photographs of the
[03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:01.160]  engine are the engine is intact it's an engine
[03:16:01.160 --> 03:16:06.040]  so when when the when the when the cruise missiles what i think in it uh
[03:16:06.040 --> 03:16:09.800]  hit the pentagon on either side of that hole there should have been massive
[03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:13.560]  holes and the windows aren't even broken it's like a most insulting and then
[03:16:13.560 --> 03:16:16.040]  later after hours of fire part of the roof caves in
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:19.240]  exactly and they try to show that on the news we have hundreds of these big
[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:21.400]  high-deaf photos that the government even took
[03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:24.760]  and it's a smoking hole that looks like a perfect missile blasts and everybody
[03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:27.480]  smelled cordite then they released some blurry
[03:16:27.480 --> 03:16:31.080]  image six years after that doesn't even show anything and say there's the
[03:16:31.080 --> 03:16:34.120]  there's the plane exactly they had hundreds of high-deaf cameras they won't
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:38.040]  release those right of course and and the in the one image that they do release
[03:16:38.040 --> 03:16:43.160]  if you lay a fifth 757 over the size of that image it's dwarfed you know it's a
[03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:47.480]  small it's a small it has a small profile small signature and 757 would
[03:16:47.480 --> 03:16:50.840]  dwarf that thing and make a bigger hole and the wings and the engines it's
[03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:55.640]  it's like ludicrous and the fact that it you know happened to hit the you know
[03:16:55.640 --> 03:17:00.040]  mainly unoccupied section of the pentagon right it was under construction
[03:17:00.040 --> 03:17:03.240]  why do they think we're so dumb I don't know I don't know and you know the other
[03:17:03.240 --> 03:17:06.680]  thing too is I know a lot of pilots have flown quite a bit in my life
[03:17:06.680 --> 03:17:12.040]  the idea that you know setting up an approach to hit a runway starts 20 or
[03:17:12.040 --> 03:17:16.200]  30 or 50 miles away from the runway because you get into your approach you
[03:17:16.200 --> 03:17:20.600]  set it up and you go into like a controlled descent and basically you
[03:17:20.600 --> 03:17:24.040]  fly the aircraft right to the ground right so the idea that these guys and
[03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:27.160]  you know it's precision it's precision to hit a runway it's precision to hit the
[03:17:27.160 --> 03:17:33.160]  end of runway and so you and so what you do is you you you take these guys that
[03:17:33.160 --> 03:17:37.320]  supposedly like took some classes on how to steer an aircraft and you're trying
[03:17:37.320 --> 03:17:42.360]  to sell me the idea that they were able to hit the pentagon precisely put it
[03:17:42.360 --> 03:17:47.640]  into a put it into a controlled descent get into ground effect and you know hit
[03:17:47.640 --> 03:17:51.880]  it like what 12 feet above the ground like perfect like perfect like hundreds
[03:17:51.880 --> 03:17:55.080]  of top pilots said they couldn't do that on their best day I know they couldn't
[03:17:55.080 --> 03:17:58.760]  even do it they couldn't be that precise with it because you know getting in into
[03:17:58.760 --> 03:18:02.840]  ground effect where you're riding on that air cushion and riding it right into
[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:07.400]  that even when they've had 50 60 miles to get ready you come in and only the
[03:18:07.400 --> 03:18:10.840]  best pilots can set them down smooth but still you they have to time it just
[03:18:10.840 --> 03:18:15.160]  right and that's why a runways 9000 feet and the plane comes in like this it
[03:18:15.160 --> 03:18:18.760]  doesn't come in near them perfectly it's ridiculous so tell me about building
[03:18:18.760 --> 03:18:21.560]  seven because you know more about that no no Dan we've got you here that's why I
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:24.920]  knew you'd be perfect for radio because you and I were just you know really
[03:18:24.920 --> 03:18:26.840]  headed off and we're talking you said you had a lot of friends that were
[03:18:26.840 --> 03:18:30.760]  listeners and I'm just honored to have you here and I wanted to talk about

[03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:45.480]  I think the the thing I'm most grateful for in my life is that you know every day
[03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:50.120]  I get up and I do exactly what I love to do and you know I think the majority of
[03:18:50.120 --> 03:18:53.400]  the people that are you know have an interest have a hobby you know it's an
[03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:57.640]  after work in enterprise you know it can't be parlayed into a career and yeah
[03:18:57.640 --> 03:19:01.560]  I don't know I feel really fortunate about it but also I on some level I'm not
[03:19:01.560 --> 03:19:04.920]  really surprised to buy it you know because it was always my passion it was
[03:19:04.920 --> 03:19:07.560]  always what I felt like I would do if you follow your passion and do it because
[03:19:07.560 --> 03:19:10.280]  it's a passion you're gonna be successful 100 percent everybody else

[03:19:14.360 --> 03:19:18.440]  passion exactly yeah if you if you know it's the way you're expressing your
[03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:22.440]  passion in the universe someone told me that uh said if the universe if you have

[03:24:40.840 --> 03:24:44.760]  almost like a lens take the spirit of somebody and then magnify it i think
[03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:47.960]  that's what danwinners does and we're going to talk about
[03:24:47.960 --> 03:24:52.840]  how you're able to do that or is it just a kind of an idiot savant uh i'm not
[03:24:52.840 --> 03:24:55.400]  saying you're an idiot but you know what i mean like some some i mean i see i
[03:24:55.400 --> 03:24:57.560]  think of myself with political stuff sometimes it's just
[03:24:57.560 --> 03:25:01.800]  you just know you have that talent but going back to the term conspiracy
[03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:05.320]  theorist you're right it's just a label they throw on people
[03:25:05.320 --> 03:25:09.880]  to say oh this information can't be looked at this information
[03:25:09.880 --> 03:25:14.520]  it's a way to downgrade it when really just questioning the system
[03:25:14.520 --> 03:25:18.040]  is what any free humans supposed to do i mean here's the global mail today
[03:25:18.040 --> 03:25:21.160]  the dangerously unbalanced world of global governance
[03:25:21.160 --> 03:25:24.440]  they're admitting world governments being established it's run by the banks
[03:25:24.440 --> 03:25:26.920]  but but then they say you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't want to
[03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:30.760]  be a slave of banks exactly exactly and then there's that you know and i'm
[03:25:30.760 --> 03:25:34.600]  i'm sure you've probably used the quote uh on your show probably on more than
[03:25:34.600 --> 03:25:37.480]  one occasion but there's that great quote by gearing
[03:25:37.480 --> 03:25:41.800]  from the nuremberg trials that says you know uh the normal people don't want
[03:25:41.800 --> 03:25:45.400]  war but after all it's not the normal people that are making the policy
[03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:48.920]  you know the it's the politicians that are making the policy and it's very
[03:25:48.920 --> 03:25:51.960]  easy to bring the normal people along all you have to do is convince them that
[03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:54.360]  they're being attacked and denounce the pacifist
[03:25:54.360 --> 03:25:58.760]  the pacifist for lack of patriotism patriotism it works every time
[03:25:58.760 --> 03:26:02.520]  and that is so true you know the the whole idea of like questioning anything
[03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:06.440]  i mean even the fact that you know how contrived the term patriot act was you
[03:26:06.440 --> 03:26:10.520]  know so it implies that if you like if you resisted at all that oh man you're
[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:14.360]  not patriotic or the new freedom initiative to put half of america's kids
[03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:17.800]  on psychotropic drugs that's a new freedom yeah absolutely
[03:26:17.800 --> 03:26:21.240]  absolutely what about the i mean talk locally you know what about the uh the
[03:26:21.240 --> 03:26:24.760]  police chief in austin with the mandatory you know if you refuse
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:29.000]  breathalyzer the mandatory blood test without even having warrants where they
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:32.680]  take you to a hospital and they violate your physical body
[03:26:32.680 --> 03:26:35.480]  to get blood out of you and now they're trying to the cops to do it it's
[03:26:35.480 --> 03:26:39.240]  unbelievable to me that anybody would stand for that for one second i mean
[03:26:39.240 --> 03:26:42.360]  clearly historically there's been policies that have been
[03:26:42.360 --> 03:26:45.560]  administered that have you know if it's taken a while to get rid of them because
[03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:48.680]  you have to go through the appellate courts into the supreme court and then
[03:26:48.680 --> 03:26:51.880]  suddenly it's deemed like unconstitutional but in the meantime
[03:26:51.880 --> 03:26:55.000]  you know people are being in believe me you know i think drunk driving is
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:58.280]  aberrant and i would not participate in at all but the idea that you can
[03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:01.560]  actually like take blood out of someone's body well they undermine the
[03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:05.000]  bill of rights and constitution for a supposed greater good but we know
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:08.520]  they're scientifically really just targeting the general population it's
[03:27:08.520 --> 03:27:11.560]  like homeland security we've gotten their internal documents it's really all
[03:27:11.560 --> 03:27:13.880]  pointed at the american people from the beginning
[03:27:13.880 --> 03:27:17.720]  absolutely i did a i did a really interesting piece and i wish i had
[03:27:17.720 --> 03:27:21.720]  actually given you the photograph but i was hired by magazine to
[03:27:21.720 --> 03:27:24.760]  actually a squire and they were doing a piece on
[03:27:24.760 --> 03:27:32.200]  the f a on f a a and the um and the uh tsa people and the way they screen and
[03:27:32.200 --> 03:27:37.000]  they what they the the the guy that is was the head of the program
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  within the f a a to test screening and he was the ex navy seal
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:44.840]  and his job he had a small group of individuals and their job was to
[03:27:44.840 --> 03:27:48.440]  breach airport security and so what they would do is they'd look for patterns
[03:27:48.440 --> 03:27:51.400]  they'd go into airport they'd look for patterns they do exactly what you would
[03:27:51.400 --> 03:27:54.360]  do if you were trying to breach our airport security
[03:27:54.360 --> 03:27:57.880]  you would educate yourself on what it was on their on their methods on their
[03:27:57.880 --> 03:28:01.320]  means and then you would do it right so the whole idea of like the tsa
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:04.360]  screening and stuff while i agree there should be some kind of you know checks
[03:28:04.360 --> 03:28:07.640]  and balances for people getting on an airplane it's such a band-aid when we
[03:28:07.640 --> 03:28:11.480]  go on jobs we carry on you know twenty five thousand dollars
[03:28:11.480 --> 03:28:15.960]  with the cameras and we carry them on and it's a big case full of electronic
[03:28:15.960 --> 03:28:20.440]  equipment that no one in no one in the tsa has
[03:28:20.440 --> 03:28:23.560]  any idea what they're looking at and they'll open it up and they'll kind of
[03:28:23.560 --> 03:28:26.120]  look through it and they'll close it up i mean who knows what the hell those
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:29.400]  well we know and then they've admitted all this tsa
[03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:32.840]  grabbing women's breasts grabbing men's genitals putting us through naked body
[03:28:32.840 --> 03:28:38.120]  scanners is to train us to have our privacy violated space violate
[03:28:38.120 --> 03:28:42.040]  yes exactly so get back to that square story so
[03:28:42.040 --> 03:28:45.960]  i i the the guy who's writing or the the guy that's
[03:28:45.960 --> 03:28:48.520]  being focused on is the guy that's the head of this
[03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:52.920]  you know sort of like rogue entity within the tsa slash faa
[03:28:52.920 --> 03:28:56.520]  whose job is to violate our breach airport security so
[03:28:56.520 --> 03:28:59.000]  you know what they do is they look for patterns and he came up with this whole
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.320]  method at kennedy said look you know there's like
[03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:04.360]  three flights to the middle east at like four o'clock in the afternoon out of
[03:29:04.360 --> 03:29:08.600]  kennedy and he said we've watched very closely the way tsa goes through stuff
[03:29:08.600 --> 03:29:11.160]  and they basically don't even look at anything the stuff's going on so he said
[03:29:11.160 --> 03:29:14.600]  that would be a prime target so they make a bomb looking device they put it in a
[03:29:14.600 --> 03:29:17.320]  bag and it gets through so he was doing this so
[03:29:17.320 --> 03:29:21.080]  my assignment from the magazine was okay why don't you what we need you to do is
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:23.960]  we need you to figure out how to take down an aircraft
[03:29:23.960 --> 03:29:28.040]  so i said okay so once again i go online i spend maybe six seven hours
[03:29:28.040 --> 03:29:31.880]  researching it i figure out what kind of explosive to make how you can make it
[03:29:31.880 --> 03:29:35.320]  it's not detectable by any of the carbon based
[03:29:35.320 --> 03:29:39.640]  testing methods that the tsa uses dan winners got a break that was a short
[03:29:39.640 --> 03:29:42.280]  segment long segment coming up let's finish that story when we get back
[03:29:42.280 --> 03:29:45.640]  then we'll get into some of the more interesting things you've seen in your

[03:33:14.600 --> 03:33:18.440]  that dan winners was telling about this shoot for esquire and we're going to get to some other
[03:33:18.440 --> 03:33:23.240]  important issues with him while we're scrolling great photos he's taken in the background uh
[03:33:23.240 --> 03:33:28.760]  for radio listeners you'll be able to see this archived at prison planet dot tv uh charlie sheen
[03:33:28.760 --> 03:33:34.360]  quits two and a half men and i don't normally get into entertainment news but this is not really
[03:33:34.360 --> 03:33:39.640]  stemming from the problems he's had you know good friend of mine nine eleven truth are really smart
[03:33:39.640 --> 03:33:44.440]  guy great guy i can just tell you all the stuff you've heard the news it's made up or exaggerated
[03:33:45.560 --> 03:33:52.120]  and uh his enemies will you know declare victory but a year ago he told me he wanted this to be his
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:59.480]  last season and uh just a few months ago he told me before the thing happened on christmas day uh
[03:33:59.480 --> 03:34:04.760]  that he probably wasn't going to re up his tv show but here's the new york post troubled charlie
[03:34:04.760 --> 03:34:10.360]  sheen says he's leaving hit cbs tv show two and a half men at the end of the season sheen who returned
[03:34:10.360 --> 03:34:16.120]  to a men's set last month after stent and rehab will call it quits after taping his final episode
[03:34:16.120 --> 03:34:20.200]  april night see that's not even true i know charlie wasn't drinking wasn't using drugs drinks way too
[03:34:20.200 --> 03:34:27.160]  much coffee and smoked marlboro reds so i spent a lot of time with him uh but he went to a uh
[03:34:27.160 --> 03:34:32.040]  basically a spa so that under the stress he wouldn't go back on alcohol or drugs he'd been off of
[03:34:32.040 --> 03:34:39.960]  for years so that's a lie here from his enemy the new york post but um his spokesman stan
[03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:45.880]  rosenthal did not deny the report charlie's deal is only through this current season he told people
[03:34:45.880 --> 03:34:50.520]  so there's the inside scoop here folks charlie quit because he wants to spend time with his family
[03:34:50.520 --> 03:34:57.960]  and is sick of eight plus seasons and the new york post and others are spinning this like his problem
[03:34:57.960 --> 03:35:02.360]  with his wife brook who's a nice person like that's why he's quitting that may have been the cherry
[03:35:02.360 --> 03:35:07.240]  on top but uh there's that info dan i apologize for digressing off into fluff but charlie's my
[03:35:07.240 --> 03:35:10.920]  friend i wanted to back him up and set the record straight yeah i don't think it's fluff he's done
[03:35:10.920 --> 03:35:16.200]  some good work i think well you know everybody's human and people love to see somebody big in
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:21.720]  trouble and and you know even when limbaugh got caught in stuff worse than what she's involved in
[03:35:21.720 --> 03:35:26.360]  i wasn't sharing his downfall even though i disagree with him passionately because i just don't
[03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:31.880]  i only cheer for real tyrants going down you know people like hitler or stall in her mouth
[03:35:31.880 --> 03:35:36.120]  i agree totally and i think the i think you're absolutely right but i think we love watching
[03:35:36.120 --> 03:35:41.000]  people ascend the ladder but we like watching the ladder fall over much better and it's you know
[03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:46.120]  what i think it is is i think that you know the the the media and the way the media works in the
[03:35:46.120 --> 03:35:50.760]  way publishing works etc and i'm a part of it so i mean i'd be one i'd you know i should be
[03:35:50.760 --> 03:35:54.920]  pointing the finger back at myself but the idea is to create a lure to create a lure so that
[03:35:54.920 --> 03:36:01.880]  someone feels larger than life and i think you know we talk about uh why film and why celebrities
[03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:07.320]  specifically like actors and and film why for some reason it is such a part of our collective
[03:36:07.320 --> 03:36:12.600]  consciousness and i think it's for that very reason you know i can go see i can go see
[03:36:12.600 --> 03:36:17.160]  the hurt locker and you can go see the hurt locker completely separately but we have a
[03:36:17.160 --> 03:36:24.280]  we have a an experience that provides connectivity and so you and i both now are connected through
[03:36:24.280 --> 03:36:28.440]  seeing that film we can talk about it we can talk about the issues around it etc so i think that's
[03:36:28.440 --> 03:36:33.400]  one reason and you know it stems and i think it's sick wanting to see somebody fall absolutely when
[03:36:33.400 --> 03:36:37.720]  this happens to our own families and neighbors this is sick this shows a sickness and i see it
[03:36:37.720 --> 03:36:42.920]  getting progressively worse that people love to see somebody in trouble but but but i interrupted
[03:36:42.920 --> 03:36:47.800]  you go ahead well i think to get to what you're saying right now too i think that you know i think
[03:36:47.800 --> 03:36:53.800]  that when someone gets really angry at someone who's suffering rather than look at it from love
[03:36:53.800 --> 03:36:58.920]  and attachment and with compassion i think it says something about the individual you know that's
[03:36:58.920 --> 03:37:04.840]  that's throwing the stones you know he he who is without sin may he cast the first stone i mean to
[03:37:04.840 --> 03:37:10.120]  do a biblical quote it's absolutely spot on you know we are all we are all fallible we're all
[03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:15.000]  failed we all have our own problems i realized several years ago that you know the one thing
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:19.720]  that we all have in common is that we all have problems period we all have problems and i think
[03:37:19.720 --> 03:37:24.040]  our role in life is to try to work through those problems and that's the human condition absolutely
[03:37:24.040 --> 03:37:30.280]  100 so yeah it is yeah i only want to bring down people that are hurting masses of innocents and
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:36.040]  who are consciously setting people up consciously hurting others consciously launching wars
[03:37:36.040 --> 03:37:42.360]  torturing people betraying uh that's why i hate these politicians and bush of course and obama
[03:37:42.360 --> 03:37:48.440]  expanding wars wiretapping continuing the torture continuing the arrest and and watching him use all
[03:37:48.440 --> 03:37:54.040]  of this hope that people had put into him against them and again i don't personally hate obama i know
[03:37:54.040 --> 03:38:00.520]  he's a puppet who they plan to destroy it's just that i realized that the institution itself
[03:38:00.520 --> 03:38:05.320]  is just so ruthless yeah the institution and i think that's a good point i worked with i worked
[03:38:05.320 --> 03:38:09.320]  with him um you know he seemed like one of those guys you'd want to go out and have a beer with
[03:38:09.320 --> 03:38:14.360]  he seemed like a totally cool guy i believe truthfully that when he was campaigning he has
[03:38:14.360 --> 03:38:18.920]  a lot of you know ethos that he adheres to that he really believes in but i think when you get
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:24.280]  in that office and they see the first day that you're briefed you know it's all bets are off you
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:28.760]  know i mean the first day he was like i'm we're closing closing guantanamo and i saw a photograph
[03:38:28.760 --> 03:38:34.120]  recently that was the most ironic photograph it was a picture of one of the one of the guards or
[03:38:34.120 --> 03:38:39.640]  one of the um you know one of the officials at guantanamo hanging his photo up in the lobby
[03:38:39.640 --> 03:38:44.840]  when you come in you know is the most ironic image considering you know if you've ever been to a
[03:38:44.840 --> 03:38:49.560]  military installation when you walk in the main building there's the chain of command so you know
[03:38:49.560 --> 03:38:53.640]  you'd walk in a building during bush's administration and bush was in the middle and then on either side
[03:38:53.640 --> 03:38:58.120]  there were photographs of the chain of command that goes down so at guantanamo there's the chain of
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:03.320]  command and there's obama the photograph of obama right in the middle and you know true once again
[03:39:03.320 --> 03:39:08.840]  you know i mean i i i truly believe like i wouldn't i wouldn't i won't weep when kissinger drops i won't
[03:39:08.840 --> 03:39:13.560]  weak when rock Rockefeller drops i don't think you know i don't think honestly anybody will and
[03:39:13.560 --> 03:39:17.160]  that's really unfortunate you know that they've lived a life like that but you know once again
[03:39:17.160 --> 03:39:22.200]  you know i try to view these things yeah their human journey is just a tragic event of power and
[03:39:22.200 --> 03:39:27.240]  avarice now i interrupted you with a break let's go back to that esquire piece uh that you were
[03:39:27.240 --> 03:39:32.760]  talking about recap it and then tell us about it okay the the assignment to get back to it there
[03:39:32.760 --> 03:39:38.040]  esquire was doing a piece on airport security and the idea of you know how difficult my assignment
[03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:44.040]  was dan research and illustrate how difficult it would be to take down an airliner and in
[03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:47.960]  initially i thought well that's kind of an irresponsible job it's it's kind of irresponsible
[03:39:47.960 --> 03:39:52.200]  to illustrate that but then i thought about it i thought well it's actually more irresponsible
[03:39:52.200 --> 03:39:57.080]  not to illustrate how easy it is because anybody that wants to take down an airliner is going to
[03:39:57.080 --> 03:40:00.200]  take down an airliner period you know they're going to do it they're going to do the research
[03:40:00.200 --> 03:40:05.000]  required and they're going to figure it out so i started looking into it and i spent several
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:09.720]  hours on the internet and i i you know i came up with a formula for an explosive that was
[03:40:09.720 --> 03:40:15.480]  non detectable by the by the screening that's used now which is all carbon based detection
[03:40:15.480 --> 03:40:20.280]  this is a chemical element it's it's got 80 percent of the destructive power or the explosive
[03:40:20.280 --> 03:40:26.920]  force at tnt and it can be made at your house it can be carried so the the method i came up with
[03:40:26.920 --> 03:40:31.960]  is this you know you get three guys working together and this is all based on the fact
[03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:35.160]  that these guys are going to off themselves but there doesn't seem to be a shortage of guys
[03:40:35.160 --> 03:40:39.880]  that are willing to uh and you're doing this drill to try to stop this from happening or to try to
[03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:44.120]  illustrate to people like hey look how easy this is you know look how easy it would be to do this
[03:40:44.120 --> 03:40:48.680]  you know and it's almost like a wake-up call it's like oh my god you know like you know we think
[03:40:48.680 --> 03:40:53.800]  these guys are or you know the security is is such a band-aid you know it's you know right after 9
[03:40:53.800 --> 03:40:58.280]  11 what was it like you couldn't walk two feet away from your bag without getting like scolded
[03:40:58.280 --> 03:41:02.440]  right now it's like i'll leave my bag at the gate ask someone to watch it go to the bathroom come
[03:41:02.440 --> 03:41:06.440]  back it's like no one's worried there was national guard in the airport when we go back to the point
[03:41:06.440 --> 03:41:10.600]  that most of its manufactured if you had time to see the underwear bombing i totally agree
[03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:15.000]  you know it's i mean the the state department says they were ordered by a us intelligence agency
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:19.640]  to help them get on the plane yeah okay so there you go so it's the same thing it's the whole idea
[03:41:19.640 --> 03:41:24.040]  of like you keep them in fear you know threat level orange threat level yellow threat level red
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:27.800]  i laugh when i hear that stuff when i'm at the airport because it reminds me of that green quote
[03:41:27.800 --> 03:41:31.160]  it's like you know keep them in fear keep them feeling like they're being repressed
[03:41:31.160 --> 03:41:35.800]  let me get back to the f-square thing so so i i i figure out the whole process to do this you
[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:41.000]  know you get three guys you have two guys carrying the explosive device and they're groin once again
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:46.280]  usually and this might be changing but usually even with a pat down they don't go right to that
[03:41:46.280 --> 03:41:53.400]  area you know so you can get that in and uh and um then uh you uh you take in a nine volt battery
[03:41:53.400 --> 03:42:01.400]  some wire a couple flashlight bulbs uh a i used a timer was a timer off of a dog feeder right that
[03:42:01.400 --> 03:42:05.800]  i bought it you know academy or something and so i took all the ideas you take all this stuff in
[03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:10.120]  in independently which is it'd be all be very easy to get in the only thing i thought would be
[03:42:10.120 --> 03:42:14.680]  difficult was maybe some duct tape so i thought well what you do is you'd line your entire bag
[03:42:14.680 --> 03:42:18.520]  with duct tape and then you could get it in and then you could pull the strips off and use it but
[03:42:18.520 --> 03:42:23.320]  then you go into the little kiosk you buy a couple bottles of coke and you all go to the men's room
[03:42:23.320 --> 03:42:28.600]  one guy goes into the handicap stall he spends about 15 minutes assembling the thing getting it
[03:42:28.600 --> 03:42:33.320]  all ready to go puts it on his bag takes it into the plane and then the research further was well
[03:42:33.320 --> 03:42:37.400]  okay so he blows it up in the plane it might compromise you know the hull it might do this it
[03:42:37.400 --> 03:42:41.480]  might do that but it probably wouldn't take it down so what you do then which is also another one
[03:42:41.480 --> 03:42:46.600]  of these ridiculous band aids is that you know once 9-11 happened they reinforced all the cockpit
[03:42:46.600 --> 03:42:50.760]  doors you know they made these kevlar doors you can't get in but what they didn't do is they didn't
[03:42:50.760 --> 03:42:57.160]  reinforce the bulkhead behind the captain or the co-pilot all they did is do a door so 757 and a
[03:42:57.160 --> 03:43:02.600]  couple other aircrafts have a in the first class cabin they have a bathroom that immediately backs
[03:43:02.600 --> 03:43:07.640]  up against the cockpit so you go in there and you detonate it and it's done and you know this was
[03:43:07.640 --> 03:43:13.960]  you know six hours of research on my part and so the idea is that it's incredibly simple to do this
[03:43:13.960 --> 03:43:18.280]  how long ago did you do that for escort i was like two years ago and i wish i had brought that image
[03:43:18.280 --> 03:43:23.800]  with me because what i did is i did a still life of all of the elements that were required what
[03:43:23.800 --> 03:43:29.080]  should we google uh dan winters esquire how to bomb a plane let's see do that it was esquire or
[03:43:29.800 --> 03:43:34.280]  best life i'm thinking after i said esquire i was thinking it might be best like do uh dan winters
[03:43:34.920 --> 03:43:40.600]  best life bomb and i bet it'll dan winters best life bomb did you guys have any luck because
[03:43:40.600 --> 03:43:44.840]  you want to also show people how fake the photo is with the newspaper and the rifle of lee harvey
[03:43:44.840 --> 03:43:50.280]  oswald in the front yard where the shadows are all wrong okay well we'll show that first and but
[03:43:50.280 --> 03:43:53.320]  we're running out of time here and i mean i knew it'd be great to have you on the radio because
[03:43:53.320 --> 03:43:59.720]  you've got so much knowledge and we're so similar in so many ways and our perspectives but i mean
[03:43:59.720 --> 03:44:02.520]  you were telling me stories and i don't know if some of them are off record or if you want to
[03:44:02.520 --> 03:44:07.000]  tell stories but what are some interesting stories about movie stars or politicians
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:11.800]  or rick perry or whatever that you can tell okay rick perry the hair politician the funniest
[03:44:11.800 --> 03:44:17.800]  story about rick perry i photographed him twice um you know he is the consummate the consummate
[03:44:17.800 --> 03:44:23.960]  smooth guy he comes in you almost instantly have a nickname he remembers your name it's this whole
[03:44:23.960 --> 03:44:27.960]  politician thing you know i've been other politicians you know a good friend of mine jack
[03:44:27.960 --> 03:44:33.240]  valenti who just passed recently he told me if you don't like bush don't spend 10 minutes in a
[03:44:33.240 --> 03:44:37.640]  room with him because you'll love him because he's that kind of you know you instantly get a nickname
[03:44:37.640 --> 03:44:42.200]  you instantly feel like you know has that ability to make you feel special you know and you know i
[03:44:42.200 --> 03:44:48.040]  you know i was offered twice to photograph him newsweek offered me a cover uh the the uh day
[03:44:48.040 --> 03:44:52.680]  after the election the initial election when he was when he was uh first voted president
[03:44:52.680 --> 03:44:58.280]  and i turned it down because i just fundamentally like i fundamentally can't like photograph someone
[03:44:58.280 --> 03:45:03.240]  well you know he he looks more like a demon when he does the smiles or like an evil clown
[03:45:03.240 --> 03:45:10.200]  that when he does that laughing i mean it it it upsets me and uh you know he had me arrested
[03:45:10.200 --> 03:45:13.880]  one time for just asking him a question i don't know if you've ever googled alex jones arrested
[03:45:13.880 --> 03:45:17.880]  for asking governor question at a press conference okay and asking about the world government they
[03:45:17.880 --> 03:45:22.200]  they just drugged me out and arrested me that right well i had a funny i had a funny uh run in
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:26.920]  with rick perry at a bicycle sports shop i went in there to get something and he was in there and
[03:45:26.920 --> 03:45:31.800]  he was in his bike outfit and he had his assistance with the big file of faxes and a couple of the
[03:45:31.800 --> 03:45:37.240]  capital police with him and uh so i heard him i was in there and i was kind of listening and
[03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:41.960]  i heard him talking to his assistant he said like okay i'm gonna go for a bike ride from 10 to 12
[03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:45.880]  then i'm gonna meet bill for lunch then after that i'm gonna do this and go for a run then i'm
[03:45:45.880 --> 03:45:50.520]  gonna go sweat you know this and i'm listening to all this and uh as soon as he finished it i was
[03:45:50.520 --> 03:45:55.400]  standing right next to him and i said uh you planning on doing any governing today because it
[03:45:55.400 --> 03:45:59.720]  sounds like his day was full of recreation you know but uh yeah these guys you know most of these
[03:45:59.720 --> 03:46:04.760]  guys and i think the point you brought up about bush's laugh my experience with politicians is
[03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:10.760]  they don't really know what they're supposed to do and so they have this kind of fake smile that
[03:46:10.760 --> 03:46:16.200]  they throw on and it's you know i've photographed phil graham one time and i and i and i said uh
[03:46:16.200 --> 03:46:20.280]  i said he kept doing this really bizarre smile and i was trying to get a shot that felt natural
[03:46:20.280 --> 03:46:24.600]  like we were talking about earlier you were talking about the idea of how to kind of like capture the
[03:46:24.600 --> 03:46:29.080]  essence of someone you know and when they're not taking direction and they're they're they're doing
[03:46:29.080 --> 03:46:32.680]  what they think a photograph is supposed to be you know i think a lot of people think like oh
[03:46:32.680 --> 03:46:37.160]  great photos of a sunset or something you know it's like super passe but once again the sunset
[03:46:37.160 --> 03:46:41.400]  inspires all of us people look at a photo of the sunset and it takes them to that point whatever
[03:46:41.400 --> 03:46:46.520]  the most common sort of genre of photographs but phil graham said uh i said yeah um maybe just
[03:46:46.520 --> 03:46:50.520]  relax your mouth maybe just do something serious and he said boy i worked on this smile for a long
[03:46:50.520 --> 03:46:56.760]  time i'm gonna smile so and it was the more painfully forced like smile you could possibly
[03:46:56.760 --> 03:47:01.560]  imagine but i don't even know where i like to photograph like out in the country old shot
[03:47:01.560 --> 03:47:06.680]  up washing machines in the way the bullets have gone through and the rust absolutely yeah that's
[03:47:06.680 --> 03:47:12.520]  the kind of stuff i like not that i'm i mean i i just like photographs you know that are of an old
[03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:18.920]  barn or old woman or sure sure i love all of your photos great thanks but because it does
[03:47:18.920 --> 03:47:23.880]  so i was accurate when i said that you somehow draw out the essence of people i try to and you know i
[03:47:23.880 --> 03:47:28.680]  think to a certain extent it's like a i've called it before i said i've called it a manufactured
[03:47:28.680 --> 03:47:35.000]  intimacy and i think the idea behind you know the the the range of human expression and human
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:40.680]  emotion is is so wide that i think what i try to do is i try to capture sort of like usually except
[03:47:40.680 --> 03:47:45.800]  for the the case with your crazy uh screaming photograph is that um but that's a part of your
[03:47:45.800 --> 03:47:50.360]  personality and see that was an accurate representation i suppose right but uh the idea is to
[03:47:50.360 --> 03:47:55.880]  just try to go to a place that feels pensive that feels introspective that feels you know quiet
[03:47:55.880 --> 03:48:00.120]  oftentimes it doesn't feel like it's you know manufactured doesn't feel like it's in genuine
[03:48:00.120 --> 03:48:04.440]  you know it's it's capturing a moment of that individual but i think it's a reflective moment
[03:48:04.440 --> 03:48:08.920]  and i think people respond to reflective moments why did you choose this photo as the cover page
[03:48:08.920 --> 03:48:13.560]  when you open the magazine i didn't the magazine did and i would have hoped what i was hoping is
[03:48:13.560 --> 03:48:20.040]  that the screaming photo was by itself with the uh my dream would have been the screaming photo was
[03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:26.120]  by itself and the typography on one side and then you turned to that photo and then the last photo
[03:48:26.120 --> 03:48:31.080]  was the one in the set you know i'd hope for that but i was really happy with so first show me in
[03:48:31.080 --> 03:48:35.560]  the screaming and then show the calm yeah i like that yeah just kind of jump back and forth because
[03:48:35.560 --> 03:48:41.400]  once again and i really like this very flattering photo you yeah it is you like that one that's
[03:48:41.400 --> 03:48:44.600]  your new head shot exactly well that's what i look like to myself when i'm looking in the mirror
[03:48:44.600 --> 03:48:50.920]  you know brushing my teeth and then i'm not really photogenic i mean i'm not i'm not very narcissistic
[03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:53.720]  but the same time you're looking at photos of yourself it's like that didn't really look like
[03:48:53.720 --> 03:48:58.120]  me of course absolutely and but your photos because i've met some of these famous people in person
[03:48:59.240 --> 03:49:03.480]  the photos you take of people is what they really look like yeah yeah that's a challenge when
[03:49:03.480 --> 03:49:08.120]  you're shooting someone famous by the way because you've seen them represented in the media so many
[03:49:08.120 --> 03:49:12.760]  times it's like how do you make that quintessential image and still have it to be a recognizable
[03:49:12.760 --> 03:49:16.920]  image and what i try to do in my photographs and i think to a large extent i'm successful
[03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:22.680]  is to try to create a timeless iconic image so that is not to use like fancy tricky lighting
[03:49:22.680 --> 03:49:28.920]  stuff to keep it really simple there he is let's quit looking at me now in fact we don't have much
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:32.200]  time run through some of the other photos at the end of that that we haven't seen of other people
[03:49:32.200 --> 03:49:36.440]  go ahead did we finally harvey oswald photo yet we're gonna show don't we come back sorry dan go
[03:49:36.440 --> 03:49:41.160]  ahead all right no problem i'm here directing while i'm on tv where we are you're right here
[03:49:41.160 --> 03:49:44.760]  just continue the direction of the flow of the conversation no it's just you were saying
[03:49:45.720 --> 03:49:49.400]  you were talking about how to oh to create a genuine moment and still have it be
[03:49:50.760 --> 03:49:54.920]  an accurate representation of what that individual looks like because once again you
[03:49:54.920 --> 03:49:59.080]  know people that are really widely known in the news and stuff it's very difficult to create an
[03:49:59.080 --> 03:50:03.400]  image that stands out and that's going to connect you because you've seen so many of them so the
[03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:07.800]  idea of trying to create you know try to heighten it to the point where it becomes iconic i guess
[03:50:07.800 --> 03:50:12.600]  ultimately and you know through the history of photography there are those single images that
[03:50:12.600 --> 03:50:16.760]  represent to everyone you know if i said lincoln there are a couple photographs even though he
[03:50:16.760 --> 03:50:20.840]  was photographed you know he wasn't actually photographed that many times like 12 times i think
[03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:24.760]  but there are a couple you know there's that one at the end of the war shortly before he was killed
[03:50:24.760 --> 03:50:29.240]  where you just see how completely decimated he had become from the war it looks like a corpse
[03:50:29.240 --> 03:50:34.440]  already unbelievable yeah just there's the iwo jima marines how exhausted they look at the triumph
[03:50:34.440 --> 03:50:38.840]  absolutely there's the sailor kissing the beautiful woman in new york alfred eisenstein
[03:50:38.840 --> 03:50:41.960]  and you could just capture that they're going to be having a great time together that night
[03:50:41.960 --> 03:50:48.680]  jill rosenthal with the flag raising shot and alfred eisenstein with the time square shot

[03:54:14.360 --> 03:54:20.040]  well there's the famous setup photo a photo shot from back in 1963 before they had photo shot of
[03:54:20.040 --> 03:54:26.280]  lee harvey oswald as a photographer uh what is wrong with that photograph well you know there are
[03:54:26.280 --> 03:54:32.600]  a lot of things wrong with it the most obvious thing for me is that the light is coming from
[03:54:33.160 --> 03:54:39.080]  his left from an angle and at a pretty low angle in the sky because you can see the shadow
[03:54:40.200 --> 03:54:45.800]  coming back from his body at about 10 o'clock so that would indicate a light source that's off his
[03:54:45.800 --> 03:54:53.240]  axis at about five o'clock and so that's inconsistent then with the lighting that's on his face
[03:54:53.240 --> 03:54:59.160]  the lighting that's on his face if you'll notice the shadow goes straight down from his nose 12 o'clock
[03:54:59.160 --> 03:55:05.560]  12 o'clock overhead his eyes uh both eye sockets are dark which indicates also an overhead light
[03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:10.440]  source so it's clearly a photograph that was staged the interesting thing about that is the
[03:55:10.440 --> 03:55:15.560]  entire house was cleaned out the day of the assassination by the dallas police department
[03:55:15.560 --> 03:55:21.720]  completely every single thing every dish every fork every knife every sheet everything and then
[03:55:21.720 --> 03:55:25.880]  two days later suddenly someone goes back to the house and supposedly finds the photo in the house
[03:55:25.880 --> 03:55:30.520]  and brings it in so it's clearly a fake photo and the thing about it is back then yeah they
[03:55:30.520 --> 03:55:34.840]  didn't have photoshop but what they could do is work at an incredibly large scale so they could
[03:55:34.840 --> 03:55:40.200]  have made a 20 by 24 print of the the person standing in for the image made a big giant print
[03:55:40.200 --> 03:55:45.880]  of a headshot from oswald that they had combined them and then re-photograph it and the print that
[03:55:45.880 --> 03:55:50.280]  they found was three inches by three inches so very difficult all right we don't have much time
[03:55:50.280 --> 03:55:54.280]  i want to have you back sometime no no i want i could have you for five hours uh shifting gears
[03:55:54.280 --> 03:55:58.280]  again i don't want to get i believe we do have a space program that went to the moon i've talked to
[03:55:58.280 --> 03:56:03.240]  top astronauts but they wanted to fake some photos for the public to not show the public what we
[03:56:03.240 --> 03:56:08.040]  really have what do you think of those moon photos well i think the most interesting thing about the
[03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:11.800]  moon photos is that there there are some problems with them there's some definite problems with
[03:56:11.800 --> 03:56:18.200]  them you know there i've i've actually photographed conrad grissom and um harrison schmidt harrison
[03:56:18.200 --> 03:56:22.520]  schmidt was the last person that sat foot on the moon conrad obviously we've interviewed him yeah
[03:56:22.520 --> 03:56:28.360]  exactly schmidt's amazing geologist um you know and the thing about it is that the the lighting
[03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:32.440]  is really inconsistent in those photographs based on you know the light source on the moon would be
[03:56:32.440 --> 03:56:37.800]  one singular source it would be the sun only so whether you got light on you or you don't so the
[03:56:37.800 --> 03:56:42.600]  shadows are all pure black and the highlights are all pure white because they're illuminated so the
[03:56:42.600 --> 03:56:49.320]  problem with you know the the photograph of of aldrin coming down off the lem you know that entire
[03:56:50.120 --> 03:56:54.440]  it's it's backlit and so the lem should be black it shouldn't be illuminated but it's illuminated
[03:56:54.440 --> 03:56:58.120]  but instead there's angles everywhere there yeah there's multiple shadows there's directional
[03:56:58.120 --> 03:57:02.680]  shadows there's a great uh there was a great photograph that nasa had that there are a film
[03:57:02.680 --> 03:57:07.720]  image that they had released which they've since pulled you know i think it got in under the radar
[03:57:07.720 --> 03:57:12.040]  and some people got it and they questioned it and it got pulled of the flag on the moon blowing
[03:57:12.040 --> 03:57:17.880]  yes you've seen that okay so as a top photographer who knows the whole science of it this is suspicious
[03:57:17.880 --> 03:57:21.320]  it's suspicious and you know i've looked in that or watched the documentary a funny thing
[03:57:21.320 --> 03:57:25.480]  happened on the way to the moon which there's a lot more stuff on there that's really inconsistent
[03:57:25.480 --> 03:57:29.880]  it was almost part of the same interest i had with the uh with the 9-11 stuff with the pentagon
[03:57:29.880 --> 03:57:34.360]  you know something seemed weird and we have a right to question it you look at unfortunately
[03:57:34.360 --> 03:57:38.840]  we're down to a minute and a half let's show the photo of his father here and and i described what
[03:57:38.840 --> 03:57:44.680]  i got from it you know that that it's you know it's almost like the sistine chapel where god's
[03:57:44.680 --> 03:57:49.160]  reaching down but also he's old he's wise he's strong but you said vulnerable yeah i think
[03:57:49.160 --> 03:57:53.800]  there's a lot of vulnerability in that image you know especially in his eyes you know it looks like
[03:57:53.800 --> 03:57:57.960]  to me you know that was a perfect photograph that's my favorite that i've ever done there are some of
[03:57:57.960 --> 03:58:02.440]  my son actually that would that would uh that would compete with that one for favorite photo but
[03:58:02.440 --> 03:58:06.920]  you know he and i took a walk i usually always have a camera with me we were we took a walk out
[03:58:06.920 --> 03:58:11.480]  into this house in the high desert in california and the light was absolutely stunning there was
[03:58:11.480 --> 03:58:15.320]  a little breeze it was one of those things where it's like hey can i do a portrait of you real quick
[03:58:15.320 --> 03:58:22.600]  dad yeah you know shot 10 frames done finished the walk processed the film stunning you know
[03:58:22.600 --> 03:58:27.000]  you caught that magic moment perfect i mean the hair blowing for me it was really the magic moment
