[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.800]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:32.000]  well we have a very important live friday broadcast lined up for you here today we
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.640]  have dr. nick baggage joining us to break down what's happening with the
[00:36.640 --> 00:42.480]  ongoing Chernobyl-like events in the Fukushima region of Japan the
[00:42.480 --> 00:47.440]  Associated Press is reporting that radiation has now reached the west
[00:47.440 --> 00:52.560]  coast where meteorologists predicted it would make landfall in los angeles
[00:52.560 --> 00:56.160]  they're whitewashing it saying that it's minuscule and culture is actually in the
[00:56.160 --> 01:01.120]  news saying that radiation is actually healthy and good for you you cannot
[01:01.120 --> 01:06.240]  make this magnitude of evil up we also have a wall street journal reporting
[01:06.240 --> 01:09.920]  low levels of radioactive material begin to be detected across the pacific
[01:09.920 --> 01:14.320]  that's when you hold a geiger counter up to the general air and it shows a
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.720]  slight increase but it that's because it's picking up from a distance the
[01:18.720 --> 01:24.800]  particles floating by it's if you ingest those you breathe those that's what
[01:24.800 --> 01:30.000]  the physicist after physicist after nuclear physicist has explained dr.
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.760]  dug rocky dr. bob bowman dr. busby yesterday that's the
[01:35.760 --> 01:41.280]  issue and that's how they cover this up until the troops that do you is not bad
[01:41.280 --> 01:45.440]  for them and we know there's four-time birth defects in the children of troops
[01:45.440 --> 01:49.760]  exposed to you 12 to 15 time increase in birth defects and cancers in the
[01:49.760 --> 01:53.040]  fallujah area that was heavily bombarded by it that's the british medical
[01:53.040 --> 01:57.680]  journal that did that study obviously we're going to be talking about libya
[01:57.680 --> 02:02.880]  as soon as the globalist backed rebels and i don't have a dog in this fight i
[02:02.880 --> 02:07.840]  don't like muhmark adafi the guy just reeks of tyranny and corruption and
[02:07.840 --> 02:12.400]  patheticness and but he's the old-fashioned king rat
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.080]  he's the old-fashioned dictator and doesn't allow abortions doesn't allow
[02:18.080 --> 02:22.000]  infanticide doesn't allow the u.n. inoculations he caught him six years
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.920]  ago injecting them with hiv that's mainstream news and so the globalist
[02:25.920 --> 02:28.480]  want him out of there and they actually want to put al-qaeda
[02:28.480 --> 02:33.520]  muslim extremists saudi backed saudi's are shipping weapons in al-qaeda works
[02:33.520 --> 02:37.280]  for the new world order it's a creation of the pentagon and then when the
[02:37.280 --> 02:40.000]  public finally figures that out they'll understand everything
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.920]  took out the secular saddam put the muslim extremist in iraq
[02:43.920 --> 02:47.440]  taking out the hussein mubarak now putting the muslim brotherhood in with
[02:47.440 --> 02:50.720]  al-baraday at the head of it in egypt this is a
[02:50.720 --> 02:55.200]  destabilization program that we reported five
[02:55.200 --> 02:59.040]  months ago with inside sources via lindsay williams and you can't
[02:59.040 --> 03:02.400]  no brag just fact you can't argue with the facts so
[03:02.400 --> 03:10.240]  we have seen the incredibly incredibly uh extreme uh or wellian
[03:10.240 --> 03:18.400]  behavior going on with the un voting 10 to 0
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.720]  with five abstentions yesterday to attack
[03:22.720 --> 03:27.200]  libya and they call it a fly zone but then in the letter it says bombardment
[03:27.200 --> 03:31.360]  and they've announced british french nato u.s cruise missile ships missile
[03:31.360 --> 03:34.800]  cruisers preparing to bombard his quote
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.800]  emplacements his military bases and she said there he may have targeted
[03:40.800 --> 03:44.080]  civilians well these are rebels who are civilians
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.240]  who were u.s backed they caught mi6 british sas there
[03:48.240 --> 03:52.240]  they admit they're pouring weapons in out of globalist controlled egypt
[03:52.240 --> 03:57.520]  and it's a little dictator fighting against the globalist takeover
[03:57.520 --> 04:03.440]  of libya and it's pure hypocrisy a thousand plus drones they
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.360]  say they kill no-name terrorist they say that they will
[04:07.360 --> 04:11.360]  kill 200 people to kill one bad guy or they'll kill anybody in afghanistan with
[04:11.360 --> 04:14.640]  a gun in their hand when it's like east texas everybody's got a gun
[04:14.640 --> 04:18.080]  and that's like oh collateral damage no big deal fighting al-qaeda but oh my
[04:18.080 --> 04:21.920]  gosh qaddafi may have strapped innocent crowds turns out that was a lie
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.960]  turns out he never ran to venezuela these are all lies is the point and it's
[04:26.960 --> 04:31.520]  incredibly hypocritical the globalist will bombard iraq afghanistan with du
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.680]  just absolute nuclear warfare and it's loving and good and our troops dying
[04:35.680 --> 04:39.520]  is loving and good from it but then he he may have fired it strapped a crowd
[04:39.520 --> 04:43.200]  and killed five people it's horrible can't believe it we gotta do something
[04:43.200 --> 04:48.480]  we're so humanitarian the left is like war war we're liberal it's humanitarian
[04:48.480 --> 04:54.160]  murder the right wing's like yes murder well the same bankers running this op
[04:54.160 --> 04:57.040]  are stealing your pension funds and getting the pentagon ready to take your
[04:57.040 --> 05:01.200]  property and knock your teeth out they hate you as much as they hate the libyans
[05:01.200 --> 05:05.520]  alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.520]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.360]  here in the united states ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[05:13.360 --> 05:18.160]  and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in february and pump prices are expected
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.640]  to reach five dollars a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced
[05:22.640 --> 05:26.880]  out of the reach of millions of americans with an expected 35 percent jump in the

[07:57.440 --> 08:09.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[08:09.680 --> 08:17.040]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:17.040 --> 08:22.080]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[08:22.080 --> 08:28.880]  ladies and gentlemen we are live it is the 18th day of march friday 2011
[08:28.880 --> 08:33.200]  you're trying to visit info wars dot com the last few days we're getting
[08:33.200 --> 08:38.960]  record traffic on top of previous records literally millions of people now
[08:38.960 --> 08:43.840]  visiting the sites per day not per week info wars dot com is basically down
[08:43.840 --> 08:47.680]  off and on prison planet dot com is the auxiliary
[08:47.680 --> 08:52.800]  attack cruiser in the info war it is there and it is up
[08:52.800 --> 08:56.880]  we are trying to work around all of this but
[08:56.880 --> 09:01.760]  we have big interactive websites i get emails and get calls and people say
[09:01.760 --> 09:04.400]  sometimes the comments don't work for hours
[09:04.400 --> 09:08.640]  yeah in emergencies we have to turn the comments off and sometimes that allows
[09:08.640 --> 09:12.080]  the site to go back up it's not a conspiracy that sometimes
[09:12.080 --> 09:15.920]  comments are turned off the comments have been turned off often on the last
[09:15.920 --> 09:19.040]  week because i make the executive decision they go
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.120]  well we can't keep it up if the comments are on turn them off in fact
[09:23.120 --> 09:26.400]  turn them both off turn them off on info wars and prison planet for now
[09:26.400 --> 09:30.000]  it's key to get the sites up with the news about the radiation reaching the
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.240]  united states with the attack on libya in the
[09:34.240 --> 09:39.440]  offing right now with all of the other insane economic
[09:39.440 --> 09:43.200]  news that we have here in front of us today
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.080]  continuing here ladies and gentlemen with some other huge news we're going to
[09:48.080 --> 09:50.720]  be going over after we cover the radiation
[09:50.720 --> 09:55.360]  after we cover the latest developments where their mainstream news is now
[09:55.360 --> 09:57.520]  saying it may just completely go chair noble
[09:57.520 --> 10:00.880]  and they may give up all hope we hope that that's not the case
[10:00.880 --> 10:05.360]  we've also got the situation in tripple benghazi there in libya
[10:05.360 --> 10:08.400]  huge developments there they now call no fly zones
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.120]  means full out bombardment and war in your face it's humanitarian yes of
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.120]  course it is continuing new york fed confirms
[10:17.120 --> 10:21.360]  intervention and currency markets this has been a secret for decades
[10:21.360 --> 10:24.800]  with their manipulation now mainstream news also
[10:24.800 --> 10:29.280]  london telegraph freaking out us treasury tim geithner shot global
[10:29.280 --> 10:33.280]  markets by revealing that washington is quite open to chinese
[10:33.280 --> 10:38.160]  proposals for the gradual development of a global reserve currency run by the
[10:38.160 --> 10:40.880]  international monetary fund that was out two years ago
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.200]  there's new there's fresh reports out today
[10:45.200 --> 10:51.520]  dealing with this whole situation also mayor of a japanese town says
[10:51.520 --> 10:55.520]  that they've been betrayed near the nuclear plant claims as people have
[10:55.520 --> 10:59.840]  been abandoned many of the local county
[10:59.840 --> 11:02.800]  prefectures in that area reporting up to 150 times
[11:02.800 --> 11:09.600]  safe levels of radiation so that is just some of what we're going to be
[11:09.600 --> 11:13.280]  breaking down here today meanwhile obama
[11:13.280 --> 11:17.360]  spent the last two days off and on doing nca
[11:17.360 --> 11:22.000]  apex visiting with hockey teams and and and professional basketball teams
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.880]  he finally made a brief statement about how
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.120]  the u.s wants to help japan even though the u.s trips have been pulled out the
[11:29.120 --> 11:32.160]  fleet's been sent away because the radiation going out to sea
[11:32.160 --> 11:36.480]  towards the west coast he gave a brief statement finally last night six days
[11:36.480 --> 11:40.800]  in we're now seven days in now remember the low level
[11:40.800 --> 11:44.640]  radiation if you believe the un and the associated press
[11:44.640 --> 11:47.600]  that's where they're getting their information un detectors we're not
[11:47.600 --> 11:50.080]  getting that from the u.s government on the west coast
[11:50.080 --> 11:56.880]  but un detectors are reporting uh low levels of radiation what they call
[11:56.880 --> 12:00.880]  miniscule fallout now remember as we've been saying
[12:00.880 --> 12:03.840]  for now seven days when the radiation gets here
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.520]  it's only from the first leak on friday takes on average seven days across
[12:07.520 --> 12:11.440]  the pacific on average and it has reached with the prediction of seven
[12:11.440 --> 12:14.640]  days that meteorologists predicted last saturday
[12:14.640 --> 12:17.840]  and uh we of course put out one of the first big reports on that picked up by
[12:17.840 --> 12:23.360]  dredge report on saturday and sunday so the lower level leaks from the
[12:23.360 --> 12:26.240]  initial tsunami and earthquake and some of the
[12:26.240 --> 12:30.480]  off-gassing that's what's now first reaching united states then you have the
[12:30.480 --> 12:34.640]  explosion on saturday at fukushima one the devastating mega explosion of
[12:34.640 --> 12:38.800]  fukushima three mark one mox reactor on monday
[12:38.800 --> 12:42.560]  other reactors tuesday wednesday thursday blowing up and and setting on
[12:42.560 --> 12:49.360]  fire and off-gassing uh so we have all of that uh unfolding
[12:49.360 --> 12:54.320]  right now we have all of that unfolding and that radiation then is set
[12:54.320 --> 12:59.920]  to intensify saturday sunday monday tuesday wednesday and thursday
[12:59.920 --> 13:03.920]  right through to next week and we need independent universities independent
[13:03.920 --> 13:08.320]  organizations independent individuals to be testing for that radiation
[13:08.320 --> 13:12.640]  remember as dr bob bowman said as dr busby said
[13:12.640 --> 13:16.560]  uh and as dr rocky has said in previous interviews
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.960]  even a doubling of radiation that they say is safe or a tripling or quadrupling
[13:20.960 --> 13:23.520]  they're claiming 10 times the radiation is safe
[13:23.520 --> 13:28.320]  remember that's background radiation not actual particles that are getting up
[13:28.320 --> 13:32.080]  near the geiger counter that randomly come in and that you breathe
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.400]  that's the big killer but it takes years if not decades to kill you
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.160]  in fact here's new scientist from all the way back in 2002
[13:40.160 --> 13:47.280]  headline nuclear test fallout killed thousands in the united states
[13:47.280 --> 13:50.720]  nuclear test fallout killed thousands in
[13:50.720 --> 13:56.240]  the united states and it goes over uh the number of cancers and deaths
[13:56.240 --> 14:00.320]  directly connected to the cancers now the un
[14:00.320 --> 14:03.840]  the new york times and the atomic energy agency predict
[14:03.840 --> 14:07.280]  estimate one million have died in 25 years
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.120]  and cancers leukemias and other illnesses directly connected
[14:11.120 --> 14:14.800]  to the chernobyl event which right now looks like it's smaller
[14:14.800 --> 14:18.800]  than what we've seen unfold so you cannot trust the system
[14:18.800 --> 14:24.560]  with their history of making up uh information about fallout whitewashing
[14:24.560 --> 14:27.520]  it to tell you the truth in fact and culture
[14:27.520 --> 14:30.960]  is now in human events today with a devastatingly
[14:30.960 --> 14:35.200]  discrediting statement a glowing report on radiation and culture
[14:35.200 --> 14:38.560]  with a terrible earthquake and the resulting tsunami that have devastated
[14:38.560 --> 14:41.520]  japan the only good news is that anyone exposed to
[14:41.520 --> 14:45.680]  excess radiation from the nuclear power plant is now probably much
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.600]  less likely to get cancer and then she goes on
[14:49.600 --> 14:55.360]  with just bizarre statements uh so now plutonium uranium
[14:55.360 --> 15:01.520]  strontium tritium cesium and radioactive iodine all in thousands of
[15:01.520 --> 15:05.200]  studies to absolutely confirm massive increases in
[15:05.200 --> 15:08.880]  cancer when you're exposed to even moderate levels
[15:08.880 --> 15:13.600]  she is telling you it's good for you i could play
[15:13.600 --> 15:18.400]  cbs news i've played it hundreds of times i in fact let's queue it up
[15:18.400 --> 15:22.160]  mercury is good for you it's good for children's behavior
[15:22.160 --> 15:26.320]  but that's a lawyer talk because they want you servile brain damaged
[15:26.320 --> 15:29.120]  not thinking and so they see that as good behavior
[15:29.120 --> 15:32.560]  so in their weird world it does improve cognitive brain function
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.200]  by lowering iqs we've spent decades exposing the sodium fluoride seven
[15:37.200 --> 15:41.200]  fold increase in men and bone cancer three fold increase in women
[15:41.200 --> 15:45.200]  it hits men a lot worse women physiologically are tougher any doctor
[15:45.200 --> 15:49.360]  will tell you that um it really hits boys even worse
[15:49.360 --> 15:52.000]  generally averaging boys and men together at seven times
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  it's more than 14 times 12 and under boys

[16:01.120 --> 16:03.360]  their blood brain barrier isn't developed properly
[16:03.360 --> 16:07.600]  goes directly into the brain now the epa and fda have recommended it not be
[16:07.600 --> 16:11.760]  used as pesticide anymore because it's bio accumulating in the crops
[16:11.760 --> 16:15.520]  now they've recommended it be cut from 1.2 part per million
[16:15.520 --> 16:23.040]  to uh half or 0.7 part per million you see we're winning the fight
[16:23.040 --> 16:27.440]  sodium fluorides poison mercury is poison
[16:27.440 --> 16:32.080]  lead is poison asbestos is poisonous and carcinogenic
[16:32.080 --> 16:35.840]  remember they said the air is safe to breathe
[16:35.840 --> 16:41.520]  and the cdc has now had to admit uh the may the mayo clinic has come out they've
[16:41.520 --> 16:48.560]  done chest scans of the victims uh of 9 11 the asbestos and and all the
[16:48.560 --> 16:52.480]  rest of the toxins massive increases in cancer
[16:52.480 --> 16:56.640]  massive increases in death rates that is confirmed and then it came out years
[16:56.640 --> 16:59.760]  later that christina todd wittman went to bush and said we've got to keep us
[16:59.760 --> 17:03.440]  evacuated for weeks it's deadly our detectors it's deadly
[17:03.440 --> 17:07.280]  and and and they were told no say it's safe to breathe
[17:07.280 --> 17:10.720]  no mask are needed because if they admit you need a mask
[17:10.720 --> 17:13.760]  they've got to admit it's not safe for people in the area
[17:13.760 --> 17:17.520]  so that's why obama came out in the news today in an

[24:56.560 --> 24:59.120]  haven't including for xm because we have been
[24:59.120 --> 25:02.960]  absolutely hammered with this radio
[25:02.960 --> 25:08.480]  active situation that is unfolding and again the first radiation from just the
[25:08.480 --> 25:12.000]  leaks on friday has reached the west coast
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.320]  we're going to be breaking all of that news down in detail with a leading
[25:16.320 --> 25:25.440]  radiation expert who has been featured by cnn fox the new york times
[25:25.440 --> 25:28.640]  you name it we're going to be talking to shane connor
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.360]  coming up he's the biggest supplier to the military of geiger counters
[25:33.360 --> 25:36.880]  and other systems he's going to be breaking down
[25:36.880 --> 25:40.960]  what he's seeing from here in texas coming up
[25:40.960 --> 25:47.200]  in the next segment but but right now i and dr nick beggars is joining us bob
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.840]  chapman is joining us right now i want to shift gears
[25:51.840 --> 25:55.600]  into the libya situation as the rebels
[25:55.600 --> 26:00.240]  began to be routed the openly funded by the saudi arabians al qaeda
[26:00.240 --> 26:02.800]  that's qaddafi's actually telling the truth on that he's not a good guy but
[26:02.800 --> 26:08.160]  compared to them he's a lesser of two evils of two evils
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.400]  and when they thought they could defeat him with just the ground forces and the
[26:12.400 --> 26:14.880]  weapons pouring in from globalist controlled egypt
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.160]  and saudi arabia they were acting like they weren't involved in it the minute
[26:18.160 --> 26:21.920]  he began to take all the cities back the rebels only have three cities left
[26:21.920 --> 26:25.040]  he's taken back scores of towns and cities from them
[26:25.040 --> 26:28.000]  and the minute he started to roll into Benghazi
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  was when they passed a no fly resolution
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.840]  which ron paul's pointed out is unconstitutional it's an act of war
[26:35.840 --> 26:40.240]  it violates the un charter we have all that detailed at info wars dot com
[26:40.240 --> 26:44.640]  and prison planet dot com and they're trying to put an even more radical
[26:44.640 --> 26:47.440]  extreme group of people in there remember qaddafi
[26:47.440 --> 26:51.920]  six years ago made a deal with the west but they want the trillions and trillions
[26:51.920 --> 26:54.640]  of dollars of oil the most oil rich country
[26:54.640 --> 26:58.960]  in africa and a guy who's given leadership to africa outside of globalist
[26:58.960 --> 27:01.680]  control he's spoken out against the vaccines
[27:01.680 --> 27:05.440]  sterilizing people that they've caught being filled with hiv as well
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.120]  he uh he is a real socialist a horrible
[27:09.120 --> 27:12.240]  corrupt kingpin but he actually serves out goodies
[27:12.240 --> 27:16.480]  and to the public he's developed and modernized libya
[27:16.480 --> 27:20.880]  and in the no fly double speak double think or wellville
[27:20.880 --> 27:25.120]  they state including bombardments and they've announced the french
[27:25.120 --> 27:30.000]  the british nato u.s missile cruiser ships with cruise missiles
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.720]  are preparing they said as early as this morning but
[27:32.720 --> 27:37.520]  last time i checked a bombardment hadn't begun uh to begin attacking
[27:37.520 --> 27:41.840]  muammar qaddafi's military bases and in placements
[27:41.840 --> 27:47.040]  and the media's hyping 25 dead bombardment of qaddafi forces
[27:47.040 --> 27:52.640]  uh so that is just some of the news and information so
[27:52.640 --> 27:55.840]  you've got these rebels that they're calling protesters attacking military
[27:55.840 --> 28:00.080]  bases killing military killing police whether you're for them or against them
[28:00.080 --> 28:03.680]  the point is they're a military operation and when qaddafi
[28:03.680 --> 28:07.040]  targets them the media lies and says he's targeted civilians turned out that
[28:07.040 --> 28:10.640]  wasn't true three weeks ago turns out a month ago he didn't flee
[28:10.640 --> 28:14.160]  as the british foreign ministry said to venezuela
[28:14.160 --> 28:18.240]  turned out he hadn't stepped down they keep saying he fled then no he stepped
[28:18.240 --> 28:22.640]  down no he's running to zimbabwe to bolster the forces
[28:22.640 --> 28:25.920]  and so as soon as he was about to one of the last big city they held
[28:25.920 --> 28:29.840]  a few other little towns in the east the media
[28:29.840 --> 28:33.840]  comes out and the un comes out and says
[28:33.840 --> 28:38.640]  10 to 0 we're voting for no fly to help humanitarian population
[28:38.640 --> 28:41.360]  and they will bomb their water treatment plants
[28:41.360 --> 28:45.040]  in their humanitarian effort they always do in syria iraq
[28:45.040 --> 28:48.320]  you name it they will bomb the government buildings they will bomb the
[28:48.320 --> 28:51.440]  military bases they will bomb all the airfields both
[28:51.440 --> 28:55.120]  military and civilian they will bomb the country end to end
[28:55.120 --> 28:58.800]  as they're gearing up to do but as of this minute they have not attacked
[28:58.800 --> 29:03.120]  because muhmer qaddafi the slimy slick dictator
[29:03.120 --> 29:08.800]  of 40 years is a survivor and he's a military man and he's certainly not
[29:08.800 --> 29:12.640]  stupid and he said okay i love the ceasefire
[29:12.640 --> 29:16.960]  now your western back forces cannot attack me
[29:16.960 --> 29:21.200]  and he's engaged in a ceasefire he says great i want to ceasefire you attacked
[29:21.200 --> 29:27.120]  me you're bringing weapons in from the east out of
[29:27.120 --> 29:31.520]  egypt that borders them to the east out of saudi arabia
[29:31.520 --> 29:35.440]  this is al qaeda attacking me which is actually true that's al qaeda means cia
[29:35.440 --> 29:40.080]  brigade in the cia database that's been out since the 80s
[29:40.080 --> 29:44.240]  and so now uh there's some jockeying i believe we're going to go ahead and
[29:44.240 --> 29:47.200]  still start bombing him the un has signaled that
[29:47.200 --> 29:50.560]  so now a whole new war on top of all the other bedlam
[29:50.560 --> 29:54.400]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:54.400 --> 29:59.360]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:59.360 --> 30:05.520]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[30:05.520 --> 30:09.760]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[30:09.760 --> 30:12.720]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[30:12.720 --> 30:15.920]  americans at home i have a tremendous influence
[30:15.920 --> 30:19.920]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[30:19.920 --> 30:25.200]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[30:25.200 --> 30:29.360]  the fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off
[30:29.360 --> 30:32.800]  short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[30:32.800 --> 30:35.200]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[30:35.200 --> 30:39.120]  sam geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[30:39.120 --> 30:42.480]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[30:42.480 --> 30:46.000]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[30:46.000 --> 30:51.200]  we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on
[30:51.200 --> 30:55.600]  dvd at info wars dot com or watch it online right now
[30:55.600 --> 31:00.000]  in super high quality at prison planet dot tv
[31:00.000 --> 31:03.200]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[31:03.200 --> 31:07.200]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[31:07.200 --> 31:10.960]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[31:10.960 --> 31:14.560]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[31:14.560 --> 31:18.800]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[31:18.800 --> 31:22.000]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.640]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[31:24.640 --> 31:28.560]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[31:28.560 --> 31:32.160]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[31:32.160 --> 31:35.200]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[31:35.200 --> 31:37.920]  onages number five a solar power generator
[31:37.920 --> 31:41.600]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[31:41.600 --> 31:44.960]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old
[31:44.960 --> 31:50.000]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[32:24.800 --> 32:28.320]  and america's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact
[32:28.320 --> 32:32.720]  barons called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you

[33:12.160 --> 33:23.280]  it's alex jones
[33:23.280 --> 33:31.120]  Monday through friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. thank you for joining us dr.
[33:31.120 --> 33:35.040]  nick baggages joining us the next hour then bob Chapman on the economy
[33:35.040 --> 33:38.160]  on the open announcement that the federal reserve has been manipulating
[33:38.160 --> 33:42.640]  currency markets worldwide but i'm going to be breaking
[33:42.640 --> 33:48.800]  down here on air for everyone the latest developments at the fukushima
[33:48.800 --> 33:55.360]  Chernobyl style disaster in japan ap reporting fallout has reached the
[33:55.360 --> 33:59.040]  western coast arriving in los angeles reuters headline
[33:59.040 --> 34:03.760]  very low radiation detected on west coast remember that's the first
[34:03.760 --> 34:09.040]  radiation from last friday when they just had
[34:09.040 --> 34:14.320]  a basic leak at the facility not the explosion at fukushima reactor one on
[34:14.320 --> 34:17.120]  saturday the giant mushroom cloud explosion
[34:17.120 --> 34:21.920]  on monday at fukushima max mark one plutonium-based
[34:21.920 --> 34:26.320]  and uranium-based reactor the 600 000 plus spent fuel rods
[34:26.320 --> 34:29.280]  that ap and reuters confirm are there many of which were stored
[34:29.280 --> 34:33.600]  on top of the facilities that blue sky high we know the japanese are not
[34:33.600 --> 34:36.480]  releasing in those two two counties two states
[34:36.480 --> 34:39.840]  our prefectures right around fukushima the numbers
[34:39.840 --> 34:44.320]  local governments are reporting 150 times safe levels now he's very busy he's
[34:44.320 --> 34:47.600]  not been doing radio interviews but i've known him for 12 years first
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.480]  interviewed him more than a decade ago we were able to get shane connor
[34:52.480 --> 34:56.160]  who supplies the potassium iodide pills to the military
[34:56.160 --> 34:59.600]  who supplies it to the government who supplies it to fema
[34:59.600 --> 35:03.760]  he's the biggest holder of geiger counters
[35:03.760 --> 35:10.880]  and has the biggest lab that basically sets them and calibrates them he also
[35:10.880 --> 35:17.360]  again is the biggest manufacturer of the potassium iodide the pills are all
[35:17.360 --> 35:23.920]  gone but he has the raw base potassium iodine material
[35:23.920 --> 35:30.880]  that's enough for 20 adults 200 well we're going to have him break it all
[35:30.880 --> 35:34.320]  down and the fact that you'll want to talk to your physician
[35:34.320 --> 35:37.680]  first you'll of course the radiation levels would have had to go up first
[35:37.680 --> 35:40.640]  he's got a whole fact sheet we've got it at info wars
[35:40.640 --> 35:44.560]  dot com he is completely sold out even to his distributors
[35:44.560 --> 35:48.400]  my guys bought most of it yesterday that sold out overnight
[35:48.400 --> 35:50.800]  they got back there this morning they're coming back
[35:50.800 --> 35:54.400]  with the rest of it he has basically completely
[35:54.400 --> 35:57.440]  sold out of it the last remaining supplies
[35:57.440 --> 36:03.280]  right now at info wars dot com and we are limiting how many each person can
[36:03.280 --> 36:06.880]  get some more people can get ahold of it this all started
[36:06.880 --> 36:11.600]  because the pills i bought a decade ago were expired and
[36:11.600 --> 36:14.880]  i began to for the rest of the crew look around for it
[36:14.880 --> 36:18.080]  and hiding in plain view i'm like wait a minute shane connor
[36:18.080 --> 36:22.080]  he's he's the huge guy with nuclear he's the guy that you know makes
[36:22.080 --> 36:25.760]  a little geiger counter detectors and and recalibrates the government ones
[36:25.760 --> 36:29.760]  let's call him and of course it turned out he was one of the only suppliers
[36:29.760 --> 36:33.680]  left in the country with it and we've now gotten the remaining
[36:33.680 --> 36:36.880]  of his stock available now we're going to be shipping it out
[36:36.880 --> 36:40.640]  as quickly as possible at info wars dot com now understand something
[36:40.640 --> 36:44.160]  in three hours last night what we bought yesterday sold overnight
[36:44.160 --> 36:48.480]  this will probably sell out by the end of the day and then this is it
[36:48.480 --> 36:52.240]  this is all we've got but but but i want to explain this
[36:52.240 --> 36:56.320]  and the fact sheet he's got and have him break it down the headline up on info
[36:56.320 --> 37:00.240]  wars dot com the link to the online video bookstore shopping cart that has it
[37:00.240 --> 37:03.520]  info wars as some of the only potassium iodine
[37:03.520 --> 37:06.800]  in the united states now sir you're the expert on this
[37:06.800 --> 37:10.560]  decades involved in this breakdown exactly
[37:10.560 --> 37:14.160]  what this product is what it does for people that are out there
[37:14.160 --> 37:17.840]  oh and let me just add for those that don't know you've been featured in the
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.680]  boston globe newsmax world net daily national defense mag
[37:21.680 --> 37:25.920]  bulletin of atomic scientist washington post new york times usa today
[37:25.920 --> 37:30.960]  san francisco chronicle wall street journal cnn newsday
[37:30.960 --> 37:34.800]  glenn beck the list goes on and on i mean you are a preeminent expert
[37:34.800 --> 37:38.080]  that we've got here and thank god you were hiding in plain view just south of
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.240]  us in gonzalez texas break down exactly what this
[37:42.240 --> 37:46.640]  product is for folks that are out there elix thanks for having me on and thanks
[37:46.640 --> 37:49.760]  for getting these products out uh they're not going to do anybody any good
[37:49.760 --> 37:52.960]  in my warehouse when people need them in their home
[37:52.960 --> 37:59.440]  the uh for any radiological event uh whether it's a nuclear bomb or what
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.680]  we're seeing going on in japan here the greatest threat the further you get
[38:03.680 --> 38:06.960]  downwind is always radioactive iodine health
[38:06.960 --> 38:11.120]  physicists always agree that's the problem that was the problem at
[38:11.120 --> 38:14.400]  noble the further you got away from ground zero
[38:14.400 --> 38:18.160]  the casualties almost exclusively have been from
[38:18.160 --> 38:22.240]  radioactive iodine causing damage to your thyroid gland
[38:22.240 --> 38:25.840]  what potassium iodide does and the and the fda is
[38:25.840 --> 38:29.520]  recognized this and endorsed it for literally
[38:29.520 --> 38:35.440]  50 to 60 years now is that when you take that before you're exposed and you
[38:35.440 --> 38:38.800]  could possibly ingest or inhale radioactive iodine
[38:38.800 --> 38:42.480]  if you could take potassium iodide beforehand
[38:42.480 --> 38:46.000]  you will saturate and fill up your thyroid gland with safe
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.880]  stable iodine now and you can take it as little as a half hour before it
[38:50.880 --> 38:53.360]  arrives but you're playing beat the clock
[38:53.360 --> 38:56.960]  whatever gets to your thyroid gland first stays there
[38:56.960 --> 39:00.320]  and if you have safe stable iodine in place
[39:00.320 --> 39:04.800]  then the radioactive iodine if you later inhale or ingested in contaminated
[39:04.800 --> 39:08.240]  milk or other products your kidneys simply eliminate it
[39:08.240 --> 39:11.360]  it gives you almost a hundred percent perfection
[39:11.360 --> 39:15.200]  against thyroid cancer and all these other problems and we document on our
[39:15.200 --> 39:18.320]  website from our own nuclear weapons testing
[39:18.320 --> 39:24.000]  of the number of thyroid cancers that we had in this country right up close
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.920]  with that in fact the national cancer institute study
[39:27.920 --> 39:33.520]  estimating thyroid doses of i-131 received by Americans from Nevada
[39:33.520 --> 39:38.960]  atmospheric nuclear bomb tests they say it likely generated from 10,000 to
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.680]  75,000 cases of thyroid cancer and we also saw
[39:43.680 --> 39:47.040]  and we show it on our website where a Chinese
[39:47.040 --> 39:51.200]  test done back in let me get back straight for you
[39:51.200 --> 39:57.440]  done back in December 28th 1966 resulted in a fallout cloud covering most
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.440]  of the United States about four days later
[40:01.440 --> 40:05.600]  and we had it showing up in in milk across the country
[40:05.600 --> 40:10.800]  now those levels were that showed up from that test
[40:10.800 --> 40:14.160]  they were not enough that you would have pulled the milk
[40:14.160 --> 40:18.000]  but they it shows that it will cover the complete country
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.160]  Chernobyl we had it showing up in milk from
[40:22.160 --> 40:26.720]  cows in Washington the state of Washington from the pastures
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.960]  where normally they would have two to four pipal curies
[40:30.960 --> 40:34.720]  in the milk naturally of radioactive iodine
[40:34.720 --> 40:38.800]  they were having elevated levels over 400 now
[40:38.800 --> 40:42.880]  it's important to get educated when we start hearing people talking about these
[40:42.880 --> 40:46.800]  huge increases they still wouldn't have pulled the milk
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.120]  until it got 10 times higher than that so people
[40:51.120 --> 40:55.360]  people need to get educated about this so that they don't panic
[40:55.360 --> 40:59.600]  but we we risk here without the education
[40:59.600 --> 41:03.920]  that we could ask the panic could be actually more widespread
[41:03.920 --> 41:07.360]  than the fallout itself okay well let's break that down but i want to just give
[41:07.360 --> 41:10.960]  people the latest headline radiation drives back crews
[41:10.960 --> 41:15.200]  attempting to rain in reactor AP Reuters are all reporting that
[41:15.200 --> 41:18.560]  there's obviously been a lot of radiation already released 600 000
[41:18.560 --> 41:22.000]  rods blown in all directions caught on fire spent rods
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.720]  two of the six reactors internal containment has been breached as of
[41:26.720 --> 41:30.800]  tuesday uh you know three four days ago uh but
[41:30.800 --> 41:34.320]  now they're talking more and more about giving up hope
[41:34.320 --> 41:38.400]  if those reactors fully melt down uh i've i've had
[41:38.400 --> 41:42.400]  nuclear physicists on just yesterday they said they could actually explode
[41:42.400 --> 41:47.440]  like we saw in the 50s uh in russia
[41:47.440 --> 41:51.760]  yeah this um but my if we have an event
[41:51.760 --> 41:58.160]  and and and it's stopped uh you know we can deal with that my concern is if we
[41:58.160 --> 42:02.320]  get if we get these meltdowns going where we've got a continual
[42:02.320 --> 42:07.120]  radioactive volcano essentially spewing this stuff out continually
[42:07.120 --> 42:10.960]  then we've got some major major serious problems here because it's never
[42:10.960 --> 42:14.240]  going to quit it's not going to be a a Chernobyl that
[42:14.240 --> 42:19.360]  that uh everybody was able to take ki and they had no thyroid cancer and then
[42:19.360 --> 42:22.720]  it blew out of the area it went around the world and that was it
[42:22.720 --> 42:26.640]  my my concern watching and that's what i've always thought would happen with
[42:26.640 --> 42:30.400]  this japanese thing but as the days went on every eight hours they were
[42:30.400 --> 42:35.360]  losing another reactor so all all bets are off on this
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.600]  episode what's going on i i am absolutely and just to be clear
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.440]  uh for people and i want to go over the facts with you because you're the
[42:43.440 --> 42:47.440]  expert again you know you've developed the pills made the pills when the biggest
[42:47.440 --> 42:51.200]  sellers of the government your nuclear to the pentagon homeland security i mean
[42:51.200 --> 42:55.840]  you're the big dog explain to us what this product is folks
[42:55.840 --> 42:58.640]  when they get it at info wars dot com they need to consult
[42:58.640 --> 43:01.840]  their physician or healthcare provider all the fact sheets
[43:01.840 --> 43:05.680]  or on info wars dot com on the shopping cart this is it
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.360]  uh in fact when i talked to you this morning as as tim arrived to to to make
[43:09.360 --> 43:13.840]  the final purchase you told me that we were purchasing the last of it
[43:13.840 --> 43:17.440]  that all the rest of it was going out to some of your other wholesalers so and
[43:17.440 --> 43:20.720]  by the way these are selling for more than a hundred and fifty dollars many
[43:20.720 --> 43:25.120]  places i've agreed with you uh to uh only sell it for
[43:25.120 --> 43:28.640]  forty dollars uh many other people are selling it for a
[43:28.640 --> 43:32.560]  lot more which i think is uh not a very nice thing to do
[43:32.560 --> 43:37.680]  so i i i totally agree with you there's no there's no tablets to be had uh
[43:37.680 --> 43:42.080]  we're the national distributor of one of the three major ones
[43:42.080 --> 43:45.840]  and uh we're we're not going to be the government stepped in they take all of
[43:45.840 --> 43:49.680]  the uh manufacturer we may be three to six months
[43:49.680 --> 43:53.360]  before we get supplies the government when my guys were there yesterday they
[43:53.360 --> 43:56.640]  were japanese they're buying it for japan the u.s i don't know if you can talk
[43:56.640 --> 43:59.760]  about but the u.s government had just stepped in and actually bought most of
[43:59.760 --> 44:03.360]  what you had the nuke strips uh i mean uh
[44:03.360 --> 44:07.040]  we've got confirmed reports they're telling medical play uh facilities to
[44:07.040 --> 44:13.440]  hoard the potassium iodine tablets yeah what what i did is i i took uh
[44:13.440 --> 44:19.360]  last fall i went ahead and uh had uh one ton
[44:19.360 --> 44:25.520]  one one hundred pound drum uh the fmi died usp it's what we've made tablets
[44:25.520 --> 44:28.960]  with in the past when we were making tablets ourselves
[44:28.960 --> 44:33.520]  this is the exact same thing that's in the tablets this is the active ingredient
[44:33.520 --> 44:37.520]  and we took uh one ton literal one ton of it
[44:37.520 --> 44:43.840]  and we made 32 000 vials of which you alec have the last of it at this point
[44:43.840 --> 44:48.160]  and uh and i'm thrilled that you came on forward with this because
[44:48.160 --> 44:51.520]  we got so swamped we had to shut down our phone
[44:51.520 --> 44:56.160]  and uh our internet taking orders online at 10 30
[44:56.160 --> 45:01.680]  monday so that we can fill those orders and uh our distributors the new alec
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.480]  are getting the stuff out there but anyways the 26 grams that you get
[45:06.480 --> 45:10.960]  is the exact amount that if you pour it into a one liter bottle of water
[45:10.960 --> 45:15.200]  shake it up you have a potassium iodide solution where every measuring
[45:15.200 --> 45:20.080]  teaspoon or five milliliters will be at one adult
[45:20.080 --> 45:23.040]  daily dose and what you're looking at is is
[45:23.040 --> 45:26.400]  typically you would take it for seven to ten days
[45:26.400 --> 45:31.520]  but let me emphasize when you get this do not start taking it now
[45:31.520 --> 45:34.560]  we we are not at that point you just need to
[45:34.560 --> 45:38.240]  have it so that because you won't be able to get it and we have a detailed fact
[45:38.240 --> 45:41.120]  sheet at info wars dot com on the shopping cart
[45:41.120 --> 45:43.920]  with it and the entire breakdown consult your physician health care
[45:43.920 --> 45:47.600]  provider follow the indications at what point would you
[45:47.600 --> 45:50.240]  because the government may lie about radiation on the west coast
[45:50.240 --> 45:54.720]  at what point uh if they report 10 times 20 times normal radiation
[45:54.720 --> 45:58.560]  when would you take this listen when chernobyl happened we didn't have the
[45:58.560 --> 46:02.000]  internet we didn't have as many they snuck up on everybody
[46:02.000 --> 46:05.760]  we have got i've got nuclear stuff all over the country i've got them in
[46:05.760 --> 46:10.560]  japan uh many many other people are up to speed on this and we've got the
[46:10.560 --> 46:13.680]  internet this thing is not going to sneak up on it
[46:13.680 --> 46:17.440]  people need to get prepared but it's not going to sneak up on us
[46:17.440 --> 46:20.880]  and uh uh the the government cannot
[46:20.880 --> 46:24.480]  not tell people to take it when it's time to take it
[46:24.480 --> 46:28.080]  because too many people are watching this and they're going to be looking at it
[46:28.080 --> 46:31.440]  independently so they they're not going to be able to hide
[46:31.440 --> 46:35.040]  or of course blow down or delay telling people to take it
[46:35.040 --> 46:39.600]  the reason they would want to delay it is because then that shows up
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.240]  they don't have any for anyone there's not enough there were never enough
[46:44.240 --> 46:47.600]  pills even manufactured that we would have enough
[46:47.600 --> 46:51.120]  well that's what you said 12 years ago when you first came on our show
[46:51.120 --> 46:54.080]  Raymond Teague a nasa scientist friend of mine
[46:54.080 --> 46:58.240]  electrical engineer worked on the Apollo missions he was always very concerned
[46:58.240 --> 47:02.160]  about this and and and you know uh introduce me to you
[47:02.160 --> 47:05.360]  years ago concerned just about nuclear power plants
[47:05.360 --> 47:10.240]  and if they ever had a meltdown that everybody in the surrounding area uh
[47:10.240 --> 47:14.800]  have this any other points you need to make specifically
[47:14.800 --> 47:22.160]  about this uh potassium iodide both go to my website and read the ill wins
[47:22.160 --> 47:27.680]  article when ill wins blow from afar this will make you if you read this you
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.280]  will be the resident joe expert in your county
[47:31.280 --> 47:35.600]  for all that we're dealing with here we don't have the product available to
[47:35.600 --> 47:39.280]  sell directly from our website get that from alex
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.280]  but you can get the information when an ill wind blows from afar
[47:43.280 --> 47:47.200]  at ki4u.com do you want us to mirror uh
[47:47.200 --> 47:50.400]  mr connor that article at infoworks.com please
[47:50.400 --> 47:53.680]  please okay when an ill wind blows from afar
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.840]  on their site can we also go to nuclear.com to find that uh no
[47:57.840 --> 48:03.200]  no just go to uh ki4u.com and it'll be on the main page it's a
[48:03.200 --> 48:07.680]  prominent link right on the first screen okay so when an ill wind blows
[48:07.680 --> 48:12.000]  when an ill wind blows we'll get that up right now uh on info wars.com
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.400]  so fantastic and now again people need to print off the two-sided pdf that we
[48:16.400 --> 48:19.760]  have written up by you the expert again
[48:19.760 --> 48:23.120]  still consult your physician or healthcare provider don't
[48:23.120 --> 48:27.040]  start taking this this is an emergency backup and when i was reading
[48:27.040 --> 48:30.960]  the pills only last a few years but uh you were telling me shane
[48:30.960 --> 48:34.640]  that that this stuff basically is indefinite because it's in the raw
[48:34.640 --> 48:38.960]  chemical form yes this this is the raw potassium iodide if
[48:38.960 --> 48:43.760]  keep it dry and you don't get it too hot uh potassium iodide is the same thing
[48:43.760 --> 48:47.520]  that's in your iodide salt if you look at the ingredients on the side of your
[48:47.520 --> 48:51.040]  salt shaker and like salt if you don't get it wet and you don't
[48:51.040 --> 48:55.200]  now fit it left darn near forever are the japanese right and the chinese
[48:55.200 --> 48:59.200]  rushing to buy iodine salt as the la times reports or will that do
[48:59.200 --> 49:02.720]  nothing for them well let me just tell you about
[49:02.720 --> 49:07.600]  iodized salt for instance the little micrograms that are in there are good
[49:07.600 --> 49:11.200]  for nutritional reasons but you would have to you would have to eat
[49:11.200 --> 49:16.800]  five cups of salt a day to get the same amount of k i as you do out of out of
[49:16.800 --> 49:20.560]  either the tablet dose or and that would kill me and that would kill you
[49:20.560 --> 49:24.480]  oh that would you know now there's a lot of nutritional
[49:24.480 --> 49:28.880]  products out there that do have some iodine it's good for nutritional reasons
[49:28.880 --> 49:32.800]  but you need to end up with and we're talking at all the 130
[49:32.800 --> 49:38.800]  130 milligrams per day okay briefly how many people
[49:38.800 --> 49:43.520]  how many adults will one of these vials one of these containers a potassium
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.280]  iodide usp 26 grams how many people will this take care of
[49:47.280 --> 49:51.520]  for seven days to fill the thyroid it's got 200
[49:51.520 --> 49:58.560]  200 adult daily doses or at least 400 child doses and depending on how young
[49:58.560 --> 50:03.520]  the children are potentially six or 800 children if they're very small
[50:03.520 --> 50:07.200]  and the dosing instructions are are right on there by the way
[50:07.200 --> 50:12.720]  when we get in short supply it's always pregnant women and children first
[50:12.720 --> 50:17.040]  that you would want to be want to protect they are the most vulnerable
[50:17.040 --> 50:21.120]  as you and i get much over the age of 40 the odds of the cancer are fully
[50:21.120 --> 50:24.720]  expressing itself in our remaining lifetime begins to drop off
[50:24.720 --> 50:28.320]  the children are the ones most at risk it ravages them
[50:28.320 --> 50:31.600]  very quickly many times within the year after exposure
[50:31.600 --> 50:34.480]  all right this won't last long the servers are shutting down on the

[50:49.280 --> 50:52.320]  around very very quickly we are limiting how many

[54:08.480 --> 54:11.360]  who supplies the u.s government is our guest for another five minutes
[54:11.360 --> 54:14.720]  he gave us some good news uh in his article
[54:14.720 --> 54:18.720]  when a ill will when an ill wind blows from afar
[54:18.720 --> 54:21.760]  we're going to post it at info wars dot com right now we'll also put it on
[54:21.760 --> 54:25.600]  screen for prison planet dot tv viewers uh if you
[54:25.600 --> 54:30.160]  you it will obviously sell out very quickly the potassium iodide usp
[54:30.160 --> 54:34.560]  that can do uh you know 20 adults or more uh conservatively correct me if i'm
[54:34.560 --> 54:38.160]  wrong shane that there is still regular iodine still
[54:38.160 --> 54:42.000]  condol still consult your physician but that would be topical
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.240]  explain that to people shane the good news regular iodine on the skin
[54:46.240 --> 54:50.720]  explain it yes it's a very very important thing to
[54:50.720 --> 54:53.760]  get across here and emphasize over and over again
[54:53.760 --> 54:58.000]  is that word now we're talking about uh actual iodine
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.840]  products and we're not talking about ingesting them
[55:01.840 --> 55:05.360]  drinking them or swallowing them i'm talking about for instance
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.360]  tincture of iodine now what you do not drink that
[55:09.360 --> 55:12.720]  and make sure that people understand if you start telling them about this but
[55:12.720 --> 55:16.800]  if you take tincture of iodine like two percent
[55:16.800 --> 55:20.880]  putting that on your skin and we we show in this article that you're posting
[55:20.880 --> 55:24.000]  alex how much per two percent tincture of iodine
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.240]  if you put that like eight milliliters for an adult
[55:28.240 --> 55:32.960]  on your abdomen or forearm each day uh you will get a
[55:32.960 --> 55:38.560]  thyroid protecting dose darn near as good as the tablet now it's not a
[55:38.560 --> 55:42.960]  specific dosing because it evaporates different depending on the
[55:42.960 --> 55:48.080]  the the humidity at the time people absorb differently through their skin
[55:48.080 --> 55:51.200]  rubbing it off et cetera but for most people and
[55:51.200 --> 55:54.800]  and we link to the test that show this this is all been
[55:54.800 --> 55:58.320]  uh scientifically determined with human studies
[55:58.320 --> 56:04.960]  that you will get a a blocking dose uh thyroid blocking dose absorbing the
[56:04.960 --> 56:08.160]  tincture of iodine and other iodine products
[56:08.160 --> 56:12.080]  topically on your skin but again i i i need to emphasize
[56:12.080 --> 56:15.520]  two things make sure if you talk about this to anybody they
[56:15.520 --> 56:19.040]  don't think that you're talking about drinking this stuff it's poison
[56:19.040 --> 56:23.280]  but topically you can safely absorb a thyroid blocking dose and we're not
[56:23.280 --> 56:27.680]  talking about the product on info wars dot com the potassium iodide usp and you
[56:27.680 --> 56:30.400]  still talk to a doctor about that even when the radiation
[56:30.400 --> 56:34.080]  even when it goes up you're talking about tincture of iodine rubbing it on the
[56:34.080 --> 56:37.600]  stomach or on the forearms once a day a limited amount
[56:37.600 --> 56:40.960]  will also pretty much have the same effect but that's
[56:40.960 --> 56:45.200]  all broken down in your article you still must consult a physician
[56:45.200 --> 56:49.440]  or a uh a health care provider before you do that
[56:49.440 --> 56:53.920]  absolutely and so and usually the only reason by the way the federal government
[56:53.920 --> 56:56.560]  should be doing all this right now we shouldn't be having to do it
[56:56.560 --> 57:01.280]  that that has been that has been our mantra for over 12 years
[57:01.280 --> 57:05.120]  is that what we do in our little way they should be doing in a big way all
[57:05.120 --> 57:08.080]  the time and i do a lot of business is being
[57:08.080 --> 57:13.760]  redundant if they were doing their job well you saw this coming from far away
[57:13.760 --> 57:17.680]  Shane Connor and we appreciate you again the only remaining supply he's out now
[57:17.680 --> 57:21.360]  we have it because they can't handle the orders info wars
[57:21.360 --> 57:24.960]  dot com and it's a good thing we only got this much because this will take us
[57:24.960 --> 57:28.240]  four or five days to get out as quickly as we can the order they're received
[57:28.240 --> 57:32.080]  and we're shipping it two to three day us priority mail that they're racing
[57:32.080 --> 57:35.040]  right now to get out the orders that came in last night and the orders that
[57:35.040 --> 57:38.080]  come in they're going to be working over the weekend to have this out to you
[57:38.080 --> 57:41.520]  monday and tuesday info wars dot com but
[57:41.520 --> 57:44.880]  certainly that great news about tincture of iodine that you do not drink
[57:44.880 --> 57:49.040]  it's not this product but it's rubbed on the skin only if the radiation goes up
[57:49.040 --> 57:51.840]  and and again technically for yourself personally
[57:51.840 --> 57:55.360]  we only got a minute left Shane when would you take
[57:55.360 --> 57:59.120]  this product how high would the radiation have to be
[57:59.120 --> 58:05.440]  when we went get a confirmation um i've got people talking to it and listen to
[58:05.440 --> 58:11.680]  on health physics sites uh close to it and uh that's that's what i'm watching
[58:11.680 --> 58:15.440]  right now the government the big thing is the government can't
[58:15.440 --> 58:19.920]  sit on this too many people are watching it and we have the internet
[58:19.920 --> 58:26.800]  uh there is this at what level would you personally take it
[58:26.800 --> 58:29.920]  i'm i'm i'm watching my health physicists that are
[58:29.920 --> 58:32.880]  that are that are keeping an eye on it right now
[58:32.880 --> 58:36.480]  i i can't give you a number you'll wait and see what they say thank you so much
[58:36.480 --> 58:42.960]  shame connor's get it at info wars dot com
[58:42.960 --> 58:51.600]  thank you for listening to gcn visit gcn live dot com today
[58:51.600 --> 58:55.920]  alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages
[58:55.920 --> 58:58.640]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide
[58:58.640 --> 59:01.280]  we're seeing the impact right here in the united states
[59:01.280 --> 59:04.880]  ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices

[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:29.600]  radiation is driving back emergency workers at the stricken fukushima
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:33.840]  nuclear disaster site helicopters are trying to fly above dumping water
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.400]  directly on the exposed fuel rods efforts to try to restore power
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.880]  the reactors at fukushima to hachi complex are interrupted as high radiation
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.400]  forces the withdrawal of workers but it's unclear
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.640]  whether a return of power will help spent fuel rods remain the biggest
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.600]  concern they've strung a new power line
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.360]  into the area engineers at the fukushima to hachi nuclear power plant
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.440]  worked all day friday attempting to connect a newly restored power line
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.840]  to reactors number one and two but their tasks were repeatedly interrupted by
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.120]  the need to withdraw workers because of high radiation levels which they won't
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.880]  give us they just say they're high going out to the pacific towards the us the
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.920]  first vanguard just hit today they're calling it very low level because it
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.280]  was a low level friday that's what's hit us the friday radiation
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.800]  the team it takes the rest of the radiation days to get here after that
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.240]  the team said they hoped the task would be uh completed sometime friday evening
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.400]  or in the early morning hour saturday it is not clear yet
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.400]  whether restoring power to the two damaged reactors
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.480]  will help with cooling some engineers believe the cooling pumps
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.960]  were irrevocably damaged by the hydrogen explosions that wreaked
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.120]  and wrecked the reactor buildings in the first four days after the march tent
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.080]  magnitude nine uh quake or by corrosion from seawater that has
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.680]  been pumped into the reactor at the very least however restoring power
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.640]  should restore many of the controlled functions
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.560]  of the reactor but ladies and gentlemen you have seen
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:10.400]  those explosions uh continuing here officials of the tokyo electric power
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.440]  company which owns the facility 140 miles north of tokyo
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.280]  said they hope to have power connected to reactors number three and four by
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.600]  sunday reactor number building four is now the source of the biggest concern
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.880]  in the site because the contained spent fuel rods
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.640]  that may have boiled dry and releasing large amounts of radiation in the
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.560]  environment they can also explode the spent fuel rod pools
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.160]  do not have the containment vessels so the fuel rods heat up start burning a
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.200]  radioactive ash will be released directly in the environment that's
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:47.120]  already been going on for six days now workers first blew up saturday
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.400]  workers made a second series of attempts friday
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.440]  to cool the fuel rods dumping water from helicopters
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.800]  and using cannons operated by japan self-defense force
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.560]  to spray water into the pool which sits in the upper level
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.720]  of the building housing reactor number four the reactor itself has been shut
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.120]  down for maintenance before the earthquake so it does not pose a
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.200]  problem really there's reports that it could be
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.040]  breached as well we know two of them are uh but photographs taken by
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.320]  helicopters and a global haunt grown operated by the u.s air force it's so
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.080]  bad they won't send man to people in indicate the water
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.920]  is not lasting very long in the pool suggesting there is a major breach in
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.800]  the walls of the vessel holding the fuel rods well yeah you saw the
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.000]  explosions according to u.s nuclear regulatory commission
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.880]  recognizing the severity of the problem japan's nuclear regulatory agency
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.600]  today upgraded the severity of the fukushima disaster
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.640]  from a four to a five on the international scale of one to seven
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.760]  the 1986 chernobyl disaster the worst nuclear disaster in history
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.600]  was rated a seven yeah it's a seven already you can better believe that
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.760]  in 1979 three-mile island incident previously considered the second worst
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.480]  accident in history was also rated a five that was nothing compared to this
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.200]  french officials had previously called fukushima
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.560]  uh a five and now japanese authorities have agreed with their assessment
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.760]  but it is clear that fukushima is much more serious problem than three-mile
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.160]  island of course it is little or no radiation
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.800]  escape from the pennsylvania facility but they're saying this is the same as
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.000]  that and no one was injured the comprehensive test ban treaty
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.200]  organization which monitors radiation globally said friday the
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.560]  minute amounts of radiation fukushima it's minute folks
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.840]  have reached the west coast of the united states but only at barely
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.520]  detectable levels that's because it's the stuff from friday that were
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.720]  insufficient insufficient and insignificant to health
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.840]  on sunday meteorologists predicted a heavy range storm
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.040]  from the fukushima area with the prevailing winds charging towards
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.800]  the direction of tokyo that's bad news for tokyo
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.240]  i'm alex jones dr nick baggage to give us his take
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.920]  on all things new world order the earthquake heart
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.040]  could that be behind it i doubt it looks like it's the sun and moon that caused
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.040]  this corner to top folks that we've had on astrophysicist
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.400]  pierce corbin we'll be right back stay with us
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.560]  you may be arrested and or subject to other police action
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.480]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.160]  has become reality it really says that the state is god
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.000]  the united states is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.400]  police states on earth this film conclusively proves the existence of
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.480]  a secret network of fema cams now being expanded nationwide
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.080]  this documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has

[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:07.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.800]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.400]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.640]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.840]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.480]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:28.400]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.920]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.040]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.080]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.600]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.880]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest

[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.200]  Chapman on what's happening in libya and the announcement of a no-fly zone which
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.480]  means aerial bombardments of qaddafi's emplacements
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:44.320]  another war what's the larger issue here why is this happening now
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.720]  also new york fed confirms intervention and currency markets
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.720]  associated press it's all coming up today
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:56.480]  here's the latest reports of harmless radiation reaching california or a
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.000]  whitewash paul joseph watson bulk of radioactive
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.920]  particles from fukushima blast will not reach west coast until saturday
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.960]  through monday when fukushima one and three blew up
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.200]  take seven days the meteorologists predicted for it to cross they were
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.280]  correct it hit today in california only from small leaks that happened
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:19.520]  initially before meltdowns began we know containment vessels at two were open
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.800]  600 000 spent fuel rods blown sky high that were stored on top of four of the
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.960]  reactors uh they're also reporting that the
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.800]  japanese have had to pull back on relief efforts because the radiation is so high
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.160]  but they're not reporting the radiation in those two states or
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.600]  prefectures uh right around fukushima the lion share of it blowing out
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.760]  into the pacific towards north america the united states and canada
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:49.840]  uh the most southerly coming into southern california hitting earlier
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.240]  today ap rogers reporting low levels of radiation
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.520]  dr nick baggage twice elected president about the last confederation of

[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.760]  dot com is his website uh dr baggage let's
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.960]  break down your spectrum analysis you've got the floor
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.720]  of what's happening at fukushima is there a cover up you're in alaska one of
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.880]  the hardest hit areas of the plume coming uh break down where you see this
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.480]  going yeah you know this has always been uh a concern
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.960]  for alaska in fact if you remember back a number years ago there was the
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.640]  story from the balonia foundation was one who carried it out of
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.680]  europe but it was the um exposed nuclear cores in the arctic from the old
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.720]  soviet union that were just kind of sitting out there and that drift from
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.480]  all that and submarines uh and so on but the current's actually
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.440]  flowing to the gulf of alaska and this is what
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.200]  you know where y south uh central alaska stays warm we've got this japanese
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.880]  but they call the japanese current and so this uh
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.720]  the entire radioactive sort of cloud just the way in which
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.800]  atmosphere moves you know eventually ends up in the arctic where
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.360]  you have the shortest food chain because you have a real short
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.360]  chain from lichens and things that grow in in tundra areas in the
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.360]  far north where where the biggest concentrations end up eventually
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.480]  reaching and concentrating to animal populations that are ingested
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.560]  by humans because most people in the northern regions of alaska are still
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.880]  um what we call here subsistence users where it's a major part of our
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.880]  our diet because the alternative because this this is a place without roads
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.720]  that cost more to fly uh interstate alaska than to fly from
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:36.560]  alaska to washington dc and you know so
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.240]  this is a big deal here and and we have monitors actually they're bringing in
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:43.600]  more of them now uh set up in the anchorage
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.080]  bowl area and then set up around the state for monitoring that kind of fall
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.600]  out and it started way back um just after the fall of the
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:55.680]  soviet union uh and and and we got a fuller picture on
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.560]  you know what was happening there in fact the guy that broke that story went
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.920]  to jail in russia for treason for 10 months and i i lectured with him in
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:09.520]  brussels back in ah 1997 it was may in 1997 that we
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.400]  lectured together dr baggage us uh and if you
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.480]  can't speak right in your telephone for sure a little bit
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.120]  soft there uh looking at what's happening at fukushima the
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.800]  ongoing cover-ups that they've been caught in not releasing radiation
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.160]  data the 600 000s fint spent fuel rods the
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.320]  explosions uh give us your uh expert analysis on what you
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.080]  think may be happening well it's it's obviously you know i'm
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.120]  melting down and it's and and what we're
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.720]  witnessing is is is i think going to get approved to be worse than
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.480]  anything that we saw in three-mile island and maybe
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.720]  you know maybe approaching as bad as what we uh we saw in the ukraine
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.920]  a number of years ago and you know that was responsible they you know and when
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:59.360]  they really went in after the fact and started looking at the toxicology and
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.400]  the downwinders you know the uh the incidents of
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.480]  cancers and all of that and now you've got a fairly good demographic in fact
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.560]  there was a uh an excellent person on this issue uh
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:15.120]  rosalie burtell who was and is considered one of the world's experts
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.120]  on radio radiological victim and you know this is the big
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.800]  the big thing is it uh substantially changed
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.880]  uh within that region and then of course uh over time all of that gets
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.040]  defined and right now i think it's sort of keeping the keeping the lid on it
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.120]  because of just how much real damage i mean a lot of people died in the
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.480]  immediate event of a tsunami but the following event
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.920]  of radioactive pollen will probably kill more than the 10,000
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:46.640]  are estimated dead by the way dr baggage uh the united
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.480]  nations uh the new york times the atomic energy agency estimate
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.400]  a million deaths in the last 25 years directly connected
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.480]  to chair noble we're going to play on screen for prison planet dot tv viewers
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.800]  a government map of of what chair noble did in 10 days
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.120]  it blew all over uh europe and for six months school children
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.480]  were only fed uh frozen food flown in uh from outside of europe
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:16.240]  i don't expect to see our government if more radiation comes this way
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.960]  warning people not to eat the fish in alaska
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:24.160]  warning people not to drink milk uh i mean uh if it's any indication what's
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.640]  happened in dallas at dfw and what's happened you know here in
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.160]  chicago the planes came in with radiation inside the
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:36.000]  cabins their clothes their bags the people and they just let them go on
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.760]  through they didn't take it they didn't put a nuclear dump so it shows
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.760]  and ancultures in the news today headline a glowing report on radiation
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.840]  saying we should be thankful that this is healthy and good for us
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.000]  you know i i i think the uh uh bottom line is i think
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.160]  people should again sort of look out there right now you can't get them up
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.440]  because they're they're sort of out of stock but
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.240]  simple radiation detectors that pick up the background radiation i i had one
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.920]  for uh many years when i traveled and it was um
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:12.960]  and you can kind of just measure uh in rad the background radiation count and
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.720]  a few observations firstly it does vary from place to place
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:20.240]  and i was in this would have been the middle nineties
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:23.680]  and in traveling around europe and kind of thinking you know where where's the
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.920]  downwinders and there is a difference you know there's a substantial uh
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.440]  difference from place to place back in those days but then the other
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.200]  observation that i made that i wasn't really aware of most people aren't as
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.960]  as you go on on the ground background radiation you know you'll get a count of
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.160]  around 20 uh rats uh and it's you know pretty
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.280]  you know that's considered pretty reasonable in some places even less
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.400]  10 rats but as you go off an elevation you know you get an
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.840]  iron plane and you start measuring your rats when you get up to
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.920]  30 000 feet you're running about 700 so that's a big change and so when you
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:04.080]  look at these hotspots that are running even it's substantially
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.880]  higher but you know you look at it look at pilots and
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.960]  stewardesses and business flyers you could fly a lot of hours every year
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.560]  and if if you look at their analysis of certain kinds of cancer
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:18.720]  you'll probably see some statistical variables there too and that's just low
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.400]  level radiation not what we're talking about here and this is
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.680]  well now the mainstream media is saying meltdowns may have occurred the
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:29.920]  japanese are covering it up right now dr baggage
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.280]  but if we do have meltdown at one or more of those and it's blowing right
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:37.600]  across the pacific this is a big issue but our media
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.960]  predominantly is still playing it down why do you think that is
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:44.960]  well i because uh you know obviously uh the kind of
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.720]  a panic in the same time media i think is slow
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:52.640]  to really gather uh the data and bring it forward just the way media runs these
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.080]  days and there's a lot of interest in what the economic gains are
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.360]  you know a couple hundred billion dollars worth of reconstruction
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.480]  so you don't want to be shut out of an area and i think at the same time they
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.240]  don't want to create panic for the market and then you know you already saw
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.880]  enough fluctuation in markets but here's something to consider in terms of
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.320]  what we're really learning is not just what this event did but you know i've
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.240]  driven the coast to california and you know southern california right along
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.120]  north of san diego's a great nuclear plant you know sitting on the coast
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.280]  and we have those same kinds of risk presented in seismic areas in the united
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.720]  states and the larger issue is you know what's the better
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:36.800]  technologies that are out there that we could be applying energy needs to have
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.040]  a significantly lower risk and and a lot higher yield per capital
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.960]  dollar because these these plants not only are expensive to build and
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.360]  generally are overrun by cost but you know when you really look at
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:54.560]  the big picture risk these are them and and in seismic areas these are risks
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.600]  that we really should be considering more carefully and and we have it and
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.720]  this is maybe the bigger issue you know facing the country and well that's it
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.160]  because when you raise concerns about this they call you a commie
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.680]  and then oh you just don't like nuclear power folks i'm all about power i'm all
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.360]  about coal power i'm all about hydroelectric i'm all about wind i'm all
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.000]  about technology but the truth is the entire nuclear industry worldwide
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.680]  has a horrible history with government of covering things up whether it's the
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:27.200]  japanese whether it's the russians the u.s all
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.200]  of them have a horrible history and and and and i am
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.960]  quite frankly sick of it stay there i want to come back and talk about
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:38.160]  where you see this going dr baggages and we're going to open the phones up
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.760]  for anybody that wants to comment on this or libya or the economy

[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.640]  daddy i'm hungry that little girl will get fed
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:08.480]  for now but what if people like glenn beck are right about the threats we face
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.840]  if the u.s dollar loses its status as the global reserve currency
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.840]  prices on the things you need most will skyrocket food may be unaffordable or
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:19.200]  worse unavailable earthquakes economic turmoil
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.200]  continuing unemployment rampant inflation and even threats of terrorism

[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:20.240]  okay your phone calls are coming up the next segment on the new war with the
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.480]  NATO and UN announcing are to start bombing that's called the no fly zone
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.480]  now Libya we've got what's the huge developments
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.520]  in the economy we're going to be breaking down next hour with
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.200]  bob Chapman dr. nick baggots joins us now breaking down the unfolding
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.200]  disaster at Fukushima dr. nick baggots whenever I read
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.040]  this ap article LA Times as well radiation
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:46.480]  hamper its efforts to restore power the nuclear plant in Japan that they're
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.720]  having to pull back because the radiation is so high but they won't tell us
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.560]  what the levels are in those two Japanese states
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.880]  are prefectures right in that area I mean that right there is a horrible sign
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.320]  is it not yeah it is you know in fact um
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.400]  uh that that the lack of information probably tells you a great deal right
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.320]  now and you know and I think what we'll see is uh
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.160]  again it's going to be a big um a much much bigger event
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.400]  as the story unfolds and and the bigger question and I think that's part of it
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.880]  too your nuclear industry is a big industry and they
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:26.960]  have lobbied political bodies wherever these facilities exist at the point
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.160]  where you know they've rented a few politicians for
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:34.080]  for long-term investments and I think that's probably part of why we're not
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.920]  here and so much either is you know that's a very very powerful
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:41.360]  uh political lobby and and the reality of that lobby
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:46.480]  um you know are these kinds of of risks now the other side of that is you know
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:51.920]  and I'm really with with you on um energy resources we have gas
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:56.880]  oil uh coal particularly um because there's some new technologies in that
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.520]  area you know coal alone um could take uh the u.s. completely out of the
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.680]  energy import business uh technology that um one of my
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.080]  colleagues just got back from the ctl the coal to liquids conference in
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.600]  paris that took place here about a week and a half two weeks ago
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.000]  and you know at that conference um a u.s. based company using a
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.960]  somewhere just around a billion dollars of exxon mobile based research
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.400]  in two areas one in uh co2 suppression or a recapture
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.520]  and the other in um coal to liquids technology that actually yields
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.400]  uh get this 5.3 um equivalent uh barrels of jet fuel
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:46.400]  per ton of coal by adding in uh some natural gas which here in alaska by the
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.680]  way we have 2 000 years of known domestic coal supplies
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.840]  and tens of thousands of trillions with a t
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:01.040]  cubic feet of natural gas 25 of the world's left and it burns very clean
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:05.520]  that's why the un and the big bankers are on record and the oil company trying
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:10.400]  to shut down gas trying to shut down coal because with the technologies all
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.760]  that comes out is carbon dioxide and water vapor of the coal
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:17.440]  almost nothing comes out from the gas that's why they're listing it as a toxic
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.160]  waste folks do you want do you want plutonium or
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.600]  uranium blowing up or do you want some carbon dioxide
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.560]  well here's the thing this is what this is what's really interesting is they
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:32.160]  use a um uh a hybridized uh blue green algae
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.080]  carbon suppression sink that actually when you when you net it out on this
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.680]  on the newest technology what you end up with
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:45.280]  is half um the so-called pollutants being generated per
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:49.520]  uh unit of fuel and you get the lowest sulfur
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:56.480]  content fuel in the world and you get 20 more btu's per unit which means
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:02.400]  you can get 20 more range on a drone or predator or a jet aircraft which
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.200]  changes the economics of air transport and this technology
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:11.120]  works at about $50 a barrel oil and so
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:15.360]  you and the excess here now this is another bonus is because it produces a
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.360]  large amount of heat in the in this catalytic process because it's not a
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.640]  coal to gas to liquid this is a coal with a
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:28.480]  um a chemical catalyst and temperature and then you end up with 200 to 400
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.520]  megawatts of excess electric power beyond what you
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.520]  need to run the facility so it it really produces a
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.400]  a net um you can actually have a net negative in other words be consuming
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.840]  based on the design of these plants so that you don't produce any
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:47.920]  uh emissions and you actually net some out i mean but doctor as you know in
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:53.600]  our history carbon dioxide has been 50 you know 14 times just recently
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.880]  higher than it is now many scientists believe the earth is actually carbon
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.680]  dioxide starved i don't think carbon dioxide being
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:03.040]  released is bad well and here's the thing about all of it if
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:06.480]  you look at the carbon cycle over the planet and over its history
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:11.040]  it as you say it has varied dramatically and you know so is conditions on the
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.880]  planet varied over time and that had very little in fact nothing
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:18.000]  uh to do with what what man contributes to the process
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.600]  but even if you buy into all the arguments the fact the matter is
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.080]  even those guys have to accept coal as a bible alternative what we're doing now
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.320]  i've looked at everything um clinton took off limits the clean burning coal in
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:34.480]  utah the biggest deposit in the world and he had companies he was connected to in
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:38.320]  china who had the second biggest their stocks doubled when that decision was
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.280]  made you don't even need the scrubbers with that clean burning coal to the
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:44.960]  levels they have it uh coal is king i've studied it all
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:50.800]  ladies and gentlemen coal is what we need coal is king
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.640]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.920]  americans at home i've turned the members influence
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:20.000]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.200]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention

[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:11.040]  we're seeing the impact right here in the united states
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.640]  ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:18.960]  hit a 30 month high in february and pump prices are expected to reach five
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:23.040]  dollars a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the

[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:32.880]  ladies and gentlemen the cover-up has imploded
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:39.440]  the director of the plant broke down and began to cry at a press conference
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.480]  and basically said they can no longer deceive the public
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.720]  that the levels are deadly and can kill people
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:51.440]  it is mainly blowing out to see here's the devastating news japanese
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.200]  us chinese and south korean meteorologist
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.760]  among some of the best in the world are giving a near certain chance with the
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:02.960]  meteorology that the winds will shift from
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:07.120]  straight east due east towards the united states
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:10.400]  saturday and sunday directly towards tokyo
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:15.600]  in what is becoming obvious is a massive multi-chair noble level meltdown
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.040]  the mail online it's all over japanese news i'm getting chills right now
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:23.040]  ladies and gentlemen 37 million people in tokyo 150 miles south
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.400]  heavy winds and rain which then dumps it on the public
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.880]  headed saturday and sunday the winds are still east but believed to shift
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.880]  in the meteorology reports towards tokyo that's on info wars dot com
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.480]  and drudge report has the article up as well the moment
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.480]  the nuclear plant chief wept as japanese finally admit the radiation leak is
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:46.720]  serious enough to kill people and they've known this since
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:51.840]  reactor one blew up saturday that radiation set to hit the united states
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.600]  in the next 48 hours then 24 hours after that i just got
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.440]  chills again monday the mark one plutonium uranium
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.080]  based reactor that when they developed in the 70s
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.920]  massive amounts of ge nuclear physicist engineers
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.040]  resigned and people won't remember that so let's put it on screen
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:14.960]  a general electric scientist resigned over mark one design
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.240]  not to mention the 640 plus thousand fuel rods
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.960]  hundreds of thousands of which were stored on top the buildings that blow
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.040]  sky high i'm getting chills right now dr baggidge
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.520]  dr baggidge uh he is broken down the boss of the company will put it on screen
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.120]  showing him crying behind the devastating japanese nuclear reactor
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.640]  today broke down in tears as his country finally acknowledged the
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:40.000]  radiation spewing from the overheating reactors that's called meltdown
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.560]  and fuel rods was enough to kill some citizens
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:45.680]  japan i mean and we got calls from people that have friends in japan that
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.800]  just got out of japan saying folks are vomiting red faced
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.480]  uh with radiation sickness japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:55.120]  admitted that the disaster was a level five
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:58.160]  they're saying that's the equivalent of three-mile island but experts even in
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.360]  la times are saying that's a joke it's worse than turnable a seven
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.520]  which is classified as a crisis causing several radiation deaths by the un
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:08.640]  international atomic energy officials said the rating was raised but they
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.120]  realized the full extent of the radiation leaking from the plant
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.640]  they also said three percent of the fuel and three of the reactors
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:17.280]  at fukushima plant may have been severely damaged
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.200]  suggesting those reactor cores have partially melted down that was going on
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.360]  saturday folks after tokyo electric power company managing director
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.400]  a co comari cried as he left a conference to brief
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.640]  journalist on the situation at fukushima a senior japanese minister
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:38.080]  also admitted that the country was overwhelmed by the scale
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:41.760]  of the tsunami and the nuclear crisis he said officials
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:45.360]  uh should have admitted earlier how serious the radiation leaks
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:50.160]  were chief cabinet secretary uh then added the unprecedented scale the
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:53.360]  earthquake the tsunami that struck japan frankly speaking were on many things
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:56.320]  that happened that have not anticipated under our disaster management
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:00.160]  really tsunamis don't come with uh with earthquakes they don't cause them
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:05.600]  the earthquakes don't cause them uh the chief cabinet secretary uh added the
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:09.600]  in hindsight we could have moved a little quicker in assessing the situation
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.720]  they were too busy covering it up and coordinating the information and
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:16.320]  providing it faster nuclear experts have been saying for days that japan was
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:20.400]  ununderplaying the the severity of the crisis
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.920]  um going back to dr nick baggage baggage or what do you make of this
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:29.920]  you know that's it's just what we were saying before the um sorry broke you
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.640]  know it was a meltdown um it's it is it on a much larger scale and that's
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.920]  and that and it's going to continue to unfold that way now the other
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.480]  part of this is you and i think we've we've done it before we've had the
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:46.080]  conversation before but we really need to look again
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.160]  at sort of where we cited these things and how much risk they presently
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:52.560]  uh present because you know when you think about
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.960]  uh the united states and our our vulnerabilities through the same kinds
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:00.640]  of uh natural disasters both in the midwestern states
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:04.320]  um because of the fault system there now it's been a few hundred years
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.080]  uh since that one's broken loose but the last it's so powerful the mississippi
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.400]  change course right it went it went the other
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:13.200]  direction and you know they could feel it all the way to
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.960]  washington dc you know i mean that the thing about um
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.920]  this you know there's another seismic area in new york
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.480]  goes right through new york city um doctor there's a giant fault line and
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:28.240]  three extinct volcanoes in austin and they actually built a huge
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:32.320]  experimental reactor on top the fault line in north austin
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:35.760]  right now and and and you look at southern california and california and
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.760]  you know a number of facilities so when we start to really look at the
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:43.680]  risks i mean those are legitimate risks and and and risks that
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.800]  we also face in the united states and we know why it happened i want you to
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:50.320]  comment on this and we're going to calls when you get a huge
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.200]  hundred billion three hundred billion dollar in the aggregate trillion
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.280]  dollar industry they've got the lobbyist
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:58.560]  common sense people don't they want to build these things
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.240]  that's exactly right and and it is about that you know i i'll tell you
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:07.840]  um coming from uh uh 50 50 years of experience in a political family
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:13.040]  uh... the reality is it has shifted that direction more so now
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:18.480]  than ever before because it is uh lobbyist i've been back to dc once to
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:21.760]  um uh do some work back there to see my brother once
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.840]  since he's been elected in the last two years
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:27.520]  and my shock you know was i hadn't been there and maybe
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:31.520]  15 20 years you know in terms of just being there but not on political
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:34.640]  business as since my dad was in the congress
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:39.440]  and my shock was i walked into a building we were we were headed to a lobbyist
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:42.160]  office we're walking the building i thought where's it where's the where's
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:45.520]  the office and that that guy says you're standing in it
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.600]  it was 16 floors and it was just one firm out of hundreds
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:55.360]  um in dc uh and and many dozens at least that size and so i look around and i
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.000]  i started recognizing the reality of dc is it's inaccessible
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.080]  uh unless you are special interest uh to large degree and that's why
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:07.760]  whenever you have the opportunity to exercise
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:11.920]  you know any political speech you should because these guys also still have to
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:15.840]  get elected and until they finish hijacking the election
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:22.160]  process uh entirely we we really have to defend the republic and in the sense
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:27.120]  of being everyone needs to be absolutely dr begich expanding on that
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.160]  the lobbyists come in and try to get government to mandate we must take
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.960]  dangerous vaccines they come in and mandate right that they're going to put
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.080]  their sodium fluoride toxic waste in our water they come in and mandate that
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:39.680]  we're going to invade more countries and the globalists are all competing with
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:42.320]  each other like a bunch of mad dogs they're
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.640]  destroying their own self-interest what is all these trillions of dollars worth
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:50.720]  if their own kids die of leukemia from the radiation
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:56.880]  well you know again if you if you look at it there's a lot of uh reckless
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.840]  thinking and a lot of not thinking you know people are motivated by all
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.040]  different things and people's ability to assert on a
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.960]  on full knowledge is pretty limited and greed and human nature in a lot of
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:10.560]  cases overrides uh good judgment more often than we'd like to
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:15.120]  believe in corporations you know that's how they keep score you know i mean
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:19.520]  it's the bottom line it doesn't have anything to do with uh national uh
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.400]  interest these are multinational corporations and so they look at the
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:26.720]  the world is just a big marketplace with seven billion people that might be
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.080]  consumers on some level and when you look at the world
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:34.000]  and what's being developed in the world you know America's been abandoned on
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.120]  the basis that it's only 300 million people
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:41.680]  they got billions trying to catch up and that's why what you're seeing is
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:45.680]  huge inflation and commodity prices it still hasn't really registered to the
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:51.280]  american public you see the downstream effects of bad judgment on
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:54.880]  technology deployment uh and lying to the public when
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:58.000]  they get caught early in the game you know i'm thinking about tobacco industry
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.600]  in terms of what they hid you have no clue what the
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:06.000]  collusion between the atomic energy commission and everything that's come
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.080]  from it you know uh and and in terms of what the industry
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.320]  is built is huge and and so consequently
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.520]  always again it's public health is at risk
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.960]  because of some corporate interests that we're able to
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.720]  stretch the politician and the regulation and that's
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:28.480]  fundamentally why you're seeing rebellion it's a different form of
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.360]  corruption you know what's going on the middle east is rebellion against
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:34.880]  corruption but what's the difference you know we just institutionalized our
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:38.560]  corruption now now we call a bribe a campaign contribution but what's the
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:44.000]  difference when it buys influence outcomes uh and and and access
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.840]  that you and i as private citizens can't get
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:52.080]  that's a problem and that is the root of the problem quite frankly
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.160]  uh is that equation because it takes it takes the republic it takes this
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:00.080]  democracy away from us uh in that sense and and the
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:04.880]  representation aspect of how our democratic republic is set
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:10.720]  up um is is is hijacked by soulless entities called
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.920]  corporations that have no political boundaries
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:17.520]  that is a problem they're driving too much political process
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.520]  uh in the in the process and these are the kinds of outcomes
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:25.520]  when disaster hits oh we didn't plan for this of course you didn't
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:30.000]  because you ignored the obvious and and that's and then lobbied your way
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.600]  through the regulation and the controversy
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.240]  dr baggots i'm ready to go to phone calls uh we're again very honored to have
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:41.680]  your expertise here looking at the wider issue but
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:44.400]  before we go to calls in just about a minute or two
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.320]  break down how from studying government your dad being a powerful congressman
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.920]  your brother being a u.s senator you being a governmental leader in alaska
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.160]  studying how government operates the japanese seven days in admit it's all
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:00.000]  been a cover-up uh it's much worse than they said the meltdowns are going on at
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.200]  multiple reactors that was going on admittedly monday but now
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.120]  they admit people are dying that it is killing people how do you expect from
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.920]  studying chair noble that put out high levels of
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:14.400]  radiation three thousand miles away of when the radiation intensifies in the
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:17.520]  next few days how they're going to try to cover this up and how do we counter
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:21.840]  that well i i think there are um independent people with
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:26.320]  access to uh rad detectors and what would be really useful
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:29.680]  we used to carry one and we sold a bunch of them around the country and if
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.160]  there's anyone that has one uh right now they're back ordering them like two
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.960]  three weeks uh with the supplier we used to work with
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:41.440]  but these instruments um exist in universities exist
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:45.200]  uh all around and and i would say that's uh that's one of the things that
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:49.920]  citizens can do is start monitoring with reliable equipment the background
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:53.280]  radiation and start reporting it into us into maybe
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.480]  an into a central location so it can be uh mapped and
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.600]  charted and kept track of and there's no one doing that independently it would
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.120]  be an excellent uh thing to put together doctor i did deep
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:06.080]  research and i want your take on this we gotta go to calls
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.000]  i did deep research on the the six months to a year after chair noble
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.160]  in italy in germany in france they would not let the school children drink milk
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:18.720]  from europe they flew in frozen produce and and meat and fish
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:23.120]  because they said look we can't you know we're doing spot checks everything's got
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.160]  radiation in it even though it's moderate to low
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:30.160]  when you get multiple exposures it can it can bioaccumulate as you said in the
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.200]  food chain to high in humans we know the effects of
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:38.480]  radiation are many times worse four fast growing cells uh in in young humans
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.720]  but all other uh uh growing mammals and animals insects
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.200]  you name it i don't see our government doing what europe did they'll just say
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:50.480]  eat the food right you know i mean think about the whole
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:54.320]  uh story when uh the terrorism story about
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:58.880]  a dirty bomb a dirty bomb well we just witnessed a dirty bomb you know and
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.880]  uh mother nature just ignited it you know and people weren't ready for it but
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:06.960]  that's in fact what we have here on a much bigger scale
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:11.200]  uh than anything contemplated that a terrorist could have pulled off so
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:14.320]  you know if you want to put things in perspective remember
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:19.040]  all the uh stories and uh and government line on
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:22.800]  uh terrorists and dirty bombs you carry in a suitcase well this suitcase was the
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:27.520]  size of a couple of buildings you know i mean you look at four big buildings
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.560]  sitting there uh in some stage of meltdown and by the way
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:34.960]  fox continues last night today to show stock footage of Fukushima
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:38.240]  before anything was damaged and say look here's the plant
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:42.000]  total subliminal well really overt but people aren't conscious so it's
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.160]  subliminal that everything's okay very deceptive by them last
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:49.360]  question i promise we're going to ryan tony will jennifer and mic but i've
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:52.800]  got to ask you this my phone's rung off the hook emails i know
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.840]  you've gotten it um saying this had to be harp
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.040]  that i that i'm covering it up because i'm not talking about harp
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:04.080]  look i've had pierce corbin the top astrophysicist who has an 85 percent
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:08.000]  even mainstream news says year out extreme weather forecast
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.760]  because he goes off the sun electromagnetic and the moon
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:15.040]  blocking that and the tides he says that the moon
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:19.120]  we had the closest moon in 18 years they called the giant moon
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.760]  pulling the magma not just the tides with a huge solar flare that hit six
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.200]  hours before this massive earthquake he's saying no
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:30.720]  doubt that that's what did it that's mother nature's heart
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:35.120]  yeah you know actually that's um uh those are in fact really good observations
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.360]  and you can add into that the resonance effect of the planets when they line up
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:42.400]  on the other side of the sun which is also happening right now
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.240]  uh and will continue for the next few weeks this sort of orientation i think
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:49.520]  the the the odds are here's something to think
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:53.600]  about the odds are uh we're going to see some more of this and in other places
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:56.880]  on the on the ring of fire and and the most vulnerable
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.800]  um places where the plates are locked or the northwestern portion of the united
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.200]  states um where you where you have a huge fault zone
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.960]  that presents just the same kind of risk as what we've seen in other places but
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:12.240]  along the whole pacific rim i would suspect we'll see
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:17.360]  a couple other major quakes even within the next few weeks and not you know
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.800]  and just based on what we're seeing um by the way sir this is not hokey
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.480]  even abc news two weeks before said a lot of
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:31.120]  of astrophysicists were predicting mega quakes the truth is
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.640]  the the the you and others love to say the sun has no effect on climate which is
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.760]  like you know you know saying water has no effect on fish
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:41.600]  the truth is real scientists know it's the moon and the sun that are the chief
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.240]  drivers right and you're talking about i mean think
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:48.480]  about um uh we have 22 foot tidal height differences
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.960]  here in my part of of the world uh that's pretty extreme when you think about
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.560]  how much the earth and how much materials being moved
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:00.800]  uh and and you know i mean those solar cycles and um uh um
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.400]  gravitational cycles you know the the word lunatic
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.080]  comes from lunar because of that lunar cycle that people recognize long ago
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.160]  well think about 90 water in the brain and 70 in the body
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.440]  and yeah you're going to be affected on a very fundamental
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:19.840]  electromagnetic level like you know in terms of gravitational fields and how
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.760]  well wildlife goes crazy during full moons even if it's overcast
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.520]  as scientists have shown it's not the light of the moon that's doing it
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.640]  i mean i mean i remember being a teenager running around under a full moon
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:34.800]  you feel energized right now the harp uh issue now that's
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:39.200]  important to to recognize because harp was designed to do
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.320]  things that nature does um but do it using the instrument on the ground the
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:47.120]  difference is you get you would get a very coherent
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:50.480]  kind of signal something that would be taking advantage of certain resonance
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:55.200]  effects and then allowing uh uh the natural magnetic
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:58.720]  field line amplification right you're basically tapping
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:02.240]  into energy that's already there or triggering energy like triggering a
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.520]  a volcanic eruption or say a a fault slip
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:09.680]  where energy is built up you can resonate in and energy in at a very subtle
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:12.880]  level but builds up to the point where that energy gets released
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:17.680]  or an earthquake occurs and this is um the thing that happens every time
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.360]  there's a major earthquake i don't care whether it's uh Haiti
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:27.360]  japan uh the tsunami that hit um uh thailand and indonesia
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.120]  you know all of them but we have people hit us all the time and say it's harp
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.800]  it's harp well there's no independent monitoring which is the first problem
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:39.360]  uh that i'm aware of that can can affirm that by defining which signals are
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.520]  responsible for those events all right dr baggage this is really important
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.360]  information but we've got to go to calls i want to keep you five minutes into the
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.720]  next hour with us we can at least get to these calls but finish your point
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:54.800]  well and the point is don't jump to that conclusion but the important point is
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:59.280]  man can do this today and that is important because the same kind of bad
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:02.560]  policy that leads to nuclear meltdowns and i think that's
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:07.360]  that's the real point on advanced technologies move slow if we move it all
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:10.960]  in some directions because this could trigger something
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:14.560]  they don't fully control what they're doing could cause an even bigger
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.840]  cataclysm ryan in seattle thank you for holding her on the air with dr
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:20.960]  nick baggage hey thanks guys i really appreciate
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:25.120]  appreciate both your guys work um speaking of fox you mentioned fox
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:28.800]  earlier alex and you know i'm just totally i'm upset with them
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.440]  anyways but i mean they totally shepherd smith
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:35.120]  really made me mad the other day he's been i heard him call people dumb don't be
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:39.200]  dumb and go get ian you know a potassium iodide
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:42.960]  you know it's just these mind tricks they don't want you to learn to be
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:47.600]  self-sufficient it's bad to ever respond to a threat
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:52.480]  right exactly it's like uh i just don't i just want to reach through the tv and
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.400]  slap them every time i watch fox they show fukushima video
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:59.920]  of it undamaged and do not tell people that it's
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:04.320]  months old exactly and you know about heart
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:08.000]  i mean i guess it is a possibility for them to do that
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.600]  and then in the midst of it uh the un passes a deal that
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.840]  uh no fly zone over libya you know it all seems like it would go together
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:20.240]  but i i i truly believe it here's yeah but here's the deal look at look at the
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:23.680]  ancients all the earthquakes and cataclysms they had and it wasn't hard
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:28.320]  then we are living on floating islands of rock on top of
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:32.480]  molten lava i appreciate your call correct dr baggage
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:36.160]  that that is that is true in fact um you know we
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:41.120]  this whole uh uh the the old models for geology were that it moved slowly and
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:44.720]  gradually over a million a year millions of years and certain processes do
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:49.040]  indeed do that but others are uh very quick sudden
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:52.640]  and cataclysmic as as we just saw and this is not even
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.160]  the biggest ones the planet is seen that you know they can look at the
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:59.360]  record along coastlines and look at where there were tidal waves and where
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:03.440]  these events occurred over hundreds and even thousands of years and we have
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:07.280]  not seen anything compared to what the earth is possible well that's why till
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.080]  shoemaker levy hit saturn they believe it was every million
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:13.520]  years or so that a big asteroid hit now they admit it could be every ten
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:16.480]  thousand uh just off of now what they've
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:20.720]  watched in the solar system their stuff slamming into planets continually
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:25.200]  let's go ahead and talk to uh tony in michigan you're on the air tony
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:28.960]  hi guys uh thanks for the opportunity to talk to you um
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:32.800]  i'm calling about an anomaly a possible anomaly i noticed in the first
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:36.720]  explosion at the number one plant there in fukushima but alex
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:40.960]  i want your uh staff to go back to obama's press conference last
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:45.600]  friday i believe early in the afternoon where he briefly mentioned japan
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:48.800]  and then went into something about gas prices there's a sound bite in there
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:52.560]  you got to get for your phone now he barely talks about it he barely it's
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:56.880]  it's insane well he actually said in his press conference that the american
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:01.680]  people are in a trance quoted him he said that when the gas prices
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:06.000]  a few years ago went up above four dollars the american people got upset
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.600]  this is i'm paraphrasing out because i don't have the transcript
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:12.800]  he said but then they slipped right back into their trance
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:16.880]  and and that that's a sound bite that needs to well they know with television
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:21.360]  that people medically this is a fact are in a trance who watch a lot of tv
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:25.600]  not just when they're watching it but guys uh try to go to youtube and type in
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:29.760]  obama's statement on japan from last friday
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:34.480]  uh because i do remember that uh where was he when he gave that speech
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:38.000]  i'm not sure where he was but it was early in the afternoon and
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.680]  right after he mentioned japan he started talking about gas prices
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:47.920]  yeah search obama's statement on japan uh march 11th and then we can find that
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.680]  video uh and or or you can type obama comments on gas
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:56.400]  prices and uh on youtube you know type it in to search in the last week
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:59.920]  is that selections for searching and we'll find that a good point tony will
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:04.720]  look that up uh he even called the ncaa picks two days ago a good diversion
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:08.640]  for america they really throw this in our face don't they dr baggage
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:12.000]  yeah i you know again it's it's this whole um
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.160]  just the whole way in which the things are flowing right now and at the same
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:20.720]  time how information is restricted um i you know these are the big concerns i've
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:24.000]  got and the fact that we can't see in the open media
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.360]  um a clear really independent media they're all just sort of weighing the
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:30.640]  press releases and giving what i call the neutered news
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:35.520]  you know and it's it's it's news without any form or any deep research and it's
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:39.520]  it's a talking head on on the television reporting
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:42.800]  you know i consider what you do and what i do is reporting the news you know
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:45.600]  trying to find the facts and get them in front of the public
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:50.480]  uh in a way that we can at least have the knowledge to start reacting to an
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:53.200]  in a in a different way than being heard it along
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.520]  absolutely doctor i've got to interrupt again and got to let tony go we just got
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:02.560]  dom from japan calling us from japan dom you're on the air with dr baggage go
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.200]  ahead oh hello um actually my question is for
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.000]  you alex um i'm living in japan do you know where
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.720]  that is uh no sirs tell us tell us what area
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:23.600]  uh that's 133 miles south of sendai and fukushima yeah the winds are going to
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:26.560]  change they now admit it's deadly levels of radiation
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:30.560]  the meteorologists predict you that's going to turn towards you i would
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:33.840]  if i was you before everybody else figures is out if you can do it i would
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:36.160]  get out of japan dr baggage what would you do
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:40.320]  well i i think so in fact united states um as i understand it today is
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:44.960]  suggesting that citizens u.s citizens leave japan return to the u.s and
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:48.480]  that's another indicator you know without creating a panic rush to the
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:52.880]  airport it's again that kind of um
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:56.400]  subtle warning in advance to more information and that's always the way
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.320]  it goes and dom that's how i'll get your
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.600]  families out and get everyone else out and dom i jumped to conclusions there
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:06.480]  was that your question well that was one that was one big
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:10.160]  question i wanted to know what the exact levels were
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:13.680]  and i also wanted just to thank you for your good work
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:16.480]  now that i have the opportunity on the line i'm actually
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:19.840]  a member of scholars for 911 truth and justice
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:24.080]  and i know all the hard work that you're doing and dr bowman
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:27.840]  and ray mcgovern and i can name a bunch of other people and i know they're
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.160]  working really hard and i appreciate that
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:35.760]  uh stay there dom i want to talk to you more dr baggage comments on what he
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:38.720]  just said no i think it's all uh you know important
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:42.320]  stuff and you know there's got to be a consular office somewhere close by
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.680]  to catch them and they're going to tell you it's it's time to maybe consider
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:54.160]  coming back yeah i appreciate that advice
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:58.880]  sir anything else dom from japan anything else that
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:03.200]  uh you can tell us about what you're seeing in japan the announcements now
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:06.000]  by the head of tokyo power and electric the head of the plant
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.280]  that it was basically a cover-up and that it is very deadly and breaking down
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:14.080]  crying well you know you don't get a whole
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:17.440]  lot of news like i've been kind of looking on the internet and you don't
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:23.520]  get really a lot there um that's kind of why i called you because
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:26.880]  i've been watching your show for a long time i checked the things you say i
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:31.760]  know that you'd tell the truth and uh i wanted to see what you had to
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:36.640]  say about it so um for the last few days there's
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:42.320]  been like little shakes going on which is kind of
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:50.640]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:54.720]  a very wealthy us citizen is predicting that in 2011
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:58.800]  we will witness the most important day in america in more than 50 years
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:02.560]  he says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:05.840]  invest educate your children and even how you take care of your health and
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:09.280]  your own family now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:12.560]  years the crazy part is he's usually right you see
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:16.160]  he predicted the collapse of gm panty may friday mac and america's
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:19.120]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:23.520]  barons called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:26.240]  can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:30.080]  important prediction yet and it's a real eye opener i can't stress this
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:32.720]  enough you should at least watch this free video online
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:36.320]  today he explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take

[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:28.000]  folks i'm not going to hide this from listeners okay if you hear chirping in
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.560]  the background or you hear a guest talking and it sounds
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:33.360]  like i'm breaking in and not listening when they stop talking
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.880]  it's routine for me to be on the phone and hear directing things
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.880]  or on the back channel during emergencies i'm here on the radio right
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:45.520]  now talking to the office 30 40 yards away trying to keep info
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:48.960]  wars dot com up because of a top drudge link
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:52.400]  i don't like to do the bad computer etiquette of bouncing at the prison
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:55.760]  planet it's the ad servers and things on info wars
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:59.760]  that do this but there's denials about that but the point is is that i can see
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:03.520]  that it's the ad server doing it right there it's the first thing that hangs
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:06.480]  john harman is up there we're trying to keep info wars
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:10.800]  up i'm going to make a decision on this in the next five minutes if we're going
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:13.200]  to bounce to prison planet of matt drudge is listening
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:16.160]  i know you like to link to info wars we end up bouncing to prison planet
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:20.240]  we just can't handle the bandwidth here but i haven't made the decision yet
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:24.000]  and again i'm giving directives the guys in the other office
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.960]  people get to see some behind the scenes here now the trap of craziness that goes
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:31.360]  on but turn off comments on all of info wars
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:34.640]  is there a way to freeze that through varnish
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:39.040]  through the cds i don't respond back as i'm going back live on air but that's
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:42.160]  my statement to you so that you'll have answers for me in four minutes when we
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:46.160]  go back to break uh dr nick baggage uh continuing
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:52.400]  here with the caller in japan dom do you have any questions for dom in japan
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:55.760]  just uh i would expect you're going to continue to get uh tremors
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:59.120]  um as things stabilize i mean it's probably the frequency has dropped
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:02.560]  probably dramatically from that first couple of days but um you know those are
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:06.560]  still happening and as people do clean up and and or organizing what they're
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.360]  doing they need they need to be uh and are i know cognizant of all that
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:14.720]  dom what's there's
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:18.560]  go ahead i was just going to say there are little
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:22.480]  uh tremors even here in qiba i mean and that's you know
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:28.320]  133 miles away and you know you can really feel it here in the apartment
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:32.160]  so it's shake rattle and roll there have been hundreds of aftershocks some as
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:36.960]  high as a seven correct dr baggage right right exactly right you know and
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:40.640]  the thing about a lot of these quakes that they you know we have um we've had
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.960]  sevens here in the last 10 years but they're in such remote areas
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:49.120]  and there's no one with anything over a story or two
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:52.240]  so you don't get this kind of um devastation a lot of them have been
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:56.640]  inland so you're not getting the title um issues either but you know again
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.800]  you look at the plate system um up for alaskan the west coast and
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:04.960]  and you get the dynamic of what's going on here as the pacific plate
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:08.240]  uh gets shoved up underneath uh north america and
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:11.920]  and you know that's what creates earthquakes is fault lines and they go
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:14.800]  through cycles you know one of the other factors that contributes
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:18.720]  to some degree we don't really understand it is it a symptom or the cause
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:23.440]  but the magnetic field lines and the uh are shifting around quite a bit this
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:28.400]  happens about every 600 700 000 years that particular cycle
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:32.080]  um and at this time it's actually accelerating the magnetic
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:37.840]  a north pole is actually moving towards uh the former soviet now russia
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.120]  at an accelerating rate you know since they've been monitoring this activity
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:45.200]  but all those things indicate a whole lot happening
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:49.280]  uh within the earth at a particular um juncture in time and we're in the
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:52.880]  middle of it we're going to see a lot more of this you know back in the 90s
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:57.680]  we were predicting increases in climate uh and weather issues
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:02.000]  not so much because of of technology uh but because of what was happening in
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.480]  the normal cycles and our concern was man's technology now is that
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:11.200]  proverbial straw on the camel's back that throws things even further out of
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:14.880]  their equilibrium and and and it's already happening we don't need to be
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.960]  doing that we need to be learning but we don't
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.000]  need to be doing it that way
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:24.880]  okay ladies and gentlemen the great it team is stabilized info wars dot com

[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:20.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:24.080]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:27.120]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:30.960]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:34.160]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:38.080]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:31.920]  joined us last friday as he does every friday when the disaster was unfolding
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:35.200]  that first radiation leak that was whitewash
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:39.840]  friday has now reached the west coast as of this morning in los angeles but it's
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:43.360]  low radiation the issue is unfortunately but it's
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:47.120]  prepare for the worst you know hope for the best prepare for the worst
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:51.760]  the big blowouts happen saturday sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:56.080]  right through to today the japanese head of the plant has broken down and cried
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:59.040]  and said we're not going to cover this up anymore this is going to kill people
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:03.440]  this is deadly radiation it's blowing out towards us right now
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:07.040]  undoubtedly it's out of control partial meltdowns have been going on since last
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:10.160]  saturday 600 000 spin fuel rods stored on top of
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:15.120]  facilities blown sky high then big new developments on the issue with libya
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:19.040]  while we're busy watching this in the pacific with japan
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:22.640]  and the radiation cloud now the first fingers of it
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:26.640]  delicately touching the west coast and with the big punch behind it
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:30.480]  are multiple big punches behind it undoubtedly of the low radiation of
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:34.320]  friday god here can you imagine uh meanwhile obama's running around saying
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:38.400]  you don't need potassium iodate uh bizarre statements for man culture with a
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:43.120]  headline a glowing report on radiation uh she said uh anyone exposed excess
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:46.560]  radiation from the nuclear power plant is now probably much less likely to get
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:49.440]  cancer this is not a satire piece this is all
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:53.280]  part of their arrogance throwing it in our face obama's going to brazil
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:58.640]  for a week one day of his work uh hanging out with the ncaa basketball picks
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:04.400]  for hours one brief statement last friday uh about japan another brief
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.320]  statement yesterday sandwiched in with other bizarre statements
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:12.880]  um about basketball and things uh this is being done by design
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:15.520]  you're not going to see what happened with chernobyl this is clearly a clips
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:18.640]  that where they didn't let people for six months at least eat
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:22.800]  food produced in europe because it was radiated you're just going to be told
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:24.960]  everything's fine now we're going to talk about that with bob
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:28.960]  chapman and the huge new developments libya
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:32.480]  yesterday as you know 10 to 0 with five abstentions
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:35.680]  russia china and others just didn't vote they sat on the bench
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:41.920]  uh which is basically a a a yei vote um saying nothing is saying something uh
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:45.520]  to go in against qaddafi certainly a thug but the globalist
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:48.800]  are openly sending in british and u.s special forces weapons out of saudi
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:51.760]  arabia weapons out of egypt they thought they could beat him just with the
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:55.840]  rebel forces in the no fly announcement no fly now
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:59.280]  means a total bombardment of all of his military forces in the country
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:04.800]  uh and uh u.s fleet is moving in uh this is out of roiders
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:07.680]  us to deploy more ships to support libya planning
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:12.080]  that'll be the cruise missiles from the missile cruisers uh nato the british
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:15.920]  the french are openly saying they may start striking today they said that
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.160]  last night they haven't yet on his sights he immediately rolled over and
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:24.240]  said okay i want to ceasefire tell your al qaeda funded which is actually true
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:27.760]  out of saudi arabia groups to stop attacking and i'll stop shooting and
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:31.280]  they're like no they will attack you you will take it
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:34.960]  now again i i don't like qaddafi but this is a larger globalist program
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:38.720]  we'll get bob chapman's take on that destabilization program as well
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:42.240]  also new york fed confirms intervention and currency markets
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:44.640]  something chapman's been talking about for 20 years

[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:23.040]  game dot com jones report dot com uh also our facebook also our youtube we
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:27.360]  have a lot of auxiliary systems we're gonna go to dawn uh will jennifer
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:30.640]  mike it looks like dawn we talked to in two segments is still there
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.080]  we'll let uh have bob ask him a question see what bob wants to ask
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:38.320]  of somebody in japan but bob chapman first the nuclear
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:42.560]  holocaust now unfolding the japanese admitting there's been a cover up
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:45.600]  um because they know the deaths are now going to start coming out in the news
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:51.840]  what's your take on it well my big question is why didn't other nations
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:57.200]  particularly the united states china russia england
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:01.200]  why didn't they immediately come to the aid of these people
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:07.120]  bingo get that i think that's a key thing here because
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:13.280]  have they had could they have under the circumstances
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:17.840]  they might have been able to help um auxiliary electrical power
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:24.560]  auxiliary water why wasn't that done well now they're talking about doing it
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:28.880]  um that was a week ago well bob we know why they pulled out on saturday
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.240]  that's because the high radiation levels we now know we said that saturday but
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:35.680]  now it's confirmed but why haven't we seven days in had
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:38.640]  radiation meters from the giant pacific fleet
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:43.280]  the us trips at okinawa the us trips uh in around that area
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:47.280]  they've been covering up along with the japanese the real readings
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:50.320]  well they get their orders from the same source
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:58.000]  it's it's very disturbing uh from a human point of view people
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.080]  perhaps many of them dying needlessly
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:06.960]  they've been able to do something and now of course we've got a traveling
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:10.640]  through toward america and throughout the world
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:15.600]  i think you know you really but bob listen i'm going to have to put you on
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:18.720]  hold will you call us right back i know you're in the southern hemisphere
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:22.080]  lucky lucky dog you but uh reconnect with us we've
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:24.800]  got a very bad connection with bob Chapman i really
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:29.200]  want to get his take on all of this but bob Chapman will reconnect
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:33.440]  with genesis so we can continue to break down what's happening and yes we've
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.840]  been almost a hundred percent accurate in our forecasting of what's unfolded
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:40.800]  because we've studied past globalist playbooks
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:47.120]  and past meltdowns and uh i am unhappy very displeased that i've been
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:51.040]  correct i wish i was wrong you see i live in texas
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:54.160]  and it's scheduled to get here as well because the plumes going more southerly
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:57.760]  than what forecasters at first thought and will cross into where i live and i
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:00.720]  have children i love and the media will cover it up and it
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:04.240]  will increase cancer risk for my family and the globalist know it'll happen a
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:07.600]  decade 20 30 years down the road and so that's okay
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:11.120]  plausible deniability uh we will go to your phone calls
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:17.760]  dom anything you want to comment on on the cover-up now unraveling from japan
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:21.440]  well it's just kind of scary i mean i live here
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:25.040]  that's about all i want to say about that you know uh
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:28.800]  i might have to actually think about maybe moving back i don't know
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:33.520]  i have to talk to some more people i guess see what they're doing
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:36.480]  it's too bad i like it here i've been living here for like
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:40.480]  nine ten years you know
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:45.200]  are you there ellison yes sir uh they were popping in my ear telling me bob was
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:49.440]  back uh i mean it's crazy here i am ready or not
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:54.400]  uh uh uh was that a question at the end dom
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:16:00.560]  no not a question just a comment uh if if you have time i wouldn't mind just
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:06.640]  talking to one little thing about 911 if it's sure if it's okay
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:12.720]  uh you might want to talk about and tell your listeners about uh the map of
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:19.040]  bin laden's mountain fortress that you probably remember the uh meet the
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:23.840]  press program with donald rumsfeld and they held up this big map
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:27.760]  and said there isn't just one of those there's a whole bunch of those caves and
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:32.000]  you actually if if you go online you can actually know it's ridiculous it was
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  this giant tin story underground cobra commander
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:42.080]  fantasy base completely made up yeah yeah i'm sure you've seen the
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:47.680]  documentary the power of nightmares yes bbc and they found not even
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:52.000]  little caves in toro borough i mean it's just no it's like here's the super guy
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.920]  that did it he's got giant underground bases bigger than norad
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:59.520]  and give up all your rights or he'll suck your children's blood out with a
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:02.720]  with a straw bob Chapman i want to go back to the points you were making
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:08.480]  before your phone broke up but do you have any questions for dom in japan
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:13.760]  uh no i have had a a few reports from people who live there
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:20.080]  who are subscribers and um they were very uh i haven't had one
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:24.480]  so i'm not up to date on that but i you know the only thing that you hadn't
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:29.600]  said anything about in the last perhaps five to ten minutes prior to my
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:33.600]  coming on i heard and you covered it very well
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:37.520]  and the only thing i had was why didn't they get some help sooner
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:41.280]  absolutely thank you dom from japan we're gonna go to break soon go to
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:44.240]  back to will jennifer mike and others with bob Chapman but bob
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:48.000]  shifting gears into libya now a no fly zone
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.400]  is it means bombing a country no congressional declaration not even a
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:56.800]  congressional authorization just the u n now notice what's
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:18:00.800]  happening here the u n now in plain view
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:05.200]  is basically ordering nato in the u s in there uh this has never happened
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:08.160]  before i mean congress has nothing to say
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:13.920]  and uh now we're being told that a no fly means a bombardment of the country
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:17.200]  because it's wrong to strafe civilians but it turns out that was a lie
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:22.160]  turns out he didn't run to uh venezuela turns out he didn't run to south africa
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:26.080]  or zimbabwe i mean the point is i don't like qaddafi but they lie about
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:29.200]  everything it's about that oil what do you see happening what do you think is
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:34.000]  really going on in libya look at the background
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:41.680]  the evolutionary process of who really is in the qaddafi camp
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:46.960]  and if you go back into the 50s and 60s in particular
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:51.600]  you'll see that the british royal family
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:56.480]  has been a big sponsor of qaddafi for whatever reason
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:03.520]  and also uh there has been over the years special
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:09.600]  people who kind of at the beginning were allowed to go into libya
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:15.440]  and take oil out and of all those people if you can recall this
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:19.920]  was accidental petroleum which was arman hamah and
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:24.560]  i knew arman hamah because i was in his office was in la and
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:30.160]  other bridge business and he would come and sell convertible adventures and
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:35.600]  to do his drilling and raise funds and stay there tell us about arman hamah
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:40.240]  the communist uh controller of algor's father
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:44.640]  of course uh algor is one of the biggest owners of accidental petroleum
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:48.080]  uh and so he shuts down his competition so he makes more money stay there i want
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:51.120]  to look at the behind the scenes politics of libya
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:54.880]  who mark qaddafi knows where the bodies are buried what is the larger strategy
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:57.520]  him in removing him obviously their puppet cia
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:00.880]  and my six people couldn't beat him so now the bombs are coming

[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:36.000]  and the soviet union ceased to be the uh russian government told the world
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.960]  that almond hammer had been one of their
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:44.080]  many many many years so that to me tells me
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:51.200]  that's why the europeans made an arrangement uh with gadafi for him to
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:55.040]  be in their pumping oil because he was bodies with the russians now
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:58.960]  your phone cut out when you uh said that almond hammer came out was a russian
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:03.520]  agent uh yes it did uh after the fall of the
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:08.560]  wall and government changed in russia the russians came out and said that he
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:13.360]  was a long time agent of the russian government
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:17.600]  amazing i just want to that's why that's why he got what he got
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:22.960]  and the goers knew that these people that there's nothing political about this
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:26.960]  this is just one gang of criminals helping each other
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:32.480]  things have changed and so they want to make changes in the middle east
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:37.840]  and as you explain uh the rebels were incapable of taking him down
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:44.160]  he now realizes that and he's going to have to deal with us so he's backed off
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:48.000]  and some sort of a deal will probably be made
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.760]  what that deal will be i don't know well obama is basically now signaling that
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:57.600]  there is going to be an attack and they're moving
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:01.600]  us forces the united states will deploy additional amphibious ships
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:04.960]  to the Mediterranean the military said on friday as part of obama
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:08.720]  administration's plans for responding to ongoing violence in libya so
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:12.640]  now there's ever violence in a country we've got to invade it and pay for it
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:17.600]  the uss uh batan amphibious ready group by the way folks that's an invasion
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:21.680]  ship to put ground troops in will deploy
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:25.360]  march 23rd uh so it looks like they're getting ready to invade
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:29.920]  next week ahead of its original schedule in order to relieve units from the
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:33.360]  uss
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:37.920]  kerosars amphibious ready group currently positioned the Mediterranean
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:40.720]  sea it said in a statement the arriving group includes the amphibious
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:45.440]  assault ship uss batan based in virginia and other ships
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:50.720]  and uh it looks like they're going to go into libya
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:56.320]  and it looks like uh they're bringing in probably us marines
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:28:02.640]  and uh they probably are going to be met with
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:09.040]  qaddafi who will not attack them you know he has no hope of winning
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:13.200]  and so uh then it'll be an occupational situation
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:17.520]  and we'll have another iraq and afghanistan on our hands
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:22.960]  bob to interject before we go to break uh obama is saying if they don't accept
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:26.560]  un forces for humanitarian aid in their armored vehicles
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:30.960]  basically taking control of the country uh and that's what it is an occupation
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:35.920]  under the name of humanitarian assistance uh that they will invade with
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:41.040]  military force so he's now been clear on that front so accept
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:45.200]  occupation give up let the assistance come in
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:51.520]  or uh we will uh uh bombard you and basically invade you i mean this is
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:55.600]  incredible and this all came from a un directive
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:59.760]  here's the u.s basically following the un's orders
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:03.520]  which means that the part of the united states
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:06.320]  and the president has nothing to say about anything
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:11.040]  the un is now making those decisions so we live under a one-world government
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:16.080]  not the united states government or any other sovereign government
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:20.480]  well this is just incredible um we're going to come back and get into the
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:24.000]  economy get more into the earthquake get into new york fed confirms
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.240]  intervention and currency markets uh if bob's phone continues to break up we'll
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:30.480]  let him finish up on these topics and then have him leave us
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:34.240]  unfortunately it is breaking up the worst it ever has he is not in the

[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:05.840]  threat from a growing force of advanced western aircraft and missiles
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:09.440]  intended to reverse the balance of power in the north african conflict so this
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:12.480]  is a direct overthrow nothing to do with humanitarian issues the
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:14.880]  globalists could care less they rather dictators
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:18.400]  that they control and power the north atlantic treaty organization members
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:22.640]  britain france denmark spain and canada along with the u.s and pledge plans
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:27.040]  uh to a uh and planes to a mission over libya according to government
[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:30.800]  statements and press reports and they're moving amphibious invasionships in
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:34.560]  and qatar said it would participate in the plan the us's is
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:40.960]  deploying the torrentado a b a e systems uh euro fighter typhoon jets
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:45.760]  french foreign minister alan jupy commented on military action told
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:51.040]  reporters in paris we are ready but i can't provide a precise timetable
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:56.880]  so uh this is really bit really another war the roiders reporting
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:01.920]  us heads towards risky libya engagement the united states move towards
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:04.960]  potentially deep and risky engagement in libya's bloody
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:09.360]  political crisis uh friday valing to remove defiant leader muhamar qaddafi
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:11.840]  and halt violence against him battle rebels
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:15.520]  we don't know what the final outcome will be the first and overwhelmingly
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:18.800]  urgent action is to end the violence oh they care so much
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:22.800]  about that remember they've lied about him going to venezuela they lied about
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:26.800]  him fleeing to zimbabwe they lied about him strafing people that was later
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:30.800]  confirmed he strafed rebels i'm not saying that's good i don't like qaddafi
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:34.800]  the point is it's all hypocritical lies were being given
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:41.440]  um bob chatman um libya's declared a cease fire saying okay rebels don't shoot
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:45.280]  at us we won't shoot at you and uh obama's come out and say it doesn't matter
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.160]  now you accept a quote peaceful takeover invasion in on humanitarian grounds
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:53.840]  or we're going to blow the daylights out of you bob chatman
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.560]  and that's exactly what's going on and um i think
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:03.360]  they as i said several weeks ago the people who started off all the
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:08.800]  going the ciam i6 and the misad uh i think i made a big mistake
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:14.160]  uh they made some of the changes they wanted but they had to use violence
[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:20.480]  in libya uh and also in barrain to a great extent i saw
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:28.000]  movies yesterday of military people shooting civilians out of hand
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.880]  i mean i've never seen anything like that before
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:36.720]  i mean just murder assassination yeah saudi arabia shooting people uh barrain
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:41.200]  is shooting people but when they do it's loving and good and caring
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:47.520]  okay well i think this is going to continue and not
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:51.280]  in a way that they like and uh they're going to have more
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:56.640]  problems along the way and uh people who are investors
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:00.400]  throughout the world now think that things are going to get better
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:04.400]  in japan as well as the middle east and that certainly isn't the case
[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:09.600]  bob and you now go ahead yes now your phone's just breaking up
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:13.040]  clinton says you in resolution on libya only
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:16.880]  one step and they're saying we are going to be
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:22.880]  not responsive or impressed by words uh we would have to see actions on the
[02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:27.040]  ground and that is not yet at all clear clinton said to reporters
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:30.720]  at a meeting uh with iran's deputy prime minister
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:33.440]  we will continue to work with our partners international community to press
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:37.280]  kadovi to leave and to support the legitimate aspirations of the libyan
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:42.160]  people she said so what this says is when rebels that are openly financed by the
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:45.680]  west try to overthrow countries if they're not successful
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:49.120]  the nato slash us forces are going to invade
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:53.280]  that will spur other rebel groups to start new wars is this not a global
[02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:59.840]  destabilization program and why and now that you mention it the answer is yes
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:06.480]  why to divert attention away from a financial system that's collapsing
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:10.720]  and the only way it can be kept afloat is by
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:14.080]  quantitative easing stimulus from governments
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:17.440]  and it's not just the united states it's a number of nations particularly
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:21.760]  europe and england and if they stop that
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:25.600]  assistance all things are gonna collapse so they want to take that out of the
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:29.120]  news and i explained this several weeks ago when this started
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:33.440]  that i thought it was a disinformation move
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:38.320]  along with other things in the middle east and now of course japan's popped up
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:43.440]  uh but you would think that people in the markets
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:46.720]  would not be buyers they'd be sellers yes it was some selling
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:50.160]  the doubt went down about 500 points but it's going right back up again
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:54.160]  all right bob because obviously they get information that we don't have
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:57.920]  bob uh you're here every friday with us in the last hour
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:01.120]  uh but your phone again we've tried three times is so bad today and we're
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:04.560]  going to end this interview in a moment but i wanted to finish up with one of
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:08.640]  the issues that you've been writing about for
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:12.640]  close to 50 years and that is the private federal reserve manipulating the
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:15.840]  currency market something they've always denied
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:19.840]  but now here's the ap today new york fed confirms intervention in currency
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:22.480]  markets they're doing more than that the stock market as you know with the
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:25.680]  plunge protection team the new york federal reserve
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:28.160]  confirmed that it intervened in currency markets
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:33.520]  today for the first time in more than a decade the disclosure came a day after
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:36.480]  the group of seven major industrial nations pledged
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:40.880]  in a statement to join an accorded effort to weaken the japanese yen
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:45.040]  the yen has surged in the past week to post war record levels
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:48.560]  following the japanese earthquake and tsunami we also see an acceleration of
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:52.480]  the fed monetizing debt we also see some of the biggest
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:55.200]  brokerage firms in the world saying they're no longer going to buy dollars
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:59.040]  or t bills briefly tell us what this signifies
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:03.120]  and uh where you see gold and silver going
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:08.480]  well first of all we have the japanese prior to the end of the month
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:14.480]  evening up their books and that causes the yen to go higher as they
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:19.040]  sell foreign securities or of some kind of foreign currencies
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:22.640]  to bring the money home for their balance sheets
[02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:26.800]  and this has happened at the worst possible time
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:31.040]  there are a number of people are in the yen carry trade
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:34.160]  i can't go into that because we don't have time
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:39.600]  and it's too intricate but what it means is the people who have borrowed yen
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:44.960]  to go out and buy other things that the end converted into say
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:49.440]  dollars or pounds or whatever they get in their heads handed to them
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:53.280]  and that's one of the reasons they want to stabilize it who is they
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:57.840]  usually the banks hedge funds etc they're very highly leveraged and what's one
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:02.880]  of the ways they do it so that's why the g7 really did what they did
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:07.200]  say the people who had been speculating and using the yen
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:13.280]  as the basis to do that uh what's going to happen to golden silver
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:18.560]  over and over again alex these charters and waivers
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:23.440]  and uh cyclists have been telling us for five years
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:27.280]  that the markets in golden server are going to correct correct
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:32.960]  from here to there from here to there etc etc and it never happens
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:37.920]  what's happened is all of these things coming together
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:41.280]  especially with the federal reserve are going to create
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:45.040]  much more inflation so the numbers that came out yesterday
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:49.680]  devastating will be 14 percent easy by the end of the year
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:54.320]  in inflation and they know that and that's why gold and silver
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:42:00.320]  are getting an extra push upward because they react in a positive manner
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:04.720]  to set to currencies being degraded the dollar in this case
[02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:09.200]  among others so what's going to happen is gold and silver
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:13.360]  are going to move strongly upward which is an opposition
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:17.360]  to what 96 6 percent of newsletter writers are saying
[02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:22.000]  because they're using charts etc to make their decisions
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:27.040]  and you can't do that because the government is rigging the market
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:30.640]  through the plunge protection team and what this group on financial markets
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.640]  and what this shows is that it's a rig casino uh folks the international

[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:06.560]  the full hour but his phone as you could hear was just completely hammered and

[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:14.080]  call back with a better connection but it didn't work he's in south america
[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:18.240]  let's go ahead and go to your phone calls will jennifer shon mike
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:23.280]  i'm going to get to you but first david in japan sir how are you holding up
[02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:27.360]  there and well things are going okay to be
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:30.720]  honest um when i listen to your your sunday show and
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:36.000]  looking at the other information as well uh myself and uh my wife decided to
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  leave where we were we were in campsite but we went to okinawa which is the
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.120]  the southernmost island
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:49.680]  but um but uh just seeing the news there's some there's some more information
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:53.040]  that hasn't really come out in the western media that i wanted to mention
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:58.240]  uh particularly on monday in the news it was reported that the the prime minister
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:02.880]  kan was overheard arguing with the uh this actually came out on the
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:06.240]  television he was he was overheard arguing with the
[02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:11.280]  um the tokyo electric company persons and at first the tokyo electric
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:15.200]  employees uh were going to completely abandon the plant and not take any
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:18.240]  action whatsoever uh because of the radioactivity
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:22.480]  level and then kan was heard shouting at them saying
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:28.160]  we could lose western japan um if you don't do something
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:33.280]  and uh sorry uh eastern japan he said we could lose eastern japan if you don't
[02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:36.160]  that's what my dad said i mean there are many areas of ukraine that are
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:40.080]  uninhabitable this could take a large area of northeastern japan
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:43.520]  and make it uninhabitable and if they completely melt down it could completely
[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:47.520]  radiate tokyo with 37 million people and now the head of the plant
[02:44:47.520 --> 02:44:51.120]  has broken down and cried and admitted basically a cover-up and said it is
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:55.040]  highly radioactive enough to kill people and broke down crying how are the
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:59.120]  japanese responding to that well you see it's it's the way it's
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:02.800]  being covered in the media here it's it's difficult to understand
[02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:06.560]  because the awareness of of nuclear energy and the
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:11.360]  the the um how dangerous it is is probably
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:16.080]  higher abroad in japan and the media here they're giving out a lot of technical
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:19.280]  information but i think most of the ordinary
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:23.520]  people really don't understand the implications of what they're being told
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:26.080]  they're just like they're giving the technical information but they're still
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:30.080]  saying it's not a permanent problem for human health or
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:34.800]  it's this could be terrible but then they don't say exactly what it is so
[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:38.480]  the japanese people i think are more focused on the
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:43.040]  the comprehensible human aspects of the of the tragedy which are still the
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:45.920]  the death due to the tsunami and the difficulty of the
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:50.800]  a lot of the how the people are trying to survive in the the relocation
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:55.040]  areas that have been evacuated you know they're focusing on the difficulty of
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:58.160]  their life in terms of they don't have food or
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:03.840]  the more more ordinary human problems
[02:46:04.800 --> 02:46:10.080]  uh what what is the press reporting the radiation levels are there
[02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:16.480]  um they uh well it varies the the information they're giving out is
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:20.240]  it's different but they just they just uh on the news just a short while ago
[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:23.920]  they said that the the token electric decided that
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:29.360]  it was acceptable for their employees to be exposed to 250 millisieverts
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:33.360]  while working which is uh is basically a a change in
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:39.360]  japanese regulation or law um so that's a that's a pretty big thing
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:43.440]  well we've got to pray for those valiant souls the Fukushima 50
[02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:49.840]  that rotate in groups of about 188 people in in groups of 50 rotating in
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:53.440]  uh because they are pointing out that this radiation can kill the people
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:56.480]  there uh are the japanese concerned about the news
[02:46:56.480 --> 02:47:00.880]  or is it being played big in your press uh it's in the u.s press that
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:04.240]  the meteorologists are predicting in the next 48 hours the wind is going to
[02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:11.040]  turn towards the south again and they're they they they mentioned it briefly
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:14.560]  but they haven't they haven't really mentioned the implications of what
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:21.600]  what that means and people are they're i mean i think
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:26.000]  there's a there's a bit of a rift in in society and how people are reacting
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.600]  because i look on the internet and young people who are more
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:34.000]  uh news savvy are like sending messages to each other on the message board
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:38.560]  saying uh i've already run away i'm in uh i'm uh i'm in west
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:41.120]  in japan i've gone to this prefecture and stuff
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:44.320]  but the the older generation who would just get the news from television or
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:50.240]  whatever are more slightly uh they're not really aware of
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:53.920]  what really is happening yeah they're in that television induced
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:58.240]  trance uh david anything else you'd like to add from japan
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:01.120]  well just on some of the larger trends that were happening
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:05.120]  and before this disaster happened this disaster i think is just
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:09.360]  it's totally it's completely changed japan's
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:14.720]  future and the path they're on because this is my own observation
[02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:18.320]  but in the japanese media before this disaster there was
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:25.520]  there was a lot of uh uh media pointing towards like a new national
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:29.280]  fervor there was a there was a television drama
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:32.880]  new optimism new optimism was back and you're saying
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:36.800]  after the decade-long recession you're saying this may may knock that on the
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:41.120]  head well for well specifically just before this
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:45.440]  disaster happened there was a quote from kevin maher the policy chief on affairs
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:48.960]  at the u.s state department and he said this is the quote
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:54.000]  it would be bad for the u.s if japan's war renouncing peaceful constitution was
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:57.760]  changed because japan would not need the american military
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:00.640]  and then he went that's right they were getting a little more militaristic as a
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:05.680]  china and north korea are you saying that this is suspicious
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:09.680]  i don't know because i we do i'm not i'm a scientist and
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:13.120]  well david david very well said and we appreciate your call from japan we're
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:16.800]  going to move on now thank you so much for calling will in new york will you're
[02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:21.760]  on the air i i got a question i really want to
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:24.880]  answer but first i just want to point out a couple small things
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.160]  for anyone on the east coast who knows that nine eleven was an inside job
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:31.680]  tomorrow in washington dc there's going to be an anti-war protest
[02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:34.080]  so i suggest that people if they can make it down
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:38.800]  i'll head down there and talk about okay and also also uh shoemaker levy hit
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:42.000]  jupiter i just wanted to point that out to put her sat or whatever the big
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:45.520]  comment that hit the gas giant i'm live here on air i say a lot of stuff wrong
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:48.320]  sometimes getting it backwards but the point is the earth gets hit by more
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:52.800]  big objects than what they previously thought on a more frequent basis
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:57.760]  i did no i just want you know whatever uh but no thanks for correcting me
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:01.440]  i wanted to uh i wanted to ask you i know you you say you don't like to get into
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:04.800]  alien stuff uh but how how do you feel about
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:09.120]  what jim marz said about the reason for invading iraq he thinks
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:13.760]  is uh to get at these ancient like tablets that have to do with like well we
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:17.600]  know that that was an added goody to to to rob the antiquities i appreciate your
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:20.400]  call you know i i just don't get into things i can't
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:23.920]  prove one way or the other uh aliens and things are really not my purview
[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:27.280]  i mean i can't get folks to admit that radiation is bad for a man colter saying
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:33.200]  it's good for you today i mean i'm not joking folks uh so
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:37.120]  my point is is that now they can study jupiter sat or other planets and they
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:40.400]  know that more meteors and and comets hit planets on a more
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:44.400]  frequent basis than they thought uh and i will we'll look up shoemaker levy a
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:47.440]  little bit later but uh the point is i get live on air and talk for three four
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:50.240]  hours a day sometimes i get things wrong uh but thank you for correcting me
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:53.360]  all right i'm gonna try to jam in uh jennifer shan mike daniel
[02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:56.560]  daniel in australia on the other side we'll go a little bit into overdrive in
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:51:00.320]  the next hour have a key announcement as well dealing with potassium iodine on
[02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:03.360]  the other side the collapse of the dollar is imminent
[02:51:03.360 --> 02:51:07.520]  you can protect your wealth by buying gold silver and strong foreign currencies
[02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:11.600]  but what if the government confiscates your precious metals implements exchange
[02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:16.160]  controls or nationalizes your retirement you need a backup plan that's why you

[02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:11.200]  driving to the fourth hour so i can get to
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:15.520]  daniel jennifer shawn mike and fred one program note
[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:19.840]  i began looking for potassium iodine the medical type
[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:25.680]  for my crew for my extended family uh because the stuff i had was the regular
[02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:29.840]  tablets and was expired uh though they my consultant was the
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:32.160]  physicians they said it should still probably be good
[02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:36.000]  and i found a place in texas i've known about for 12 years and interviewed
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:39.280]  uh place that calibrates for the government the geiger counters and the
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:43.360]  rest of it who had a limited supply we bought everything they had left
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:46.160]  i don't think it'll probably be there in four or five hours it's selling that
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:50.400]  fast the main shopping cart is basically down
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:53.200]  people are trying to order on and some of that's going through
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:56.560]  uh you need to go to our yahoo backup cart
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:55:01.440]  that's linked in the article up on info wars dot com you want to go to our old
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:05.280]  shopping cart in the article at info wars dot com
[02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:08.800]  where we uh the title info wars is as obtained
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:12.880]  some of the only potassium iodine left in the country we've added a link there
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:16.640]  to the yahoo cart or at the top of info wars dot com where it says shopping
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:20.880]  it'll say new cart and it'll say classic cart click on the classic cart
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:25.040]  if you want to be able to get it but it might be gone in an hour or two
[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:28.320]  and i wish there was more we've also gotten some radiation detectors but i
[02:55:28.320 --> 02:55:30.320]  could only afford to get a hundred of them
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:34.480]  um and so those are available and selling out quickly the nuke detectors
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:37.280]  because we know they're covering up what's happening we hope most of it goes
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:40.240]  into the ocean but this thing's going into multiple meltdown
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:44.480]  the question is how bad has it been and so obviously folks were asking us to
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:49.040]  find a source of this and we did info wars dot com you can't call here and
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:52.160]  get it folks we only got two people that work here doing customer service and
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:56.000]  the phones are just jammed we can't take orders that way info wars
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:00.160]  dot com and yes the the listener was right when i'm babbling about comets
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:02.480]  hitting planets more often than they thought and things
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:05.840]  it was not saturn it was jupiter that was hit by uh
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:09.920]  comet shoemaker levy that's the folks that found it uh in blue holes on the
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:12.560]  side of the gas giant bigger than the planet earth
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:16.160]  so that was the point i made uh earlier about big calamities happening in the
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:18.880]  solar system more often than scientists previously thought
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:21.600]  uh let's go now that they can watch the solar system and see what's happening
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:25.200]  and what's floating around out there um let's go to daniel and we got to move
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:28.080]  quick now daniel in australia go ahead
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:34.320]  hi alex how are you good thanks very much for helping keep us informed
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:38.480]  thank you we're getting massive conflicting reports from the media
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:41.440]  the japanese i lived over there for some time and
[02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:45.920]  i can speak your language so i'm understanding the news reports there
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:49.040]  they sort of they communicate between the lines now
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:52.960]  they aren't letting us know what's going on as well as telling us that it's all
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:56.240]  okay yeah they're saying the radiation is so high it can kill you but everything's
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:57:00.880]  fine that's right that the japanese prime minister
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:05.600]  uh kahn he he'll come up and he'll say that it's it's gotten
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:10.000]  terrible after the last you know day it's as bad as it can get but it's just
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.360]  getting better it's just gotten better every
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:15.920]  time he speaks
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:20.400]  well i mean i mean do you blame them there's third i'm not saying it's good
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:23.440]  what they're doing but 37 million people in tokyo
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:27.840]  as the winds turn south is there reported to uh be forecast to do
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:34.880]  can you imagine what a panic could do yeah look for those who who are aware of
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:38.400]  of what's going on and keep themselves informed that they're giving enough
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:41.840]  information for people to know and um they're pretty much
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:44.560]  killing people to get out of our foreign minister
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:49.280]  has been uh he hasn't been silent on the subject but just recently he said look
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:53.520]  the conflicting reports have gotten too much and and get out
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:58.400]  basically that is what they're saying and now they've
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:03.040]  had the head of the plant break down and cry and say it's deadly it's deadly
[02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:07.040]  that is certainly probably not going to increase confidence on the island of
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:09.200]  japan of course some of that stuff's going
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:14.640]  southerly towards your country what what is your media saying in australia
[02:58:14.640 --> 02:58:19.840]  oh i don't think it's a real threat for us i think you guys are in the full
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:23.200]  answer of whatever there's no doubt we're in a worse

[03:00:19.920 --> 03:00:22.800]  stations all over the country but let's move quickly to some final
[03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:26.320]  calls jennifer in colorado and then uh shon mike and freddy we have time
[03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:29.520]  jennifer you've got the floor quickly
[03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:33.760]  thank you alex for everything you do um we have been Denver colorado
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:37.680]  and we were just wondering will there walking mountains provide any protection
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:41.600]  for us what the radiation has come in this way i'm not a meteorologist but i've
[03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:45.040]  studied what they said but undoubtedly yes it'll be a lot more diluted
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:48.880]  and statistically a lower chance of not just the background radiation but when
[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:52.400]  you actually get one of the particles itself it's higher level radiation
[03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:57.280]  you know it lowers that chance of inhalation okay and one other question
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:01.120]  uh what are the immediate warning signs we should be looking for right before
[03:01:01.120 --> 03:01:04.640]  they claim martial law they'll never really declare martial law they'll
[03:01:04.640 --> 03:01:08.560]  call it a civil emergency michigan declared financial martial law which
[03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:14.720]  means suspension of normal laws and under the executive orders under the tsa
[03:01:14.720 --> 03:01:18.160]  not caring what congress says the epa not caring what congress says shutting
[03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:21.360]  down coal plants that's all executive fiat
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:27.520]  martial law so it's a slow slide into uh the just civil emergency national
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:31.200]  security state jennifer okay thank you so much alex
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:33.840]  thank you jennifer yeah look at all these other third world countries it's
[03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:36.640]  always an emergency a civil emergency they don't call it martial law people
[03:01:36.640 --> 03:01:40.000]  are like alex where's the martial law i don't know the tsa is running check
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.880]  points on highways everywhere i don't know they're putting troops on the
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:45.760]  streets more and more they're sticking their hands down your pants
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:50.080]  i don't know they're suspending uh regular laws on your pension funds and
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:53.360]  things i mean what do you think that is uh let's go
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:58.160]  ahead and talk to shawn in canada shawn you're on the air
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:02.720]  hello alex can you hear me yes sir well okay well i have some information
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:06.640]  concerning the uh pickering nuclear power plant had a leak uh just a few
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:10.400]  days ago there into lake ontario yep they admit it a lot of radiation got
[03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:13.920]  released and they and they say it's not bad for you yep
[03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:18.080]  absolutely yeah they um the radioactive uh it was called tritium that was in the
[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:21.520]  water that was released about 73 000 liters was put into lake
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:26.240]  ontario as we both know we share 50 50 pretty much with america
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:30.880]  um now the half-life of tritium is about 12 years in the human body it's about
[03:02:30.880 --> 03:02:34.960]  seven to 14 days according to this um what's interesting actually is the
[03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:38.240]  legal limits uh let's talk about uh we talk about cover-ups and think about
[03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:42.160]  how people sort of spin news um the canadian legal limit
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:46.080]  for tritium in drinking water is 7 000 becquerel
[03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:51.440]  per liter so that's the radioactive uh rating per liter of the water uh while
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:55.760]  the united states is only 740 that's the difference of over 6 000
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:58.560]  becquerel per liter yeah the government just says this
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:03.840]  radiation isn't bad for you and em colter says it's good for you
[03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:08.000]  it's good for you yeah right no i'm not kidding show a document cam shot
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:12.560]  sorry go ahead the um the world health organization puts it at 10 000
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:17.040]  becquerel per liter while uh the european union has an
[03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:20.640]  investigative limit of only 100 becquerel per liter
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:23.600]  doesn't see a great discrepancy there i thought i would bring that up because
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:26.640]  no you're right and notice how it's not getting hardly any play and this is a
[03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:30.320]  major radiation release and they're caught covering this up at plants all
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:33.440]  the time that's why i'm so adverse more and more to
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:38.560]  nuclear power as we learn more uh but don't worry and colter is now a i
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:42.960]  guess a nuclear physicist and a chemist and a biologist and she says a glowing
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:46.320]  report on radiation anyone exposed to excess radiation from the
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:50.240]  nuclear power plants is now probably much less likely to get cancer
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:52.960]  really the japanese government's having to break down and people are breaking
[03:03:52.960 --> 03:03:56.880]  down crying saying it's killing people and gonna kill people but maybe to her
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:00.400]  death is good i mean i i appreciate your call sir and i'm not even here to bash
[03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:05.680]  and colter i don't even care she you know she says ron paul's good but but but
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:10.400]  is a blind hog you know still finds acorns i mean i'm just insulted by this
[03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:15.200]  it's not a joke man and the cynicism of the liberals the cynicism of mainline
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:18.880]  republicans and just the giggling and snickering and not taking things
[03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:22.240]  serious radiation's now been detected to southern
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:25.600]  california just from the small leaks friday
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:30.000]  that stuff just got here today all those big explosions and plumes
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:33.840]  if the little stuff from friday got here what's going to happen in the next five
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:37.600]  six days and after that is this just continues
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:41.520]  this i mean they're in the mainline news it's up on drudgereport.com info
[03:04:41.520 --> 03:04:45.040]  wars.com la times you name it saying maybe just pull
[03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:47.520]  the workers out entirely because it's so deadly
[03:04:47.520 --> 03:04:52.320]  and just let the whole thing continue to melt down and smoke stack towards us
[03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:55.120]  and the media a lot of them just laugh and think it's funny
