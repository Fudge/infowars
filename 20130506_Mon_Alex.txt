[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:33.680]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.680 --> 00:39.880]  If you've got a business, you didn't do that. You didn't build that. Somebody else made
[00:39.880 --> 00:48.000]  that possible. Yes, I'm quoting Barack H. Obama, and now he's back throwing it in everyone's
[00:48.000 --> 00:49.000]  face.
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.280]  As soon as I got off the air yesterday, I looked up at DrudgeReport.com with horror
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.960]  because it just shows how arrogant Obama has gotten. And there was the Real Clear Politics
[01:01.960 --> 01:08.520]  video of Obama yesterday that had just gone up. I saw it when it had like 30, 40 views
[01:08.520 --> 01:15.120]  right when it had gone live. And there was Obama right when I got off at six o'clock
[01:15.120 --> 01:21.320]  yesterday at a commencement speech at a major university saying that we shouldn't think
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.360]  of government as something that's dangerous and filled with tyranny.
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.820]  Of course, it was George Washington that famously said that government is like fire, a dangerous
[01:31.820 --> 01:38.440]  servant and a fearful master. It was Ronald Reagan that said, the nine most terrifying
[01:38.440 --> 01:45.800]  words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help you. And
[01:45.800 --> 01:50.200]  another one, in this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problems. Government
[01:50.200 --> 01:52.160]  is the problem.
[01:52.160 --> 01:59.360]  Let's play a clip of Ronald Reagan from 1981 with those famous words. Here it is.
[01:59.360 --> 02:06.200]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is
[02:06.200 --> 02:11.420]  the problem. From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become
[02:11.420 --> 02:18.680]  too complex to be managed by self-rule. That government by an elite group is superior to
[02:18.680 --> 02:24.360]  government for, by, and of the people.
[02:24.360 --> 02:30.000]  That was the central idea that won Reagan the presidency, a warning he had sounded consistently
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.120]  for years. You can hear it here in the speech that launched his political career.
[02:36.120 --> 02:40.840]  This is the issue of this election. Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government
[02:40.840 --> 02:45.840]  or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite
[02:45.840 --> 02:51.480]  in a far distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.
[02:51.480 --> 02:56.860]  This was Ronald Reagan's debut as the great communicator, the nationally televised speech
[02:56.860 --> 03:03.240]  for Barry Goldwater that put him on the political map back in 1964. In fact, it was a speech
[03:03.240 --> 03:05.760]  he had been perfecting for a good-
[03:05.760 --> 03:09.960]  Okay, by the way, tonight on the Nightly News, I'm gonna get some Ronald Reagan clips. I'm
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.320]  gonna host the news live tonight, by the way, seven o'clock central. I'm gonna get some
[03:14.320 --> 03:19.800]  clips of Reagan and Ron Paul and others versus Obama. And you can say what you want about
[03:19.800 --> 03:21.640]  Reagan, what he actually did.
[03:21.640 --> 03:26.440]  The special interests got out of control and government got bigger. But at least the rhetoric
[03:26.440 --> 03:31.880]  was good. With Obama, I mean, you've got a guy making sure that billionaires don't have
[03:31.880 --> 03:35.900]  to pay taxes while lobbying to have people that make a couple hundred thousand dollars
[03:35.900 --> 03:37.600]  a year to pay more taxes.
[03:37.600 --> 03:41.480]  Why do you have billionaires lobbying for that? Because most of them, like Warren Buffett,
[03:41.480 --> 03:45.740]  make their money out of government bailouts. I have an article here where profits were
[03:45.740 --> 03:53.120]  up 49% for Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett. And then they admit in the article, like it's
[03:53.120 --> 03:58.920]  no big deal that, by the way, Warren Buffett got most of that off derivatives that were
[03:58.920 --> 04:01.340]  propped up with taxpayer money.
[04:01.340 --> 04:07.680]  Of course, that pig, that anti-gun globalist eugenicist, Billa Melinda Gates, number one
[04:07.680 --> 04:14.160]  Obama supporter. Of course, that pig blocked the Keystone Pipeline to bring oil into Texas
[04:14.160 --> 04:19.380]  for the whole US out of Canada. Because he owns the trains that are gonna now bring it
[04:19.380 --> 04:23.440]  via tanker to the West Coast and put them on supertankers to China.
[04:23.440 --> 04:28.240]  These people are doing everything they can to shut America down while making giant profits
[04:28.240 --> 04:35.040]  out of a controlled monopoly. What's Atlas Shrugged all about? It's about where ultra-rich
[04:35.040 --> 04:43.280]  use government to shut down their competition. I mean, crony capitalism is the plague, is
[04:43.280 --> 04:49.040]  the enemy. And now we've got Obama at a sports stadium full of young people saying government
[04:49.040 --> 04:55.360]  is not tyranny. Government is our sweetie cake. Government will now take care of us.
[04:55.360 --> 05:00.240]  Yeah, it'll take care of you. I mean, unbelievable.

[08:26.240 --> 08:40.000]  Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. It is Monday, the sixth
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.880]  day of May, two thousand and thirteen. We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[08:46.880 --> 08:53.320]  Lou Rockwell, the head of the Von Mies Institute, is going to be joining us to track the incredible
[08:53.320 --> 08:59.600]  world events with gold, with the dollar, with the EU gyrating out of control, plunging into
[08:59.600 --> 09:04.840]  an authoritarian death spiral. That's the creator of the euro is now saying that, saying
[09:04.840 --> 09:10.160]  that it's going to totally collapse into a tyranny. Ron Paul and others talking about
[09:10.160 --> 09:15.240]  Europe collapsing as well. Ron Paul is in Europe right now. We've got some clips of
[09:15.240 --> 09:16.240]  that.
[09:16.240 --> 09:22.400]  We've got the unprecedented spectacle of a twenty seven, twenty eight month war against
[09:22.400 --> 09:30.480]  Syria using al Qaeda jihadis now culminating with Israel bombing chicken farms, military
[09:30.480 --> 09:38.500]  installations, bridges, chemical plants. And Syria is there laying down and taking it.
[09:38.500 --> 09:44.840]  And the media is denouncing Syria as warmongers and saying they deserve to be absolutely carpet
[09:44.840 --> 09:54.080]  bombed for doing nothing. And Israel is publicly siding with NATO and, of course, al Qaeda
[09:54.080 --> 09:56.200]  in those operations.
[09:56.200 --> 10:02.680]  Syria says that Israel airstrikes risk a wider conflict. They're blowing up military barracks,
[10:02.680 --> 10:10.000]  you name it, desperately trying to get a response. And then if Syria responds, the news will
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.360]  say that Syria has preemptively and premeditatedly started the war first. And we'll go, wait
[10:16.360 --> 10:21.360]  a minute, for over two years, the West has been attacking them, including a NATO backed
[10:21.360 --> 10:26.240]  Turkey with with three day long artillery barrages.
[10:26.240 --> 10:33.120]  It doesn't matter. That's how dumbed down the public is. All they know is their foreigners
[10:33.120 --> 10:39.920]  shall kill them. That's all they know. You've got the neo cons giving Obama right cover
[10:39.920 --> 10:45.920]  saying how dare you not be tough on Syria when Obama has been able to attack Libya,
[10:45.920 --> 10:52.880]  Syria, overthrow Egypt and put all these globalists in power. I mean, this is hardcore what's
[10:52.880 --> 10:53.880]  happening.
[10:53.880 --> 10:57.840]  So we're gonna be looking at that as well. Also, I have announced and I do plan to go
[10:57.840 --> 11:05.760]  to Bilderberg 2013 in England. Over 130 people are blocked from entering England. Basically,
[11:05.760 --> 11:10.720]  they mix in a lot of patriots in with real terrorist groups and others.
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.480]  Michael Savage has been banned from going into the country. I don't know if they're
[11:14.480 --> 11:19.120]  gonna ban me. I've been to England before. But if they do, that will just become a media
[11:19.120 --> 11:24.020]  event as well. I would rather actually get over there, cover it. People are always asking
[11:24.020 --> 11:27.020]  me to go to England. We're very popular in England.
[11:27.020 --> 11:30.920]  And I like to cover Bilderberg. I like to ferret out information. I do intend to go
[11:30.920 --> 11:36.040]  over there. Alex Jones calls on World Press to cover Bilderberg 2013. You can see my thoughts
[11:36.040 --> 11:42.240]  and points that I made with Paul Watson via infowars.com and prisonplanted.com if you
[11:42.240 --> 11:46.880]  wanna see that article and some of the photos and information there, but I'll be covering
[11:46.880 --> 11:49.680]  that more later in the broadcast.
[11:49.680 --> 11:55.920]  But Israel's launching more. They're down to two days of airstrikes on Syria. This is
[11:55.920 --> 12:02.280]  just incredible. Syria attacked no one. Syria has tried to work with the West. Assad was
[12:02.280 --> 12:08.360]  basically raised in England. He's been trying to work with the West, trying to make peace
[12:08.360 --> 12:13.000]  deals. And the answer is no, you're gonna be overthrown. And Al-Qaeda is gonna be put
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.800]  in charge and they're gonna ethically cleanse the Christians, the Jews, and minority Muslim
[12:19.800 --> 12:20.800]  groups.
[12:20.800 --> 12:26.120]  Syria will choose the moment to hit back. UN accuses Syrian rebels of carrying out sarin
[12:26.120 --> 12:30.240]  gas attacks, which have been blamed on Assad troops. And again, I don't ever think the
[12:30.240 --> 12:34.800]  UN's a good organization. It plays the left cover side, created by the Rockefellers. But
[12:34.800 --> 12:43.100]  the truth is, the Al-Qaeda rebels a year ago videotaped themselves testing nerve gas and
[12:43.100 --> 12:45.520]  saying they would use it against Assad.
[12:45.520 --> 12:51.240]  They've been trying to get into their bases to get a hold of it. And then Israel says
[12:51.240 --> 12:59.100]  whether the Al-Qaeda rebels get the nerve gas or whether Syrian government uses it,
[12:59.100 --> 13:06.320]  they're gonna strike them because of it. I mean, Israel can't support NATO, the US, France,
[13:06.320 --> 13:12.720]  and Germany, and England, the UK, in a two plus year covert war.
[13:12.720 --> 13:18.520]  Now Obama announced heavy weapons to be given. And what did they list? Heat seeking missiles.
[13:18.520 --> 13:23.820]  They've already given them the heat seeking missiles. And on the cover of the BBC website,
[13:23.820 --> 13:30.260]  they showed a jihadi with a heat seeking missile launcher on his shoulder that can shoot things
[13:30.260 --> 13:32.640]  down up to 5,000 feet.
[13:32.640 --> 13:45.420]  I'm gonna say that again slowly. The West has given at least 10,000 heat seeking missiles
[13:45.420 --> 13:51.280]  with a range, an effective range of 5,000 feet. They actually have more than that, cuz
[13:51.280 --> 13:54.960]  I've seen the breakdown of the weapons they were given. They've also been given unguided
[13:54.960 --> 14:00.960]  rockets, point and shoot, that have an even longer range.
[14:00.960 --> 14:06.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, all they gotta do is go to a European airport, an Israeli airport,
[14:06.640 --> 14:15.640]  a US airport. You can sit back two, three miles from the airport. And where I sit is
[14:15.640 --> 14:19.960]  close to the Austin airport, and the planes sometimes come in at 3,000, 4,000 feet. You
[14:19.960 --> 14:24.720]  could sit, I guess I'm like four miles away.
[14:24.720 --> 14:31.960]  You could sit four miles away from the Austin-Bergstrom Airport. There it is, Seattle Times. Syrian
[14:31.960 --> 14:36.600]  rebels show off heat seeking missile. Yeah, that was back in November of last year. That's
[14:36.600 --> 14:45.320]  a year ago. I mean, this is the type of craziness that we deal with here, almost a year ago.
[14:45.320 --> 14:51.200]  And when I fly, they'll say, hello, Mr. Jones, we're taking you over here to grab your testicles,
[14:51.200 --> 14:57.240]  literally. They single me out for extra groping, extra harassment, and they call me Mr. Jones
[14:57.240 --> 14:58.640]  and laugh at me.
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.840]  And they laugh at Jesse Ventura when I fly with him, and grab his crotch and laugh, and
[15:02.840 --> 15:08.000]  then have the nerve to ask him for photos in Atlanta after they grabbed his testicles
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.360]  in front of me. And then Ventura wanted it erased off my phone, he was so embarrassed.
[15:12.360 --> 15:17.160]  He goes, I'm glad you documented it, but erase it off your phone. Always sat there at a Mexican
[15:17.160 --> 15:22.840]  food place eating. That's embarrassing. And that was when he made the decision, he goes,
[15:22.840 --> 15:25.280]  I'm not gonna fly anymore after this season.
[15:25.280 --> 15:30.840]  And I may get out of this country for good. He began to say, this is East Germany. I'm
[15:30.840 --> 15:35.360]  sick of this. You all know who I am. You're laughing at me. And these women were laughing,
[15:35.360 --> 15:40.080]  rubbing all over him. They had women doing it. I mean, incredible photos. I'm sitting
[15:40.080 --> 15:43.680]  there going, cuz they'd already searched me.
[15:43.680 --> 15:48.200]  I'm just sitting there with my iPhone, click, click, click, I had like 30 photos. It was
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.440]  just like out of South Park, literally, the exact characters out of South Park, the exact
[15:53.440 --> 15:59.480]  voice. South Park must have flown through Atlanta, cuz he was like, let me look inside
[15:59.480 --> 16:00.480]  you.
[16:00.480 --> 16:08.760]  I mean, this is what was going on. It was the exact people from the South Park episode.
[16:08.760 --> 16:16.600]  Obese black women. I guess here in Austin, it's obese white women. The point is, is that
[16:16.600 --> 16:20.880]  I sat there and I witnessed it. These would have been Drudge Report material photos.
[16:20.880 --> 16:26.000]  And he said, Alex, let me see you erase them. And I erase them if you wanna see, he goes,
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.400]  I trust you. By the way, Ventura's back in town. Remind me to call him today. I want
[16:32.400 --> 16:34.520]  the time to get him on before anybody else does.
[16:34.520 --> 16:40.080]  Nobody's been back for a few weeks. They go up there, go fishing with him. And I'm invited
[16:40.080 --> 16:43.280]  to go fishing. I think I'm gonna go fishing in Minnesota, except I don't wanna be groped
[16:43.280 --> 16:49.640]  on my way up there. All right, side issue, yes. You see those women, if you're watching
[16:49.640 --> 16:54.080]  us on TV, that is exactly what they look like.
[16:54.080 --> 16:57.000]  In fact, one of them looked just like her with the hair up, the other one looked like
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.360]  your light buddy. I mean, I don't know how they did it. I thought I was in a South Park
[17:00.360 --> 17:06.480]  episode when this was happening, cuz that had just come out. You gotta laugh at this
[17:06.480 --> 17:10.360]  stuff or you're gonna have to cry, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:10.360 --> 17:13.560]  And I mean, I'm telling you, they took their time with Ventura when he really got mad,
[17:13.560 --> 17:21.960]  cuz it is a violation when they went behind him with their hands. And then I thought they
[17:21.960 --> 17:25.260]  were supposed to have the same sex search you. Quite frankly, I like a different sex
[17:25.260 --> 17:29.820]  doing it. I mean, I'm not going after women when I get a massage, but I don't have men
[17:29.820 --> 17:30.820]  give me a massage.
[17:30.820 --> 17:34.360]  I've had it one time and I thought it was creepy. So I like women to give me a massage,
[17:34.360 --> 17:39.080]  it's not even sexual. It's just that, why is it okay that the same sex does it? Like
[17:39.080 --> 17:43.520]  if they wanna drag my son off to a private screening room or wanna grope him, it's like,
[17:43.520 --> 17:46.760]  don't worry, it's a pot-bellied guy with a mustache.
[17:46.760 --> 17:52.520]  I mean, I don't want my son being abused, having his innocence ruined by anybody. But
[17:52.520 --> 17:59.680]  if it's gonna have to happen, I mean, at least let it be a hot blonde. I mean, excuse me.
[17:59.680 --> 18:06.200]  Well, grandma, it's kinda creepy, man. Anyways, the point is, is that why is it okay that
[18:06.200 --> 18:10.800]  you have these women that obviously like women? It's been written about in the press. In fact,
[18:10.800 --> 18:14.680]  that Miss USA talked about her, was it Miss America, it was Miss USA in Dallas, how the
[18:14.680 --> 18:16.600]  woman was clearly enjoying it.
[18:16.600 --> 18:21.360]  There've been a bunch of good looking actresses talk about how it's women and how they clearly
[18:21.360 --> 18:27.080]  get excited. There was a case in the Panhandle, was it Amarillo? Yeah, they had to settle
[18:27.080 --> 18:35.480]  two years ago. They had a case in Amarillo where this woman was a knockout blonde. And
[18:35.480 --> 18:41.480]  the men got her aside, made her take her blouse off.
[18:41.480 --> 18:45.120]  And if you don't believe that, folks, they settled the case. And you've seen them take
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.120]  people's clothes off, all those videos online, little kids, old women, colostomy bags they
[18:49.120 --> 18:53.960]  rip off, I mean, you name it. Then they get mad at you when the, I mean, this is what
[18:53.960 --> 19:01.240]  goes on. And there she was in her bra crying and then the men swarmed her, was men doing
[19:01.240 --> 19:04.880]  it, and asked her for a date.
[19:04.880 --> 19:08.880]  And they sued, subpoenaed, got the surveillance footage, and they settled for a big chunk
[19:08.880 --> 19:13.480]  of change. TSA settles with Texas woman, try that article, you can put it up. There it
[19:13.480 --> 19:21.640]  is, lawsuit, airport search incidents, Amarillo, Globe News. Yeah, that's where she sued back
[19:21.640 --> 19:29.760]  in 2010. They settled the next year. TSA settles with Texas woman. And by the way, I tried
[19:29.760 --> 19:33.040]  to get her on, but they were in the lawsuit so they wouldn't come on.
[19:33.040 --> 19:36.720]  So I'm supposed to, how do I digress? When I come back, we're gonna get more into Syria
[19:36.720 --> 19:42.960]  coming up with Lee Rockwell, the bombshell. Obama says, hey, if you've got a business,
[19:42.960 --> 19:48.000]  you didn't build that. You didn't build the internet, the government did that. No, the
[19:48.000 --> 19:55.960]  human mind did that, not you. Now he says government is not tyranny, it is love. It
[19:55.960 --> 20:01.120]  cares about you in a sports stadium.
[20:01.120 --> 20:06.040]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. That bears repeating.

[22:37.800 --> 22:41.920]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[22:41.920 --> 22:45.280]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing

[24:20.840 --> 24:27.740]  Okay so yesterday Obama gave a speech to Ohio State University graduates. And this is exactly
[24:27.740 --> 24:33.960]  the speech he's given over and over again that that high ranking Secret Service agent
[24:33.960 --> 24:40.640]  Bongino had to quit over last year. Where he says the government is what creates prosperity.
[24:40.640 --> 24:48.760]  The government is what made America. Every philosopher, every historian from de Tocqueville
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.900]  right through to Oppenheimer, the inventor of the A bomb. We read some of his quotes
[24:53.900 --> 25:00.360]  yesterday on air, said it is the individual ingenuity unbound by government that created
[25:00.360 --> 25:02.080]  so much wealth.
[25:02.080 --> 25:05.520]  And you're like, well, America hadn't been that free. That's right, it hasn't. But compared
[25:05.520 --> 25:15.520]  to other countries in the area of free market, it has been light years ahead. Light years.
[25:15.520 --> 25:21.120]  And you look at Switzerland, smaller government, light years ahead of Europe. You look at any
[25:21.120 --> 25:27.080]  country where they get out of people's way. The only problem is there's been so much prosperity
[25:27.080 --> 25:33.360]  and so much wealth that the children of the children of the children that made the country
[25:33.360 --> 25:40.640]  great become decadent slobs and then organized crime sets in and takes over.
[25:40.640 --> 25:45.600]  And then you get a big powerful government and country that's run by crooks and then
[25:45.600 --> 25:53.240]  it's Nazi Germany time. You get a big powerful rich country that goes bad. The US has gone
[25:53.240 --> 25:59.080]  bad folks, we've been taken over. We're gonna make Nazi Germany look like pikers. It's already
[25:59.080 --> 26:00.600]  happened.
[26:00.600 --> 26:06.120]  But our propaganda is so good and nobody's beating us, the globalists that run us, the
[26:06.120 --> 26:10.720]  parasite globalists that have crawled inside our political brain and wrap themselves around
[26:10.720 --> 26:21.200]  our brain stem. They are so good at their propaganda that they are able to continue
[26:21.200 --> 26:25.120]  forward, though it's starting to grind to a halt a little bit.
[26:25.120 --> 26:29.720]  So they're doubling down. The world is in an epic crisis. It was George Washington that
[26:29.720 --> 26:35.200]  said government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous
[26:35.200 --> 26:42.360]  servant and a fearsome master. And I've got more of those quotes coming up. But here's
[26:42.360 --> 26:49.760]  Ronald Reagan, two clips from two different speeches Ronald Reagan gave, here it is.
[26:49.760 --> 26:56.600]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is
[26:56.600 --> 27:01.840]  the problem. From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become
[27:01.840 --> 27:09.120]  too complex to be managed by self-rule. That government by an elite group is superior to
[27:09.120 --> 27:14.780]  government for, by, and of the people.
[27:14.780 --> 27:20.400]  That was the central idea that won Reagan the presidency, a warning he had sounded consistently
[27:20.400 --> 27:26.520]  for years. You can hear it here in the speech that launched his political career.
[27:26.520 --> 27:31.240]  This is the issue of this election. Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government
[27:31.240 --> 27:36.240]  or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite
[27:36.240 --> 27:39.800]  in a far distant capital can plan our lives better than we can.
[27:39.800 --> 27:43.400]  And of course, he was quoting Thomas Jefferson there with a far distant elite. We're gonna
[27:43.400 --> 27:48.680]  cover that when we come back. But here's Obama yesterday at Ohio State University in a sports
[27:48.680 --> 27:51.120]  stadium packed full of young people.
[27:51.120 --> 27:54.400]  Because most of the new jobs will be in government or select corporations getting government
[27:54.400 --> 27:59.400]  money, corporate welfare. And here he was telling them, hey, government is the answer
[27:59.400 --> 28:05.160]  and don't let people bad mouth it. Well, the American way is to keep government small.
[28:05.160 --> 28:09.520]  Notice we didn't keep government small so the prosperity like oxygen disappearing out
[28:09.520 --> 28:17.080]  of a submarine is dissipating. Let's go and go to that clip of Obama yesterday.
[28:17.080 --> 28:23.140]  We the people chose to do these things together because we know this country cannot accomplish
[28:23.140 --> 28:30.840]  great things if we pursue nothing greater than our own individual ambition. Unfortunately,
[28:30.840 --> 28:37.200]  you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some
[28:37.200 --> 28:42.640]  separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[28:42.640 --> 28:47.840]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works. They'll warn that tyranny
[28:47.840 --> 28:55.080]  is always lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices because what
[28:55.080 --> 29:00.520]  they suggest is that our brave and creative and unique experiment in self-rule is somehow
[29:00.520 --> 29:07.000]  just a sham with which we can't be trusted.
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.400]  We have never been a people who place all of our faith in government to solve our problems.
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.680]  We shouldn't want to. But we don't think the government is the source of all our problems
[29:15.680 --> 29:19.520]  either. Because we understand that this democracy is ours.
[29:19.520 --> 29:24.440]  All right, that's enough. I'm going to come back and analyze this. But we're a constitutional
[29:24.440 --> 29:31.460]  republic, not a democracy. And the government is far and run now. And if we ever recognize
[29:31.460 --> 29:36.720]  that America has been hijacked, that will be the beginning of the end for these people.
[29:36.720 --> 29:41.940]  That's why they're responding to us, because they know that we're getting the message out.
[29:41.940 --> 29:49.840]  Stay with us. They are tyrants.
[29:49.840 --> 30:00.960]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.960 --> 30:05.680]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[30:05.680 --> 30:10.440]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When
[30:10.440 --> 30:15.880]  you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders? Check out SimpliSafe. It's

[31:00.480 --> 31:05.640]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[31:05.640 --> 31:10.800]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[31:10.800 --> 31:15.160]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[31:15.160 --> 31:19.680]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are.
[31:19.680 --> 31:24.640]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[31:24.640 --> 31:29.540]  Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability
[31:29.540 --> 31:34.000]  of your food supply with eFoods Direct. Be prepared before you need it. With nutrient-dense

[31:58.000 --> 32:02.980]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct. I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount
[32:02.980 --> 32:07.840]  of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body
[32:07.840 --> 32:12.600]  was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon
[32:12.600 --> 32:19.000]  as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.080]  Now there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out
[32:23.080 --> 32:31.640]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy
[32:31.640 --> 32:36.620]  Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other
[32:36.620 --> 32:42.440]  products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I
[32:42.440 --> 32:49.380]  want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products and
[32:49.380 --> 32:55.280]  you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[32:55.280 --> 33:02.800]  Your journey to health and wellness today. InfowarsTeam.com.
[33:02.800 --> 33:30.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:30.600 --> 33:34.840]  Alex Jones here back live. We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[33:34.840 --> 33:40.560]  It's 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern. And then we come back weeknight, 7 o'clock, Infowars Nightly
[33:40.560 --> 33:47.120]  News. If you're not a subscriber at InfowarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv, now is the time. Eleven
[33:47.120 --> 33:54.520]  memberships or $5.95 a month. That's less than 55 cents per person. You create one master
[33:54.520 --> 33:59.880]  username passcode. Share it with 30, 40 friends and family because it's very unlikely that
[33:59.880 --> 34:03.920]  eleven people will tune in simultaneously.
[34:03.920 --> 34:08.880]  Eleven people simultaneously can tune in to the nightly news show, get the video feed,
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.200]  the daytime show, see all my films, ebooks, dozens and dozens and dozens of other films.
[34:14.200 --> 34:19.020]  For the last few years, it's all been going up there in high def as well. The streams
[34:19.020 --> 34:23.140]  obviously aren't because most computers can't handle that. But the point is you then also
[34:23.140 --> 34:28.020]  pay for the bandwidth. Now again, create a username passcode that you can share, create
[34:28.020 --> 34:32.740]  an e-card and give it to 30, 40, 50 people in your family.
[34:32.740 --> 34:39.200]  If you try to log in then one night and you can't log in to Infowars Nightly News, mission
[34:39.200 --> 34:44.680]  completed. More than 11 people are now using the username passcode. Go and get another
[34:44.680 --> 34:51.360]  membership for $5.95 a month. The message is wake people up. If I had unlimited money
[34:51.360 --> 34:56.520]  and could just pay to have the bandwidth to have Infowars Nightly News and everything
[34:56.520 --> 34:58.320]  we do for free, I'd do it.
[34:58.320 --> 35:01.960]  But that's not a model that's sustainable. So we use the free market. We're hiring more
[35:01.960 --> 35:08.500]  reporters, more crew, adding more, more graphics people, more researchers. It's all happening
[35:08.500 --> 35:13.400]  right now. So become a part of the revolution against tyranny, part of the restoration of
[35:13.400 --> 35:21.560]  the republic. You have built Infowars.com. You have supported Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[35:21.560 --> 35:26.420]  You have supported this radio show and we support your liberties and freedoms as well.
[35:26.420 --> 35:33.040]  We are brethren. We are, to use the communist term, but in a liberty fashion, fellow travelers.
[35:33.040 --> 35:38.180]  We're on the same team. We're together in this fight. And I wanna thank all of you that

[35:51.880 --> 35:57.160]  and give it to friends and family. Buy the books, buy the videos. By the way, will somebody
[35:57.160 --> 36:00.520]  run me in the new magazine? It's right over here, but I can't reach it. Let me do a plug
[36:00.520 --> 36:03.520]  right now before I get back into Obama.
[36:03.520 --> 36:09.520]  This is the, I don't know, ninth issue of the magazine. It is the May issue. And if
[36:09.520 --> 36:13.680]  you're listening in Central Texas, you're in a very special place because there are
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.240]  60,000 of these on the streets of Austin, 20,000 on the streets of San Antonio, and
[36:18.240 --> 36:25.600]  another 10,000 or so smattered around in different areas of Central Texas.
[36:25.600 --> 36:30.880]  30,000 or so are held back to be able to be shipped out to you at cost. You can either
[36:30.880 --> 36:36.900]  buy them in 10 packs up to 100 at cost, or you can get a subscription. Gift subscriptions
[36:36.900 --> 36:43.000]  are the way to go because then somebody gets 12 of these in their mail. Great way to wake
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.320]  them up. Big, glossy magazine covering the history of stage terror, the attack on the
[36:48.320 --> 36:52.800]  Second Amendment, the whole police state, how to awaken America.
[36:52.800 --> 36:59.560]  It's all in the new issue, the history of false flags. And ladies and gentlemen, so
[36:59.560 --> 37:06.720]  much more, like three high quality, not paper, but plastic. The big, heavy, petroleum-based
[37:06.720 --> 37:11.800]  that lasts for years. Infowars.com, Save the Constitution bumper sticker, prisonplanet.com
[37:11.800 --> 37:15.080]  bumper sticker, and infowars.com bumper sticker.
[37:15.080 --> 37:22.280]  What a weapon. We're talking, I did the math, 200,000 bumper stickers in Central Texas right
[37:22.280 --> 37:27.440]  now waiting on the free newsstands for you to get them and post them in legal and lawful
[37:27.440 --> 37:33.240]  areas. This should be explosive. I want everybody to go out, get them, post them, and this is
[37:33.240 --> 37:37.720]  a test to bomb other cities with info weapons.
[37:37.720 --> 37:42.860]  Legal and lawful areas, your property, your car, or in commons where people, some bars
[37:42.860 --> 37:48.640]  or areas let you put up stickers, or restaurants. The point is, that's like the wallpaper. This
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.120]  is gonna be explosive. Infowars Magazine, get it today. And by the way, this will sell
[37:53.120 --> 37:56.080]  out unlike any other publication.
[37:56.080 --> 38:01.160]  Of nine publications, we've had six of them sell out. This one is set to sell out, it
[38:01.160 --> 38:06.120]  looks like in four or five days, if it continues. I'm tempted to have more printed, by the way,
[38:06.120 --> 38:11.680]  they're selling so quickly, they have more bumper stickers put on them. Anyways, infowarsstore.com
[38:11.680 --> 38:15.920]  is where you can find the subscription to the magazine and everything else. Pro pure
[38:15.920 --> 38:19.240]  water filters, 10% off with promo code water.
[38:19.240 --> 38:25.520]  Now, there's a bunch of military news, economic news, Lou Rockwell's coming up, Ron Paul in
[38:25.520 --> 38:32.120]  Chile. Chile is the southernmost part of South America. I don't know why I said Europe. I
[38:32.120 --> 38:35.900]  was reading he's also gonna be going to Europe soon, so that's why I said that. He's in South
[38:35.900 --> 38:41.880]  America right now. No one caught that out there, but I caught myself.
[38:41.880 --> 38:45.640]  Again, we make mistakes. When we do, I point them out. It's usually I flip things around
[38:45.640 --> 38:49.920]  cuz my brain's moving so quick. I know that happens to you as well. But we've got just
[38:49.920 --> 38:55.920]  a ton of important info we're gonna be covering here today. It's just overwhelming. But I
[38:55.920 --> 38:58.660]  wanted to read to you some quotes here.
[38:58.660 --> 39:04.020]  This is from Thomas Jefferson. A private central bank issuing the public currency is a greater
[39:04.020 --> 39:09.360]  menace to liberties of the people than a standing army. We must not let our rulers load us with
[39:09.360 --> 39:17.120]  perpetual debt. So that's one quote, and I've got some more of the founding father quotes
[39:17.120 --> 39:18.120]  I wanna get to.
[39:18.120 --> 39:24.220]  But it's very important to go to Paul Watson's article on infowars.com because it not only
[39:24.220 --> 39:31.180]  has Obama at the speech to a packed group of young impressionable minds with the image
[39:31.180 --> 39:40.000]  of a giant jumbotron up above the stadium right out of 1984. But it has the Ronald Reagan
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.560]  speech to counter it, and I'm gonna have Paul Watson add some founding father quotes to
[39:44.560 --> 39:45.560]  that as well.
[39:45.560 --> 39:53.420]  But one more time, let's play this Obama speech from yesterday afternoon where he doubles
[39:53.420 --> 40:01.580]  down on you didn't build that. The state is the answer. I mean, that is North Korea talking.
[40:01.580 --> 40:08.300]  That is Nazi Germany talking. We know historically, this is so diametrically opposed to what this
[40:08.300 --> 40:09.800]  country has been based on.
[40:09.800 --> 40:16.020]  You cannot debate that. And the fact that they're involved in this radical transformation,
[40:16.020 --> 40:19.220]  they're telling the military, you can't talk about Jesus. You can talk about anything else
[40:19.220 --> 40:24.460]  you want. Don't talk about Jesus. You have a right to talk about your faith. They're
[40:24.460 --> 40:28.660]  telling school kids all over America, you can't thank God at your commencement.
[40:28.660 --> 40:34.220]  Your commencement is your private statement. You could say I love soccer. I love baseball.
[40:34.220 --> 40:44.140]  I love Marilyn Monroe. I love slits malt liquor. I love Gatorade. I love Parcheesi. I love
[40:44.140 --> 40:52.580]  Tiddlywinks. I love gardening. Or I owe this all to my dad or my single mom that made me
[40:52.580 --> 40:56.420]  work hard, that I'm valedictorian.
[40:56.420 --> 41:07.220]  First Amendment, the First Amendment clearly states that Congress shall make no law respecting
[41:07.220 --> 41:12.740]  an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. That means government
[41:12.740 --> 41:18.620]  can't be involved. The First Amendment says the government can't at a public school say
[41:18.620 --> 41:23.820]  we're now gonna worship Muhammad or the Prophet Muhammad.
[41:23.820 --> 41:30.940]  We're gonna worship Allah. We're gonna worship the Virgin Mary. We're gonna worship a rock.
[41:30.940 --> 41:35.860]  We're gonna worship a whale. We're gonna worship whatever it is you worship. We're gonna worship
[41:35.860 --> 41:43.140]  dogs like the Zoho Astors do. The state can't do that. That's what Thomas Jefferson was
[41:43.140 --> 41:44.140]  talking about.
[41:44.140 --> 41:47.380]  And Christians don't even debate this, most of them not here on radio, from the right
[41:47.380 --> 41:53.060]  perspective. They're like, I hate Thomas Jefferson. He was anti-Christian. No, he wasn't. He said
[41:53.060 --> 41:58.340]  you have a right to practice whatever religion you want and to talk about it. The state cannot
[41:58.340 --> 42:02.200]  have an official religion.
[42:02.200 --> 42:07.400]  And so now they say, troops can't talk about Jesus. You can't go at your commencement speech
[42:07.400 --> 42:14.820]  and talk about what you want. And that gets to the point where you can't say USA, USA,
[42:14.820 --> 42:19.700]  USA when a San Antonio basketball team is winning.
[42:19.700 --> 42:25.020]  By the way, they did the math was half Hispanic, but the other team was more than half Hispanic
[42:25.020 --> 42:28.980]  and thought because I guess they identify themselves as Mexicans, not Americans, that
[42:28.980 --> 42:35.300]  was against them. When all it is, is the chant everyone does when they're feeling good now.
[42:35.300 --> 42:37.060]  I think it's quite mindless.
[42:37.060 --> 42:38.060]  USA, USA.
[42:38.060 --> 42:43.780]  I mean, I would chant USA, USA, let's play some more of it. If we abolish the Federal
[42:43.780 --> 42:49.060]  Reserve, if we arrested David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger for crimes against humanity.
[42:49.060 --> 42:53.060]  If we restored the Republic, if we got rid of the IRS and the income tax that goes the
[42:53.060 --> 42:59.220]  private Federal Reserve. If we educated people that vaccine science is real and may have
[42:59.220 --> 43:03.020]  some benefits for artificial immunity.
[43:03.020 --> 43:07.540]  But that the globalists have been caught adding stuff to it and are involved in a eugenics
[43:07.540 --> 43:15.860]  program to cull the herd and lower IQs. If we stopped using the Monsanto BT corn and
[43:15.860 --> 43:19.860]  stuff that kills the bugs that eat it, but then we're supposed to be able to safely eat
[43:19.860 --> 43:24.140]  it when it grows its own pesticide as a pharmacological crop.
[43:24.140 --> 43:30.420]  If that ever came out instead of us going from 1 in 25,000 with autism to 1 in 51 now,
[43:30.420 --> 43:35.100]  and people being brain damaged and illnesses everywhere from BT corn and there's a big
[43:35.100 --> 43:41.700]  study out on it today. And if we started reversing the trend and it was 1 in 10,000 getting autism,
[43:41.700 --> 43:49.980]  I would say USA, USA, USA. When we win for the Second Amendment, when we reverse tyranny
[43:49.980 --> 43:55.060]  and restore what makes USA, USA, USA something worth chanting.
[43:55.060 --> 44:01.960]  But you don't chant USA, USA when the police lock down 80% of the city and come into houses
[44:01.960 --> 44:06.860]  and grab women who don't even look like the reported puppet, Patsy and throw them down
[44:06.860 --> 44:18.460]  the stairs. That's when I chant USA, USA, USA, but I'm now digressing. Imagine Obama
[44:18.460 --> 44:22.740]  coming out and saying, if you got a business, you didn't build that, and then he wants a
[44:22.740 --> 44:26.060]  civilian force just as big and just as big as our own military.
[44:26.060 --> 44:31.760]  A domestic drafted force of youth, which they've now been graduating and are now involved in
[44:31.760 --> 44:39.100]  warrant service, surveillance, citizen spies under Infra Guard. And if we have a debate
[44:39.100 --> 44:42.540]  about it, they go, Alex Jones is crazy. He thinks there's thousands of armored vehicles,
[44:42.540 --> 44:47.940]  billions of bullets and citizen spies. When you can go read officially that's been set
[44:47.940 --> 44:54.920]  up. Because again, they're using another military tactic on us, knowing we're atomized, knowing
[44:54.920 --> 44:56.760]  we're all individuals.
[44:56.760 --> 45:01.140]  And so even if we know it's true, what organization do we fight through? That's why they hate
[45:01.140 --> 45:05.820]  Infowars.com, because we're able to organize people. We're able to show you you're not
[45:05.820 --> 45:11.780]  alone. We're able to force this out and call them on their lies. It shows two things, not
[45:11.780 --> 45:13.660]  enough people are involved as leaders.
[45:13.660 --> 45:19.620]  And it also shows how pathetically weak the globalist are, that my ham-fisted broadcast,
[45:19.620 --> 45:23.460]  toe to toe with the New World Order, with a little help from our friends in the real
[45:23.460 --> 45:29.260]  media, are able to devastate the globalist, lower their approval ratings, and force major
[45:29.260 --> 45:31.900]  stories out in the open.
[45:31.900 --> 45:36.460]  And who are the little help from our friends? Number one, you the listeners, the sponsors
[45:36.460 --> 45:47.000]  of this broadcast, number two, giants in media like DrudgeReport.com in true media. And George
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.820]  Norie helping us out and CoastToCoastAM.com and so many others who love their children.
[45:52.820 --> 45:58.360]  Let me tell you, you know we're on an express elevator to hell. You know we're on a roller
[45:58.360 --> 46:03.560]  coaster going into a bad place. And if you don't get involved and realize that dangerous
[46:03.560 --> 46:08.780]  mega cartels have walked into America, bought off our government, run their own candidates
[46:08.780 --> 46:13.140]  for office, and are now trying to demonize states' rights and demonize patriots because
[46:13.140 --> 46:15.420]  we're the only opposition to them.
[46:15.420 --> 46:19.220]  But the truth is we have the moral authority. We have history on our side. We have the Bill
[46:19.220 --> 46:23.260]  of Rights, the Constitution, the law. I mean, they're now on CNN with FBI agents going,
[46:23.260 --> 46:27.640]  yeah, we're listening to everything you do. It's for your safety. That's a felony every
[46:27.640 --> 46:28.740]  time they do that.
[46:28.740 --> 46:33.220]  They are flaunting torture in your face, hoping they can normalize it. They are flaunting
[46:33.220 --> 46:38.320]  secret arrests in your face. They are flaunting martial law. They are flaunting military drills.
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.020]  They are flaunting the end of the Fourth and Fifth Amendment. They are flaunting warrantless
[46:42.020 --> 46:47.420]  checkpoints to try to get you to just roll over.
[46:47.420 --> 46:52.980]  You can do two things in a fight. If you're cornered, roll over, get in a fetal position,
[46:52.980 --> 46:57.440]  and kiss your butt goodbye. And most cowards take that route, or you can charge up and
[46:57.440 --> 47:02.940]  turn it loose. And let me tell you something, even if somebody is bigger and badder and
[47:02.940 --> 47:08.180]  meaner than you, when they're attacking you, they're not in the right.
[47:08.180 --> 47:13.320]  And they don't have the energy. And even if they're three times stronger than you and
[47:13.320 --> 47:20.460]  better trained than you, if you kick and bite and snap and poke and punch and just turn
[47:20.460 --> 47:25.500]  loose your human power, you will stomp their butt nine times out of ten. And even if they're
[47:25.500 --> 47:28.440]  the baddest guy in the world, I'm using the fight analogy.
[47:28.440 --> 47:33.020]  They're not gonna wanna mess with you a second time cuz they're gonna get hurt bad. And it's
[47:33.020 --> 47:37.740]  the same thing with government. You roll over, you worship black uniforms, you worship tyranny.
[47:37.740 --> 47:42.380]  You go see movies, propaganda movies like Iron Man 3, where there's terrorists blowing
[47:42.380 --> 47:54.700]  everything up in a false flag to cover up genetically engineered soldiers that are exploding.
[47:54.700 --> 47:59.940]  You go see that in Olympus Has Fallen and this movie. All these movies about bombs going
[47:59.940 --> 48:06.060]  off in US cities right before and right as it happens, it's all programmed. I've talked
[48:06.060 --> 48:11.260]  to the people in Hollywood, not just Hagman of the X-Files, who as a CIA approached them
[48:11.260 --> 48:15.060]  with the plot of flying a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center to blame it on Al-Qaeda,
[48:15.060 --> 48:19.140]  who they run, and using a drill to make them stand down.
[48:19.140 --> 48:26.620]  Do you understand that? I mean, I see the PR rollout. They got a bunch of movies coming
[48:26.620 --> 48:32.200]  out about bombs going off all over America. Get ready, criminals love to brag and tell
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.340]  you what they're doing. And then you go fantasize that America still exists and that America's
[48:36.340 --> 48:37.920]  fighting Al-Qaeda.
[48:37.920 --> 48:46.260]  And you got some guy out of the Middle East, the last Iron Man. He's fighting a guy from
[48:46.260 --> 48:50.580]  Russia and the one before that he's fighting terrorists in Afghanistan and that's where
[48:50.580 --> 48:58.020]  he gets the Iron Man suit. It's all the same when in truth the globalist run Al-Qaeda.
[48:58.020 --> 49:05.860]  The globalist are the equivalent of Spectre or Chaos or Cobra. They tell you on all the
[49:05.860 --> 49:07.620]  shows they're laughing at you.
[49:07.620 --> 49:12.700]  They teach you the bad guys are this phantom group that nobody can stop that wear a mask
[49:12.700 --> 49:17.540]  because the government is the terrorist. Because the government is a foreign banking combine
[49:17.540 --> 49:22.060]  that's attacking every country, that wants every country enslaved, that wants every country
[49:22.060 --> 49:26.900]  authoritarian because then they can come in and dominate and have top down integrated
[49:26.900 --> 49:32.300]  systems of authoritarian command and control economy so they can play God with your life.
[49:32.300 --> 49:38.420]  When we come back, I'm gonna play the clip again and get to these quotes of Obama. You
[49:38.420 --> 49:45.500]  guys punched my computer up, I wanna show people this image. This is up on infowars.com
[49:45.500 --> 49:55.060]  right now. The image is up there on the site of Obama on a jumbotron at the Ohio stadium
[49:55.060 --> 50:06.140]  like something out of 1984 with tens of thousands of people there hearing that the government
[50:06.140 --> 50:12.540]  is what makes the grass grow. That the government is what organizes society. This is pure command
[50:12.540 --> 50:17.900]  and control collectivism from a guy run by Warren Buffett, whose wealth just increased
[50:17.900 --> 50:21.600]  49% in one year.
[50:21.600 --> 50:25.780]  And who has just, in fact, I'm gonna dig the article back out. You guys put that Warren
[50:25.780 --> 50:31.860]  Buffett article back up there? That has just a giant amount of cash. And if you look it
[50:31.860 --> 50:43.060]  up, he got roughly $45 billion in 2008 of banker bailout money. Gee, why do you think
[50:43.060 --> 50:50.580]  Obama called for it as a senator? And in cash, ladies and gentlemen, in cash, the man is
[50:50.580 --> 50:56.940]  rolling in some of the biggest cash reserves in the world, directly your tax money. Now
[50:56.940 --> 51:00.660]  you know why Warren Buffett wants higher taxes.
[51:00.660 --> 51:05.180]  Are you one of the millions of Americans worried about change? Do you lose sleep over what
[51:05.180 --> 51:08.720]  could happen to your assets and hard-earned money? Are you looking for a better way of
[51:08.720 --> 51:13.260]  life with more freedom, security and asset protection? If you answered yes to any of

[52:58.820 --> 53:05.060]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[53:05.060 --> 53:10.260]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[53:10.260 --> 53:14.540]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[53:14.540 --> 53:19.000]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are.

[54:31.500 --> 54:41.420]  feel how ancient the universe is? Do you feel like you've always been here? We're all part
[54:41.420 --> 55:02.420]  of it. Listen to Johnny Cash. He's up there riding. Alright, ladies and gentlemen. Let
[55:02.420 --> 55:06.260]  me go over some of these headlines. By the way, I have a correction to make. I was going
[55:06.260 --> 55:13.780]  off mental notes and I just said Warren Buffett had a 49% increase in profits from taxpayer
[55:13.780 --> 55:14.940]  money mainly.
[55:14.940 --> 55:24.600]  By the way, that's in the AP and Reuters articles, a minor footnote. I'm sorry. I conflated and
[55:24.600 --> 55:31.820]  flipped the two numbers. Will you guys punch this up here? Actually, my Bloomberg article,
[55:31.820 --> 55:42.420]  punch it up here on my screen. Berkshire Cash hits record $49.1 billion as profit climbs.
[55:42.420 --> 55:50.180]  So they've got an extra cash there. And then it's Berkshire profit rises 51%, shares at
[55:50.180 --> 55:51.700]  record high.
[55:51.700 --> 55:56.060]  And Reuters says Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on Friday and quarterly profit
[55:56.060 --> 56:01.780]  rose only 51% on a solid performance in insurance. So they make you buy Obamacare now. It's going
[56:01.780 --> 56:05.700]  to go up. He was the chief lobbyist for that. And by many of its other businesses as well
[56:05.700 --> 56:12.980]  as gains from investments and derivatives. Guys, will you guys pull up Warren Buffett
[56:12.980 --> 56:15.940]  got bailout money?
[56:15.940 --> 56:25.140]  And let's see if my memory is correct. He got 44.5 billion. 44.5 billion. This is not
[56:25.140 --> 56:29.460]  a parlor trick. We're going off my memory here. Warren Buffett, just type in Warren
[56:29.460 --> 56:36.820]  for TV viewers, you'll see it. Warren Buffett got bailout money. And it was 44.5 bill. Now
[56:36.820 --> 56:43.940]  that was round one. That was five years ago. Oh, don't worry. It's been lavish. I'm sorry.
[56:43.940 --> 56:53.900]  All they could find was a newer one. I'm sorry. It's 150 billion. But wait, on that he got
[56:53.900 --> 57:02.540]  44.5. Read the fine print. 44.5 bill. 44.5 bill. And he's up there going, my secretary
[57:02.540 --> 57:05.620]  pays more tax than me.
[57:05.620 --> 57:11.000]  I wanna raise your taxes, you schmucks. You sucker scum. By the way, I'm on a eugenics
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.980]  board that's been leaked on how we're gonna jack you up with vaccines. I want you to eat
[57:14.980 --> 57:23.260]  that GMO corn, okay? Cuz I'm such a good man. Warren Buffett, champion of bailout, also
[57:23.260 --> 57:30.420]  leading beneficiary, McClatchy. Can you say dirt bag scum? You wanna know why they're
[57:30.420 --> 57:31.920]  setting up police state?
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.860]  You wanna know cuz they can't believe they've gotten away with these crimes. Warren Buffett,
[57:37.860 --> 57:45.980]  let's not exaggerate, is about 500 times worse than Bernie Madoff. Bernie Madoff stole
[57:45.980 --> 57:51.680]  around 100 billion in Ponzi schemes. But Warren Buffett is connected as a Rothschild Rockefeller
[57:51.680 --> 57:59.460]  agent on record to a large portion, some estimates are a third, of the global two quadrillion.
[57:59.460 --> 58:02.720]  It was 1.5 quadrillion. I've been using that number for four years. I looked it up. It's
[58:02.720 --> 58:11.520]  estimated cuz they've increased derivatives over two quadrillion. Yeah, and you know what?
[58:11.520 --> 58:17.860]  The men in black uniforms are gonna make sure you sign on to Too Big To Fail cuz it's designed
[58:17.860 --> 58:21.740]  to fail. And make sure you go down with a ship while Warren Buffett's flying around
[58:21.740 --> 58:27.140]  his jet. And that's what the whole grid, and the spying, and the torture's about, is to
[58:27.140 --> 58:32.940]  make sure you do what you're told. And the cops are all gonna salute as their pension
[58:32.940 --> 58:37.600]  funds and guns are taken as well. Yes sir, Warren Buffett, we bow to you cuz you got
[58:37.600 --> 58:40.020]  a red carpet.

[59:53.500 --> 01:00:05.300]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:12.300]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:27.780]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:31.780]  I can't wait to get Lou Rockwell on in the next segment. We've got an FBI agent saying
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:38.180]  what we already knew, that the government listens to every phone call on CNN, just flaunting
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:44.260]  it in our face. Obama has doubled down on his you didn't build that quotes. He has come
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:50.100]  out and said that government is basically what generates most of the good things in
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:54.500]  society to another group of college students who most of which will not be able to get
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:59.560]  jobs unless it is with the government. And they've already actuated out how under this
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.660]  new system we're all gonna be poor except for them.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:07.900]  Warren Buffett, that is the main beneficiary, one of the main beneficiaries of banker bailout
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:14.300]  money. And again, Buffett also doesn't just want your money, he wants to bankrupt you
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.500]  and says you're living too high on the hog and having too many children. But you know
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:23.540]  if you type in Warren Buffett's name, he's always almost seen with an ice cream cone
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.940]  to be non-threatening.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:30.980]  I'm convinced if Hitler would have worn a pink uniform and held ice cream cones, as
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:35.460]  you type in Warren Buffett ice cream cone, there's literally hundreds of photos, ice
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:41.540]  cream that we'd be under Hitlerian rule right now. If he said hope and change for the children,
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.980]  I'm a loving liberal. And if they would have given him a Nobel Peace Prize, it would have
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:45.980]  been over.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:50.760]  When he was attacking France, Russia, you name it. In fact, I nominate Adolf Hitler
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:56.420]  for the peace prize. Because I don't like Hitler, but to be clear, look, he's got an
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:02.500]  ice cream cone. He's not threatening. Sure, he gave 40 plus billion of taxpayer money
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:08.140]  he stole to eugenics operations cuz he loves you.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:17.620]  Look at a nice old man. Nice old man, he's a nice old man. He's gonna take good care
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:23.380]  of you and your family up there in Lincoln, Nebraska. We all know what goes on up in Lincoln,
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:30.100]  Nebraska. Warren Buffett wants to take care of you and your family as he gets your taxpayer
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:34.740]  money, 150 billion of it, in one serving alone.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:40.620]  We're gonna go to Lou Rockwell and talk about that. And no wonder I'm an extremist against
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:45.020]  the bailouts. They say now, first they admitted that it was your tax money to bail out foreign
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:49.220]  tax. Notice now when you're in the news, yeah, we're bankrupt cuz you're lazy, America. You're
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:51.860]  not working enough and it's the people on welfare that did it.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:55.340]  And I'm not for the welfare because it makes them dependent and it makes them a voting
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:03:00.940]  block for government. But these people are getting chicken feed compared to the two quadrillion.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:06.620]  Look Obama, there's hundreds of photos of him with an ice cream, he's not threatening.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:11.620]  See, they know that hits areas of your mind associated with childhood stuff.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:17.800]  It's like, look, Obama's not threatening ice cream cone. Sure, he is arresting whistleblowers
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.620]  all over the country to report government crime at unprecedented levels. Sure, he's
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:24.380]  using Al-Qaeda to attack Syria and other countries.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:33.340]  Look, there's Bill Gates with Warren Buffett in an ice cream cone. See, I mean, it's not
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:41.420]  threatening, it's ice cream, folks. And they talk to you like your children. When you go
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:44.620]  see movies like Iron Man and stuff, it's designed for children.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:49.660]  Every show, America's good and America's fighting terrorists. And then you look at the real
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:54.260]  world, the people that run America run those terrorists in every case. Even the cases where
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:04:00.160]  it's a real crazy that attacks, you find out they have some MI6 or CIA or Mossad or French
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.580]  intelligence or German intelligence handler.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:09.540]  And then when there's major bombings in Russia, it kept turning out that it was Putin people.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:15.060]  They even caught, Moscow police caught Putin, FSB planting bombs in a fourth building in
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:19.700]  99. And they said, you have to release us, it's real bombs, but it was part of a drill.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:23.620]  See, now you know why they have drills. And I'm supposed to just sit here and be naive
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:27.420]  and go see Iron Man and sit there and just walk out and cry for America.
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:33.980]  It's like guys that go see Rocky. And then walk out of the Rocky movie and start a fight
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:40.380]  in the parking lot. Get their butt kicked. I mean, it is imaginary. Notice they had Pearl
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:47.540]  Harbor come out right before 9-11. And Rand Corporation said there's about to be a terror
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:52.020]  attack on the order of Pearl Harbor. When there is, we will radically transform America.
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:57.220]  I mean, they think you're stupid folks. They brag openly about all this. They think you're
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:01.220]  dumb. Are you dumb?
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:06.820]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:11.420]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support

[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:29.140]  We are here, ladies and gentlemen, live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:35.460]  Standard Time. We come back weeknights, 7 o'clock Central, Infowars Nightly News. Find
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:43.180]  out more at infowarsnews.com or infowars.com forward slash show. And of course, also have
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:48.420]  the Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m. We're hiring more reporters, more crew, more journalists, more
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:53.420]  researchers. We are trying to pour every dime of support that comes into this operation
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.460]  in defense of our constitutional republic.
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:02.180]  We take it personal that these nasty authoritarians tell us we didn't paint our own oil painting.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:06.980]  We didn't create a new engine. You didn't create a new song. You didn't learn how to
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.840]  play the guitar. Your mother and father didn't raise you. You didn't pay enough taxes on
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:19.020]  average more than 55% of everything you earn. No. If you've got a business, you didn't build
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:22.980]  that. Somebody else made that happen. Well, now Obama, and this is up at infowars.com,
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:30.340]  we're gonna play the audio and video right now, has come out and said that government
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:34.260]  is not a tyranny and we shouldn't listen to the voices that say that.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:38.400]  Like George Washington, like Thomas Jefferson, last hour I read a lot of their quotes about
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:48.940]  George Washington, government is like fire, a dangerous servant and a fearsome master.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:54.020]  Thomas Jefferson, same quotes, on and on and on. Our country was founded against this.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.180]  Ronald Reagan, who didn't live up to what he said he'd do in many cases, but at least
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:01.340]  had rhetoric saying the most scary words in the English language. I'm from the government
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:06.140]  and I'm here to help you. I have run into in government more arrogant criminal people
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.160]  in my life than anybody else.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:14.740]  And government's growing, growing, growing, growing. It now spends, what is it, 60% of
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:20.820]  the GDP one way or another is going into government. And it's gonna be more and more into the future.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:25.940]  They've signed us on to two quadrillion now in derivatives. And look at the articles I
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:32.220]  showed last hour, they're going to Lou Rockwell. Berkshire cash, its record 49.1 billion, that's
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:36.380]  just their cash as profit climbs. And what does Reuters report their main profit was
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:41.500]  from? Derivatives and insurance, making you buy insurance, the price doubling roughly
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:44.660]  in the last year, that's on record.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:49.320]  Congressional Budget Office, the main lobbyist for the government run healthcare, making
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:53.460]  you buy overpriced insurance. Then government tells doctors what care they can give to make
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:57.540]  sure your bill isn't too high.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:05.700]  And who got $150 billion, $44 billion to himself in the first round of bailout? Reuters, please,
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:10.740]  McClatchy, please put it on screen. Warren Buffett, who lobbies for higher taxes on you?
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:15.980]  I'm gonna explain this to all the stupid socialists out there. It's right out of Atlas Shrugged.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:22.500]  The big rich guys shut down one guy's railroad, so their railroad gets all the traffic.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:30.860]  Same story, Keystone Pipeline, there it is. Warren Buffett on AIG, McClatchy, 150 billion
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:37.580]  bailout. That was 2008, I did the math. Do you know how much his group of companies has
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:41.700]  gotten in different Federal Reserve type bailouts?
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:49.020]  It's over $300 billion that you gotta back up and pay for. There's McClatchy right there
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:56.420]  on screen. 300 billion smackers. You wanna know why they want a tyranny in place? Cuz
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:01.300]  they know you may take America back and they're all gonna go to jail. But you gotta identify
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.620]  the tyranny first, and that's what Obama's scared of.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:09.260]  He doesn't want you to get back to the original idea of big government is a tyranny. Out of
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:14.420]  control government is the ultimate threat. Big government is the plague. Infestation
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:20.900]  of government is the plague. Corruption within government, as Cicero said, 2,050 something
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:25.900]  years ago in Rome, their main historian, the rock star of his age.
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:37.260]  Now I wanna play this clip and go to Lou Rockwell because this is like, I mean, I know like
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:45.180]  nails on a chalkboard. I know this is like nails on a chalkboard for Lou Rockwell out
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:52.040]  there. This is Obama at Ohio State yesterday, doubling down on his you didn't build it statement
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:57.380]  and saying we don't need people saying, these people that say government can become a tyranny.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.700]  And always worrying about a tyranny that's about to come around the corner. No, no, it's
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.460]  already here.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.820]  Tyranny's already here. They're on CNN saying we listened to all your phone calls and it's
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.000]  for your own safety. We have that clip coming up. They've gone from denying it to admitting
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.460]  it and saying it's bad to now saying you're lucky we care enough to listen to everything
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.900]  you do.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:21.620]  You're lucky we put the CIA bomber on the CIA payroll, Tamerlan. That's confirmed. You're
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:25.940]  lucky we had martial law in Boston. We're gonna talk about it all with Lou Rockwell
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:30.620]  play a clip of Ron Paul's speech in Chile and more. But the good news is this show's
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:36.180]  getting more popular. Lourockwell.com is getting more popular. Ron Paul's a rock star worldwide.
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:43.120]  I'm very popular worldwide. The anti New World Order libertarian party, UKIP only a decade
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:50.780]  or so old has exploded and has won the major elections over in England.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:54.980]  But the enemy's gonna counter strike back. They're now saying we're basically terrorists
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.600]  in the news. Anybody that wants liberty, well, that's the new terror threat. Think of that.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.040]  That convicts them right there. That shows they're wild authoritarians. But here's the
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:12.620]  Obama clip and we'll get Lou Rockwell's take on it. This is from Ohio State yesterday.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:18.700]  We the people chose to do these things together because we know this country cannot accomplish
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:26.420]  great things if we pursue nothing greater than our own individual ambition. Unfortunately,
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:32.780]  you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:39.260]  separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems. Some of these same voices
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:44.660]  also do their best to gum up the works. They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:52.140]  the corner. You should reject these voices because what they suggest is that our brave
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:58.740]  and creative and unique experiment in self-rule is somehow just a sham with which we can't
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:02.580]  be trusted.
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.980]  We have never been a people who place all of our faith in government to solve our problems.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:11.220]  We shouldn't want to. But we don't think the government is the source of all our problems
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.220]  here.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.180]  All right, that's enough. Shut him up. Lou Rockwell, founder of the Von Mies Institute,
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:20.920]  Ron Paul's former chief of staff, one of the leading intellectuals for liberty out there
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.580]  worldwide. What he's doing there, I want to get your take on this, is clearly recasting
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:31.380]  it that if we vote for a big government, that that's America empowering government, and
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.220]  that America is government.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:37.900]  And he's telling the young people you're part of that larger collective. I mean, this is
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:43.060]  direct Mao Zedong paraphrasing quotes for those that don't know. I knew I recognized
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:48.100]  it yesterday and it just clicked. Those are Mao, basically Mao quotes. Seven of his czars
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:53.180]  have quoted Mao. Lou Rockwell, what does it say about where we are, that they are now
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.900]  this brazen, sir?
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:16:00.500]  Well, I actually think, Alex, this is good news. I mean, they're actually worried about
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:05.280]  people like us. So if there's one thing, if you want to get young people, I'm talking
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:10.700]  about smart, intellectually curious young people, not the younger equivalent of the
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.140]  sheeple, but smart young people.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:17.620]  If you want to get them interested in something, tell them, don't read that. Don't listen to
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:21.780]  that. Pay no attention to that. So what is the, of course, the first thing they do is
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:26.260]  they want to find out what am I being told not to look at? So Obama is talking about
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.940]  libertarians, anarcho capitalists, people who correctly point out that the government
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:37.660]  is mankind's greatest enemy on earth, that it is the predator, that it brings about all
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:42.320]  these wars, that it takes all our money, that it spies on us, that it puts us in prison
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:48.780]  camps and the US, of course, the world capital of putting innocent people in prison far more
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.180]  than any other country on earth.
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:55.140]  We can just go right down the list. Of course, the US is a tyranny. The government is a tyranny.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.400]  Still the American people, or certainly enough of the American people, are still devoted
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:03.860]  to liberty, don't want to be run by the government, don't want to have their phone calls spied
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:08.700]  on by the CIA and their emails and their texts and every other communication.
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:13.660]  So I think there's more and more opposition, even though this is a very difficult era to
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:18.660]  be living in for people who believe in liberty. But I think that liberty is so creative, the
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:24.860]  government is so stupid, that I'm very optimistic about the future, especially among the young
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:29.180]  people. And I'll bet you anything, there are a lot of those kids at Ohio State who listen
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:35.860]  to Obama, who today are looking up people like us. So I think he made a mistake. But
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.140]  again, it shows, of course, his heart, it shows where he is.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:44.780]  It shows the danger of, frankly, mass democracy, which has led to some of the biggest, worst
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:50.500]  governments ever. Hitler, of course, was elected, and many, many bad governments. Why we've
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.700]  had Hans-Hermann Hoppe writes about this in his great book Democracy, The God That Failed,
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:59.380]  about why the worst wars ever have come about under democracy.
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:00.380]  And the public is so ignorant.
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:02.780]  Why the biggest governments ever come about under democracy.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:08.020]  Sure, some new listeners are ignorant to the fact that when we badmouth democracy, they
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:11.900]  think we want authoritarianism. Will you briefly explain the difference between a republic
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.820]  and a democracy, sir?
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:18.980]  Well, a democracy is an unlimited government where people believe that if you can get the
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:22.900]  majority to vote one way, and of course, it's never the majority. All these elections are
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:29.360]  decided by minorities and sometimes small minorities. But if people in an election decide
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.580]  for anything, it's legitimate. Well, of course, that's not true. If people can decide to take
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:38.860]  somebody else's property through a democratic election, that's not legitimate.
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:44.580]  They can decide to start a war. They can decide to bring on a much bigger government under
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:50.900]  say Bush or under Obama, the two sides of the same rotten coin. But that doesn't mean
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:57.060]  self-government. Well, we believe in the self-government. So sometimes in American history, traditionally
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:01.100]  you have, yes, people voting in local elections and that sort of thing. But that's not the
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:07.140]  same as a mass national democracy, where you have a mass national media running things
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:14.000]  for the government, where we're given no choice, where it's creep A versus creep B. That's
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  American democracy.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.980]  That's right. They financed two fake choices that are really the same flavor of cyanide
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:25.940]  filled Kool-Aid and then ram it through. The republic puts absolute blocks in. You can't
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:29.980]  take the guns. You can't make somebody a slave. Then they argue, well, there were slaves,
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:34.140]  but it was the proper interpretation of the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:39.020]  and Constitution that ended up banning it. The media, they put the original constitution,
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:44.220]  as you know, to ban slavery, but they couldn't get it through then. It took more time, but
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:48.220]  it was the idea that was finally implemented. And again, the Bill of Rights doesn't give
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:53.500]  you your rights, folks. The Constitution doesn't. It points out what's already there organic.
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:58.140]  Lou Rockwell of LouRockwell.com is our guest. I want to come back and get into the serious
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.100]  situation and so much more.

[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:34.140]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.980]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:43.660]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments,
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:50.380]  yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:56.220]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237. Secure
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:22:00.380]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:05.500]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:10.660]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:14.940]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:19.420]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are.
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:24.340]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:29.220]  Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:33.660]  of your food supply with eFoods Direct. Be prepared before you need it. With nutrient-dense
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:38.500]  food you can store for up to 25 years. You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:42.340]  you. Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, durable foods out there from

[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:04.260]  Proteins are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids have to be delivered to your body
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:08.100]  in the shape that nature gave them if they are to be used to create new proteins in your
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.840]  body. Just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall, so
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:18.060]  too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins. Giving your body
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:22.820]  an undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health. One World Way is
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:28.720]  an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other. You see, heating bends and twists amino acids
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:34.420]  and all-whey protein powders we've investigated and most proteins you consume are heated.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:39.220]  With our true cool process, you now have a choice with One World Way. My name is Daniel.
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:45.380]  I'm 34 years old. When I started using One World Way, I weighed 228 pounds. Now, after
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:50.340]  two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds. This is my ideal weight. I've noticed an increase
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:57.260]  in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency. Call 888-988-3325
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:24:03.180]  or visit Oneworldway.com.
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:07.860]  Alex Jones here back live. You know what excites me about people like Lou Rockwell, Ron Paul,
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:12.220]  but also so many other people out there, especially young people? Everybody's starting their own
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:18.780]  radio shows, their own news shows. We post and link to the reports that Lou Rockwell
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:24.420]  and his crew are putting out. They're becoming very popular. All of us have to just engage
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:29.660]  the globalist, engage the corporate kleptocrats that use big government to control markets
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:32.300]  and shut down their competition and domesticate people.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:37.140]  Now, the next segment's a long segment. I wanna get into gold, Syria, where he sees
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:42.100]  the world going, where he sees the Republican Party going. Is there any opposition within
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:47.700]  that system? Where does Lou Rockwell see the future going in specifics? Cuz he is a very
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:56.140]  astute political mind. But first, here is an MSNBC host, Perry. Remember a month ago,
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:25:00.420]  she came out and said, your children belong to everybody.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:04.640]  And they're selling this idea to where now in Austin, people come up to us and say we
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:09.860]  shouldn't have three kids in Whole Foods. They're telling their forces, get aggressive.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:15.440]  Obama's telling his anti-gun forces, get aggressive. Go out and get in people's faces. See, they
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:21.100]  need grassroots support. And they're definitely becoming more authoritarian. They've set up
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:28.260]  this SecureCorps, AmeriCorps, StasiForce. They're announcing they're spying on everybody
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:31.700]  and saying if someone says they hate the government, call the police on them.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:38.000]  I mean, that's why I start ranting. These are dangerous creeps. Let's play the clip.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.100]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children. So part of it is we
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:46.180]  have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:49.820]  kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:53.860]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:57.860]  better investments. Melissa Harris Perry, that's a promo. They
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:06.940]  still run on MSNBC. I mean, this is so unprecedented. Again, why are they doubling down? Why does
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:11.000]  the FBI come out of the Boston bombing and say don't look at other evidence, don't look
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.140]  at other photos of clearly a drill happening?
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:18.780]  I mean, I think they are losing touch. Lou Rockwell.
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:23.380]  First of all, this woman is lying. I guess like every phrase out of her mouth is a lie
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:29.360]  because they don't actually believe that your children or my children belong to the community.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.420]  They believe they belong to the government. They don't believe they belong to our next
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:36.060]  door neighbors or the people in the town we live in.
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:40.020]  They believe they belong to the government. And indeed, our children have belonged to
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:43.740]  the government, according to the so-called law, for a very long time.
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:46.460]  That's right. If the child protective services or some family
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:50.580]  court judge or whatever can decide to take away your children on a whim. So yes, your
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:54.300]  children don't belong to you as far as the government is concerned. Of course, as far
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:58.140]  as God is concerned, as far as human nature is concerned, of course, children belong to
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:03.980]  their parents. Of course, children don't belong to the quote unquote community, let alone
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:10.000]  to the rapacious and predatory government. But this is a totalitarian meme. They're pushing
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.500]  totalitarianism right across the board. And when I can stomach watching MSNBC, which is
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:21.560]  not very often, I noticed that these advertisements that they show are the most totalitarian things
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.560]  they have on there.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:26.860]  I mean, they're just openly Soviet-like. And so we need to know the enemy.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:31.200]  Well, that's my question. That's my question is why, for those that don't know history,
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.700]  this is direct Soviet. I mean, this is the stuff. In fact, I mean, even the Soviet Union
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:37.260]  wasn't that over the top in a lot of them.
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:41.020]  And Hitler didn't say that the children belong to the government. But of course, the Soviets
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.020]  did.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:47.300]  So why are they going haywire in an orgy of government worship?
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:52.340]  Well, they feel this is the time to push. And I think part of the reason is they feel
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:56.780]  they're making progress under Obama and they made progress under Bush. But they also are
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:28:02.500]  worried. They're also scared. This is why they're saying things that are actually crazy,
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:07.500]  a little too revealing of their real agenda. So this is good for us. It's good that this
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:11.020]  woman is making this kind of a statement, as you know, thanks to you and others that
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:14.000]  went around the whole World Wide Web.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.460]  So this is good. It's good that we know that these people have these kinds of ideas and
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:22.580]  what they want to put into effect through, of course, the government, which Obama praises
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:28.260]  as the great locus of progress. It's actually the locus of violence. It's the headquarters
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:29.860]  of violence in society.
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:31.380]  Look at North Korea.
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:35.220]  Well, look at the U.S. We don't have to go to North Korea. We don't have to go to the
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:39.380]  other bad countries. There are plenty of bad countries in the world. Let's concentrate
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:43.940]  on our own country as you do. Let's look at what the U.S. government is doing to us, what
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:47.920]  the U.S. government is planning to do to us. I mean, North Korea is not trying to read
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:48.920]  my e-mails.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:54.560]  Absolutely. America, the globalists that run America is the monkey on our back.
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.180]  They keep talking, you know, of course, they talk about North Korea, North Korea, North
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:02.140]  Korea, and then it drops. So it's gone away. And I guess it'll come back again. North Korea
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:03.740]  is not the problem for us.
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:08.180]  No, no, I agree with you. I'm just saying if Obama loves a total state, look at North
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:13.240]  Korea, where they can't even manufacture their own cars. Everywhere government becomes total,
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.980]  everything collapses into the Dark Ages.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:21.340]  Yeah, I think I think that maybe they who knows, maybe they've learned from the experience
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:25.420]  of the Soviet Union or the experience of the other communist countries or North Korea,
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:30.620]  whatever, that the the power elite, the oligarchs, are not well off enough in that kind of a
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:36.020]  system. So they actually want a fascist system. The U.S. system is fascist. They want to increase
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:38.780]  the fascism. So communism has never been.
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:42.260]  Stay there. I want to give you the floor when we come back to describe what the American
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:47.500]  system has become versus the real American system. Then we'll look at the war in Syria,
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:50.100]  gold, Ron Paul and so much more.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:57.100]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:27.100]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:31:07.100]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:35.140]  I'm told in two days the channel changes. Pull up that email for me. I want to give
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:41.300]  the channel outright. It's 244, right, John? Yeah, it's a 244. That changes in a couple
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:50.020]  days from 166. The entire channel is moving over there, not just our broadcast. Again,
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:55.020]  Lou Rockwell is our guest. I'm going back to him in a moment. I want to ask him about
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:59.820]  Boston and the new idea. In fact, I sent you an IM this morning, guys. Do you have it?
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:05.900]  I sent you the text of what somebody said about this is how the professionals keep us
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:09.980]  safe. Will you guys print me that off the instant message I sent you, Chris? Because
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:13.900]  I want to read that on air later where the guys like this is how professionals keep you
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:18.420]  safe coming to every house, grabbing your wife by the hair, shoving you down the stairs,
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:20.740]  throwing guns at you where you're all suspects.
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:24.820]  Any of them could have been accomplices. Well, the cops could have been accomplices. But
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:29.140]  I'm not supposed to say that even though government has a history nine times out of ten of being
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:33.860]  behind the terror attack. But that's a separate issue. The new issue of the magazine, speaking
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:40.420]  of issues, will sell out. You can buy it in bulk or get a subscription of the May issue
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:45.700]  false flags, exposes the history of government sponsored and provocateur terror.
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:49.500]  That's in the Second Amendment and so much more. It's a double cover. It's got a cover
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:57.560]  on both sides of the magazine as well. And it has three free big bumper stickers in it.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:03.420]  That's about 400,000 bumper stickers total. They printed over 100,000 of these. Imagine
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:08.420]  what this will do if you put them up in legal and lawful areas. So get those today.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:12.420]  They're also on the streets of Austin and San Antonio and other cities that put them
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:15.960]  out on the streets as well. So if you see them, get them and give them to your friends
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:21.500]  and family and get them on your cars because it'll have a massive effect. Now, Lou, I want
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:28.020]  you to walk through, you've got the communist and socialist models.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:31.760]  But what I see us having is a corporatist model. As Mussolini said, that's the definition
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.040]  of fascism. You correctly peg it. So as the head of the Von Mies Institute and a man who
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:43.340]  studied history, I see them using socialism grassroots to socialize one sector of society
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:48.820]  and then play it off against the free market sector that is parasited to death at over
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:52.100]  50% and France is over 80.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:58.000]  But I see them segueing where they're just exempt from our laws overseas. The mega corporations
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.620]  get the lion's share of the taxpayer money in bailouts and government contracts. So it's
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:08.980]  almost like socialism and communism grassroots with a police state, with offshore fascist
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:15.980]  exempt above it. So it's even worse than fascism. What would you call this system they're establishing?
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:21.300]  I mean, I agree, it's more akin to fascism, but I mean, what do we really call it?
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:26.540]  Well I think, Alex, you're right, it's a corporatist system. And we just have to look at Obamacare,
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:31.620]  unlike say the system in Britain or France or other countries where the state directly
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:36.880]  owns or Canada directly owns and runs the medical system, which of course is horrendous.
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:41.580]  We have a fascist system. So you had the actual Obamacare bill written by the big insurance
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:46.940]  companies, by the big hospitals and especially by big pharma run for their benefit. So it's
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:52.620]  the big corporations, big government in alliance against the rest of us as tax victims and
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:54.060]  victims otherwise.
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:59.200]  So I think that is the model and I think that whether we look at the national security state,
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:03.940]  which is all these big companies who were involved with the government in surveilling
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:09.060]  us, whether we look at the military industrial complex, any other aspect, what Mussolini
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:15.820]  said, the combination of corporatism and the state means fascism. So I think that's the
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:21.620]  American system, began really with Franklin Roosevelt, whose new deal was based on Mussolini's
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:26.500]  economic program and it's gotten worse ever since. And of course, especially since 9-11,
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:31.380]  it's been galloping worse. So I still think, though, that most people, whether they're
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:36.780]  in Boston or otherwise, are sheeple. It's too bad, which weren't the case. But everything
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:41.980]  is done by minorities for both good and for evil. So all we don't need the majority. The
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:49.160]  majority is just go along to get along. But there are minorities who are for, of course,
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:53.300]  this state and making everything worse. There are people who are openly for a totalitarian
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:38:00.580]  need. I mean, for something equivalent to Mussolini or Hitler or or Stalin or those
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:05.740]  sorts of systems, they would use different words. They use different rhetoric, Mao Zedong,
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:11.020]  as you're saying. But they don't they don't, of course, ever use the direct rhetoric of
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:15.620]  those regimes. But that's the sort of thing they'd like. And then there are people who
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:22.720]  oppose that, who are knowledgeable, who understand what's happening, who read, who think independently,
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.220]  who don't let their opinions be controlled by Fox News or CNN or MSNBC or the rest of
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:33.660]  the proudness of this current regime or the focus of Bay of doctors or whatever.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.100]  They don't let their minds be controlled by that. They think independently and they think
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:41.640]  critically. They teach their children to do the same. This is the hope of America. Indeed,
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:45.860]  it's the hope of the world that in other countries, too, there are people like this. So I think
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:50.060]  more and more people, young people, especially Ron Paul, is the main reason for this has
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:55.340]  woken up young people in this country and all over the world to the problems we face.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:39:00.260]  So I think it's a race. This has been the race, by the way, since the Garden of Eden
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:06.440]  or so shortly after the Garden of Eden between those who want power for the violence prone
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:11.940]  and the killers and those who want the power to be with the families, with individuals,
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:17.580]  with communities and businesses and peaceful activities, with the arts of peace as versus
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:23.980]  the arts of war. That's right. Successful, smart people can't
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:27.960]  keep people away and have so many friends and so many opportunities that you tend to
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:34.720]  just become solitary, whereas losers crave and enjoy abuse of power that for someone
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:41.620]  who's powerful is nauseating. I mean, I mean, seeing people exercise undue power and abuse
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:46.620]  people is abhorrent to a normal person. That's right. But the problem is we don't we don't
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:50.660]  lust after power. So we always end up under scum.
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:53.460]  We don't want to we don't want to run the next door neighbor. We're not going to run
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:57.180]  the next door town or the next country or whatever. But of course, there are people
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:02.780]  who lust to kill, lust to rule. They enjoy sending young men out to kill and be killed.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:06.940]  They get a charge out of it. Those are the people who tend to rise in government.
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:11.020]  And of course, they're they're the scum of the earth. So there are enemies. They are
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:17.420]  the parasites, as Obama indirectly described them, who are just a pure cost to the human
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:23.340]  race. They're not a benefit. They're a pure cost. And those of us who understand that,
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:27.020]  who oppose it, not with violence, because, of course, they've got all the guns and the
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:33.340]  tanks and the bombs and the sarin gas and and the biological warfare and so that's the
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:38.460]  government. So we we oppose them with our minds by refusing to consent, by educating
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:43.100]  ourselves by finding others who agree with us, trying to persuade others.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:47.500]  And in fact, the more we know, the more people will come to us for an explanation of what
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.500]  the heck is going on and what to do about it.
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:52.820]  Let me ask you this before we get into Syria, and we're gonna have open phones the next
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:59.260]  hour after Lou leaves us listeners. In your gut, looking at the geopolitical moves, what's
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:05.620]  happening, seeing the accelerated degeneration of the Western elite, whether even cutting
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:14.140]  each other's throats politically, the establishments becoming more delusional, which you see in
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:16.500]  the bottom of a decadent phase.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:20.420]  What do you expect to see happening? Cuz I have an article right here out of Rolling
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:26.900]  Stone from last week. Everything is rigged. The biggest price fixing scandal ever. The
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:31.940]  Illuminati were amateurs. The second huge financial scandal of the year reveals the
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:38.540]  real international conspiracy. There's no price the banks can't fix, and it goes into
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:44.740]  how the stocks, the bonds, the healthcare, the interest rates, everything is fixed by
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:51.140]  16 too big to fail banks, it's really about six mega banks that set the precedent.
[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:54.740]  And then it just goes, he goes, I apologize to the conspiracy theorist, you're correct.
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:42:00.020]  Well, and it's a 14 page article. Well, I mean, you see articles about people colluding
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:05.900]  to rob a bank, that's a conspiracy. The idea that big organized business isn't in a conspiracy
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:10.020]  with government throughout history, isn't the greatest danger throughout history, you
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.260]  ignore that at your folly.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:17.380]  But it's not just this article, I've seen, let's not exaggerate, 15, 20, a whole bunch
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:23.960]  of articles the last week with big prestigious writers coming out and going, okay, it's true.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:31.340]  Big mega rich really do run things and they got their money by stealing it. I mean, I
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:36.320]  was talking to a reporter just the other day and he didn't even know that Glenn Beck and
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.900]  Obama had supported the banker bailout in LA.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:46.000]  I mean, this level of ignorance, what happens when the corruption gets so naked, so brazen
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.060]  that they say Mao Zedong is our hero and parents aren't parents and veterans are terrorists
[01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:57.580]  and Christians can't talk about Jesus at a commencement or in the military. I mean, this
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:03.400]  is getting so Twilight Zone, Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com that I can't believe it.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.860]  How much more nuts is it gonna get and what is the method? So and out of that, where is
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:09.740]  this going in Syria?
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:13.820]  Well here's what they face. It's true that the big banks are running everything. We live
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:20.540]  in a bankocracy in Europe and in Asia too. Big banks are extremely powerful. I wanna
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:25.980]  recommend a great essay that's free online, Murray Rothbard's Banks, Wall Street and American
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.100]  Foreign Policy.
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:31.860]  Just put that into Google and it will come up. It really explains how these various power
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:37.460]  elites operate. But they run up against the laws of reality because there are certain
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:42.140]  things they're doing that have an economic impact. No matter what they hope or think
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:46.240]  or no matter how many people they fool, the kind of money printing that is going on will
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.240]  bring them down.
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:52.340]  Of course, it's gonna hurt us too, but it will bring them down. What they're doing cannot
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:56.860]  continue. The laws of reality will prevent it. So therefore, I think they are coming
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:44:02.380]  down. The big banks, the whole financial system, because of the things they're doing, Bernanke
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:07.960]  can't actually change the laws of reality. He can't change the laws of economics. They
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.100]  apply to him just like they apply to all of us.
[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:16.100]  So the banks are all, of course, fractional reserve. The money's not there, folks. Just
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:20.620]  not only the people in Cyprus' money isn't there, your money isn't in the bank either.
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:25.540]  So the more people understand this, take their money out, try to avoid dealing with the banks,
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:32.020]  try to have private cash uses for their money and so forth. They hate ATMs, for example.
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:36.060]  They don't like you taking cash out and using it in everyday transactions. You're supposed
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:39.300]  to use checks and digital transfers.
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:45.540]  But they can't stand against the laws of economics in reality. So I would say in the long term,
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.860]  not the short term, but in the long term, we have every reason to be optimistic.
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:45:00.820]  I agree with you. Let me raise this point. Syria, the La La Land level of the government
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:05.380]  buying 2 billion, 200 million bullets, admitting it's for us in their own army documents that
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:11.620]  we've shown. Now it's over 7,000 anti-mine giant black armored vehicles I see driving
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:16.180]  around Austin. Their response is, it doesn't exist, Alex Jones is insane.
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:21.220]  Now there's congressional hearings. They're freaking out, still saying, Alex Jones, he's
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:25.380]  nuts. It's his fault. I mean, articles every day, as if I have something to do with it.
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:29.940]  Sure, we broke it and forced it out there with Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com. And
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:32.060]  you say, what does that do with Syria?
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:37.220]  Then you've got them saying, we've got to invade Syria because Al Qaeda might get chemical
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:43.420]  weapons when our government in NATO two years ago began inserting Al Qaeda in to commit
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:50.180]  war crimes. And then they call Obama a peacenik. I mean, it's reaching La La level. What do
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:56.820]  you make of Israel now going into day two, day three of blowing up military barracks?
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:46:01.580]  And then our media is like, how dare Syria? They're so violent. I mean, it really is entering
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:03.780]  a cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs level.
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:09.120]  No, I've noticed any number of stories saying, how dare Syria say this as an act of war?
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:15.060]  How dare they say that? So when Israel bombs them, so let's look at what Syria is. I'm
[01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:19.060]  not defending the government of Syria any more than I defend any other government, but
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:24.860]  it's the last secular Arab government in the world. It's not Islamicist. They don't have
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:30.380]  any Al Qaeda types there. So what does the US, Turkey, Israel, France and Britain do?
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:37.260]  They create a group of rebels in Turkey at the various US Air Force bases in Turkey,
[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:43.740]  as Sebelle Edmonds pointed out. They're put into Syria. They're armed by the US and its
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:48.740]  cohorts. Probably they were given sarin gas because the sarin gas that was used, as even
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:56.260]  a UN official said today, was used by the rebels apparently, not by the Syrian government.
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:01.740]  This group is all Al Qaeda types, which the US has always used Al Qaeda. It used it against
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:06.460]  the Russians in Afghanistan, bin Laden and funded by the Saudi Arabians. They used it
[01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:13.980]  against Gaddafi, who was also a secular Arab government in Libya. They're using it in Syria
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:20.460]  now to make trouble, to wreck, to destroy. So the Al Qaeda people in Syria have said,
[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:26.200]  when we take over, we're going to kill all the Alawites. That's the small, very unusual
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:30.940]  Muslim sect that is most of the governing people in Syria. We're going to drive out
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:34.520]  all the Christians. It's already happened in Iraq. These are countries that have had
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:39.460]  Christian communities from the time of the apostles, and they're being destroyed and
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:45.020]  driven out. And then they said, so they're going to just have an Islamic state. So why
[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:50.840]  is the US supporting that? Why is trouble? Well, yeah, I mean, they think we're so dumb,
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:55.420]  they want to grope my wife and children to fly while they publicly run Al Qaeda. And
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:59.380]  it turns out the bombers were watched for five years, the supposed convicted bombers
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:04.980]  already, who they said confessed the one when he's in the hospital with no proof, overthrowing
[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:05.980]  the Sixth Amendment.
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:11.500]  I mean, Lou, it's crazy that they're saying, give your rights up because of Al Qaeda, while
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:15.620]  our government, I've said Obama is the global head of Al Qaeda right now.
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:21.820]  Well, you know, they find, unfortunately, American people will buy the most unbelievably
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:27.340]  stupid and low level propaganda. I mean, you know, the all the arguments they're making
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:32.240]  against Iran, which are all lies, are exactly the same thing they said against Iraq. They
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:39.860]  just changed the word Iraq to Iran. And, you know, apparently most people believe it. However,
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:43.100]  even though they're not being directly taxed for these wars, which would be the normal
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:49.060]  cause of war weariness, because it was everything's being printed up at the Fed, still, I think
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:51.820]  more and more Americans are tired of the wars.
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:56.360]  They'd like to get out of Afghanistan and they don't want to go into Iran. So the more
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:03.140]  that we can we can stoke these feelings, the more that we can promote the cause of peace
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:07.340]  and Ron Paul's new Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity is going to be a big
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:12.580]  factor in this. The more we can promote the cause of peace, the more trouble they're going
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:13.580]  to have.
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:17.700]  The more trouble they're going to have with, you know, again, Syria, maybe poor Syria's
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:22.680]  out is gone, but with Iran and with other countries they'd like to target. So we have
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.260]  to promote the cause of peace.
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:32.720]  Sure. I mean, what about what about resisting in a peaceful way, civil disobedience? I mean,
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:36.780]  I think it's time to go into the airports with big printouts admitting that our government
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:41.420]  runs Al-Qaeda and saying, how dare them want to grope us and violate our rights?
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:46.180]  It's an act of domination. They're flipping the Al-Qaeda script onto libertarians now
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:51.540]  saying we're the threat. How dare you, the government that runs Al-Qaeda, then say you
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:56.340]  want to grope me looking for Al-Qaeda when you have the history of running these groups?
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:50:01.660]  I mean, I mean, that's what I'm getting at here is I want to call them on their hoax,
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:02.980]  call them on their baloney.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:07.860]  Well, I certainly believe in the principle of civil disobedience. We all have that right.
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:12.820]  I wouldn't actually tell anybody to do it because, of course, you take a chance of going
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:17.660]  to jail. And the jails are, you know, the U.S., as I pointed out earlier, is the capital
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:25.100]  of jailery in the entire planet. And these are vicious, vicious cages that they put human
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:29.720]  beings in. So I would never tell anybody to do that because of what the consequences are.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:34.020]  But I certainly would support anybody taking their their own rights into their hand and
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:38.240]  practicing civil disobedience. We have that right.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:44.300]  I hear you, by the way, Adam Kokash, frequent guest of this show. It's on WorldNetDaily.com
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:49.700]  linked up on DrudgeReport.com. Guys, blurb WorldNetDaily. Get it posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:53.600]  He's doing what everybody's always asked me to do. He says he's going to lead an armed
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:57.980]  march on D.C. July 4th. And I'm going to tell you why I've always been against that when
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:01.780]  we come back. Stay with us.

[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:11.100]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:15.380]  that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could

[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:25.300]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[01:53:56.740 --> 01:54:19.620]  on BenzDiscountSupply.com. All right, CNN News is reporting radio host to lead armed
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:25.480]  march on D.C. July 4th to put government on notice that we won't be intimidated. I know
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:32.300]  Adam Kokesh. I think he's overall a good guy. But, you know, he does stunts like, you know,
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:36.360]  smoking pot on the air and stuff, which I get that's his right to do it. But it just
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:40.900]  kind of turns into party time. And I'm not criticizing him. He's been mildly critical
[01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:44.260]  of me in the past. I really could care less. But I'm going to call him. I'm gonna try to
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:48.060]  get him on next hour or if anybody can get a hold of him. We just got a cell phone number
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:52.440]  and Skype. Tell Adam I want to get him to pop in. I have been asked to do this over
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:56.380]  and over and over again in my 18 years on air. And there are people that did this back
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:59.820]  in the mid 90s claimed they would and it turned out it was basically a Fed running and it
[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:01.460]  was a way to try to radicalize.
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:06.340]  I don't think Adam's doing that. It's a libertarian deal to open carry. And now that I've had
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:11.960]  a chance to read the article, they plan to march from the Arlington National Cemetery
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:18.580]  in Virginia to the bridge. And then when the feds stop them, if they stop them, then they'll
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:24.380]  turn back. So I mean, I guess it's a publicity stunt for the Second Amendment to point out
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.720]  that you can't have guns in the Capitol.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:32.580]  So I guess I mean, my point is I've never done it because this is the type of time that
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:38.700]  they would provocateur and send in somebody to stage something and then blame us. If you're
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:43.780]  aware of that and have cameras showing that, it could backfire on the globalist. It's just
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:48.700]  I haven't ever done this, even though sure it put my name all over TV, bigger than Piers
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:55.820]  Morgan, bigger than all the rest of it, but I personally just have a bad feeling about
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:56.820]  it.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:58.540]  Lou Rockwell, what is your feeling about this?
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:02.640]  I think it's a very bad idea. First of all, I just think that violence or the threat of
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:06.820]  violence, that's the government. That's not us. We're the people of peace. Yes, we have
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:11.100]  the right to self defense, but not the right to offense. So I think also they're gonna
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:15.620]  be, this is gonna be the Fourth of July, they're gonna be a lot of civilians around there as
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:21.500]  they might call them who potentially collateral damage if there's any shooting, quote unquote
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.980]  collateral damage, we would call that manslaughter or murder.
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:29.340]  So I think it's a very bad idea. I don't, you know, must have made the FBI's day to
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:34.300]  see this happen. I mean, I think and hope, however, nobody will be stupid enough to do
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:39.100]  it because they're just playing into the government's hands, playing into the media's hands. And
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:43.660]  by the way, this is not a libertarian thing. This is, you know, conservatives could be
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:48.220]  in back of it. Any anybody who's interested in the, you know, in the sort of things that
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:49.220]  Adam is interested in.
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:53.900]  It's not necessary. I want to want to reject the libertarian label for this. It's a very
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:58.060]  bad idea, but I really think it'll never happen. I think this I think we've seen the extent
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:02.820]  of it. Why would somebody why would somebody join in this? You know, if we think of, you
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:08.500]  know, the worst jails in the country outside of Guantanamo are in the D.C. area.
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:12.620]  You know, folks, you don't want to let them put you in one of those jails. I mean, it's
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:19.300]  a horrific experience. It can change your life for the worse. And we shouldn't be taking
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:24.660]  you know, you don't take a bar. It's just a very, very bad idea. And I hope to goodness
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:28.980]  it never comes off. And my guess is it will never come off. And as you say, it gets a
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:32.900]  lot of publicity. Of course, Drudge put it up. It's now all over the world and being
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:34.700]  described as a libertarian effort.
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:40.340]  This is not a libertarian effort. This is something else. And I think we ought not to
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:43.580]  support it, join in it or approve of it in any way.
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:47.300]  Well, Lou, I mean, I've got to say this. I think when people like go to state capitals
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:51.300]  with guns or when I storm the capital without guns, it shows we're in power. They call it
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:55.220]  storming it. We just didn't have permission to go have a protest. I don't get permits
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:57.660]  because it's it's it's it's turning a right.
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:01.020]  That's another thing. But you're not bringing, you know, a thousand people with rifles to
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:05.040]  the state. No, no, listen, I absolutely I totally hear what you're saying. I hear that
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.920]  you're saying they can manipulate it. What I'm saying is I understand the libertarian
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:14.080]  right and the open carry movement is something that shows people that guns aren't illegal.
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.540]  I write not exercise is a right that's lost.
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:21.140]  We do five more minutes with you on Ron Paul. I just talked to Adam Kokesh while you were
[01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:26.620]  talking. I got him on the phone. He's coming up at the five after break next hour here
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:31.360]  on air. This is breaking. And so we'll have that video for everybody and we'll have a
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:37.560]  video report that can be embedded at DrudgeReport.com. We'll have that up at Infowars.com live streaming
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.420]  with Adam Kokesh coming up.

[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:57.040]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird

[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:22.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.860]  After Lou Rockwell leaves us and Adam Kokesh leaves us, we're connected to him on Skype
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:43.560]  right now, I'll have time to play Ron Paul from Chile, basically talking about how this
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:50.260]  could be the collapse of society and how government is basically destroying our society. Similar
[02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:57.260]  things were also said by the leader of UKIP, Nigel Farage, but Ron Paul and Jim Rogers on
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:03.000]  government, quote, they'll use force and they'll use intimidation. And you know, I think the
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:09.680]  good news here is whether it's Lou Rockwell, Alex Jones, Ron Paul, Nigel Farage, Rogers,
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:14.240]  people that are into liberty worldwide, this is popular.
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:20.160]  And it's very, very exciting that liberty is rising while tyranny is becoming so unpopular.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:25.020]  I think that's why Lou Rockwell, in closing, I want to get your take on this, why we see
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:30.040]  them saying, of course, the state did everything. Of course, the state owns your kids. Of course,
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:34.400]  the state made the sun come up this morning. I think they're trying to hide their behavior
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:40.160]  in plain view as some desperate attempt at normalcy bias. Do you think that's working?
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.320]  No, it's not working. And again, I think Ron Paul is the key reason he's got a worldwide
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:50.640]  movement, not only among young people and us older people in this country, too, but
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:56.320]  all over the world. And he's doing, you know, all the usual suspects said, well, he's retired,
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:59.720]  thank goodness, now he's gone, forget him. But of course, he's stepped up everything
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:04.100]  he's doing and what he believes in, that is fighting against the Federal Reserve, fighting
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:10.880]  against big government, fighting for our liberties, fighting for the cause of peace and against
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:11.880]  war is new.
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:17.560]  Again, his new Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, his podcasts, many, many speeches.
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:22.480]  He is so in demand on college campuses all over this country, two and three times a week.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:26.740]  He's speaking at college campuses. It doesn't get publicity, but he's influencing young
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:31.560]  people and he's got even more exciting plans that haven't been announced yet that are going
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:35.040]  to be a worldwide bombshell for goodness.
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:40.360]  So Ron Paul, keep doing it and those who are interested in Ron and all the others, Alex
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:45.320]  and everybody else who's part of this liberty movement, we are on the march. The other side
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:51.400]  is sick. It's sick in every sense. It's decaying and I don't believe they have the stamina
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:57.280]  to stick with it. We have the young on our side, have hope, learn about what's going
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:06.160]  on and be a moral warrior for peace and freedom and don't march on Washington with a gun.
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:12.080]  Well, listen, we're gonna have Adam Kokesh up next. So what do you want? Cuz I will pose
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:16.240]  the question or statement to him. What do you wanna say to Adam Kokesh about his plan
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:19.080]  for an armed march on Washington?
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:23.640]  Well Adam's a very smart guy, he's an interesting guy, but I would say have a peaceful march.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:29.720]  He wants to gather people on the 4th of July to talk about gun rights or whatever, more
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:37.440]  power to him. But to sort of give the FBI and the CIA and all of the Department of Homeland
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:42.840]  Security and the rest of these evil agencies a present on the 4th of July, I think is not
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:43.840]  a good idea.
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:50.000]  And again, why do you think it's a bad idea? Because there are a lot of open carry rallies
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.520]  out there that have reestablished the Second Amendment. And I agree with that, but I also
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.520]  just have your concern, not about Kokesh.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:04.640]  You're gonna stay away from Mordor. Washington DC is the locus of evil. It's not like a regular
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:09.720]  city. This is very bad people there. Stay away from Washington DC if you wanna do it
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:16.120]  elsewhere in the country where we have open carry rights and so forth. Okay, fine, do
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:20.900]  it. And these are peaceful and nobody's looking to shoot the state legislators or whatever.
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:26.420]  But you know what they will say in Washington. They'll say this is aimed at overthrowing
[02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:27.420]  the government.
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:32.560]  These people are potentially guilty of treason. They'll all be arrested, they'll be brutalized.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:37.560]  And the media will use this to say, look, all those libertarians, they wanna shoot the
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:41.600]  government. So that is what's going to happen even though we don't wanna shoot the government.
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:46.920]  You do know that that is the government's weapon. The government shoots us, but we use
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:51.640]  the weapons of peace and of intelligence and of knowledge against them.
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:56.760]  All right, Lou Rockwell, thank you for joining us, lourockwell.com. I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:00.840]  Adam Kokesh, straight ahead.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:06.340]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:11.680]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:15.920]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:21.160]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:25.900]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:31.040]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:34.980]  with e Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it. With nutrient dense food, you can

[02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:24.780]  Monday through Friday from 11 AM until 2 PM Central, we are here live back weeknights

[02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:39.900]  prisonplanet.tv. Now joining us from Virginia is Adam Kokesh. He is a American activist
[02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:48.820]  and talk radio host. Adamvsthaman.com is his news website. And I saw up on drudgereport.com
[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:56.660]  about an hour ago and we'll punch that up on screen the headline.
[02:08:56.660 --> 02:09:04.140]  Radio host who lead armed march on DC July 4th to put government on notice that we won't
[02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:11.860]  be intimidated and that is CNS News. Now they plan to march from Virginia to the bridge
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:20.580]  and here to give us specific details first. Here on the Alex Jones Show is Adam Kokesh.
[02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:24.740]  Again, a long time guest of this broadcast. I can count him as a friend and he's done
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:29.140]  a lot of other big political events. They say there's no free speech allowed in DC.
[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:33.140]  I've had him tell me no cameras allowed even on the mall. Adam's gone out famously and
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:38.260]  danced at a monument and then arrested for that. Slammed to the ground, brutalized. I
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:43.620]  got to say this, he is a Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Fallujah and he has a lot of courage.
[02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:48.100]  I have never done this. People have asked me to do this many times. I've never done
[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:54.140]  it because I'm concerned they'll send in provocateurs and stage something to demonize gun owners.
[02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:58.380]  I believe in open carry. I believe we have the right to do it. Doing it around the nation
[02:09:58.380 --> 02:10:02.060]  has really shown that there is a right to keep and bear arms. A lot of people don't
[02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:06.020]  even think there is a second amendment. But I got to tell you, Adam, I'm worried about
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:16.060]  you. I'll probably come or send a reporter to this. You've got serious guts to do this
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:20.280]  because I know what the establishment's capable of and also know you always do what you say
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:21.280]  you're going to do.
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:24.740]  So Adam Kakesh, tell us what's happening and tell us what you're planning.
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:28.660]  Alex, thank you so much for having me on and thank you so much for being supportive of
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:32.500]  this. I know it's an issue that's very near and dear to you and so many of your audience
[02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:36.420]  and it's very important that we stand up. And I think this is the time people have gotten
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:39.500]  to the end of their ropes and they're saying this is it. We're going to put it on the line.
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:44.620]  We're going to see what happens. And if anything, this event is quite subtle, really the subtlest
[02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:49.220]  way possible that we can assert our right to be armed as human beings. And this really
[02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:54.300]  goes to the heart of the gun control issue. Is it about guns or is it about control? And
[02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:58.060]  what we're going to be doing is gathering at the national cemetery on Independence Day
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:00.940]  in the morning and mustering into a formation.
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:04.600]  We hope to make sure that this is done in the safest and most visible and obvious way
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:09.260]  possible. And if I have to personally inspect every single individual carrying in that formation
[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:13.900]  to ensure that that's what it is, that's what's going to happen. We will only invite individuals
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:18.420]  at least who are not law enforcement officers to be there with only a rifle or a shotgun
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:23.040]  slung across their back where their hands are not anywhere near it. And it can be made
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:27.460]  completely clear that they are coming in peace while asserting their right to be armed. We
[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:31.580]  are going to march across the bridge, the Memorial Bridge into the District of Columbia
[02:11:31.580 --> 02:11:33.740]  where open carry is not permitted.
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:38.300]  March down Independence Avenue around the Capitol, around the Supreme Court and then
[02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:42.460]  up Pennsylvania Avenue around the White House, back down to Constitution Avenue and back
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:47.140]  peacefully to Virginia. What I'm going to be doing is coordinating with law enforcement.
[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:50.820]  My recommendation to them is they give us an escort and they allow us to conduct our
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:56.300]  march peacefully in an orderly manner and make it clear why we are there. However, should
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:59.940]  they decide to say that we will not be welcome in the District of Criminals and mortar on
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:04.220]  the Potomac, we will make it clear to the country and to the world that free people
[02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:10.020]  are not welcome in the capital of what is supposed to be the freest nation on earth,
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:14.700]  which we know to not be true now for many, many years. And yet so many Americans seem
[02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:16.480]  to labor under this illusion.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:22.600]  And just recently, speaking in Mexico, incidentally, President Obama said, I think many of you
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:27.700]  know that in America our Constitution guarantees our individual right to bear arms and as president
[02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:32.620]  I swore an oath to uphold that right and I always will. Well, we're going to find out
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:39.080]  on Independence Day 2013 whether President Obama and the law enforcement officers that
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:43.380]  enforce his will in the District of Columbia are oath keepers or oath breakers and whether
[02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:47.140]  they're actually going to stand up for the Constitution and the Second Amendment to which
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:49.180]  they swore an oath.
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:54.420]  Should there be any meeting of physical resistance, I have declared that at least for myself and
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:58.940]  I will ask everybody who is attending as a free individual to follow the same principles
[02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:06.020]  that if we are going to be confronted physically, we are not going to physically challenge anyone.
[02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:10.700]  We are not going to cause any harm. We are going to conduct a peaceful event. And should
[02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:16.100]  we be confronted by law enforcement, even to the point of meeting physical resistance,
[02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:21.020]  if they do not create an immediate threat to life and limb, we will submit to the physical
[02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:25.540]  will of the government as it represents what it does today and hope that we can reach out
[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:26.940]  to those behind it.
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:31.820]  We can reach out to those who think that they should be able to affect the actions of others
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:35.340]  through the coercion of government rather than the persuasion that we as libertarians
[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:40.300]  hold superior. And we are going to find out where this country stands come this Independence
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:41.300]  Day.
[02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:47.460]  Now, Adam, what about the concern that I raised that the media is going to try to spin this
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:54.620]  that it is an armed revolt against Mordor on the Potomac or kind of like the North Korean
[02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:58.780]  capital where only the government can be armed. I understand, you know, you are doing this
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:03.160]  to exercise the fact that we do have a Second Amendment and that the Supreme Court has even
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:08.820]  ruled that they cannot keep people from owning guns in D.C., but still the district does
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:13.020]  not comply with the Supreme Court. So I understand historically you're in the right, but what
[02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:17.860]  about Lou Rockwell, the Von Mies Institute, libertarian icon, we all know him well, who
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:18.900]  was on earlier.
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:23.220]  He thinks this is a very bad idea. I get why you're doing it. I know you're a good guy.
[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:29.140]  I support you yourself. I just know that this is like a present to a lot of provocateurs.
[02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:34.880]  How do you stop them from sending in a mentally ill person or somebody they've set up to try
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:39.680]  to demonize the entire Second Amendment movement? I mean, obviously, justice be done. May the
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.780]  heavens fall. But, you know, that's not your problem. That's not my problem. But you've
[02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:47.060]  obviously thought that through, Alex.
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:52.820]  This is an armed revolt against the American government. Make no mistake about it. That
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:56.940]  does not change the nature of the event. And that does not change the fact that every criticism
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:01.380]  leveled against what we are planning to do would be true of any act of resistance, of
[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:06.540]  any open protest, of any act of rebellion. And to say, well, there are potential negative
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:12.840]  consequences as an excuse to cower before government does not strike me as something
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:18.500]  that would be said by someone who cares about risking what they hold dear to achieve what
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:19.700]  we hold most dear.
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:23.820]  And that is the liberty that is supposed to be a core value of this nation. And it's really
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:28.420]  disgusting to see that there are those who would use the exact same tactics that they
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:34.780]  are saying are potentials in order to derail this effort that, oh, somebody might say something
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:39.380]  bad about this. So we're gonna say something bad about it now. And I heard the criticism
[02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:44.820]  from the esteemed Mr. Rockwell suggesting that we have a peaceful event.
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:48.740]  We are having a peaceful event. And that, you know, we should be saying that-
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:52.300]  No, I get what you're saying. Let me stop you. You're saying, as a libertarian principle,
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:57.000]  it's whoever initiates the violence first. I get it. It's like Lexington and Concord,
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.180]  you know, hold your fire, don't shoot unless shot at, but, you know, stand your ground
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:03.140]  if they mean to have a war, let them have it.
[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:09.720]  And then you say this is an armed revolt. I say the government's illegitimate. It's violating
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:15.480]  our rights. But I mean, why are you calling it a armed revolt? Because that idea in law
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:21.500]  has the connotation of you're gonna be revolting with arms. I mean, I don't think having arms
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:27.220]  with you is the definition of revolting with arms. I think it signifies you're saying you're
[02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:29.740]  exercising the right to be armed.
[02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:34.940]  Well, you could split the terms there. I believe we are revolting with arms. And as you, I
[02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:40.080]  know personally, you are armed and you believe in this. And I would say that you are in revolt
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:46.340]  as well. And we saw the report just last week of the survey that 29% of Americans believe
[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:51.620]  an armed revolt will be necessary for a revolution in the next few years.
[02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:55.020]  Well, for those Americans who see that it is potentially necessary, I have some news
[02:16:55.020 --> 02:17:00.100]  for you. It's already happening. It's already begun. And if you think that we are not in
[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:04.500]  the midst of a revolution, I would ask you to simply look around and look just ever so
[02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:08.820]  slightly past the mainstream media narrative to question what's really going on and see
[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:12.680]  that there are people in this country who are facing violence at the hands of government.
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:15.580]  There are people worse all over the world, all over the planet.
[02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:20.940]  I agree. Government run by special interests is the problem. But I mean, what you're saying
[02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:32.960]  here is right in the historical context. I think Lou Rockwell is concerned because undoubtedly
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:38.140]  this will probably not end well. I admire everybody that's gonna be there.
[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:41.900]  This is something obviously that I'm not gonna probably be able to miss. I'm gonna probably
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:46.640]  need to come to this. I mean, it's just duty states that that's what has to be done to
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:54.340]  cover it. As a media person, my issue is that they undoubtedly don't have a choice. They're
[02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:56.260]  gonna try to spin this against you.
[02:17:56.260 --> 02:18:01.620]  People at first said I was wrong to blow up at Piers Morgan and say, look, 1776 will commence
[02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:07.040]  again. But within the days that came after it, people realized, no, it was a victory
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:11.860]  and that it was a defining moment in the defeat of the gun grabbers. Many analysts have said,
[02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:14.500]  I said this, because it called them out.
[02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:18.940]  Hey, you're illegitimate. You don't have a right to take our guns. You wanna enslave
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:23.800]  us. And if you try, it's gonna cause a civil war. That throwing down the gauntlet ended
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:30.260]  their creeping fascism. I'm just saying that if a couple thousand people show up and this
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:34.540]  actually happens, this is going to be historical.
[02:18:34.540 --> 02:18:37.260]  What else do you wanna add on this whole front to Adam Kokesh?
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:42.460]  Well, I wanna make it clear that we are doing everything possible to ensure that this event
[02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:47.140]  stays nonviolent. We are gonna be coordinating with law enforcement. And should they not
[02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:50.680]  give us a concrete answer as to what their actions are gonna be, and I have to be the
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:53.900]  first one to cross that bridge by myself, then that's what I'm gonna do.
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:57.580]  And I think enough people know from my past that I have the credibility to do what I'm
[02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:03.260]  gonna say as you attest. And I'm greatly appreciative of your endorsement in that, Mr. Jones. And
[02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:07.140]  I'm very much looking forward to seeing you there on Independence Day, not just as a reporter
[02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:10.580]  but as a participant, as I know you will be in one form or another.
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:14.100]  And also I'd like people to know that we are inviting everyone who would like to come who
[02:19:14.100 --> 02:19:18.420]  would not like to risk arrest, who would not like to be armed to join us as well. If there
[02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:22.140]  are any supporters who would like to come unarmed, you'll be welcome to fall in at the
[02:19:22.140 --> 02:19:26.780]  back of the formation should you choose. Although we might, it seems now, have far too many
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:30.500]  who are actually carrying and restrict the formation just to that.
[02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:35.460]  But this is gonna be an historic event. This is the showdown of 2013. We are gonna put
[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:39.540]  it on the line, and we're gonna see if Obama's gonna live up to his words or not. I can think
[02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:44.780]  of no better way than doing this. And it's just, there are those who are willing to cower
[02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:49.060]  who will say that there's no time for confrontation. And there are those of us who will say, no,
[02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:52.940]  I am going to stand up. I am going to assert my rights. I'm gonna make it absolutely clear
[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:57.260]  what I'm doing. But I will not cower in the darkness. I will not let government tell me
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:19:58.260]  what to do.
[02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:03.260]  And yes, we are going with the aim of overthrowing the government. It has become obsolete. It
[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:08.420]  is an anachronism in 2013 that we still believe as human beings that we should be organizing
[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:12.980]  society by coercion and violence and force of a central authority rather than as free,
[02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:17.100]  beautiful, independent human beings who are capable of getting along by persuasion rather
[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:18.320]  than coercion.
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:23.420]  And what we are doing is marking the high watermark of government on Independence Day
[02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:28.160]  2013. And this is it. This is the beginning of the end for government, for this idea that
[02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:33.800]  this is how society should be organized, that this monopoly on violence, that this destructive
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:37.700]  Leviathan has any right to exist among free, enlightened people.
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:41.700]  And in this day and age, when we have the tools, we have the information, we are able
[02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:46.780]  to see past the propaganda, to sit back and endorse this system, to cower, to say that
[02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:51.540]  the status quo is somehow acceptable, seems antithetical to every principle of liberty
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:52.900]  that I have ever stood for.
[02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:57.140]  Well, Adam, I've never seen you this focused or on fire. You definitely know you've crossed
[02:20:57.140 --> 02:21:04.860]  the Rubicon now. Historically, looking at this, this is the stuff that history is made
[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:09.380]  of, what you're doing right now. For me to get up here on air and declare that a second
[02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:14.100]  American Revolution was needed last year, a intellectual revolution at the state level
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:18.400]  that if the feds try to block it, then we have a right to defend ourselves.
[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:24.320]  This is the stuff of Lexington and Concord. We're beginning to enter the edge of that
[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:30.540]  zone, but I've got to ask you to quantify this specifically so the corporatist globalist
[02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:38.560]  press, the collaborator press, the occupation press, the sympathizer press does not take
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:41.140]  out of context what you're saying.
[02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:48.980]  I want you to quantify for everyone out there what you mean by this is an armed revolt and
[02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:54.940]  we mean to overthrow the government. Let me stop you. Do you mean overthrow the idea with
[02:21:54.940 --> 02:22:00.580]  civil disobedience and break the will of the corrupt establishment that they have a monopoly
[02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:02.540]  of force peacefully?
[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:07.100]  Because when you use the terms armed revolt, when you use the terms overthrow the government,
[02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:13.660]  I would say checkmate the illegitimate occupiers that outside of law are saying we don't have
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:17.980]  a second amendment when the Supreme Court's already ruled DC is in violation and people
[02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:19.300]  have a right to carry guns there.
[02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:24.580]  Is that what you're saying? Alex already it is checkmate for government. It is game over.
[02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:28.780]  We have put them in a lose lose situation. There's nothing they can do to rescue themselves
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:33.140]  from the situation when enough of their victims have realized that government is a racket.
[02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:37.180]  What I'm suggesting the revolution really consists of is the withdrawing of our material
[02:22:37.180 --> 02:22:42.100]  support for government. That is a tax revolt that is open resistance and rebellion when
[02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:44.740]  the government tries to force its will upon you.
[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:49.280]  That means that we stand up to unjust authority in whatever way that we see fit. When it comes
[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:54.820]  to violence, it is always an inferior solution to peaceful means of resisting. And we hope
[02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:59.260]  that we can accomplish this entire revolution peacefully, that we can evolve past this phase
[02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:02.500]  of human society where we thought that government was necessary.
[02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:06.620]  But should it be necessary, we have to make it clear and put government on notice that
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:10.940]  we will use physical force when necessary and when appropriate to defend ourselves.
[02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:15.740]  I'm very glad that we haven't come quite to that situation yet, but the government's reaction
[02:23:15.740 --> 02:23:21.000]  to what we do on Independence Day may prove that to be necessary. I hope they are not
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.660]  going to put us in that kind of situation where violent resistance is appropriate.
[02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:30.580]  I would rather have the officers that we will be facing decide that they are going to honor
[02:23:30.580 --> 02:23:34.580]  their oaths, that they are going to stand down, that they would rather be with the people
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:38.780]  than with the government. And as you said, it's already illegitimate. All we're doing
[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:41.220]  is proving that and demonstrating that.
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:45.140]  And when we are able to march through that city armed, we will show that the government
[02:23:45.140 --> 02:23:49.580]  fears the people, not the other way around, and liberty will be restored.
[02:23:49.580 --> 02:23:56.100]  We have breaking news at infowars.com. US Senator says Big Sis is buying up ammo to
[02:23:56.100 --> 02:24:02.700]  dry up supply in Hough. I believe it's intentional. Well, yes, they've now, our story that's been
[02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:08.740]  up on Drudge over the weekend is now confirming that they're going out to all the big men
[02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:14.180]  manufacturers and asking if they can buy millions of bullets within just a few weeks notice
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:15.980]  from them.
[02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:22.820]  And we have the video of Inhofe up there on the site, breaking all of that down. So I'll
[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:29.260]  just tell the crew to get that audio. So coming up in the next segment, we can point out what
[02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:34.480]  Senator Inhofe is covering and saying. Let me say this, Adam, and then let you make any
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:35.940]  other points you want to make.
[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:43.220]  I admire courage instinctively. I mean, who doesn't? And again, obviously, I've been asked,
[02:24:43.220 --> 02:24:48.380]  let's be conservative, 500 times or more in 18 years on air to have the armed march on
[02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:56.380]  Washington to go exercise our Second Amendment and to show them who's boss. We see the government
[02:24:56.380 --> 02:25:01.340]  buying billions of rounds of ammo, 7,000 plus anti-mine tanks. They're dug in, they know
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:07.380]  they're committing crimes. They know that their time is short.
[02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:11.820]  So I understand that they're in the wrong and literally an alien foreign private fellow
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:18.620]  reserve operation. But when we're starting to get such big in rows in the info war, I
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:25.060]  always say to people that want to get an armed war going, that I don't see that going well
[02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:27.820]  in the midterm or the short term.
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:33.380]  And I would like to try to have a velvet revolution as I think you would like. So what do you
[02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:37.300]  say on that front?
[02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:41.420]  Power seeds nothing without demand. And as Thomas Sowell said, it's amazing how much
[02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:47.020]  panic one honest man can spread among a multitude of hypocrites. I think that's what this is
[02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:50.780]  exposing. I think simply changing the conversation here, putting the government in a lose-lose
[02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:53.940]  situation is a huge victory for liberty.
[02:25:53.940 --> 02:25:57.900]  And we are going to do whatever it takes to ensure that this event is safe and peaceful,
[02:25:57.900 --> 02:26:00.900]  unless the government decides that it's not going to be. And if it turns out that all
[02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:04.940]  we end up with is a rally on the Virginia side of the river, we will have at least shown
[02:26:04.940 --> 02:26:09.360]  that free people are not welcome in the nation's capital and hopefully put the government on
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:12.820]  notice that there are increasing numbers of people who are realizing this, who are waking
[02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:17.460]  up, who are tuning into alternative media like yourself, like Adam versus the man, who
[02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:21.640]  are realizing that the government doesn't have their best interests at heart.
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:25.700]  And that alone is a huge victory. So I think anything that we can do in this fight, anything
[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:30.540]  that we can do to move humanity forward, to get the ball rolling, I think we are coming
[02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:35.380]  to an important turn, important historically, as you compared what we are seeing here with
[02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:40.940]  this event to the events of the American revolution. I'm quite flattered to think that there are
[02:26:40.940 --> 02:26:45.940]  people who are recognizing the significance of what we're doing, but even beyond the destiny
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:49.700]  of the United States of America, we are talking about our destiny as a species.
[02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:54.060]  And I can't imagine we are going to evolve to this point and then see that we are going
[02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:58.600]  to keep this government thing going and we are not going to get past this. So as part
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:03.540]  of that process, I'm just honored to be in a position where I get to do something about
[02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:07.720]  it. I'm really honored to have your support in this. And it is incredible to see the outpouring
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:11.460]  of support that we've had online for this. And it looks like we are going to have more
[02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:16.300]  than enough of the numbers that we want to have a critical mass to make this a success.
[02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:22.900]  Now Adam, expanding on that, I get historically you have the right to do this and I want to
[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:26.900]  punch up the Declaration of Independence for TV viewers, that it's our right, it's our
[02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:33.020]  duty. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object
[02:27:33.020 --> 02:27:38.840]  invinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, or under a design of despotism,
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:42.760]  it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:48.180]  for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such
[02:27:48.180 --> 02:27:56.440]  is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their forms and their former systems
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:57.980]  of government.
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:28:03.820]  And it just goes into the tyranny of the King of England. And we now are under banker rule
[02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:09.500]  where $85 billion a month is given to foreign banks and Warren Buffett. We are now under
[02:28:09.500 --> 02:28:17.140]  a kleptocracy of lawlessness. My only issue is that I think when I first heard about this
[02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:21.940]  about 45 minutes ago on air, I was like, Adam's a good guy, but I have a bad feeling. But
[02:28:21.940 --> 02:28:27.660]  I think it's the same bad feeling of the big bullies waiting for you at the end of school.
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:31.860]  But once the fight starts, you feel good going home that you stood up to him, even if you
[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:37.300]  got your nose bloodied, he got the same thing. I just don't want a physical war to start
[02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:42.540]  because I see us incrementally starting to win the hearts and minds. So I hope that this
[02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:46.800]  doesn't go bad or something doesn't happen, but that's the way it is.
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:53.720]  We need to trust in God, trust in Providence, trust in the universe, bending towards justice.
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:29:01.620]  What will you say to those that will say Adam is a provocateur, Adam is a fed, Adam is only
[02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:06.900]  doing this for publicity like a mercenary, because obviously that's already being said.
[02:29:06.900 --> 02:29:08.460]  What do you say to those people?
[02:29:08.460 --> 02:29:13.460]  I'm a provocateur for liberty. And Alex, I have to tell you, when I was getting on that
[02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:21.200]  airplane to go to Fallujah in 2004 with the Marines, I felt, I think, a similar sensation
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:27.600]  to what you're describing. And if it wasn't for the great false bravado and conviction
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:31.800]  that I was imbued with by the propaganda that led me to that point, I would not have even
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:33.620]  been in that position in the first place.
[02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:37.680]  Hold that thought. Recap that when we come back. We've got Adam versus the man dot com,
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:42.980]  Adam Kokesh on with us. I'm Alex Jones. This is obviously massive news that is breaking
[02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:50.300]  right now in detail here at Infowars.
[02:29:50.300 --> 02:30:00.980]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:01.020 --> 02:31:06.080]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:10.700]  good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact
[02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:14.980]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:31:14.980 --> 02:31:20.380]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[02:31:20.380 --> 02:31:25.700]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[02:31:25.700 --> 02:31:31.220]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[02:33:28.020 --> 02:33:32.420]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here. The news websites are
[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:41.020]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. The TV streaming site is prisonplanet.tv. Adam Kokesh
[02:33:41.020 --> 02:33:43.940]  is with us for the rest of this segment. I'm gonna let him go here in about 10 minutes.
[02:33:43.940 --> 02:33:49.780]  He's got to get ready for his own show in a couple hours. Adamversustheman.com is his
[02:33:49.780 --> 02:33:56.020]  website. And he, of course, has been a prominent libertarian activist in the last six, seven
[02:33:56.020 --> 02:34:02.100]  years on this run for Congress, amongst other things, and has also done a lot of media events
[02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:04.900]  that have drawn a lot of attention to tyranny.
[02:34:04.900 --> 02:34:12.700]  But I have to tell you that what he is setting out on now will probably have the establishment
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:17.020]  try to intimidate everybody and come down everybody, which will actually backfire against
[02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:22.140]  them. I had some of the crew, Adam, saying, are you guys gonna have ammo in your guns?
[02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:29.540]  Yes. So you're gonna be locked and loaded? Absolutely. We are asserting the right to
[02:34:29.540 --> 02:34:36.700]  be armed and to apply deadly force. And it's really one of the most overlooked points in
[02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:43.940]  all of the debates about gun control, which is that we are only alive as human beings
[02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:46.420]  because our fellow human beings want us to be alive.
[02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:51.820]  Human life is so very, very fragile and so easy to snuff out. The idea that somehow that's
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:58.660]  gonna be changed by a law or an edict from Washington is absurd. And to think that you've
[02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:02.100]  heard this point before, that, well, if you take away the guns, the people that really
[02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:05.940]  wanna kill other people will find another way. And it's absolutely true. But we are
[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:09.980]  asserting this particular right as laid out in the Constitution.
[02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:14.320]  And I think it's really sad to think that everybody goes, my gosh, they're gonna have
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:19.940]  guns at this event. Therefore, there's gonna be violence. Well, as we've seen from Kent
[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:24.980]  State, which gets raised fairly frequently in the conversation around this right now,
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:27.460]  it doesn't matter if you're armed or unarmed facing government.
[02:35:27.460 --> 02:35:31.620]  If they feel like shooting you, they are gonna shoot you. And we are gonna do what we always
[02:35:31.620 --> 02:35:36.540]  do and ensure that we are not giving them any excuse. But if anything, I feel safer
[02:35:36.540 --> 02:35:43.860]  being surrounded by fellow armed patriots and Americans who believe that there is value
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:47.960]  in fighting for at least the principles this country was founded on.
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:51.660]  And if only through our collective victimhood at the hands of the American government believe
[02:35:51.660 --> 02:35:55.500]  that there's something worth fighting for in this country than to be unarmed facing
[02:35:55.500 --> 02:36:02.100]  down the same police force. Well, look, this is civil rights at its core, just like black
[02:36:02.100 --> 02:36:06.320]  folks going in and sitting at lunch counters saying I'm not gonna get the food out the
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:07.320]  window anymore.
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:11.740]  I'm a human or going in the bathroom or sitting at the front of the bus. Back then that was
[02:36:11.740 --> 02:36:18.160]  incredibly radical. Those people were demonized, but later the truth was self evident. And
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:23.540]  the fact that it is the law you can be armed in a group in Virginia, they follow the Constitution.
[02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:28.760]  The fact that DC, what the hell are decisions a couple years old, they still are in violation
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:29.760]  of it.
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:36.300]  The fact that you are in the right, and imagine how backwards it is that government can be
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:42.300]  armed. But it's saying you can't be when the right of arrest is a citizen right where we
[02:36:42.300 --> 02:36:50.300]  then under state charter create cities. And then we decide to hire police to be our servants
[02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:57.780]  via the citizens right of arrest to be professional citizens to do it as our servants.
[02:36:57.780 --> 02:37:03.920]  That's why they're called servants. Now they're authorities, officials. And I saw a poll out
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:09.980]  where 86% of police are totally pro second amendment. And most cops I talked to at open
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:14.680]  carry rallies we've covered are love it because they get it. A real criminal is gonna have
[02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:15.680]  it hidden.
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:20.280]  They're not gonna see the bullet coming, they get it. So the problem is, as you know, DC
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:26.160]  police are even worse than New York police and I've been all over the country. They are
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:30.480]  so arrogant, they are so aggressive, they are so rude. I mean, you live there, you're
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:34.380]  around it all the time, that there is no telling what these monsters will do.
[02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:40.400]  And faced with real people, wow, I mean, I'm saying Katie bar the door, get ready to be
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:45.720]  called by every media outlet out there since Drudge picked up your story. And let's say
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:50.920]  you've got two minutes on CNN, not a big audience, but they're legends in their own mind. It'll
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:52.960]  then get picked up on all the other channels.
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:59.080]  Together the mainstream media is big. Let's say you are on two minutes or you're in the
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:05.760]  room with Piers Morgan tomorrow night. In fact, I bet they call you there. You're in
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:10.120]  the room with the slime bag Piers Morgan who only has 400,000 viewers now, it's dropped
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:14.720]  by about 200,000. He's a nobody, there's probably a 2 million listing right now.
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:19.360]  But still, by confronting him, it'll be put on Jay Leno everywhere else and then you will
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:24.360]  reach hundreds of millions when it airs everywhere worldwide. You've got two minutes with Piers
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:26.420]  Morgan, what do you say to him?
[02:38:26.420 --> 02:38:32.160]  If freedom scares you so much, why don't you move to North Korea? Is that enough? I think
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:37.560]  that's really sad to see that in this country there are people who would rather change it
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:42.660]  to go to some vision that they want to impose through government. It's really disgusting
[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:47.040]  that that's what this country has turned into, that our government has become not a mechanism
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:51.200]  of the will of the people if it ever was, but a tool of the elites to control the rest
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:57.080]  of us. And they get it by being able to convince us that we need government, that the government
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:59.480]  is still the will of the people, that we all have some say.
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:03.160]  And if you believe that and you wanna take the side of the government over the people,
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:06.540]  then by all means, please do. You'll be on the wrong side of the firing line when the
[02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:10.640]  shooting starts, but that's not what this event is all about. And when Piers Morgan
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:18.400]  wants to try to think that this is how he can kiss up to his new overlords now that
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:22.640]  he's on the other side of the pond, he's wrong because the power rests with the people.
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:27.340]  And Alex, just to what you said earlier about the law enforcement attitude, you're absolutely
[02:39:27.340 --> 02:39:32.040]  correct that they have found how to hire really some of the worst in the country when it comes
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:37.320]  to cities like New York and DC especially. But what we are gonna be doing is find out
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:41.580]  which ones are our oath keepers and oath breakers, and that's really important. But there's another
[02:39:41.580 --> 02:39:47.280]  wrinkle to this story in the law enforcement reaction on the side of supporting this event.
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:51.400]  And from what we've seen in the comments from those who claim to be law enforcement, opinions
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:55.960]  are a little split. There's some who are made nervous by this. We haven't had anyone say,
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:39:59.520]  I'm a law enforcement officer, you should not do this. And I wanna really point that
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:00.520]  out.
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:06.360]  I have not had a single law enforcement officer contact me as such and tell me that this should
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:10.280]  not happen. We've had a lot of support from law enforcement officers who are specially
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:16.120]  invited to attend armed however they see fit. And we have seen an incredible amount of support.
[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:19.720]  We've had law enforcement officers say that it's a great idea. We've had law enforcement
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:22.880]  officers say they'll be joining us with arms. And we've had law enforcement officers say
[02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:27.180]  they'll be joining us entirely disarmed. So they are welcome in doing this. And this just
[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:32.520]  goes to show that the people who are supposedly the servants of the people, but really we
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:38.200]  know the servants of the government, they are not just ready to fall in line.
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:43.080]  And this is really important for the peaceful revolution that we're working towards, Alex,
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:47.000]  is that we ensure the enforcement class of government knows what's really going on and
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:50.720]  knows what it means to stand with the people.
[02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:55.000]  Well my first knee jerk reaction was Adam Kokesh is a good guy, but I have a bad feeling
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:01.760]  about this. But you got cut off by the break, restart the story about Fallujah, cuz I wanna
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:05.040]  air that on my nightly news tonight, I think that's very powerful. Start over, cuz I was
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:06.040]  talking about-
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:07.040]  Sure.
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:11.200]  You know that feeling of the bully that's flunked three grades, weighs 80 pounds more
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:15.800]  than you and beats everybody up. He's waiting for you at the end of school. And I remember
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:19.680]  growing up and I could have gone out the back of the school, but over and over again something
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:22.800]  about it said I'm gonna go ahead and go out the front and I'm gonna find him.
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:27.240]  And then that bad feeling disappeared right when I stood up to him. So when I say bad
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:31.880]  feeling, I just hate giving the enemy the chance to spend things. But you know what,
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:36.620]  fortune favors the bold. And there is a tide in the affairs of men when taken at the flood
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:43.860]  leads on to fortune, Julius Caesar. Our fortune is liberty, and we're men too, just like them.
[02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:49.500]  And we don't seek power, we don't seek tyranny, and it freaks them out when we actually begin
[02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:55.480]  to reverse things. So man, I mean, my mind is all over the place on this, but my spirit
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:41:56.480]  likes it.
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:01.700]  But at the same time, my gut is concerned about it, but whatever happens, happens. Tell
[02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:03.700]  the Fallujah story.
[02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:09.520]  I'm glad you mentioned that, Alex. And I did share some of that feeling with you when the
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.380]  idea first leapt into my mind. And I asked my audience if they thought it was a good
[02:42:14.380 --> 02:42:19.440]  idea and I received an overwhelmingly positive response. But it's similar to that feeling
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:24.520]  when you're getting on an airplane going to Fallujah as I did in 2004 with the Marines.
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:29.520]  And despite all of the courage of my convictions imbued in me by the propaganda that led me
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:33.960]  to support the occupation of Iraq and what we were doing, what I was misled into thinking
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:40.820]  was cleaning up our mess somehow, which was actually participating in the deaths of a
[02:42:40.820 --> 02:42:45.800]  million and a half Iraqis as a result of the American invasion and occupation there.
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:52.160]  And with all of that, I still had some of this feeling. And it's interesting now in
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:59.480]  contrast doing this, not only do I feel much safer, but the courage of my convictions are
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:04.200]  so overwhelming compared to what I felt going into Fallujah, knowing that I'm doing the
[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:07.600]  right thing, knowing that the people who are standing with me in this are doing the right
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:08.600]  thing.
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:13.560]  All of those negative feelings are cast aside when you've done your research, when you've
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:17.320]  done your homework, when you understand the dynamics, you understand what's at stake.
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:21.760]  I'm not particularly brave. It may be bold what I am doing here, but I feel that I've
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:29.000]  made a calculated decision and I'm not particularly brave, Alex. I don't think that I have the
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:32.360]  intelligence, depending on how you would define the word, I simply have the intelligence to
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:35.640]  think things through and understand the calculated risks that I'm taking.
[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:39.080]  Well, plus, I mean, you don't want to just, I mean, this is my feeling. Tell me if you
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:44.120]  concur. I don't want to just sit here as a spectator while classic tyranny takes over
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:48.640]  and is arming to the teeth against me. And in all the federal training manuals, clear
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:54.280]  treason saying gun owners, returning veterans, libertarians, conservatives in the fetters
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:59.280]  that we're the new terrorist and army manuals or let's put it on screen.
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:05.560]  Let's talk about reeducation camps. They even use that term. I mean, really, the question
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:10.480]  is why have we waited this long? Yes, I have the answer. And that is exactly what I want
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:14.600]  to share with you in regards to your story about the bully. I know there are a lot of
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:18.040]  people listening to this right now who are thinking the same thing.
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:22.640]  Oh, my gosh, am I is this is this what I'm doing? I'm being I'm being turned loose by
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:27.800]  the authorities to the victim to be a victim of a bully that who's 80 pounds heavier than
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:34.040]  me. Am I going into a trap? And the answer is absolutely not. And you know this as well
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:40.280]  as anyone, Mr. Jones, that while the government may behave like a bully, it is a tiny speck
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:43.720]  of insignificance compared to the power of we the people.
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:48.440]  And if anything, we are the ones who are far favored to win this fight. If you want to
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:53.040]  take away in and see who has more power, those of us who are going to be marching on Independence
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:55.520]  Day or those who are going to be trying to stop us.
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:45:00.160]  Yeah, there was a big editorial came out. Guys, you type this in editorialist comes
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:07.880]  out and says, I saw it this morning, put NRA members in camps. And this is the type of
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:12.240]  garbage that we see going on. And I'm trying to find the article because I want to show
[02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:17.920]  people the image of the NRA as a giant ogre with a club and the government bowing down
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:20.400]  in fear, but that's actually true.
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:25.760]  We are a 2,000 pound ogre with huge spiked teeth and a huge club compared to a chicken
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:30.680]  neck nobody, except we're not an ogre. We are enlightened with liberty and freedom and
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:33.440]  decency and they should be scared.
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:40.520]  Well, Alex, after seeing the NRA's politicization, to put it kindly, I'm much more of a fan of
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:44.060]  gun owners of America, but you're absolutely correct. And if they did feel the need to
[02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:48.960]  put up a fence to keep all of us gun owners in, and it happened to take up the entire
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:52.560]  United States of America, except for the little part around DC.
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:55.720]  And they had a big fence erected around the district of criminals in order to keep the
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:45:58.920]  rest of us out. As long as they're keeping the government creeps and those who wish to
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:03.960]  control us in, I'd be more than happy with that.
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:14.200]  Well again, I am for open carry everywhere because a writing on exercise is lost. I just
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:17.960]  at a certain level need to tell people that there is a chance they could set something
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:23.460]  up, shut off a bomb, blame it on us, you name it. I think people should just consciously
[02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:30.840]  know the dangers, but the danger is much greater to just sit here on our butt and not get on
[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:31.840]  the offense.
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:36.640]  Thank you, thank you, absolutely. And that's the greatest thing, to be able to step back
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:40.920]  and put this in perspective. When the government wants you to think this is dangerous, this
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:47.120]  is a risk, what's the alternative? Sitting at home, letting them come to get you, letting
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:52.640]  the next Boston bombing occur, letting them continue to trample all over the rights and
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:58.160]  freedoms of the American people, that you think that's gonna be safer by comparison
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:46:59.520]  than standing up?
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:00.520]  Cuz history would say otherwise.
[02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:05.000]  Well, I wanna say this to all the listeners, and we've chronicled it. That was another
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:09.440]  major syndicated column just in one paper we just showed earlier. We'll put it back
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:15.880]  on screen saying put us in camps. And then I just showed on screen at army.mil the resettlement
[02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:20.920]  plan where it says our social security numbers, how to process this, how to take our photos,
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:22.520]  how to break the families up.
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:26.840]  It's hundreds of pages that we broke down where the military is training, that's why
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:31.280]  they're waking up, by the way, to put us in camps. How did the establishment think the
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:35.040]  military wouldn't turn against them? I ran into a lot of veterans this weekend when I
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:38.840]  was up in, or last week in Hot Springs, Arkansas.
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:45.440]  And they told me 30 to 40%, it's FM 3-39.40, internment resettlement camp operations. And
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:50.720]  it talks about reeducation camps, it uses that Soviet term. And they said, listen, when
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:56.920]  I was in two years ago, 35% were in. Or when my buddy was in last year, 45% were in. I
[02:47:56.920 --> 02:48:00.680]  ran into people in uniform, they said, everybody I know is awake.
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:03.080]  What are you seeing with all the veterans? I know there's a lot of veterans that work
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:09.600]  on your show, recent Iraq veterans. And then Homeland Security comes out and says, you're
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:15.480]  the terrorists now? Returning veterans cuz they know you're awake? I think they've overplayed
[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:16.480]  their hand.
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:21.840]  And then they're all over the news saying, we don't need to arrest Alex Jones, he's crazy.
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:27.040]  And so they cuddle up and believe their own propaganda and I think are showing their hand.
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:31.360]  We're not a bunch of poor Russian peasants that had already lived under slavery. And
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:34.960]  by the way, the communists could barely beat them, they fought hard. We're not a bunch
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:38.400]  of Germans that are just gonna follow orders, I'm not knocking Germans. I mean, I hope the
[02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:41.760]  New World Order gets, they've bit off more than they can chew here.
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:46.600]  Yes, yes, we are going to turn the tide. And as you've seen from the growth of the organization,
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:50.280]  Oath Keepers, and from the evidence that you present here, and from all of the feedback
[02:48:50.280 --> 02:48:55.640]  that I've got from members of the Adam versus the Man audience that are heavily leaning
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:02.720]  with, or at least we have more than our fair share of active duty military personnel, veterans,
[02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:04.020]  and of law enforcement officers.
[02:49:04.020 --> 02:49:07.100]  Because they're very concerned with these issues. And for the people that wake up from
[02:49:07.100 --> 02:49:10.920]  on the inside, it's very powerful to see that there's a whole other way of thinking on the
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:18.240]  outside. And I can only hope that in the greater picture, as I'm sure you're keen to see, that
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:22.800]  this will have some historical significance. It may serve as a turning point for those
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:29.200]  within the system, those enforcers of government, the members of the enforcement class, for
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:33.400]  them to see that there is an alternative, there is a means to disobedience.
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:38.420]  There is a calling to the higher law of the Constitution, if not the higher law of natural
[02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:43.760]  rights, to respect our fellow human beings, rather than to simply be obedient enforcers
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:50.000]  of the edicts of politicians. And if anything, I really truly hope that this event can serve
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:55.920]  as a catalyst for the revolution that is already occurring in the minds of so many enforcers.
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:00.820]  Well, let's be clear, they can crush stuff that they stage, and then claim they've defeated
[02:50:00.820 --> 02:50:04.720]  the patriot movement. That's all a hoax. They can get Bostonites to come out with their
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:09.400]  hands up because they ran a media hoax, but that's one time.
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:13.480]  Every time they get a chance, Boston, Katrina, they take the guns. The military, as you know,
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:19.620]  trains to take the guns. If 35, 40, 45% of active duty were awake years ago, the numbers
[02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:23.620]  I'm getting from Fort Hood, it's more like 60. What are you getting from the vets you
[02:50:23.620 --> 02:50:25.520]  know? I mean, how explosive is this?
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:29.240]  Well, I think in the veteran community, people are much more keen to wake up cuz they have
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:33.440]  a little less at stake. You get out of the military, it's a little easier to see past
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:37.720]  the propaganda that you're surrounded by. So I think it's very important right now for
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:41.600]  veterans to be reaching out to any active duty troops they may know. We especially invite
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:47.200]  active duty soldiers and veterans to join us on this march as well on Independence Day.
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:49.840]  And I really think that there's an important bridge being-
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:55.600]  Absolutely. No, no, no, this is the restoration of the republic against the Marxist globalist
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:51:01.400]  revolutionaries. Adam Kokesh, you got a lot of guts, and guts is enough.
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:06.860]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[02:51:06.860 --> 02:51:12.120]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[02:51:12.120 --> 02:51:16.400]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:21.600]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are, we all are.
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:26.320]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:31.360]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply.

[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:28.720]  laws. In fact, Belize is one of the last tax havens left in the world today. Belize also
[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:33.720]  has a very low cost of living, tropical climate, and is home to some of the best real estate

[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:13.080]  Yeah, the globalists are taking the gloves off, show our weed. Again, I think Adam's
[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:19.320]  a good guy. People need to know what they're getting into on this. It's your right to do
[02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:23.840]  this, but the globalists are criminals. And they're known to beat people up on video and
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:28.600]  then frame you for attacking them. And they've got juries so evil that a cop can shoot you
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:32.900]  in the head five times, hack you up with a hatchet, barbecue your flesh, and they'll
[02:54:32.900 --> 02:54:38.280]  call that an assault on them if he didn't like the flavor of your meat. And I'm not
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:41.340]  even hardly being satirical. How many times have you seen video of them beat somebody
[02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:44.560]  up and then charge you with resisting?
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:49.080]  I've seen cases where they say they hurt their fist punching you, so you hit me, bam, break
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:56.120]  your nose. Syria, how dare Syria say it's not nice, we're bombing them. They're actually
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:55:00.680]  saying that on the news right now, and the jihadis are joining forces, hacking America.
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:06.280]  Al Gore's got 200 million in the bank, on and on and on, while they rape us. The globalists
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:17.060]  are raping us. So I got a stew on this cuz I haven't personally done this because maybe
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:18.920]  the time wasn't right over the years.
[02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:23.940]  Plus, I saw a provocateur back in the mid 90s do this, a famous lady who put out hoaxes
[02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:30.800]  about FEMA camps and stuff. I don't think he's a bad guy, Adam Kokesh. Adam Kokesh I
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:36.480]  think is for real. And they can spin this a thousand different ways, but fortune favors
[02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:39.040]  the bold, and our fortune is liberty.
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:43.400]  Look at this Alexander Shultz in each end quote. I mean, people got mad at me yelling
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:50.240]  at Piers Morgan. I mean, Paul Revere was calling for killing Redcoats. So I guess just America
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:54.800]  is radical. I mean, how can you say, hey, I'm an American, I'm hardcore, but then not
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:56:01.080]  say, well, Kokesh, that's an American idea. Here's our guns, we have a right, it's pure
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:02.080]  civil rights.
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:06.640]  And sure, the enemy can do all sorts of stuff. And I know Lou Rockwell's got a long view.
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:12.120]  I agree with both guys because there's multifaceted to everything. We'll debate this more tomorrow
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:15.840]  and on the nightly news tonight. I'll be hosting it live 7 o'clock central. Alexander
[02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:22.160]  Shultz needs him. And how we burned in the camps later, thinking what would things have
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:27.680]  been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest.
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:31.280]  They arrested about half the city and sent him to camps. Stalingrad, or it was Leningrad
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:35.960]  at the time, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:41.440]  to his family every time a security operative crept down. Or if during periods of mass arrest,
[02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:44.720]  as the example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, it was like
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:46.240]  a half later.
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:51.920]  People had not simply sat there in their layers, palling with terror at every bang on the door
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:57.200]  step, the downstairs door, and at every step on the staircase. But it understood they had
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:57:02.560]  nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a
[02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:06.400]  dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand.
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:10.120]  They didn't even have guns cuz the Soviets had first taken over and took the guns and
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:14.960]  then decades later did all this. The organs would have very quickly have suffered a shortage
[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:21.200]  of officers in transport. And notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:27.920]  would have ground to a halt if we didn't love freedom enough and even more, we had no awareness
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:29.440]  of the real situation.
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:35.160]  We were purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterwards. Alexander Shultz
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:40.720]  and Ensign, because they killed, the numbers vary, about half the people they took to the
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:45.960]  camp. They raped people's wives in front of them, just the worst scum turned loose. And
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:50.460]  I'm telling you, in Obama's own weatherman documents that came out in court, I've played
[02:57:50.460 --> 02:57:56.160]  the clips. They dream of breaking our families up and hurting our kids and our wives.
[02:57:56.160 --> 02:58:01.300]  That's who they are. I mean, these people are hardcore authoritarians. Look at the torture,
[02:58:01.300 --> 02:58:05.400]  look at them funding Al-Qaeda to kill Christians in Libya and Syria. They are the worst of
[02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:12.080]  the worst of the worst. And we are boldly resisting them. And if you don't support Infowars.com

[02:59:01.240 --> 02:59:06.200]  that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most
[02:59:06.200 --> 02:59:11.640]  oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret
[02:59:11.640 --> 02:59:17.720]  network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity
[02:59:17.720 --> 02:59:22.700]  of government program has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles

[02:59:52.440 --> 03:00:05.920]  The Atlantic Coast direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.920 --> 03:00:12.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:25.480]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:39.440]  All right, we got a lot of new breaking news up at Infowars.com. Radio host to lead our
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:44.360]  march on DC July 4th to put government on notice. He said things like it's an armed
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:50.720]  revolt. He said things, I mean, he said a lot. We need to probably get the quotes out
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:57.440]  of that and add them to this article. He said, quote, this is an armed revolt. He said that
[03:00:57.440 --> 03:01:03.160]  this is a overthrow of the government. And he means politically by showing what they're
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:10.800]  doing, clearly using inflammatory language to get as much media attention as possible.
[03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:17.720]  But I don't know what to say. I mean, I support open carry, and I can only admire the courage.
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:23.120]  I've got some problems with it because I know what the enemy can do. But if you start letting
[03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:27.680]  what the enemy can do back to you, control everything, I've just found charging in usually
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:33.560]  gets things done. At the same time, it is fraught with issues. So I would just tell
[03:01:33.560 --> 03:01:39.800]  people, I would not bring your children to this, to say the least.
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:43.800]  And I'll think about it more on the show ends today than I'm doing the nightly news. I'll
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:49.240]  think about it more. And tonight, 7 o'clock hosting live, there's been some taped interviews
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:53.040]  they're doing too. But more and more we're doing Infowars Nightly News live, 7 o'clock
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:59.200]  central. But here's some of the news up at Infowars.com.
[03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:03.640]  I've got a special report we're gonna air. It's got the Dan Badandi interviews with people
[03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:12.240]  in Boston that were violated in the martial law lockdown that ties in with a MSNBC host
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:18.920]  saying that Ron Paul's a liar about it being martial law. It was martial law, by any stretch
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:23.160]  of the imagination, where everyone is a suspect, except government, who's the prime suspect.
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:27.240]  I mean, we're done. The government tortures kids in front of their parents in Iraq. We're
[03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:32.960]  done. It's an illegal government. It's criminals. Radio host to lead armed march on DC July
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:39.400]  4th to put government on notice. 60 Minutes propaganda counterinsurgency cops in Massachusetts.
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:47.000]  Yeah, they now have counterinsurgency cops on 60 Minutes calling the citizens the insurgency.
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:51.560]  And they're ready for it. They want it. I mean, this is a bad, bad government. US Senator
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:57.000]  Big Sis ammo buy to dry up supply. That's Senator Inhofe. Source, Israeli airstrike
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:02.440]  on Syria, coordinated with Al Qaeda militants. Unbelievable. This is like Twilight Zone.
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:08.280]  Internet sales tax, call Congress immediately. Megabanks, ATF, true culprits behind Mexican
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:16.920]  drug and gun violence. Obama urges grad students to reject warnings about government tyranny.
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:23.040]  And when that's all we see happening is massive tyranny. Alex Jones calls on World Press to
[03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:36.440]  cover Bilderberg 2013. I haven't even gotten to this yet. They're always blocking people
[03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:40.780]  getting into countries to cover Bilderberg, as Bilderberg is basically so powerful.
[03:03:40.780 --> 03:03:43.800]  And they tried to stop me getting into Canada, but the media knew I was coming, so it blew
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:51.640]  up in their face. So then they were forced to release me. And I actually wanna go. I'm
[03:03:51.640 --> 03:04:00.280]  buying the tickets. I'm coming. Why send crew when I can go myself? My wife's like, yeah,
[03:04:00.280 --> 03:04:01.280]  you gotta go.
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:05.720]  And I go, okay. Everybody else says I gotta go. But at the same time, I don't wanna get
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:10.720]  on a plane and get there and be turned back. Or I don't wanna get to the airport and ride
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:14.400]  up there to get on the plane. They say no, but they've done Michael Savage and others.
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:19.960]  But if they do that, it'll only expose Bilderberg even more. And may actually break the media
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:20.960]  blockade here.
[03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:27.500]  So very important article with a lot of key photos and some of the past Bilderberg info.
[03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:33.240]  That's up on infowars.com. So I hope that you will get that out to everybody and help
[03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:36.280]  us on that. And I hope to see everybody. People always want me to come and speak in England
[03:04:36.280 --> 03:04:42.440]  or speak in Europe. I'm afraid to set up a speaking engagement because they probably
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:47.000]  won't let me in. Because I'm so evil. I talk about the Declaration of Independence and
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:48.440]  you know in England that's bad.
[03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:53.360]  But the people there are hungry for liberty. It's pretty funny that a lot of my ancestors
[03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:58.660]  come from England and I may not be able to even get in the country. All right, but anybody
[03:04:58.660 --> 03:05:00.200]  else can get in there.
[03:05:00.200 --> 03:05:07.800]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the infowars.com team want to relay to you
[03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:12.880]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[03:05:12.880 --> 03:05:19.840]  front. Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats. But we can't do that without
[03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:25.840]  your help. By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at infowars.com, you will wake
[03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:32.600]  up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level. We need your
[03:05:32.600 --> 03:05:38.200]  help to spread the word like never before. They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic
[03:05:38.200 --> 03:05:45.480]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[03:05:45.480 --> 03:05:53.120]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here.
[03:05:53.120 --> 03:06:02.940]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984. We've lived in this neighborhood
[03:06:02.940 --> 03:06:08.280]  for years. We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts. They kicked in
[03:06:08.280 --> 03:06:12.480]  our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes. The police arrived
[03:06:12.480 --> 03:06:18.500]  in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry and my guns. I kept thinking,
[03:06:18.500 --> 03:06:23.880]  what if my family had been home? The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins
[03:06:23.880 --> 03:06:28.880]  are through a door and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders. The officer told me
[03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:34.440]  to go to easyarmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder. EasyArmor
[03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:39.920]  reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[03:06:39.920 --> 03:06:46.000]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:56.600]  Visit easyarmor.net. That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net or call 888-58-ARMER. That's 888-582-7667.
[03:06:56.600 --> 03:07:02.080]  EasyArmor.net. Ultimate door security made easy.
[03:07:02.080 --> 03:07:05.960]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't
[03:07:05.960 --> 03:07:10.640]  afford to pay your electric bill. That's closer than you think. You probably haven't heard
[03:07:10.640 --> 03:07:14.340]  about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the
[03:07:14.340 --> 03:07:20.480]  most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your
[03:07:20.480 --> 03:07:26.400]  already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months. As shocking as it sounds, it
[03:07:26.400 --> 03:07:31.160]  may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[03:07:31.160 --> 03:07:37.040]  But here's some good news. There's an underground video at Exposed123.com that thousands of
[03:07:37.040 --> 03:07:42.360]  smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly. The video
[03:07:42.360 --> 03:07:47.600]  at Exposed123.com has already been banned by Google. And the liberal media is doing
[03:07:47.600 --> 03:07:51.960]  everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now
[03:07:51.960 --> 03:07:58.240]  at Exposed123.com before it's too late. Again, that's Exposed123.com.
[03:07:58.240 --> 03:08:07.240]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:07.240 --> 03:08:13.720]  All right, I've decided I'm doing the whole hour live in transmission. Now I'm going to
[03:08:13.720 --> 03:08:19.720]  be live tonight, 7 o'clock, Infowars Nightly News, prisonplanet.tv for listing showtimes,
[03:08:19.720 --> 03:08:28.200]  streams and more. But here's Tim Clemente, the FBI counterterrorism official admitting,
[03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:32.600]  but like it's just, we listen to all the phone calls. Well, this has already been admitted,
[03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:35.320]  but it just shows how illegal all this is.
[03:08:35.320 --> 03:08:38.000]  This is an illegitimate government. Here it is on CNN.
[03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:41.360]  Okay, let's turn our attention now to the phone call between Katherine Russell and her
[03:08:41.360 --> 03:08:46.240]  husband Tamerlan Tsarnaev. You said something very interesting on Erin Burnett's show last
[03:08:46.240 --> 03:08:51.280]  night. You said that if Katherine Russell does not divulge the contents of this phone
[03:08:51.280 --> 03:08:57.280]  call, that the FBI had other methods finding out what was said. What did you mean by that?
[03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:01.940]  Well, on the national security side of the house, in the federal government, you know,
[03:09:01.940 --> 03:09:06.280]  we have assets. There's lots of assets at our disposal throughout the intelligence community
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:12.300]  and also not just domestically, but overseas. Those assets allow us to gain information
[03:09:12.300 --> 03:09:16.640]  and intelligence on things that we can't use ordinarily in a criminal investigation, but
[03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:20.560]  are used for major terrorism investigations or counterintelligence investigations.
[03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:25.080]  And you're not talking about a voicemail, right? What are you talking about exactly?
[03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:31.080]  I'm talking about all digital communications are, there's a way to look at digital communications
[03:09:31.080 --> 03:09:35.700]  in the past. And I can't go into detail of how that's done or what's done, but I can
[03:09:35.700 --> 03:09:39.960]  tell you that no digital communication is secure. And so these communications will be
[03:09:39.960 --> 03:09:43.040]  found out. The conversation will be known.
[03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:44.040]  It's all recorded.
[03:09:44.040 --> 03:09:46.280]  It's just a question of whether or not Katherine Russell decides to-
[03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:47.280]  That's enough.
[03:09:47.280 --> 03:09:48.280]  Own up to-
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:53.680]  Everything is recorded since the mid 1990s with your tax money. And the people listening
[03:09:53.680 --> 03:10:00.080]  like Cebel Edmondsons, she hears them commanding Al Qaeda, running white slave rings, running
[03:10:00.080 --> 03:10:04.040]  weapons, just like they run Al Qaeda now. I'm gonna explain to you, the people that
[03:10:04.040 --> 03:10:07.720]  run our government, that arrogant FBI guy all smiling.
[03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:13.480]  We have assets. Yeah, we know you got assets, pal. We know all about them. And now you have
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:17.920]  people without counsel say they did it while they're sedated and you cut their throat out.
[03:10:17.920 --> 03:10:24.880]  I mean, these guys are creepy, man. This is mafia that's broken this country's back. They
[03:10:24.880 --> 03:10:28.840]  get hundreds of billions every few years and no bid contracts to spy on us.
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:33.920]  And they all go along with it. They all think it's funny. They go, trust us. Yeah, right.
[03:10:33.920 --> 03:10:38.040]  You stolen the country blind. Now I'm gonna go to this next report. We're gonna go to
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:44.520]  break. We're gonna come back and take your calls at 800-259-9231. What do you think about
[03:10:44.520 --> 03:10:46.640]  Adam Kokesh in an armed march?
[03:10:46.640 --> 03:10:57.000]  Will you be joining him? Do you have concerns like I do? 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 specifically
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:00.880]  on the second American Revolution. Is it peaceful? What's gonna happen? What do you think of
[03:11:00.880 --> 03:11:07.280]  what Kokesh said? I respect his guts. I agree with his right to do it. But is it a good
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:08.280]  idea?
[03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:11.120]  Cuz I could have done this anytime I wanted to, obviously. You've heard the callers over
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:16.280]  the years and had a big national story. But I know I'm so real, they might bust a cap
[03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:21.160]  in my butt in the operation right there when I'm so effective beating them in the end fall
[03:11:21.160 --> 03:11:28.000]  war. I don't know, what do you think? 800-259-9231. That video so that Drudge can add it to whoever
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:32.560]  wants to for other news sites. I talked to him, by the way, it's his first video interview
[03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:34.780]  or audio interview that we just did last hour.
[03:11:34.780 --> 03:11:42.960]  That's going up at YouTube in the next hour. Infowars.com, we'll post it pronto. So underlay,
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:48.040]  underlay, underlay, a rebar, a rebar to Rob Dew right now is about to upload it. But first,
[03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:54.520]  let's go to this report that John Bowne and Dan Badandi put together showing MSNBC saying
[03:11:54.520 --> 03:11:57.280]  Ron Paul's wrong, there was no martial law.
[03:11:57.280 --> 03:12:08.920]  Everybody loved what happened in Boston. So here is that report.
[03:12:08.920 --> 03:12:13.620]  I'm David Knight with Infowars Nightly News. Now recently, Ron Paul was on the Alex Jones
[03:12:13.620 --> 03:12:17.740]  show and he expressed concern about the way the police conducted themselves. He had some
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:22.000]  pretty strong language. He called it martial law, and we agree.
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:26.680]  Governments are supposed to protect our liberties. Once they decide they're going to make us
[03:12:26.680 --> 03:12:32.080]  safe, economically and physically safe, they can only do this by taking away our liberties.
[03:12:32.080 --> 03:12:37.520]  Those pictures really concern me. That is such a visual image when you see thousands
[03:12:37.520 --> 03:12:42.440]  and thousands of troops and they weren't your local friendly policemen that were involved.
[03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:47.960]  I mean, can you imagine all these people being locked? They became prisoners. It was accepted
[03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:51.640]  too easily. It was a martial law.
[03:12:51.640 --> 03:12:57.480]  But Lawrence O'Donnell took exception of that. And he very strongly called Ron Paul a liar
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:02.480]  repeatedly on his show for what he said about the way the police conducted themselves going
[03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:07.840]  house to house, pointing guns at people in windows and houses, dragging them out of their
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:14.760]  houses at gunpoint, going down the streets and armored personnel carriers with full police
[03:13:14.760 --> 03:13:15.760]  riot gear.
[03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:19.480]  Wait, I want to show pictures first and then I want to show some of the pictures of the
[03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:25.440]  Boston police. OK, look at this. I mean, if this is what you have, why don't you invade
[03:13:25.440 --> 03:13:32.960]  a country? Show some of the other ones. I mean, go up to Canada, take their oil. Look
[03:13:32.960 --> 03:13:37.080]  at these. These are half tracks. I don't care what you might want to call it, an urban assault
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:44.280]  vehicle. But this country is becoming a police state and it is very troubling to me.
[03:13:44.280 --> 03:13:48.480]  We believe that's very excessive. We believe that that is setting a template for martial
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:52.880]  law to be gradually eased in. And so does Ron Paul. But Lawrence O'Donnell called him
[03:13:52.880 --> 03:13:57.980]  a liar. He said from the very beginning to say that this was forced is a lie, that the
[03:13:57.980 --> 03:14:03.760]  governor was just simply telling people to shelter in place. And it was a suggestion.
[03:14:03.760 --> 03:14:12.480]  Police don't need warrants, families thrown out of their homes at gunpoint to be searched
[03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:22.460]  without probable cause. No guns were pointed at any families. What a vile lie. There were
[03:14:22.460 --> 03:14:29.440]  no tanks and there were no police pointing their weapons at innocent citizens.
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:35.440]  Well, when the government points a gun at you and suggests that you do something, we
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:41.440]  call that force. And they may call it something else, but they're just playing with semantics.
[03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:45.520]  We wanted to add to the pictures that people have already seen, pictures that were already
[03:14:45.520 --> 03:14:50.920]  there when Lawrence O'Donnell called Ron Paul a liar. So we sent Dan Badandi to interview
[03:14:50.920 --> 03:14:57.000]  residents and tell us what they experienced during this excessive manhunt. And here are
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:02.260]  those interviews. A cop pointed his gun at me and then they called SWAT in and then SWAT
[03:15:02.260 --> 03:15:07.080]  came and picked me up by a shield and they threw me in the back of a car and then dropped
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:10.120]  me off in the middle of Newton. They dropped you off in the middle of nowhere. And what
[03:15:10.120 --> 03:15:16.880]  time of night was that? What time was that? Like five? Yeah. Broad daylight. Just dropped
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:20.720]  me off, took me out of the cuffs and told me to walk. And when they put the cuffs on
[03:15:20.720 --> 03:15:25.240]  you, did they read you your Miranda rights? So you were unlawfully detained from being
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:30.600]  on public property. Yeah. Did they ask to search your house? They told me they wouldn't
[03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:33.720]  have searched the house. So they didn't ask you, they just told you? They told me they
[03:15:33.720 --> 03:15:37.760]  weren't coming in to search. And did they command you to leave your home? They told
[03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:43.760]  us we had to leave, yes. One thing I was very, very upset about is that when we were leaving
[03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:50.440]  here, all the lights were on in the house, TVs, you know, and back door, they had gone
[03:15:50.440 --> 03:15:55.640]  the back door down my basement and they told me, I said, let me just close all my doors
[03:15:55.640 --> 03:15:59.680]  and lock up. And they said, no, they would do it. I came home. Back door was open. This
[03:15:59.680 --> 03:16:05.120]  is hours now later. Back door was open. Front door was open. Basement door was open. Lights
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:10.000]  were on, TVs were on. No one did anything. So they basically left your house unsecured
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:13.920]  with the doors wide open where nobody was home? Yes, they did. And you say there's bullet
[03:16:13.920 --> 03:16:23.840]  holes in your car? Yes, there's a bullet hole here. And there's a bullet hole here. It shot
[03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:33.000]  out the window on the side there. And in my car, there's a bullet hole. As you can see,
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:36.480]  I don't know where it is. Maybe some of the cars somewhere, I have no idea. But the back
[03:16:36.480 --> 03:16:40.800]  windows blown out and the side windows blown out. What they did, they just dropped it this
[03:16:40.800 --> 03:16:46.280]  entire world for a day. We initially got a report from the police department that it
[03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:52.640]  was voluntary searches. But then after talking to the residents, we found out that they weren't
[03:16:52.640 --> 03:16:57.080]  asking if they could have permission to enter homes. They were just forcefully entering
[03:16:57.080 --> 03:17:02.400]  people's homes to search. So did they knock at your door just walking? They knocked the
[03:17:02.400 --> 03:17:09.400]  door. But you know what I mean? The door, they almost pushed the door through them.
[03:17:09.400 --> 03:17:12.440]  Did they ask you to search a home at all? Or they just did it? They just did it. You
[03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:16.120]  know, they just came in and they're going through. And did they command you to leave
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:22.200]  your home? Yes. We left and they say, let's lock the doors. They say, no, no, we'll take
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:28.480]  care of it. We'll lock your doors and everything. We came home midnight and everything was open.
[03:17:28.480 --> 03:17:33.360]  And nobody was around here. So they left your house also unsecured and wide open. Exactly.
[03:17:33.360 --> 03:17:38.080]  And nobody was around here. What takes anybody? Anybody can walk in. They mistreated the elderly
[03:17:38.080 --> 03:17:43.080]  then, right? Yes. Yes. Yes. You know, I didn't like that. You know, like I said, they tried
[03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:48.440]  to do the job. You know what I mean? No. But at this point here, I got very upset, very
[03:17:48.440 --> 03:17:53.480]  upset. Did they ask to search a house or they just searched it? They wanted to search the
[03:17:53.480 --> 03:17:58.320]  house when my grandma said nobody was in there. And then they proceeded to ask my grandmother
[03:17:58.320 --> 03:18:03.560]  for my uncle lives upstairs and the house is a deadbolt. And my grandma said, you know,
[03:18:03.560 --> 03:18:06.160]  there's no one up there. I didn't hear anyone go up the stairs, but they still made her
[03:18:06.160 --> 03:18:09.900]  give the house key and unlocked it with that key and searched upstairs and all the way
[03:18:09.900 --> 03:18:14.400]  up to the attic. Well, they didn't want to give the key back, but they ended up giving
[03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:18.960]  the key back. My grandma, they did. And did they command you at all any time to leave
[03:18:18.960 --> 03:18:24.440]  your home or stay in the home? It was staying inside. The thing overall that caught my eye
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:29.880]  is that my friend on Franklin Street lived across the street and the army people did
[03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:35.840]  a huge search in their garage. But the boat was directly across the street. They didn't
[03:18:35.840 --> 03:18:40.280]  search the boat not once. They didn't even go around it. That's where the younger brother
[03:18:40.280 --> 03:18:43.760]  was found. That's where the suspect was. And it's funny because the police didn't find
[03:18:43.760 --> 03:18:47.680]  him when they did the thing. The person finally got to leave their house because they said
[03:18:47.680 --> 03:18:51.920]  everyone stay inside. He left his house and saw the blood on the boat. We, you know, had
[03:18:51.920 --> 03:18:55.400]  to go through multiple checkpoints and we researched ourselves. Other journalists on
[03:18:55.400 --> 03:19:00.720]  the scene were told to lay on the ground as they were searched. So it was a very, very
[03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:06.800]  touchy, very intense situation to be in. As a matter of fact, the one who woke up, a big
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:12.760]  shootout that was done from a Vietnam. It was a look like a Vietnam. So those guns that
[03:19:12.760 --> 03:19:18.000]  were going left and right. Yeah. All your neighbors houses got hit. Oh, we did. We got
[03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:25.200]  a stone door broke. I passed my stone door and the door. Oh, yeah. But I will get some
[03:19:25.200 --> 03:19:32.240]  more feet on this site. Yeah. Get me on my bedroom. Oh yeah. Nice when you sleep inside.
[03:19:32.240 --> 03:19:35.560]  What guns point at you anytime? And did they tell you to put your hands up in the air or
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:39.560]  anything? Not me, but my boyfriend. So your boyfriend had his hands up in the air and
[03:19:39.560 --> 03:19:43.640]  they were searching him? Yes. Cause he came out to check his diesel on the back of his
[03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:46.800]  truck. They were pretty much right here in front of my house and they were just shooting
[03:19:46.800 --> 03:19:51.640]  down that direction. Um, that went on for a couple of minutes and then there were, there
[03:19:51.640 --> 03:19:55.440]  were two more booms with the last one just really lightened the entire neighborhood up.
[03:19:55.440 --> 03:20:00.160]  Um, it shook the house, set off all the car alarms. And uh, did they make you put your
[03:20:00.160 --> 03:20:04.440]  hands up? Um, when we, when we came out, we put our hands up and they searched us. But
[03:20:04.440 --> 03:20:09.000]  other than that, we just walked out. And did they ask you at all to search you? Um, yeah,
[03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:16.320]  they asked, they just, well, they told us that they were going to be searching us. And
[03:20:16.320 --> 03:20:23.200]  by the way, the police know what they did is illegal. And so they're saying, Oh, everyone
[03:20:23.200 --> 03:20:24.240]  let us do this.
[03:20:24.240 --> 03:20:30.760]  And that's the type of emails and texts and things that I've been seeing people saying
[03:20:30.760 --> 03:20:39.820]  out there. In fact, here's one from YouTube today. Are you serious? They are looking for
[03:20:39.820 --> 03:20:43.840]  a terrorist. Like you guys can even give me a document cam shot of this. I'll show the
[03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:49.400]  viewers. Are you serious? They are looking for a terrorist. What and how should they
[03:20:49.400 --> 03:20:50.400]  handle this?
[03:20:50.400 --> 03:20:58.400]  Let's explain for the something billionth times to the billions of people. The importance
[03:20:58.400 --> 03:21:07.360]  people are not special. Get the F out of the way as professionals are trying to make things
[03:21:07.360 --> 03:21:17.680]  safe. You know, this guy's a cop. They may not be nice teddy bears doing booty, but they
[03:21:17.680 --> 03:21:24.760]  are doing it. And then you go to the guy's channel, he's into superhero movies and cop
[03:21:24.760 --> 03:21:25.880]  movies.
[03:21:25.880 --> 03:21:33.120]  And he talks about how epic the new Superman is. Here's his channel will cast or he's a
[03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:38.200]  contractor for government. I mean, I've seen this a million times. Man of Steel, emotionally
[03:21:38.200 --> 03:21:46.200]  epic. This is a child. Guaranteed he goes to Iron Man, watches him fight terrorists
[03:21:46.200 --> 03:21:48.360]  as they do every show.
[03:21:48.360 --> 03:21:53.440]  And really thinks that's real. That's a simulation for you, bud. The globalists have written
[03:21:53.440 --> 03:21:58.560]  books about it. They think you're stupid. Now, they've never done this in American policing
[03:21:58.560 --> 03:22:03.200]  or any other policing, locked down most of a city. And I saw him on the news going everyone
[03:22:03.200 --> 03:22:04.320]  could be a suspect.
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:08.480]  They could have people aiding them. And a blonde haired woman comes out of her house
[03:22:08.480 --> 03:22:14.040]  with her hands up. After she gets off the step, she puts her hands down. The cop goes
[03:22:14.040 --> 03:22:20.740]  and shoves her and goes, put them up. I mean, it is a bunch of nobodies on a power trip.
[03:22:20.740 --> 03:22:25.280]  Most police I know in cities would not act like that. I mean, it's like the cops in LA
[03:22:25.280 --> 03:22:31.760]  shooting up women in cars that weren't even the same car as Dorner.
[03:22:31.760 --> 03:22:35.840]  They're not out there facing real terrorists. The real thing they're facing is dangerous
[03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:42.760]  automobile wrecks and some criminals. And it's just this whole, we're soldiers, we're
[03:22:42.760 --> 03:22:48.000]  supermen, we're fighting this thing. And you notice in this guy's comment, and there's
[03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:51.700]  a lot of these, are you serious?
[03:22:51.700 --> 03:22:55.740]  They are looking for a terrorist. The guy's automatically a terrorist cuz USA Today said
[03:22:55.740 --> 03:23:01.720]  he is a terrorist this weekend. No judge, no juries, sedated, who knows if he's alive.
[03:23:01.720 --> 03:23:08.640]  And they're telling us, they could grab me and say I confessed. What and how should they
[03:23:08.640 --> 03:23:09.640]  handle this?
[03:23:09.640 --> 03:23:17.180]  Let me explain for the 947234728, I mean, it's like a billion times to the billions
[03:23:17.180 --> 03:23:23.160]  of people, the importance. People are not special. Get the F out of the way as professionals
[03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:30.000]  are trying to make things safe. See, we're not special, he is. This person probably is
[03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:34.160]  a janitor, nothing against being a janitor is very honest work, but a janitor at a police
[03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:35.160]  department.
[03:23:35.160 --> 03:23:40.680]  And like goes in and has coffee, he's part of the team. Did you are not special? Cover
[03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:50.880]  me is special. Cover me is authority. Cover me is official. USA, USA, got the 75 IQ.
[03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:54.680]  The Iron Man, he fights the terrorist.
[03:23:54.680 --> 03:24:00.040]  I was at Martin Springs yesterday laying there drying off after I swam a mile. And it's not
[03:24:00.040 --> 03:24:04.960]  even a lot, I'm trying to swim two miles next time I go, so out of shape. And I'm sitting
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:10.520]  there and I just listened to all the adult men around me going, yeah, he's got the thruster
[03:24:10.520 --> 03:24:14.400]  power. It's how he deals with it. And their kids are talking about Iron Man. It's like,
[03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:20.220]  yeah, I like how he dealt with that one terrorist. Yeah, yeah, of course, the terrorists.
[03:24:20.220 --> 03:24:24.000]  That is what men do. I mean, I've sat there watching the Avengers and the men will sit
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:28.440]  there in the theater before it's going on going, man, this means so much to me. I get
[03:24:28.440 --> 03:24:29.440]  to see this.
[03:24:29.440 --> 03:24:34.760]  So that's your manhood, a flying aircraft carrier? It ain't real. You and your family
[03:24:34.760 --> 03:24:43.360]  are being injected with soft kill, delayed kill, and binary bioweapons on record. Ecoscience,
[03:24:43.360 --> 03:24:48.360]  find out how science are, read it. Bioweapons are being injected into you. You wanna be
[03:24:48.360 --> 03:24:52.860]  a superhero? The New World Order's here right now. People are preparing for an armed march
[03:24:52.860 --> 03:24:53.860]  on DC.
[03:24:53.860 --> 03:25:01.360]  That they are the terrorists, that Washington DC is the good guys. Washington DC might as
[03:25:01.360 --> 03:25:07.480]  well be the floating fortress of doom or the black pyramid orbiting the earth that the
[03:25:07.480 --> 03:25:13.740]  stinking aliens are in for all that matters. I mean, it's worse cuz it's our own species
[03:25:13.740 --> 03:25:21.660]  and it's hard to get people, but the White House was attacked and Olympus has fallen.
[03:25:21.660 --> 03:25:27.780]  So that's why they can't have tours no more cuz the terrorists might try something.
[03:25:27.780 --> 03:25:35.340]  The criminals have committed so many crimes in government that now the sky's the limit.
[03:25:35.340 --> 03:25:40.840]  They intend to go all the way. I love this.
[03:25:40.840 --> 03:25:48.440]  People are not special. Get the F out of the way as professionals are trying to make things
[03:25:48.440 --> 03:25:58.200]  better. They may not be nice teddy bears doing that, but they are doing it.
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:26:10.560]  I mean, look at this. People are not special. Get the F out of the way. So your wife comes
[03:26:10.560 --> 03:26:17.200]  out, blonde head lady. The cop shoved her, just keep hands up, bitch. That good, you're
[03:26:17.200 --> 03:26:27.000]  not special. Respect me, respect me. When we talk to the people, you'd have a 17-year-old
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:29.140]  out in their yard look nothing like the guy.
[03:26:29.140 --> 03:26:36.240]  They pull you up, strip you down, drive you around, throw you out in another city. Get
[03:26:36.240 --> 03:26:44.300]  out of the car, we the government do not. Don't forget the video of the state police
[03:26:44.300 --> 03:26:51.440]  from their own squad car, 2001, Abby Martin, no, 2002. Maybe veteran, no criminal record.
[03:26:51.440 --> 03:26:54.680]  A checkpoint, they're searching cars. She goes, were you looking for somebody? No, it's
[03:26:54.680 --> 03:26:55.880]  a routine check.
[03:26:55.880 --> 03:26:59.000]  Hello, it's routine, so it's okay. It's like, we're gonna stick you in a blender. It's routine,
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:02.520]  so it's all right. She goes, well, you can't search my car. And they go, get out of the
[03:27:02.520 --> 03:27:07.560]  car, dude. I mean, their voice was actually like, all right, get out of the car, I'm handcuffing
[03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:08.560]  you.
[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:10.880]  And then they get in the back of the car and they find a pocket Constitution. And they
[03:27:10.880 --> 03:27:17.640]  start going, look at this, I've never seen nothing like it. It's like the most unintentional
[03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:23.440]  comedy in the world. It'd be like if they found a daisy in a field and went, it's so
[03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:24.440]  scary.
[03:27:24.440 --> 03:27:28.760]  What we gonna do? And they're going, I think we need to arrest her for this. I don't think
[03:27:28.760 --> 03:27:34.880]  this is legal. And the head one goes, I think it might be. That may be what she's talking
[03:27:34.880 --> 03:27:43.000]  about, having rights. I mean, it's literally, you know what? I'm gonna say this, Mike Judge
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:46.480]  sends me text saying, hey, good show today, good this and that.
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:52.100]  And then he's like, come on, soon as a couple weeks. Mike Judge, you need to come on, man.
[03:27:52.100 --> 03:27:57.240]  Because the idiocracy that you made is exactly where we're already at. Of course, I don't
[03:27:57.240 --> 03:28:01.360]  call him that often. I just gotta bug the hell out of him till he does it. Now, if I
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:04.880]  wanna go listen to Weldon Henson play music and drink beer with Mike Judge, I guess I
[03:28:04.880 --> 03:28:06.000]  can get that done.
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:11.480]  But see, Mike, I admire you, I wanna get you on air. I don't wanna go to a honky tonk and
[03:28:11.480 --> 03:28:14.360]  drink beer with Weldon Henson, even though I love his country music. Cuz then I gotta
[03:28:14.360 --> 03:28:19.320]  drive home. I'm joking, I went out and saw Weldon a couple weeks ago. It's always good
[03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:26.520]  to see his wife too, what a sweetie. Water is for toilets, drink Rondo, the first mutilator.
[03:28:26.520 --> 03:28:39.840]  And President Macho Camacho, the dominator annihilator monster truck. God help me, we're
[03:28:39.840 --> 03:28:45.200]  gonna go to Brighton, come back with your calls. I don't even know what to do anymore,
[03:28:45.200 --> 03:28:46.800]  I have entered the Twilight Zone.
[03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:51.400]  Cuz that's what I see like, you little people need to get out of the way and let the professionals
[03:28:51.400 --> 03:28:56.920]  handle it. The professionals never locked down 80% of a city and came up pointing guns
[03:28:56.920 --> 03:29:02.360]  at women and children. And then families are walking out there, pointing it right at them.
[03:29:02.360 --> 03:29:08.400]  And you see the cops eyes, they're all on power trips and look all crazy. Looks the
[03:29:08.400 --> 03:29:13.040]  cops going like, and it's like getting all into the pageantry and the media and they're
[03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:14.040]  movie stars.
[03:29:14.040 --> 03:29:20.400]  I mean, it's mentally ill narcissism. And they come up to AP reporters and say, we will
[03:29:20.400 --> 03:29:25.000]  kill you if you don't stop filming. Cuz folks, they were given the word, this will bring
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:29.920]  everybody down, these guys have got to die. Gotta kill the patsies. We shot him to that
[03:29:29.920 --> 03:29:31.880]  boat with all those machine guns and he's not dead.
[03:29:31.880 --> 03:29:36.240]  He's, my God, the media's on, we can't kill him. I was listening to the scanner. My gosh,
[03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:40.600]  the media's on it, abort, abort. And all of a sudden the guy gets up, it's all right,
[03:29:40.600 --> 03:29:46.480]  bring him into custody and cut his larynx out. He'll confess, he'll do what it takes
[03:29:46.480 --> 03:29:52.000]  to get rid of the vocal cords. That's how we deal with visits. We're on the march. The
[03:29:52.000 --> 03:29:57.000]  empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:34.960]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[03:32:34.960 --> 03:32:39.720]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry

[03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:50.280]  The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do. He tells me that he's coming,
[03:33:50.280 --> 03:33:53.040]  but the clouds are coming too. He ain't my friend. He ain't my friend. Well, that's not
[03:33:53.040 --> 03:33:57.880]  true. Bankers only love you. And we'll ride again. And I'll ride again. All right, I'm
[03:33:57.880 --> 03:34:02.880]  going to go write your phone calls or I never will. Some of the news up on info-wars.com
[03:34:02.880 --> 03:34:07.360]  that we need to get out is Alex Jones calls on World Press to cover Mulderberg 2013. Please
[03:34:07.360 --> 03:34:16.720]  get that out to everyone ASAP. We've got other big breaking news up at info-wars.com. And
[03:34:16.720 --> 03:34:19.440]  in the next 20 minutes or so, we're going to have the first six, seven minutes of the
[03:34:19.440 --> 03:34:27.680]  Adam Kokesh world-exclusive interview going up on info-wars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:34:27.680 --> 03:34:31.240]  And we'll send it on, not that I expect it to be posted, he already has a link to us
[03:34:31.240 --> 03:34:38.960]  today on the bullet story, but to the mighty, the mighty drudgereport.com. The bane of the
[03:34:38.960 --> 03:34:48.600]  establishment, the bane of the new world order, the high mountain fortress of drudgereport.com.
[03:34:48.600 --> 03:34:53.400]  US Senator Big Sis ammo, buying ammo to dry up supply. Hey, will somebody run me my cell
[03:34:53.400 --> 03:34:56.680]  phone in here? I know they had it out there putting apps on it for me, but somebody run
[03:34:56.680 --> 03:35:04.200]  that into me. Thanks. Right now. Let's go to Sean in Canada. You're on the air. Sean,
[03:35:04.200 --> 03:35:09.320]  welcome to the airwaves. Sure. Hi Alex. Nice to speak to you again. I just speak to you,
[03:35:09.320 --> 03:35:14.280]  my friend. I just wanted to call it's my second. I'm calling recent prison planet TV member.
[03:35:14.280 --> 03:35:18.600]  I've shared that membership and I woke up a friend of mine, an engineer who had never
[03:35:18.600 --> 03:35:23.480]  seen world traits nurse seven before and was floored when he saw the video. And so the
[03:35:23.480 --> 03:35:27.640]  message of Liberty is percolating and spreading through Canada. And I just want to let you
[03:35:27.640 --> 03:35:31.480]  know that you're doing a great job and I want to agree with what Adam Kokesh is doing. I
[03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:36.720]  think while you're right, it might be dangerous and we're dealing with criminals in Washington.
[03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:41.560]  These people can spin whatever they want out of whole cloth or they can piggyback on a
[03:35:41.560 --> 03:35:46.480]  real event. They, whatever they want to do, they're going to do it. And the time for action
[03:35:46.480 --> 03:35:51.560]  is now, if not a long time ago. So I agree with what he's doing. I wish him luck and
[03:35:51.560 --> 03:35:56.960]  I hope nothing bad happens, but, uh, I commend him for his gravy as you have. The other thing
[03:35:56.960 --> 03:36:01.440]  I want to say is that Ashley, Jessica, um, I'm a friend of hers. She, uh, she was so
[03:36:01.440 --> 03:36:05.480]  central to the opt out and stone campaign and she is trying to raise money to go to
[03:36:05.480 --> 03:36:10.960]  Bilderberg and, uh, and protest. And I just want to give a shout out to her and encourage
[03:36:10.960 --> 03:36:15.800]  all of her supporters on Twitter and out there in cyberspace to donate to the cause to help
[03:36:15.800 --> 03:36:20.920]  that girl go fight the good fight. Absolutely. And, and on top of that, everyone
[03:36:20.920 --> 03:36:26.440]  in England, especially we have a giant audience in Wales and in England and in Northern England
[03:36:26.440 --> 03:36:32.000]  and in Scotland and in Northern and Southern Ireland. Uh, and I just want to see everybody
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:38.080]  there at the Grove in Northeast London. It's, it's a suburb, uh, no, no North Northwest
[03:36:38.080 --> 03:36:43.600]  of London. Uh, and, and all the details are up on info wars.com. Everybody needs to be
[03:36:43.600 --> 03:36:47.120]  there, uh, because they may be able to stop me getting in. Who knows? They haven't done
[03:36:47.120 --> 03:36:52.020]  that yet, but they have, they're more authoritarian all the time. Uh, but we'll see what happens.
[03:36:52.020 --> 03:36:56.640]  We now have members of parliament in the EU and in the UK, uh, that are listeners of the
[03:36:56.640 --> 03:37:01.600]  show, uh, and that support us. So we'll, uh, we'll see what comes out of that. Thank you
[03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:05.920]  for the call, Sean, Frank in Louisiana gun March. What's your take on it?
[03:37:05.920 --> 03:37:12.080]  Yes. Uh, Alex, you know, it's great to mind great to many of the ages, Thomas Jefferson
[03:37:12.080 --> 03:37:17.640]  and the indomitable George Washington said that the second amendment Washington called
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:23.640]  Liberty's teeth and Thomas Jefferson said its main purpose was as a last resort against
[03:37:23.640 --> 03:37:30.040]  government tyranny. Now, uh, the Supreme court of us versus Cruikshank stated that the second
[03:37:30.040 --> 03:37:35.520]  amendment has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government. That's
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:40.120]  the Supreme court said that, and that's what we're doing here is we're trying to restrict
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:47.160]  this tyrannical government who has a literal president who called himself a dictator when
[03:37:47.160 --> 03:37:54.120]  he violated the war clause, the most dangerous clause that only constant, only that the Congress,
[03:37:54.120 --> 03:37:55.120]  that's right.
[03:37:55.120 --> 03:37:59.600]  He said three times in letters and in speeches and had the joint chiefs tell Congress that
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:04.720]  I can launch wars under UN authority. It's worse than the president becoming a dictator
[03:38:04.720 --> 03:38:08.880]  and saying, I choose to do this like Santa Ana, Mexico. That's, that's treason. But to
[03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:16.040]  say I am under a foreign powers direction is unprecedented. Frank, thanks for the call.
[03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:23.920]  Uh, let's, uh, talk to Greg in Utah listing on KYAH, uh, five 40 AM. Greg, you're on the
[03:38:23.920 --> 03:38:24.920]  air. Thanks for holding.
[03:38:24.920 --> 03:38:29.680]  Yeah. You know, I get a real sick feeling in my gut about this, Alex, and I'll tell
[03:38:29.680 --> 03:38:36.480]  you why, because these guys easily plant enough Patsy in their arms, Patsy ready to turn the
[03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:42.880]  whole thing south real quick. And, uh, because of that, I just get a real sick feeling because
[03:38:42.880 --> 03:38:45.960]  I know that they're, they, you know, this is something that they'll take advantage of.
[03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:50.920]  Yeah, no, I get the same feeling, but that's because of the danger. If we know what to
[03:38:50.920 --> 03:38:56.280]  watch for, if we know what to look for, even if they try it, we'll expose them. And again,
[03:38:56.280 --> 03:39:01.680]  Kokesh kept saying, I'm glad you agree with this. I'm glad you endorse this. That's not
[03:39:01.680 --> 03:39:07.780]  really what I said. I said, I'm warning people. This could be very dangerous. You have the
[03:39:07.780 --> 03:39:09.920]  constitutional right to do this.
[03:39:09.920 --> 03:39:15.640]  I admire your courage. I don't think he's an agent or a bad guy. I was laying all those
[03:39:15.640 --> 03:39:23.120]  provisos in heavy. Okay. There's a reason I haven't done this. My gut says you are having,
[03:39:23.120 --> 03:39:29.080]  I mean, people couldn't handle me getting in the red coat's face and going, Morgan,
[03:39:29.080 --> 03:39:33.480]  you want our guns? Shut up. You're going to cause a second American Revolution. Even mainline
[03:39:33.480 --> 03:39:36.760]  conservatives freaked out on that, they're so weak.
[03:39:36.760 --> 03:39:40.360]  But then I think, well, maybe the answer is get so radical, because that's not radical.
[03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:45.820]  That's America, to like move the Overton window towards liberty. We've moved so far to collectivism
[03:39:45.820 --> 03:39:53.440]  and weakness and patheticness. And look, everything is 2014. Because if we don't get more Tea
[03:39:53.440 --> 03:39:57.360]  Party real Republicans elected that are being demonized by the Republican and Democratic
[03:39:57.360 --> 03:40:00.960]  leadership who circle the wagons, they're going to get the Democrats and Republicans
[03:40:00.960 --> 03:40:07.860]  may throw it and give them trifecta, House, Senate, and the presidency.
[03:40:07.860 --> 03:40:10.640]  And if they get that in, ladies and gentlemen, there's different trifectas. You can also
[03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:15.400]  have the courts as well. But if they get that, look, they're always like, we need a unified
[03:40:15.400 --> 03:40:21.360]  thing. No, unified is what causes disasters. One of the things that's made America great
[03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:25.760]  is competing criminal factions. The founders knew what they were doing. That's why I watched
[03:40:25.760 --> 03:40:28.320]  Killing You Softly, I think is the name of the Brad Pitt movie.
[03:40:28.320 --> 03:40:32.840]  I watched that Friday night in a hotel room in Dallas coming back to Austin. And at the
[03:40:32.840 --> 03:40:37.720]  end of the movie, Brad Pitt says Thomas Jefferson was a piece of garbage. Thomas Jefferson was
[03:40:37.720 --> 03:40:43.560]  a filthy person who just wanted slaves. Thomas Jefferson tried to get slavery outlawed in
[03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:48.320]  the first constitution. They were in that age, there was slavery going on all over the
[03:40:48.320 --> 03:40:49.320]  world.
[03:40:49.320 --> 03:40:53.380]  Most whites that came to this country were indentured servants and sharecroppers, one
[03:40:53.380 --> 03:40:59.400]  step above the regular slaves, politically. In some cases, even worse off, and they go,
[03:40:59.400 --> 03:41:03.720]  he just wanted to have sex with his slave girls. Thomas Jefferson basically made the
[03:41:03.720 --> 03:41:07.860]  slaves his family, and then on his death, they were freed. And I'm not defending what
[03:41:07.860 --> 03:41:09.240]  Thomas Jefferson did.
[03:41:09.240 --> 03:41:17.080]  He grew up in that time. Thomas Jefferson then wrote the documents that were the idea
[03:41:17.080 --> 03:41:22.760]  that then fully realized led to more equality. And now they've taken equality and turned
[03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:27.040]  it back and made it a tyranny instead of a real equality. But I'm ranching. Anything
[03:41:27.040 --> 03:41:28.040]  else, Craig?
[03:41:28.040 --> 03:41:33.740]  Yeah, one piece of news I just read, and I'm going to forward to the article of a lawmaker
[03:41:33.740 --> 03:41:40.520]  saying that President Obama never qualified to be president because of his not being a
[03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:45.800]  natural born citizen status. He's confused this so-called first de facto president we've
[03:41:45.800 --> 03:41:51.520]  ever had. But I'm going to forward that article to you. I agree, I understand exactly what
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:58.560]  you said to him on your response. Yeah, you were very clear about that, so I'm glad you
[03:41:58.560 --> 03:41:59.560]  made those points.
[03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:04.600]  Yeah, no, I mean, I like Adam. He's a good guy. But after that segment, I said, okay,
[03:42:04.600 --> 03:42:08.240]  Bob, we'll talk to you soon. He goes, I like you, Alex. I don't agree with everything you
[03:42:08.240 --> 03:42:12.320]  stand for. And I was like, dude, I don't need a qualifier. I mean, I don't agree with everything
[03:42:12.320 --> 03:42:13.320]  you do. It's fine.
[03:42:13.320 --> 03:42:19.520]  I mean, it's like there's all these personalities in media. I don't care, okay? I care when
[03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:23.200]  they lie and say they're not buying bullets because they're a pack of criminals. The enemy
[03:42:23.200 --> 03:42:27.840]  is the globalist. The enemy is the private Federal Reserve. The enemy is Warren Buffett
[03:42:27.840 --> 03:42:31.580]  getting $150 billion or more, more like 300 billion.
[03:42:31.580 --> 03:42:37.760]  But if you go back, it's 44.5 billion in 2008, another 30 something billion the next year.
[03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:42.280]  Well, pull up, show people McClatchy, they say 150. That's like a two year old article.
[03:42:42.280 --> 03:42:47.400]  I mean, the numbers I've got are 300 billion of my tax money. And then he's making record
[03:42:47.400 --> 03:42:53.880]  profits ripping me off and my children's birthright. I mean, if you don't get upset about that,
[03:42:53.880 --> 03:42:54.880]  you're crazy.
[03:42:54.880 --> 03:43:02.040]  I'll be honest, I've had cars stolen twice. Now there it is, Warren Buffett on AIG, $150
[03:43:02.040 --> 03:43:07.520]  billion bailout. Haha, I told you so. He got 40 something billion just out of that. But
[03:43:07.520 --> 03:43:12.480]  the point is, is that I had my car stolen. I appreciate your call, Greg. I had my car
[03:43:12.480 --> 03:43:18.640]  stolen twice. Once in Dallas, another time in Austin, and the police both times wouldn't
[03:43:18.640 --> 03:43:21.520]  even come out.
[03:43:21.520 --> 03:43:28.000]  And I was like, okay, I got insurance, I'll get another one, but it was a big hassle.
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:35.840]  Imagine people that can't afford the full coverage. I had a lady I talked to who was
[03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:40.920]  at the baths we went and took in the hot springs. I got a little massage, had to have him on
[03:43:40.920 --> 03:43:45.560]  about five months, really helped to knot my back. And she had all her guns stolen, everything
[03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:52.120]  she'd been saving up since she got out of the Air Force 10 years before.
[03:43:52.120 --> 03:43:57.640]  And that's why stealing is really a big deal to people that don't have anything. That's
[03:43:57.640 --> 03:44:01.600]  why in the old days you could execute somebody for stealing a horse, cuz you took somebody's
[03:44:01.600 --> 03:44:08.320]  horse, they might die. And I really hate criminals that steal from poor people or lower middle
[03:44:08.320 --> 03:44:15.480]  class. Really, you steal some kid's bike when they're not gonna be able to get another one?
[03:44:15.480 --> 03:44:19.440]  And I think about the government stealing my kid's birthright. I get mad hearing about
[03:44:19.440 --> 03:44:23.880]  people having their kid's bike stolen. I've had my bike stolen out of my garage multiple
[03:44:23.880 --> 03:44:24.880]  times.
[03:44:24.880 --> 03:44:28.640]  Leave it open five minutes, taking groceries in or something, they steal your bikes. I
[03:44:28.640 --> 03:44:35.160]  don't care if it's in Westlake or South Austin, I've had it out in both places. And that makes
[03:44:35.160 --> 03:44:42.720]  me mad, the violation, the violation. But then I think about how they put GMO that they
[03:44:42.720 --> 03:44:45.640]  know kills the animals that eat it over time, organ failure.
[03:44:45.640 --> 03:44:48.880]  I mean, and then they brag and write books how they're doing it to us. And I have to
[03:44:48.880 --> 03:44:53.460]  look at them up there spying on us and getting my tax money to do it. And they're creepy
[03:44:53.460 --> 03:44:58.400]  and they're on power trips, man. And then I'm like, everybody's freaked out and scared
[03:44:58.400 --> 03:45:00.560]  of what Kokesh is doing.
[03:45:00.560 --> 03:45:09.280]  And my knee jerk reaction was that as well. And I'm gonna put warnings out. But I tell
[03:45:09.280 --> 03:45:16.480]  you, I feel like I should be there, because it is dangerous. This is the time to put everything
[03:45:16.480 --> 03:45:23.320]  on the line. This is the time to up the game. This is the time to commit. And he was like,
[03:45:23.320 --> 03:45:25.000]  I hope you'll be there being armed.
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:31.840]  Like, if you're not armed, Alex, you don't have courage. I don't think he meant it like
[03:45:31.840 --> 03:45:37.120]  that, like, hey, come on, go all the way. My issue is most of the time I'm not armed.
[03:45:37.120 --> 03:45:40.800]  People say, don't you have a concealed carry? I've never had time to go get it. I can carry
[03:45:40.800 --> 03:45:45.040]  guns if I want in Texas when sometimes I do carry a rifle in my car.
[03:45:45.040 --> 03:45:47.600]  Not most of the time because my kids are in there, they don't know not to touch it. It's
[03:45:47.600 --> 03:45:52.380]  just a lot of stuff goes on. I got a gun right here underneath the table. But when I go out
[03:45:52.380 --> 03:45:56.160]  to public rallies and things, I could have carried guns in Virginia, at Belderberg.
[03:45:56.160 --> 03:45:59.480]  And there were guys out there with holstered guns. Let me tell you, the police really got
[03:45:59.480 --> 03:46:07.000]  respect then. But it's almost not like I'm showing off that I'm not scared to be killed.
[03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:12.320]  I am not gonna live in that type of fear. I mean, I don't wanna die. I love life so
[03:46:12.320 --> 03:46:13.680]  much I'd never commit suicide.
[03:46:13.680 --> 03:46:17.420]  But if somebody does kill me, I hope they get me right between the eyes. I hope my whole
[03:46:17.420 --> 03:46:20.720]  brain gets blown out cuz I don't wanna be paralyzed or something. That's the kind of
[03:46:20.720 --> 03:46:25.680]  stuff I'm afraid of. I'm not afraid of dying. Man, this life is like five seconds long.
[03:46:25.680 --> 03:46:32.560]  I remember being three years old playing in the backyard. And looking up into the sky
[03:46:32.560 --> 03:46:42.760]  and the sun and just feeling the presence of God. And now I'm almost 40 years old. And
[03:46:42.760 --> 03:46:47.840]  I'm getting older and my shoulders hurt and everything else. I can't imagine what it's
[03:46:47.840 --> 03:46:52.320]  like, 80 years old, incredible pain. I mean, I just know I'm gonna be 80. It's gonna be
[03:46:52.320 --> 03:46:53.920]  like bam, I'm 80 and then bam, I'm dead.
[03:46:53.920 --> 03:46:58.880]  I mean, you know what? You don't have power over me. I'm not afraid anymore. It's not
[03:46:58.880 --> 03:47:03.360]  like I even wanna be there with a gun to say, look, I've got a gun. I wanna be there without
[03:47:03.360 --> 03:47:11.040]  a gun so that if somebody strikes me down, it's that even more obvious. And I wanna be
[03:47:11.040 --> 03:47:18.840]  able to document it as like an observer. Even wear a shirt saying observer, because that's
[03:47:18.840 --> 03:47:19.840]  the real weapon.
[03:47:19.840 --> 03:47:23.960]  Those video cameras I'm gonna have are the real weapons systems I would be streaming
[03:47:23.960 --> 03:47:28.700]  live, just like when we're at Bilderberg this year in England. Those are the weapons systems
[03:47:28.700 --> 03:47:34.180]  and Rockwell knows we're winning and he sees the danger in where this is going. So he's
[03:47:34.180 --> 03:47:45.080]  against it. Plus, he's a big anti-violence guy. That's all he talks about. He's real.
[03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:52.240]  But we'll see what happens because Kokesh is not doing that. He's doing it as a stunt
[03:47:52.240 --> 03:47:58.400]  for liberty, a provocateur of liberty as he called himself. But I mean, he'll do it. He'll
[03:47:58.400 --> 03:48:04.740]  do it. And I've always said it's not a good idea because they'll provocateur something,
[03:48:04.740 --> 03:48:07.840]  but see, that was a long time ago.
[03:48:07.840 --> 03:48:13.980]  So we'll see what happens. I personally don't wanna be around the TSA. It's not that they
[03:48:13.980 --> 03:48:18.400]  scare me, it's that it's so stupid. They know who I am, the government runs Al-Qaeda, and
[03:48:18.400 --> 03:48:21.600]  I'm scared to blow up and get arrested cuz I don't wanna be arrested cuz I don't like
[03:48:21.600 --> 03:48:25.240]  being around all the power tripping.
[03:48:25.240 --> 03:48:29.560]  The shallow people that just get off on exercising power for no reason over and over again. I'd
[03:48:29.560 --> 03:48:35.760]  like to exercise an oil paint brush to paint a masterpiece. I'd like to exercise open cave
[03:48:35.760 --> 03:48:40.880]  diving and spear a big old fish and go cooking on the side of the beach. I'd like to execute
[03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:44.920]  seeing a great sunset. I'd like to execute seeing your kids and my kids grow into a great
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:45.920]  future.
[03:48:45.920 --> 03:48:50.340]  Not sit there and just, I've got the power, I can make you do something. I mean, I'm so
[03:48:50.340 --> 03:48:56.020]  sick of it. All these nobodies who use the government as their power and then Obama's
[03:48:56.020 --> 03:49:00.480]  up there talking about how great it is. Makes me wanna throw up. William in Virginia, what's
[03:49:00.480 --> 03:49:02.200]  your take on all this?
[03:49:02.200 --> 03:49:05.440]  Hello, Mr. Jones. I remember I called-
[03:49:05.440 --> 03:49:08.480]  You're on a speakerphone and I need you to get off of it or I'm gonna have to let you
[03:49:08.480 --> 03:49:09.480]  go.
[03:49:09.480 --> 03:49:12.000]  I'm not on speakerphone, sir.
[03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:17.640]  I gotta move on. I gotta be able to hear people. I mean, it's totally echo-y and I can't hear
[03:49:17.640 --> 03:49:21.280]  you. Blake in Virginia, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:49:21.280 --> 03:49:22.280]  Alex.
[03:49:22.280 --> 03:49:23.280]  Yes, sir.
[03:49:23.280 --> 03:49:27.600]  This is your Pete. This is your PI videographer from Bilderberg last year.
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:32.720]  Yes, I remember you gave us great video, brother. What do you think of all this?
[03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:37.360]  I will be there with my five video cameras playing lifeguard to make sure that something
[03:49:37.360 --> 03:49:43.560]  bad happens. If you want to come, I will come to Austin and help Richard drive you up here.
[03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:47.840]  I'm gonna be stopping in Austin here the next month or so to see you anyway.
[03:49:47.840 --> 03:49:52.600]  Well, no, I'll fly up there. I mean, I'm gonna go to Bilderberg too. And again, we went either
[03:49:52.600 --> 03:49:57.400]  way. I hope I get in and cover it. But if England blocks me, then it's a new story and
[03:49:57.400 --> 03:50:01.560]  we win as well. I mean, it's like engaging is winning. Sitting back and doing nothing
[03:50:01.560 --> 03:50:04.440]  is losing. Go ahead.
[03:50:04.440 --> 03:50:10.520]  Absolutely. But I'm at the point now I'm just about top-eyed. I've had all I can stand and
[03:50:10.520 --> 03:50:20.440]  I can't stand no more. I see where Adam is going with this thing. I understand his take
[03:50:20.440 --> 03:50:25.920]  on it. But we need to have as many video cameras there as absolutely possible to cover every
[03:50:25.920 --> 03:50:29.560]  angle just to make sure that nothing bad happens.
[03:50:29.560 --> 03:50:35.400]  No, I agree. We should have we should have 10 video cameras for every gun. And believe
[03:50:35.400 --> 03:50:40.760]  me, that will intimidate the system a lot more than the guns.
[03:50:40.760 --> 03:50:44.960]  I travel both ways, sir. A video camera is my primary.
[03:50:44.960 --> 03:50:49.840]  No, I know. I know. I know. I've seen you. Anything else you want to add?
[03:50:49.840 --> 03:50:55.720]  Remember, I said, you know, the mantra of the infantry, shoot, move and communicate.
[03:50:55.720 --> 03:51:00.360]  We need to communicate so we don't have to move. So we never, ever have to shoot.
[03:51:00.360 --> 03:51:06.440]  Absolutely. God bless. When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is
[03:51:06.440 --> 03:51:14.080]  on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[03:51:14.080 --> 03:51:23.440]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride
[03:51:23.440 --> 03:51:32.720]  in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the
[03:51:32.720 --> 03:51:40.800]  crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gusset's got it other stone.

[03:51:59.500 --> 03:52:00.500]  Others don't.
[03:52:00.500 --> 03:52:05.800]  Hey there. My name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in
[03:52:05.800 --> 03:52:11.400]  a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold. Others think it's a gun. But the correct
[03:52:11.400 --> 03:52:18.140]  answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising
[03:52:18.140 --> 03:52:24.240]  item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have this one
[03:52:24.240 --> 03:52:28.800]  critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth is that
[03:52:28.800 --> 03:52:34.000]  you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:37.720]  your door. But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life
[03:52:37.720 --> 03:52:40.120]  and death for you and your family.
[03:52:40.120 --> 03:52:46.320]  Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[03:52:46.320 --> 03:52:50.720]  You'll be shocked. See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have
[03:52:50.720 --> 03:52:56.360]  already seen in the last three months. Go watch my video now at crisis123.com before
[03:52:56.360 --> 03:53:00.320]  they forced me to shut it down. Again, that's crisis123.com.
[03:53:00.320 --> 03:53:06.000]  Don't throw away leftovers. Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells,
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:10.180]  coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi. If you love to garden and compost
[03:53:10.180 --> 03:53:14.560]  but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi

[03:53:19.160 --> 03:53:24.020]  plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers. The EM Bokashi Food Waste
[03:53:24.020 --> 03:53:28.440]  Recycling System. Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break
[03:53:28.440 --> 03:53:32.920]  down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens
[03:53:32.920 --> 03:53:37.560]  with no turning and no obnoxious odors. To learn more and order your Bokashi online,

[03:54:00.200 --> 03:54:08.360]  All right, I'm going to wrap up the live transmission here in about six minutes, and then I'll be
[03:54:08.360 --> 03:54:12.680]  back tonight live, seven o'clock central. We're going to do a live info. We do that
[03:54:12.680 --> 03:54:18.520]  a lot of the time now. So that's always fun to do. So be sure and join us at seven o'clock
[03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:23.360]  tonight. If you haven't shared your prisonplanet.tv membership, your username, passcode, make
[03:54:23.360 --> 03:54:27.640]  sure it's unique to the site. You can also change it. You shouldn't have a passcode to
[03:54:27.640 --> 03:54:31.480]  the site. The passcode is something else. It's just a little tip. I'm not trying to
[03:54:31.480 --> 03:54:35.520]  lecture people, but then share your username passcode with people today. Get them to tune
[03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:36.520]  in today.
[03:54:36.520 --> 03:54:40.320]  This is how we're going to wake folks up. I'm not risking my life and going 110% here
[03:54:40.320 --> 03:54:46.780]  to play games. We can beat these people with the truth. And again, Adam Kokesh has every
[03:54:46.780 --> 03:54:52.560]  right to be doing what he's doing. It's committed. He's not going to back off now, so we need
[03:54:52.560 --> 03:54:57.240]  to make the best out of it. I have chosen not to do what he's doing. You've heard over
[03:54:57.240 --> 03:55:02.400]  the years. It's the perennial or the perpetual call every week. We need an armed march on
[03:55:02.400 --> 03:55:06.200]  Washington, armed march on Washington, an armed march on Washington, armed march on
[03:55:06.200 --> 03:55:07.200]  Washington.
[03:55:07.200 --> 03:55:12.640]  And that did bring down Ceausescu in Romania. And the military decided not to shoot on him.
[03:55:12.640 --> 03:55:17.560]  It's kind of like the V for Vendetta recreates that everybody marches past the troops. The
[03:55:17.560 --> 03:55:23.120]  difference is the globalists are smart. They're not gonna just let the troops mow people down.
[03:55:23.120 --> 03:55:29.640]  They would have one of their agents do it, shoot people like the Munich Beer Hall purge
[03:55:29.640 --> 03:55:31.600]  where Hitler tried to march on the government.
[03:55:31.600 --> 03:55:35.520]  Not like he was a good guy, but that's an old tactic. And they just shot the group up
[03:55:35.520 --> 03:55:45.260]  from within, claimed it was the group doing it and locked Hitler's butt up. But then British
[03:55:45.260 --> 03:55:50.480]  intelligence and others financed the Germans to let him out, making the leader. You didn't
[03:55:50.480 --> 03:55:55.360]  know that. You haven't read all the secret wartime reports that have been declassified.
[03:55:55.360 --> 03:56:00.960]  But yeah, they set Hitler up, set him in power, just like they set the Soviets up. Carol Quigley
[03:56:00.960 --> 03:56:05.280]  writes about that in Tragedy and Hope. Let's go to another call. Sebastian in Tennessee.
[03:56:05.280 --> 03:56:06.920]  What's your take on this, Sebastian?
[03:56:06.920 --> 03:56:12.440]  Hey, Alex, I was calling because yesterday I was in Memphis, Tennessee, and there was
[03:56:12.440 --> 03:56:17.640]  a big music festival here. And I wanna let you know the presence of the TSA. They also
[03:56:17.640 --> 03:56:23.160]  had explosive canine- I know, I said there'll be public bombings, and they're gonna roll
[03:56:23.160 --> 03:56:26.360]  TSA out everywhere, and let me grab it.
[03:56:26.360 --> 03:56:35.120]  Now I have USA Today, RR Stadium Safer, TSA and Army searching people now. Yes, this is
[03:56:35.120 --> 03:56:38.960]  how they take over. So now there's an attack on a grocery store. They're gonna have to
[03:56:38.960 --> 03:56:43.920]  search you there. But the borders are wide open, and the government runs Al-Qaeda, it's
[03:56:43.920 --> 03:56:47.720]  total crap. They're the terrorists, folks.
[03:56:47.720 --> 03:56:53.160]  You know, as I was going through there, they had squat people. And I went on to take pictures
[03:56:53.160 --> 03:56:58.680]  just to document it. But I, squat people walking there with their dogs, you know, looking for
[03:56:58.680 --> 03:57:03.920]  something. And it's just insane. I mean, it made no sense, you know.
[03:57:03.920 --> 03:57:07.520]  Well, you gotta remember three people died, so America has to get rid of all its freedom.
[03:57:07.520 --> 03:57:11.880]  That's what you do. Everybody's guilty except the government. The government was all over
[03:57:11.880 --> 03:57:17.040]  that bombing. And even if they weren't, I lose my rights now, and they're training us
[03:57:17.040 --> 03:57:19.640]  to be prisoners because of one event?
[03:57:19.640 --> 03:57:27.440]  Send us the photos, showtipsatinfoawars.com. And by the way, if you work in video editing,
[03:57:27.440 --> 03:57:36.900]  or as a journalist, or in camera, or as Internet sales, cuz I'm sick of just running ads locally.
[03:57:36.900 --> 03:57:41.820]  Jobsatinfoawars.com, that's the right email, right? Jobsatinfoawars.com, I meant to add
[03:57:41.820 --> 03:57:47.080]  that for everybody. Cuz I just wanna, I wanna just staff up now. I wanna go all in and just
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:51.640]  turbo charge, you know, as much as we can, cuz there's so many projects I wanna get done.
[03:57:51.640 --> 03:57:57.280]  I got like, probably like 100 projects partially finished, I never did. Probably more than
[03:57:57.280 --> 03:58:00.640]  100, I can't even remember. I'm thinking about this morning, I could list like 40 of them,
[03:58:00.640 --> 03:58:05.680]  I'm sitting there writing them down. It doesn't matter, I'll just work more to get out more.
[03:58:05.680 --> 03:58:10.520]  7 o'clock tonight, prisonplanet.tv, will you please work for liberty? This is not an exercise
[03:58:10.520 --> 03:58:15.760]  here, this is the real deal. Will you please spread the word about prisonplanet.tv? Will
[03:58:15.760 --> 03:58:20.480]  you please join us? Because if you'd like to know more, and if you'd like to know how
[03:58:20.480 --> 03:58:25.920]  to resist the globalist, then be sure and join us tonight at 7 o'clock, when we go live
[03:58:25.920 --> 03:58:32.720]  from Planet Klendathu, as we strike back against the New World Order and the bugs. That's Starship
[03:58:32.720 --> 03:58:36.520]  Trevor music, that's why I'm saying that. I actually said that to Denise Richards once,
[03:58:36.520 --> 03:58:41.520]  I said, I take you now live to Klendathu.
