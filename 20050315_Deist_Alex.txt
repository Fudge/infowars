[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.951]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:11.973]  Well, we attempt, and many times are successful, defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:00:11.973 --> 00:00:22.356]  But we've just seen a wild acceleration of government corruption, of corporate looting through the Congress, through the executive branch.
[00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.917]  Our freedoms are being scientifically dismembered.
[00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:28.562]  In front of our very eyes.
[00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:35.346]  And one of the few champions we have in the United States Congress is Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:37.968]  Doctor, family man, veteran.
[00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:40.369]  He's introduced bills to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:43.851]  Bills to get rid of the Patriot Act, which is totally unpatriotic.
[00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.393]  Has nothing to do with fighting terrorism.
[00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:47.794]  He has done so much
[00:00:49.082 --> 00:01:07.269]  And we, of course, have the Congressman on routinely, but I'm always honored to have Jeff Dyson, who works so hard with the Congressman and who contacted us this morning, along with many other media outlets, to tell us that, hey, you know that super Patriot Act-type national ID card?
[00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:07.849]  They passed
[00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.821]  standardization of driver's license back in December, which starts the National ID Card.
[00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:22.647]  But this new one, according to Ron Paul's writings and analysis of the bill, which I checked out for myself, creates a Pan-American Union ID Card with Mexico and Canada.
[00:01:22.647 --> 00:01:27.129]  Starts putting gun owners into these databases, as Larry Pratt has told you.
[00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.631]  It just does so much.
[00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:33.933]  It puts a microchip in the license so they can scan it and read it.
[00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:37.655]  So I guess thieves can scan you and steal your identity easier.
[00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:41.733]  It's horrible, but it has nothing to do with stopping illegal aliens.
[00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:43.935]  They put some trays in there like that.
[00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:49.280]  Meanwhile, Bush, after they fund thousands more Border Patrol, Bush blocks it.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.382]  But joining us is Jeff Dice.
[00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:53.304]  This bill is on the verge of passing.
[00:01:53.304 --> 00:01:54.525]  Jeff, thanks for coming on.
[00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:56.947]  Sure.
[00:01:56.947 --> 00:01:58.488]  You're the Press Secretary for Ron Paul.
[00:01:58.488 --> 00:02:01.170]  I know you've been busy out there today fighting all of this.
[00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.471]  Tell us
[00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:05.178]  What we're on the verge of?
[00:02:05.178 --> 00:02:10.283]  Well, in February, the House passed the National ID Card Bill.
[00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:11.464]  It wasn't presented that way.
[00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:19.372]  It was presented as immigration reform or amnesty reform or border reform, but it dealt with none of those things.
[00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.213]  It had nothing to do with immigration policy.
[00:02:21.213 --> 00:02:24.436]  It was just setting up driver's license standards.
[00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:27.860]  So the question then became, will the Senate pass the bill as well?
[00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:34.678]  Uh, what's happening today is Congress is busy passing a so-called supplemental spending bill.
[00:02:34.678 --> 00:02:39.362]  Uh, as though the, you know, the 13 normal appropriations bills weren't enough.
[00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:43.886]  And what they've done is they've, is they've inserted this, uh, H.R.
[00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:46.128]  418, the National ID Card Bill that already passed.
[00:02:46.128 --> 00:02:50.792]  They've inserted that in a very crafty fashion into this spending bill.
[00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:55.736]  And, uh, it's, it's, uh, going to be passed by the House and sent over to the Senate where
[00:02:56.341 --> 00:03:03.650]  Uh, the Senators will be voting on a much larger spending bill rather than voting up or down on the National ID bill itself.
[00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.613]  So, classic pork barrel?
[00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:12.100]  Sure, because people in the Senate like spending too, and they'd like to add things to it, but
[00:03:13.153 --> 00:03:26.286]  What it means is that it makes it a lot harder for any senators who might have not liked the idea of a national ID card to vote against it because it's now a tiny part of a much bigger spending bill.
[00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:28.568]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of things.
[00:03:28.568 --> 00:03:33.793]  They're busy trying to get the new bridge in or trying to not get the military base shut down.
[00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:36.856]  Meanwhile, now for those that just joined us,
[00:03:37.981 --> 00:03:45.366]  Congressman Ron Paul wrote a detailed analysis of the bill, and I went and got his analysis and wrote my own, and I had Larry Pratt on.
[00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:47.448]  I mean, it's got anti-gun stuff in it.
[00:03:47.448 --> 00:03:48.889]  It is gigantic!
[00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:57.035]  I mean, this thing has got regional government, the end of sovereignty, it's got just all sorts of horrible stuff in it.
[00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:04.559]  But then I tune into the Neocon Talk Show host, Jeff, and they're telling me how this is going to stop all the illegal aliens, and I've read the bill!
[00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.760]  There's nothing in there about illegal aliens!
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.202]  No, they, you know, they don't have passports now.
[00:04:10.202 --> 00:04:14.285]  You know, by definition, an illegal alien is the lawbreaker.
[00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:20.028]  So why, if they're not concerned with our immigration laws, I'm not sure I understand why they should be concerned with our ID laws.
[00:04:23.655 --> 00:04:29.459]  For those that don't know the details of the bill, can you go over a little bit of what's in this expansion of the National ID Card?
[00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:38.345]  Well, the ID Card Bill, first and foremost, it forces all the states to have certain characteristics on their driver's license.
[00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:40.446]  And it forces them all into this federal regime.
[00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:48.952]  It also allows the Homeland Security Department head to, in the future, determine, you know, without going to Congress,
[00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:52.027]  Determine what standards need to be on there.
[00:04:52.027 --> 00:04:53.148]  That could be biometrics.
[00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:54.188]  It could be a fingerprint.
[00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:55.769]  It could be all kinds of things.
[00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:56.970]  RFID.
[00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.591]  You name it.
[00:04:57.591 --> 00:05:03.875]  It's very open-ended, and it allows future Homeland Security chiefs to do that without a congressional vote.
[00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:13.782]  But it also forces all the states to link to what's called the Driver's License Agreement, which is something that the motor vehicle folks have wanted for a long time.
[00:05:13.782 --> 00:05:16.704]  And it's in that Driver's License Agreement, the DLA, where
[00:05:19.395 --> 00:05:29.161]  Canada and Mexico could be linked to our driver's license database so it becomes sort of a tri-national database.
[00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:31.843]  So that's essentially what the National ID Card does.
[00:05:31.843 --> 00:05:36.386]  It takes the first steps towards a domestic passport.
[00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:39.948]  For the time being, it's still going to be a driver's license.
[00:05:39.948 --> 00:05:41.629]  It's still going to have the name of your state on it.
[00:05:42.253 --> 00:05:45.116]  But in essence, it's going to be a federal idea.
[00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:47.318]  And really, we think it's just softening people up.
[00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:54.965]  Well, it's just like they have 50 different quarters they issue, and each quarter has a symbol of the state on the back now, but it's all federal.
[00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:56.446]  It all came from the same mint.
[00:05:56.446 --> 00:05:58.648]  Sure, sure.
[00:05:58.648 --> 00:06:04.834]  They know that maybe people aren't emotionally ready to just be handed federal papers, so they're
[00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:09.937]  They're going to ease us into it, and of course incrementalism is the way Washington operates.
[00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:19.803]  But it's even worse than just federal papers, because no longer will it be state and federal separate papers, it will all be integrated under one system, even getting a lot of control over the state systems.
[00:06:19.803 --> 00:06:20.944]  Right, absolutely.
[00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:21.904]  Even worse!
[00:06:21.904 --> 00:06:27.307]  Both parties have totally sold out on the concept of federalism, you know, shared power between federal and state government.
[00:06:28.728 --> 00:06:30.450]  Both parties sold out on that a long time ago.
[00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:42.901]  So now, if you're in bad with the state, you're in bad with the feds, and if you're in bad with the feds, you're in bad with the state, and now the states are all doing agreements with other states to follow all their laws and take your license for this or that.
[00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:44.742]  I mean, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
[00:06:44.742 --> 00:06:46.884]  The vision of the Founding Fathers torched.
[00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:49.987]  Now, WorldNetDaily picked it up, and then the AP did as well.
[00:06:51.371 --> 00:07:00.504]  And I read the passage, I should have brought that for this interview, but when they saw this new bill that's about to pass today, must we somehow stop it and put a lot of pressure on Congress?
[00:07:00.504 --> 00:07:02.467]  We'll get that number out here in a few minutes.
[00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:06.853]  But Jeff, it was this passage about the security fence on the Mexico border with
[00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:19.763]  California, but then it leaves it open-ended, where it says the Feds can basically, in any of these areas, just not follow existing laws and make laws they wish.
[00:07:19.763 --> 00:07:23.747]  Well, this Homeland Security Office wants more illegal aliens.
[00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:25.648]  They've said, no, we're not going to spend money.
[00:07:25.648 --> 00:07:27.490]  Congress gives us for more Border Patrol.
[00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.492]  So, very dangerous precedent.
[00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.213]  Any comments on that?
[00:07:31.733 --> 00:07:37.841]  Yeah, it had a provision, an express provision that allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to suspend domestic laws.
[00:07:40.488 --> 00:07:44.370]  In this case, in order to finish this border fence that they're talking about.
[00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.550]  But it's open-ended, though.
[00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.491]  Yeah, it's open-ended.
[00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:50.893]  You know, the suspension of law, God knows what that could be in five or ten years.
[00:07:50.893 --> 00:07:57.036]  They could decide to suspend all kinds of laws, like habeas corpus or something, if we had another terrorist event or something like that.
[00:07:57.036 --> 00:08:01.758]  But look, there's no will to build a border fence, or it would have been done a long time ago.
[00:08:01.758 --> 00:08:03.319]  That's a red herring.
[00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:07.701]  Yeah, they put that name on there, and the lawyers all look at it and go, wait, this is for everything!
[00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:08.622]  Right.
[00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:09.183]  Exactly.
[00:08:09.183 --> 00:08:09.604]  Exactly.
[00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:11.407]  They like tag it with the name Border.
[00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:12.990]  It has nothing to do with it.
[00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.470]  Right.
[00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.713]  It was pretty eye-opening.
[00:08:14.713 --> 00:08:20.022]  I mean, there were even some Democrats who objected to it, who said, wow, this is pretty open-ended.
[00:08:20.022 --> 00:08:21.785]  We're letting the... Well, what securities are...
[00:08:22.594 --> 00:08:23.254]  I think so.
[00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:51.885]  And he said, you're going to have to have one of these cards to have a job, we're going to list citizens, you know, green, yellow, orange, red, bad credit.
[00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:57.568]  He was admitting it all, and it was food service, transportation, everything!
[00:08:57.568 --> 00:09:09.133]  Every job we're going to have, and the feds with all these databases that are full of false reports, and you know, five members of congress can't fly, and I mean, all this is happening.
[00:09:09.133 --> 00:09:10.033]  This is insane!
[00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:14.327]  Well, it's more of the same.
[00:09:14.327 --> 00:09:18.291]  It's where we've been headed for a long time.
[00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.592]  Virtually everything you do now has a federal component.
[00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:24.916]  If you want to fly on an airplane, that's FAA.
[00:09:24.916 --> 00:09:32.242]  If you want to get a job, you have to show your status as a legal citizen or a resident.
[00:09:32.242 --> 00:09:38.907]  If you want to enter a federal building, it's no longer a case where a person can live their life
[00:09:39.825 --> 00:09:46.474]  Uh, you know, without having to deal with the federal government, which is why no state is going to refuse this agreement.
[00:09:46.474 --> 00:09:52.763]  Because, as our colleague pointed out, they're going to make non-citizens essentially out of their citizens if they don't accept the ID.
[00:09:54.716 --> 00:10:03.179]  Gotta have it to live, to have a job, and have you seen this where you go into a gas station and the old lady has to show her ID and they scan it to buy beer?
[00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:04.719]  Or somebody buying cigarettes?
[00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:14.202]  And all these corporations are suddenly... I talked to a guy who runs a Diamond Shamrock, he said, yeah, they told us that soon we're going to swipe the card for everything.
[00:10:14.202 --> 00:10:16.703]  And of course that has to do with the national sales tax.
[00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:17.343]  Right.
[00:10:17.343 --> 00:10:19.804]  I mean, this is a nightmare!
[00:10:19.804 --> 00:10:22.325]  And again, Rush Limbaugh, Jeff, will not talk about this.
[00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.030]  Right.
[00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:31.914]  Well, you know, Republicans love the state as much as Democrats do, that's for sure.
[00:10:31.914 --> 00:10:33.315]  Wow.
[00:10:33.315 --> 00:10:34.756]  But what happened in Congress?
[00:10:34.756 --> 00:10:36.577]  I mean, they know this is all unpopular.
[00:10:36.577 --> 00:10:41.239]  They know people are against this 70-80% major polls, all this stuff.
[00:10:41.239 --> 00:10:42.760]  ID cards is even higher.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.041]  But they just keep doing it.
[00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:47.262]  Well, in the past, the Congress wasn't this out of control.
[00:10:47.262 --> 00:10:48.363]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:10:48.903 --> 00:11:03.796]  Well, I think what happened in Congress is most people don't carefully read bills, and the sponsor of the bill and the House leadership presented it as an immigration reform bill, and it's a party thing, so all the Republicans in the Republican House quickly fall into line.
[00:11:04.515 --> 00:11:09.981]  Uh, the Democrats are, as you know, Hillary and others, trying to look a little bit more tough on immigration.
[00:11:09.981 --> 00:11:10.782]  I love it!
[00:11:10.782 --> 00:11:19.811]  So most of them fell in line, and the few that did object, didn't object on the grounds that a national idea is Orwellian, or a national idea is not proper in a supposedly free society.
[00:11:20.793 --> 00:11:24.915]  Their objections were that their constituencies are illegal immigrants.
[00:11:24.915 --> 00:11:29.758]  Which then plays into conservatives thinking it's real.
[00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:31.719]  Really, that's like WWF wrestling.
[00:11:31.719 --> 00:11:33.320]  It's a staged event.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:40.143]  Because the last national ID card bill that passed, it was in there, where it actually tells the states to issue IDs to illegals.
[00:11:40.143 --> 00:11:41.084]  Form of amnesty.
[00:11:41.084 --> 00:11:45.026]  I'll do one more segment with us, Jeff, because I want to ask you a few other important questions.
[00:11:45.026 --> 00:11:46.866]  We'll be back in about three and a half minutes.
[00:11:46.866 --> 00:11:47.667]  Four minutes, folks.
[00:11:48.491 --> 00:11:56.837]  I'm Alex Jones and we're talking to Jeff Deist from Ron Paul's office.
[00:11:56.837 --> 00:12:01.140]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.121]  The real money folks.
[00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:07.855]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:12:07.855 --> 00:12:08.776]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:12:08.776 --> 00:12:09.417]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:09.837]  A 5% increase.
[00:12:09.837 --> 00:12:12.800]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.062]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:12:26.696 --> 00:12:29.078]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:12:29.078 --> 00:12:32.941]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:12:32.941 --> 00:12:36.524]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:12:57.376 --> 00:13:00.557]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:13:00.557 --> 00:13:08.378]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:13:08.378 --> 00:13:11.459]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:18.600]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:26.682]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:13:27.728 --> 00:13:36.434]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:13:56.917 --> 00:13:58.678]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:13:58.678 --> 00:14:02.920]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.881]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:14:05.881 --> 00:14:12.764]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:14:12.764 --> 00:14:15.985]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:18.506]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:14:18.506 --> 00:14:23.228]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:14:23.408 --> 00:14:38.137]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[00:14:38.137 --> 00:14:44.840]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-888-9000.

[00:14:48.202 --> 00:14:50.483]  That's triple 8.
[00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:50.863]  8-0-3-4-4-3-8.
[00:14:50.863 --> 00:14:56.566]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:14:56.566 --> 00:15:00.547]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[00:15:00.547 --> 00:15:01.768]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:07.030]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.451]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:12.432]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[00:15:12.432 --> 00:15:12.972]  Cardivite.
[00:15:12.972 --> 00:15:13.512]  Cardivite.
[00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:15.053]  We all use Cardivite!
[00:15:15.908 --> 00:15:19.853]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Carnivite.

[00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.389]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[00:16:02.731 --> 00:16:05.393]  Look at your children.
[00:16:05.393 --> 00:16:07.715]  You're committing them to a nightmare system.
[00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:09.997]  I mean, the police state is all around us.
[00:16:09.997 --> 00:16:11.559]  We're talking to Jeff Dice.
[00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:14.081]  He's the head honcho over there for Ron Paul.
[00:16:14.081 --> 00:16:16.303]  Has a fabulous job.
[00:16:16.303 --> 00:16:27.412]  And, uh, well, warning you that, uh, this massive expansion of the already passed National ID Card of last year is on the verge of passing the Senate today or tomorrow.
[00:16:27.412 --> 00:16:28.273]  It's the supplemental
[00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:33.056]  Bill, as it's known, Supplemental Budget, or Pork Barrel.
[00:16:33.056 --> 00:16:35.779]  Give them a call at Congress, ask for your Senator.
[00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:38.182]  Forget House members, it's in the Senate.
[00:16:38.182 --> 00:16:39.945]  Or, should we call both, Jeff?
[00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:45.932]  Absolutely, because the House is still voting today on the supplemental and the Senate will in the very near future.
[00:16:45.932 --> 00:16:47.773]  Pull the foot out of my mouth then.
[00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:48.993]  Call both House and Senate.
[00:16:48.993 --> 00:16:49.314]  202-224-3121.
[00:16:49.314 --> 00:16:49.694]  202-224-3121.
[00:16:49.694 --> 00:16:51.195]  And we do stop stuff sometimes.
[00:16:51.195 --> 00:16:52.215]  Sometimes we don't, but tell them.
[00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:02.353]  Now, is there a way to pull this out?
[00:17:02.353 --> 00:17:04.674]  I guess we'd have to take it back to conference committee?
[00:17:04.674 --> 00:17:22.121]  Well, the way is to, I mean, if we assume that the House passes it intact today with the National ID Card language included, then, you know, whatever pressure can be brought on the Senate to be aware of that and try to remove it before it's sent to the White House.
[00:17:23.248 --> 00:17:35.154]  Now, whereas the last national ID card bill that passed to create the foundation actually helped illegal aliens, Amnesty in a way, this is, would you say, neutral on illegal aliens or helping them?
[00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:36.675]  It really doesn't affect them.
[00:17:36.675 --> 00:17:39.356]  It's an inward-facing bill, just like a lot of the
[00:17:39.876 --> 00:17:43.560]  Post 9-11 stuff, including the terrorist act, this applies to U.S.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.020]  citizens.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.902]  About keeping the slaves in line, yeah.
[00:17:45.902 --> 00:17:46.202]  Sure.
[00:17:46.202 --> 00:17:48.724]  I mean, only law-abiding folks are going to do this.
[00:17:48.724 --> 00:17:49.605]  It's like gun control.
[00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:52.568]  It doesn't apply, by definition, it doesn't apply to criminals.
[00:17:52.568 --> 00:17:53.849]  202-224-3121.
[00:17:53.849 --> 00:17:59.134]  Jeff, I've got a whole other issue I want to bring up to you.
[00:17:59.134 --> 00:17:59.694]  Sure.
[00:17:59.694 --> 00:18:06.140]  And then I'll let you get out of here, and we're going to come back, folks, and talk to Bart, and Bill, and Ron, and Dave, and Gail, and everybody else, and cover some other news.
[00:18:07.515 --> 00:18:12.978]  Every day I see protesters being arrested right next to Bush supporters.
[00:18:12.978 --> 00:18:14.598]  No protesters allowed.
[00:18:14.598 --> 00:18:24.403]  This latest thing with this John Gascade, when Bush came into Memphis, he and other businesses got this call, hey we're federal agents, no anti-Bush signs in your window.
[00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:26.244]  He hadn't had an anti-Bush sign up.
[00:18:26.984 --> 00:18:30.407]  Until they did that, and he put one up saying, I have a First Amendment.
[00:18:30.407 --> 00:18:33.810]  I mean, this is really getting scary.
[00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:38.694]  And we know Clinton tried stuff like this, but he never did it to the extent Bush is.
[00:18:38.694 --> 00:18:40.976]  And are they just trying to condition us to accept this?
[00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:42.717]  How do we fight this?
[00:18:42.717 --> 00:18:44.538]  Well, it's this subservient mindset.
[00:18:44.538 --> 00:18:52.585]  I don't know if you heard when he was in Europe last month, and visiting some town in Germany, the police there
[00:18:53.055 --> 00:19:01.334]  You know, it's closed down the whole city and closed down the street and they told everybody to not come out of their balconies and not look at them, you know, avert their eyes from the
[00:19:02.185 --> 00:19:03.706]  From the maximum leader, so to speak.
[00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:09.308]  So it's definitely something that's accelerated in the last few years with this administration.
[00:19:09.308 --> 00:19:11.869]  The maximum leader, the great dear leader.
[00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:14.430]  Now, Jeff, I know you're a stickler.
[00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.431]  I've got to find out where you heard that or where you saw that.
[00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:30.557]  Because when he went to Africa a few years ago, one particular country, to the BBC, they shut down all the streets, put like 20,000 people in a sports stadium, bulldozed the shantytowns, just so he wouldn't have to look at it.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.545]  Yeah, it's really unbelievable and it's not the way it ought to be.
[00:19:35.545 --> 00:19:40.270]  I mean, I commend anyone in Memphis who stood up to that nonsense.
[00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.134]  You know, the Germans are very subservient to their government.
[00:19:43.912 --> 00:19:48.897]  I'm sorry for interrupting, but I mean, where did you hear that?
[00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:50.298]  It was widely reported.
[00:19:50.298 --> 00:19:52.580]  I can certainly dig it up and try to get it to you.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.982]  It was probably an AP story or something like that.
[00:19:54.982 --> 00:19:56.944]  That was about a month ago when he was in Germany.
[00:19:56.944 --> 00:19:58.045]  Well, I'll find out.
[00:19:58.045 --> 00:19:59.546]  See, this is the stuff I miss.
[00:19:59.546 --> 00:20:02.609]  I mean, imagine saying, don't come out on the street.
[00:20:02.609 --> 00:20:04.210]  Do not come out on your balcony.
[00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.032]  And I'm sure the Germans did it, didn't they?
[00:20:06.032 --> 00:20:06.833]  I'm sure they did.
[00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:07.954]  That's why they got Hitler.
[00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:09.441]  Right.
[00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:10.023]  I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:20:10.023 --> 00:20:11.386]  You wanted to commend the guy?
[00:20:11.386 --> 00:20:12.148]  Well, yeah.
[00:20:12.148 --> 00:20:15.536]  I mean, if the guy in Memphis... A, it's his property.
[00:20:15.536 --> 00:20:16.919]  He can put whatever sign-up he wants.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.023]  And B, he's got an absolute First Amendment right.
[00:20:21.023 --> 00:20:23.766]  So congratulations to him for putting that up.
[00:20:23.766 --> 00:20:25.808]  But Jeff, doesn't it make you want to pull your hair out?
[00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:28.030]  I mean, I know it makes the Congressman want to.
[00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.752]  And again, we're not for the Democrats here.
[00:20:29.752 --> 00:20:32.094]  I mean, you guys are Republicans.
[00:20:32.094 --> 00:20:36.178]  But I mean, this is getting Hitler-like.
[00:20:36.178 --> 00:20:38.480]  I mean, Hitler never said, don't come out on your balconies.
[00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:46.555]  Well, the unfortunate problem is that there's still a lot of people who are caught up in party politics.
[00:20:46.555 --> 00:20:47.335]  Actually, I apologize.
[00:20:47.335 --> 00:20:48.276]  I'm going to interrupt you again.
[00:20:48.276 --> 00:20:49.417]  I'm bad about that.
[00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:55.541]  Actually, when Hitler toured Paris, they told the people, do not come out on the streets, do not come out on your balconies.
[00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:56.602]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:20:56.602 --> 00:21:01.465]  Well, hopefully we've learned something in the 70 years since Hitler, right?
[00:21:01.465 --> 00:21:02.986]  Maybe not as much as we should have learned.
[00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:14.198]  You know, people need to reject party politics, and they need to have the integrity to say that, hey, what's wrong when the other side does it is wrong when our guy does it, too.
[00:21:14.198 --> 00:21:21.703]  And to the extent Republicans, you know, accept these things because it's Bush doing them, then they have no integrity.
[00:21:21.703 --> 00:21:27.347]  Shouldn't we just say, Hail Caesar, and start putting statues up in our homes and pray to?
[00:21:27.347 --> 00:21:28.088]  No, we shouldn't.
[00:21:28.088 --> 00:21:29.709]  We should resist this crap, Alex.
[00:21:30.225 --> 00:21:35.571]  But isn't that a sign of Al-Qaeda if you don't worship the maximum leader?
[00:21:35.571 --> 00:21:40.177]  Well, it certainly doesn't bode well, but we're still fighting.
[00:21:40.177 --> 00:21:41.658]  God bless you, Jeff Dyson.
[00:21:41.658 --> 00:21:42.619]  God bless Ron Paul.
[00:21:42.619 --> 00:21:43.000]  Take care.
