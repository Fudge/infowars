[00:00.000 --> 00:14.560]  I told you eight weeks ago that they were going to mimic globally what the
[00:14.560 --> 00:17.520]  communist Chinese had done with the lockdowns and that it would be a permanent
[00:17.520 --> 00:24.120]  state of emergency because if there's one death the global nanny state says
[00:24.120 --> 00:28.720]  that they must stop it and that's the talking point from the presidents the
[00:28.720 --> 00:33.440]  governors the so-called World Health Organization leaders and now Fauci last
[00:33.440 --> 00:38.120]  night in that chilling press conference said we will get rid of the social
[00:38.120 --> 00:44.360]  distancing and a lockdown and they talk to other world leaders once there are
[00:44.360 --> 00:52.800]  no more deaths and once no one has the cold virus that's been souped up yes
[00:52.800 --> 00:57.560]  this is it the world government bio attack we always knew was coming from
[00:57.560 --> 01:05.480]  the very medical tyranny deep state mad scientist led by dr. Faust are we
[01:05.480 --> 01:09.760]  looking at living with some sort of social distancing guidelines
[01:09.760 --> 01:13.320]  essentially essentially until there's treatment or a vaccine for example
[01:13.320 --> 01:17.240]  people looking forward to the summer talk about you know going to baseball
[01:17.240 --> 01:20.200]  games going to concerts we have political conventions over the summer
[01:20.200 --> 01:24.280]  are things like that possible or safe without a vaccine or a treatment
[01:24.280 --> 01:31.240]  yeah I think if we get to the part of the curve that dr. Burke showed yesterday
[01:31.240 --> 01:37.120]  when it goes down to essentially no new cases no deaths at a period of time I
[01:37.120 --> 01:41.760]  think it makes sense that you're gonna have to relax social distance distancing
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.240]  the one thing we hopefully would have in place and I believe we will have in
[01:46.240 --> 01:51.840]  place is a much more robust system to be able to identify someone who's infected
[01:51.840 --> 01:58.120]  isolate them and then do contact tracing because if you have a really good program
[01:58.120 --> 02:03.840]  of containment that prevents you from ever having to get into mitigation we're
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.240]  in mitigation right now that's what the social and physical distancing is the
[02:09.240 --> 02:15.520]  ultimate the ultimate solution to a virus that might keep coming back would
[02:15.520 --> 02:22.040]  be a vaccine in fact I was on the weekly conference call with the WHO sponsored
[02:22.040 --> 02:27.200]  group of all the health leaders in the world who are dealing with this and we
[02:27.200 --> 02:32.120]  all came to the agreement that we may have cycling with another season will
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.400]  be much better prepared we likely will have interventions but the ultimate
[02:36.400 --> 02:40.400]  game changer in this will be a vaccine the same way a vaccine for other
[02:40.400 --> 02:45.680]  diseases that was scourges in the past that now we don't even worry about that
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.320]  is a one-minute 21-second clip that you're gonna hear me play probably ten
[02:50.320 --> 02:55.240]  more times today on air because we're gonna analyze every facet of that that
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.160]  is the final confirmation that it's all absolutely staged with a real virus and
[03:01.160 --> 03:04.360]  it's the global takeover because now they're doing exactly what we said
[03:04.360 --> 03:07.760]  years ago and what I made films about and what they said they do in white
[03:07.760 --> 03:12.320]  papers like lockstep and the club of Rome documents that are public and say
[03:12.320 --> 03:18.880]  department random 200 to depopulate and now we've got to surveil you we've got
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.720]  to watch you we've got to control you we can't let anyone have the flu or a
[03:23.720 --> 03:28.320]  cold no one can die ever again but don't have nutrition and we've got to
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.000]  control your life and lock you up we've got to have forced inoculations and of
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.440]  course the coronavirus mutates more than flu viruses you have to get the exact
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.640]  mutation so it'll be a yearly injection of course
[03:45.560 --> 03:51.360]  oh and all the social distancing you haven't had your yearly or monthly shot
[03:51.360 --> 03:55.040]  well and you criticize it anyway you're not allowed to travel you're not allowed
[03:55.040 --> 03:58.520]  to live and even if you're the president say hydroxychloric one's helping
[03:58.520 --> 04:06.840]  zinc's helping shut up there's no hope except bill Gates nothing but Bill Gates
[04:06.840 --> 04:10.960]  and the hysteria is everywhere we've got dozens of clips like this but here's
[04:10.960 --> 04:14.880]  one of folks telling people not to be in their cars here it is
[04:14.880 --> 04:16.880]  your ass is grass
[04:16.880 --> 04:18.880]  do you understand?
[04:18.880 --> 04:20.880]  I'm so with this sh**
[04:20.880 --> 04:22.880]  tell me who your parents are
[04:22.880 --> 04:24.880]  I'll be looking after this
[04:24.880 --> 04:26.880]  go ahead put me on social media
[04:26.880 --> 04:28.880]  you're a little pop seriously
[04:28.880 --> 04:30.880]  seriously I call the cops
[04:30.880 --> 04:32.880]  okay I'm so scared
[04:32.880 --> 04:37.880]  when your noisy neighbor
[04:37.880 --> 04:39.880]  who's also nosy
[04:39.880 --> 04:42.880]  finds out that you're leaving
[04:42.880 --> 04:46.880]  they're outside but it's okay because they're an enforcer they have power now
[04:46.880 --> 04:50.880]  and they'll take every vaccine and they'll sit there and oversee death camps
[04:50.880 --> 04:51.880]  you don't have them
[04:51.880 --> 04:54.880]  guaranteed I mean this is it they're coming you thought that any state was bad
[04:54.880 --> 04:59.880]  get ready your slaves now
[04:59.880 --> 05:03.880]  in a constant search to upgrade your favorite formulas
[05:03.880 --> 05:07.880]  we brought you a new way to get your B-12 with the most effective and
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.880]  expensive form available
[05:09.880 --> 05:13.880]  Ultra-12 uses methylcobalamine
[05:13.880 --> 05:18.880]  a powerful way to get pure energy support for those serious about getting the B-12
[05:18.880 --> 05:22.880]  they need to fight deficiency and reach their peak
[05:22.880 --> 05:24.880]  the results are simple
[05:24.880 --> 05:30.880]  Ultra-12 can help make DNA help the body produce energy and blood cells
[05:30.880 --> 05:34.880]  and support healthy nerve and brain cells
[05:34.880 --> 05:37.880]  we're bringing Ultra-12 down 40%
[05:37.880 --> 05:42.880]  to make sure you get this product before we run out
[05:42.880 --> 05:46.880]  now you can finally upgrade your daily routine
[05:46.880 --> 05:51.880]  get Ultra-12 today at 40% off to support the infowars store
[05:51.880 --> 05:54.880]  and experience true B-12 power
[06:22.880 --> 06:28.880]  based on medical charity force inoculation
[06:28.880 --> 06:31.880]  robot surveillance
[06:31.880 --> 06:35.880]  and the general public turned into Stasi
[06:35.880 --> 06:38.880]  slash Nazi slash KGB
[06:38.880 --> 06:40.880]  Maoist enforcers
[06:40.880 --> 06:42.880]  and Fox Business is the worst
[06:42.880 --> 06:44.880]  they have all their hosts at home
[06:44.880 --> 06:46.880]  because it's too deadly for them to even go out
[06:46.880 --> 06:50.880]  and they've got ELMO
[06:50.880 --> 06:54.880]  they're talking to adults about how to wash their hands
[06:54.880 --> 06:58.880]  and I'm going to explain how this mind control works in a moment
[06:58.880 --> 07:23.880]  but first let's go ahead and go to this clip
[07:23.880 --> 07:28.880]  this creator of ELMO is a non-petafile convicted
[07:28.880 --> 07:32.880]  wash your hands for 20 seconds just like ELMO
[07:32.880 --> 07:34.880]  just like petafile ELMO
[07:34.880 --> 07:36.880]  combating the coronavirus
[07:36.880 --> 07:39.880]  unprepared to do whatever is necessary
[07:39.880 --> 07:43.880]  so
[07:43.880 --> 07:45.880]  governments all over the world want power
[07:45.880 --> 07:48.880]  the big mega corporations ride up the script
[07:48.880 --> 07:50.880]  they have their disease x-drills two years ago
[07:50.880 --> 07:55.880]  they have their event 201 for martial law of the coronavirus
[07:55.880 --> 07:57.880]  Pentagon is briefed on it
[07:57.880 --> 08:00.880]  200 billionaires
[08:00.880 --> 08:05.880]  and CEOs plus dump all of their major stock
[08:05.880 --> 08:07.880]  in some cases all of it
[08:07.880 --> 08:13.880]  most cases large portions of it
[08:13.880 --> 08:16.880]  in December and January at the very top of the market
[08:16.880 --> 08:19.880]  knowing full well what was going on
[08:19.880 --> 08:21.880]  now I have said in the last nine weeks
[08:21.880 --> 08:23.880]  since this really got cranking
[08:23.880 --> 08:24.880]  when this wasn't even a news issue
[08:24.880 --> 08:26.880]  I said you watch their lockdown over there
[08:26.880 --> 08:29.880]  this is man-made it's coming over here
[08:29.880 --> 08:31.880]  this is the new world order
[08:31.880 --> 08:33.880]  because they said in the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[08:33.880 --> 08:35.880]  not just lockstep 10 years ago
[08:35.880 --> 08:39.880]  but other documents that this was how by the year 2020
[08:39.880 --> 08:42.880]  they were going to bring in world government
[08:42.880 --> 08:44.880]  now in the last segment of this hour
[08:44.880 --> 08:48.880]  we put together an extremely informative powerful report
[08:48.880 --> 08:51.880]  that is going to premiere here
[08:51.880 --> 08:55.880]  that lays out admissions
[08:55.880 --> 08:57.880]  by the establishment technocrats
[08:57.880 --> 09:00.880]  that by 2020 they would launch the bio attack
[09:00.880 --> 09:02.880]  they said 2020
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.880]  we will have world government by 2020
[09:07.880 --> 09:10.880]  no matter how much money and how much blood it cost
[09:10.880 --> 09:15.880]  that is in congressional hearings in the 1980s and 90s
[09:15.880 --> 09:18.880]  we will have world government by 2020
[09:18.880 --> 09:25.880]  and it will be paid for with money and blood
[09:25.880 --> 09:27.880]  that's the exact quote, look it up
[09:27.880 --> 09:28.880]  so you said it
[09:28.880 --> 09:30.880]  and there's many other similar quotes
[09:30.880 --> 09:33.880]  and now they're announcing world government
[09:33.880 --> 09:34.880]  total surveillance
[09:34.880 --> 09:36.880]  they have the apps, they have the phones
[09:36.880 --> 09:37.880]  they have the drones
[09:37.880 --> 09:39.880]  that tracks you in live time
[09:39.880 --> 09:42.880]  and you go in every week and get your finger pricked
[09:42.880 --> 09:44.880]  and all these tests are rolling out
[09:44.880 --> 09:47.880]  they're already ready, they make you beg for them first
[09:47.880 --> 09:49.880]  dredgerport.com
[09:49.880 --> 09:51.880]  half of humanity on lockdown
[09:51.880 --> 09:53.880]  Bill Gates is the savior
[09:53.880 --> 09:55.880]  all over the news
[09:55.880 --> 09:57.880]  he predicted he's a hero
[09:57.880 --> 09:59.880]  when he's not hanging out at Jeffrey Epstein's house
[09:59.880 --> 10:00.880]  getting caught lying about it
[10:00.880 --> 10:04.880]  or funding secret programs with him
[10:04.880 --> 10:07.880]  or funding TV shows attacking your truly
[10:07.880 --> 10:09.880]  Bill Gates calls for nationwide social isolation policy
[10:09.880 --> 10:11.880]  to slow coronavirus spread
[10:11.880 --> 10:13.880]  now you can't even leave your house
[10:13.880 --> 10:14.880]  nobody's going to deliver your food
[10:14.880 --> 10:16.880]  notice they tighten the news
[10:16.880 --> 10:17.880]  they tighten the news
[10:17.880 --> 10:18.880]  they tighten the vice on your head
[10:18.880 --> 10:22.880]  and let me give you the big giant announcement
[10:22.880 --> 10:24.880]  I have told you for nine weeks
[10:24.880 --> 10:26.880]  that once they implement this
[10:26.880 --> 10:28.880]  if we cower and fear properly
[10:28.880 --> 10:30.880]  and grovel
[10:30.880 --> 10:32.880]  it will then become a permanent emergency
[10:32.880 --> 10:39.880]  by saying we can't let one person die from this virus
[10:39.880 --> 10:41.880]  and so until there's no death
[10:41.880 --> 10:44.880]  zero out of seven and a half billion people
[10:44.880 --> 10:50.880]  it's impossible
[10:50.880 --> 10:52.880]  we are going to keep the social distancing
[10:52.880 --> 10:54.880]  and the lockdown in place
[10:54.880 --> 10:56.880]  and Fauci said just that last night
[10:56.880 --> 10:59.880]  and he said I just talked to all the world leaders last night
[10:59.880 --> 11:01.880]  all the big world health leaders
[11:01.880 --> 11:03.880]  and they agree only the vaccine will save us
[11:03.880 --> 11:05.880]  now they know the public's ignorant on average
[11:05.880 --> 11:09.880]  about virology and all of these systems
[11:09.880 --> 11:12.880]  and the immune system
[11:12.880 --> 11:15.880]  immunology
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.880]  you understand that the coronavirus is the most common virus on terra firma
[11:19.880 --> 11:22.880]  it's everywhere
[11:22.880 --> 11:23.880]  it's the cold virus
[11:23.880 --> 11:24.880]  it's the common cold
[11:24.880 --> 11:26.880]  and you always heard of you read bio weapons manuals
[11:26.880 --> 11:27.880]  and studies and commerce
[11:27.880 --> 11:31.880]  they were always worried about someone weaponizing the common cold
[11:31.880 --> 11:33.880]  because the common cold already kills they estimate
[11:33.880 --> 11:37.880]  around 50 million people a year globally
[11:37.880 --> 11:40.880]  look it up
[11:40.880 --> 11:42.880]  so you can hype up the common cold
[11:42.880 --> 11:44.880]  and show people that are always dying
[11:44.880 --> 11:45.880]  hype up what's happening in the hospitals
[11:45.880 --> 11:46.880]  create incredible fear
[11:46.880 --> 11:47.880]  but it isn't just the common cold
[11:47.880 --> 11:48.880]  it reinfects it comes back
[11:48.880 --> 11:50.880]  it's a nasty virus
[11:50.880 --> 11:54.880]  that's settled
[11:54.880 --> 11:57.880]  but the people launching it are ones that said they want world government
[11:57.880 --> 11:59.880]  and want to depopulate
[11:59.880 --> 12:00.880]  on record
[12:00.880 --> 12:03.880]  and now they're the savers that want to save old people
[12:03.880 --> 12:06.880]  and they'll do anything to save old people
[12:06.880 --> 12:09.880]  and of course we told you eight nine weeks ago
[12:09.880 --> 12:11.880]  that it was mainly killing men
[12:11.880 --> 12:13.880]  it's not just old people folks
[12:13.880 --> 12:18.880]  it's men
[12:18.880 --> 12:20.880]  we're going to get to those statistics today
[12:20.880 --> 12:23.880]  it's a weapon
[12:23.880 --> 12:25.880]  but
[12:25.880 --> 12:27.880]  you have to be deficient
[12:27.880 --> 12:30.880]  all of the evidence is mounting
[12:30.880 --> 12:32.880]  of zinc and vitamin D
[12:32.880 --> 12:34.880]  and vitamin C
[12:34.880 --> 12:36.880]  to be able to die from it
[12:36.880 --> 12:38.880]  because those are defenses
[12:38.880 --> 12:40.880]  zinc blocks it inside and out to the cell
[12:40.880 --> 12:42.880]  go to NIH and type in zinc
[12:42.880 --> 12:44.880]  we've saved it they'll probably take it down
[12:44.880 --> 12:46.880]  it says it protects the cells
[12:46.880 --> 12:47.880]  immunity
[12:47.880 --> 12:49.880]  and it's essential you die without it
[12:49.880 --> 12:51.880]  but they won't give it to children
[12:51.880 --> 12:54.880]  or old people or men
[12:54.880 --> 12:56.880]  and doctors can always order it
[12:56.880 --> 12:59.880]  and order prescriptions even though it wasn't a drug
[12:59.880 --> 13:01.880]  they could have it covered by insurance
[13:01.880 --> 13:03.880]  guess what we're getting calls and I confirmed it
[13:03.880 --> 13:05.880]  suddenly the FDA is saying
[13:05.880 --> 13:07.880]  we're not covering zinc and vitamin C
[13:07.880 --> 13:08.880]  you're not getting it
[13:08.880 --> 13:11.880]  you dirty filthy scum
[13:11.880 --> 13:13.880]  and media matters
[13:13.880 --> 13:15.880]  George Soros is firm
[13:15.880 --> 13:17.880]  and the groups that bet against the stock market
[13:17.880 --> 13:19.880]  like Ackerman
[13:19.880 --> 13:21.880]  are out there saying
[13:21.880 --> 13:23.880]  you don't take vitamin C
[13:23.880 --> 13:25.880]  and you don't take zinc
[13:25.880 --> 13:27.880]  and you lay down and you die
[13:27.880 --> 13:29.880]  these people hate you and your family
[13:29.880 --> 13:31.880]  and they want maximum death out of this
[13:31.880 --> 13:34.880]  to scare the hell out of everyone
[13:34.880 --> 13:37.880]  we come back I'm going to play Fauci saying all this
[13:37.880 --> 13:39.880]  but the first thing I want you to know is this
[13:41.880 --> 13:44.880]  my parents are strong healthy people
[13:44.880 --> 13:46.880]  my mom was a master swimmer
[13:46.880 --> 13:48.880]  didn't even get into swimming until she was 30
[13:48.880 --> 13:51.880]  and she beat people that got silver and gold medals in the Olympics
[13:51.880 --> 13:54.880]  so she used to go run triathlons and stuff
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.880]  she took a flu shot when UT said she should do it
[13:57.880 --> 14:00.880]  when she was like 48 years old
[14:00.880 --> 14:02.880]  and almost killed her
[14:02.880 --> 14:04.880]  and then she never competed again
[14:04.880 --> 14:05.880]  okay?
[14:05.880 --> 14:07.880]  but the team got sick
[14:08.880 --> 14:10.880]  she knows all this
[14:10.880 --> 14:12.880]  my own mother
[14:12.880 --> 14:14.880]  said
[14:14.880 --> 14:17.880]  don't come over here with your kids to the house
[14:17.880 --> 14:19.880]  so I went and talked to her and she said
[14:19.880 --> 14:21.880]  well actually I don't think it's a big deal
[14:21.880 --> 14:23.880]  but I just don't want to scare the neighbors
[14:23.880 --> 14:25.880]  and I just want to comply
[14:25.880 --> 14:28.880]  and I figured you do want to bring your kids up
[14:28.880 --> 14:30.880]  and I talked to my dad about it
[14:30.880 --> 14:32.880]  and they go well it is just a social thing
[14:32.880 --> 14:34.880]  during this
[14:34.880 --> 14:37.880]  and so everyone's showing to the other person
[14:37.880 --> 14:40.880]  almost everyone I talked to thinks it's bull
[14:40.880 --> 14:42.880]  I talked to an airline pilot yesterday
[14:42.880 --> 14:44.880]  a bunch of people
[14:44.880 --> 14:47.880]  they all think it's bull but they're still going along with it
[14:47.880 --> 14:49.880]  because they think everyone else is into it
[14:49.880 --> 14:51.880]  but national polls show the majority of people
[14:51.880 --> 14:53.880]  do think it's overhyped and fear mongering
[14:53.880 --> 14:55.880]  so see it's all of us enforcing on ourselves
[14:55.880 --> 14:58.880]  with adult television
[14:58.880 --> 15:00.880]  with Elmo telling us wash our hands
[15:00.880 --> 15:02.880]  that's an ad pointed at you
[15:02.880 --> 15:04.880]  like you're an idiot
[15:05.880 --> 15:07.880]  this is all about
[15:07.880 --> 15:09.880]  the end of the human civilization
[15:09.880 --> 15:11.880]  they're now admitting that every fall
[15:11.880 --> 15:13.880]  and every winter and spring
[15:13.880 --> 15:15.880]  that's three quarters of the year they're going to lock everybody down
[15:15.880 --> 15:17.880]  and you're going to work from home and you'll get passes
[15:17.880 --> 15:19.880]  to travel and do things this is it
[15:19.880 --> 15:21.880]  this is the AI takeover
[15:21.880 --> 15:23.880]  the megaopolis their official plan
[15:23.880 --> 15:25.880]  they're getting in game because it's their plan
[15:25.880 --> 15:27.880]  and big pharma and the globalist
[15:27.880 --> 15:29.880]  launched it through China
[15:29.880 --> 15:31.880]  Fauci's run it since the 80s
[15:31.880 --> 15:33.880]  they're all guilty with level 4
[15:33.880 --> 15:35.880]  bioweapons labs
[15:35.880 --> 15:37.880]  they're the cause they're big pharma
[15:37.880 --> 15:39.880]  they're the tyranny they're the enemy and here's a bigger key
[15:39.880 --> 15:41.880]  again they never
[15:41.880 --> 15:43.880]  they admit this the right flu virus
[15:43.880 --> 15:45.880]  mutation every year to ever give you immunity
[15:45.880 --> 15:47.880]  the flu
[15:47.880 --> 15:49.880]  inoculations never worked on record
[15:49.880 --> 15:51.880]  all it does is lower your immunity the next year
[15:51.880 --> 15:53.880]  the world is even more out of control
[15:53.880 --> 15:55.880]  no vaccine will ever work

[17:15.880 --> 17:17.880]  from China and Italy
[17:17.880 --> 17:19.880]  it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns

[17:21.880 --> 17:23.880]  listen while dehydrated food

[20:21.880 --> 20:23.880]  from the front lines
[20:23.880 --> 20:25.880]  of the information war
[20:25.880 --> 20:27.880]  it's Alex Jones
[20:29.880 --> 20:31.880]  so it's a giant hoax
[20:31.880 --> 20:33.880]  sure there's always been flu there's always been viruses
[20:33.880 --> 20:35.880]  there's been bio weapons
[20:35.880 --> 20:37.880]  released in the world war 2 on record the nazis did
[20:37.880 --> 20:39.880]  on the russians and others
[20:39.880 --> 20:41.880]  and there have been bio weapons that got out
[20:41.880 --> 20:43.880]  it's confirmed that Lyme disease
[20:43.880 --> 20:45.880]  was a US government weapon
[20:45.880 --> 20:47.880]  Plum Island
[20:47.880 --> 20:49.880]  the deer swim across a mile or so
[20:49.880 --> 20:51.880]  over to the mainland
[20:51.880 --> 20:53.880]  we're carrying the ticks that had it
[20:53.880 --> 20:55.880]  into New York and Connecticut
[20:55.880 --> 20:57.880]  and so the very groups
[20:57.880 --> 20:59.880]  that have this long history of doing this
[20:59.880 --> 21:01.880]  all these level 4 bio weapon labs
[21:01.880 --> 21:03.880]  and they admit
[21:03.880 --> 21:05.880]  that at least 3 times
[21:05.880 --> 21:07.880]  the Chinese have leaked
[21:07.880 --> 21:09.880]  stuff that's become global crises
[21:11.880 --> 21:13.880]  and now it happens again
[21:15.880 --> 21:17.880]  and we're told it came from a bat
[21:17.880 --> 21:19.880]  and humans
[21:19.880 --> 21:21.880]  came from a monkey
[21:21.880 --> 21:23.880]  fish frog
[21:23.880 --> 21:25.880]  married a turtle
[21:27.880 --> 21:29.880]  started getting some south park jokes there but
[21:31.880 --> 21:33.880]  they told us
[21:33.880 --> 21:35.880]  they would take over
[21:35.880 --> 21:37.880]  they drilled the corporations, the universities, the governments
[21:37.880 --> 21:39.880]  for the last 30-40 years
[21:39.880 --> 21:41.880]  that it would probably be a coronavirus
[21:41.880 --> 21:43.880]  that would mutate
[21:43.880 --> 21:45.880]  and be deadly, more deadly than the usual
[21:45.880 --> 21:47.880]  cold and that we'd have to end
[21:47.880 --> 21:49.880]  freedom as we know it
[21:49.880 --> 21:51.880]  and have total surveillance because of it
[21:53.880 --> 21:55.880]  and that's it
[21:55.880 --> 21:57.880]  because it's not a human attacking us
[21:57.880 --> 21:59.880]  it's this alien being
[21:59.880 --> 22:01.880]  but it is alien because it's man-made
[22:01.880 --> 22:03.880]  it's not of this world, it's not of a naturally occurring virus
[22:03.880 --> 22:05.880]  but it's man-made so that they
[22:05.880 --> 22:07.880]  know it's trajectory now
[22:07.880 --> 22:09.880]  20 years ago they couldn't do this
[22:09.880 --> 22:11.880]  now in the last 15 it's on record
[22:11.880 --> 22:13.880]  so imagine what else they've got
[22:13.880 --> 22:15.880]  they can edit and manufacture a virus
[22:15.880 --> 22:17.880]  and know how it's going to mutate
[22:17.880 --> 22:19.880]  30, 40, 50, 60 replications down
[22:23.880 --> 22:25.880]  so usually viruses mutate
[22:25.880 --> 22:27.880]  and then sometimes get deadly
[22:27.880 --> 22:29.880]  rarely and then they quickly burn themselves out
[22:29.880 --> 22:31.880]  this baby seems to be getting worse
[22:31.880 --> 22:33.880]  well I said that nine weeks ago
[22:33.880 --> 22:35.880]  I said these universities say it's man-made
[22:35.880 --> 22:37.880]  it's got all these different systems put on it
[22:37.880 --> 22:39.880]  it attacks four different parts of the body at least
[22:39.880 --> 22:41.880]  and it comes back
[22:41.880 --> 22:43.880]  soft-kill weapon
[22:43.880 --> 22:45.880]  people go wait, then I better be scared
[22:45.880 --> 22:47.880]  it doesn't matter
[22:47.880 --> 22:49.880]  it's here to take your rights
[22:49.880 --> 22:51.880]  they're saying now
[22:51.880 --> 22:53.880]  officially
[22:53.880 --> 22:55.880]  that if it saves one life
[22:55.880 --> 22:57.880]  well let's say they got rid of all the virus forever
[22:57.880 --> 22:59.880]  that's impossible
[22:59.880 --> 23:01.880]  then governments would just say somebody died from it
[23:01.880 --> 23:03.880]  and now because one person
[23:03.880 --> 23:05.880]  jumped off the side of a diving board
[23:05.880 --> 23:07.880]  once wrong in 1980
[23:07.880 --> 23:09.880]  they didn't jump out
[23:09.880 --> 23:11.880]  they jumped over like an idiot
[23:11.880 --> 23:13.880]  six feet to the side
[23:13.880 --> 23:15.880]  and broke their leg
[23:17.880 --> 23:19.880]  they sued the local pool
[23:19.880 --> 23:21.880]  and they got rid of the diving board and more lawsuits got filed
[23:21.880 --> 23:23.880]  we don't have diving boards
[23:23.880 --> 23:25.880]  we don't have dodgeball now most schools
[23:25.880 --> 23:27.880]  don't let people have tag or they're getting rid
[23:27.880 --> 23:29.880]  of physical education in many places
[23:29.880 --> 23:31.880]  because someone might get hurt
[23:31.880 --> 23:33.880]  they're trying to ban football
[23:33.880 --> 23:35.880]  and it's that mindset and now
[23:35.880 --> 23:37.880]  if someone might die
[23:37.880 --> 23:39.880]  from a virus
[23:39.880 --> 23:41.880]  and so we will end the lockdown
[23:41.880 --> 23:43.880]  says the head officer
[23:43.880 --> 23:45.880]  running this
[23:45.880 --> 23:47.880]  who has worked for Bill Gates for 30 years
[23:47.880 --> 23:49.880]  gotten 100 billion dollar grants
[23:49.880 --> 23:51.880]  Dr. Fauci
[23:51.880 --> 23:53.880]  so Bill Gates is operative
[23:53.880 --> 23:55.880]  and it looks like Trump's in with Bill Gates
[23:55.880 --> 23:57.880]  I think Trump overall is a good guy
[23:57.880 --> 23:59.880]  but I mean he didn't go with
[23:59.880 --> 24:01.880]  Bezos and
[24:01.880 --> 24:03.880]  Amazon for putting the Pentagon on the cloud
[24:03.880 --> 24:05.880]  shouldn't be on a cloud
[24:05.880 --> 24:07.880]  of somebody else's
[24:07.880 --> 24:09.880]  that's treason right there
[24:09.880 --> 24:11.880]  and instead Microsoft gets the contract
[24:13.880 --> 24:15.880]  I mean
[24:15.880 --> 24:17.880]  Bill Gates has really
[24:17.880 --> 24:19.880]  cozied up to
[24:19.880 --> 24:21.880]  the trumpet
[24:21.880 --> 24:23.880]  and the orange van and it's just out of control folks
[24:23.880 --> 24:25.880]  I'm just telling you like it is
[24:25.880 --> 24:27.880]  so
[24:27.880 --> 24:29.880]  there's all this delusion out there
[24:29.880 --> 24:31.880]  people are scared when this happens they want to believe good news
[24:31.880 --> 24:33.880]  we're rounding up all the criminals
[24:33.880 --> 24:35.880]  and Q says everything's about to stop
[24:35.880 --> 24:37.880]  and Q says that this is all a master plan of Trump
[24:37.880 --> 24:39.880]  no it's the same people
[24:39.880 --> 24:41.880]  that have been trying to take Trump out doing this
[24:41.880 --> 24:43.880]  he's riding the tiger and embracing it
[24:43.880 --> 24:45.880]  as we advise him to do so they don't remove him during the crisis
[24:45.880 --> 24:47.880]  because the public bought the hysteria
[24:47.880 --> 24:49.880]  he had to partially go with it
[24:49.880 --> 24:51.880]  so he's in a leadership position to then dial it back
[24:51.880 --> 24:53.880]  which he's trying to do
[24:53.880 --> 24:55.880]  but Fauci
[24:57.880 --> 24:59.880]  is up there saying I talked to
[24:59.880 --> 25:01.880]  all the other world leaders
[25:01.880 --> 25:03.880]  over medicine of the major governments
[25:03.880 --> 25:05.880]  and we can't let there be one death
[25:07.880 --> 25:09.880]  and the lockdown can never stop
[25:09.880 --> 25:11.880]  well you notice China announced the lockdown again today
[25:11.880 --> 25:13.880]  oh coz it popped back up it's any province
[25:13.880 --> 25:15.880]  they want to round up political dissidents
[25:15.880 --> 25:17.880]  any province they want to shut down it's total
[25:17.880 --> 25:19.880]  power
[25:19.880 --> 25:21.880]  and they said they'd do it
[25:21.880 --> 25:23.880]  in all these documents we covered in the last
[25:23.880 --> 25:25.880]  segment of this hour very powerful report
[25:25.880 --> 25:27.880]  we're about to premiere very powerful
[25:27.880 --> 25:29.880]  very proud of it
[25:29.880 --> 25:31.880]  first rate Rob do stayed up super late
[25:31.880 --> 25:33.880]  with Jeremy Braden others get this done
[25:33.880 --> 25:35.880]  so
[25:35.880 --> 25:37.880]  I'll tell you about that coming up it's so critical
[25:37.880 --> 25:39.880]  but let's
[25:39.880 --> 25:41.880]  go out to break with Fauci
[25:41.880 --> 25:43.880]  I want you to listen to what he says
[25:43.880 --> 25:45.880]  and when we come back I'm going to go through this
[25:45.880 --> 25:47.880]  minute 21 second clip
[25:47.880 --> 25:49.880]  it'll take probably five minutes to start and stop
[25:49.880 --> 25:51.880]  because the whole agenda
[25:51.880 --> 25:53.880]  and he is as happy as a pig in
[25:53.880 --> 25:55.880]  SH-T
[25:55.880 --> 25:57.880]  I mean he looks like he's having an orgasm
[25:57.880 --> 25:59.880]  because his guild
[25:59.880 --> 26:01.880]  his mad scientist guild this guy leads
[26:01.880 --> 26:03.880]  the level four bio weapons labs
[26:05.880 --> 26:07.880]  a villain we told you this you know
[26:07.880 --> 26:09.880]  ten weeks ago he started trying to sabotage
[26:09.880 --> 26:11.880]  Trump was about to fire him so now he asks friendly
[26:11.880 --> 26:13.880]  to Trump but only to stab him in the back later once the
[26:13.880 --> 26:15.880]  depression hits
[26:15.880 --> 26:17.880]  and Trump knows that
[26:17.880 --> 26:19.880]  and you notice our advice to the president's been dead on
[26:19.880 --> 26:21.880]  ahead of the curve and Trump's listening
[26:21.880 --> 26:23.880]  that's no brag just facts people understand
[26:23.880 --> 26:25.880]  the importance of this broadcast that you've commissioned
[26:25.880 --> 26:27.880]  that you finance that you fund to keep
[26:27.880 --> 26:29.880]  us in the game to give the president real analysis
[26:29.880 --> 26:31.880]  when no everyone else is scared
[26:31.880 --> 26:33.880]  because you go up against these globalist
[26:33.880 --> 26:35.880]  and you're not just a yes man they will
[26:35.880 --> 26:37.880]  try to kill you sue you
[26:37.880 --> 26:39.880]  sabotage you lie about you well that's fine
[26:39.880 --> 26:41.880]  because we're all dead anyways if they get their way
[26:41.880 --> 26:43.880]  they've announced a world government
[26:43.880 --> 26:45.880]  depopulation plan
[26:45.880 --> 26:47.880]  my god folks
[26:47.880 --> 26:49.880]  people keep asking how's everything coming true
[26:49.880 --> 26:51.880]  Jones said it's not coming
[26:51.880 --> 26:53.880]  true
[26:53.880 --> 26:55.880]  if there's a
[26:55.880 --> 26:57.880]  cleaning lady at somebody's house and somebody leaves
[26:57.880 --> 26:59.880]  a file out and she moves it and falls over
[26:59.880 --> 27:01.880]  and opens up and
[27:01.880 --> 27:03.880]  there's child porn
[27:03.880 --> 27:05.880]  and images of kids being tortured to death
[27:07.880 --> 27:09.880]  it doesn't come true when she gives it to the police
[27:09.880 --> 27:11.880]  and they go bust them it already
[27:11.880 --> 27:13.880]  happened
[27:13.880 --> 27:15.880]  it's like finding the plans
[27:15.880 --> 27:17.880]  to you know rob a bank
[27:17.880 --> 27:19.880]  they already are planning it so
[27:19.880 --> 27:21.880]  when it starts happening
[27:21.880 --> 27:23.880]  we have the damn plans
[27:23.880 --> 27:25.880]  holy Toledo
[27:25.880 --> 27:27.880]  we're going to go to break with Fauci
[27:27.880 --> 27:29.880]  here he is laying out your futures
[27:29.880 --> 27:31.880]  permanent lockdown because there's always going to be
[27:31.880 --> 27:33.880]  new viruses forced inoculations
[27:33.880 --> 27:35.880]  it's just it's a nightmare it's their takeover here it is
[27:35.880 --> 27:37.880]  possible or safe
[27:37.880 --> 27:39.880]  without a vaccine or a treatment in case
[27:39.880 --> 27:41.880]  yeah I think if we get to the
[27:41.880 --> 27:43.880]  part of the curve that
[27:43.880 --> 27:45.880]  Dr. Burke showed yesterday
[27:45.880 --> 27:47.880]  when it goes down to essentially
[27:47.880 --> 27:49.880]  no new cases
[27:49.880 --> 27:51.880]  no deaths at a period of time
[27:51.880 --> 27:53.880]  I think it makes sense that you're going to
[27:53.880 --> 27:55.880]  have to relax social distancing
[27:55.880 --> 27:57.880]  the one thing we
[27:57.880 --> 27:59.880]  hopefully would have in place
[27:59.880 --> 28:01.880]  and I believe we will have in place
[28:01.880 --> 28:03.880]  is a much more robust system
[28:03.880 --> 28:05.880]  to be able to identify someone
[28:05.880 --> 28:07.880]  who's infected isolate them
[28:07.880 --> 28:09.880]  and then do contact tracing
[28:09.880 --> 28:11.880]  because if you have a really good
[28:11.880 --> 28:13.880]  program of containment
[28:13.880 --> 28:15.880]  that prevents you from
[28:15.880 --> 28:17.880]  ever having to get into mitigation
[28:17.880 --> 28:19.880]  we're in mitigation right now
[28:19.880 --> 28:21.880]  that's what the social and
[28:21.880 --> 28:23.880]  physical distancing is
[28:23.880 --> 28:25.880]  the ultimate the ultimate
[28:25.880 --> 28:27.880]  solution to a virus
[28:27.880 --> 28:29.880]  that might keep coming back
[28:29.880 --> 28:31.880]  would be a vaccine
[28:31.880 --> 28:33.880]  in fact I was on the weekly
[28:33.880 --> 28:35.880]  conference call with the WHO
[28:35.880 --> 28:37.880]  sponsored group of
[28:37.880 --> 28:39.880]  all the health leaders in the world
[28:39.880 --> 28:41.880]  who are dealing with this
[28:41.880 --> 28:43.880]  and we all came to the agreement
[28:43.880 --> 28:45.880]  that we may have cycling
[28:45.880 --> 28:47.880]  with another season
[28:47.880 --> 28:49.880]  will be much better prepared
[28:49.880 --> 28:51.880]  we likely will have interventions
[28:51.880 --> 28:53.880]  but the ultimate game changer in this
[28:53.880 --> 28:55.880]  will be a vaccine the same way
[28:55.880 --> 28:57.880]  a vaccine for other diseases
[28:57.880 --> 28:59.880]  that was scourges in the past
[28:59.880 --> 29:01.880]  we can all agree these are troubled times right

[30:13.880 --> 30:15.880]  I remember that interview he said he was going to do it

[30:17.880 --> 30:19.880]  four years ago
[30:19.880 --> 30:21.880]  then billionaire businessman
[30:21.880 --> 30:23.880]  Donald Trump pledged
[30:23.880 --> 30:25.880]  himself to info wars in our
[30:25.880 --> 30:27.880]  audience that he would not let us
[30:27.880 --> 30:29.880]  down that he would take the global
[30:29.880 --> 30:31.880]  aston and that we would be very
[30:31.880 --> 30:33.880]  pleased with what he did
[30:33.880 --> 30:35.880]  we are pleased with President Trump
[30:35.880 --> 30:37.880]  he has proven that he's the real deal

[30:39.880 --> 30:41.880]  level that we've ever seen
[30:41.880 --> 30:43.880]  but now they're striking back

[32:07.880 --> 32:09.880]  coming after innocent people
[32:09.880 --> 32:11.880]  and I've been fighting them for 13 years
[32:11.880 --> 32:13.880]  and I'll never stop
[32:13.880 --> 32:15.880]  while I'm drawing breath
[32:15.880 --> 32:17.880]  for 26 years Alex Jones
[32:17.880 --> 32:19.880]  and info wars have been
[32:19.880 --> 32:21.880]  sounding the alarm for patriots
[32:21.880 --> 32:23.880]  worldwide
[32:23.880 --> 32:25.880]  waking people up to the new world
[32:25.880 --> 32:27.880]  order bohemian grove
[32:27.880 --> 32:29.880]  the American deep state
[32:29.880 --> 32:31.880]  the rise of communist China
[32:31.880 --> 32:33.880]  the plan for global
[32:33.880 --> 32:35.880]  depopulation
[32:35.880 --> 32:37.880]  and global elite pedophiles
[32:37.880 --> 32:39.880]  who pray off of our young
[32:39.880 --> 32:41.880]  the enemy has done their best
[32:41.880 --> 32:43.880]  to destroy us
[32:43.880 --> 32:45.880]  but because of your support
[32:45.880 --> 32:47.880]  our fight continues
[32:47.880 --> 32:49.880]  join us
[32:49.880 --> 32:51.880]  support the info war
[32:51.880 --> 32:53.880]  and together we will slay the dragon
[32:53.880 --> 32:55.880]  keep fighting Alex you're the gladiator
[32:55.880 --> 32:57.880]  once you're the gladiator
[33:25.880 --> 33:27.880]  Alex Jones
[33:27.880 --> 33:29.880]  I know there's a lot of Psyops
[33:29.880 --> 33:31.880]  going on on the internet
[33:31.880 --> 33:33.880]  all the places were banned youtube, twitter, facebook
[33:33.880 --> 33:35.880]  and you see youtube, twitter, facebook
[33:35.880 --> 33:37.880]  boosting posts
[33:37.880 --> 33:39.880]  that say Trump's secretly taking over
[33:39.880 --> 33:41.880]  Trump's secretly defeating the deep state
[33:41.880 --> 33:43.880]  the
[33:43.880 --> 33:45.880]  hospital ships are really
[33:45.880 --> 33:47.880]  holding prisoners
[33:47.880 --> 33:49.880]  and Hillary's been arrested
[33:49.880 --> 33:51.880]  and she's in Guantanamo
[33:51.880 --> 33:53.880]  none of that's true
[33:53.880 --> 33:55.880]  so conservatives
[33:55.880 --> 33:57.880]  don't come out and say
[33:57.880 --> 33:59.880]  this is wrong, what's happening
[33:59.880 --> 34:01.880]  and this is our bill of rights and constitution being overthrown
[34:01.880 --> 34:03.880]  you had
[34:03.880 --> 34:05.880]  20 governors last time I checked
[34:05.880 --> 34:07.880]  now they've all backpedaled
[34:07.880 --> 34:09.880]  saying
[34:09.880 --> 34:11.880]  do not give vitamin c, do not give zinc
[34:11.880 --> 34:13.880]  do not give z-pack, do not give
[34:13.880 --> 34:15.880]  hydroxychloroquine
[34:15.880 --> 34:17.880]  and they found out doctors were indeed giving people
[34:17.880 --> 34:19.880]  tonic because it has the natural form of it
[34:19.880 --> 34:21.880]  the original form of it
[34:21.880 --> 34:23.880]  British medicine, what's called a tonic
[34:23.880 --> 34:25.880]  they made the troops take
[34:25.880 --> 34:27.880]  and you saw
[34:27.880 --> 34:29.880]  all hell break loose against Trump, Balasaro
[34:29.880 --> 34:31.880]  Tucker Carlson
[34:33.880 --> 34:35.880]  Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity
[34:35.880 --> 34:37.880]  Project Veritas
[34:37.880 --> 34:39.880]  got their videos banned
[34:39.880 --> 34:41.880]  because Oliver Darcy paddled
[34:41.880 --> 34:43.880]  and said look they're talking to nurses and doctors
[34:43.880 --> 34:45.880]  and they're saying they think it's hyped up
[34:45.880 --> 34:47.880]  you're not allowed to talk to doctors
[34:47.880 --> 34:49.880]  and say it's overblown
[34:49.880 --> 34:51.880]  no hope is allowed
[34:51.880 --> 34:53.880]  that's a
[34:53.880 --> 34:55.880]  concerted authoritarian
[34:55.880 --> 34:57.880]  move to shut down everybody's
[34:57.880 --> 34:59.880]  speech and it's deadly
[34:59.880 --> 35:01.880]  dangerous
[35:01.880 --> 35:03.880]  and yes we told
[35:03.880 --> 35:05.880]  Trump 8 weeks ago if you don't get ahead of this
[35:05.880 --> 35:07.880]  this is really at the economy
[35:07.880 --> 35:09.880]  they're going to use it to plunge the economy
[35:09.880 --> 35:11.880]  well now Trump's beginning to go overboard
[35:15.880 --> 35:17.880]  so we've known what
[35:17.880 --> 35:19.880]  the Rockefeller Foundation
[35:19.880 --> 35:21.880]  the Carnegie Foundation, the Microsoft
[35:21.880 --> 35:23.880]  Bill and the Gates operation wants
[35:23.880 --> 35:25.880]  why they set up the U.N
[35:25.880 --> 35:27.880]  Bill Gates's dab was involved in that
[35:27.880 --> 35:29.880]  not just the Planned Parenthood running
[35:29.880 --> 35:31.880]  these people mean business as I tell you
[35:33.880 --> 35:35.880]  and now they're saying
[35:35.880 --> 35:37.880]  no one can ever die and we've got
[35:37.880 --> 35:39.880]  whatever it takes, drones, checkpoints, a phone
[35:39.880 --> 35:41.880]  that scans you
[35:41.880 --> 35:43.880]  an app when you're non-essential
[35:43.880 --> 35:45.880]  you can't go out and we're bubble prisoners
[35:45.880 --> 35:47.880]  being herded into the bubble cities
[35:47.880 --> 35:49.880]  which Microsoft
[35:49.880 --> 35:51.880]  Apple, Google, Twitter
[35:51.880 --> 35:53.880]  Facebook, Amazon are all officially now
[35:53.880 --> 35:55.880]  building
[35:55.880 --> 35:57.880]  a little inner city smart grid
[35:57.880 --> 35:59.880]  and now oh we're going to seal buildings
[35:59.880 --> 36:01.880]  so that there's not a problem and oh we're going to scan you
[36:01.880 --> 36:03.880]  for viruses and oh we have a little fingerprint
[36:03.880 --> 36:05.880]  prick things that are coming out
[36:05.880 --> 36:07.880]  to let you know
[36:07.880 --> 36:09.880]  and then everyone gets into it
[36:09.880 --> 36:11.880]  and it's like a new form of hospitality
[36:11.880 --> 36:13.880]  or gentlemanliness
[36:13.880 --> 36:15.880]  manners to go oh I'm sorry
[36:15.880 --> 36:17.880]  first it was six feet
[36:17.880 --> 36:19.880]  now I can't get 27 feet away
[36:19.880 --> 36:21.880]  oh sorry
[36:21.880 --> 36:23.880]  oh my phone says I'm
[36:23.880 --> 36:25.880]  essential I get to go out
[36:25.880 --> 36:27.880]  my app says
[36:27.880 --> 36:29.880]  China has this in place now
[36:29.880 --> 36:31.880]  it's being announced for us here
[36:31.880 --> 36:33.880]  you know as Fauci says in the clip
[36:33.880 --> 36:35.880]  that I'm about to play again he says
[36:35.880 --> 36:37.880]  last night the press conference says oh we're going to have surveillance systems
[36:37.880 --> 36:39.880]  that know we're going to catch it
[36:39.880 --> 36:41.880]  and we're going to have people locked down
[36:41.880 --> 36:43.880]  in the press conference last night
[36:43.880 --> 36:45.880]  and
[36:45.880 --> 36:47.880]  we're going to probably have to cycle this
[36:47.880 --> 36:49.880]  and throttle it
[36:49.880 --> 36:51.880]  and oh oh you can't go out here you can't go out there
[36:51.880 --> 36:53.880]  they're going to have a county by county thing at first
[36:53.880 --> 36:55.880]  and just getting us all trained that we can't go out until we're told
[36:55.880 --> 36:57.880]  and that's really it is
[36:57.880 --> 36:59.880]  to keep us safe from the virus
[36:59.880 --> 37:01.880]  and we're so domesticated
[37:01.880 --> 37:03.880]  and so soft and such TV heads
[37:03.880 --> 37:05.880]  waddling around now
[37:05.880 --> 37:07.880]  on average that people are getting into it now
[37:07.880 --> 37:09.880]  because they don't want to go to work
[37:09.880 --> 37:11.880]  and most people at most jobs aren't even working anyways
[37:13.880 --> 37:15.880]  hospitals are empty
[37:15.880 --> 37:17.880]  all over the country because most surgeries
[37:17.880 --> 37:19.880]  are elective in things and people hypochondriac
[37:19.880 --> 37:21.880]  and people get constant medical stuff
[37:21.880 --> 37:23.880]  because they want the pain pills
[37:23.880 --> 37:25.880]  there are whole industries where they're doing
[37:25.880 --> 37:27.880]  constant surgeries per finger
[37:27.880 --> 37:29.880]  and people get you know surgeries every month
[37:29.880 --> 37:31.880]  so they get their pain pills
[37:31.880 --> 37:33.880]  whereas every time they put you under it causes brain damage
[37:33.880 --> 37:35.880]  now the reason for so many brain damage people everywhere
[37:35.880 --> 37:39.880]  have like 15 surgeries by 50
[37:39.880 --> 37:41.880]  type in anesthesia causes major brain damage
[37:41.880 --> 37:43.880]  every time so it's just dementia everywhere
[37:43.880 --> 37:45.880]  and the floor right in the water and people
[37:45.880 --> 37:47.880]  and they got you almost ready
[37:47.880 --> 37:49.880]  and now it's going to be
[37:49.880 --> 37:51.880]  yearly coronavirus vaccines
[37:51.880 --> 37:53.880]  oh and the flu is killing tens of thousands too
[37:53.880 --> 37:55.880]  so you got to have that where you can't fly
[37:55.880 --> 37:57.880]  you can't travel and bosses aren't getting
[37:57.880 --> 37:59.880]  employees you know jobs
[37:59.880 --> 38:01.880]  if they don't concur
[38:01.880 --> 38:05.880]  I mean after corona things changed
[38:05.880 --> 38:07.880]  and it's all scripted
[38:07.880 --> 38:09.880]  it's all admitted to be scripted
[38:09.880 --> 38:11.880]  but you had to have the censorship before
[38:11.880 --> 38:13.880]  because you couldn't have me on YouTube right now
[38:13.880 --> 38:15.880]  with 20 million views per video
[38:15.880 --> 38:17.880]  for everyone going gosh this guy talked about it for years
[38:17.880 --> 38:19.880]  he laid it all out
[38:19.880 --> 38:21.880]  no no no you can't have that you see
[38:21.880 --> 38:23.880]  so here's Fauci there's a consensus
[38:23.880 --> 38:25.880]  it's going to be a vaccine
[38:25.880 --> 38:27.880]  yeah we're going to cycle you know on and off
[38:27.880 --> 38:29.880]  during the season
[38:29.880 --> 38:31.880]  now you can't leave unless we say
[38:31.880 --> 38:33.880]  and notice it's first oh only bars
[38:33.880 --> 38:35.880]  and restaurants and no now it's
[38:35.880 --> 38:37.880]  you know you can't be at the park now
[38:37.880 --> 38:39.880]  first like well we wanted you to be
[38:39.880 --> 38:41.880]  at the park in Austin but now you can't
[38:41.880 --> 38:43.880]  and there are resting surfers who by themselves
[38:43.880 --> 38:45.880]  are out a quarter mile
[38:45.880 --> 38:47.880]  off the shore in California, Oregon
[38:47.880 --> 38:49.880]  and other areas the police come
[38:49.880 --> 38:51.880]  and they go out on their jet skis
[38:51.880 --> 38:53.880]  and they put you in handcuffs
[38:53.880 --> 38:55.880]  but the murderers and rapists, actual murderers
[38:55.880 --> 38:57.880]  I saw an article
[38:57.880 --> 38:59.880]  or in New York they released a guy
[38:59.880 --> 39:01.880]  that had killed his wife and daughter 10 years ago
[39:01.880 --> 39:03.880]  just murdered him, tied him up
[39:03.880 --> 39:05.880]  slipped their throats, he's out
[39:05.880 --> 39:07.880]  but boy if we catch you
[39:07.880 --> 39:09.880]  selling hand sanitizer that you already had
[39:09.880 --> 39:11.880]  you're going to jail Bob
[39:11.880 --> 39:13.880]  because it's about the general public
[39:13.880 --> 39:15.880]  being criminals because the criminals
[39:15.880 --> 39:17.880]  are taking over the governments
[39:17.880 --> 39:19.880]  and the blue cities let it
[39:19.880 --> 39:21.880]  and the big media let it
[39:21.880 --> 39:23.880]  and they did it all
[39:23.880 --> 39:25.880]  Trump everybody else is going along with it
[39:25.880 --> 39:27.880]  and everybody I talked to goes
[39:27.880 --> 39:29.880]  but you know it's bull
[39:29.880 --> 39:31.880]  it's way exaggerated
[39:31.880 --> 39:33.880]  they go yeah I know I just thought maybe you didn't want to shake hands
[39:33.880 --> 39:35.880]  so everyone just
[39:35.880 --> 39:37.880]  we're slaves, we act like slaves
[39:37.880 --> 39:39.880]  we're not a land of the free home of the brave
[39:39.880 --> 39:41.880]  they would never try this before
[39:41.880 --> 39:43.880]  now they've got the surveillance, now they've got the control
[39:43.880 --> 39:45.880]  and we've gone along with it
[39:45.880 --> 39:47.880]  and so they're going to take everything
[39:47.880 --> 39:49.880]  you've got folks
[39:49.880 --> 39:51.880]  and they're going to slowly kill you with the coronavirus vaccines
[39:51.880 --> 39:53.880]  and coronavirus vaccines
[39:53.880 --> 39:55.880]  are already been developed
[39:55.880 --> 39:57.880]  and they're going to roll them out after you beg for them
[39:57.880 --> 39:59.880]  let's go ahead
[39:59.880 --> 40:01.880]  and play Fauci again, here's Fauci last night
[40:01.880 --> 40:03.880]  telling you the emergency
[40:03.880 --> 40:05.880]  is never going to end
[40:05.880 --> 40:07.880]  of course not
[40:07.880 --> 40:09.880]  it's a power grab, it's a medical
[40:09.880 --> 40:11.880]  dictatorship that is going to
[40:11.880 --> 40:13.880]  forcibly inoculate you
[40:13.880 --> 40:15.880]  judges in Florida
[40:15.880 --> 40:17.880]  and New York have announced forced inoculations
[40:17.880 --> 40:19.880]  and had rulings
[40:19.880 --> 40:21.880]  judicial tyranny
[40:21.880 --> 40:23.880]  that when there's a vaccine
[40:23.880 --> 40:25.880]  you're going to take it
[40:25.880 --> 40:27.880]  or the police are coming
[40:27.880 --> 40:29.880]  to give you a lead
[40:29.880 --> 40:31.880]  inoculation
[40:31.880 --> 40:33.880]  and the drones
[40:33.880 --> 40:35.880]  are now being weaponized
[40:35.880 --> 40:37.880]  don't give us a
[40:37.880 --> 40:39.880]  oh the robots will enforce
[40:39.880 --> 40:41.880]  here's Fauci, here he is
[40:41.880 --> 40:43.880]  possible or safe without a vaccine
[40:43.880 --> 40:45.880]  or a treatment in place?
[40:45.880 --> 40:47.880]  I think if we get to the part of the curve
[40:47.880 --> 40:49.880]  that Dr. Burke
[40:49.880 --> 40:51.880]  showed yesterday when it goes down
[40:51.880 --> 40:53.880]  to essentially no
[40:53.880 --> 40:55.880]  new cases, no deaths
[40:55.880 --> 40:57.880]  at a period of time, I think it makes
[40:57.880 --> 40:59.880]  sense that you're going to have to relax
[40:59.880 --> 41:01.880]  social distancing
[41:01.880 --> 41:03.880]  the one thing we hopefully would have
[41:03.880 --> 41:05.880]  in place and I believe we will have
[41:05.880 --> 41:07.880]  in place is a much more
[41:07.880 --> 41:09.880]  robust system to be able
[41:09.880 --> 41:11.880]  to identify someone who's infected
[41:11.880 --> 41:13.880]  isolate them and then do contact tracing
[41:13.880 --> 41:15.880]  because if you have a really good
[41:15.880 --> 41:17.880]  program
[41:17.880 --> 41:19.880]  of containment
[41:19.880 --> 41:21.880]  that prevents you from ever having to
[41:21.880 --> 41:23.880]  get into mitigation
[41:23.880 --> 41:25.880]  we're in mitigation right now
[41:25.880 --> 41:27.880]  that's what the social and physical
[41:27.880 --> 41:29.880]  distancing is
[41:29.880 --> 41:31.880]  the ultimate solution
[41:31.880 --> 41:33.880]  to a virus that might
[41:33.880 --> 41:35.880]  keep coming back
[41:35.880 --> 41:37.880]  would be a vaccine
[41:37.880 --> 41:39.880]  in fact I was on the weekly conference call
[41:39.880 --> 41:41.880]  with the WHO
[41:41.880 --> 41:43.880]  sponsored group
[41:43.880 --> 41:45.880]  in the world
[41:45.880 --> 41:47.880]  Planet Hypochondria
[41:47.880 --> 41:49.880]  Planet Slay
[41:49.880 --> 41:51.880]  oh yeah
[41:51.880 --> 41:53.880]  oh yeah
[41:53.880 --> 41:55.880]  locking you down
[41:55.880 --> 41:57.880]  but the ultimate game changer in this will be
[41:57.880 --> 41:59.880]  a vaccine the same way a vaccine
[41:59.880 --> 42:01.880]  for other diseases
[42:01.880 --> 42:03.880]  even though they never can guess the right flu
[42:03.880 --> 42:05.880]  or cold vaccine
[42:05.880 --> 42:07.880]  why could they never have a vaccine for the cold
[42:07.880 --> 42:09.880]  the coronavirus is the main cold bug
[42:09.880 --> 42:11.880]  because it's always changing
[42:11.880 --> 42:13.880]  it's got to be exact
[42:13.880 --> 42:15.880]  but they don't care Bill Gates wants in your body
[42:15.880 --> 42:17.880]  he says there's too many of you
[42:17.880 --> 42:19.880]  he says vaccines will reduce your fertility on record
[42:19.880 --> 42:21.880]  and he wants in your body and he'll get in there
[42:21.880 --> 42:23.880]  they couldn't abort you and your mommy
[42:23.880 --> 42:25.880]  they're gonna abort your ass now
[42:25.880 --> 42:27.880]  it'll kill you slow and the medical system will suck your money out
[42:27.880 --> 42:29.880]  while they do it and the taxpayers
[42:29.880 --> 42:31.880]  will pay for liability protection
[42:31.880 --> 42:33.880]  but they're talking about giving total liability protection
[42:33.880 --> 42:35.880]  period where you can't even get a settlement for vaccine damage
[42:35.880 --> 42:37.880]  they're gonna kill all of you
[42:37.880 --> 42:39.880]  and you're gonna love it
[42:39.880 --> 42:41.880]  military everybody prepare to die
[42:41.880 --> 42:43.880]  the robots are replacing you
[42:43.880 --> 42:45.880]  and whatever you do don't get X3, 60% off
[42:45.880 --> 42:47.880]  don't get our ultimate
[42:47.880 --> 42:49.880]  products here like the real Red Pill Plus
[42:49.880 --> 42:51.880]  with all of Adam's Minerals Zinc
[42:51.880 --> 42:53.880]  do not, it will not help you
[42:53.880 --> 43:21.880]  only vaccines, take them!
[43:23.880 --> 43:25.880]  most people don't even want anyways
[43:25.880 --> 43:27.880]  but scare everybody else you want to control
[43:27.880 --> 43:29.880]  into submission
[43:29.880 --> 43:31.880]  and that's what's going on
[43:31.880 --> 43:33.880]  so people get confused by the paradox
[43:33.880 --> 43:35.880]  you say it's a real virus, you say it's serious
[43:35.880 --> 43:37.880]  but you say don't panic and don't shut the economy down
[43:37.880 --> 43:39.880]  exactly because if you do that
[43:39.880 --> 43:41.880]  they're gonna keep releasing bioweapons over and over again
[43:41.880 --> 43:43.880]  because it works so well
[43:43.880 --> 43:45.880]  on the public
[43:45.880 --> 43:47.880]  most people are starting to wake up
[43:47.880 --> 43:49.880]  but we have to understand that
[43:49.880 --> 43:51.880]  pressures being put on Trump to basically keep the economy
[43:51.880 --> 43:53.880]  shut for another six months to a year
[43:53.880 --> 43:55.880]  will be a depression long before then
[43:55.880 --> 43:57.880]  we've got to go back to work
[43:57.880 --> 43:59.880]  my mind for more than eight weeks
[43:59.880 --> 44:01.880]  has been fixed
[44:01.880 --> 44:03.880]  constantly scanning, constantly
[44:03.880 --> 44:05.880]  computing
[44:05.880 --> 44:07.880]  to understand the strategic attack we're witnessing
[44:07.880 --> 44:09.880]  we know by the scripting
[44:09.880 --> 44:11.880]  and the choreography
[44:11.880 --> 44:13.880]  and the fact that the virus has been scanned
[44:13.880 --> 44:15.880]  that it's man-made and an attack on our economy
[44:15.880 --> 44:17.880]  the globalist media is firmly
[44:17.880 --> 44:19.880]  behind this devastating the United States
[44:19.880 --> 44:21.880]  and driving Trump from power
[44:21.880 --> 44:23.880]  but now we know
[44:23.880 --> 44:25.880]  from scores of studies
[44:25.880 --> 44:27.880]  from China, the UK, the United States, Europe
[44:27.880 --> 44:29.880]  Brazil, Japan
[44:29.880 --> 44:31.880]  that the virus
[44:31.880 --> 44:33.880]  reinfects and attacks different parts of the body
[44:33.880 --> 44:35.880]  that ladies and gentlemen
[44:35.880 --> 44:37.880]  is an engineered bioweapon
[44:37.880 --> 44:39.880]  just as the Indian scientists eight weeks ago
[44:39.880 --> 44:41.880]  conclusively proved their major university
[44:41.880 --> 44:43.880]  they have a name for it at the Pentagon
[44:45.880 --> 44:47.880]  it's called a soft kill weapon
[44:47.880 --> 44:49.880]  it doesn't kill you usually the first time
[44:49.880 --> 44:51.880]  but the next time
[44:51.880 --> 44:53.880]  or the third time or the fourth it does
[44:53.880 --> 44:55.880]  and it weighs down your economy in the process
[44:57.880 --> 44:59.880]  as men age
[44:59.880 --> 45:01.880]  they often experience
[45:01.880 --> 45:03.880]  a slowdown
[45:03.880 --> 45:05.880]  in vitality, energy
[45:05.880 --> 45:07.880]  and overall wellness
[45:07.880 --> 45:09.880]  and that's why we made
[45:09.880 --> 45:11.880]  one of our most popular formulas
[45:11.880 --> 45:13.880]  to date
[45:13.880 --> 45:15.880]  super male vitality
[45:15.880 --> 45:17.880]  specifically designed to assist the body
[45:17.880 --> 45:19.880]  in regulating
[45:19.880 --> 45:21.880]  proper balance
[45:21.880 --> 45:23.880]  to create superior vitality
[45:23.880 --> 45:25.880]  in males
[45:25.880 --> 45:27.880]  this unique formula
[45:27.880 --> 45:29.880]  promotes your body's own natural responses
[45:29.880 --> 45:31.880]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals
[45:31.880 --> 45:33.880]  and no
[45:33.880 --> 45:35.880]  unwanted additives
[45:35.880 --> 45:37.880]  yes, we're talking about
[45:37.880 --> 45:39.880]  ancient wisdom combined with
[45:39.880 --> 45:41.880]  modern technology
[45:41.880 --> 45:43.880]  working together in perfect
[45:43.880 --> 45:45.880]  synchronicity to help you get the most
[45:45.880 --> 45:47.880]  out of this herb packed formula
[45:47.880 --> 45:49.880]  so what are you waiting for?

[45:55.880 --> 46:15.880]  at N4store.com
[46:25.880 --> 46:27.880]  the video is posted on infowards.com
[46:55.880 --> 46:57.880]  congratulations
[47:25.880 --> 47:27.880]  here it is
[47:51.880 --> 47:53.880]  in 2005 the Wachowski brothers
[47:53.880 --> 47:55.880]  produced the archetypal film
[47:55.880 --> 47:57.880]  V for Vendetta
[47:57.880 --> 47:59.880]  and with almost prescient
[47:59.880 --> 48:01.880]  vision
[48:01.880 --> 48:03.880]  they predicted what is unfolding
[48:03.880 --> 48:05.880]  in the year 2020
[48:05.880 --> 48:07.880]  imagine a virus
[48:07.880 --> 48:09.880]  the most terrifying virus you can
[48:09.880 --> 48:11.880]  and then imagine that you and you alone
[48:11.880 --> 48:13.880]  have the cure
[48:13.880 --> 48:15.880]  but if your ultimate goal is power
[48:15.880 --> 48:17.880]  how best to use such a weapon?
[48:17.880 --> 48:19.880]  a newly elected government seeking
[48:19.880 --> 48:21.880]  power and control
[48:21.880 --> 48:23.880]  develops a secret bio weapon
[48:23.880 --> 48:25.880]  and launches it
[48:25.880 --> 48:27.880]  against its own population
[48:27.880 --> 48:29.880]  to establish authoritarian rule
[48:29.880 --> 48:31.880]  and to blame the attack
[48:31.880 --> 48:33.880]  on their political enemies
[48:33.880 --> 48:35.880]  taking pages
[48:35.880 --> 48:37.880]  right out of the 20th century
[48:37.880 --> 48:39.880]  we see this fictional
[48:39.880 --> 48:41.880]  dictatorship
[48:41.880 --> 48:43.880]  not just seeking to dominate and control the population
[48:43.880 --> 48:45.880]  but to be seen as saviors
[48:45.880 --> 48:47.880]  of the very people that they are
[48:47.880 --> 48:49.880]  dumbing down
[48:49.880 --> 48:51.880]  enslaving
[48:51.880 --> 48:53.880]  imprisoning and killing
[48:53.880 --> 48:55.880]  the writers had a deep
[48:55.880 --> 48:57.880]  historical well
[48:57.880 --> 48:59.880]  to work from in just the 20th
[48:59.880 --> 49:01.880]  century
[49:01.880 --> 49:03.880]  with monsters like Hitler, Stalin
[49:03.880 --> 49:05.880]  Mao, Pol Pot
[49:05.880 --> 49:07.880]  Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez
[49:07.880 --> 49:09.880]  Kim Jong-un
[49:09.880 --> 49:11.880]  who don't just seek to dominate
[49:11.880 --> 49:13.880]  and control the very lives and thoughts
[49:13.880 --> 49:15.880]  of their minions
[49:15.880 --> 49:17.880]  but who also want to be seen as the saviour
[49:17.880 --> 49:19.880]  by the very people who are their slaves
[49:19.880 --> 49:21.880]  tonight I will speak
[49:21.880 --> 49:23.880]  directly to these people
[49:23.880 --> 49:25.880]  and make the situation perfectly clear to them
[49:25.880 --> 49:27.880]  the security of this nation
[49:27.880 --> 49:29.880]  depends on complete
[49:29.880 --> 49:31.880]  and total compliance
[49:31.880 --> 49:33.880]  so of course in the film, those that release
[49:33.880 --> 49:35.880]  the bio weapon on their own
[49:35.880 --> 49:37.880]  population that they're preying on
[49:37.880 --> 49:39.880]  also have the cure
[49:39.880 --> 49:41.880]  lo and behold, a miracle
[49:43.880 --> 49:45.880]  some believed it was the work of God himself
[49:45.880 --> 49:47.880]  that it was a pharmaceutical company
[49:47.880 --> 49:49.880]  controlled by certain party members
[49:49.880 --> 49:51.880]  that made them all
[49:51.880 --> 49:53.880]  seemingly rich
[49:53.880 --> 49:55.880]  but the end result, the true genius
[49:55.880 --> 49:57.880]  of the plan was the fear
[49:57.880 --> 49:59.880]  fear became the ultimate tool
[49:59.880 --> 50:01.880]  of this government and through it
[50:01.880 --> 50:03.880]  our politician was ultimately appointed
[50:03.880 --> 50:05.880]  to the newly created position of high chancellor
[50:05.880 --> 50:07.880]  in v for vendetta
[50:07.880 --> 50:09.880]  we truly see art
[50:09.880 --> 50:11.880]  imitating life
[50:11.880 --> 50:13.880]  but when you fast forward to the year
[50:13.880 --> 50:15.880]  2019
[50:15.880 --> 50:17.880]  and then 2020, it's not
[50:17.880 --> 50:19.880]  the US government that has its fingerprints
[50:19.880 --> 50:21.880]  all over this, it's the private
[50:21.880 --> 50:23.880]  corporate global government
[50:23.880 --> 50:25.880]  and their testing ground
[50:25.880 --> 50:27.880]  the communist Chinese super state
[50:27.880 --> 50:29.880]  top scientists from across the world
[50:29.880 --> 50:31.880]  in India and Europe and other areas
[50:31.880 --> 50:33.880]  all came out early on and said
[50:33.880 --> 50:35.880]  this is clearly a man
[50:35.880 --> 50:37.880]  made coronavirus
[50:37.880 --> 50:39.880]  this is clearly an offensive
[50:39.880 --> 50:41.880]  biological warfare
[50:41.880 --> 50:43.880]  from the beginning, the entire event
[50:43.880 --> 50:45.880]  was carefully choreographed
[50:45.880 --> 50:47.880]  two years ago, the United Nations
[50:47.880 --> 50:49.880]  announced that disease X
[50:49.880 --> 50:51.880]  will soon arrive and that global
[50:51.880 --> 50:53.880]  government will be needed to counter
[50:53.880 --> 50:55.880]  the international crisis
[50:55.880 --> 50:57.880]  and that basic human liberties
[50:57.880 --> 50:59.880]  will have to be permanently erased
[50:59.880 --> 51:01.880]  in the name of global health
[51:01.880 --> 51:03.880]  and then in the fall of 2019
[51:03.880 --> 51:05.880]  the bill of millen de gates
[51:05.880 --> 51:07.880]  foundation holds event 201
[51:07.880 --> 51:09.880]  where 65 million people die
[51:09.880 --> 51:11.880]  from a corona like virus
[51:11.880 --> 51:13.880]  and the answer is quarantines
[51:13.880 --> 51:15.880]  lock downs, force inoculations
[51:15.880 --> 51:17.880]  robot drone enforcement
[51:17.880 --> 51:19.880]  and of course, world government
[51:19.880 --> 51:21.880]  from the beginning, the entire
[51:21.880 --> 51:23.880]  event was carefully choreographed
[51:23.880 --> 51:25.880]  a man made virus
[51:25.880 --> 51:27.880]  designed to
[51:27.880 --> 51:29.880]  not just attack four different parts
[51:29.880 --> 51:31.880]  of the body including male
[51:31.880 --> 51:33.880]  fertility and lungs
[51:33.880 --> 51:35.880]  but where did filmmakers like
[51:35.880 --> 51:37.880]  the Wachowski brothers get the idea
[51:37.880 --> 51:39.880]  for their script
[51:39.880 --> 51:41.880]  in history, a bio attack
[51:41.880 --> 51:43.880]  pointed at the population
[51:43.880 --> 51:45.880]  to enslave them
[51:45.880 --> 51:47.880]  certainly the Wachowski brothers produced
[51:47.880 --> 51:49.880]  a vivid and rich
[51:49.880 --> 51:51.880]  film that is a masterpiece
[51:51.880 --> 51:53.880]  but they weren't the first people in Hollywood
[51:53.880 --> 51:55.880]  or in popular culture to notice what was going on
[51:55.880 --> 51:57.880]  in official white papers
[51:57.880 --> 51:59.880]  I'll get to in a moment
[51:59.880 --> 52:01.880]  back in 1993, the Simpsons
[52:01.880 --> 52:03.880]  known for being prescient
[52:03.880 --> 52:05.880]  or being on the inside
[52:05.880 --> 52:07.880]  of a controlled bio weapon
[52:35.880 --> 52:37.880]  where are they getting these ideas?
[52:37.880 --> 52:39.880]  well, it turns out
[52:39.880 --> 52:41.880]  it goes back to Malthus
[52:41.880 --> 52:43.880]  more than 250 years ago
[52:43.880 --> 52:45.880]  in England
[52:45.880 --> 52:47.880]  who coined the term Malthusianism
[52:47.880 --> 52:49.880]  where the elite believes
[52:49.880 --> 52:51.880]  that they should release bio weapons
[52:51.880 --> 52:53.880]  or plagues on the population
[52:53.880 --> 52:55.880]  to reduce their numbers
[52:55.880 --> 52:57.880]  but Malthus is not the father
[52:57.880 --> 52:59.880]  of eugenics
[52:59.880 --> 53:01.880]  the father of eugenics is Plato
[53:01.880 --> 53:03.880]  who over 2,000 years ago
[53:03.880 --> 53:05.880]  in his republic
[53:05.880 --> 53:07.880]  wrote about hurting the poor
[53:07.880 --> 53:09.880]  into compact cities
[53:09.880 --> 53:11.880]  and releasing plagues upon them
[53:11.880 --> 53:13.880]  so where is popular culture getting its cue?
[53:13.880 --> 53:15.880]  well, from the club of Rome
[53:15.880 --> 53:17.880]  and public documents they put out in the 1960s
[53:17.880 --> 53:19.880]  calling for global forced
[53:19.880 --> 53:21.880]  depopulation
[53:21.880 --> 53:23.880]  and of course we have folks like Prince Philip
[53:23.880 --> 53:25.880]  Prince Charles' father, Queen Elizabeth's husband
[53:25.880 --> 53:27.880]  constantly in interviews saying
[53:27.880 --> 53:29.880]  he wants to come back as a deadly virus
[53:29.880 --> 53:31.880]  reincarnated to exterminate humanity
[53:31.880 --> 53:33.880]  in the event that I am reincarnated
[53:33.880 --> 53:35.880]  I would like to return as a deadly virus
[53:35.880 --> 53:37.880]  in order to contribute something
[53:37.880 --> 53:39.880]  to solve overpopulation
[53:39.880 --> 53:41.880]  Prince Philip, reported by
[53:41.880 --> 53:43.880]  Deutsche Press Agentur DPA
[53:43.880 --> 53:45.880]  August, 1988
[53:45.880 --> 53:47.880]  you see Bill Gates
[53:47.880 --> 53:49.880]  and Ted Turner and Warren Buffett
[53:49.880 --> 53:51.880]  and people like Oprah Winfrey
[53:51.880 --> 53:53.880]  when they meet to discuss depopulation
[53:53.880 --> 53:55.880]  in world government
[53:55.880 --> 53:57.880]  they're celebrated as wonderful good people
[53:57.880 --> 53:59.880]  when Bill Gates talks about
[53:59.880 --> 54:01.880]  getting rid of old people
[54:01.880 --> 54:03.880]  death panels so we all quote
[54:03.880 --> 54:05.880]  have more money
[54:05.880 --> 54:07.880]  or Newsweek talks about the case for killing Granny
[54:07.880 --> 54:09.880]  that's called the death panel
[54:09.880 --> 54:11.880]  and you're not supposed to have that discussion
[54:11.880 --> 54:13.880]  well, he's a savior when he puts up equations
[54:13.880 --> 54:15.880]  about reducing the human numbers
[54:15.880 --> 54:17.880]  down to zero to save the earth
[54:17.880 --> 54:19.880]  probably one of these numbers is going to have to get
[54:19.880 --> 54:21.880]  pretty near to zero
[54:21.880 --> 54:23.880]  that's back from a high school algebra
[54:23.880 --> 54:25.880]  but let's take a look
[54:25.880 --> 54:27.880]  and he's following the Rockefeller Foundation
[54:27.880 --> 54:29.880]  and Carnegie Endowment Plan
[54:29.880 --> 54:31.880]  that's over 120 years old
[54:31.880 --> 54:33.880]  in 2010
[54:33.880 --> 54:35.880]  the Rockefeller Foundation
[54:35.880 --> 54:37.880]  put out a lengthy white paper that's public
[54:37.880 --> 54:39.880]  and I suggest you go read it
[54:39.880 --> 54:41.880]  called Lockstep
[54:41.880 --> 54:43.880]  and it predicts an authoritarian world government
[54:43.880 --> 54:45.880]  will rise and crush
[54:45.880 --> 54:47.880]  the general public in the name
[54:47.880 --> 54:49.880]  of security and safety
[54:49.880 --> 54:51.880]  and now former British prime ministers
[54:51.880 --> 54:53.880]  and others are openly saying
[54:53.880 --> 54:55.880]  world government
[54:55.880 --> 54:57.880]  technology, an authoritarian
[54:57.880 --> 54:59.880]  rule of autocrats
[54:59.880 --> 55:01.880]  is the only thing that will keep
[55:01.880 --> 55:03.880]  humanity and our precious old people
[55:03.880 --> 55:05.880]  safe but these are the very same
[55:05.880 --> 55:07.880]  individuals saying we should get
[55:07.880 --> 55:09.880]  rid of the old people
[55:09.880 --> 55:11.880]  it was Benjamin Franklin that said
[55:11.880 --> 55:13.880]  those that will give up
[55:13.880 --> 55:15.880]  their liberties for security
[55:15.880 --> 55:17.880]  deserve and will
[55:17.880 --> 55:19.880]  get neither
[55:19.880 --> 55:21.880]  meaning you always get enslaved
[55:21.880 --> 55:23.880]  when you behave like a sheep
[55:23.880 --> 55:25.880]  wolves come
[55:25.880 --> 55:27.880]  and if you study who's running
[55:27.880 --> 55:29.880]  this whole pandemic hysteria
[55:29.880 --> 55:31.880]  it is known you Genesis
[55:31.880 --> 55:33.880]  that publicly say
[55:33.880 --> 55:35.880]  they want to reduce world population
[55:35.880 --> 55:37.880]  to at least 500 million
[55:37.880 --> 55:39.880]  these people are hyper predators
[55:39.880 --> 55:41.880]  and it is all about
[55:41.880 --> 55:43.880]  raw power and control
[55:43.880 --> 55:45.880]  and as soon as we start recognizing
[55:45.880 --> 55:47.880]  these spiders for what they are
[55:47.880 --> 55:49.880]  dangerous anti-human
[55:49.880 --> 55:51.880]  authoritarians and not saviors
[55:51.880 --> 55:53.880]  we learn our civilization around
[55:53.880 --> 55:55.880]  so when you see the incredible fear
[55:55.880 --> 55:57.880]  in the media of this virus
[55:57.880 --> 55:59.880]  that is a real bio weapon
[55:59.880 --> 56:01.880]  remember the end game is here
[56:01.880 --> 56:03.880]  locking you up in your homes
[56:03.880 --> 56:05.880]  surveilling you with drones
[56:05.880 --> 56:07.880]  not letting you leave your house unless you have the right app on your phone
[56:07.880 --> 56:09.880]  total absolute
[56:09.880 --> 56:11.880]  big brother AI enslavement
[56:11.880 --> 56:13.880]  the good news is humanity is
[56:13.880 --> 56:15.880]  awakening right now
[56:15.880 --> 56:17.880]  to the fact that it is the corrupt corporations
[56:17.880 --> 56:19.880]  and major globalist institutions
[56:19.880 --> 56:21.880]  the world health organization
[56:21.880 --> 56:23.880]  and the chai comms that have all these level 4
[56:23.880 --> 56:25.880]  bio weapons labs
[56:25.880 --> 56:27.880]  that are developing the very pathogens
[56:27.880 --> 56:29.880]  that now plague humanity
[56:29.880 --> 56:31.880]  life is not imitating art
[56:31.880 --> 56:33.880]  in 2020
[56:33.880 --> 56:35.880]  the Wachowski brothers and many others
[56:35.880 --> 56:37.880]  like chris carter and the ex files
[56:37.880 --> 56:39.880]  were only telegraphing to you
[56:39.880 --> 56:41.880]  what they were experiencing
[56:41.880 --> 56:43.880]  at elite meetings around the world
[56:43.880 --> 56:45.880]  bill joy in 1999
[56:45.880 --> 56:47.880]  one of the co-founders of sun micro systems
[56:47.880 --> 56:49.880]  the major billionaire
[56:49.880 --> 56:51.880]  warned the world in an article titled
[56:51.880 --> 56:53.880]  why the future doesn't need us
[56:53.880 --> 56:55.880]  that he had gone to an elite meeting
[56:55.880 --> 56:57.880]  of top billionaires in sunicon valley
[56:57.880 --> 56:59.880]  and that they had a consensus agreement
[56:59.880 --> 57:01.880]  to bring in world government
[57:01.880 --> 57:03.880]  and exterminate the majority of the world population
[57:03.880 --> 57:05.880]  14 years ago
[57:05.880 --> 57:07.880]  i laid out the globalist plan
[57:07.880 --> 57:09.880]  from their own statements
[57:09.880 --> 57:11.880]  and predicted by the year 2020
[57:11.880 --> 57:13.880]  they would begin executing their depopulation operation
[57:13.880 --> 57:15.880]  this is only the beginning
[57:15.880 --> 57:17.880]  we train you to be locked down
[57:17.880 --> 57:19.880]  so in the future when the really deadly bio weapons
[57:19.880 --> 57:21.880]  are released and billions begin dying
[57:21.880 --> 57:23.880]  you sit there believing governments
[57:23.880 --> 57:25.880]  and corporations are actually your saviour
[57:25.880 --> 57:27.880]  and are going to shepherd you and protect you
[57:27.880 --> 57:29.880]  when in truth they're judas goats
[57:29.880 --> 57:31.880]  leading you into the slaughter
[57:31.880 --> 57:47.880]  i'm alex jones and you have been warned

[58:03.880 --> 58:05.880]  vitamin d

[58:13.880 --> 58:15.880]  this is

[1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:17.880]  that know this is a total fraud
[1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:19.880]  journalist you name it
[1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:21.880]  and that it's a takeover
[1:00:21.880 --> 1:00:23.880]  civilization and they're so scared
[1:00:23.880 --> 1:00:25.880]  they decided just to go along with it
[1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:27.880]  see
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:29.880]  being weak has rewarded people
[1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:31.880]  the last 50 60 years
[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:33.880]  but now we're coming towards the political slaughter
[1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:35.880]  and being weak
[1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:37.880]  and acting like a sheep is going to get your ass destroyed
[1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:39.880]  you know this report i just played
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:41.880]  is so critical it's at
[1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:43.880]  news wars dot com
[1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:45.880]  info wars dot com and bandot video
[1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:47.880]  the only way it reaches the sheeple
[1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:49.880]  with all the proof of who's behind this
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:51.880]  is when you share it
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:53.880]  so again the video is
[1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:55.880]  titled
[1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:57.880]  the for vendetta the corona virus
[1:00:57.880 --> 1:00:59.880]  in game
[1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:01.880]  and if you minimize that for folks on screen
[1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:03.880]  they'll be able to see it right there
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:05.880]  the key to the corona virus secret
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:07.880]  it's on bandot video we built our own system
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:09.880]  be able to get this out to you and your family
[1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:11.880]  if you are the paul reverence get it out now
[1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:13.880]  emergency this is a takeover
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:15.880]  here's rush limbaugh
[1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:17.880]  now of course
[1:01:17.880 --> 1:01:19.880]  we here at the eiv southern
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:21.880]  command are in south florida
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:23.880]  we're in palm beach county
[1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:25.880]  which geographically is a large county
[1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:27.880]  and
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:29.880]  so you would look at the
[1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:31.880]  case data here
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:33.880]  for palm beach a number of cases
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:35.880]  corona virus
[1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:37.880]  a number of deaths
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:39.880]  but one of the things that
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:41.880]  interests me is the hospitalization numbers
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:43.880]  because if you look at drugs
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:45.880]  if you look at the drive by media
[1:01:45.880 --> 1:01:47.880]  you would believe there's not a single hospital
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:49.880]  bed in this country right
[1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:51.880]  you have been led to believe
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:53.880]  that every hospital is overflowing
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:55.880]  that dead bodies are in body bags
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:57.880]  and refrigerated trucks are being
[1:01:57.880 --> 1:01:59.880]  parked off the landfills or whatever
[1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:01.880]  and it's some of the most incredible reporting
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:03.880]  I have seen
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:05.880]  and it is it is in new york
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:07.880]  you know what let's just stop right here
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:09.880]  this is so important I meant to get to this in the other show yesterday
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:11.880]  he said this yesterday by the third fourth hour
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:13.880]  we had it
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:15.880]  I want to come back in the next segment and play the project veritas
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:17.880]  piece and then get to this
[1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:19.880]  and show Oliver Darcy getting project
[1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:21.880]  veritas banned
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:23.880]  of the youtube the videos
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:25.880]  for driving up to the military
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:27.880]  and doctors and nurses
[1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:29.880]  and them saying they think it's overblown
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:31.880]  and Darcy says
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:33.880]  I think this could hurt people
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:35.880]  I don't think that's not true
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:37.880]  doctors and nurses and military don't have voices
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:39.880]  and journalists shouldn't be able
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:41.880]  you can't have citizens talking
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:43.880]  and
[1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:45.880]  youtube went you're right
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:47.880]  because there's an agreement with CNN
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:49.880]  and with media matters that when
[1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:51.880]  they're fact checkers so when they go
[1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:53.880]  to big media
[1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:55.880]  or they go to big tech
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:02:57.880]  and they say I don't want people
[1:02:57.880 --> 1:02:59.880]  talking to doctors that's not awesome
[1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:01.880]  you're right here in the news
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:03.880]  this is the only union
[1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:05.880]  this is unbelievable
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:07.880]  so watching that
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:09.880]  I thought why not back up what rush is saying
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:11.880]  because there are empty hospitals
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:13.880]  and it's way bigger
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:15.880]  than just the apex
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:17.880]  they're all over the country now suddenly empty
[1:03:17.880 --> 1:03:19.880]  and it's because
[1:03:19.880 --> 1:03:21.880]  they told doctors don't do non-essential
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:23.880]  and most of this crap is non-essential
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:25.880]  I mean I
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:27.880]  am around these nouveau rich women
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:29.880]  in Austin
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:31.880]  class areas I can have a gait and all that stuff
[1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:33.880]  I don't like it either I'm going to move the country
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:35.880]  and man these women go to dermatologists
[1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:37.880]  and doctors like five days a week
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:39.880]  they cut them up they slice them up
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:41.880]  they laser beam every mole
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:43.880]  and it's just oh doctors
[1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:45.880]  and it's kind of fun seeing all that shut down
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:47.880]  right now because they don't know what to do
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:49.880]  because that's part of their psychology
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:51.880]  that oh I'm a beautiful woman so
[1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:53.880]  I've got to go and pamper myself
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:55.880]  with constant medical appointments
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:03:57.880]  they always just fry their faces
[1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:59.880]  inject them with crap
[1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:01.880]  just totally screw these women over
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:03.880]  and that's what this is I mean it's a cult
[1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:05.880]  that's scaring everybody
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:07.880]  and it doesn't want anybody questioning it
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:09.880]  and it's got a guy that looks like a
[1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:11.880]  possum that got caught you know
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:13.880]  folks one time
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:15.880]  I was running a shredder
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:17.880]  down by creek bottom
[1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:19.880]  and there was a dead stinking cow there
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:21.880]  and I was supposed to drag the cow
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:23.880]  out of the watering hole
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:25.880]  where the other cows were eating because it might make them sick
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:27.880]  and I got out
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:29.880]  and I went over to the side chain around it
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:31.880]  and I told the story I had this little horse too
[1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:33.880]  that maggots all over it
[1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:35.880]  and I'm dragging it with the chain
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:37.880]  and a possum comes out of it's rear end
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:39.880]  because it likes to go eat the food that's in there
[1:04:39.880 --> 1:04:41.880]  they like to like Darcy you like to eat
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.880]  and feed us crap
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:45.880]  and it comes that possum out with crap all over it
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:47.880]  and I go that looks like Oliver Darcy
[1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:49.880]  just like when I saw the guy from Comedy Central
[1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:51.880]  he looked like Chuck E. Cheese the animatonic rat
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:53.880]  I just suddenly go it's
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:55.880]  um
[1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:57.880]  we're right back
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:04:59.880]  we told you it was coming
[1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:01.880]  we told you that use of virus
[1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:03.880]  to scare everyone into submission
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:05.880]  and set up martial law
[1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:07.880]  and quarantines and lock downs and now it's here
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:09.880]  and I'm here to tell you the rest of the story
[1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:11.880]  three things we all need to do pray to God
[1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:13.880]  for justice and seek his face
[1:05:13.880 --> 1:05:15.880]  and repent
[1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:17.880]  get politically active and wake others up to understand
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:19.880]  this is the world government the castle society
[1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:21.880]  it's all being announced
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:23.880]  prepared yourselves
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:25.880]  and boost your immune systems
[1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:27.880]  and get high quality food
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:29.880]  and we're able to ship storeable food again
[1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:31.880]  our supplier has expanded their factories
[1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:33.880]  and now are able to take new wars
[1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:35.880]  and it's not about this virus folks
[1:05:35.880 --> 1:05:37.880]  that's only the trigger the detonator
[1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:39.880]  it's about what's coming in the future with elections
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:41.880]  may be cancelled with the global
[1:05:41.880 --> 1:05:43.880]  trying to implode the economy
[1:05:43.880 --> 1:05:45.880]  this is just the beginning of the crisis
[1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:47.880]  not the middle and not the end
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:49.880]  so get prepared now while you still can
[1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:51.880]  at m4store.com and please be Paul Ramirez
[1:05:51.880 --> 1:06:19.880]  and spread the word
[1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:21.880]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:23.880]  it is official
[1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:25.880]  the globalist working with
[1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:27.880]  their client superstate
[1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:29.880]  not miss china
[1:06:29.880 --> 1:06:31.880]  launch is sucked up
[1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:37.880]  novel cold virus corona
[1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:39.880]  that's the most common virus out there
[1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:41.880]  most of them are totally harmless
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:43.880]  and we have high levels of zinc and other things
[1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:45.880]  vitamin d it's called record and studies that's very hard to get it
[1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:47.880]  but they don't want you knowing that
[1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:49.880]  great maximum fear and now Fauci
[1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:51.880]  has come out of you just joined us
[1:06:51.880 --> 1:06:53.880]  we're going to play the clip again first here in a moment
[1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:55.880]  and said hey we're going to surveil people
[1:06:55.880 --> 1:06:57.880]  we're going to cycle into other seasons
[1:06:57.880 --> 1:06:59.880]  next year you won't be able to go out either
[1:06:59.880 --> 1:07:01.880]  so they'll run into the middle of summer
[1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:03.880]  and then let you have a month or two
[1:07:03.880 --> 1:07:05.880]  and then clamp it back down but there'll be special apps
[1:07:05.880 --> 1:07:07.880]  they're announcing you'll be tracked
[1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:09.880]  China was the model
[1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:11.880]  they're going to roll it out like they just got these ideas
[1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:13.880]  but it's all pre-planned
[1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:15.880]  by the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:17.880]  they're going to do a lot of other exercises
[1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:19.880]  predicting COVID-19
[1:07:19.880 --> 1:07:21.880]  in November when it was already launched in China
[1:07:21.880 --> 1:07:23.880]  in incubating
[1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:25.880]  and Limbaugh is absolutely right
[1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:27.880]  that there are thousands of videos
[1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:29.880]  we started playing them two weeks ago
[1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.880]  of just empty hospitals everywhere
[1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:33.880]  but now more and more people
[1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:35.880]  from Alabama to Texas to New York
[1:07:35.880 --> 1:07:37.880]  to Wisconsin to Ohio
[1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:39.880]  to Idaho to Montana
[1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:41.880]  to Colorado to California
[1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:43.880]  I mean every state
[1:07:43.880 --> 1:07:45.880]  England it's happening
[1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:47.880]  everywhere they will see
[1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:49.880]  on the news the six o'clock news
[1:07:49.880 --> 1:07:51.880]  that there's long lines people are everywhere
[1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:53.880]  there's people and respirators everyone's dying
[1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:55.880]  here at the hospital
[1:07:55.880 --> 1:07:57.880]  we've been posting videos that are like 30 minutes long
[1:07:57.880 --> 1:07:59.880]  15 minutes long an hour long
[1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:01.880]  every day on Band-Aid video
[1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:03.880]  I mean you can't even watch them all
[1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:05.880]  and these locals
[1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:07.880]  you go to their YouTube channels
[1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:09.880]  it'll be like a auto parts store
[1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:11.880]  or it'll be like a guy that owns a nursery
[1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:13.880]  cleaning supply
[1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:15.880]  it's just normal people or it'll be a retired cop
[1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:17.880]  I mean I'm going and checking their channels
[1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:19.880]  and they have stuff with their kids at the beach
[1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:21.880]  and parties and then suddenly it's all this investigative reporting
[1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:23.880]  and they say
[1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:25.880]  well I live a mile from this hospital
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:27.880]  and they said there's long lines and people dying everywhere
[1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:29.880]  but I noticed they weren't showing a wide shot
[1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:31.880]  and I've seen other videos
[1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:33.880]  and this is a sampling of what they say
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:35.880]  because they are all saying this
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:37.880]  where
[1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:39.880]  they're showing newscasts in Hawaii
[1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.880]  I remember two weeks ago three weeks ago
[1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:43.880]  we first were breaking this
[1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:45.880]  we had to get that Jones fellow, that filmmaker back on
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:47.880]  that's where it all started
[1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:49.880]  and
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:51.880]  he sees them
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:53.880]  on the news
[1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:55.880]  saying that there's long lines
[1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:57.880]  and no one can get in
[1:08:57.880 --> 1:08:59.880]  well he thought he had coronavirus because he'd been sick
[1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:01.880]  he'd just been out of town
[1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:03.880]  in LA at a film show
[1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.880]  he's an award winning filmmaker
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:07.880]  international filmmaker
[1:09:07.880 --> 1:09:09.880]  and the parking lots empty
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:11.880]  he just saw the news an hour before
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:13.880]  and he goes test me
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:15.880]  and they go no we're not going to test you
[1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:17.880]  he parks there for three hours reading a book
[1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:19.880]  and watches I think he said nine people come up
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:21.880]  and they're all turned away
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:23.880]  but he just saw the news so he comes back the next day
[1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:25.880]  and there nobody's there but they're saying it's full
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:27.880]  so everybody started seeing that going
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:29.880]  well they say the hospital is full down the street
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:31.880]  but they need to show it so they drive over
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:33.880]  sometimes ten minutes after
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:35.880]  they say they're live, we're here at the hospital
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.880]  everyone's dying, giant lines, respirators
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:39.880]  help us
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:41.880]  the aliens are attacking we're all dead
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:43.880]  and you get there
[1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:49.880]  and there's nothing crickets crickets crickets crickets crickets crickets
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:51.880]  no one
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:55.880]  so you start asking why is no one here and the hospital goes
[1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:57.880]  we don't know why there's nobody here
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:09:59.880]  I mean some of the hospitals might have
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:01.880]  you know 15 cars in the parking lot that normally has
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:03.880]  a thousand these are huge hospitals
[1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:05.880]  other ones have no one
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:07.880]  and there's hours and hours and hours
[1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:09.880]  in fact I want to ask Kelly McBreen
[1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:11.880]  or one of the crew that's here
[1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:13.880]  go get, go talk to do, he's the one posted these every day
[1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:15.880]  I mean he's probably put together like eight of them
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:17.880]  than I know of and then the fellow we had on
[1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:19.880]  Daria what's the what's the Jones filmmaker's name
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:21.880]  what's his first name we had on three weeks ago
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:27.880]  look it up because I want to tell folks about his video too
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:29.880]  he was the first
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:31.880]  and it just chain reaction
[1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:33.880]  the video got over a million views
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:35.880]  last time I saw it
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:37.880]  chain reaction and then everybody just starts going out
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:39.880]  to see
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:41.880]  what's going on
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:45.880]  E. Michael Jones can we get him back on
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:47.880]  I really want to get him back on thank you
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:49.880]  and let's get him on tomorrow
[1:10:49.880 --> 1:10:51.880]  or get him on the war room let's just get him back on
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:53.880]  because he was just going to be tested
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:55.880]  and thought well there's long lines
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:57.880]  I still better go do it because I feel sick
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:10:59.880]  and he got there
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:01.880]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:03.880]  and there was no one there now it's a chain reaction
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:05.880]  so let's be clear these aren't hospitals
[1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:07.880]  open and waiting for the apex
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:09.880]  for the paramount for the top of the mountain
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:11.880]  for the peak
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:13.880]  this is across
[1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:15.880]  the board they're there saying
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:17.880]  it's full there are people
[1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:19.880]  lined up there are there are people on stretchers
[1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:21.880]  in the hallways
[1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:23.880]  Cuomo we have no respirators
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:25.880]  people are dying right now
[1:11:25.880 --> 1:11:27.880]  so hey there's a stockpile down there
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:29.880]  well I don't want to discuss those
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:33.880]  Jason Jones thanks a lot
[1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:35.880]  I really want him back on
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:37.880]  I really want him back on
[1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:39.880]  Steven Jones is the professor
[1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:41.880]  that exposed explosives in WTC7
[1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:43.880]  and that's why I begged hard
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:45.880]  I want Jason Jones back on
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:47.880]  I want Jason Jones back on
[1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:49.880]  I want Jason Jones back on
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:51.880]  I want Jason Jones back on
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:53.880]  I want Jason Jones back on
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:55.880]  I want Jason Jones back on
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:11:57.880]  I want Jason, I'm not mad
[1:11:57.880 --> 1:11:59.880]  I just want him back on
[1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:01.880]  so back to what I was saying
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:03.880]  back to what I was saying here
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.880]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:13.880]  God watching this country
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:15.880]  totally butchered and just
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:17.880]  how everyone is in a sleep state
[1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:19.880]  and it's like, I'm awake
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:21.880]  and everybody is like in a sleep state
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:26.040]  it's worse and worse. People are mesmerized, ladies and gentlemen. It's
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:29.440]  absolutely out of control. I gotta go to rebrow. I'm not gonna do the show anymore.
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:32.420]  Just screw this whole place and screw everybody. The country's gone. We are a
[1:12:32.420 --> 1:12:36.100]  nation of devil worshiping cowards that have killed 62 million babies, and we
[1:12:36.100 --> 1:12:39.880]  love it. And that's why they're making their move on us, because God is
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:45.940]  removing his protection from the planet. Period. Because you want death and you
[1:12:45.940 --> 1:12:50.200]  want Satanism, you're going to be killed very slowly. They're gonna inject you
[1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:55.880]  with vaccines till you and your family are big, bloated, retarded beast. And
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:59.740]  then they're gonna kill you. And Bill Gates is going to urinate on your grave.
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:03.280]  And he still will do nothing.
[1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:08.940]  Even though I've told you all of this over and over again, even though I've
[1:13:08.940 --> 1:13:14.160]  laid every damn bit of it out. Now, Seattle blow up on air like I used to.
[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:17.800]  I've learned to control myself and channel the energy. And I'm gonna do
[1:13:17.800 --> 1:13:22.800]  that. It's just, you know,
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:33.920]  it's the same problems over and over again that drive me insane. The
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:38.200]  departmentalization of everything. Everything is specialization because
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:41.680]  no one wants to get outside their box. They want to be put in a little cube
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:47.200]  and do one little thing and not be conscious. And I see it everywhere. And
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:52.080]  it's intensifying and you're dying and your spirit is dying. You are being
[1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:57.400]  reduced right now. America and everything our ancestors fought for is
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:14:03.400]  being murdered and people are wiggling around enjoying it like it's fun and
[1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:09.280]  it's cutesy. It's not cute and it's not funny. You understand it is a 100
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:13.640]  percent undebated absolute fact.
[1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:21.400]  That they have never guessed the right flu virus for the mutation of what the
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:24.360]  main flu is the next year. And it's always a whole bunch of flu dozens and
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:28.120]  dozens of them. And then it does nothing to protect you from the next flu. If
[1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:33.960]  it's not the exact flu. That's why they never asked why they don't have a
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:37.640]  vaccine for the common cold because it's too varied because there's thousands
[1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:41.560]  of them and because you have to get it exactly right. And viruses are always
[1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:44.760]  mutating. But you notice they're telling you they've got a vaccine. They want you
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:48.880]  willingly to go take whatever it is that's going to be in there. And when
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:53.840]  major German Italian and other firms have gotten things like H1N1 vaccine and
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:58.720]  scanned it. They go this is super. This is like 10 years ago. Super advanced
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:03.320]  bio engineered thing where the whole bunch of stuff added on to it. And then
[1:15:03.320 --> 1:15:08.560]  they were SWAT team was in the news by the Italian government because the
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:13.440]  manufacturer of the vaccine and the who said that's patented. You're not allowed
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:20.600]  to scan what we put in there. Trojan horses trojan horses are in the cell
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:25.520]  phones. They're in the food. They're in the vaccines. Everything they give you
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:29.640]  is for another thing to control you. It's not so you can sit there and jerk off
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:35.800]  the porn or sit there and you know play Tetris. It's to watch you and fry you
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:39.800]  and surveil you in the future. Be your jail guard to tell you when you can go
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:43.680]  outside. How much food you can have. What profession you have. Whether you can
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:47.840]  have children or not. And you all want to die and you're going to get tortured
[1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:52.040]  to death like those babies. God is putting us into slavery. They're going
[1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:58.880]  to burn in hell. If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs,
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:03.040]  listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:07.240]  you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of
[1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:13.120]  control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:17.600]  before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:22.280]  problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national

[1:19:54.240 --> 1:20:05.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:33.920]  What the left does, they'll sneak around live to stand for, not me. You know, we
[1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:40.320]  deserve everything that's about to happen to us. But our children don't, they
[1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:45.960]  haven't sold out to Satan yet. They have an act like coward jellyfish. By the way, I
[1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:48.680]  wasn't mad at the crew earlier and I wasn't even mad. The listeners, when I'm
[1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:52.320]  saying you're all gonna burn in hell, I mean the people that would rejoice in
[1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:57.540]  killing babies. I mean, I remember just four months ago when suddenly on all the
[1:20:57.540 --> 1:21:01.040]  comedy major shows and all over the news and all the big feminist groups were
[1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:06.000]  like, I love killing babies. I had a baby girl with me and I like to get pregnant
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:09.880]  and then I've done this three times with my boyfriend. We like to have sex while
[1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:13.000]  I'm pregnant. We like to think about the baby. Oh, she's a little girl. That's a
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:16.960]  little boy. And then I go in there and I've got such power. They chopped that
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:21.720]  little piece of trash up and I feel like God when I'm killing that baby. I mean,
[1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:25.320]  I've played those clips. You want me to play them again?
[1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:33.160]  And it's just the weirdness of Cuomo's like this crazy dictator. He's got weird
[1:21:33.160 --> 1:21:37.160]  nipple stud rings and I'm not attacking people. They got nipple stud rings. But
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:42.280]  you know, when dudes got it, I mean, you know, it means they're catching and
[1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:44.680]  pitching and then that means they could just blackmail him. Of course he's
[1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:56.000]  blackmailed. I mean, these people are crazy and it's just a psychotic. We are
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:00.720]  an evil population. We are. We are soft. We are stupid and we're dead. The
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:04.640]  globalists are going to kill us. They're even worse than us, but they embrace
[1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:08.160]  that they are the survival of the fittest and because they're in power. It's
[1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:11.120]  their right to do all this to us and I'm sitting here watching it going. I don't
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:15.640]  want to be part of this. I don't want to join them and be part of exterminating
[1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:25.040]  everybody and then I don't want to join the giant masses of idiots. And I just
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:28.000]  sit there and I look at my children. They're good. They're strong. They love
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.640]  God. They're a little spoiled. They're problems, but they don't deserve all
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:38.520]  this and neither do your children. So I started thinking about hours of video.
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:44.320]  I've watched the last three weeks. Psychoanalyzing now myself and that's
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:53.600]  when I got pissed earlier was that for three weeks, there's footage pouring
[1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:59.400]  into us and pouring in every worse hours a day of people watching newscast and
[1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:05.520]  going to the hospital the same day. Minutes or hours later and there's no
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:11.280]  one there in the middle of the day. It's all lies because the globalists didn't
[1:23:11.280 --> 1:23:15.480]  get their propaganda perfect. It's like because the low levels aren't involved.
[1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:17.720]  They just kind of give them directives and hope they follow suit and hope and
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:20.800]  they over carry it out as Governor Newsom said, we don't need martial law
[1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:23.760]  publics are doing to themselves. He said three weeks ago. He was laughing
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:28.400]  about peer pressure. People being little, you know, police officers that don't
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:36.680]  even have any training. It's not that they're empty for the apex. They didn't
[1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:40.160]  think when they said no, non-essential and most of the healthcare now is
[1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:44.680]  non-essential. It's just people using their insurance and getting into the whole
[1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:49.880]  medical thing. I've gone and had surgeries a few times that I had to have
[1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:54.240]  the last few years, a hernia and torn bicep, things like that. The bicep hurt
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:58.760]  like it was big tear and I was talking to the doctors. Yeah, most of these
[1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:01.560]  people just come in here and get surgeries for each finger to get a
[1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:04.680]  surgery to get pain pills and they're just totally and I was watching these
[1:24:04.680 --> 1:24:08.200]  people while they were putting me under right before they did just getting off
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:13.480]  and like, oh, the shot. Oh, yeah. Oh, when they start getting the first, you know,
[1:24:13.480 --> 1:24:17.200]  injection of the IV and I'm just like, you know, that causes brain damage every
[1:24:17.200 --> 1:24:24.000]  time. I mean, I'm only getting surgery unless I need to. So I mean, my hernia, I
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:27.040]  had it for 10 years. I mean, I had like guts hanging. I had to shove them in
[1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:31.000]  when I was on air like a couple times, you know, per hour. Just I didn't want to
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.600]  have the surgery. I was too busy and he got so bad with the guts hanging. I went
[1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:43.560]  on. Let's get it done. But that's that's what we've turned into. And so I don't
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:46.640]  know, man. I just can't join Satan. I've been around these globalists and
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:52.080]  they're so creepy and so unhappy and the feeling is so bad and so empty, so dark
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:57.600]  that I couldn't join them. But I do get that they trick the general public to be
[1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:02.840]  evil and accept abortion and devil worship. And so the public kind of does
[1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:08.600]  deserve to be exterminated. It's but see the globalists are playing God, though.
[1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:11.800]  They want to carry out the operation of God. They're the ones that help people
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:16.000]  be evil, grease the skids, incentivize it, run the whole thing. But then they
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.160]  want to play God too at the same time and then exterminate everybody. I want to
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:24.240]  promise the globalist something. And I know this just as sure as that sign over
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:30.560]  there on the wall is bright red and says exit. When they make their exit, they
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:33.800]  are going to be imprisoned in a dimension with themselves forever. That's not
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:38.560]  going to be a nice place. The hell of their own making and their system will
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:41.200]  fail. They'll never get their life extension technology the way they want
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:44.760]  it. It's never going to work right. They'll say it works. It will be a fraud
[1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:52.200]  and AI facsimile of who they were. They won't be them. And their new old
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:59.640]  orders going down. But God is going to allow it to come into fruition to kill
[1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:08.480]  like revelation says. Close to half the world population. So hey, all of you
[1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:11.240]  that think social distancing and doing what they say and taking their
[1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:17.080]  inoculations to keep you safe. Good. Take them. You take the shots. Hell, give
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:21.720]  me your kids. Kill your kids too. Kill them slow. You're scum. Your kids are
[1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:25.200]  probably scum too. So I'm just going to kind of get in the middle, I guess. I'm
[1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:28.760]  going to be the globalist, but I'm going to start saying, hey, you want to kill
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:33.320]  yourselves, you go do it. But oh, don't try to make me take your shots and don't
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:37.160]  try to make me eat your GMO and don't try to make me submit to you and go, oh,
[1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:41.360]  I'm sick because you didn't take the vaccine. No dumbass. If you supposedly
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:43.400]  took the vaccine, you shouldn't get it.
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:50.200]  Now I'm going to be a good boy and get out of this nasty mood here. But like
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:53.080]  Limbaugh said yesterday, if he told people what he really thinks, he'd be off
[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:57.200]  the air because he's it's controlled. He, you know, the network will shut him
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:01.640]  down. I run my own network and the stations that carry us are their own
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:05.440]  people. And that's why we're on the air and we appreciate it. But putting
[1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:09.200]  the perfume on this pig, it ain't going to fix a damn thing.
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:15.320]  And it's all here. And I saw that Fauci statement and all the other stuff and I
[1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:19.600]  knew it was coming forced inoculations. We're never going to stop the clamp
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:22.440]  down. It's just going to be on and off on and off. Well, if you've got that in
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:27.400]  place, that's a clamp down, you know, like jail cells open up and let folks be in
[1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:30.520]  general population at night. They close, but you're still in a prison.
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:36.360]  This is the most classical form of globalist takeover. We predict it would
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:41.000]  happen. They had other options, big wars, financial collapses, race wars. But the
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:49.600]  big enchilada or enchilada, like they'd say in New York City is this. And this is
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:54.360]  the classic real McCoy, what we expected, the exact big dog they'd send, not the
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:57.920]  virus itself, but this attack. This is it. This is a primary main assault, their
[1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:02.000]  best probability of success. It's the one I'd launched, one I predicted. Got a
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:05.560]  video on info wars.com 15 times. I predicted just this and folks, I don't
[1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:08.680]  sit there and say that to go, Oh man, wow, Alex, how the hell do you know this?
[1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:14.360]  I'm gonna tell you again, these creeps think you're an idiot. And so they brag
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:18.000]  about it and got the whole damn thing teed up. Bill Gates can't shut his mouth.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.800]  How he wants to kill you and your family and kill old people to depopulate.
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:26.560]  And again, you've done nothing about it on average. I'm gonna talk about the
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:31.480]  audience. I'm not new listeners. You think this is all funny? Well, let me tell
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:36.160]  all the buzzfeed New York Times folks out there. They get their plan. The force
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:39.960]  inoculation start. Most of you in 10 years are gonna die of cancer, but not
[1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:43.960]  before they cut your ass up and feed you bug poison and radiate your ass and
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  take every damn dime out of you. Remember when you're dying, you're taking
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:51.720]  your last breaths. You remember Alex Jones warned you understand? Because
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:54.180]  that's how God works. He sends people to warn your ass first.
[1:28:54.180 --> 1:29:00.180]  Hello, patriots. My name is Todd Savage, founder of black rifle real estate
[1:29:00.220 --> 1:29:04.380]  dot com. Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one
[1:29:04.380 --> 1:29:07.700]  day I chose to leave my family to freedom. Today we live on a sustainable
[1:29:07.700 --> 1:29:11.660]  20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool our children
[1:29:11.740 --> 1:29:14.940]  without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us. If you're ready to
[1:29:14.940 --> 1:29:18.700]  flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our black rifle real estate
[1:29:18.700 --> 1:29:22.340]  team is here to help go to black rifle real estate dot com. That's black
[1:29:22.340 --> 1:29:28.940]  rifle real estate dot com. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon
[1:29:28.980 --> 1:29:33.640]  you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're not a live
[1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:38.000]  underground gopher. You need survivalist camps. The ultimate fully functional
[1:29:38.020 --> 1:29:41.340]  off the grid mobile survival bug outhouse that's well equipped and
[1:29:41.340 --> 1:29:46.460]  custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer bold statement. You bet. See
[1:29:46.460 --> 1:29:51.420]  him now at survivalist camps dot com. That's survivalist camps dot com. Trust
[1:29:51.420 --> 1:29:54.380]  your family survival to survivalist camps dot com.
[1:29:57.020 --> 1:30:02.820]  The ultimate charity would be a nanny state that would not allow anyone to
[1:30:02.820 --> 1:30:07.300]  ever do anything that could possibly hurt them. And that's the globalist plan.
[1:30:07.540 --> 1:30:12.180]  And now Mr Fauci at the NIH last night in the press conference standing right
[1:30:12.180 --> 1:30:16.580]  next to president said, we're gonna have a global lockdown because he talked
[1:30:16.580 --> 1:30:23.380]  world leaders until not one more person is dying or one more person is
[1:30:23.380 --> 1:30:27.820]  infected. The video is posted on info wars dot com. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:30:27.820 --> 1:30:32.340]  that sets the precedent where not one person can die from the flu. Not one
[1:30:32.340 --> 1:30:36.460]  person can die from a cold. Everyone will be surveilled in lifetime by their
[1:30:36.460 --> 1:30:41.860]  cell phones and apps and drones and an absolute straight jacket of pure
[1:30:41.980 --> 1:30:45.620]  medical tyranny. And remember, it's a big farmer that has a little before
[1:30:45.620 --> 1:30:49.860]  by the weapons labs that keeps leaking all these man made viruses. They're
[1:30:49.860 --> 1:30:53.460]  holding us all hostage. Oh, and he talked about forced
[1:30:53.460 --> 1:30:55.820]  denotations.
[1:30:58.060 --> 1:31:03.620]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement. We are selling out of all
[1:31:03.620 --> 1:31:07.500]  of our high quality iodine products and in four store dot com. The super blue

[1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:30.420]  amazing it is just in general everyday life, not even during these insane

[1:31:56.340 --> 1:32:01.780]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key. Sure,
[1:32:01.780 --> 1:32:06.540]  coffee, candy and other highly sugar filled drinks can give you a short boost.
[1:32:06.540 --> 1:32:13.020]  But the crash always follows. That's why we created a mixable energy formula to
[1:32:13.020 --> 1:32:18.020]  take on the go when you need a little help. Turbo force similar to other mix
[1:32:18.020 --> 1:32:23.820]  in energy packets. Turbo force from info wars life utilizes vitamins, amino
[1:32:23.820 --> 1:32:29.500]  acids and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide
[1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:34.580]  focus, clarity and a boost of energy when you need it. Turbo force is
[1:32:34.580 --> 1:32:39.740]  certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable and tasty
[1:32:39.740 --> 1:32:44.620]  energy. And speaking of affordable, you can even try turbo force for a limited
[1:32:44.620 --> 1:32:50.660]  time at an incredible 40% off. Don't wait till it's out of stock again and
[1:32:50.660 --> 1:32:56.060]  get turbo force right now only at info wars store dot com.
[1:32:56.060 --> 1:33:02.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:16.260 --> 1:33:22.380]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you from the front
[1:33:22.380 --> 1:33:31.260]  line of the info war. President Trump is being railroaded by total hysteria and
[1:33:31.260 --> 1:33:38.180]  by the fact that the American people have bent over and begged to be mounted
[1:33:38.180 --> 1:33:39.060]  by the globalist.
[1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:43.380]  Spider.
[1:33:45.580 --> 1:33:49.020]  He came out eight weeks ago and said we're a strong nation. We can handle
[1:33:49.020 --> 1:33:53.060]  this 30 something thousand down here in the flu. We'll try to mitigate it, but
[1:33:53.060 --> 1:33:56.100]  we're going to stay open. We're not going to be fearful. And the media was
[1:33:56.100 --> 1:33:59.260]  like, you're going to get everybody killed. It's your problem. It's bad. He
[1:33:59.260 --> 1:34:02.020]  goes, well, wait, Pelosi says stay open. The Democrats say stay open.
[1:34:04.380 --> 1:34:10.020]  And so he backed off and started saying, okay, we'll clamp down. And now
[1:34:10.020 --> 1:34:14.340]  they're like, you're doing good Trump. And oh, Jim Acosta is like, Trump gets
[1:34:14.340 --> 1:34:21.060]  it now. We have to stay on lockdown forever in cycles. And now Trump and
[1:34:21.060 --> 1:34:24.940]  good cost to our friends because Jeff Zucker's like, okay, Trump's doing we
[1:34:24.940 --> 1:34:28.140]  want to start being nice to him because the public doesn't have a memory on
[1:34:28.140 --> 1:34:31.380]  average. That's what they count on the globalist level. And so they know they
[1:34:31.380 --> 1:34:34.780]  get that depression that's coming in a month or two. They keep this going for
[1:34:34.780 --> 1:34:39.380]  sure. All the numbers show it. The irrevocable shutdown to start something
[1:34:39.380 --> 1:34:45.700]  this big up. You just can't do that. Well, ladies and gentlemen, then they'll
[1:34:45.700 --> 1:34:48.340]  turn around and blame Trump for that as they're already preparing to do.
[1:34:49.940 --> 1:34:54.980]  Mr. Schiff over at the House Intelligence Committee is starting his
[1:34:54.980 --> 1:34:59.260]  investigation like a 9 11 commission into whose fault it is. And of course,
[1:34:59.260 --> 1:35:04.420]  Trump is the main person they're looking at. And so now you see where it's
[1:35:04.420 --> 1:35:09.580]  all going. So I told Trump and so did Mike Adams. Hey, you at least got to say
[1:35:09.580 --> 1:35:12.620]  it serious. We're going to deal with it. Don't just say it's not a problem. It's
[1:35:12.620 --> 1:35:15.860]  like the flu. They're going to get you. Well, Trump started doing that. Then
[1:35:15.860 --> 1:35:21.380]  they gave him brownie points, but you but the next traps already set. So
[1:35:21.380 --> 1:35:24.940]  that's what's happening. You know, I have Gia Burr Griffin joining us. I
[1:35:24.940 --> 1:35:27.420]  should have said that I wanted to get him on a few days ago when I saw that
[1:35:27.420 --> 1:35:31.900]  Trump basically started nationalizing the Federal Reserve parts of it. And it
[1:35:31.900 --> 1:35:34.580]  is true. He began to nationalize the Federal Reserve. That should be under
[1:35:34.580 --> 1:35:40.140]  the power of Congress. Not the private Federal Reserve will play clips of the
[1:35:40.140 --> 1:35:43.300]  old head of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan saying the Fed is above the
[1:35:43.300 --> 1:35:46.300]  law and all the rest of it to understand what this is really all about on the
[1:35:46.300 --> 1:35:51.260]  monetary front. And then tomorrow, only having one guest on Jason Jones at
[1:35:51.260 --> 1:35:54.300]  first exposed the empty hospitals and clinics and testing facilities that's
[1:35:54.300 --> 1:35:56.100]  now taken the country and the world by storm.
[1:35:56.100 --> 1:36:03.260]  And I'll be here Friday and we're gonna do a special Saturday show as we did a
[1:36:03.260 --> 1:36:06.980]  few weeks ago. And as we've been doing off and on from two to four, maybe even
[1:36:06.980 --> 1:36:11.460]  longer live. It's on the radio and TV satellites, but only has breaks for
[1:36:11.460 --> 1:36:14.900]  local stations. We're pulling our network breaks so that we have more time
[1:36:14.900 --> 1:36:18.500]  each hour, only about six, seven minutes of ads, putting on the clock to the
[1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:21.300]  14 minutes an hour, watch some special guests and always have the Sunday
[1:36:21.300 --> 1:36:24.620]  show. I've been doing that 12 years now, four to six p.m. as well, not just the
[1:36:24.620 --> 1:36:27.820]  weekday show we've been doing in this slot for 22 years, this time for 23
[1:36:27.820 --> 1:36:32.980]  years, and then 26 years total on air. So I overheated earlier. That's an old
[1:36:32.980 --> 1:36:39.460]  Alex Jones trade to blow up. It was 100% real. And it's because I have been
[1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:43.900]  really upset about what's going on because it's all a formula. It's all a
[1:36:43.900 --> 1:36:48.740]  program. It's all an operation by the multinational corporations, the WHO
[1:36:48.740 --> 1:36:54.060]  and the China. It's not the China orders the who around China in 49 signed on
[1:36:54.060 --> 1:36:58.140]  with the Rockefellers in the globalist operation to set this up as the model
[1:36:58.140 --> 1:37:06.140]  state to do this. And Trump represents a nationalist arm that's trying to take
[1:37:06.140 --> 1:37:10.060]  American power back from the globalist so that America runs the global
[1:37:10.060 --> 1:37:13.420]  system and not China. It's really a fight over who runs the global government
[1:37:13.420 --> 1:37:16.980]  right now, not even over getting rid of global government. Let's be completely
[1:37:16.980 --> 1:37:21.060]  honest. I'll have America run it so we can make it more libertarian, more
[1:37:21.060 --> 1:37:24.980]  Americana with influence getting patriots and national and selected
[1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:31.660]  everywhere operation 1776 worldwide that I launched about 15 years ago. And then
[1:37:31.660 --> 1:37:38.660]  we can defeat the Malthusian eugenics based globalist program. And that's why
[1:37:38.660 --> 1:37:41.780]  now the globalists are so pissed as they can see that that common sense
[1:37:41.780 --> 1:37:45.940]  approach has been picked up by Intelligencia and the intelligence agencies
[1:37:45.940 --> 1:37:49.060]  and others that do not want to carry out a homicidal post human world
[1:37:49.060 --> 1:37:52.700]  government system. Let me introduce a couple terms to you here that are that
[1:37:52.700 --> 1:37:59.940]  are key. I'll get to the nose. You have BC before Christ. You have 80 after
[1:37:59.940 --> 1:38:08.260]  death. Now they have the common era. And before the common era, that's the
[1:38:08.260 --> 1:38:12.220]  modernist thing to get rid of Christ. Even though that's the historical fact
[1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:20.820]  because asked Congressman Crenshaw, the gay pirate. He said Jesus was an
[1:38:20.820 --> 1:38:28.260]  imaginary person like a superhero. No, the Roman and Jewish histories report
[1:38:28.260 --> 1:38:32.020]  Jesus and the basic things that happen. You know, they'll tell you someday
[1:38:32.020 --> 1:38:36.580]  that George Washington didn't exist. By the way, you know, in Travis County,
[1:38:36.580 --> 1:38:43.700]  60% of births are our Caesarean section. They popular by the surgery on
[1:38:43.700 --> 1:38:52.660]  Cleopatra. Interesting to know history, just basic stuff. I predicted 20 years
[1:38:52.660 --> 1:38:57.660]  ago that one day they will take children from mothers that try to have
[1:38:57.660 --> 1:39:01.180]  babies at home and try to have them vaginally, even though statistically
[1:39:01.180 --> 1:39:03.940]  the babies are much healthier. They are vaginally possible to get more money
[1:39:03.940 --> 1:39:07.260]  than the Caesarean. They can run it through quicker. And of course, now
[1:39:07.260 --> 1:39:10.580]  that's happened. There's moves to make by the whole medical
[1:39:10.580 --> 1:39:15.060]  tyranny to make vaginal birth prohibited. And they always want to keep
[1:39:15.060 --> 1:39:17.380]  the baby away for a day so the mother doesn't ever produce milk to get them
[1:39:17.380 --> 1:39:21.420]  on that formula. You get about a third smaller brain, about an IQ 30 points
[1:39:21.420 --> 1:39:29.300]  lower than the floor. I just does this trick. Yeah, not me. I got I walked
[1:39:29.300 --> 1:39:34.020]  with my mom and target when I was 18 months old. I tugged on her skirt and I
[1:39:34.020 --> 1:39:38.500]  said, mama, kitty. And then she said, no, no, no, when we hit the car and I
[1:39:38.500 --> 1:39:41.980]  kicked her in the leg, which I never did. I was a nice little boy. She said,
[1:39:41.980 --> 1:39:47.100]  that's it, you're weaned. But see that big brain, that big head, those big bones
[1:39:47.100 --> 1:39:54.420]  from the milk my mother produced. But see soon it'll be a conspiracy theory
[1:39:54.420 --> 1:39:59.540]  that women's breast ever even were for milk. I'm not joking. They're saying
[1:39:59.540 --> 1:40:03.820]  you can't say mother and father. They're saying that men can have babies.
[1:40:03.820 --> 1:40:08.260]  They're assaulting the very fabric of reality.
[1:40:18.380 --> 1:40:23.820]  No biving boards, no dodgeball, no tag, no football. They already phase most
[1:40:23.820 --> 1:40:28.420]  of the sin. No contact sports. No one's allowed to drive their cars. They're
[1:40:28.420 --> 1:40:32.420]  gonna show the robot cars are safer. It just saves one person while we lose
[1:40:32.420 --> 1:40:35.700]  50,000 year on the road. Well, the robots, we got it down in this town that did
[1:40:35.700 --> 1:40:39.820]  it by 50%. Well, okay, you can't drive your car now. This is their admitted
[1:40:39.820 --> 1:40:44.740]  plan. So I'm gonna come back, cover the news as good as you ever grifted. And
[1:40:44.740 --> 1:40:57.380]  then I'll get to the limbo stuff and the veritas and the possum all over Darcy.
[1:40:57.380 --> 1:41:11.740]  But you need to know this term. After the human error. A H E after the human
[1:41:11.740 --> 1:41:17.420]  era. By the way, that is what we're entering. The end of the human era, the
[1:41:17.420 --> 1:41:25.420]  post human point of term here that will you will hear about after the human
[1:41:25.460 --> 1:41:32.740]  era. And the great ones that innovated and cause the new transition into this
[1:41:32.900 --> 1:41:33.460]  thing.
[1:41:36.860 --> 1:41:40.980]  But before they kill and destroy us all, our humanity already has to be
[1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:45.980]  destroyed to remain the image of God. We must give that humanity up slowly. And
[1:41:45.980 --> 1:41:48.780]  then the truth is, Satan never had the power to take our humanity, just like
[1:41:48.780 --> 1:41:53.020]  Faust. Faust died thinking Satan still had power over him. He could have denounced
[1:41:53.020 --> 1:42:02.420]  Satan in praise Christ and could have been delivered, but he didn't. So you
[1:42:02.420 --> 1:42:08.420]  need to repent. I'm repenting. And I know exactly how they're gonna roll the
[1:42:08.420 --> 1:42:12.020]  whole thing out. That's that's what's horrible. Now I'm having to really look
[1:42:12.020 --> 1:42:19.860]  into the research we've done and what I've already know. And I'm having to look
[1:42:19.860 --> 1:42:22.540]  at the next phases and how they're gonna roll it out and what they're gonna do.
[1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:29.140]  It's terrible. I see it about five years from now and there'll be some new
[1:42:29.140 --> 1:42:32.180]  plague out. They're not going to stop. This is so successful. It's gonna be
[1:42:32.180 --> 1:42:35.860]  every year now, but there'll be groups protesting and coming out in mass and
[1:42:35.860 --> 1:42:41.900]  they're gonna release really deadly bio weapons, but are only meant to mutate
[1:42:41.900 --> 1:42:45.060]  once and then become harmless. And they're gonna go then spray crowds with
[1:42:45.060 --> 1:42:49.980]  stuff that kills them in like three days with possum blood squirting out. And
[1:42:49.980 --> 1:42:54.220]  then everyone's just gonna totally panic and just absolutely beg to be put
[1:42:54.220 --> 1:43:16.500]  to present.
[1:43:24.220 --> 1:43:27.140]  has been spreading the word that the Forbidden Truth lives
[1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:30.100]  at infowars.com forward slash show in the end of our video
[1:43:30.100 --> 1:43:32.220]  and it's growing exponentially
[1:43:32.220 --> 1:43:35.060]  and they attempt to censor only backfiring.
[1:43:35.060 --> 1:43:37.740]  But we can supercharge this right now.
[1:43:37.740 --> 1:43:39.180]  If all of you listening realize,
[1:43:39.180 --> 1:43:41.340]  hey, you know how to find the show,
[1:43:41.340 --> 1:43:43.020]  but other people don't.
[1:43:43.020 --> 1:43:45.180]  They believe mainstream media that was off the air
[1:43:45.180 --> 1:43:47.860]  so you can override the corporate media,
[1:43:47.860 --> 1:43:50.260]  the establishment, all of them at this critical time
[1:43:50.260 --> 1:43:53.140]  and tell folks that the truth lives and is back on air.
[1:43:53.140 --> 1:43:55.340]  infowars.com.
[1:43:55.340 --> 1:43:59.100]  We knew early on that COVID-19 was an engineered bio-weapon.
[1:43:59.100 --> 1:44:00.500]  But again, people say,
[1:44:00.500 --> 1:44:02.060]  oh, then it must be the most deadly thing ever.
[1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:05.380]  No, it does currently kill people.
[1:44:05.380 --> 1:44:07.540]  But if you're gonna release a bio-weapon for fear
[1:44:07.540 --> 1:44:10.380]  and to bankrupt an economy and cause panic
[1:44:10.380 --> 1:44:12.380]  and to run folks off the edge of a cliff
[1:44:12.380 --> 1:44:14.260]  and a giant artificial stampede,
[1:44:14.260 --> 1:44:16.180]  you wanna know the real trajectory.
[1:44:16.180 --> 1:44:18.860]  Kill a bunch of old people, kill people that are deficient,
[1:44:18.860 --> 1:44:20.580]  kill people that are already sick,
[1:44:20.580 --> 1:44:23.340]  get rid of folks the globalists don't even want anyways,
[1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:24.620]  but scare everybody else
[1:44:24.620 --> 1:44:28.420]  who you wanna control into submission.
[1:44:28.420 --> 1:44:29.340]  And that's what's going on.
[1:44:29.340 --> 1:44:31.260]  So people get confused by the paradox of,
[1:44:31.260 --> 1:44:33.060]  you say it's a real virus, you say it's serious,
[1:44:33.060 --> 1:44:35.740]  but you say don't panic and don't shut the economy down.
[1:44:35.740 --> 1:44:37.700]  Exactly, because if you do that,
[1:44:37.700 --> 1:44:40.020]  they're gonna keep releasing bio-weapons over and over again
[1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:43.420]  because it works so well on the public.
[1:44:43.420 --> 1:44:45.260]  Most people are starting to wake up,
[1:44:45.260 --> 1:44:48.500]  but we have to understand that pressures being put on Trump
[1:44:48.500 --> 1:44:51.060]  to basically keep the economy shut for other six months
[1:44:51.060 --> 1:44:53.740]  to a year will be a depression long before then.
[1:44:53.740 --> 1:44:55.140]  We've gotta go back to work.
[1:44:56.300 --> 1:44:59.180]  The virus and all of the hype
[1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:03.980]  is designed to destroy one thing, confidence.
[1:45:03.980 --> 1:45:07.660]  It's confidence in an economy, confidence in a culture,
[1:45:07.660 --> 1:45:10.820]  confidence in the direction of the civilization
[1:45:10.820 --> 1:45:14.580]  and the people are going that causes people to work hard
[1:45:14.580 --> 1:45:18.100]  and believe in the future and invest its spirit
[1:45:18.100 --> 1:45:20.500]  and the entire media and the entire culture
[1:45:20.500 --> 1:45:22.020]  and all these multinational governments
[1:45:22.020 --> 1:45:25.020]  and the UN, the WHO and the Chai comms in Hollywood
[1:45:25.020 --> 1:45:29.660]  have been having orgasmic delight
[1:45:29.660 --> 1:45:34.660]  over how pliantly everyone has gotten into a state of fear.
[1:45:34.900 --> 1:45:36.420]  Yes, the virus is real.
[1:45:36.420 --> 1:45:38.940]  It's gonna be maybe double what the flu is normally
[1:45:38.940 --> 1:45:41.780]  and it's a bio-weapon, but a bio-weapon,
[1:45:41.780 --> 1:45:44.060]  the globalists do the trajectory of,
[1:45:44.060 --> 1:45:48.060]  but its real target is confidence in the economy.
[1:45:48.060 --> 1:45:50.580]  And that's why recognizing that it's an attempt
[1:45:50.580 --> 1:45:52.780]  to scare us in a submission is critical
[1:45:52.780 --> 1:45:55.700]  because then people will understand the real paradigm.
[1:45:58.180 --> 1:46:00.500]  And I'm here to tell you, I don't need you to thank me
[1:46:00.500 --> 1:46:01.820]  and tell me I've done a good job.
[1:46:01.820 --> 1:46:04.420]  I've done nothing but my duty.
[1:46:04.420 --> 1:46:07.020]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum
[1:46:07.020 --> 1:46:08.900]  coming after innocent people
[1:46:08.900 --> 1:46:11.780]  and I've been fighting them for 13 years
[1:46:11.780 --> 1:46:15.220]  and I'll never stop while I'm growing brave.
[1:46:15.220 --> 1:46:18.980]  For 26 years, Alex Jones and Info Wars
[1:46:18.980 --> 1:46:23.220]  have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide,
[1:46:23.220 --> 1:46:26.820]  waking people up to the new world order,
[1:46:26.820 --> 1:46:31.300]  Bohemian Grove, the American deep state,
[1:46:31.300 --> 1:46:33.860]  the rise of communist China,
[1:46:33.860 --> 1:46:37.180]  the plan for global depopulation,
[1:46:37.180 --> 1:46:41.100]  and global elite pedophiles who pray off of our young.
[1:46:42.180 --> 1:46:44.820]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us,
[1:46:44.820 --> 1:46:48.580]  but because of your support, our fight continues.
[1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:51.460]  Join us, support the Info War,
[1:46:51.460 --> 1:46:54.340]  and together, we will slay the dragon.
[1:46:54.340 --> 1:46:56.300]  Keep fighting Alex, you're the gladiator.
[1:46:59.300 --> 1:47:02.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:07.660 --> 1:47:13.140]  I wanna fly like an eagle back to the country
[1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:15.940]  that's the land of the free, the home of the brave.
[1:47:15.940 --> 1:47:20.940]  It's 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:22.300 --> 1:47:25.220]  The slime flu vaccine in the 1970s
[1:47:25.220 --> 1:47:26.740]  killed more than 10,000 people.
[1:47:26.740 --> 1:47:28.140]  They don't deny it, did they?
[1:47:30.500 --> 1:47:32.500]  They report that the Spanish flu
[1:47:32.500 --> 1:47:34.940]  killed between 30 to 50 million people.
[1:47:34.940 --> 1:47:35.980]  At the end of World War I,
[1:47:35.980 --> 1:47:37.540]  no one really knows the true numbers.
[1:47:37.540 --> 1:47:40.140]  People were run down, they were starving to death.
[1:47:40.140 --> 1:47:41.540]  There were soldiers that were run down
[1:47:41.540 --> 1:47:43.020]  with their ribs sticking out, brought it back.
[1:47:43.020 --> 1:47:46.260]  80, they had massive deficiencies in vitamin D,
[1:47:46.260 --> 1:47:48.620]  zinc, and all the rest of it.
[1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:49.900]  That's just historical fact.
[1:47:52.340 --> 1:47:54.340]  If 100,000 people die from this,
[1:47:54.340 --> 1:47:56.060]  it'll be a bad flu season.
[1:47:56.060 --> 1:48:01.060]  80,000 died in 2018, the US court and the CDC.
[1:48:02.140 --> 1:48:04.500]  And almost all of them were above the age of 80.
[1:48:04.500 --> 1:48:07.580]  They had kidney failure, they had had limbs amputated,
[1:48:07.580 --> 1:48:09.300]  they were diabetic.
[1:48:09.300 --> 1:48:11.620]  Now it's news that, oh, a lot of really old people
[1:48:11.620 --> 1:48:13.140]  and folks with heart failure are dying.
[1:48:13.140 --> 1:48:13.980]  Yeah!
[1:48:16.380 --> 1:48:18.500]  But it also kills some healthy men
[1:48:18.500 --> 1:48:19.900]  and it eats your testicles.
[1:48:19.900 --> 1:48:21.420]  It's not a good thing.
[1:48:21.420 --> 1:48:23.220]  But the point is, is that the idea
[1:48:23.220 --> 1:48:25.260]  that you could never leave your house again
[1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:28.260]  if anyone's dying, and the governor of Texas,
[1:48:28.260 --> 1:48:30.020]  I told you, would go ahead and do it.
[1:48:30.020 --> 1:48:32.620]  He stayed at home ordered for the whole state yesterday.
[1:48:36.300 --> 1:48:37.700]  This is not constitutional.
[1:48:37.700 --> 1:48:40.900]  Now, if we had airborne Ebola,
[1:48:42.540 --> 1:48:44.300]  that was killing 90% of people,
[1:48:44.300 --> 1:48:45.300]  you better have horrible food,
[1:48:45.300 --> 1:48:47.500]  you better be ready to just stay in your house.
[1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:49.580]  And then only essential workers
[1:48:49.580 --> 1:48:50.780]  that work at nuclear power plants
[1:48:50.780 --> 1:48:52.460]  and power plants in the truck drivers
[1:48:52.460 --> 1:48:53.420]  that are getting that stuff.
[1:48:53.420 --> 1:48:55.140]  I mean, you'd wanna stay there.
[1:48:55.140 --> 1:48:56.700]  This isn't even killing 1%.
[1:48:56.700 --> 1:48:59.420]  I'm not saying that's still in the problem.
[1:48:59.420 --> 1:49:00.980]  That's somebody dead in your neighborhood.
[1:49:00.980 --> 1:49:04.300]  But the idea that government can control this
[1:49:04.300 --> 1:49:07.340]  and the idea that vaccines are the solution,
[1:49:07.340 --> 1:49:10.020]  why they never have a vaccine for the common cold.
[1:49:12.500 --> 1:49:15.260]  Because there's thousands of viruses that cause it.
[1:49:15.260 --> 1:49:17.540]  And there's hundreds and hundreds of mutations
[1:49:17.540 --> 1:49:20.140]  of coronaviruses ever here, the main cold bug.
[1:49:21.660 --> 1:49:23.740]  We always knew the ultimate bio weapon
[1:49:23.740 --> 1:49:27.780]  would be a reinfecting cold bug carrying other attacks.
[1:49:27.780 --> 1:49:29.300]  And now they've done it.
[1:49:29.300 --> 1:49:31.340]  An airborne cold virus.
[1:49:32.780 --> 1:49:34.620]  Coronaviruses are piss hands, folks.
[1:49:35.740 --> 1:49:36.660]  But if you run down,
[1:49:36.660 --> 1:49:38.100]  bunch of them get replicating your lungs,
[1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:39.460]  they can kill you.
[1:49:39.460 --> 1:49:41.020]  And like dumping water in your lungs.
[1:49:41.020 --> 1:49:45.060]  Water's nice for nice drink of orange flavored LaCroix.
[1:49:48.060 --> 1:49:51.620]  But you dump a couple cans of this down your lungs, you die.
[1:49:51.620 --> 1:49:54.820]  Goes down your esophagus into your stomach, it's good.
[1:49:54.820 --> 1:49:55.860]  Not in your lungs.
[1:49:59.620 --> 1:50:03.460]  But it's the airborne nature and now it's 27 feet.
[1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:05.460]  Now they're going, well, actually it might go further.
[1:50:05.460 --> 1:50:07.940]  Well, then, oh, oh, oh, see it's,
[1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:09.300]  and it's all over the world.
[1:50:09.300 --> 1:50:12.780]  China starts with incremental, then it closes the net.
[1:50:12.780 --> 1:50:14.780]  And here it's the same thing.
[1:50:14.780 --> 1:50:16.780]  Texas is like, we're not gonna do that.
[1:50:16.780 --> 1:50:18.580]  Even though they had projections of 200,000,
[1:50:18.580 --> 1:50:20.500]  we're gonna die two weeks ago.
[1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:23.500]  Now it's the same projections, but well, I guess we better.
[1:50:24.420 --> 1:50:26.580]  Because it's the corporate pressure
[1:50:26.580 --> 1:50:27.940]  and Trump's getting the praise.
[1:50:27.940 --> 1:50:30.140]  He's never gotten from the media, suddenly.
[1:50:32.300 --> 1:50:33.300]  He's riding a tiger.
[1:50:33.300 --> 1:50:37.580]  We are the problem because we're buying into the fear
[1:50:37.580 --> 1:50:38.740]  and going along with it.
[1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:42.940]  And so the politicians follow where the people go
[1:50:42.940 --> 1:50:44.940]  when we take ashes, why they can't get our guns
[1:50:44.940 --> 1:50:46.020]  because we say no.
[1:50:46.980 --> 1:50:49.260]  It's why they're reversing abortion all over the country.
[1:50:49.260 --> 1:50:50.460]  We're waking up and saying no.
[1:50:50.460 --> 1:50:52.300]  Actually, we're coming back to God
[1:50:52.300 --> 1:50:53.900]  and there's been a revival.
[1:50:53.900 --> 1:50:55.260]  And globalism's in trouble
[1:50:55.260 --> 1:50:57.460]  and humanity's starting to do the right thing.
[1:50:57.460 --> 1:50:59.980]  Look at these headlines.
[1:50:59.980 --> 1:51:01.620]  I mean, there's just hundreds of them here.
[1:51:03.780 --> 1:51:06.500]  Half of humanity is under lockdown.
[1:51:07.500 --> 1:51:12.500]  Dims delay presidential convention by one month
[1:51:13.020 --> 1:51:14.340]  to August 17th.
[1:51:15.740 --> 1:51:18.180]  Texas town clamps down, wear a mask in public
[1:51:18.180 --> 1:51:19.700]  or face fines, arrest.
[1:51:20.700 --> 1:51:22.580]  Total control, just like Islam.
[1:51:23.580 --> 1:51:24.780]  They say, you know,
[1:51:24.780 --> 1:51:27.580]  a man might rape you if you don't wear a beekeeper suit.
[1:51:27.580 --> 1:51:29.060]  Well, then you get arrested if you don't.
[1:51:29.060 --> 1:51:30.540]  Well, now it's a virus might get you.
[1:51:30.540 --> 1:51:31.700]  See, it's how it works.
[1:51:32.540 --> 1:51:34.580]  US jobless claims surge to record 10 million.
[1:51:34.580 --> 1:51:36.500]  I mean, coronavirus lockdown.
[1:51:36.500 --> 1:51:38.900]  Medical teams raise alarm for extra risks
[1:51:38.900 --> 1:51:40.380]  faced by diabetics.
[1:51:41.340 --> 1:51:42.180]  It's happening.
[1:51:42.180 --> 1:51:44.500]  Military going after deep states, cartel, piggy bank.
[1:51:44.500 --> 1:51:46.460]  Trump always said he wanted to put the military
[1:51:46.460 --> 1:51:48.380]  in the ocean and on the borders to shut down
[1:51:48.380 --> 1:51:49.220]  the drug cartels.
[1:51:49.220 --> 1:51:50.060]  Let me give you a little hint.
[1:51:50.060 --> 1:51:51.260]  They've already been doing it.
[1:51:51.260 --> 1:51:52.260]  And so absolutely,
[1:51:52.260 --> 1:51:54.940]  one of the by land who is by sea,
[1:51:54.940 --> 1:51:56.860]  Trump has now doubled the amount of troops
[1:51:56.860 --> 1:52:00.820]  in the Pacific, the Gulf and the Atlantic.
[1:52:00.820 --> 1:52:01.940]  Going after the drug cartels.
[1:52:01.940 --> 1:52:03.780]  And she says, it's a real emergency.
[1:52:03.780 --> 1:52:07.060]  Drugs are killing hundreds of thousands of people a year.
[1:52:07.060 --> 1:52:09.020]  Just opiates, hundreds of thousands.
[1:52:10.300 --> 1:52:12.860]  Well, then we're going to clamp down on that.
[1:52:12.860 --> 1:52:13.860]  That's not martial law, though.
[1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:15.340]  That's the military in the ocean.
[1:52:16.580 --> 1:52:17.900]  Thomas Jefferson sent the military
[1:52:17.900 --> 1:52:19.420]  to fight the barbaric pirates.
[1:52:19.420 --> 1:52:22.500]  I mean, we're robbing our ships.
[1:52:22.500 --> 1:52:24.460]  But Fauci says lockdown will continue
[1:52:24.460 --> 1:52:26.700]  until there are no new cases of coronavirus.
[1:52:26.700 --> 1:52:29.300]  And you're going to get your force inoculation.
[1:52:29.300 --> 1:52:34.300]  Corona again, Pentagon ordering 100,000 body bags.
[1:52:35.340 --> 1:52:37.220]  Coronavirus is now the third leading cause of death
[1:52:37.220 --> 1:52:38.900]  in the United States.
[1:52:38.900 --> 1:52:41.100]  And the flu usually is one of the top ones over here.
[1:52:43.620 --> 1:52:47.140]  How are we going to respond to that?
[1:52:47.140 --> 1:52:49.860]  Well, are we going to respond to this?
[1:52:49.860 --> 1:52:50.700]  Well, here we go again.
[1:52:50.700 --> 1:52:52.180]  China puts country on lockdown
[1:52:52.180 --> 1:52:53.660]  after new corona cluster emerges.
[1:52:53.660 --> 1:52:57.100]  Oh, now the Chinese economy has got a real reason
[1:52:57.100 --> 1:52:59.300]  to stop the people from rebelling.
[1:52:59.300 --> 1:53:02.380]  Chinese gave faulty contaminated COVID-19 equipment
[1:53:02.380 --> 1:53:04.340]  to several countries.
[1:53:04.340 --> 1:53:06.260]  Told you that weeks ago, now it's all admitted.
[1:53:06.260 --> 1:53:11.060]  But don't worry, don't worry now.
[1:53:11.060 --> 1:53:14.540]  China's flying more masks over here to save us.
[1:53:14.540 --> 1:53:17.060]  Even though US intelligence report concludes China
[1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:19.300]  has concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak.
[1:53:19.300 --> 1:53:20.380]  That's now official.
[1:53:20.380 --> 1:53:22.500]  We told you that nine weeks ago.
[1:53:22.500 --> 1:53:24.820]  So people say, hey, you said it was big nine weeks ago
[1:53:24.820 --> 1:53:25.660]  and get ready.
[1:53:25.660 --> 1:53:28.100]  Yeah, for the economic collapse, for the lockdown,
[1:53:28.100 --> 1:53:29.300]  and for the man-made virus.
[1:53:29.300 --> 1:53:30.860]  But it's just the trigger.
[1:53:32.380 --> 1:53:34.660]  And here we are again, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:53:36.100 --> 1:53:37.980]  You know, I get nasty, I get negative
[1:53:37.980 --> 1:53:40.940]  because I see a lot of compliance
[1:53:40.940 --> 1:53:42.100]  and people thinking it's virtuous.
[1:53:42.100 --> 1:53:43.700]  It's not virtuous.
[1:53:43.700 --> 1:53:45.900]  The Chinese rolling over to evil is not virtuous.
[1:53:45.900 --> 1:53:47.740]  The Chai comms using it to clamp down on Taiwan
[1:53:47.740 --> 1:53:48.700]  is not virtuous.
[1:53:48.700 --> 1:53:49.940]  The Chai comms lying about it,
[1:53:49.940 --> 1:53:51.860]  incubating it, the Democrats saying bring it in.
[1:53:51.860 --> 1:53:53.460]  It's not virtuous.
[1:53:53.460 --> 1:53:54.940]  When Trump said block the Chinese flights
[1:53:54.940 --> 1:53:56.300]  and the federal judges tried to block it
[1:53:56.300 --> 1:53:58.100]  for several weeks, that wasn't virtuous.
[1:53:58.100 --> 1:54:00.300]  But what's really not virtuous is that people
[1:54:00.300 --> 1:54:03.820]  don't cultivate a memory to remember
[1:54:03.820 --> 1:54:05.620]  what just happened a month ago.
[1:54:06.660 --> 1:54:08.900]  I've talked to people with degrees that are smart,
[1:54:08.900 --> 1:54:11.540]  that are supposedly successful, but they're mentally lazy.
[1:54:11.540 --> 1:54:12.940]  And I tell them this stuff.
[1:54:12.940 --> 1:54:15.180]  I go, remember the Democrats saying,
[1:54:15.180 --> 1:54:16.420]  don't block the Chinese flights.
[1:54:16.420 --> 1:54:18.220]  Like, no, I don't remember that.
[1:54:18.220 --> 1:54:20.500]  They're the ones criticizing Trump not doing enough.
[1:54:20.500 --> 1:54:21.620]  And you're being mentally lazy.
[1:54:21.620 --> 1:54:22.460]  Don't you remember?
[1:54:22.460 --> 1:54:25.220]  So I pull it up and I show them from a month ago,
[1:54:25.220 --> 1:54:28.460]  Pelosi from five weeks ago, they go, whatever.
[1:54:28.460 --> 1:54:29.780]  They don't care.
[1:54:29.780 --> 1:54:31.660]  They think me trying to show them something
[1:54:31.660 --> 1:54:33.580]  is I'm trying to show off to them.
[1:54:36.220 --> 1:54:39.180]  I walk into grocery stores now and I explain to them,
[1:54:39.180 --> 1:54:40.500]  it's all the way to take their rights
[1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:41.980]  and that's the real threat.
[1:54:41.980 --> 1:54:45.020]  Most folks go, yeah, I agree with you, I agree with you.
[1:54:45.020 --> 1:54:46.420]  But it has to be done.
[1:54:48.340 --> 1:54:49.540]  I'm gonna start the next hour.
[1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:51.260]  So I haven't covered one 10% of the news.
[1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:52.100]  We'll get to it all.
[1:54:52.100 --> 1:54:53.300]  G. Everett Griffith's coming up.
[1:54:53.300 --> 1:54:55.140]  I haven't plugged yet today.
[1:54:55.140 --> 1:54:58.140]  Listen, we're gonna sell out of X3.
[1:54:58.140 --> 1:54:59.140]  We sold out of X2.
[1:54:59.140 --> 1:55:00.940]  It's a long time when we get more X2.
[1:55:00.940 --> 1:55:02.180]  X3 is amazing.
[1:55:02.180 --> 1:55:03.220]  It's three types of iodide.
[1:55:03.220 --> 1:55:05.180]  All X will include the D3 crystals.
[1:55:05.180 --> 1:55:06.060]  It's apples and oranges.
[1:55:06.060 --> 1:55:07.460]  They both do the same thing.
[1:55:07.460 --> 1:55:08.860]  But some people like this formula better.
[1:55:08.860 --> 1:55:09.700]  I talked to scientists.
[1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:11.740]  They said some people need all three types.
[1:55:11.740 --> 1:55:13.140]  So it's here.
[1:55:13.140 --> 1:55:14.820]  And it's gonna run out in the one ounce
[1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:15.660]  the next couple of days.
[1:55:15.660 --> 1:55:17.860]  The two ounce in probably about a week or two
[1:55:17.860 --> 1:55:18.820]  at this current rate.
[1:55:19.820 --> 1:55:22.340]  But instead of 40% off, I just went to 60% off.
[1:55:23.660 --> 1:55:26.100]  So, you know, we're making 30% or so on that.
[1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:26.940]  But that's okay.
[1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:27.980]  I just want you to get it
[1:55:27.980 --> 1:55:30.340]  and you're gonna see it sell out.
[1:55:30.340 --> 1:55:31.420]  But I want you to have it
[1:55:31.420 --> 1:55:32.820]  and I want you to get real red pill plus.
[1:55:32.820 --> 1:55:33.900]  It's gonna be sold out soon.
[1:55:33.900 --> 1:55:37.180]  It's a 50% off and the real red pill will be sold out.
[1:55:37.180 --> 1:55:39.140]  We're gonna sell out of the Prostaguard
[1:55:39.140 --> 1:55:40.420]  that also has a big dose of zinc
[1:55:40.420 --> 1:55:42.620]  and copper and a bunch of other stuff.
[1:55:42.620 --> 1:55:43.700]  It's known to be really good for you
[1:55:43.700 --> 1:55:45.140]  and boost your defenses.
[1:55:45.140 --> 1:55:46.220]  That's gonna sell it in days.
[1:55:46.220 --> 1:55:48.220]  Vaso beats amazing for your overall body.
[1:55:48.220 --> 1:55:49.860]  Creates nitrous oxide in the blood.
[1:55:49.860 --> 1:55:51.540]  Just looking at what that does.
[1:55:51.540 --> 1:55:53.300]  Looking at what PQQ and CoQ10 does.
[1:55:53.300 --> 1:55:55.780]  And that's just some of the ingredients in DNA Force Plus.
[1:55:55.780 --> 1:55:57.460]  Absolutely the number one thing I'm taking
[1:55:57.460 --> 1:55:58.500]  along with the iodine.
[1:55:58.500 --> 1:56:03.500]  That's all 50% off at infowarstore.com right now.
[1:56:05.300 --> 1:56:09.700]  And go out and consult physicians.
[1:56:09.700 --> 1:56:11.500]  And every physician I've talked to,
[1:56:11.500 --> 1:56:13.860]  I've talked to a lot of them, I ran into an airplane,
[1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:16.940]  a airline pilot, flies for American yesterday.
[1:56:16.940 --> 1:56:19.260]  And then I was talking to a medical doctor.
[1:56:19.260 --> 1:56:22.020]  I'm gonna say where I was, what I was doing.
[1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:23.140]  He was like, oh, absolutely.
[1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:24.340]  You can't find zinc anywhere.
[1:56:24.340 --> 1:56:26.460]  I'm telling my patients, you know, take zinc.
[1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:27.380]  And I said, well, how much?
[1:56:27.380 --> 1:56:30.780]  And he said, hmm, 100 milligrams a day.
[1:56:30.780 --> 1:56:31.900]  And he goes, if you taste it later,
[1:56:31.900 --> 1:56:32.740]  it tastes kind of acid.
[1:56:32.740 --> 1:56:33.580]  He means you're on too much,
[1:56:33.580 --> 1:56:35.380]  but you know, they're giving 250 to people
[1:56:35.380 --> 1:56:36.500]  that already have it.
[1:56:36.500 --> 1:56:37.620]  And that's not good for your kidneys,
[1:56:37.620 --> 1:56:38.900]  but it's better than dying,
[1:56:38.900 --> 1:56:40.340]  but wouldn't do it long term.
[1:56:40.340 --> 1:56:43.420]  And I said, well, I've been taking 30 milligrams a day.
[1:56:43.420 --> 1:56:46.420]  And they said, yeah, I'd probably load up more than that.
[1:56:46.420 --> 1:56:49.460]  And I'll have to 100 milligrams this morning.
[1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:53.740]  So that's what I'm doing.
[1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:55.620]  And I'm as a human, according to media matters,
[1:56:55.620 --> 1:56:57.420]  George Soros, I'm supposed to tell you
[1:56:57.420 --> 1:56:58.780]  that that's what I'm doing.
[1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:01.060]  But you can go to the, because George Soros is God,
[1:57:01.060 --> 1:57:02.020]  is a Nazi collaborator.
[1:57:02.020 --> 1:57:02.980]  So he is God, I guess.
[1:57:02.980 --> 1:57:05.020]  If you go to the NIH and type in zinc,
[1:57:05.020 --> 1:57:07.260]  it'll tell you right there that it's an immune booster.
[1:57:07.260 --> 1:57:08.420]  You gotta have it to live,
[1:57:08.420 --> 1:57:10.180]  cleans out the cells, protects the mitochondria.
[1:57:10.180 --> 1:57:12.100]  But that's the NIH, I'll list it to them, you know.
[1:57:12.100 --> 1:57:14.820]  Only listen to CNN who's still saying
[1:57:14.820 --> 1:57:16.380]  hydroxychloroquine is bad,
[1:57:16.380 --> 1:57:18.180]  and there's no hope and you're all dead.
[1:57:19.180 --> 1:57:22.020]  Because only a vaccine will save you
[1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:24.220]  when there is no vaccine for the coronavirus
[1:57:24.220 --> 1:57:25.500]  because it's always mutated.
[1:57:25.500 --> 1:57:27.060]  But that's just two plus two equals four.
[1:57:27.060 --> 1:57:30.260]  Hey, CNN says men can have babies, biological men.
[1:57:30.260 --> 1:57:31.420]  The penises can have babies.
[1:57:31.420 --> 1:57:35.060]  It's not true that they're training you to accept delusion.
[1:57:35.060 --> 1:57:38.740]  So infowarstore.com, super blue toothpaste is selling out.
[1:57:38.740 --> 1:57:40.060]  We have a super silver cream.
[1:57:40.060 --> 1:57:42.100]  It's all there, infowarstore.com.

[1:57:57.300 --> 1:57:58.260]  that are in this baby.
[1:57:58.260 --> 1:58:00.340]  And then read some of those reviews for yourself.
[1:58:00.340 --> 1:58:01.860]  And then don't just believe info wars.
[1:58:01.860 --> 1:58:04.780]  Go out online at major nutrition sites and others
[1:58:04.780 --> 1:58:06.980]  and look at the studies for yourself.
[1:58:06.980 --> 1:58:09.340]  Go out and engage in your first amendment
[1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:11.260]  right to research and your first amendment right
[1:58:11.260 --> 1:58:14.140]  to tell others about the incredible compounds
[1:58:14.140 --> 1:58:15.820]  God has given us through Mother Nature.
[1:58:15.820 --> 1:58:18.140]  Living Defense is at infowarstore.com
[1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:19.820]  sold out for four months.
[1:58:19.820 --> 1:58:23.700]  Now back in stock for limited time at 40% off.
[1:58:23.700 --> 1:58:25.180]  People are doing their own research
[1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:27.740]  and they're getting Living Defense at 40% off
[1:58:27.740 --> 1:58:28.700]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:28.700 --> 1:58:31.140]  And we've got our great super blue toothpaste,
[1:58:31.140 --> 1:58:32.380]  the best seller for five years
[1:58:32.380 --> 1:58:34.780]  with the nano silver, the tea tree and the iodine.
[1:58:34.780 --> 1:58:36.540]  It's selling out still 50% off.
[1:58:36.540 --> 1:58:38.060]  And the iodine's selling out.
[1:58:38.060 --> 1:58:40.780]  The X3, it's 60% off because I want you
[1:58:40.780 --> 1:58:42.460]  to experience how amazing it is.
[1:58:46.780 --> 1:58:48.900]  Newtonian physics documents the fact
[1:58:48.900 --> 1:58:52.420]  that for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction
[1:58:52.420 --> 1:58:54.060]  and that matter is not destroyed,
[1:58:54.060 --> 1:58:57.380]  it is simply transferred into another form.
[1:58:57.380 --> 1:58:59.260]  Well, we're seeing that happen right now.
[1:58:59.260 --> 1:59:01.900]  The globalists are openly trying to hype up the coronavirus,
[1:59:01.900 --> 1:59:03.220]  trying to kill our economy
[1:59:03.220 --> 1:59:06.580]  and trying to have martial law shut down around the country
[1:59:06.580 --> 1:59:08.980]  and trying to stampede Trump into implementing it
[1:59:08.980 --> 1:59:12.060]  so they can blame the imploding economy on him.
[1:59:12.060 --> 1:59:13.420]  But Trump has seen through it
[1:59:13.420 --> 1:59:16.500]  and so he's let them implement the draconian controls
[1:59:16.500 --> 1:59:18.740]  and is saying, do you really want a depression
[1:59:18.740 --> 1:59:21.140]  for something that's killed far less than the flu?
[1:59:21.140 --> 1:59:23.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the fight of our lives.
[1:59:23.700 --> 1:59:26.900]  And the good news is their attack on humanity
[1:59:26.900 --> 1:59:29.340]  and on independent media has caused a lot of people
[1:59:29.340 --> 1:59:30.740]  to start thinking for themselves.
[1:59:30.740 --> 1:59:34.220]  And so the traffic to infowarstore.com and band.video
[1:59:34.220 --> 1:59:37.540]  is tripled our previous records right now.
[1:59:37.540 --> 1:59:40.020]  So you're doing a great job spreading the word
[1:59:40.020 --> 1:59:41.860]  and people are tuning in to find out the truth
[1:59:41.860 --> 1:59:45.180]  like never before because of you, the modern Paul Revere's.
[1:59:48.860 --> 1:59:51.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:51.940 --> 2:00:19.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, I just saw a video that is undoubtedly real.
[2:00:22.580 --> 2:00:25.180]  How do you know when you're 20 feet away
[2:00:25.180 --> 2:00:26.660]  that fruit in a bowl is real?
[2:00:26.660 --> 2:00:27.500]  You know.
[2:00:28.420 --> 2:00:30.140]  How do you know when Hillary's doing a fake
[2:00:30.140 --> 2:00:31.460]  infomercial with hired actors?
[2:00:31.460 --> 2:00:32.540]  They said it was a town hall
[2:00:32.540 --> 2:00:34.340]  which shot like 80 millimeter dust
[2:00:34.340 --> 2:00:35.540]  going through the air perfectly.
[2:00:35.540 --> 2:00:36.860]  Little kids handing her things.
[2:00:36.860 --> 2:00:38.540]  It was a commercial.
[2:00:38.540 --> 2:00:41.540]  It looked better shot than the Godfather.
[2:00:41.540 --> 2:00:42.580]  Then it came out six months later.
[2:00:42.580 --> 2:00:44.580]  It was totally fake and shot over three days.
[2:00:46.140 --> 2:00:48.580]  Well, they just took me in there in the studio
[2:00:48.580 --> 2:00:51.060]  and they said, you think this is real?
[2:00:51.060 --> 2:00:53.180]  And I watched it and I said,
[2:00:53.180 --> 2:00:55.540]  you bet you'll ask it's real.
[2:00:55.540 --> 2:01:01.540]  100% because I've worked in medical areas.
[2:01:01.580 --> 2:01:02.420]  I've seen it.
[2:01:02.420 --> 2:01:04.740]  I know people behave and I knew this was all coming
[2:01:04.740 --> 2:01:06.180]  and it's here.
[2:01:06.180 --> 2:01:10.180]  Forced coronavirus test, taking blood, the old test.
[2:01:10.180 --> 2:01:12.460]  Holding him down, sticking a needle in him.
[2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:13.540]  This is on Twitter.
[2:01:14.780 --> 2:01:16.420]  We're going to premiere it right here, right now.
[2:01:16.420 --> 2:01:17.260]  Here it is.
[2:01:17.260 --> 2:01:19.700]  Leave it alone, leave it alone, right here on the chair.
[2:01:19.700 --> 2:01:23.700]  Please leave me alone, please leave me alone.
[2:01:23.700 --> 2:01:26.700]  Please leave me alone, please leave me alone, bro.
[2:01:26.700 --> 2:01:28.340]  Not until you get on the bed.
[2:01:28.340 --> 2:01:29.340]  I'm not getting on the bed.
[2:01:29.340 --> 2:01:30.940]  No, man, help me, I don't, bro.
[2:01:30.940 --> 2:01:32.940]  It doesn't work like that, bro.
[2:01:32.940 --> 2:01:35.940]  Can I, anybody know a lawyer, bro?
[2:01:35.940 --> 2:01:37.940]  Somebody see me a lawyer?
[2:01:37.940 --> 2:01:39.940]  Bro, bro, no!
[2:01:39.940 --> 2:01:40.940]  Come on, James.
[2:01:40.940 --> 2:01:43.940]  It don't work like that, man, this ain't right, man.
[2:01:43.940 --> 2:01:45.940]  I was, nah, don't put the phone down.
[2:01:45.940 --> 2:01:47.940]  They don't want to fuck with me.
[2:01:47.940 --> 2:01:49.940]  Nah, bro, leave it alone.
[2:01:49.940 --> 2:01:50.940]  I don't want to leave it alone.
[2:01:50.940 --> 2:01:52.940]  It don't work like that.
[2:01:52.940 --> 2:01:55.940]  I'm sorry, we're going to believe it.
[2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:58.940]  The president cusses, the left cusses whenever they want.
[2:01:58.940 --> 2:02:02.940]  PBS, when I was a kid, they had cussing on a PBS show.
[2:02:02.940 --> 2:02:06.940]  Showing races, white people, cussing and black people.
[2:02:06.940 --> 2:02:07.940]  I remember looking at my mom and saying,
[2:02:07.940 --> 2:02:08.940]  how do they have cussing on TV?
[2:02:08.940 --> 2:02:10.940]  She said, it's documentary sign.
[2:02:10.940 --> 2:02:12.940]  She said, it's the lefts allowed to show cussing when they want,
[2:02:12.940 --> 2:02:13.940]  but I'm still going to believe it.
[2:02:13.940 --> 2:02:14.940]  We're going to have it for you in the next segment.
[2:02:14.940 --> 2:02:16.940]  It's unbelievable.
[2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:19.940]  Totally real.
[2:02:19.940 --> 2:02:21.940]  So you go in, somebody's coughing.
[2:02:21.940 --> 2:02:23.940]  Well, we're going to test you because, oh, it's big news
[2:02:23.940 --> 2:02:26.940]  that we find one of the COVID-19s.
[2:02:26.940 --> 2:02:28.940]  Then we can be all over the news.
[2:02:28.940 --> 2:02:29.940]  You've got the medical tyranny,
[2:02:29.940 --> 2:02:32.940]  muscling in to grab you and do the test.
[2:02:32.940 --> 2:02:35.940]  And they're going to fetishize it and praise everyone
[2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:37.940]  that acts like this and behaves like this.
[2:02:37.940 --> 2:02:39.940]  We're getting G. Ebert Griffin on right now,
[2:02:39.940 --> 2:02:41.940]  and then we'll play all the clips of China.
[2:02:41.940 --> 2:02:43.940]  People getting grabbed and drug away.
[2:02:43.940 --> 2:02:45.940]  And we'll have these bleeps and everything ready for it.
[2:02:45.940 --> 2:02:47.940]  We're going to upload it unbleaped,
[2:02:47.940 --> 2:02:53.940]  unbleaped to Band-Aid video right now.
[2:02:53.940 --> 2:02:54.940]  Right now.
[2:02:54.940 --> 2:02:59.940]  So China, secret arrest, drones, forced inoculations,
[2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:04.940]  forced blood-taking, grabbing people, dragging them around.
[2:03:04.940 --> 2:03:07.940]  It appeared on Twitter.
[2:03:07.940 --> 2:03:09.940]  Obviously, when a novice, this has done to them, they don't really,
[2:03:09.940 --> 2:03:10.940]  even like, they're not reporters.
[2:03:10.940 --> 2:03:11.940]  I was like, oh, this happened to me here.
[2:03:11.940 --> 2:03:12.940]  They say, look what just happened to me.
[2:03:12.940 --> 2:03:13.940]  But we've got the Twitter handle.
[2:03:13.940 --> 2:03:16.940]  We're contacting the folks that put it on Twitter.
[2:03:16.940 --> 2:03:18.940]  A man refused to be tested for COVID-19 pandemic
[2:03:18.940 --> 2:03:20.940]  and fights hospital staff until they force him down
[2:03:20.940 --> 2:03:24.940]  and take the blood.
[2:03:24.940 --> 2:03:27.940]  That's collapse post.
[2:03:27.940 --> 2:03:29.940]  Contact them and find out where they got that.
[2:03:29.940 --> 2:03:31.940]  That is real.
[2:03:31.940 --> 2:03:34.940]  I bet my life that's real.
[2:03:34.940 --> 2:03:36.940]  It's real.
[2:03:36.940 --> 2:03:38.940]  And now you're going to see more and more of that.
[2:03:38.940 --> 2:03:39.940]  You're going to see people getting in folks' faces.
[2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:41.940]  They leave their houses and say,
[2:03:41.940 --> 2:03:42.940]  let me see your phone app.
[2:03:42.940 --> 2:03:44.940]  And your phone will have a government app
[2:03:44.940 --> 2:03:46.940]  or through a corporate app that you're authorized.
[2:03:46.940 --> 2:03:48.940]  And they'll scan it and go, hmm, hmm.
[2:03:48.940 --> 2:03:50.940]  And it's going to be every season,
[2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:52.940]  and every, oh, new viruses, and oh,
[2:03:52.940 --> 2:03:54.940]  if you had your inoculation, even though it doesn't cover you.
[2:03:54.940 --> 2:03:56.940]  And if you say, hey, the inoculation doesn't cover you,
[2:03:56.940 --> 2:03:58.940]  they'll go, oh, you're arrested.
[2:03:58.940 --> 2:04:00.940]  That's disinformation.
[2:04:00.940 --> 2:04:03.940]  Oliver Darcy says so.
[2:04:03.940 --> 2:04:05.940]  But remember, when they forcibly inoculate you
[2:04:05.940 --> 2:04:08.940]  and your child has a convulsion and dies,
[2:04:08.940 --> 2:04:10.940]  they killed your child.
[2:04:10.940 --> 2:04:12.940]  Bill Gates killed your child.
[2:04:12.940 --> 2:04:14.940]  Oliver Darcy killed your child,
[2:04:14.940 --> 2:04:16.940]  because they didn't let you have free speech in America
[2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:19.940]  to say a big, secret medical, secret level four
[2:04:19.940 --> 2:04:21.940]  government weapon system that's been caught
[2:04:21.940 --> 2:04:23.940]  injecting black people with syphilis
[2:04:23.940 --> 2:04:25.940]  and radiating appellation kids
[2:04:25.940 --> 2:04:27.940]  and thousands of other secret lethal tests
[2:04:27.940 --> 2:04:29.940]  is now doing it out in the open with a scyop,
[2:04:29.940 --> 2:04:31.940]  trying to make us take these deadly vaccines
[2:04:31.940 --> 2:04:34.940]  to soft kill us and sterilize us and destroy us.
[2:04:34.940 --> 2:04:36.940]  So they're coming with force,
[2:04:36.940 --> 2:04:39.940]  but saying it's medical, so it's not an attack.
[2:04:39.940 --> 2:04:42.940]  I see if Hitler comes with tanks, you're fighting.
[2:04:42.940 --> 2:04:44.940]  But if Hitler would have come with medical workers
[2:04:44.940 --> 2:04:46.940]  to help the Russians fight a virus,
[2:04:46.940 --> 2:04:48.940]  the Russians would have stood down
[2:04:48.940 --> 2:04:50.940]  and Hitler would have taken over.
[2:04:50.940 --> 2:05:10.940]  Same thing with England.
[2:05:21.940 --> 2:05:24.940]  Trump's desperately trying to restart it
[2:05:24.940 --> 2:05:27.940]  and create confidence in the globalist corporate media
[2:05:27.940 --> 2:05:30.940]  that was worshiping China just a month or so ago,
[2:05:30.940 --> 2:05:33.940]  and their response is saying Trump is terrible
[2:05:33.940 --> 2:05:35.940]  because they want America to fail,
[2:05:35.940 --> 2:05:38.940]  they want you to fail, but you can expose them,
[2:05:38.940 --> 2:05:40.940]  you can speak out, you can share the articles
[2:05:40.940 --> 2:05:42.940]  and videos and reports at Info Wars
[2:05:42.940 --> 2:05:44.940]  and Band-Aught Video that expose them
[2:05:44.940 --> 2:05:46.940]  and the globalist will go down.
[2:05:46.940 --> 2:05:48.940]  It's already blowing up in their face right now,
[2:05:48.940 --> 2:05:50.940]  so press the attack on the Info War
[2:05:50.940 --> 2:06:19.940]  and defeat the NWO.
[2:06:20.940 --> 2:06:30.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live,
[2:06:30.940 --> 2:06:32.940]  and we're having to bleep it.
[2:06:32.940 --> 2:06:35.940]  And we found a Twitter account
[2:06:35.940 --> 2:06:38.940]  that's got all real stuff from the past days.
[2:06:38.940 --> 2:06:42.940]  The FBI raiding masks, fights, shopping malls,
[2:06:42.940 --> 2:06:44.940]  police arresting people,
[2:06:44.940 --> 2:06:47.940]  and then they got footage that clearly,
[2:06:47.940 --> 2:06:49.940]  I worked as a dental assistant in college,
[2:06:49.940 --> 2:06:51.940]  I've been around it, you've seen it.
[2:06:51.940 --> 2:06:53.940]  These are real nurses holding a guy down
[2:06:53.940 --> 2:06:56.940]  and taking his blood for COVID-19.
[2:06:56.940 --> 2:06:59.940]  Go ahead and scroll down a little bit faster, thanks.
[2:06:59.940 --> 2:07:05.940]  And so we're going to be getting to that
[2:07:05.940 --> 2:07:10.940]  as soon as we're able to bleep it for radio and TV
[2:07:10.940 --> 2:07:12.940]  because we're not NPR, we're not CNN,
[2:07:12.940 --> 2:07:14.940]  we're not allowed to cast as conservative Christians,
[2:07:14.940 --> 2:07:17.940]  even though we don't want to, we don't have the same rights
[2:07:17.940 --> 2:07:21.940]  because we're pro-America.
[2:07:21.940 --> 2:07:24.940]  Do you have a griffin scheduled to be on?
[2:07:24.940 --> 2:07:26.940]  I wanted to get him on about the Federal Reserve
[2:07:26.940 --> 2:07:28.940]  and is Trump really nationalizing it?
[2:07:28.940 --> 2:07:30.940]  I mean, he did nationalize part of it, that's confirmed.
[2:07:30.940 --> 2:07:31.940]  What does he think?
[2:07:31.940 --> 2:07:33.940]  There's so many other insane facets that are breaking right now
[2:07:33.940 --> 2:07:35.940]  on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com
[2:07:35.940 --> 2:07:40.940]  and just things that illustrate the insanity of what we're facing.
[2:07:40.940 --> 2:07:43.940]  But I want to roll Rush Limbaugh that I didn't get to earlier,
[2:07:43.940 --> 2:07:46.940]  talking about how the hospitals, they say are full and they're empty.
[2:07:46.940 --> 2:07:50.940]  We have posted more than 10 videos, I said it was eight last hour,
[2:07:50.940 --> 2:07:56.940]  in the last three weeks, that are compilations of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 videos,
[2:07:56.940 --> 2:07:59.940]  some of these are like an hour long, of people showing local newscasts
[2:07:59.940 --> 2:08:02.940]  that the hospital's full, there's people dying everywhere,
[2:08:02.940 --> 2:08:06.940]  and they go there and the same day, in broad daylight,
[2:08:06.940 --> 2:08:09.940]  and there's no one there and it's empty.
[2:08:09.940 --> 2:08:11.940]  This is the media hyping this.
[2:08:11.940 --> 2:08:15.940]  I'm not saying people aren't dying, but what have died nationwide?
[2:08:15.940 --> 2:08:17.940]  Can we put the map up from the World Health Organization?
[2:08:17.940 --> 2:08:20.940]  Even if that's accurate, probably not, probably exaggerated.
[2:08:20.940 --> 2:08:22.940]  A lot of people have died of something else.
[2:08:22.940 --> 2:08:24.940]  They just say COVID-19 are their positive.
[2:08:24.940 --> 2:08:26.940]  But 30,000 died on average, 35,000.
[2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:31.940]  80,000 died of the flu in 2018.
[2:08:31.940 --> 2:08:33.940]  So let's say this kills 80,000.
[2:08:33.940 --> 2:08:35.940]  That's what I've been projecting for months.
[2:08:35.940 --> 2:08:38.940]  It's a weaponized coal bug and it's terrible.
[2:08:38.940 --> 2:08:40.940]  But what does all this do?
[2:08:40.940 --> 2:08:41.940]  It doesn't even protect you.
[2:08:41.940 --> 2:08:44.940]  And now they say, oh, we got a lockdown next fall.
[2:08:44.940 --> 2:08:48.940]  So total deaths worldwide, 50,000.
[2:08:48.940 --> 2:08:50.940]  Okay?
[2:08:50.940 --> 2:08:53.940]  Almost a million worldwide, 981,000.
[2:08:53.940 --> 2:08:57.940]  And let's look at U.S. deaths.
[2:08:57.940 --> 2:09:03.940]  Let me just click on that so I can see U.S. deaths, please.
[2:09:03.940 --> 2:09:09.940]  Total number of U.S. deaths, 5,316.
[2:09:09.940 --> 2:09:12.940]  And they say it's going to peak in a couple weeks
[2:09:12.940 --> 2:09:14.940]  at like 30,000.
[2:09:14.940 --> 2:09:16.940]  And then they think maybe it's 100,000, maybe 200,000.
[2:09:16.940 --> 2:09:19.940]  And then most of these people are already super ill.
[2:09:19.940 --> 2:09:22.940]  And then I got all these articles from California to New York,
[2:09:22.940 --> 2:09:24.940]  the worst hit places, where they're telling nurses,
[2:09:24.940 --> 2:09:26.940]  don't wear a mask.
[2:09:26.940 --> 2:09:31.940]  Well, if you're healthy, you just become an incubator for it.
[2:09:31.940 --> 2:09:35.940]  So Limbaugh, who I wish he had a bigger crew
[2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:41.940]  and I hope he survives his lung cancer.
[2:09:41.940 --> 2:09:44.940]  Limbaugh was really kind of a long way understand
[2:09:44.940 --> 2:09:46.940]  of the New World Order.
[2:09:46.940 --> 2:09:48.940]  And I know he's a listener.
[2:09:48.940 --> 2:09:51.940]  He reads our articles on air now. That's good.
[2:09:51.940 --> 2:09:54.940]  He said he'd be removed from air if he told you what he really thinks.
[2:09:54.940 --> 2:09:56.940]  Well, I know what he really thinks.
[2:09:56.940 --> 2:09:58.940]  And this is a total hoax to bring down America
[2:09:58.940 --> 2:10:00.940]  on a weaponized system.
[2:10:00.940 --> 2:10:03.940]  And Trump's been basically blackmailed by the nation's cowardice
[2:10:03.940 --> 2:10:06.940]  and demanding police state into going on what we want.
[2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:08.940]  It's not like Pontius Pilate.
[2:10:08.940 --> 2:10:10.940]  He says, do you want Jesus Christ?
[2:10:10.940 --> 2:10:12.940]  And it was on the Holy Jewish Day.
[2:10:12.940 --> 2:10:14.940]  So they got to choose one guy they would release.
[2:10:14.940 --> 2:10:16.940]  It was a custom by the Roman judge.
[2:10:16.940 --> 2:10:18.940]  And they say, give us Barabbas.
[2:10:18.940 --> 2:10:21.940]  And Trump, eight weeks ago, five weeks ago said, hey,
[2:10:21.940 --> 2:10:23.940]  we're tough. We can handle it. We'll mitigate it.
[2:10:23.940 --> 2:10:25.940]  We shouldn't shut things down.
[2:10:25.940 --> 2:10:27.940]  And people said, no, we want to be slaves.
[2:10:27.940 --> 2:10:29.940]  We want to follow how the Democrats did it.
[2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:31.940]  Now the Chinese did it. Now the EU did it.
[2:10:31.940 --> 2:10:33.940]  Give us tyranny. Give us Barabbas.
[2:10:33.940 --> 2:10:35.940]  And so as the judge, he said, OK, well,
[2:10:35.940 --> 2:10:37.940]  I don't want to totally shut down for 18 months.
[2:10:37.940 --> 2:10:39.940]  How about a month?
[2:10:39.940 --> 2:10:41.940]  How about 14 days? No, forever.
[2:10:41.940 --> 2:10:43.940]  There can't be one death.
[2:10:45.940 --> 2:10:47.940]  And then Project Veritas goes to hospitals,
[2:10:47.940 --> 2:10:50.940]  talks to National Guard, talks to police,
[2:10:50.940 --> 2:10:53.940]  talks to nurses, doctors.
[2:10:53.940 --> 2:10:55.940]  They say, we think it's way overblown.
[2:10:55.940 --> 2:10:57.940]  America can handle this.
[2:10:57.940 --> 2:10:59.940]  Yeah, the news is saying we're full of people here.
[2:10:59.940 --> 2:11:02.940]  We're not. That's a fact check.
[2:11:02.940 --> 2:11:04.940]  Oliver Darcy had it removed
[2:11:04.940 --> 2:11:07.940]  off of YouTube
[2:11:07.940 --> 2:11:09.940]  and is trying to get his videos taken off of Twitter.
[2:11:09.940 --> 2:11:11.940]  Award-winning.
[2:11:11.940 --> 2:11:13.940]  He's now being taken off the Internet
[2:11:13.940 --> 2:11:15.940]  because Oliver Darcy said to Tweet,
[2:11:15.940 --> 2:11:17.940]  this could tell people that things aren't as bad
[2:11:17.940 --> 2:11:19.940]  and they won't take precautions.
[2:11:19.940 --> 2:11:21.940]  And then it'll kill more. You see, he's the boss
[2:11:21.940 --> 2:11:23.940]  than anything. He's going to keep you safe.
[2:11:23.940 --> 2:11:25.940]  He decides who can be online.
[2:11:25.940 --> 2:11:27.940]  He's Oliver Darcy.
[2:11:29.940 --> 2:11:32.940]  And now it's the president of Brazil.
[2:11:32.940 --> 2:11:34.940]  And now it's Trump when he said,
[2:11:34.940 --> 2:11:37.940]  how dare you say there's studies that could help?
[2:11:37.940 --> 2:11:39.940]  But they had to approve it because it's true.
[2:11:39.940 --> 2:11:41.940]  They don't want hope. These are horrible monsters
[2:11:41.940 --> 2:11:43.940]  who think you're weak and stupid and scared
[2:11:43.940 --> 2:11:45.940]  and they know what they're doing.
[2:11:45.940 --> 2:11:48.940]  Here's Limbaugh laying it out and we'll roll some footage over it.
[2:11:48.940 --> 2:11:50.940]  But you've got to hear it. People are like,
[2:11:50.940 --> 2:11:52.940]  I live down the street. It was just on the news.
[2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:54.940]  They went live. There's like 10 of those videos.
[2:11:54.940 --> 2:11:56.940]  I just drove over here. It's a lie.
[2:11:56.940 --> 2:11:59.940]  In fact, there's the reporter and there's footage.
[2:11:59.940 --> 2:12:01.940]  I've got to go through these where people go over the reporter
[2:12:01.940 --> 2:12:04.940]  and go, you just said this place was full. It's not.
[2:12:04.940 --> 2:12:07.940]  The reporters go, get away from me.
[2:12:07.940 --> 2:12:09.940]  I mean, we have them.
[2:12:09.940 --> 2:12:12.940]  They are absolutely hyping this
[2:12:12.940 --> 2:12:14.940]  like it's the end of the world to scare you
[2:12:14.940 --> 2:12:16.940]  to accept the end of our way of life
[2:12:16.940 --> 2:12:18.940]  and being locked up in our homes. Here's Limbaugh.
[2:12:18.940 --> 2:12:21.940]  Now, of course, we here
[2:12:21.940 --> 2:12:24.940]  at the EIV Southern Command are in South Florida.
[2:12:24.940 --> 2:12:26.940]  We're in Palm Beach County,
[2:12:26.940 --> 2:12:29.940]  which geographically is a large county.
[2:12:29.940 --> 2:12:31.940]  And so you would think,
[2:12:31.940 --> 2:12:33.940]  look at the case data here
[2:12:33.940 --> 2:12:36.940]  for Palm Beach, a number of cases,
[2:12:36.940 --> 2:12:39.940]  coronavirus,
[2:12:39.940 --> 2:12:41.940]  a number of deaths.
[2:12:41.940 --> 2:12:43.940]  But one of the things that interests me
[2:12:43.940 --> 2:12:45.940]  is the hospitalization numbers.
[2:12:45.940 --> 2:12:47.940]  Because if you look at Drudge,
[2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:49.940]  if you look at the drive-by media,
[2:12:49.940 --> 2:12:51.940]  you would believe there's not a single hospital bed
[2:12:51.940 --> 2:12:53.940]  in this country, right?
[2:12:53.940 --> 2:12:55.940]  You have been led to believe
[2:12:55.940 --> 2:12:57.940]  that every hospital is overflowing,
[2:12:57.940 --> 2:12:59.940]  and body bags and refrigerated trucks
[2:12:59.940 --> 2:13:02.940]  are being parked off the landfills or whatever.
[2:13:02.940 --> 2:13:04.940]  I mean, some of the most incredible reporting
[2:13:04.940 --> 2:13:06.940]  I have seen.
[2:13:06.940 --> 2:13:08.940]  And it is in New York.
[2:13:08.940 --> 2:13:11.940]  It is in Washington, D.C.
[2:13:11.940 --> 2:13:13.940]  Maryland,
[2:13:13.940 --> 2:13:15.940]  the Eastern Seaboard states
[2:13:15.940 --> 2:13:17.940]  that there's not a hospital bed around,
[2:13:17.940 --> 2:13:19.940]  that the hospitals are overflowing.
[2:13:19.940 --> 2:13:21.940]  If you have to go to the hospital,
[2:13:21.940 --> 2:13:23.940]  you may as well just pack it in and die.
[2:13:23.940 --> 2:13:25.940]  So I wanted to find out what the hospitalization rates
[2:13:25.940 --> 2:13:27.940]  are in Palm Beach County.
[2:13:27.940 --> 2:13:29.940]  Because we've been shut down like everybody else has.
[2:13:29.940 --> 2:13:31.940]  We've been shut down through the middle of April.
[2:13:31.940 --> 2:13:33.940]  They get shelter in place,
[2:13:33.940 --> 2:13:35.940]  and you better not be caught on the beach.
[2:13:35.940 --> 2:13:37.940]  The turtles can go to the beach, so we can't.
[2:13:37.940 --> 2:13:39.940]  You better not get caught on the beach.
[2:13:41.940 --> 2:13:43.940]  You better not be caught
[2:13:43.940 --> 2:13:45.940]  within 10 feet of anybody else.
[2:13:45.940 --> 2:13:47.940]  Or they'll write you up.
[2:13:49.940 --> 2:13:51.940]  On the town website.
[2:13:51.940 --> 2:13:53.940]  Anyway,
[2:13:53.940 --> 2:13:55.940]  here's the case data for Palm Beach County.
[2:13:57.940 --> 2:13:59.940]  Total cases in Palm Beach County
[2:13:59.940 --> 2:14:01.940]  of coronavirus 514.
[2:14:03.940 --> 2:14:05.940]  Of the 514 cases,
[2:14:05.940 --> 2:14:07.940]  488 are residents
[2:14:07.940 --> 2:14:09.940]  of Palm Beach County.
[2:14:11.940 --> 2:14:13.940]  24 are non-residents.
[2:14:15.940 --> 2:14:17.940]  The age range, 0 to 99,
[2:14:17.940 --> 2:14:19.940]  men 268,
[2:14:19.940 --> 2:14:21.940]  cases women 237,
[2:14:21.940 --> 2:14:23.940]  so it's fairly
[2:14:23.940 --> 2:14:25.940]  equal. There have been 11 deaths
[2:14:25.940 --> 2:14:27.940]  in Palm Beach County since this
[2:14:27.940 --> 2:14:29.940]  all began to be tabulated.
[2:14:29.940 --> 2:14:31.940]  Now, I don't
[2:14:31.940 --> 2:14:33.940]  have data for other states.
[2:14:33.940 --> 2:14:35.940]  That will come at some point. I've got a website here
[2:14:35.940 --> 2:14:37.940]  where we, this is Florida's COVID-19
[2:14:37.940 --> 2:14:39.940]  data surveillance dashboard.
[2:14:39.940 --> 2:14:41.940]  And it's the latest official numbers
[2:14:41.940 --> 2:14:43.940]  from the Florida Department of Health.
[2:14:43.940 --> 2:14:45.940]  So,
[2:14:45.940 --> 2:14:47.940]  and the numbers on the radio
[2:14:47.940 --> 2:14:49.940]  are not enough to follow. Let me go again.
[2:14:49.940 --> 2:14:51.940]  Total cases in Palm Beach County
[2:14:51.940 --> 2:14:53.940]  514.
[2:14:53.940 --> 2:14:55.940]  Total deaths 11.
[2:14:55.940 --> 2:14:57.940]  Hospitalizations.
[2:14:59.940 --> 2:15:01.940]  The number of people
[2:15:01.940 --> 2:15:03.940]  who are hospitalized
[2:15:03.940 --> 2:15:05.940]  with coronavirus 57.
[2:15:05.940 --> 2:15:07.940]  Does that strike you
[2:15:07.940 --> 2:15:09.940]  as a large number?
[2:15:11.940 --> 2:15:13.940]  I want you to think
[2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:15.940]  of the way this is being reported.
[2:15:15.940 --> 2:15:17.940]  Particularly about
[2:15:17.940 --> 2:15:19.940]  New York and other places
[2:15:19.940 --> 2:15:21.940]  where there's not a hospital
[2:15:21.940 --> 2:15:23.940]  bed to be had.
[2:15:23.940 --> 2:15:25.940]  Where they're putting people in the hallways.
[2:15:25.940 --> 2:15:27.940]  There's no ventilators. There's no
[2:15:27.940 --> 2:15:29.940]  nothing. We have a guy
[2:15:29.940 --> 2:15:31.940]  with a bad shape out there.
[2:15:31.940 --> 2:15:33.940]  We're going to come
[2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:35.940]  right back here.
[2:15:35.940 --> 2:15:37.940]  We have hours of footage of empty hospitals.
[2:15:37.940 --> 2:15:39.940]  It's a hoax.
[2:15:39.940 --> 2:15:41.940]  The virus isn't real,
[2:15:41.940 --> 2:15:43.940]  but out of 337 million
[2:15:43.940 --> 2:15:45.940]  plus 49 illegal aliens
[2:15:45.940 --> 2:15:47.940]  close to 370 million
[2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:49.940]  this is super rare
[2:15:49.940 --> 2:16:17.940]  that it actually hurts you.
[2:16:19.940 --> 2:16:21.940]  You can still get enough
[2:16:21.940 --> 2:16:23.940]  open pollinated heirloom seeds
[2:16:23.940 --> 2:16:25.940]  to grow a 1 acre crisis garden.
[2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:27.940]  The truth is
[2:16:27.940 --> 2:16:29.940]  growing nutrient dense vegetables
[2:16:29.940 --> 2:16:31.940]  in the days ahead may actually be
[2:16:31.940 --> 2:16:33.940]  the single most important thing you do.
[2:16:33.940 --> 2:16:35.940]  Go to survivalseedbank.com

[2:16:37.940 --> 2:16:39.940]  the nature of the threat.

[2:16:53.940 --> 2:16:55.940]  these are troubled times, right?

[2:16:57.940 --> 2:16:59.940]  Whether it's a big company

[2:17:01.940 --> 2:17:03.940]  or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected

[2:17:53.940 --> 2:17:55.940]  I don't want to sit here and say
[2:17:55.940 --> 2:17:57.940]  see I told you so, so people say oh
[2:17:57.940 --> 2:17:59.940]  Alex Jones is so smart
[2:17:59.940 --> 2:18:01.940]  oh he's so great
[2:18:01.940 --> 2:18:03.940]  I can hear less about that.
[2:18:03.940 --> 2:18:05.940]  I want you to understand that
[2:18:05.940 --> 2:18:07.940]  back in mid-January
[2:18:07.940 --> 2:18:09.940]  during a whole fake impeachment fiasco
[2:18:09.940 --> 2:18:11.940]  and the rest of it
[2:18:11.940 --> 2:18:13.940]  we found out that the big issue
[2:18:13.940 --> 2:18:15.940]  would be the next move
[2:18:15.940 --> 2:18:17.940]  the next attack the Globals were going to launch
[2:18:17.940 --> 2:18:19.940]  they knew they didn't have the votes back then
[2:18:19.940 --> 2:18:21.940]  and I said it would be an attack on the economy
[2:18:21.940 --> 2:18:23.940]  because criminals loved to brag
[2:18:23.940 --> 2:18:25.940]  and they were telegraphing
[2:18:25.940 --> 2:18:27.940]  the entire thing
[2:18:27.940 --> 2:18:29.940]  and now here we are ladies and gentlemen
[2:18:29.940 --> 2:18:31.940]  our economy shut down for over a month
[2:18:31.940 --> 2:18:33.940]  certain depression if it continues
[2:18:33.940 --> 2:18:35.940]  for more than a month and a half or so
[2:18:35.940 --> 2:18:37.940]  maybe even shorter
[2:18:37.940 --> 2:18:39.940]  and Americans have failed the test
[2:18:39.940 --> 2:18:41.940]  they have gotten into the fear
[2:18:41.940 --> 2:18:43.940]  they've enjoyed not going into work
[2:18:43.940 --> 2:18:45.940]  it's been a new drama
[2:18:45.940 --> 2:18:47.940]  and the Globals were saying
[2:18:47.940 --> 2:18:49.940]  let's destroy their way of life
[2:18:49.940 --> 2:18:51.940]  let's kill their confidence and give them a depression
[2:18:51.940 --> 2:18:53.940]  people better wake up now
[2:18:53.940 --> 2:18:55.940]  one of our best selling products
[2:18:55.940 --> 2:18:57.940]  is living defense and it's been sold out
[2:18:57.940 --> 2:18:59.940]  for over four months because it's hard
[2:18:59.940 --> 2:19:01.940]  to source the ingredients that are organic
[2:19:01.940 --> 2:19:03.940]  we've got a limited supply right now
[2:19:03.940 --> 2:19:05.940]  but it's selling out fast and I want those of you
[2:19:05.940 --> 2:19:07.940]  that haven't experienced living defense
[2:19:07.940 --> 2:19:09.940]  you're just part of one testimonial
[2:19:37.940 --> 2:19:39.940]  you know what I'm going to get me
[2:19:39.940 --> 2:19:41.940]  some of that freaking living defense
[2:19:41.940 --> 2:19:43.940]  now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional
[2:19:43.940 --> 2:19:45.940]  because they don't want you to have it
[2:19:45.940 --> 2:19:47.940]  but I ordered it and it shipped to me
[2:19:47.940 --> 2:19:49.940]  I got it, I hid it from the nurses
[2:19:49.940 --> 2:19:51.940]  I started taking it man
[2:19:51.940 --> 2:19:53.940]  that stuff changed my life
[2:19:53.940 --> 2:19:55.940]  it saved my life
[2:19:55.940 --> 2:20:07.940]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:20:25.940 --> 2:20:35.940]  music
[2:20:35.940 --> 2:20:37.940]  I'm a bleep between a monkey
[2:20:37.940 --> 2:20:41.940]  all my friends are junkies
[2:20:41.940 --> 2:20:45.940]  that's not really true
[2:20:45.940 --> 2:20:47.940]  I'm a great battalion pizza
[2:20:47.940 --> 2:20:51.940]  I could use a lemon squeezer
[2:20:51.940 --> 2:20:55.940]  what you do
[2:20:55.940 --> 2:20:57.940]  okay ladies and gentlemen
[2:20:57.940 --> 2:20:59.940]  I cannot continue the broadcast
[2:20:59.940 --> 2:21:01.940]  at this time
[2:21:01.940 --> 2:21:07.940]  I already knew this
[2:21:07.940 --> 2:21:09.940]  and I received this during the break
[2:21:09.940 --> 2:21:11.940]  four minutes ago, five minutes ago
[2:21:11.940 --> 2:21:13.940]  and I checked the sources
[2:21:13.940 --> 2:21:15.940]  and it reminded me of
[2:21:15.940 --> 2:21:21.940]  30 plus cases of where the UN got caught
[2:21:21.940 --> 2:21:29.940]  adding HIV and polio viruses
[2:21:29.940 --> 2:21:33.940]  in the vaccines
[2:21:33.940 --> 2:21:35.940]  and so I'm not going to cover this
[2:21:35.940 --> 2:21:37.940]  till we've printed those articles
[2:21:37.940 --> 2:21:39.940]  the boom operator has a better memory than I do
[2:21:39.940 --> 2:21:41.940]  and he remembered the exact African countries
[2:21:41.940 --> 2:21:43.940]  and so we're getting those articles printed
[2:21:43.940 --> 2:21:45.940]  this is like seven years ago
[2:21:45.940 --> 2:21:47.940]  one of the cases
[2:21:47.940 --> 2:21:49.940]  they also caught them putting in vaccines
[2:21:49.940 --> 2:21:51.940]  a female hormone that's secreted
[2:21:51.940 --> 2:21:53.940]  during the beginning of the second trimester
[2:21:53.940 --> 2:21:55.940]  so it triggers an auto-abortion
[2:21:55.940 --> 2:21:57.940]  and they copy you in doing that
[2:21:57.940 --> 2:21:59.940]  in the tetanus shot
[2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:01.940]  I'm going to pull that as well
[2:22:01.940 --> 2:22:03.940]  before I cover this
[2:22:03.940 --> 2:22:05.940]  now
[2:22:05.940 --> 2:22:07.940]  I already knew this today
[2:22:07.940 --> 2:22:09.940]  and I meant to lead the show with it last night
[2:22:09.940 --> 2:22:11.940]  then I saw the Fauci press conference
[2:22:11.940 --> 2:22:13.940]  and I watched it like when the kids went to bed
[2:22:13.940 --> 2:22:15.940]  like nine of my wife, we watched an hour and a half
[2:22:15.940 --> 2:22:17.940]  the whole thing
[2:22:17.940 --> 2:22:19.940]  and I got so pissed about that
[2:22:19.940 --> 2:22:21.940]  when they openly announced all that
[2:22:21.940 --> 2:22:23.940]  it's the lock-down forever in forced inoculations
[2:22:23.940 --> 2:22:25.940]  because I knew that was coming
[2:22:25.940 --> 2:22:27.940]  but it was just still seeing it
[2:22:27.940 --> 2:22:29.940]  knowing it's coming and then coming
[2:22:29.940 --> 2:22:31.940]  is a different thing
[2:22:31.940 --> 2:22:33.940]  knowing deaths coming from your grandma or grandpa
[2:22:33.940 --> 2:22:35.940]  your father or mother and actually they're dead
[2:22:35.940 --> 2:22:37.940]  and they're gone
[2:22:37.940 --> 2:22:39.940]  it's a little bit different deal
[2:22:39.940 --> 2:22:41.940]  you see the car running red light
[2:22:41.940 --> 2:22:43.940]  they're going to hit them and all of a sudden
[2:22:43.940 --> 2:22:45.940]  you know they're going to hit them
[2:22:45.940 --> 2:22:47.940]  but when you see them smashing their guts all over the ground
[2:22:47.940 --> 2:22:49.940]  and you run over in the blood spurt now
[2:22:49.940 --> 2:22:51.940]  and you're trying to save them
[2:22:51.940 --> 2:22:53.940]  it's just a little bit different
[2:22:53.940 --> 2:22:55.940]  so we're here
[2:22:55.940 --> 2:22:57.940]  if there's no it's coming
[2:22:57.940 --> 2:22:59.940]  I kept warning everybody
[2:22:59.940 --> 2:23:01.940]  and
[2:23:01.940 --> 2:23:03.940]  we've got footage
[2:23:03.940 --> 2:23:05.940]  of them grabbing people
[2:23:05.940 --> 2:23:07.940]  and forcibly taking blood in the US
[2:23:07.940 --> 2:23:09.940]  we're going to air that
[2:23:09.940 --> 2:23:11.940]  next time
[2:23:11.940 --> 2:23:13.940]  I just cancelled Griffin because this is too important
[2:23:13.940 --> 2:23:15.940]  he's excellent
[2:23:15.940 --> 2:23:17.940]  but this is too important
[2:23:17.940 --> 2:23:19.940]  then I got this new info
[2:23:19.940 --> 2:23:21.940]  Rob walked in here
[2:23:25.940 --> 2:23:27.940]  and this morning I saw this two days
[2:23:27.940 --> 2:23:29.940]  ago and didn't even
[2:23:29.940 --> 2:23:31.940]  make the point on air even though I meant to
[2:23:31.940 --> 2:23:33.940]  see I'm really mad at myself right now
[2:23:33.940 --> 2:23:35.940]  that's why I've got to go to a special report
[2:23:35.940 --> 2:23:37.940]  or something that just
[2:23:37.940 --> 2:23:39.940]  it's not that I don't know enough
[2:23:39.940 --> 2:23:41.940]  I know too much
[2:23:41.940 --> 2:23:43.940]  people understand I don't just say stuff
[2:23:43.940 --> 2:23:45.940]  I have thousands of data points
[2:23:45.940 --> 2:23:47.940]  coming in right now okay
[2:23:47.940 --> 2:23:49.940]  I mean just total proof of all this
[2:23:49.940 --> 2:23:51.940]  and
[2:23:51.940 --> 2:23:53.940]  I've got to somehow turn the data flow off
[2:23:53.940 --> 2:23:55.940]  and just go with the five or six data points
[2:23:55.940 --> 2:23:57.940]  I've got in front of me
[2:23:57.940 --> 2:23:59.940]  because I have this OCD frustration that
[2:23:59.940 --> 2:24:01.940]  I'm not giving you all of it
[2:24:01.940 --> 2:24:03.940]  it's like I should give you everything
[2:24:03.940 --> 2:24:05.940]  it's almost like a lie if you don't give them everything
[2:24:05.940 --> 2:24:07.940]  but it's impossible to give you everything
[2:24:07.940 --> 2:24:09.940]  because there's so much
[2:24:09.940 --> 2:24:11.940]  actually it's been in the news
[2:24:11.940 --> 2:24:13.940]  for a week that the Chinese on purpose
[2:24:13.940 --> 2:24:15.940]  ship contaminated masks and
[2:24:15.940 --> 2:24:17.940]  test kits to give people the virus
[2:24:17.940 --> 2:24:19.940]  caught red-handed launching the bio-weapon
[2:24:19.940 --> 2:24:21.940]  it's totally confirmed that it concerted effort
[2:24:21.940 --> 2:24:23.940]  from six major cities
[2:24:23.940 --> 2:24:25.940]  they sent testing kits into Italy
[2:24:25.940 --> 2:24:27.940]  they sent them here
[2:24:27.940 --> 2:24:29.940]  and they're sending in masks, use masks
[2:24:29.940 --> 2:24:31.940]  that the left in blue cities are delivering
[2:24:31.940 --> 2:24:33.940]  to people to spread it
[2:24:33.940 --> 2:24:35.940]  and
[2:24:35.940 --> 2:24:37.940]  here's why I'm sick
[2:24:37.940 --> 2:24:39.940]  I as a man we're entering
[2:24:39.940 --> 2:24:41.940]  a wheelhouse where you can't just sit around
[2:24:41.940 --> 2:24:43.940]  and talk about this on air
[2:24:43.940 --> 2:24:45.940]  and if Trump and the FBI
[2:24:45.940 --> 2:24:47.940]  doesn't move against the people doing this
[2:24:47.940 --> 2:24:49.940]  then
[2:24:51.940 --> 2:24:53.940]  what are we going to do
[2:24:53.940 --> 2:24:55.940]  what are we going to do
[2:24:57.940 --> 2:24:59.940]  this confirms the CHICOMS
[2:24:59.940 --> 2:25:01.940]  did this on purpose
[2:25:01.940 --> 2:25:03.940]  the good news is the senate intelligence committee
[2:25:03.940 --> 2:25:05.940]  has said that, the presidents telegraphed that
[2:25:05.940 --> 2:25:07.940]  they asked for the good cop, bad cop with them
[2:25:09.940 --> 2:25:11.940]  but when I got this new info
[2:25:11.940 --> 2:25:13.940]  and I said to Rob do
[2:25:15.940 --> 2:25:17.940]  let me guess who's behind it
[2:25:19.940 --> 2:25:21.940]  the latest company on record
[2:25:21.940 --> 2:25:23.940]  in England with the test
[2:25:23.940 --> 2:25:25.940]  the prickie on the finger it's got it in it
[2:25:25.940 --> 2:25:27.940]  that's in the news
[2:25:31.940 --> 2:25:33.940]  it'd be like
[2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:35.940]  people who are screaming in your house, the neighbors
[2:25:35.940 --> 2:25:37.940]  they call the cops, the cops pull up
[2:25:37.940 --> 2:25:39.940]  and you've got a bloody hatchet in your hand with blood all over you
[2:25:39.940 --> 2:25:41.940]  and your wife's
[2:25:41.940 --> 2:25:43.940]  hacked up, your husband's hacked up
[2:25:43.940 --> 2:25:45.940]  and then they go to
[2:25:45.940 --> 2:25:47.940]  surveillance footage
[2:25:47.940 --> 2:25:49.940]  because you did it in the parking lot or something
[2:25:49.940 --> 2:25:51.940]  and you're killing them
[2:25:51.940 --> 2:25:53.940]  I mean it's this obvious
[2:25:53.940 --> 2:25:55.940]  they rig it, they prepare it, they do it
[2:25:55.940 --> 2:25:57.940]  and then
[2:25:57.940 --> 2:25:59.940]  oh there are saviors, they're shipping and testing masks
[2:25:59.940 --> 2:26:01.940]  it's not China anymore, they're saving us
[2:26:01.940 --> 2:26:03.940]  and Chinese flee US
[2:26:03.940 --> 2:26:05.940]  all these Chinese that came here to bring it
[2:26:05.940 --> 2:26:07.940]  to incubate it
[2:26:07.940 --> 2:26:09.940]  and then now there's Chinese all over the internet
[2:26:09.940 --> 2:26:11.940]  celebrating how they did this to us
[2:26:11.940 --> 2:26:17.940]  oh America, literally America is finished, ha ha ha
[2:26:19.940 --> 2:26:21.940]  what is this footage, this is just so much
[2:26:21.940 --> 2:26:23.940]  it's information overload
[2:26:23.940 --> 2:26:25.940]  you know, something
[2:26:25.940 --> 2:26:27.940]  I'm not here to candy ass around
[2:26:27.940 --> 2:26:29.940]  in men's words
[2:26:29.940 --> 2:26:31.940]  and
[2:26:33.940 --> 2:26:35.940]  are we just going to let the robots
[2:26:35.940 --> 2:26:37.940]  replace us all
[2:26:37.940 --> 2:26:39.940]  the fighting men of the world
[2:26:39.940 --> 2:26:41.940]  who the globalist hate and compartmentalize
[2:26:43.940 --> 2:26:45.940]  you know you're being made obsolete
[2:26:45.940 --> 2:26:47.940]  you're not obsolete
[2:26:47.940 --> 2:26:49.940]  but they're making a world where you don't exist
[2:26:49.940 --> 2:26:51.940]  these technocrats
[2:26:51.940 --> 2:26:53.940]  and then they're pulling crap like this in front of everybody
[2:26:53.940 --> 2:26:55.940]  well they all run off
[2:26:55.940 --> 2:26:57.940]  and hide in their bunkers from the collapse they're creating
[2:26:57.940 --> 2:26:59.940]  and
[2:27:05.940 --> 2:27:07.940]  imagine the frustration for me
[2:27:07.940 --> 2:27:09.940]  and the chaos that's informed
[2:27:09.940 --> 2:27:11.940]  that do walks in here with articles
[2:27:15.940 --> 2:27:17.940]  and there it is
[2:27:17.940 --> 2:27:19.940]  mainstream news
[2:27:19.940 --> 2:27:21.940]  that the Chinese gave kits
[2:27:21.940 --> 2:27:23.940]  and that there's British firms that have other kits
[2:27:25.940 --> 2:27:27.940]  that are giving them COVID-19
[2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:29.940]  of course
[2:27:29.940 --> 2:27:31.940]  you don't just think they shot up
[2:27:31.940 --> 2:27:33.940]  tens of thousands of black men
[2:27:33.940 --> 2:27:35.940]  with syphilis
[2:27:35.940 --> 2:27:37.940]  so they could spread it all over the United States
[2:27:37.940 --> 2:27:39.940]  because they like us do you
[2:27:41.940 --> 2:27:43.940]  and I only mentioned Tuskegee because people know about Tuskegee
[2:27:45.940 --> 2:27:47.940]  you know there are tens of thousands of operations
[2:27:47.940 --> 2:27:49.940]  that are declassified that are just as bad
[2:27:51.940 --> 2:27:53.940]  but see they told you about the black people
[2:27:53.940 --> 2:27:55.940]  because they thought when they released that in the 70s
[2:27:55.940 --> 2:27:57.940]  been going on since the 30s
[2:27:57.940 --> 2:27:59.940]  that folks would say
[2:27:59.940 --> 2:28:01.940]  well they're just doing it to the black people
[2:28:01.940 --> 2:28:05.940]  see that that's the real subtle racism
[2:28:05.940 --> 2:28:07.940]  I don't care if they're black white or polka dotted
[2:28:07.940 --> 2:28:09.940]  when you shoot somebody up with syphilis
[2:28:09.940 --> 2:28:11.940]  you deserve to die
[2:28:11.940 --> 2:28:13.940]  but see oh well they're the medical experimenters
[2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:15.940]  and then Hillary apologized
[2:28:15.940 --> 2:28:17.940]  for doing it in Latin America
[2:28:17.940 --> 2:28:19.940]  oh I'm sorry
[2:28:19.940 --> 2:28:21.940]  as the head of the State Department
[2:28:21.940 --> 2:28:23.940]  I apologized
[2:28:23.940 --> 2:28:25.940]  that for 50 years
[2:28:25.940 --> 2:28:27.940]  we secretly injected
[2:28:27.940 --> 2:28:29.940]  people in Peru
[2:28:29.940 --> 2:28:31.940]  in Guatemala
[2:28:31.940 --> 2:28:33.940]  and Brazil
[2:28:33.940 --> 2:28:35.940]  with syphilis
[2:28:35.940 --> 2:28:37.940]  what a bunch of jerks man
[2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:41.940]  and if you think they've gotten better
[2:28:41.940 --> 2:28:43.940]  it's gotten worse
[2:28:43.940 --> 2:28:45.940]  and they've got a vaccine for you
[2:28:45.940 --> 2:28:47.940]  you ready to die cancer
[2:28:47.940 --> 2:28:49.940]  you ready to be sterilized
[2:28:49.940 --> 2:28:51.940]  you gotta murder you
[2:28:51.940 --> 2:28:53.940]  if you're trying to quit drinking
[2:28:53.940 --> 2:28:55.940]  or doing too many drugs
[2:28:55.940 --> 2:28:57.940]  listen to me
[2:28:57.940 --> 2:28:59.940]  you don't know me and we'll never meet
[2:28:59.940 --> 2:29:01.940]  I had a problem like you once
[2:29:01.940 --> 2:29:03.940]  I drank and used to party a little too much
[2:29:03.940 --> 2:29:05.940]  till it got out of control
[2:29:05.940 --> 2:29:07.940]  and almost ruined my life
[2:29:07.940 --> 2:29:09.940]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[2:29:09.940 --> 2:29:11.940]  before it totally destroyed me
[2:29:11.940 --> 2:29:13.940]  if you've tried to fix your drinking
[2:29:13.940 --> 2:29:15.940]  and drug problem

[2:30:55.940 --> 2:30:57.940]  listen
[2:30:57.940 --> 2:30:59.940]  there's a show from PBS
[2:30:59.940 --> 2:31:01.940]  called it's okay to be smart
[2:31:01.940 --> 2:31:03.940]  so everyone who's been smart
[2:31:03.940 --> 2:31:05.940]  and has been put down for it
[2:31:05.940 --> 2:31:07.940]  and persecuted
[2:31:07.940 --> 2:31:09.940]  it's okay to finally be smart
[2:31:09.940 --> 2:31:11.940]  that's right there's not two sexes
[2:31:11.940 --> 2:31:13.940]  and families are bad
[2:31:13.940 --> 2:31:15.940]  and the right thing to do is to sterilize
[2:31:15.940 --> 2:31:17.940]  your son so he doesn't become an evil warm hunger
[2:31:17.940 --> 2:31:19.940]  I mean a lot of feminists are saying we should have
[2:31:19.940 --> 2:31:21.940]  the government pass laws that mail embryos at count
[2:31:21.940 --> 2:31:23.940]  but what's better and more reformed
[2:31:23.940 --> 2:31:25.940]  and more humanitarian is to
[2:31:25.940 --> 2:31:27.940]  convince them when they're five years old
[2:31:27.940 --> 2:31:29.940]  to have their testicles chopped off
[2:31:29.940 --> 2:31:31.940]  and again global warming's real
[2:31:31.940 --> 2:31:33.940]  we gotta pay lord Rothschild all of our money
[2:31:33.940 --> 2:31:35.940]  and the pandemics all real
[2:31:35.940 --> 2:31:37.940]  we gotta be locked up in our houses
[2:31:37.940 --> 2:31:39.940]  we gotta use the language the universities say
[2:31:39.940 --> 2:31:41.940]  we're not a culture anything
[2:31:41.940 --> 2:31:43.940]  oh no, no we're not
[2:31:43.940 --> 2:31:45.940]  we're good people
[2:31:45.940 --> 2:31:47.940]  we're good people that went to these corporate systems
[2:31:47.940 --> 2:31:49.940]  that didn't brainwash us
[2:31:49.940 --> 2:31:51.940]  no, no, they enlightened us
[2:31:51.940 --> 2:31:53.940]  how to censor and how to rule and how to control
[2:31:53.940 --> 2:31:55.940]  biopqq
[2:31:55.940 --> 2:31:57.940]  research that

[2:32:03.940 --> 2:32:05.940]  researching coq10
[2:32:05.940 --> 2:32:07.940]  and then research dna force plus
[2:32:07.940 --> 2:32:09.940]  and the types that we have in here

[2:32:19.940 --> 2:32:21.940]  that are known to supercharge it all

[2:32:25.940 --> 2:32:27.940]  and I've told listeners

[2:33:25.940 --> 2:33:27.940]  it's in their mind
[2:33:27.940 --> 2:33:29.940]  it's what they want to see
[2:33:29.940 --> 2:33:31.940]  baby from the lady

[2:33:37.940 --> 2:33:39.940]  that's very important
[2:33:39.940 --> 2:33:41.940]  just during that break I was unable to get
[2:33:41.940 --> 2:33:43.940]  all the articles together I need
[2:33:43.940 --> 2:33:45.940]  nobody's fault
[2:33:45.940 --> 2:33:47.940]  but when I cover this
[2:33:47.940 --> 2:33:49.940]  next segment I'm going to be calm
[2:33:49.940 --> 2:33:51.940]  I'm going to be focused
[2:33:51.940 --> 2:33:53.940]  if these articles say a little prayer
[2:33:53.940 --> 2:33:55.940]  and
[2:33:55.940 --> 2:33:57.940]  then I'm going to come out here and present this
[2:33:57.940 --> 2:33:59.940]  it all just came together
[2:33:59.940 --> 2:34:01.940]  we already knew all this
[2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:03.940]  but red handed
[2:34:03.940 --> 2:34:05.940]  in every country
[2:34:05.940 --> 2:34:07.940]  the chinese sent
[2:34:07.940 --> 2:34:09.940]  testing kits contaminated with coronavirus
[2:34:09.940 --> 2:34:11.940]  on purpose
[2:34:11.940 --> 2:34:13.940]  and then we caught other companies
[2:34:13.940 --> 2:34:15.940]  admitted now
[2:34:15.940 --> 2:34:17.940]  that aren't from china
[2:34:17.940 --> 2:34:19.940]  funded by billa melinda gates doing the same thing
[2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:21.940]  he's a guy that releases mosquitoes
[2:34:21.940 --> 2:34:23.940]  in south america
[2:34:23.940 --> 2:34:25.940]  that give people zika
[2:34:25.940 --> 2:34:27.940]  look it up
[2:34:27.940 --> 2:34:29.940]  he says he wants to kill everybody
[2:34:29.940 --> 2:34:31.940]  and depopulate and get rid of old people
[2:34:31.940 --> 2:34:33.940]  in public but now he loves them
[2:34:33.940 --> 2:34:35.940]  we've got a lockdown forever to save the old people
[2:34:35.940 --> 2:34:37.940]  it's going to get real bad
[2:34:37.940 --> 2:34:39.940]  now I've got the stacks
[2:34:39.940 --> 2:34:41.940]  of articles here mainstream news
[2:34:41.940 --> 2:34:43.940]  hiding in plain view that the kits and the testings
[2:34:43.940 --> 2:34:45.940]  what's giving it to you
[2:34:45.940 --> 2:34:47.940]  in many cases
[2:34:47.940 --> 2:34:49.940]  that they don't want you to have the vitamins and minerals
[2:34:49.940 --> 2:34:51.940]  or drugs that could help you
[2:34:51.940 --> 2:34:53.940]  I mean
[2:34:53.940 --> 2:34:55.940]  this is it
[2:34:55.940 --> 2:34:57.940]  this is the globalist attack
[2:34:57.940 --> 2:34:59.940]  and trump understands that the public's been panicked
[2:34:59.940 --> 2:35:01.940]  so if he at first tried to fight it
[2:35:01.940 --> 2:35:03.940]  doesn't go along with some of it
[2:35:03.940 --> 2:35:05.940]  they'll drive him off
[2:35:05.940 --> 2:35:07.940]  and say he didn't help
[2:35:07.940 --> 2:35:09.940]  and then how do you go to everybody and say
[2:35:09.940 --> 2:35:11.940]  here it is in plain view they've launched the bio attack
[2:35:11.940 --> 2:35:13.940]  and foutsy saying
[2:35:13.940 --> 2:35:15.940]  we'll never leave marshal log in
[2:35:15.940 --> 2:35:17.940]  you're all going to get forced inoculations
[2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:21.940]  let's go ahead and air
[2:35:21.940 --> 2:35:23.940]  because this is a very powerful report
[2:35:23.940 --> 2:35:25.940]  and
[2:35:25.940 --> 2:35:27.940]  there was one little extra clip I wanted to add from B for Vendetta
[2:35:27.940 --> 2:35:29.940]  so this is a little bit of a different report than we aired
[2:35:29.940 --> 2:35:31.940]  at the end of the first hour
[2:35:31.940 --> 2:35:33.940]  the full report is up on infowars.com
[2:35:33.940 --> 2:35:35.940]  and band.video
[2:35:35.940 --> 2:35:37.940]  and it is titled
[2:35:37.940 --> 2:35:39.940]  B for Vendetta and the Coronavirus Endgame
[2:35:39.940 --> 2:35:41.940]  and if you're a radio listener
[2:35:41.940 --> 2:35:43.940]  you'll hear me talking on your TV
[2:35:43.940 --> 2:35:45.940]  your articles and documents and admissions
[2:35:45.940 --> 2:35:47.940]  on everything I say
[2:35:47.940 --> 2:35:49.940]  Rockefeller Foundation we're going to bring in
[2:35:49.940 --> 2:35:51.940]  an authoritarian world government
[2:35:51.940 --> 2:35:53.940]  they say authoritarian world government using this
[2:35:53.940 --> 2:35:55.940]  world leaders we're going to have a world government
[2:35:55.940 --> 2:35:57.940]  you have no more freedom
[2:35:57.940 --> 2:35:59.940]  it is not me saying it anymore
[2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:01.940]  it's here
[2:36:01.940 --> 2:36:03.940]  and then I'm going to control myself
[2:36:03.940 --> 2:36:05.940]  we come back after the break
[2:36:05.940 --> 2:36:07.940]  I'm going to present to you
[2:36:07.940 --> 2:36:09.940]  the devastating news
[2:36:09.940 --> 2:36:11.940]  the most insane garbage ever
[2:36:11.940 --> 2:36:16.780]  in plain view. This is the most incredible information ever revealed on this show. And
[2:36:16.780 --> 2:36:21.300]  it's in plain view because no one would imagine that the NIH and others would do this. That
[2:36:21.300 --> 2:36:26.020]  they do the secret testing. They were over all the radiating foster children to death
[2:36:26.020 --> 2:36:31.300]  and the mind control experiments and the injecting white people, black people, poor Native Americans
[2:36:31.300 --> 2:36:36.260]  with syphilis and HIV and everything else. And I'm going to show you mainstream news,
[2:36:36.260 --> 2:36:49.460]  how they did it all. And now they're doing it again. Monsters. Monsters. Monsters. But
[2:36:49.460 --> 2:36:53.500]  it's the scientific guild that got recruited by the hygienists. It's not the average, not
[2:36:53.500 --> 2:36:58.020]  the average FBI agent. It's not the average presidents aren't even in on this. The Kissinger
[2:36:58.020 --> 2:37:02.580]  wrote with them a random saying they were doing it under Nixon to depopulate the third
[2:37:02.580 --> 2:37:10.620]  world. I tainted medicines. What's that mean? Bayer with HIV. We're going to show it all
[2:37:10.620 --> 2:37:14.500]  to the aside, but here's part of this critical report that you must spread to everyone you
[2:37:14.500 --> 2:37:18.580]  know. Email, textbook, Facebook, everywhere. It's your right to do it. You have free speech
[2:37:18.580 --> 2:37:24.500]  still. Don't let them tell you you don't. Here it is. By the year 2020, there will be
[2:37:24.500 --> 2:37:48.100]  one world government. Rakers will 1999. In 2005, the Wachowski brothers produced the
[2:37:48.100 --> 2:37:57.260]  archetypal film V for Vendetta. And with almost prescient vision, they predicted what is unfolding
[2:37:57.260 --> 2:38:03.540]  in the year 2020. Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can. And then imagine
[2:38:03.540 --> 2:38:09.500]  that you and you alone have the cure. If your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such
[2:38:09.500 --> 2:38:17.260]  a weapon? A newly elected government seeking power and control develops a secret bio weapon
[2:38:17.260 --> 2:38:23.980]  and launches it against its own population to establish authoritarian rule and to blame
[2:38:23.980 --> 2:38:31.260]  the attack on their political enemies, taking pages right out of the 20th century. We see
[2:38:31.260 --> 2:38:37.220]  this fictional dictatorship, not just seeking to dominate and control their population, but
[2:38:37.220 --> 2:38:45.420]  to be seen as saviors of the very people that they are dumbing down, enslaving, imprisoning
[2:38:45.420 --> 2:38:54.020]  and killing. The writers had a deep historical well to work from in just the 20th century
[2:38:54.020 --> 2:39:01.540]  with monsters like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, Kim Jong
[2:39:01.540 --> 2:39:08.420]  Un, who don't just seek to dominate and control the very lives and thoughts of their minions,
[2:39:08.420 --> 2:39:13.500]  but who also want to be seen as the savior by the very people who are their slaves.
[2:39:13.500 --> 2:39:18.980]  Tonight I will speak directly to these people and make the situation perfectly clear to
[2:39:18.980 --> 2:39:25.620]  them. The security of this nation depends on complete and total compliance. What we need
[2:39:25.620 --> 2:39:30.860]  right now is a clear message to the people of this country. This message must be read
[2:39:30.860 --> 2:39:36.700]  in every newspaper heard on every radio seen on every television. This message must resound
[2:39:36.700 --> 2:39:41.620]  throughout the entire interlink. I want this country to realize that we stand on the edge
[2:39:41.620 --> 2:39:47.460]  of oblivion. I want every man, woman and child to understand how close we are to chaos. I
[2:39:47.460 --> 2:39:55.980]  want everyone to remember why they need us. In the former United States, civil war continues
[2:39:55.980 --> 2:40:00.420]  to devastate the Midwest. Scientists attribute this latest water shortage to the lack of
[2:40:00.420 --> 2:40:05.820]  rainfall the last two years. Ministry officials expect water coupon prices to rise. Police
[2:40:05.820 --> 2:40:13.460]  have arrested nine suspects. Can you believe this? Outside the quarantine zone, a new airborne
[2:40:13.460 --> 2:40:19.260]  pathogen has killed 27 people. So of course in the film, those that release the bio weapon
[2:40:19.260 --> 2:40:27.900]  on their own population that they're preying on also have the cure. Lo and behold, a miracle.
[2:40:27.900 --> 2:40:32.820]  Some believed it was the work of God himself that it was a pharmaceutical company controlled
[2:40:32.820 --> 2:40:38.620]  by certain party members that made them all obscenely rich. But the end result, the true
[2:40:38.620 --> 2:40:44.340]  genius of the plan was the fear. The fear became the ultimate tool of this government
[2:40:44.340 --> 2:40:48.900]  and through it, our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of
[2:40:48.900 --> 2:40:55.780]  the high chancellor. In V for Vendetta, we truly see art imitating life. But when you
[2:40:55.780 --> 2:41:03.860]  fast forward to the year 2019 and then 2020, it's not the US government that has its fingerprints
[2:41:03.860 --> 2:41:09.020]  all over this. It's the private corporate global government and they're testing ground
[2:41:09.020 --> 2:41:14.740]  the communist Chinese super state. Top scientists from across the world in India and Europe and
[2:41:14.740 --> 2:41:20.900]  other areas all came out early on and said this is clearly a man made coronavirus. This
[2:41:20.900 --> 2:41:28.620]  is clearly an offensive biological warfare agent. From the beginning of the entire event
[2:41:28.620 --> 2:41:33.780]  was carefully choreographed. Two years ago, the United Nations announces that disease
[2:41:33.780 --> 2:41:39.020]  X will soon arrive and that global government will be needed to counter the international
[2:41:39.020 --> 2:41:44.220]  crisis and that basic human liberties will have to be permanently erased in the name
[2:41:44.220 --> 2:41:50.060]  of global health. And then in the fall of 2019, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[2:41:50.060 --> 2:41:57.260]  holds event 201 where 65 million people die from a corona like virus. And the answer is
[2:41:57.260 --> 2:42:03.420]  quarantines, lockdowns, forced inoculations, robot drone enforcement, and of course, world
[2:42:03.420 --> 2:42:09.660]  government. From the beginning, the entire event was carefully choreographed. A man
[2:42:09.660 --> 2:42:15.420]  made virus designed to not just attack four different parts of the body, including male
[2:42:15.420 --> 2:42:22.140]  fertility and the lungs. But where did filmmakers like the Wachowski brothers get the idea
[2:42:22.140 --> 2:42:26.420]  for their script? Let's stop there. There's another five, six minutes of it. It's at band
[2:42:26.420 --> 2:42:30.900]  on video. It is beyond critical that you get that video. Email it word of mouth that Aaron
[2:42:30.900 --> 2:42:35.540]  on local radio shows just repost it on YouTube everywhere. Just don't put my name in it.
[2:42:35.540 --> 2:42:41.300]  You won't have any issues. Just get it out. The enemy thinks you're stupid. Also Bill
[2:42:41.300 --> 2:42:48.900]  and Melinda Gates had a company they run patent the vaccine virus in November as well. Of
[2:42:48.900 --> 2:43:00.100]  course. You have to look really hard at mainstream television news and print media and mainstream
[2:43:00.100 --> 2:43:05.340]  establishment media news sites to find it. I did extensive searches online with different
[2:43:05.340 --> 2:43:11.220]  search engines. I did a bunch of research looking at different TV archives and I couldn't
[2:43:11.220 --> 2:43:16.540]  find hardly anything except a couple local news stories with medical doctors on there
[2:43:16.540 --> 2:43:24.100]  talking about zinc, zinc, zinc, the element on the periodic table that is essential to
[2:43:24.100 --> 2:43:31.940]  life and that is the most anti viral natural compound out there in thousands and thousands
[2:43:31.940 --> 2:43:38.540]  of studies by the most prestigious universities, including big studies on the coronavirus
[2:43:38.540 --> 2:43:47.380]  family. So do yourself a favor, search engine, zinc and anti viral. Three words, zinc, anti
[2:43:47.380 --> 2:43:53.140]  viral, zinc, anti viral. Do yourself a favor, zinc, anti viral.
[2:43:53.140 --> 2:43:58.420]  We knew early on that COVID-19 was an engineered bio weapon. But again, people say, oh, then
[2:43:58.420 --> 2:44:03.420]  it must be the most deadly thing ever. No, it does currently kill people. But if you're
[2:44:03.420 --> 2:44:08.220]  going to release a bio weapon for fear and to bankrupt an economy and cause panic and
[2:44:08.220 --> 2:44:12.380]  to run folks off the edge of a cliff in a giant artificial stampede, you want to know
[2:44:12.380 --> 2:44:16.940]  the real trajectory, kill a bunch of old people, kill people that are deficient, kill people
[2:44:16.940 --> 2:44:21.500]  that are already sick, get rid of folks the globe who don't even want anyways, but scare
[2:44:21.500 --> 2:44:27.360]  everybody else you want to control into submission. And that's what's going on. So people get
[2:44:27.360 --> 2:44:30.900]  confused by the paradox of, you say it's a real virus, you say it's serious, but you
[2:44:30.900 --> 2:44:35.460]  say don't panic and don't shut the economy down. Exactly. Because if you do that, they're
[2:44:35.460 --> 2:44:40.180]  going to keep releasing bio weapons over and over again because it works so well on the
[2:44:40.180 --> 2:44:45.500]  public. Most people are starting to wake up, but we have to understand that pressures being
[2:44:45.500 --> 2:44:49.700]  put on Trump to basically keep the economy shut for another six months to a year. We'll
[2:44:49.700 --> 2:44:54.540]  be in a depression long before then. We've got to go back to work.
[2:44:54.540 --> 2:45:01.460]  The ultimate tyranny would be a nanny state that would not allow anyone to ever do anything
[2:45:01.460 --> 2:45:06.620]  that could possibly hurt them. And that's the globalist plan. And now Mr. Fauci at the
[2:45:06.620 --> 2:45:11.820]  NIH last night in the press conference standing right next to the president said, we're going
[2:45:11.820 --> 2:45:17.700]  to have a global lockdown because he talked to world leaders until not one more person
[2:45:17.700 --> 2:45:24.740]  is dying or one more person is infected. The video is posted on info wars.com. Ladies
[2:45:24.740 --> 2:45:29.660]  and gentlemen, that sets the precedent where not one person can die from the flu, not one
[2:45:29.660 --> 2:45:34.500]  person can die from a cold. Everyone will be surveilled in live time by their cell phones
[2:45:34.500 --> 2:45:41.340]  and apps and drones and an absolute straight jacket of pure medical tyranny. And remember
[2:45:41.340 --> 2:45:45.460]  it's big pharma that has a level four bio weapons labs that keeps leaking all these
[2:45:45.460 --> 2:45:51.460]  man made viruses. They're holding us all hostage. Oh, and he talked about forced
[2:45:51.460 --> 2:46:01.620]  inoculations. The virus and all of the hype is designed to destroy one thing, confidence.
[2:46:01.620 --> 2:46:07.140]  It's confidence in an economy, confidence in a culture, confidence in the direction
[2:46:07.140 --> 2:46:12.380]  of the civilization and the people are going that causes people to work hard and believe
[2:46:12.380 --> 2:46:18.220]  in the future and invest its spirit and the entire media and the entire culture and all
[2:46:18.220 --> 2:46:22.620]  these multinational governments and the UN, the WHO and the Chai comms in Hollywood have
[2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:32.620]  been having orgasmic delight over how plightly everyone has gotten into a state of fear. Yes,
[2:46:32.620 --> 2:46:36.820]  the virus is real. It's going to be maybe double what the flu is normally and it's
[2:46:36.820 --> 2:46:43.180]  a bio weapon. But a bio weapon, the globalist in the trajectory of, but it's real target
[2:46:43.180 --> 2:46:48.460]  is confidence in the economy. And that's why recognizing that it's an attempt to scare
[2:46:48.460 --> 2:46:57.420]  us in a submission is critical because then people will understand the real paradigm.
[2:46:57.420 --> 2:47:21.980]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones. We have some
[2:47:21.980 --> 2:47:26.980]  very great information to lay out. All the pieces fit perfectly together like a jigsaw
[2:47:26.980 --> 2:47:32.020]  and they admit what they've done and they have a long history of doing secret experimentation
[2:47:32.020 --> 2:47:38.100]  on first world, third world populations, white people, black people, brown people. There
[2:47:38.100 --> 2:47:42.540]  are thousands and thousands of declassified tests that the Department of Energy, the CDC
[2:47:42.540 --> 2:47:51.300]  and others did on poor appellation, white folks, poor Alabama black folks and just countless
[2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:55.380]  other incidences of this. So why would you trust these secretive groups that run level
[2:47:55.380 --> 2:48:03.180]  four bio weapons labs that came out of the eugenics movement in England 170 years ago?
[2:48:03.180 --> 2:48:08.100]  The Rockefeller Foundation and openly funded Hitler and Cold Springs Harbor and the Kaiser
[2:48:08.100 --> 2:48:13.660]  of Ilham Institute. And Bill Gates who says he wants to depopulate the earth and his dad
[2:48:13.660 --> 2:48:20.140]  was the head of the World Eugenics Organization and headed up Planned Parenthood. Why would
[2:48:20.140 --> 2:48:23.980]  you trust them when they say they want to get rid of the old people but now they want
[2:48:23.980 --> 2:48:29.940]  to save them by locking everybody down? It's come out and it's been the news for a week
[2:48:29.940 --> 2:48:35.780]  that China more than a week sent out contaminated masks and testing equipment and that people
[2:48:35.780 --> 2:48:41.700]  have gotten COVID-19 from what they shipped out and there's all these videos of their
[2:48:41.700 --> 2:48:47.140]  workers wiping their feet with the mask that are being sent to the United States and saying
[2:48:47.140 --> 2:48:51.060]  this is for America and Xi Jinping lets them do that. And there's all these new videos
[2:48:51.060 --> 2:48:56.540]  women saying, you know, we're here contaminating the thermometers to send them to you, ha ha ha.
[2:48:56.540 --> 2:49:03.020]  They make most of our medicine. You know that doesn't make sense. Xi Jinping admires dictators.
[2:49:03.020 --> 2:49:08.580]  He admires Hitler, Stalin and Mao on record. And his people, many of them are revolting
[2:49:08.580 --> 2:49:13.860]  against him but the others are buying into it and saying we're sending you contaminated
[2:49:13.860 --> 2:49:18.420]  masks. There's videos today of a woman in a factory, a manager saying we've done our
[2:49:18.420 --> 2:49:24.140]  job. We're sending the Americans a contaminated mask. When you look it up, masks are arriving
[2:49:24.140 --> 2:49:38.100]  from China in rescue planes to Los Angeles and now the mayor is saying you will be ordered
[2:49:38.100 --> 2:49:46.180]  to wear masks from China. Oh, now we understand. So we have all of this and I'm going to show
[2:49:46.180 --> 2:49:52.300]  you mainstream news hiding in plain view. We're not just companies getting Chinese equipment,
[2:49:52.300 --> 2:49:58.820]  but the NIH, the CDC and companies in the UK funded by wait for it, the same folks that
[2:49:58.820 --> 2:50:03.500]  patented the virus last year, the same ones that had the drill of 65 million dead from
[2:50:03.500 --> 2:50:08.460]  a coronavirus, the same ones that are worshiped as the saviors for prescience Bill and Melinda
[2:50:08.460 --> 2:50:19.020]  Gates Foundation. Axios, scoop, lab for coronaviruses, test kits may have been contaminated. A federal
[2:50:19.020 --> 2:50:23.740]  scientist sounded alarm about what he feared was contamination with coronavirus and Atlanta
[2:50:23.740 --> 2:50:28.300]  lab where the government made test kits for coronavirus according to sources familiar
[2:50:28.300 --> 2:50:32.940]  with the situation in Atlanta. Oh, they want to prick you with it. It's just an accident
[2:50:32.940 --> 2:50:39.660]  that some got on the needle. Driving the news, the Trump administration has ordered an independent
[2:50:39.660 --> 2:50:44.260]  investigation of the Centers for Disease Control Prevention lab and manufacturer of the virus
[2:50:44.260 --> 2:50:50.020]  test kits has been moved sources said, Oh, well, that's just one place. Here's another
[2:50:50.020 --> 2:50:54.500]  one Los Angeles mayor says all residents should wear masks. Now it's going to be fines. Texas
[2:50:54.500 --> 2:51:03.420]  town just passed a law. Continuing. Ladies and gentlemen, China gave faulty contaminated
[2:51:03.420 --> 2:51:09.820]  COVID-19 equipment to several countries. Nationalfall.com that links to AP Reuters and how they sent
[2:51:09.820 --> 2:51:13.500]  them to the Australian board and how they sent them to Italy and how they just sent
[2:51:13.500 --> 2:51:18.460]  them all over the place. Video Chinese woman brags about buying truckloads of face masks
[2:51:18.460 --> 2:51:25.780]  from the US markets. Now they're shipping them back used. UK attempts to ramp up coronavirus
[2:51:25.780 --> 2:51:31.420]  testing hindered as key components contaminated with the virus. Oh, and this is in the one
[2:51:31.420 --> 2:51:36.820]  that independent. It's in the Daily Mail. It's in it's in the Guardian. Britain's attempt
[2:51:36.820 --> 2:51:41.060]  to ramp up mass coronavirus testing has been dealt to blow after key components ordered
[2:51:41.060 --> 2:51:46.700]  from overseas were discovered to be contaminated with Corona viruses. Oh, how accidental. You
[2:51:46.700 --> 2:51:53.820]  got a wipe and check and you're bad. Stay in your house. But the equipment just so happens
[2:51:53.820 --> 2:52:01.980]  to all be dripping with it. Oh, my goodness. Isn't China nice sending us all those masks
[2:52:01.980 --> 2:52:05.500]  and all those little needles to prick our fingers with like the little spindle wheel
[2:52:05.500 --> 2:52:11.460]  and what happened in sleeping beauty on your 16th birthday. You will prick your finger
[2:52:11.460 --> 2:52:19.940]  in a golden spinning wheel and die. One of the suppliers Luxembourg based film, Eurofins
[2:52:19.940 --> 2:52:24.460]  to an email on Monday morning to government laboratories, the UK warning, the delivery
[2:52:24.460 --> 2:52:32.780]  of key components called probes and primers. Oh, little needles had been contaminated with
[2:52:32.780 --> 2:52:40.260]  the Corona virus. But you stay in your house. We got some special. You're gonna get tested
[2:52:40.260 --> 2:52:44.020]  though. We're going to show you a man being held down and tested the moment he's being
[2:52:44.020 --> 2:52:51.020]  given the gift. Yeah, this isn't a science fiction movie. You're in it. These folks funded
[2:52:51.020 --> 2:52:56.780]  Hitler, Stalin and Mao. You ready to die? I don't say that scary. I think you're men
[2:52:56.780 --> 2:53:00.980]  and women out there. I think you're gonna speak out and wake up. The whole government's
[2:53:00.980 --> 2:53:07.260]  not involved. This is a very small cult committing crimes so massive that they think no one
[2:53:07.260 --> 2:53:11.180]  will believe they're doing it. It's in plain view. There's another one. These are all
[2:53:11.180 --> 2:53:20.460]  mainstream news. Eurofins North America purchases contract analytical lab craft technologies.
[2:53:20.460 --> 2:53:29.580]  And they are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. That's right. Eurofins
[2:53:29.580 --> 2:53:35.140]  North America food division acquired craft technologies in a contract laboratory that
[2:53:35.140 --> 2:53:42.140]  specializes in analysis of nutrients, vitamins, bioflavonoids, pharmaceuticals and received
[2:53:42.140 --> 2:53:46.100]  available in the Gates Foundation grant for developing analytical methods. Isn't that
[2:53:46.100 --> 2:53:51.660]  nice? Just like Fauci got 100 million. There's didn't one grant. US intelligence report
[2:53:51.660 --> 2:53:56.780]  concludes China concealed the extent of the Corona virus outbreak. Chinese firm offers
[2:53:56.780 --> 2:54:05.420]  replace faulty test kits sold to Spain, which helps spread it of course. That's in Bloomberg.
[2:54:05.420 --> 2:54:11.340]  But don't worry. The US medical stockpiles nearly out of protective gear. Reuters reports
[2:54:11.340 --> 2:54:17.900]  as demand rises. But look who's helping. A million in 95 master coming from China on
[2:54:17.900 --> 2:54:24.100]  board the new England Patriots play. Yeah. And more coming to LA. And it's the law you
[2:54:24.100 --> 2:54:32.020]  put them on. Put your mask on. Corona's coming. Oh, and I've got all the stacks of the UN
[2:54:32.020 --> 2:54:37.980]  caught putting HIV hepatitis in the vaccines all over the world, especially Africa. They
[2:54:37.980 --> 2:54:45.300]  do love black people with the UN. So and all the CEOs before all this started in December
[2:54:45.300 --> 2:54:50.060]  January dumping the biggest dump ever of insider trading and senators to. But that's okay.
[2:54:50.060 --> 2:54:54.700]  Oh, but don't worry. The UN fights against forced sterilization. They run the organization
[2:54:54.700 --> 2:55:00.460]  over it and they run the group stopping pedophilia because they run that. It's like having Count
[2:55:00.460 --> 2:55:06.460]  Dracula be the anti, you know, vampire detective. Count Dracula would tell you Von Helsing was
[2:55:06.460 --> 2:55:11.300]  the bad guy and probably getting banned off Google. Let's continue. Corona virus testing
[2:55:11.300 --> 2:55:18.660]  delayed after kits found to be contaminated by COVID-19. That's the Daily Mail and I've
[2:55:18.660 --> 2:55:26.540]  got others here. Isn't it cute? Oh, more. Oh, it's more, more, more. But let's get into
[2:55:26.540 --> 2:55:34.100]  some of the past. U.S. apologizes for Guatemalan STD experiments giving thousands and thousands.
[2:55:34.100 --> 2:55:40.540]  Things like syphilis and letting them spread it all NBC. Giving telling them we're giving
[2:55:40.540 --> 2:55:49.300]  you medicine a vaccine. But it's COVID-19 doctors. You in vaccines in Kenya used to sterilize
[2:55:49.300 --> 2:55:52.820]  women doctors from around the world tested the vaccines and found they had a hormone
[2:55:52.820 --> 2:55:57.940]  added to it that second stage of pregnancy. Second trimester causes spontaneous abortions
[2:55:57.940 --> 2:56:07.540]  in 100% of women killing the baby. Oh, loving liberals. Oh, here's another one. Polio vaccines
[2:56:07.540 --> 2:56:14.540]  laced with sterilizing hormone discovered in Kenya. World Health Organization. Oh, loving.
[2:56:14.540 --> 2:56:18.300]  Daily Caller Clinton Foundation AIDS program distributed water down drugs in third world
[2:56:18.300 --> 2:56:23.540]  countries and they were contaminated. Oh, blood money bears inventory of HIV contaminated
[2:56:23.540 --> 2:56:29.820]  blood products and third world hemophiliacs. Oh, that's a big national study. Bear admits
[2:56:29.820 --> 2:56:34.940]  it paid millions in HIV infection cases, knowingly put it in all of their factor eight protein
[2:56:34.940 --> 2:56:39.140]  product. And they had documents that the head guys said, Well, there's too many hemophiliacs
[2:56:39.140 --> 2:56:44.380]  liberal. The Clinton Foundation dodgy record with other drugs, Bayer Division only sold
[2:56:44.380 --> 2:56:51.500]  HIV infected protein, the Guardian. Oh my gosh. Oh, that's just a small smattering for
[2:56:51.500 --> 2:57:01.300]  you. They would never give anybody COVID-19. So the big pharma that funds all the NIH people,
[2:57:01.300 --> 2:57:04.660]  the revolving door, got total power and a total takeover and total martial off forever
[2:57:04.660 --> 2:57:11.100]  and total surveillance and drones. And oh, no, but they are. And I need you to spread
[2:57:11.100 --> 2:57:14.220]  the word about this because I know when I've been at the danger zone and I'm not backing
[2:57:14.220 --> 2:57:18.380]  down like everybody else. Everybody else just kind of backing down right now. I'm not backing
[2:57:18.380 --> 2:57:22.980]  down. So if anything happens to me, just continue to work on. And we're all dead anyways, if
[2:57:22.980 --> 2:57:29.260]  they win. So I'm not losing anything. I'm gaining everything. All right. So that I not
[2:57:29.260 --> 2:57:33.900]  be counted amongst those timid souls that serve Satan. Also, you want to fund this operation

[2:58:44.180 --> 2:58:49.420]  I don't want to sit here and say, see, I told you so. So people say, oh, Alex Jones is so
[2:58:49.420 --> 2:58:55.180]  smart. Oh, he's so great. I can hear less about that. I want you to understand that
[2:58:55.180 --> 2:59:01.700]  back in mid-January during a whole fake impeachment fiasco and the rest of it, I was pointing
[2:59:01.700 --> 2:59:06.820]  out that the biggest issue would be the next move, the next attack. The Globals were in
[2:59:06.820 --> 2:59:10.540]  a launch. They knew they didn't have the votes back then. And I said it would be an attack
[2:59:10.540 --> 2:59:16.180]  on the economy because criminals loved to brag and they were telegraphing the entire
[2:59:16.180 --> 2:59:21.580]  thing. And now here we are, ladies and gentlemen, our economy shut down for over a month. Certain
[2:59:21.580 --> 2:59:27.780]  depression if it continues for more than a month and a half or so, maybe even shorter.
[2:59:27.780 --> 2:59:32.780]  And Americans have failed the test. They have gotten into the fear. They've enjoyed not going
[2:59:32.780 --> 2:59:39.300]  into work. It's been a new drama. And the Globals were saying, hell, let's destroy their way
[2:59:39.300 --> 2:59:42.620]  of life forever. Let's kill their confidence and give them a depression. People better
[2:59:42.620 --> 2:59:58.900]  wake up now.
[2:59:58.900 --> 3:00:04.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live. It has now been confirmed in scores
[3:00:04.340 --> 3:00:13.140]  and news articles and major labs that China ship contaminated equipment with COVID-19
[3:00:13.140 --> 3:00:17.980]  on the test that they use even prick your fingers and that it's spreading COVID-19 all
[3:00:17.980 --> 3:00:23.100]  over the world. And they're shipping use mask back into the US to save us. And the Democrat
[3:00:23.100 --> 3:00:29.380]  mayors are ordering them handed out from Seattle to Los Angeles to DC to New York.
[3:00:29.380 --> 3:00:33.580]  And you will wear your Chinese dirty mask. I'm not kidding. We're about to lay it all
[3:00:33.580 --> 3:00:41.700]  out right now. And the exclusive video just now coming out of people being literally grabbed
[3:00:41.700 --> 3:00:48.220]  and held down and blood tested. Oh, I bet it's one of those contaminated faulty tests
[3:00:48.220 --> 3:00:54.900]  from China. Well, yeah, why send somebody a real test or just sending them COVID-19?
[3:00:54.900 --> 3:00:58.260]  That's how bio attacks work and the deep states working with them because the deep state but
[3:00:58.260 --> 3:01:03.420]  the chai comms in power. This is huge. Earthshaking news. We've laid out the facts. We're going
[3:01:03.420 --> 3:01:10.100]  to lay it out now in detail. But here is the latest footage of a man who the medical tyrants
[3:01:10.100 --> 3:01:13.580]  are about to forcibly hold down and take blood from. Here it is.
[3:01:13.580 --> 3:01:34.340]  I didn't tell you get on the bed. I'm not getting on the bed. It doesn't work like that, bro.
[3:01:34.340 --> 3:02:00.900]  I don't want to leave it on. It don't work like that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[3:02:00.900 --> 3:02:14.080]  no, no, no. Time is now. The time is now. No. I'm not on drugs. None of it, bro. I'm
[3:02:14.080 --> 3:02:16.080]  Yeah
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:03:04.080]  Oh
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:30.080]  Oh
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:37.800]  And that's what this is all about is causing a revolution the breakdown of society and one of my friends was saying during the break when the crew here
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:42.600]  What we're seeing in China. Yeah, let's roll some of that b-roll people being regular houses in China
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:46.480]  I really want to do that while I'm talking. Thank you. Um, we were talking during the break
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:53.960]  About how China sets the precedent they cover up the virus they ship all the contaminated stuff over here in a bio attack
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:56.400]  And we hear there's gonna be this big reckoning
[3:03:57.160 --> 3:04:01.480]  By the Senate Intelligence Committee and the rest of the Trump stuff. They're saying oh, I like gg ping playing the part of the
[3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:03.480]  Good cop for PR purposes
[3:04:03.720 --> 3:04:09.400]  When does China get in trouble for this? Why are they the boss over the World Health Organization and why are they the ones telling us?
[3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:18.800]  how to live our lives because they're an authoritarian state that the globalist love or they can do anything they want any time they want and
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:21.960]  Now they've locked the country down again for coronavirus and now we're told by Fauci
[3:04:21.960 --> 3:04:27.120]  It's gonna be happening every year now and we're gonna have apps on our phones to be tracked everything we told you
[3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:32.000]  And the Chinese are busy wiping their shoes with the mask and shipping them here
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:36.720]  And the Democrat mayors are ordering as the aircraft lands with the Chinese mask. You will wear them
[3:04:36.720 --> 3:04:43.240]  Ha ha because the left literally wants feces and needles homeless everywhere and their cities collapsing
[3:04:43.240 --> 3:04:49.400]  This is the takeover. This is flowered in heaven. This is 21st century warfare. This is the new world order

[3:06:08.400 --> 3:06:10.400]  We knew it from the start
[3:06:12.040 --> 3:06:14.040]  I see
[3:06:15.040 --> 3:06:17.540]  You can feel it from my heart
[3:06:19.600 --> 3:06:21.600]  From here on after
[3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:26.600]  It was about the way we are right now. I don't know 35 years ago
[3:06:27.600 --> 3:06:29.440]  I began to read
[3:06:29.440 --> 3:06:31.440]  government documents reports
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:36.560]  Books because it was so entertaining. It was much more interesting. I read a Zygian Brzezinski book when I was 12 years old
[3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:41.520]  About how he fed funded pull pot to kill millions of people and I was so proud of it
[3:06:41.520 --> 3:06:45.560]  And how the government ran the organized crime so they could control it
[3:06:46.440 --> 3:06:48.440]  Then reading a comic book or something
[3:06:48.440 --> 3:06:56.560]  You read all these PhD level books. It's all just how they're gods and you're all animals and how you're scum
[3:06:56.560 --> 3:06:58.560]  You know, we had that
[3:06:58.600 --> 3:07:06.240]  Doctor medical worker at the time on who was in the army and how they saw the troops as guinea pigs to just use and do experimental
[3:07:07.320 --> 3:07:11.240]  Stuff on I mean, that's how they see you and it's them
[3:07:11.880 --> 3:07:15.760]  It's the medical world that is the most elitist and evil
[3:07:15.760 --> 3:07:17.760]  Because
[3:07:18.880 --> 3:07:24.040]  Thomas Malthus wrote the book 250 years ago for modern Western medicine
[3:07:25.040 --> 3:07:31.160]  And he got his ideas from Plato who believed you should put poor people in inner cities and release plagues on them to kill them and
[3:07:32.240 --> 3:07:34.560]  Malthus said do that look it up. It's in the encyclopedia
[3:07:35.560 --> 3:07:41.840]  And so you see Bill Gates hopping around. Oh, I'm gonna save you when he's normally saying kill everybody and he populate
[3:07:41.840 --> 3:07:45.520]  And he's giggling and laughing at Ted TV about reducing world population
[3:07:46.160 --> 3:07:49.880]  Down to zero and they all laugh when he shows an equation of how to do it
[3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:55.960]  There's one thing psychotics do and that's brag about what they're doing to you
[3:07:57.080 --> 3:07:59.800]  You know, you see movies and stuff for the villain
[3:08:01.360 --> 3:08:05.400]  Lex Luthor has Superman tied up with Kryptonite and he's like bragging to him about his master plan
[3:08:05.400 --> 3:08:06.760]  That's I think my kid
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:10.520]  Why would the villain always wait and talk about their plan? They actually do it
[3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:16.000]  See, they like to tell you how they're gonna do it in a prestigious publication in really fancy language
[3:08:16.200 --> 3:08:18.200]  It's fine print. It's metaphysical
[3:08:18.520 --> 3:08:22.840]  But then be your savior and get you to opt in so they can kill you
[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:30.600]  So here's the Daily Mail CDC lab for coronavirus test kits may have been contaminated then you read it is contaminated
[3:08:30.600 --> 3:08:35.960]  They took it from China and the Bill O Melinda Gates Foundation is involved boy. Isn't that just amazing?
[3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:41.440]  You read these articles and they all say is contaminated, but the headline is maybe it's coming
[3:08:41.440 --> 3:08:47.920]  Oh coronavirus might hurt male fertility. You read the study if you get a big outbreak of it and it spreads and you don't have
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:54.680]  All the building blocks to defeat it like the NIH says you got to have zinc and and D3
[3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:58.280]  And you got to have vitamin C if you're deficient in that virus has run wild
[3:08:59.440 --> 3:09:03.200]  I'm just in if you don't have vitamin C you die in about five months
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:07.560]  Yes, your skin opens up your teeth fall out. You bleed out your ass till you die
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:16.240]  But see they're all over the news with Bill Bill O Melinda Gates and everybody funding groups
[3:09:16.640 --> 3:09:22.720]  TV shows about me saying Jones is wrong. Don't take supplements. They'll kill you on the show the good doctor
[3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:30.520]  And I saw and I said Bill Gates funded that went and looked at it the director and producer Bill Gates's works for him and Bill Gates funded
[3:09:30.520 --> 3:09:37.120]  He was on MSNBC the other day. I go look Bill Gates paid for this and my wife goes. How do you know that?
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:43.080]  I said, what's the MS sweetheart? It's Microsoft. You think I just make this stuff up
[3:09:44.360 --> 3:09:48.040]  You think I'm just talking about this mass murder because I want to play games
[3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:54.320]  He's killing my name right now and financing most of this crap against with Bloomberg
[3:09:54.320 --> 3:10:00.800]  Because he's got to destroy my name before he kills me. Fine. I don't care. I want everybody to understand something. I
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:04.400]  Didn't exaggerate or make any of this up
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:11.840]  Hitler sent tanks into countries people could fight that they could see it you can't fight
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:20.600]  People that are your saviors who are really behind the bio weapon until you grow up and admit it China doesn't do this on their own
[3:10:20.600 --> 3:10:25.360]  They're doing it with the globalist deep state and the UN against us and against Trump
[3:10:26.320 --> 3:10:32.680]  And I'm not here kissing Trump's ass. He goes against America people all turn on him in zero seconds instantly
[3:10:32.680 --> 3:10:34.120]  That's not what's happening
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:40.400]  We're the ones who told Trump he better get ahead of this and say it's a problem because Americans are cowards and are scared and
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:45.920]  Are stupid on average now and love being in fear and being politically correct in virtue signaling
[3:10:45.920 --> 3:10:52.840]  And they'll walk right into a depression. So Trump had to act with him and be the leader of the BS
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:10:58.600]  So he can divert it and he's doing that. He's like, we'll open the 14 days. No, no, we're all dead
[3:10:58.640 --> 3:11:01.880]  Okay, we'll open in April. We'll at the end of April
[3:11:03.040 --> 3:11:09.400]  We can't hold on much longer than that and this is to destroy America and destroy the West and bring in a world
[3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:16.400]  UN tyranny managing everything with virus threats and third world population surges and replacement migration
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:18.400]  How do I know it's in all their admissions?
[3:11:23.920 --> 3:11:26.600]  I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna hand the baton to Matt Bracken. I
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:37.720]  Know this stuff sounds fantastical and insane because it's the reality
[3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:42.880]  Now
[3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:48.200]  Within a year, you're all gonna have to have apps on your phones to go outside if Trump doesn't reverse this and it's never gonna
[3:11:48.200 --> 3:11:53.600]  End thoughts. He said that the answer is while you still can get your ass to outside a town
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:58.240]  Wherever you have to everybody better stop caring about lifestyle and a bunch of extra crap
[3:11:58.240 --> 3:12:03.720]  And you better get to a place that has well water and high ground and you better just get away from the system
[3:12:03.720 --> 3:12:09.040]  If you can because it's all over. It's all over. Let me explain. It's all over. You're dead
[3:12:09.080 --> 3:12:14.840]  You understand that they're gonna murder you with the vaccines and the chemicals and the binary weapons
[3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:19.840]  Period don't know what a binary weapon is you better find out real quick and that's a simple way of saying it
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:26.160]  They actually have it where they'll add like remember the Joker always like to put one poison in the water supply
[3:12:26.160 --> 3:12:29.600]  But then only if you bought us cosmetics when it kill you that's a binary weapon
[3:12:30.920 --> 3:12:35.800]  Of course the 5g's part of it in studies it resonates and destroys your immune system
[3:12:37.400 --> 3:12:44.200]  And you all instinctively know that already this is all real folks. This is all real. This is the big challenge
[3:12:44.800 --> 3:12:45.880]  Okay
[3:12:45.880 --> 3:12:50.680]  So listen, yeah, great five vitamins and minerals for me. Yeah, great get water filtration from us
[3:12:50.680 --> 3:12:54.320]  Yeah, I get swarable food from us. We have it again. Great money and funder operation
[3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:59.600]  I just want to hold up and stay on air as long as I can to warn people. I don't give a damn about being on air
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:02.880]  I don't give a damn about a big house. I don't give a damn about any of this
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:06.920]  I have been sitting here staying in this you in overrun hell
[3:13:07.200 --> 3:13:11.720]  Austin around all these mummies and Satanists and chicken crap people
[3:13:11.720 --> 3:13:15.800]  Knowing I had to hold this place as long as possible till they pulled all their crap
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:19.640]  Which was coming 1 trillion percent as I told you I control bio weapon
[3:13:20.880 --> 3:13:27.520]  So none of the crap matters none of it you get it you were weak you were Satanist you aborted all the babies you love it
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:29.200]  They're gonna kill you
[3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:32.480]  So now all that matters is people that want to get away from it
[3:13:32.480 --> 3:13:38.160]  And they're gonna bring the white vans two three years from now and the troops to forcibly inoculate you your kids are gonna have
[3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:43.440]  Convulsions a week later your balls are gonna fall off. It's just it's war. It's war. They're coming to kill you
[3:13:43.440 --> 3:13:47.400]  So that's it and it's all peer pressure the cops and the military
[3:13:47.400 --> 3:13:56.200]  They're all just everybody else is swept up in the peer pressure and the cowardice and the followers spirit of weakness because America's soul is gone
[3:13:57.560 --> 3:14:03.320]  Now America's soul was coming back and that's why they did this and it could still come back now
[3:14:03.320 --> 3:14:10.800]  But subserving and getting into all of it is the creed of slaves and these aren't like the Romans that just want to put you out on a
[3:14:11.040 --> 3:14:13.040]  plantation
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:19.320]  They want you dead in game blueprint for global enslavement they want you dead
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:21.880]  That's on a shortwave radio. I've got it my house
[3:14:22.600 --> 3:14:24.600]  Little green sticker for promotion from it
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:30.400]  They want you dead ladies and gentlemen
[3:14:30.400 --> 3:14:33.120]  I don't know how else to explain this to you
[3:14:33.920 --> 3:14:38.040]  It's a system that targets old people that Bill Gates says he wants to kill and your balls
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:43.480]  And if they can't trick people to sterilize their sons because it's the new fashion thing
[3:14:43.640 --> 3:14:49.320]  They'll sterilize your ass with a souped up COVID-19 and yeah, it's a real virus and you're not gonna get away from it
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:53.080]  They're putting it in everything you
[3:14:53.080 --> 3:14:59.960]  Enjoy yourselves you hey you're like that baby that never got to live and they pump that
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:05.520]  That acid in there or that salt and that baby burns the death and excruciating pain over two days
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:10.240]  You're gonna be a lot luster in that baby. So just be happy. You didn't stand up for the baby. You're dead
[3:15:10.280 --> 3:15:13.200]  You're gonna get tortured. You're gonna get medical experiments
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:19.120]  Just like the black people in Tuskegee dying for 45 years with syphilis and giving it to hundreds of thousands
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:23.800]  You're gonna be tortured to death just like those babies. So enjoy it
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:32.120]  Hope you all enjoy yourselves all the games are over all your candy ass craps over all your fake Hollywood trash is over

[3:20:07.680 --> 3:20:10.520]  All right, Matt Bracken, it's about to take over.
[3:20:10.520 --> 3:20:16.640]  I want to be totally clear. Alex Jones, you're back live. When I'm telling
[3:20:16.640 --> 3:20:20.440]  people you're going to hell, you need to dive, we need to do the babies. It's all
[3:20:20.440 --> 3:20:24.440]  coming back on you. I'm talking about the decadent slime on all those videos we
[3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:29.160]  aired this year and last year. Dozens of them, of just comedians and Democrats
[3:20:29.160 --> 3:20:33.440]  saying I love killing babies and Twitter promoting the sexual fetus that I never
[3:20:33.440 --> 3:20:38.120]  even heard of about where people like to kill their baby and talk about it.
[3:20:38.120 --> 3:20:43.400]  Satanism. Those are the people I'm talking about. I mean, they are going to be the
[3:20:43.400 --> 3:20:47.680]  first that are gobbled up by this system. But we played the footage earlier of a
[3:20:47.680 --> 3:20:52.160]  man reportedly being forcibly having his blood taken. Those aren't the ones that
[3:20:52.160 --> 3:20:56.240]  give you the COVID-19. It's the prick ones from China, the little test kits
[3:20:56.240 --> 3:21:01.560]  that are contaminated. That's in the news. Wow. And they're masked. At the end, he
[3:21:01.560 --> 3:21:04.360]  says, this is going to be a revolution. They go, oh, they're laughing at him
[3:21:04.360 --> 3:21:09.560]  because this is the medical tyranny revolution. This is the NIH level four
[3:21:09.560 --> 3:21:13.000]  bio weapon revolution where they can hold us hostage with bio weapons and
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:16.040]  control our lives. How many science fiction books do they learn about?
[3:21:16.040 --> 3:21:19.600]  Human society went underground because of the threat of bio weapons. What they
[3:21:19.600 --> 3:21:25.080]  didn't know was the scientific elite releasing them. That's THX1138, folks.
[3:21:25.080 --> 3:21:29.920]  That's Brave New World. They've all, all this Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley,
[3:21:29.920 --> 3:21:36.120]  ran the UN eugenics program. He ran UNESCO. And his brother wrote a book in 61
[3:21:36.120 --> 3:21:40.280]  before he died. All this Huxley's saying, it's all real. And you can go listen to
[3:21:40.280 --> 3:21:43.960]  him at Berkeley. It's an hour-long speech at Berkeley. Admit it's all a real plan.
[3:21:43.960 --> 3:21:48.680]  Brave New World published in 32 that sounds like what's happening now was the
[3:21:48.680 --> 3:21:56.400]  plan. And so everybody can comply and get into the virus and get all scared. The
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:21:59.600]  virus is real, but the hype and what they're doing and the idea that we can
[3:21:59.600 --> 3:22:02.720]  never allow anyone to die, like Fauci said last night, that we'll end the
[3:22:02.720 --> 3:22:09.040]  lockdown when no one's dying, not one person, is the creed of slaves. And we'll
[3:22:09.040 --> 3:22:14.320]  never stop. They can't have a vaccine for the common cold. It's impossible. Just
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:18.000]  like the flu. It's all made up crap on record. They say, oh, take Jones off air.
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:24.080]  He's putting out disinformation. Oh yeah, like Hydra. Like those, all the drugs
[3:22:24.080 --> 3:22:28.960]  they've now approved. Hydroxychloric, when the rest of it, it's all crap. Remember,
[3:22:28.960 --> 3:22:32.000]  mainstream media's been telling you for months, zinc doesn't help you. Vitamin C
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:35.240]  doesn't help you. Vitamin D doesn't help you. Hydroxychloric, nothing helps you.
[3:22:35.240 --> 3:22:40.600]  Nothing helps you, but nothing helps you. Folks, I can tell you, I'd already told
[3:22:40.600 --> 3:22:44.560]  you months ago, we got the studio here still in Austin. People say, why do you
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:46.800]  live in Austin? Well, my mom's from here, family from here. I'm from, you know,
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:52.400]  Dallas. I mean, my family's been here, but since before it was a state. And they're
[3:22:52.400 --> 3:22:58.640]  all from Texas. In fact, my second wife's the only person in my family not from
[3:22:58.640 --> 3:23:01.520]  Texas. We never did that on purpose. Everybody has been married to somebody
[3:23:01.520 --> 3:23:06.280]  from Texas, nine generations. I mean, I never make a big deal about it, but I
[3:23:06.280 --> 3:23:14.320]  mean, my family, Colonel Travis, whole nine yards. Look it up. You know, just the
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:16.960]  whole nine yards. I'm not going to go through it. It's ridiculous because it's
[3:23:16.960 --> 3:23:19.840]  about what I do, not about who my ancestors were, the Revolutionary War or
[3:23:19.840 --> 3:23:28.480]  any of it. But Austin's overrun. It's gone. It's worse than LA. And the
[3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:31.520]  country is screwed up. And we have to admit how bad it is. And we have to
[3:23:31.520 --> 3:23:34.760]  totally withdraw from anything leftist. None of their movies, none of their
[3:23:34.760 --> 3:23:38.200]  banks, none of their culture. You don't talk to them when they're a Democrat or
[3:23:38.200 --> 3:23:40.880]  you tell them, you tell them, you know they're evil and you have to shun them
[3:23:40.880 --> 3:23:43.680]  like they try to shun us because we're the producers that they know it. And they
[3:23:43.680 --> 3:23:48.560]  want to dominate us because they are spiritual succubus. We must come out of
[3:23:48.560 --> 3:23:52.680]  Babylon, but I am going to move out of Austin. I went and looked at a place
[3:23:52.680 --> 3:23:59.920]  yesterday, 35 miles outside Austin and I will phase out and even being here. I
[3:23:59.920 --> 3:24:04.240]  will not live in the only county in the state of Texas that makes you pay for
[3:24:04.240 --> 3:24:08.600]  other people's abortions and sex changes and your property taxes. It's a
[3:24:08.600 --> 3:24:13.720]  franchise tax on our business making me pay for that crap. It's evil. And I'm
[3:24:13.720 --> 3:24:18.960]  digressing, but you do need to get prepared. You do need to go to wherever
[3:24:18.960 --> 3:24:23.160]  you go and get zinc and get multi-vitamins. They all work together. And
[3:24:23.160 --> 3:24:26.680]  anything essential you need it and you need to get X3. It's 60% off even though
[3:24:26.680 --> 3:24:29.240]  we're going to sell out in two weeks. I just said, you know what? I've been 40%
[3:24:29.240 --> 3:24:32.520]  off, 60% off. And then when I said I wouldn't do that back in December anymore,
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:37.080]  50% off. I want, if I could give it to you, I would. It helps us fund ourselves
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:39.760]  in the future. Storeable foods available again. Other folks say they have it.
[3:24:39.760 --> 3:24:42.880]  They're lying to you. We have it. infowarstore.com. Get it in now. They may
[3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:46.240]  stop in a week or two again. Take a new order. That's the word because they're
[3:24:46.240 --> 3:24:49.640]  just exploding right now. And food shortages are coming up. You know, you
[3:24:49.640 --> 3:24:52.760]  know, all that. And with the cancel the election, the Democrats have already
[3:24:52.760 --> 3:24:57.880]  moved back their, their, their deal to the middle of August out of July. This is
[3:24:57.880 --> 3:25:02.680]  an economic war. This is, that's the big agenda of this. And Trump's having to
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:06.180]  ride the tiger here, but I would take advantage of the products at infowar
[3:25:06.180 --> 3:25:09.800]  store.com or call toll free triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:25:09.800 --> 3:25:13.320]  And I've been a lot more controls. Everybody knows I do probably one
[3:25:13.320 --> 3:25:16.800]  tenth of yelling and screaming. I used to be one twentieth. And today I went
[3:25:16.800 --> 3:25:20.880]  wild. It's because during the break, I'm reading all these admissions and the
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:23.680]  China knowingly shipped in contaminated stuff and the Bill and Linda Gates are
[3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:28.560]  involved. And it's just, and it takes some doing to stand up to these guys. You
[3:25:28.560 --> 3:25:31.680]  know, when Bill Gates is attacking me and his through surrogates and TV shows
[3:25:31.680 --> 3:25:34.720]  and, you know, his wife basically said, if people don't stop saying he's a
[3:25:34.720 --> 3:25:37.440]  eugenicist, they're going, they're going to kill him. She said that in Germany
[3:25:37.440 --> 3:25:42.400]  six years ago. That's serious stuff. And so it doesn't scare me when I go over
[3:25:42.400 --> 3:25:46.200]  that threshold and do the right thing. I get fired up. And that's what happens
[3:25:46.200 --> 3:25:51.840]  is, is that, is that I'm so alive that then I see almost everybody else in a
[3:25:51.840 --> 3:25:56.360]  fetal position, or even if you're not scared, you're not doing anything. Speak
[3:25:56.360 --> 3:26:00.680]  out, say it's all a fraud. Point out it's a globalist takeover. Point out China
[3:26:00.680 --> 3:26:04.680]  is shipping in masks. It's in the news that they're shipping masks from China
[3:26:04.680 --> 3:26:07.760]  that are contaminated to LA and the mayor is going to make you wear them and
[3:26:07.760 --> 3:26:14.560]  give it to you. And of course they're involved. These are demons. Realize it.
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:19.280]  The Democratic Party is a satanic group. They even have a big national movie
[3:26:19.280 --> 3:26:23.640]  where the Democrats are officially called hell Satan are adopting the church
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:30.960]  of Satan as their religion and huge chapters everywhere. Go to a Democrat
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:35.000]  event. Half of them will tell you they worship Satan, their school teachers,
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:39.640]  their lawyers, their police. They're everywhere. You want to see what
[3:26:39.640 --> 3:26:44.600]  Satanism looks like? It's the, it's the pentacle upside down. The pentacle is
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:47.920]  the symbol of humans. A star. It's why they go, that person's a star. This
[3:26:47.920 --> 3:26:52.120]  person's a star. The head, the arms, the legs. It's a pentacle. What is that
[3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:56.880]  upside down? Humanity going down. What's the symbol of an airplane going down?
[3:26:56.880 --> 3:27:03.800]  What's the symbol in runes? It's a cross with the arms up. That's a tree. That's
[3:27:03.800 --> 3:27:10.280]  alive. When a tree dies, its arms go down. Its branches fall. The peace symbol
[3:27:10.280 --> 3:27:17.480]  is the symbol of death. They chose it. The peace movement is a satanic religion.
[3:27:17.480 --> 3:27:21.320]  I know. Believe me.
[3:27:23.240 --> 3:27:26.120]  All right. Matt Bracken takes over. I'll tell you what's coming up, Matt. We love
[3:27:26.120 --> 3:27:30.680]  you, my friend, former Navy SEAL best-selling author. Take over.
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:36.600]  Well, Alex, what a day to come in. I'm going to, I'm going to kind of pick up
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:41.960]  where Jeff Nyquist over on Monday. That's one of the most must-see interviews
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:47.560]  that I've ever seen on Alex Jones or on any show, anywhere. Anybody that didn't
[3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:52.840]  see that, it's on band.video as its own like a half-hour standalone interview.
[3:27:52.840 --> 3:27:57.160]  I highly recommend it. I'm going to, today I'm going to look at COVID-19
[3:27:57.160 --> 3:28:02.840]  primarily as a biological warfare weapon and where that's going to take us,
[3:28:02.840 --> 3:28:08.280]  both inside of America and internationally. And I'm going to try to look at the
[3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:14.120]  chessboard a few steps ahead, you know, the old 3D chessboard, because it's so
[3:28:14.120 --> 3:28:18.760]  easy to get caught up inside of your own event horizon. There's so much going on
[3:28:18.760 --> 3:28:22.200]  that it just looks like storm clouds around and there's no, you know, you can
[3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:26.360]  barely see past your own neighborhood. So I'm going to try to clear away some of
[3:28:26.360 --> 3:28:32.120]  that and get a view from our own drone way over the horizon into the future.
[3:28:32.120 --> 3:28:37.160]  That's my goal today is to, you know, explore what I think is happening,
[3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:42.200]  you know, one, two, five years down the road. Because this, this COVID-19,
[3:28:42.200 --> 3:28:46.760]  it's absolutely a deal breaker. You know, this is blowing up the old world order
[3:28:46.760 --> 3:28:48.680]  and what comes next, we don't know.
[3:28:48.680 --> 3:28:55.960]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar
[3:28:55.960 --> 3:28:59.640]  survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[3:28:59.640 --> 3:29:02.920]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde here,
[3:29:02.920 --> 3:29:07.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:10.920]  microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[3:29:10.920 --> 3:29:14.520]  off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're
[3:29:14.520 --> 3:29:17.880]  having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding,
[3:29:17.880 --> 3:29:22.360]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back
[3:29:22.360 --> 3:29:26.760]  to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[3:29:26.760 --> 3:29:30.360]  if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory. So here's what you should do right now.
[3:29:30.360 --> 3:29:36.840]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[3:29:36.840 --> 3:29:41.640]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too. And the best part,
[3:29:41.640 --> 3:29:47.720]  you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even 200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn
[3:29:47.720 --> 3:29:50.280]  more. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[3:29:51.960 --> 3:29:56.840]  I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be
[3:29:56.840 --> 3:30:02.120]  very, very impressed, I hope. You'll be looking at me in a year or two years. Let's give me a
[3:30:02.120 --> 3:30:07.800]  little bit of time to run things. But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that
[3:30:07.800 --> 3:30:12.040]  interview. He said he was going to do it and he did a great job. You'll be very proud of our country.
[3:30:12.040 --> 3:30:19.240]  Four years ago, then billionaire businessman Donald Trump pledged himself to info wars and
[3:30:19.240 --> 3:30:25.160]  our audience that he would not let us down, that he would take the globalist on and that we would be
[3:30:25.160 --> 3:30:31.000]  very pleased with what he did. We are pleased with President Trump. He has proven that he's the
[3:30:31.000 --> 3:30:37.400]  real deal and has taken the globalist on the level that we've foreseen. But now they're striking back
[3:30:37.400 --> 3:30:43.080]  at President Trump and the people using the invisible weapon of fear, the coronavirus. Yes,
[3:30:43.080 --> 3:30:48.360]  we should meet the virus head on. Yes, we should save as many people as possible, but not at the
[3:30:48.360 --> 3:30:56.920]  expense of our hard fought liberties and freedoms. As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[3:30:56.920 --> 3:31:06.120]  in vitality, energy and overall wellness. And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas

[3:31:52.360 --> 3:31:56.520]  Now I'm here to tell you I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good job. I've done
[3:31:56.520 --> 3:32:03.160]  nothing but my duty. I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people
[3:32:03.160 --> 3:32:09.480]  and I've been fighting them for 13 years and I'll never stop while I'm growing breath.
[3:32:09.480 --> 3:32:16.760]  For 26 years, Alex Jones and Info Wars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide,
[3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:24.840]  waking people up to the new world order, Bohemian Grove, the American deep state,
[3:32:24.840 --> 3:32:33.960]  the rise of communist China, the plan for global depopulation, and global elite pedophiles who
[3:32:33.960 --> 3:32:40.840]  pray off of our young. The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support,
[3:32:40.840 --> 3:32:55.320]  our fight continues. Join us, support the Info War, and together we will slay the dragon.
[3:33:10.840 --> 3:33:23.320]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:33:25.160 --> 3:33:31.720]  All right, you've got Matt Bracken for the rest of the hour. Now, I think in the next segment,
[3:33:31.720 --> 3:33:41.080]  I'm going to talk about COVID-19 as a Chinese slash globalist biological weapon, a global
[3:33:41.080 --> 3:33:49.480]  biological weapon. But in this first segment, I'd like to talk about some of the aspects of
[3:33:49.480 --> 3:33:56.040]  coronavirus that I still think a lot of people don't understand, that will give them a better
[3:33:56.040 --> 3:34:03.640]  way of looking at this, a better way of studying the news and analyzing the news. You'll constantly
[3:34:03.640 --> 3:34:08.680]  hear people talking about what's the numerator, what's the denominator, meaning how many cases,
[3:34:08.680 --> 3:34:14.120]  how many tests, or how many cases, how many deaths, we're getting to the point where there's going
[3:34:14.120 --> 3:34:20.120]  to be clarity, because all we'll have to do is really study deaths. All of the death figures
[3:34:20.120 --> 3:34:27.800]  that came out of China, I think we can just throw them out. And that's part of their crime,
[3:34:27.800 --> 3:34:35.160]  really, in this is by lying not only about the infectiousness of the disease when they knew
[3:34:35.160 --> 3:34:40.120]  better back in December and January, but by saying, oh, we've got to contain our numbers
[3:34:40.120 --> 3:34:48.840]  are going down when it wasn't. That's another lie that basically lulled the West into keeping
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:54.760]  the gates open to this Trojan horse for much longer than it had to have been. If we had known the
[3:34:54.760 --> 3:35:00.360]  truth out of China, if it had been understood more widely the way that the Taiwanese, who have no
[3:35:00.360 --> 3:35:06.520]  illusions about communist China, if the rest of the world had gotten on the war footing that Taiwan
[3:35:06.520 --> 3:35:13.640]  got on immediately, we would have saved a lot of deaths. Now, one of the key things that people
[3:35:13.640 --> 3:35:21.720]  need to understand when you watch the daily news is that you have to separate region from region,
[3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:28.520]  because this is not something like a supernova in space that affected half the earth at the
[3:35:28.520 --> 3:35:38.920]  same day. The way to understand this is like a slow motion global oceanic tsunami that takes
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:47.400]  weeks in between city targets, because it takes a long time for it to be seated and then to spread
[3:35:47.400 --> 3:35:57.320]  and then have an outbreak. The reason that Tehran and Milan and northern Italy were the first big
[3:35:57.320 --> 3:36:05.080]  western outside of China targets of coronavirus was that they had so much connectivity to communist
[3:36:05.080 --> 3:36:12.040]  China. In northern Italy, they brought in hundreds of thousands of Chinese Coolies to work in Chinese
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:19.960]  run sweatshops so that these globalist oligarchs could stamp Made in Italy, which is the most valuable
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:26.280]  part of an Italian shoe or an Italian purse, is the label that says Made in Italy. So they,
[3:36:26.280 --> 3:36:31.720]  instead of having Italians make them, they built their own factories under Chinese management,
[3:36:31.720 --> 3:36:38.920]  Chinese Coolies, slave labor virtually, but they make enough money that they were flying
[3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:46.200]  back and forth to China. So over their lunar new year, the biggest holidays of the Chinese year,
[3:36:46.200 --> 3:36:52.280]  there was massive back and forth between Wuhan, China, where many of these Chinese Coolies that
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:36:59.560]  work in Italy, massive back and forth to Italy. So the seeding and spreading was huge there early.
[3:36:59.560 --> 3:37:06.200]  Then the other place that was early and massive, but they also lie about their numbers, is Tehran,
[3:37:06.200 --> 3:37:15.000]  Iran. Under the sanctions from the West, the lifeline, so to speak, for Iran's economy has
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:22.600]  been China, getting in there on infrastructure projects, basically hooking China on debt.
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:29.160]  If we can look at this graph a second, thanks for putting that up.
[3:37:30.120 --> 3:37:39.560]  There's a guy named Murdoch on Twitter who is a data specialist. He specializes in making graphs.
[3:37:39.560 --> 3:37:46.040]  This is a log graph. So on the left, it's logarithmic. A straight line on this graph means it's
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:51.320]  exponential. You have to use log graphs for exponential growth. Otherwise, the graph would
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:38:00.040]  have to be a mile high. So you can see on this graph, this graph starts when any country had
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:05.960]  three daily deaths reported. Murdoch does this with all kinds of statistics. New cases,
[3:38:05.960 --> 3:38:12.040]  first death from lockdown. So all of these countries start at the same relative point.
[3:38:12.040 --> 3:38:16.280]  And it doesn't matter if it's a big country or a small country, because when you're talking about
[3:38:16.280 --> 3:38:23.880]  exponential growth within a group of millions, until you've got 60% of the population infected,
[3:38:23.880 --> 3:38:29.000]  it's going to act in exactly the same way. So you can see where China was way out in front,
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:35.160]  but nobody believes China's numbers. That's a lie. But Italy, we can start seeing legit numbers.
[3:38:35.160 --> 3:38:41.880]  And we can talk about whether they're smokers or the smoggy conditions. But Italy got there first.
[3:38:41.880 --> 3:38:48.840]  Spain was right behind it. And this is leading me to this two-week lag that's so important to
[3:38:48.840 --> 3:38:55.240]  understand. If you look at what happened with Madrid following Italy, the socialist government of
[3:38:55.240 --> 3:39:02.680]  Madrid had scheduled massive feminist rallies, basically left-wing feminist rallies in cities
[3:39:02.680 --> 3:39:09.240]  all over Spain for March 8th. This is when Italy's already in a breakout, a huge outbreak.
[3:39:09.240 --> 3:39:15.000]  They had these rallies scheduled. They didn't cancel them. Spain pushed everybody to go to these
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:20.760]  massive rallies, hundreds of thousands of people in multiple cities in Spain. What happens two
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:27.960]  weeks later? Huge outbreak. Similar thing happened with Mardi Gras in New Orleans. You go back to
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:34.280]  the JAWS analogy, Amityville Island. They don't want to ruin the 4th of July weekend. The businesses
[3:39:34.280 --> 3:39:40.920]  depend on it. So they say, there's no shark threat. Well, in Spain, they said there's no
[3:39:40.920 --> 3:39:45.800]  coronavirus threat. That's Italy. We're different. We've got to control of this. They actually
[3:39:45.800 --> 3:39:53.640]  suppressed deaths in Spain. So then you see a huge takeoff. Now, what's so important to understand
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:59.880]  is the doubling rate, which in the USA is like two and a half to three days. In New York City,
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:08.040]  that's our Wuhan. New York City is our Wuhan. So if there's plenty of beds open 100 miles from
[3:40:08.040 --> 3:40:13.800]  New York, that's the preparation for a New York level of outbreak. But we're going to see it
[3:40:13.800 --> 3:40:18.840]  spreading out from New York. That's why they're fleeing. That's why they've got controls on state
[3:40:18.840 --> 3:40:24.200]  borders. The first time I've ever seen that in my life. So if you looked three weeks ago at the
[3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:31.720]  number of New York City cases two to three weeks ago, meaning people brought into the hospital,
[3:40:31.720 --> 3:40:38.200]  you know, tested at the hospital with a confirmed diagnosis, then the death appears to spike a few
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:44.360]  weeks later. So when you see a number of deaths today, think about what was the confirmed case
[3:40:44.360 --> 3:40:49.480]  number two or three weeks ago. That's how you have to look at it. That's why people are extremely
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:56.680]  worried about this all over the country. We don't want to be the dumbasses in Madrid that said, oh,
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:05.080]  Milan, that's Italy, it can't happen here. It will if you don't put the social distancing down
[3:41:06.200 --> 3:41:12.040]  outside of the Wuhan, the New York City, you have to suppress the initial numbers the way they did
[3:41:12.040 --> 3:41:18.200]  in Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, you have to suppress it at the very outset. If you wait till
[3:41:18.200 --> 3:41:24.280]  you've got hundreds of cases, then in two weeks, you'll have thousands of cases and hundreds of
[3:41:24.280 --> 3:41:30.600]  deaths. So they're trying to break that cycle. Now, does this mean Matt's all on board with, you
[3:41:30.600 --> 3:41:36.840]  know, mass quarantine for the rest of our lives? No, but I'm just looking at the disease in this
[3:41:36.840 --> 3:41:43.880]  first segment as a disease. Yes, the Democrat socialists in this country, the globalists,
[3:41:43.880 --> 3:41:48.920]  they don't want to let a good crisis go to waste. If they can wreck our economy,
[3:41:48.920 --> 3:41:54.760]  turn us into Venezuela, destroy the dollar, destroy our banking system, put millions out of
[3:41:54.760 --> 3:42:01.240]  work, they would consider that a great victory if out of the ruins, we wound up somewhere between
[3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:09.640]  Venezuela and China in terms of being a perpetual socialist welfare state. Once people start getting
[3:42:09.640 --> 3:42:14.600]  used to getting this $1,200 check from the government, that's not going to be easy to turn
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:20.120]  off. You know, it's going to be a big problem telling people, you know, we just can't do it
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:25.000]  anymore. We can't run the printing presses for the rest of your life. Some people will just say,
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:29.720]  well, I don't want to work in a bar anymore. I'd rather just stay home and collect my 1200.
[3:42:30.600 --> 3:42:37.880]  So it's creating huge problems. And when we come back from the break, I'm going to finish up with
[3:42:37.880 --> 3:42:42.120]  what's happening inside the United States, where I think it's going. And then we're going to begin
[3:42:42.120 --> 3:42:48.600]  to look at coronavirus as a biological weapon, a very dangerous biological weapon.
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:56.600]  We knew early on that COVID-19 was an engineered bio weapon. But again, people say, oh, then it
[3:42:56.600 --> 3:43:02.040]  must be the most deadly thing ever. No, it does clearly kill people. But if you're going to release
[3:43:02.040 --> 3:43:07.720]  a bio weapon for fear and to bankrupt an economy and cause panic, and to run folks off the edge of
[3:43:07.720 --> 3:43:12.760]  a cliff in a giant artificial stampede, you want to know the real trajectory, kill a bunch of old
[3:43:12.760 --> 3:43:17.000]  people, kill people that are deficient, kill people that are already sick, get rid of folks
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:21.800]  that globalists don't even want anyways, but scare everybody else. You want to control
[3:43:21.800 --> 3:43:27.320]  in to submission. And that's what's going on. So people get confused by the paradox of you say
[3:43:27.320 --> 3:43:31.640]  it's a real virus, you say it's serious, but you say don't panic and don't shut the economy down.
[3:43:31.640 --> 3:43:35.800]  Exactly. Because if you do that, they're going to keep releasing bio weapons over and over again
[3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:42.440]  because it works so well on the public. Most people are starting to wake up, but we have to
[3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:46.600]  understand that pressures being put on Trump to basically keep the economy shut for another six
[3:43:46.600 --> 3:43:50.600]  months to a year will be a depression long before that we've got to go back to work.
[3:43:51.800 --> 3:43:58.680]  My mind for more than eight weeks has been fixed, constantly scanning, constantly computing
[3:43:59.320 --> 3:44:05.240]  to understand the strategic attack we're witnessing. We know by the scripting and the choreography
[3:44:05.240 --> 3:44:09.720]  and the fact that the virus has been scanned, that it's man made and attack on our economy.
[3:44:10.280 --> 3:44:15.000]  The globalist media is firmly behind this devastating the United States and driving Trump
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:21.320]  from power. But now we know from scores of studies from China, the UK, the United States, Europe,
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:28.120]  Brazil, Japan, that the virus reinfects and attacks different parts of the body.
[3:44:29.000 --> 3:44:33.160]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is an engineered bio weapon just as the Indian scientist
[3:44:33.160 --> 3:44:36.280]  eight weeks ago conclusively proved at their major university.
[3:44:37.320 --> 3:44:43.400]  They have a name for it at the Pentagon. It's called a soft kill weapon. It doesn't kill you
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:48.280]  usually the first time, but the next time, the third time or the fourth, it does and it weighs down
[3:44:48.280 --> 3:44:55.640]  your economy in the process. It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic

[3:46:51.480 --> 3:47:21.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken.
[3:47:21.800 --> 3:47:24.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:34.840]  So on Monday, Alex interviewed Jeff Nyquist, and I think it was one of the best interviews I've
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:39.240]  ever seen. And in the interview, Alex asked him, you know, what would be a good title for your
[3:47:40.440 --> 3:47:45.400]  segment? And I was really jealous because Jeff came up with a title right off the bat. And I
[3:47:45.400 --> 3:47:52.120]  thought about it. And I'm going to title this my segment today. China plans to win the pandemic
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:59.880]  world war. That's what this is. This is a Pearl Harbor using, you know, using germs, using virus.
[3:47:59.880 --> 3:48:05.400]  It's exactly what it is. Instead of flying in with, you know, zeros with meatballs on the wings
[3:48:05.400 --> 3:48:12.440]  and sinking aircraft carrier or battleships in Pearl Harbor, they're flying under the radar
[3:48:12.440 --> 3:48:19.960]  with biological warfare. Now, there's a couple of ways that China can win. And one is simply to
[3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:25.400]  wreck America, to wreck the West, have us so on our knees that we're begging for China's factories
[3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:32.200]  to help, you know, come with the, with the aid packages. Or another way is to sow so much division
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:39.240]  inside of the USA that we're at each other's throats. And an example of this would be taking
[3:48:39.240 --> 3:48:45.400]  these quarantine rules to the absurd, you know, closing gun stores, closing liquor stores,
[3:48:46.280 --> 3:48:51.800]  following people with drones out in parks, you know, 100 acre parks by themselves and saying,
[3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:57.960]  you know, citizen, return to your house. I would absolutely draw the line there. If they say you
[3:48:57.960 --> 3:49:03.080]  just have to stay in your house, you can only go out to exercise one time. And we encourage your
[3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:11.960]  neighbors to snitch on, you know, double walkers. This is absolutely what the tyrants wet dream.
[3:49:11.960 --> 3:49:18.120]  And I would totally refuse to go along with that. If I want to go driving in my car with the people
[3:49:18.120 --> 3:49:23.400]  that I live with, or if I want to go out to a park with a few other people and not, you know,
[3:49:23.400 --> 3:49:28.680]  maybe be breathing on each other at one foot, I get it. You know, we're not totally stupid.
[3:49:28.680 --> 3:49:32.840]  But if they, if they come to the point where they're saying, you just have to stay in your house,
[3:49:32.840 --> 3:49:37.320]  because it's not fair that somebody that lives in a little apartment, he has to take an elevator
[3:49:37.320 --> 3:49:42.200]  and he's afraid to go down the elevator. So you that live in the suburb, you privileged person,
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:45.800]  you know, you just can't go in your backyard or walk around the block.
[3:49:45.800 --> 3:49:53.240]  Absolutely. We should resist that totally, totally. But that said, China would love one victory
[3:49:53.240 --> 3:50:00.280]  scenario for China is to sow discord, wreck our economy, you know, turn us into a socialist country
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:06.200]  because we've ruined the, you know, we've ruined our financial system. And all we can do is print
[3:50:06.200 --> 3:50:13.880]  money, which is the road to Venezuela. You know, if anybody doubts what about the social distancing
[3:50:13.880 --> 3:50:19.880]  thing, the reason for it, you know, all they've got to do, and I would encourage you, go on YouTube
[3:50:19.880 --> 3:50:26.920]  or go on Google or Bing or duck duck go and just search for these two words. Guaya kill
[3:50:26.920 --> 3:50:34.120]  Ecuador. Ecuador is with a C, E-C-U-A-D-O-R. Guaya kill Ecuador. Guaya kill is one of the
[3:50:34.120 --> 3:50:40.600]  biggest ports in South America. It's like a San Francisco Bay in California, where the rest of
[3:50:40.600 --> 3:50:48.280]  the coastline is just, you know, very steep and hard. With a fabulous bay at Guaya kill,
[3:50:48.920 --> 3:50:54.920]  with total connections to Asia, shipping connections like crazy to Asia. Guaya kill,
[3:50:54.920 --> 3:51:01.000]  it's 80 degrees or higher. It's on the equator. So this whole thing about it's like the flu,
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:06.440]  it's going to peter out in the summertime. Forget it. It is ripping up Guaya kill. They
[3:51:06.440 --> 3:51:12.040]  do not have a first world medical system to respond. We should be very thankful. You know,
[3:51:12.040 --> 3:51:17.560]  no matter what you think about New York City, they're not all commies, but we should, we at
[3:51:17.560 --> 3:51:23.960]  least have the resources and we're strained. If you want to see what happens with COVID-19
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:32.280]  without a first world medical system and with people living packed in slums, just Google or
[3:51:32.280 --> 3:51:39.880]  YouTube search Guaya kill Ecuador. It's brutal. It's grim. The same thing is starting to kick
[3:51:39.880 --> 3:51:46.040]  off in Manila, which is 30 million people in the Philippines. The president of the Philippines,
[3:51:46.680 --> 3:51:52.600]  you know, many consider him now to be insane. Like he's got third stage syphilis or something.
[3:51:52.600 --> 3:51:56.840]  They have to hide him even more so than Joe Biden. If they put him in front of a camera,
[3:51:56.840 --> 3:52:03.320]  they don't know what he's going to do. Well, this guy, Duarte, Duarte, I can't pronounce
[3:52:03.320 --> 3:52:09.960]  his name without notes. Anyway, he is telling China that China is going to come in and rescue
[3:52:09.960 --> 3:52:14.840]  the Philippines. When China comes in to rescue the Philippines, they're going to conquer the
[3:52:14.840 --> 3:52:22.360]  Philippines. All right. This is going to be a model for quote unquote saving third world cities,
[3:52:22.360 --> 3:52:27.400]  a place like Guaya kill Ecuador. Imagine the Chinese coming in to rescue them.
[3:52:27.400 --> 3:52:33.240]  They will then have a beachhead in one of the biggest ports on the West Coast of South America.
[3:52:33.240 --> 3:52:39.080]  They will take over the Philippines. This is one of their blueprints, one of their patterns
[3:52:39.080 --> 3:52:45.080]  for how they will will win this biological war. You know, not to mention it hasn't even broken out
[3:52:45.080 --> 3:52:50.360]  really in Africa. They've already been seating at Africa with infrastructure projects, Chinese
[3:52:50.360 --> 3:52:55.960]  infrastructure projects, you know, and loading them with debt that can never be repaid. And when
[3:52:55.960 --> 3:53:01.240]  the African population start to die off, which country is going to have hundreds of millions
[3:53:01.240 --> 3:53:07.080]  of people ready to fan out around the world to repopulate these areas as bad as it is in the
[3:53:07.080 --> 3:53:13.160]  USA? And I'm only talking about New York City for now, because it's remember it's it's Wuhan,
[3:53:13.160 --> 3:53:19.560]  then Tehran, then Milan, then Madrid, then New York City. It's a slow motion tsunami with weeks
[3:53:19.560 --> 3:53:27.560]  in between the major outbreaks. But imagine, you know, imagine now, if we had nothing like what they
[3:53:27.560 --> 3:53:31.800]  have in New York and what we're preparing around the rest of the USA. So this is what's going to
[3:53:31.800 --> 3:53:36.280]  happen in the third world. They're going to be devastated. They're going to be on their back,
[3:53:36.280 --> 3:53:44.600]  and China is going to come in with aid and colonists. Now, strictly, you know, in an American military
[3:53:44.600 --> 3:53:51.400]  context, we have we have boot camp shut down, parasol and no new recruits, the recruits that
[3:53:51.400 --> 3:53:58.760]  are graduating have to stay. We have one of our major CVN super carriers, Teddy Roosevelt,
[3:53:58.760 --> 3:54:04.200]  hundreds with coronavirus on it. Sure, if it was wartime, they could throw them overboard and
[3:54:04.200 --> 3:54:11.000]  keep doing the mission. But it's not wartime, technically. So it's important Guam, Guam,
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:15.960]  if you look at it from China's point of view, is on like the second ring of islands. And it's
[3:54:15.960 --> 3:54:23.800]  like an American missile and submarine base and strategic maritime preposition ships.
[3:54:23.800 --> 3:54:31.000]  If it gets loose in Guam, if the carrier can't do its mission, look at how how this benefits the
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:38.600]  Chinese military, something that's peculiar to a warship. If you know about this biological war
[3:54:38.600 --> 3:54:46.760]  plan, if you know that you have had nobody on or off the ship in a month, just bring food to them,
[3:54:46.760 --> 3:54:53.080]  that's it. Then you know your ship is going to be at 100% readiness. If you're a tyranny, you can
[3:54:53.080 --> 3:54:59.560]  keep people on ships for a year straight. Nobody on, no liberty, no transfers, just the crew.
[3:55:00.360 --> 3:55:05.560]  We don't do that in America. Our ships have got, you know, a few percent coming and going
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:12.920]  every week, which means they're all being seated with coronavirus. And a Chinese warship that knows
[3:55:12.920 --> 3:55:19.480]  this plan will be still mission capable months from now. And that's when, you know, they'll be
[3:55:19.480 --> 3:55:25.240]  ready to roll up all these little islands around the South China Sea permanently. You know, the
[3:55:25.240 --> 3:55:31.480]  Filipinos, the Vietnamese, they'll fall back from them. The Chinese are absolutely leveraging
[3:55:31.480 --> 3:55:40.040]  this coronavirus as a world war weapon. You can, the only argument is, did they do it intentionally,
[3:55:40.040 --> 3:55:45.080]  or did they do it on purpose, accidentally on purpose, or were they just so intentionally
[3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:52.280]  sloppy it was bound to happen? But there's no doubt at all. COVID-19 is an engineered weapon.
[3:55:52.280 --> 3:55:59.240]  The Horseshoe Bat that is the progenitor of COVID-19, the main progenitor, comes from caves
[3:55:59.240 --> 3:56:04.760]  800 miles from Wuhan. There was never a Horseshoe Bat sold in a Wuhan wet market.
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:10.280]  It came from the Wuhan bio laboratory. And the question is, and this is what Jeff Nyquist
[3:56:10.280 --> 3:56:16.120]  on Monday was getting at, this is just COVID-19. Now that China is shutting down again,
[3:56:16.120 --> 3:56:21.720]  now that they've infected the world, and they shut down from outward to inward travel,
[3:56:21.720 --> 3:56:29.800]  who wants to stop them from releasing COVID-2020? You know, the next version may be more deadly.
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:34.520]  You know, and while they keep a quarantine around their country,
[3:56:34.520 --> 3:56:41.880]  but the rest of the world gets infected with phase two. I mean, this is very scary thinking,
[3:56:41.880 --> 3:56:47.000]  but I mean, and if there's one good thing that comes out of this, of this entire thing,
[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  it's going to be the end of globalism. Anybody that suggests building a pharmaceutical factory
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:57:00.920]  in China is going to be seen as a traitor, you know, a Hanoi Jane, a Lord Hall Hall,
[3:57:01.480 --> 3:57:09.000]  a Tokyo Rose, a Beijing Betty, anybody that suggests buy Chinese the hell with them.
[3:57:10.040 --> 3:57:15.320]  If nothing else, I mean, we are a continental superpower. We can power it. We can grow it.
[3:57:15.320 --> 3:57:20.920]  We can build it. We've got the labor. We've got the brains. We do not need to be infected from
[3:57:20.920 --> 3:57:28.440]  Chinese bio labs ever again. So if our economy can survive this thing, if we don't get turned
[3:57:28.440 --> 3:57:34.600]  into a socialist hellhole out of this, if we don't go into a civil war, maybe at the end of it,
[3:57:34.600 --> 3:57:46.360]  America will be fortress America that it can be.
