[00:00.000 --> 00:11.640]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:11.640 --> 00:28.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:28.000 --> 00:38.000]  It's Sunday, March 17th, 2013.
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.040]  I am your host Alex Jones and we're going to be live here for the next two hours as
[00:44.040 --> 00:50.880]  we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time blasting out on the AM and FM dial and
[00:50.880 --> 00:57.160]  of course simulcasting with audio and video streams at prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com and
[00:57.160 --> 00:58.560]  prisonplanet.com.
[00:58.560 --> 01:05.080]  All right, my friends, where to start here?
[01:05.080 --> 01:14.000]  I remember last year, there were reports that the EU was discussing the European Commission
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.560]  taking over the private bank accounts of Greece and just exercising a large portion of the
[01:22.560 --> 01:27.120]  money directly out of the bank account after tax money, before tax money, didn't matter.
[01:27.120 --> 01:34.680]  And that caused bank runs, not just in Greece, but all over from Germany to Spain.
[01:34.680 --> 01:40.520]  Now they did propose it, it did cause runs, then they came out and denied it.
[01:40.520 --> 01:49.060]  They have begun to freeze the bank accounts in Cyprus and move in that Mediterranean nation
[01:49.060 --> 01:53.500]  that a lot of Brits live in, it's kind of like a bedroom community of England.
[01:53.500 --> 02:01.920]  They are moving to seize and in some reports are now seizing upwards of 10%.
[02:01.920 --> 02:07.800]  Some people are having 7%, others are having 10% directly taken out of their bank account.
[02:07.800 --> 02:14.320]  In fact, visitors, it says British military personnel and government personnel, to give
[02:14.320 --> 02:20.120]  me an example, Prince Philip is from Cyprus, the Queen of England's husband.
[02:20.120 --> 02:25.480]  So for a long time, it was a British held area, especially Britain, or part of the UK,
[02:25.480 --> 02:28.800]  and they're saying they're gonna have their money taken.
[02:28.800 --> 02:34.240]  So it's becoming a big deal, and this dovetails into all the preparations we're seeing with
[02:34.240 --> 02:38.280]  governments worldwide to engage in similar activities.
[02:38.280 --> 02:43.080]  So we're gonna be breaking that down and tying it into the engineered financial meltdown
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.080]  worldwide.
[02:44.080 --> 02:50.800]  Here's another one from the tap website and has direct links to the press releases that
[02:50.800 --> 02:53.040]  have been put out by PepsiCo.
[02:53.040 --> 02:59.120]  You know, PepsiCo has been caught with things like bromine or brominated things in their
[02:59.120 --> 03:00.120]  different drinks.
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.240]  And of course, two years ago, it came out and I didn't believe it until I went and looked
[03:03.240 --> 03:04.520]  at the news and found out it was true.
[03:04.520 --> 03:09.520]  A caller called in and said, Pepsi's putting fetal tissue in their flavor enhancers.
[03:09.520 --> 03:14.320]  And I said, come on, come on, don't call it, make it stuff up like that.
[03:14.320 --> 03:18.760]  Search engine did, and it was true and they had big shareholder fights over it.
[03:18.760 --> 03:22.640]  And then Obama did some federal order to block it being released, what they were doing with
[03:22.640 --> 03:25.100]  the baby parts.
[03:25.100 --> 03:29.960]  And then they said, well, we promised to start, but then the news in the last few months was
[03:29.960 --> 03:33.460]  they're just making it secret, kind of like they're moving right now to make aspartame
[03:33.460 --> 03:34.980]  not be labeled.
[03:34.980 --> 03:38.520]  It's on record to give you type 2 diabetes and brain cancer and everything else.
[03:38.520 --> 03:42.560]  Now they wanna put it in everything and not even have it labeled.
[03:42.560 --> 03:46.360]  All the time I say, hey, to friends and family, that's sugar gum you're chewing, it's got
[03:46.360 --> 03:47.360]  aspartame in it.
[03:47.360 --> 03:48.360]  No, it doesn't have sugar gum.
[03:48.360 --> 03:50.760]  I go, read the back, it does have it.
[03:50.760 --> 03:56.680]  Yeah, type 2 diabetes, both the sugar mints, you name it, the sweetened stuff.
[03:56.680 --> 04:04.140]  Well, now they just call it additives, secret ingredients.
[04:04.140 --> 04:08.960]  And so we've got a report on that and we don't know what's in it because Pepsi replaces sugar
[04:08.960 --> 04:10.680]  with mystery ingredient.
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.520]  It could be aspartame, we don't know.
[04:14.520 --> 04:20.840]  So this is the new age of tyranny where you're like, okay, I'm gonna start reading the label.
[04:20.840 --> 04:21.840]  Well, you know what?
[04:21.840 --> 04:24.560]  We're just not gonna tell you what's in it.
[04:24.560 --> 04:28.920]  It's kind of like Jim Jones, he had really hundreds and hundreds of Kool-Aid drinking
[04:28.920 --> 04:29.920]  drills.
[04:29.920 --> 04:33.760]  They never tell them if it had the cyanide in it or not, but we're gonna be looking at
[04:33.760 --> 04:34.760]  that.
[04:34.760 --> 04:41.280]  Big Second Amendment news coming up as well, very, very important broadcast lined up today
[04:41.280 --> 04:46.920]  and the incredible unprecedented attack on reporters and free speech, not just here but
[04:46.920 --> 04:47.920]  all over the world.
[04:47.920 --> 04:50.240]  We have a special report on that front straight ahead.
[04:50.240 --> 04:55.360]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and we've got the best crew in radio and TV right behind
[04:55.360 --> 05:06.120]  that glass.
[05:06.120 --> 05:33.800]  Thank you
[05:33.800 --> 05:37.200]  or shed, getsimplysafe.com.
[05:37.200 --> 05:39.520]  SimpliSafe is also ridiculously easy

[05:41.900 --> 05:44.560]  so there's no need to let a stranger into your home.

[05:48.680 --> 05:50.000]  You aren't always at home,

[05:51.800 --> 05:55.640]  protecting your property 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[05:55.640 --> 05:58.160]  Again, that's getsimplysafe.com.
[05:58.160 --> 06:03.160]  We are on the march.
[06:10.440 --> 06:13.560]  The empire is on the run.
[06:13.560 --> 06:37.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[06:37.240 --> 06:44.480]  It is Sunday, the 17th day, hard to believe time
[06:44.480 --> 06:51.200]  is really moving that fast, of March, 2013.
[06:51.200 --> 06:54.560]  And we are going to be live here for the next two hours,
[06:54.560 --> 06:59.560]  as we are every single Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[06:59.560 --> 07:01.920]  Central Standard Time and back weekdays,
[07:01.920 --> 07:06.360]  11 a.m. Central Time, the three-hour weekday transmission.
[07:06.360 --> 07:10.120]  Any news websites are infowars.com,
[07:10.120 --> 07:13.520]  prisonplanet.com is the auxiliary backup mirror
[07:13.520 --> 07:16.040]  that has a lot of exclusive news on it as well,
[07:16.040 --> 07:17.200]  but a general mirror.
[07:17.200 --> 07:20.480]  And then we stream video at infowarsnews.com
[07:20.480 --> 07:21.880]  and prisonplanet.tv,
[07:21.880 --> 07:24.360]  if you'd like to see the TV version of the radio show
[07:24.360 --> 07:26.800]  that's simulcast and the nightly news weeknights,
[07:26.800 --> 07:28.080]  seven o'clock Central.
[07:29.480 --> 07:31.640]  Okay, wow, where to start?
[07:31.640 --> 07:33.880]  I knew this was coming,
[07:33.880 --> 07:39.160]  but it is certainly gotten here a lot quicker.
[07:39.160 --> 07:42.200]  And the meltdown of the Euro is accelerating.
[07:42.200 --> 07:44.800]  The head of the Bundesbank,
[07:44.800 --> 07:47.000]  that's the most important bank in Europe,
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.720]  because Germany is the engine of the EU,
[07:49.720 --> 07:54.400]  has said that it would have to be an act of God.
[07:54.400 --> 07:56.240]  He said, technically, to be exact,
[07:56.240 --> 07:59.880]  he said Jesus Christ would have to intervene.
[07:59.880 --> 08:02.520]  That's in all the major German papers and British papers.
[08:02.520 --> 08:04.600]  We're gonna go over that here on the radio.
[08:04.600 --> 08:07.520]  For the Euro not to collapse.
[08:07.520 --> 08:09.840]  Now, the Euro was established,
[08:09.840 --> 08:12.000]  as heads of the Euro have bragged,
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.400]  to take over national sovereignty
[08:15.400 --> 08:19.600]  and to implode those countries under economic dominance,
[08:19.600 --> 08:21.600]  and then to implode the world economy
[08:21.600 --> 08:25.760]  and have the Euro be the heart of that new bankrupted system
[08:25.760 --> 08:28.960]  and to come out with the new strategic drawing reserves,
[08:28.960 --> 08:31.000]  global digital currency.
[08:31.000 --> 08:32.560]  You'll still have your regional currencies,
[08:32.560 --> 08:34.720]  but they will be denominated and backed
[08:34.720 --> 08:38.920]  in the new super fiat currency.
[08:38.920 --> 08:45.800]  So we have that report coming up today
[08:45.800 --> 08:50.080]  and happening again even quicker than I thought it would.
[08:50.080 --> 08:56.480]  Cyprus depositor haircut bailout turns into saver panic,
[08:56.480 --> 09:00.880]  frozen assets, bank runs, broken ATMs.
[09:00.880 --> 09:04.160]  The announcement was made by the European Union on Friday,
[09:04.160 --> 09:08.480]  that's the unelected bureaucracy.
[09:08.480 --> 09:17.920]  The announcement was made that they were going to take 10%
[09:17.920 --> 09:20.080]  out of everyone in the Mediterranean nation
[09:20.080 --> 09:25.160]  of Cyprus' bank accounts, including foreigners,
[09:25.160 --> 09:28.520]  the BBC is reporting, who have bank accounts in Cyprus.
[09:28.520 --> 09:30.960]  And they admit it is a private bailout
[09:30.960 --> 09:33.920]  for the European Union private central banks
[09:33.920 --> 09:39.560]  that the Federal Reserve gives $85 billion a month
[09:39.560 --> 09:41.000]  of US taxpayer money.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.040]  That's what QE Unlimited was.
[09:45.040 --> 09:46.840]  QE3 is QE Unlimited.
[09:46.840 --> 09:47.800]  Remember hearing that?
[09:47.800 --> 09:51.000]  About six months ago, Bernanke announced QE Infinity,
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.480]  QE Unlimited, $85 billion that we have to pay interest on.
[09:56.480 --> 09:58.880]  You give it to the bankers, the private shareholders
[09:58.880 --> 10:00.880]  of the Federal Reserve, mainly European banks,
[10:00.880 --> 10:02.480]  but they're really offshore banks.
[10:02.480 --> 10:03.960]  They're above the laws.
[10:03.960 --> 10:05.440]  They're above taxation.
[10:05.440 --> 10:08.960]  General Electric's part of it, $108 billion profit last year,
[10:08.960 --> 10:12.080]  offshore alone, none of that money coming back tax-free.
[10:12.080 --> 10:15.840]  And then General Electric lobbies to raise people making
[10:15.840 --> 10:21.440]  over $125,000 a year's taxes to transfer that to themselves
[10:21.440 --> 10:23.640]  in corporate bailouts and government bailouts.
[10:23.640 --> 10:27.760]  See, it's the mega-rich waging war against everybody else,
[10:27.760 --> 10:32.160]  fooling the unwashed masses into thinking that wealth itself is
[10:32.160 --> 10:35.960]  a crime and that if they destroy wealth,
[10:35.960 --> 10:39.880]  they will somehow get money.
[10:39.880 --> 10:44.560]  Now, if you go to infowars.com, you
[10:44.560 --> 10:49.040]  can see a special report, a video
[10:49.040 --> 10:51.720]  that I filed this morning breaking this down
[10:51.720 --> 10:54.800]  and going over some of the background.
[10:54.800 --> 10:57.480]  And we can punch that up on screen for TV viewers.
[10:57.480 --> 11:02.520]  Special report, EU steals nation's private bank accounts,
[11:02.520 --> 11:05.480]  starts EU-wide bank runs.
[11:05.480 --> 11:06.880]  Now, that's my headline.
[11:06.880 --> 11:12.960]  I can show you again here from the Daily Mail.
[11:12.960 --> 11:15.720]  Osborne vows to protect Britain's armed forces
[11:15.720 --> 11:18.680]  in Cyprus as cash machines are emptied
[11:18.680 --> 11:25.080]  and 60,000 British savers face losing 10% in bank accounts,
[11:25.080 --> 11:27.240]  10% out of their bank accounts.
[11:27.240 --> 11:30.320]  That's just some of the headlines
[11:30.320 --> 11:33.800]  that we have dealing with all of this.
[11:33.800 --> 11:34.640]  Here's another one.
[11:34.640 --> 11:38.440]  ATM's drained as bailout tax triggers run on banks.
[11:38.440 --> 11:42.080]  That's the Australian newspaper, The Edge.
[11:42.080 --> 11:44.080]  The UK party, UK Independence Party,
[11:44.080 --> 11:46.760]  is denied as O'Farr Hodge, fastest growing party
[11:46.760 --> 11:49.440]  in England, who's been on this frequently.
[11:49.440 --> 11:51.640]  He has predicted all of this, so now their party
[11:51.640 --> 11:53.600]  is just winning elections everywhere,
[11:53.600 --> 11:56.360]  including in the EU elections.
[11:56.360 --> 11:58.800]  And the so-called Conservative Party
[11:58.800 --> 12:02.960]  and the Prime Minister of England is totally freaking out,
[12:02.960 --> 12:06.240]  saying do not join their party or it'll basically
[12:06.240 --> 12:08.240]  bring down England.
[12:08.240 --> 12:10.560]  See, being right has a lot of power attached to it.
[12:10.560 --> 12:12.360]  Let's continue here.
[12:12.360 --> 12:15.160]  Here's Business Insider.
[12:15.160 --> 12:17.800]  Only Jesus can save the Euro zones
[12:17.800 --> 12:19.120]  as the head of the Deutsche Bank.
[12:19.120 --> 12:20.840]  We're going to be getting into that report.
[12:20.840 --> 12:23.560]  But again, it was designed from the beginning to implode.
[12:23.560 --> 12:27.600]  So the announcement was made Friday afternoon by the EU.
[12:27.600 --> 12:30.560]  Now, the EU has a parliament that Nigel Farage
[12:30.560 --> 12:32.000]  is a UK member of.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.680]  But as he's pointed out, 80 plus percent of British laws
[12:35.680 --> 12:38.640]  or UK laws now get made not by the parliament.
[12:38.640 --> 12:39.840]  They just get to vote.
[12:39.840 --> 12:45.560]  And then that's a recommendation to the EU bureaucracy
[12:45.560 --> 12:47.840]  that's exempt from taxes.
[12:47.840 --> 12:50.040]  You just heard me right, just like our Congress exempts
[12:50.040 --> 12:54.680]  themselves from Obamacare and insider trading laws.
[12:54.680 --> 12:57.000]  And of course, that's illegal to pass a law saying
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.120]  you can do something illegal.
[12:58.120 --> 12:59.040]  It's unconstitutional.
[12:59.040 --> 13:01.040]  They should all be arrested that vote for that.
[13:01.040 --> 13:04.080]  Still, they don't even pay their own taxes.
[13:04.080 --> 13:06.200]  Remember when the head of the IMF
[13:06.200 --> 13:08.880]  that's part of the EU bureaucracy,
[13:08.880 --> 13:10.640]  what is it, Legrand, how do you pronounce her name?
[13:10.640 --> 13:12.880]  The blonde.
[13:12.880 --> 13:15.240]  She came out and said, oh, the people in the euro
[13:15.240 --> 13:16.400]  aren't working enough.
[13:16.400 --> 13:18.680]  We want six or seven days a week,
[13:18.680 --> 13:20.600]  and we want you to pay more.
[13:20.600 --> 13:23.800]  And they have these new excise taxes over Greece and Spain
[13:23.800 --> 13:26.200]  and Italy that are, in some cases,
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.600]  20% on top of other VAT taxes and the rest of it.
[13:30.600 --> 13:32.560]  And it's just shutting the economies down,
[13:32.560 --> 13:34.120]  which is the plan.
[13:34.120 --> 13:36.240]  People say, well, when you raise taxes that much,
[13:36.240 --> 13:38.240]  it kills tax receipts.
[13:38.240 --> 13:38.960]  Don't they know?
[13:38.960 --> 13:39.720]  Boy, they're stupid.
[13:39.720 --> 13:41.560]  No, they're not stupid.
[13:41.560 --> 13:43.840]  They're on record bragging that they
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.000]  work for the IMF and World Bank that are just front groups,
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  like the Federal Reserve for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.240]  and a handful of other globalists.
[13:52.240 --> 13:54.320]  And they're raiding these countries,
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.560]  driving down the value of everything
[13:57.560 --> 14:01.480]  and buying it up for pennies on the dollar.
[14:01.480 --> 14:03.200]  This is economic warfare.
[14:03.200 --> 14:05.560]  And they plan, they've already done some of it here,
[14:05.560 --> 14:06.640]  but they plan to do it here.
[14:06.640 --> 14:07.960]  So let me ask you this question.
[14:07.960 --> 14:10.520]  You notice Bank of America a few years ago got in big trouble
[14:10.520 --> 14:14.880]  because they wanted to take $5 out of all debit card
[14:14.880 --> 14:18.160]  or bank card transactions with your money,
[14:18.160 --> 14:20.680]  not enough to pay $3, $4 to get cash out.
[14:20.680 --> 14:24.800]  Now they're going to charge you all these fees, $5 every time
[14:24.800 --> 14:26.640]  to use your own card, while pressuring
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.000]  you to get out of cash.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.480]  Once they get you on a cashless society,
[14:32.480 --> 14:35.240]  then they can put all the fines, all the fees they want on.
[14:35.240 --> 14:36.880]  And countries like Finland that are
[14:36.880 --> 14:39.600]  the model of this progressive socialism that
[14:39.600 --> 14:42.920]  leads to communism for more than 15 years.
[14:42.920 --> 14:45.160]  I first learned about this from an engineer for a computer
[14:45.160 --> 14:46.760]  company that works for a major company.
[14:46.760 --> 14:49.040]  He worked for IBM, who'd been over in Finland the year
[14:49.040 --> 14:51.640]  before, and working on their computer systems.
[14:51.640 --> 14:53.840]  He said, Alex, did you know everyone there
[14:53.840 --> 14:56.960]  has a national ID card that has your bank account, that
[14:56.960 --> 14:59.160]  has everything on it, and they just take money out
[14:59.160 --> 15:01.160]  whenever they want, arbitrarily?
[15:01.160 --> 15:02.680]  And as you know, that's the model.
[15:02.680 --> 15:03.840]  And he was working at IBM.
[15:03.840 --> 15:07.400]  So he was over there helping set it up EU-wide.
[15:07.400 --> 15:09.760]  He said, you've got to come on the air and talk about this.
[15:09.760 --> 15:12.160]  He said, no, I'm not allowed to because of confidentiality
[15:12.160 --> 15:13.680]  agreements working for IBM.
[15:13.680 --> 15:15.320]  But he said, just go look it up.
[15:15.320 --> 15:16.520]  And I went and looked it up, and sure enough,
[15:16.520 --> 15:17.640]  found a couple articles.
[15:17.640 --> 15:19.000]  But it should be huge news.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.520]  See, it's not that a cashless society would be bad.
[15:22.520 --> 15:26.200]  It'd be great, except global criminals run it.
[15:26.200 --> 15:28.200]  And they're going to, other than to hide,
[15:28.200 --> 15:30.320]  they don't care if you have nothing to hide.
[15:30.320 --> 15:32.240]  They want to bankrupt you.
[15:32.240 --> 15:35.920]  Because they're all offshore, exempt from it.
[15:35.920 --> 15:38.680]  I mean, if they kill a million Iraqis to get oil and power,
[15:38.680 --> 15:41.640]  which they did, a million died since the invasion.
[15:41.640 --> 15:44.400]  British Medical Journal did the breakdown
[15:44.400 --> 15:45.960]  with British government data.
[15:45.960 --> 15:48.680]  What will they do to you to have power and control?
[15:48.680 --> 15:50.120]  It's called scorched earth.
[15:50.120 --> 15:51.080]  So it's already begun.
[15:51.080 --> 15:54.560]  It's the beginning of the meltdown of the euro by design.
[15:54.560 --> 15:55.840]  We'll break it down when we come back.
[15:55.840 --> 15:56.400]  Stay with us.
[15:56.400 --> 15:59.800]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms

[16:01.200 --> 16:03.200]  If you're listening, you know the economy
[16:03.200 --> 16:04.480]  is not getting better.
[16:04.480 --> 16:07.280]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[16:07.280 --> 16:09.440]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[17:05.960 --> 17:07.280]  and health.

[17:29.080 --> 17:32.600]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,
[17:32.600 --> 17:34.720]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver
[17:34.720 --> 17:36.080]  at the surface.
[17:36.080 --> 17:38.680]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel
[17:38.680 --> 17:40.720]  using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[17:40.720 --> 17:43.520]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish
[17:43.520 --> 17:47.320]  the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[19:02.600 --> 19:04.760]  hurricanes, or the threat of martial law
[19:04.760 --> 19:06.560]  have highlighted the need for Americans

[20:00.880 --> 20:04.440]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[20:04.440 --> 20:08.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:08.120 --> 20:11.720]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[20:11.720 --> 20:15.800]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:21.800 --> 20:24.520]  So we've all been told over and over again
[20:24.520 --> 20:27.400]  that the mega global international banks,
[20:27.400 --> 20:30.920]  the groups lobbying for UN treaties to take our guns,
[20:30.920 --> 20:33.680]  the groups lobbying for larger private companies
[20:33.680 --> 20:35.640]  to take our guns, the groups lobbying
[20:35.640 --> 20:39.680]  for larger private prisons, the groups lobbying
[20:39.680 --> 20:44.000]  for hundreds of different things to destroy societies
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.160]  and make us as weak as possible.
[20:46.160 --> 20:50.000]  They are waging war against us.
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.640]  They are carrying out Agenda 21, which is stated UN policy
[20:55.640 --> 20:58.160]  to create a post-industrial world
[20:58.160 --> 21:01.760]  for the general population of the planet.
[21:01.760 --> 21:03.880]  And two articles that back this up,
[21:03.880 --> 21:08.520]  Mexico bans large cash transactions.
[21:08.520 --> 21:11.000]  Yeah, even a couple hundred dollars.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.960]  That's to track everybody and control everybody.
[21:13.960 --> 21:18.640]  Two years ago, insane ban on cash transactions in Louisiana
[21:18.640 --> 21:22.680]  on any secondhand items effectively banning
[21:22.680 --> 21:28.440]  the underground economy like swap meets and farmers markets.
[21:28.440 --> 21:31.640]  And this is happening all over the world.
[21:31.640 --> 21:34.720]  And imagine being in Cyprus, and this is now being announced.
[21:34.720 --> 21:36.440]  The EU is officially announcing.
[21:36.440 --> 21:39.320]  We have the Daily Mail, we have the BBC,
[21:39.320 --> 21:42.760]  we have all the articles linked up at info.wars.com
[21:42.760 --> 21:45.080]  for radio listeners.
[21:45.080 --> 21:47.320]  And you can go there and see them announcing
[21:47.320 --> 21:48.880]  that they seized the bank accounts.
[21:48.880 --> 21:52.680]  They froze bank accounts system-wide Friday evening.
[21:52.680 --> 21:54.640]  People can't even get into them.
[21:54.640 --> 21:57.720]  And the word is on Monday, the EU's announced 10%
[21:57.720 --> 21:58.720]  will be taken out.
[21:58.720 --> 22:00.800]  And they say they may start taking more.
[22:00.800 --> 22:02.480]  So how do you like too big to fail?
[22:02.480 --> 22:05.160]  You see, if you were Bernie Madoff's only problem
[22:05.160 --> 22:07.840]  was stealing $100 billion and stealing it
[22:07.840 --> 22:10.720]  from other elitists that invested with him.
[22:10.720 --> 22:12.960]  He kind of ripped off the robber baron class,
[22:12.960 --> 22:15.200]  the kind of insider Wall Street class,
[22:15.200 --> 22:17.480]  with Ponzi schemes beyond Ponzi schemes.
[22:17.480 --> 22:20.520]  Now, if he would have been MF Global and John Corzine,
[22:20.520 --> 22:22.720]  the head of MF Global, of course,
[22:22.720 --> 22:24.680]  previously been the head of Goldman Sachs,
[22:24.680 --> 22:28.200]  the very top of the pyramid, $40 billion
[22:28.200 --> 22:29.720]  just came up missing.
[22:29.720 --> 22:33.200]  $2 billion of it, private people's bank accounts
[22:33.200 --> 22:36.520]  in a gold company, a gold broker company
[22:36.520 --> 22:38.400]  that they had taken over.
[22:38.400 --> 22:40.480]  And by the way, they'd done that a year before.
[22:40.480 --> 22:42.320]  No one, because we've interviewed victims of it,
[22:42.320 --> 22:44.320]  and it came out in the press a few years ago.
[22:44.320 --> 22:45.360]  I mean, most of you know about it.
[22:45.360 --> 22:46.440]  Even if you're hiding under a rock,
[22:46.440 --> 22:48.720]  that was big financial news, that,
[22:48.720 --> 22:51.680]  oh, we took your private sequestered accounts.
[22:53.600 --> 22:56.000]  So this is the type of stuff going on.
[22:56.000 --> 22:59.240]  And that's the problem with the cashless system.
[22:59.240 --> 23:04.160]  Cashless society, if Jesus was running it,
[23:04.160 --> 23:05.080]  it wouldn't be a problem.
[23:05.080 --> 23:09.160]  But see, when corrupt devils have full control over you,
[23:09.160 --> 23:13.640]  and you have no privacy, but they have total privacy,
[23:13.640 --> 23:15.000]  that's called tyranny.
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.960]  When the government has total secrecy,
[23:16.960 --> 23:19.320]  and you have no secrecy, that's called tyranny.
[23:19.320 --> 23:21.520]  When we have total secrecy,
[23:21.520 --> 23:23.880]  and the government has no secrecy, that's called liberty.
[23:23.880 --> 23:26.120]  When the government fears the people, that's called liberty.
[23:26.120 --> 23:28.720]  When the people fear the government, it's called tyranny.
[23:28.720 --> 23:31.480]  And by the way, pull this up from Reuters for folks.
[23:31.480 --> 23:32.640]  I mean, it was all over the place,
[23:32.640 --> 23:34.560]  but they'll like seeing it in Reuters.
[23:35.880 --> 23:38.200]  Intelligence agencies given access
[23:38.200 --> 23:40.880]  to all Americans' financial information.
[23:41.840 --> 23:44.480]  Remember Richard Nixon was gonna go to jail
[23:44.480 --> 23:47.320]  till he resigned for having IRS files?
[23:47.320 --> 23:48.280]  He wasn't supposed to have that.
[23:48.280 --> 23:49.320]  Well, he's the president.
[23:49.320 --> 23:50.240]  He's a dictator.
[23:50.240 --> 23:53.040]  He's our daddy, like Chris Rock said, of Obama.
[23:53.040 --> 23:54.560]  No, he wasn't.
[23:54.560 --> 23:56.240]  The president can't molest children.
[23:56.240 --> 23:58.680]  The president can't rob banks.
[23:58.680 --> 23:59.680]  At least they could in the past,
[23:59.680 --> 24:00.960]  but now they're the president.
[24:00.960 --> 24:02.080]  Yeah, there it is, exclusive.
[24:02.080 --> 24:05.960]  US plans to let spy agencies scour American finances.
[24:05.960 --> 24:07.640]  Now, it came out because of leaks
[24:07.640 --> 24:09.240]  of Obama's cybersecurity order
[24:09.240 --> 24:10.840]  that if you actually typed it in,
[24:10.840 --> 24:15.200]  MSNBC or CNBC got it right.
[24:15.200 --> 24:19.560]  Go back with that search to just Google or startpage.com
[24:19.560 --> 24:22.480]  and type in the same headline,
[24:22.480 --> 24:24.840]  but click on the first article from four days ago
[24:24.840 --> 24:26.360]  and send it to that new one out of Reuters.
[24:26.360 --> 24:30.400]  It's actually spy agencies have been scouring your data.
[24:30.400 --> 24:32.560]  See, oh yeah, for years.
[24:32.560 --> 24:34.200]  It's a felony every time they do it.
[24:34.200 --> 24:35.040]  Now they're spinning it.
[24:35.040 --> 24:39.520]  Oh, they're about to get access to stop Al-Qaeda, of course,
[24:39.520 --> 24:41.520]  which the government's put in charge in Libya,
[24:41.520 --> 24:43.040]  Syria, and Afghanistan,
[24:43.040 --> 24:45.880]  and now it's coming out that the government runs Al-Qaeda.
[24:45.880 --> 24:49.360]  I heard three shows, I think it was Wednesday of this week,
[24:49.360 --> 24:53.480]  local radio, just surfing the talk radio,
[24:53.480 --> 24:57.080]  one out of San Antonio, two out of Austin,
[24:57.080 --> 25:00.080]  talking about the government running Taliban and Al-Qaeda,
[25:00.080 --> 25:02.880]  talking about how they use it to take our liberties
[25:02.880 --> 25:05.520]  and how they wind up radical terrorists.
[25:05.520 --> 25:07.920]  It isn't that the government does all the attacks.
[25:07.920 --> 25:09.120]  Let me explain this.
[25:09.120 --> 25:11.960]  Criminal elements in government and mega corporations
[25:11.960 --> 25:13.840]  finance and fund them.
[25:13.840 --> 25:18.840]  So, and the low level jihadi doesn't even know that,
[25:21.040 --> 25:22.920]  but it keeps coming out at the highest level
[25:22.920 --> 25:25.320]  the Al-Qaeda commanders work for,
[25:25.320 --> 25:30.320]  CIA, private corporations, MI6, MI5, Shin Bet, Mossad.
[25:34.040 --> 25:37.400]  The French intelligence has been caught, of course you do.
[25:37.400 --> 25:39.000]  Every time a French president gets caught
[25:39.000 --> 25:40.280]  with some hooker or something,
[25:40.280 --> 25:42.440]  there's a terror attack or a threat of one.
[25:42.440 --> 25:45.080]  I mean, Clinton even got caught
[25:45.080 --> 25:47.360]  missiling aspirin factories in Africa
[25:47.360 --> 25:50.160]  when it got proven he was lying about Monica Lewinsky.
[25:50.160 --> 25:53.200]  And then news came out of him raping women,
[25:53.200 --> 25:56.800]  and then he paid them off, and boom, missile attacks.
[25:56.800 --> 25:59.840]  Missiles, this is what they do.
[26:01.040 --> 26:03.480]  Governor Ridge two years ago, I guess he has a conscience,
[26:03.480 --> 26:04.760]  former head of Homeland Security,
[26:04.760 --> 26:06.600]  first head of Homeland Security, wrote a book and said,
[26:06.600 --> 26:09.520]  I didn't like being ordered to issue fake terror alerts
[26:09.520 --> 26:10.840]  every time the Bush administration
[26:10.840 --> 26:12.520]  had some embarrassing news.
[26:12.520 --> 26:15.480]  Look, whether terrorism's all real or not,
[26:15.480 --> 26:17.160]  most of it's fake, we know that,
[26:17.160 --> 26:18.120]  don't give into it.
[26:18.120 --> 26:20.400]  Say, fine, I don't want security on planes.
[26:20.400 --> 26:22.920]  Let something happen one out of a million.
[26:22.920 --> 26:26.200]  I'd rather have that than live in a giant prison
[26:26.200 --> 26:29.720]  where the government that's so big it can protect everybody,
[26:29.720 --> 26:31.000]  well, it's gonna go ahead and enslave you.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.400]  Kind of like, hey, isn't this chip in my arm great?
[26:33.400 --> 26:35.880]  I can buy and sell with it, can't lose it.
[26:35.880 --> 26:37.920]  And they know everywhere you go, everything you do,
[26:37.920 --> 26:39.800]  and you're like, well, I don't have nothing to hide.
[26:39.800 --> 26:41.560]  Well, it's not that you are bad,
[26:41.560 --> 26:43.760]  so you're showing how good you are.
[26:43.760 --> 26:45.440]  It's kind of like, I'm not gonna lock my doors
[26:45.440 --> 26:47.480]  because I'm not a bad person.
[26:47.480 --> 26:50.560]  You don't lock your doors because you're a bad person.
[26:50.560 --> 26:52.880]  You lock your doors, I know this is elementary,
[26:52.880 --> 26:54.200]  but not for some people.
[26:54.200 --> 26:57.280]  You don't lock your doors to protect yourself from yourself.
[26:57.280 --> 27:00.240]  You lock your doors to protect yourself from other people.
[27:00.240 --> 27:01.840]  You don't protect your data
[27:01.840 --> 27:03.600]  because you have something to hide.
[27:04.520 --> 27:07.440]  You know, I get in bed with my wife sometimes, you know,
[27:07.440 --> 27:09.400]  to have male-female relations,
[27:09.400 --> 27:11.280]  and you know, we lower the blinds.
[27:11.280 --> 27:14.200]  You know, put a movie on for the kids downstairs.
[27:14.200 --> 27:16.440]  I mean, it's like, what do I have to hide?
[27:16.440 --> 27:17.760]  Well, I just like to be private.
[27:17.760 --> 27:20.680]  You know, my bathroom, I got a bathroom door.
[27:20.680 --> 27:22.760]  I close the door when I go to the bathroom.
[27:22.760 --> 27:24.720]  In fact, here at the office, they automatically close.
[27:24.720 --> 27:26.040]  Maybe the windows should be open
[27:26.040 --> 27:27.960]  to prove I'm not doing something bad in there.
[27:27.960 --> 27:29.360]  You know, I mean, they sat all over the country.
[27:29.360 --> 27:31.880]  We need to inspect your backyard gardens.
[27:31.880 --> 27:33.960]  You might be groving something illegal.
[27:33.960 --> 27:35.080]  Oh, that makes a lot of sense.
[27:35.080 --> 27:37.480]  I mean, they're treating us like total criminals,
[27:37.480 --> 27:39.520]  and now they're treating us like criminals.
[27:39.520 --> 27:41.400]  They're treating us like total criminals,
[27:41.400 --> 27:44.920]  and now they're taking everybody's bank accounts in Cyprus
[27:44.920 --> 27:46.760]  and taking 10% off the top,
[27:46.760 --> 27:49.400]  and they've put federal regulations in here
[27:49.400 --> 27:51.480]  six years ago to take your pension funds,
[27:51.480 --> 27:52.920]  public and private, and quote,
[27:52.920 --> 27:54.760]  guard them for government purposes.
[27:54.760 --> 27:56.880]  They've had Senate hearings in the last few years,
[27:56.880 --> 27:58.520]  you know, that they've gotten wide coverage,
[27:58.520 --> 28:02.040]  where they're talking about taking 10% off your account
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.120]  when the government takes it over to manage it.
[28:05.120 --> 28:06.840]  Isn't that nice?
[28:06.840 --> 28:08.280]  This is after-tax money.
[28:08.280 --> 28:12.160]  Tax is on over and over and over again.
[28:12.160 --> 28:13.560]  Folks, we're being robbed.
[28:13.560 --> 28:15.920]  They knew Obamacare would bankrupt healthcare.
[28:15.920 --> 28:18.200]  They knew it would double premiums the first year.
[28:18.200 --> 28:20.560]  They knew that this all came out.
[28:20.560 --> 28:22.640]  They want to bankrupt it,
[28:22.640 --> 28:25.280]  and I've been saying this for 17 years
[28:25.280 --> 28:27.320]  because I saw the globalist do this
[28:27.320 --> 28:28.320]  in third-world countries,
[28:28.320 --> 28:30.440]  and then nine years ago in 2002,
[28:31.360 --> 28:33.280]  the IMF World Bank plans got leaked
[28:33.280 --> 28:35.680]  when Joseph Stichlitz left the World Bank.
[28:35.680 --> 28:36.760]  He says he didn't do it.
[28:36.760 --> 28:37.640]  Yeah, right.
[28:37.640 --> 28:39.920]  The Nobel Prize winner had him on like five times,
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.720]  and it came out that they're planning
[28:43.720 --> 28:46.000]  an implosion here by design,
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.720]  in Europe and here the exact plan.
[28:47.720 --> 28:49.480]  It's in my book, Descent into Tyranny,
[28:49.480 --> 28:51.800]  now an e-book at prisonplanet.tv.
[28:51.800 --> 28:53.160]  We're going to come back with the attack now
[28:53.160 --> 28:54.280]  on the First Amendment.
[28:54.280 --> 28:55.440]  They're not going to just take the guns.
[28:55.440 --> 28:56.320]  They're going to take everything,
[28:56.320 --> 28:57.720]  your money, everything.
[29:00.480 --> 29:01.400]  If you're listening,
[29:01.400 --> 29:04.280]  you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[29:04.280 --> 29:05.160]  If you're listening,
[29:05.160 --> 29:07.560]  you know the economy is not getting better.
[29:07.560 --> 29:10.240]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[29:10.240 --> 29:12.520]  Now is the time to get prepared.

[33:00.960 --> 33:04.520]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[33:04.520 --> 33:08.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:10.480 --> 33:04.220]  ["The
[33:04.220 --> 33:09.220]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[33:09.220 --> 33:12.220]  and the heart of the resistance.
[33:12.220 --> 33:15.220]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[33:19.220 --> 33:23.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:23.220 --> 33:28.220]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[33:28.220 --> 33:31.220]  and the heart of the resistance.
[33:31.220 --> 33:35.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:35.220 --> 33:38.220]  That's right, and here is a nine-minute report
[33:38.220 --> 33:40.220]  that Aaron Dykes filed dealing with the fact
[33:40.220 --> 33:46.220]  that the media freaks out whenever members of the press
[33:46.220 --> 33:50.220]  get detained for filming overseas and call it a police state.
[33:50.220 --> 33:53.220]  But here in America, I mean, this is the tip of the iceberg,
[33:53.220 --> 33:55.220]  how much my crew and other crews have been harassed
[33:55.220 --> 33:59.220]  filming on city streets, you name it, all over this country.
[33:59.220 --> 34:01.220]  And it shows the power structure.
[34:01.220 --> 34:04.220]  It wants to intimidate the press, and it's despicable,
[34:04.220 --> 34:05.220]  and it needs to stop.
[34:05.220 --> 34:06.220]  Here's that report.
[34:06.220 --> 34:08.220]  Aaron Dykes here for Infowars.com.
[34:08.220 --> 34:10.220]  Now, it's all over the media
[34:10.220 --> 34:14.220]  how a Sky News reporter in China was detained by police
[34:14.220 --> 34:16.220]  because they were filming at the Tiananmen Square,
[34:16.220 --> 34:20.220]  and they were talking about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.
[34:20.220 --> 34:21.220]  Not very well.
[34:21.220 --> 34:24.220]  We're trying to be detained by the Beijing police.
[34:24.220 --> 34:27.220]  That's when police approached them and put them on a bus.
[34:27.220 --> 34:31.220]  They stopped us because of one word, I think it was.
[34:31.220 --> 34:33.220]  We were talking about the 1989 protests.
[34:33.220 --> 34:35.220]  They didn't like that they stopped us,
[34:35.220 --> 34:38.220]  and so now we're reporting to the police station.
[34:38.220 --> 34:39.220]  And then later told them
[34:39.220 --> 34:41.220]  they weren't authorized to do their media work.
[34:41.220 --> 34:43.220]  By the media policies in China,
[34:43.220 --> 34:45.220]  and if you'd like to go on with your media work,
[34:45.220 --> 34:46.220]  you need to get the permissions.
[34:46.220 --> 34:48.220]  As an Infowars reporter for more than seven years,
[34:48.220 --> 34:51.220]  I've been all over the country filming B-roll,
[34:51.220 --> 34:53.220]  filming protests, doing interviews for Alex,
[34:53.220 --> 34:56.220]  and I've encountered this over and over again.
[34:56.220 --> 34:58.220]  Especially in cities like Washington, D.C.,
[34:58.220 --> 35:01.220]  where we're told that you can't film in public
[35:01.220 --> 35:03.220]  even though there's a clear First Amendment.
[35:03.220 --> 35:04.220]  How you doing, guys?
[35:04.220 --> 35:05.220]  How you doing?
[35:05.220 --> 35:07.220]  Can I take a look at your film permit real quick?
[35:07.220 --> 35:08.220]  Sorry?
[35:08.220 --> 35:09.220]  Your film permit?
[35:09.220 --> 35:11.220]  Yeah, it's called the First Amendment.
[35:14.220 --> 35:15.220]  Hey, how you doing?
[35:15.220 --> 35:16.220]  Hey, how are you?
[35:16.220 --> 35:17.220]  Can you take the camera off, please?
[35:17.220 --> 35:18.220]  Is that related?
[35:18.220 --> 35:19.220]  Okay.
[35:19.220 --> 35:20.220]  Is there a problem?
[35:20.220 --> 35:21.220]  Yes.
[35:21.220 --> 35:22.220]  Thanks.
[35:22.220 --> 35:23.220]  Do you have a driver's license on you?
[35:23.220 --> 35:25.220]  Well, sir, like I said,
[35:25.220 --> 35:27.220]  there's a sign right here that states,
[35:27.220 --> 35:29.220]  no electrical equipment, no video camera, no filming.
[35:31.220 --> 35:33.220]  Okay, they got three cop cars on us.
[35:36.220 --> 35:37.220]  They're not letting us leave.
[35:37.220 --> 35:38.220]  They're taking some shots, man.
[35:42.220 --> 35:43.220]  Well, is there a law or...
[35:43.220 --> 35:44.220]  I mean...
[35:44.220 --> 35:46.220]  You can't, you can't film in the building.
[35:46.220 --> 35:48.220]  You need to go through public affairs.
[35:48.220 --> 35:50.220]  No, I was just getting some material shots.
[35:50.220 --> 35:51.220]  No, you need to go through public affairs
[35:51.220 --> 35:53.220]  where you can videotape or take pictures.
[35:53.220 --> 35:55.220]  Of any federal building.
[35:58.220 --> 35:59.220]  They won't film me.
[35:59.220 --> 36:01.220]  They might be looking for me in a wreck, man.
[36:01.220 --> 36:02.220]  I killed one today.
[36:02.220 --> 36:03.220]  I didn't kill one today.
[36:03.220 --> 36:04.220]  I killed this one.
[36:04.220 --> 36:07.220]  Do you folks have a permit to film here?
[36:07.220 --> 36:08.220]  We do not.
[36:08.220 --> 36:10.220]  We don't, but we're just about done.
[36:10.220 --> 36:13.220]  In Kansas City, we were approached by security guards
[36:13.220 --> 36:16.220]  who said they had been contacted by the Federal Reserve Bank,
[36:16.220 --> 36:19.220]  which was more than 200 yards across the street
[36:19.220 --> 36:22.220]  while we were filming from inside a World War I memorial.
[36:22.220 --> 36:24.220]  And they tried to force us to identify ourself
[36:24.220 --> 36:28.220]  and then to leave under duress of being threatened with arrest.
[36:28.220 --> 36:30.220]  The Federal Bank is concerned about you guys
[36:30.220 --> 36:32.220]  taking video of their building.
[36:32.220 --> 36:34.220]  They just want to make sure to leave
[36:34.220 --> 36:36.220]  when you're back to them.
[36:36.220 --> 36:37.220]  I'm sorry?
[36:37.220 --> 36:40.220]  We were just seeing who you were and what you're doing.
[36:40.220 --> 36:41.220]  What's your name?
[36:41.220 --> 36:42.220]  My name's Aaron.
[36:42.220 --> 36:43.220]  Okay.
[36:43.220 --> 36:44.220]  Hey, Arwin.
[36:44.220 --> 36:45.220]  You're fine.
[36:45.220 --> 36:46.220]  We're just checking out this memorial.
[36:46.220 --> 36:48.220]  Not doing anything wrong, okay?
[36:48.220 --> 36:49.220]  What's your last name, sir?
[36:49.220 --> 36:51.220]  I'm not going to give you my last name.
[36:51.220 --> 36:54.220]  I'm not going to give you my last name.
[36:54.220 --> 36:55.220]  You guys can leave right now.
[36:55.220 --> 36:57.220]  Come on, guys. Let's go.
[36:57.220 --> 36:59.220]  Now, why do I have to leave?
[36:59.220 --> 37:01.220]  Because you're with him.
[37:01.220 --> 37:03.220]  Where's the property at?
[37:03.220 --> 37:04.220]  The whole park.
[37:04.220 --> 37:06.220]  Well, if he gave his name, then he doesn't have to leave.
[37:06.220 --> 37:09.220]  He did give his name, but he's kind of guilt by association.
[37:09.220 --> 37:10.220]  You guys can go ahead and go.
[37:10.220 --> 37:12.220]  What is guilt by association?
[37:12.220 --> 37:13.220]  Sir, we're not going to answer any more questions.
[37:13.220 --> 37:14.220]  You can go to jail or you can leave.
[37:14.220 --> 37:16.220]  Are you a police officer, sir?
[37:16.220 --> 37:17.220]  We do have arrest powers.
[37:17.220 --> 37:19.220]  Do you want to go to jail?
[37:19.220 --> 37:20.220]  Am I under arrest?
[37:20.220 --> 37:21.220]  No, you're not under arrest.
[37:21.220 --> 37:22.220]  Not yet.
[37:22.220 --> 37:23.220]  You need to leave.
[37:23.220 --> 37:24.220]  You're encroaching on our First Amendment right.
[37:24.220 --> 37:25.220]  No, we are not.
[37:25.220 --> 37:26.220]  Why not?
[37:26.220 --> 37:28.220]  Is this public property?
[37:28.220 --> 37:29.220]  We have a right.
[37:29.220 --> 37:30.220]  Go ahead and go.
[37:30.220 --> 37:31.220]  Now.
[37:31.220 --> 37:34.220]  Then at the Texas Capitol, I was approached by an aggressive officer who didn't like the
[37:34.220 --> 37:39.220]  fact that I was filming and tried to force me to identify myself and detain me until
[37:39.220 --> 37:41.220]  he talked with his superiors.
[37:46.220 --> 37:47.220]  Can you talk to me?
[37:47.220 --> 37:48.220]  Yeah.
[37:48.220 --> 37:50.220]  Who are you?
[37:50.220 --> 37:51.220]  You did.
[37:51.220 --> 37:52.220]  Huh?
[37:52.220 --> 37:53.220]  Let me see your ID.
[37:53.220 --> 37:54.220]  You don't have an ID?
[37:54.220 --> 37:55.220]  No.
[37:55.220 --> 37:56.220]  Let me see your driver's license.
[37:56.220 --> 37:57.220]  Peace officer, sir.
[37:57.220 --> 38:00.220]  I'm a state police and point the camera some other direction.
[38:00.220 --> 38:02.220]  Don't touch my camera.
[38:02.220 --> 38:03.220]  ID, sir.
[38:03.220 --> 38:05.220]  Show me your ID, please.
[38:05.220 --> 38:06.220]  Why?
[38:08.220 --> 38:09.220]  Suspicious person, how's that?
[38:09.220 --> 38:11.220]  Let me see your ID, please, sir.
[38:11.220 --> 38:12.220]  It happens at airports.
[38:12.220 --> 38:17.220]  Even though TSA's own policy admits that people have the right to film their encounters,
[38:17.220 --> 38:22.220]  we're told over and over again that we can't film TSA and that we don't have a right to
[38:22.220 --> 38:27.220]  report on what's happening inside airports in clear violation of the First Amendment
[38:27.220 --> 38:28.220]  and common law.
[38:28.220 --> 38:29.220]  I want to sell this.
[38:29.220 --> 38:30.220]  Okay.
[38:30.220 --> 38:31.220]  You can't do that, sir.
[38:31.220 --> 38:34.220]  It says on the website we can't.
[38:34.220 --> 38:36.220]  The website says we can't.
[38:36.220 --> 38:37.220]  Sir?
[38:37.220 --> 38:40.220]  Sir, the First Amendment says we don't need permission.
[38:40.220 --> 38:41.220]  Yes, you do.
[38:41.220 --> 38:42.220]  It's the First Amendment.
[38:42.220 --> 38:44.220]  Sir, do you write the Constitution?
[38:44.220 --> 38:49.220]  Alex Jones encountered this in 2004, as you've seen in his film Martial Law, where thousands
[38:49.220 --> 38:53.220]  and thousands of protesters are arrested for no reason and journalists are intimidated
[38:53.220 --> 38:58.220]  again and again by police and told they don't have permission to film on the city streets
[38:58.220 --> 38:59.220]  of New York.
[38:59.220 --> 39:03.220]  The police have been arresting reporters across the city, and a judge had ordered them to
[39:03.220 --> 39:06.220]  stop, but that just seemed to encourage them.
[39:06.220 --> 39:08.220]  Take him out.
[39:08.220 --> 39:12.220]  How about we go to whoever gains us here and get him involved?
[39:12.220 --> 39:15.220]  I just ask you to do me a favor and not tape over here.
[39:15.220 --> 39:16.220]  It's my fault, sir.
[39:16.220 --> 39:18.220]  Listen, first of all, I'm talking.
[39:18.220 --> 39:20.220]  I don't need you to interrupt me while I'm talking.
[39:20.220 --> 39:21.220]  All right?
[39:21.220 --> 39:22.220]  Okay.
[39:22.220 --> 39:25.220]  And I just got finished telling him that I don't want him taped over here.
[39:25.220 --> 39:30.220]  Meanwhile, trading videos created by Homeland Security and sent to law enforcement agencies
[39:30.220 --> 39:36.220]  throughout the nation advise officers to view photographers as potential terrorist threats
[39:36.220 --> 39:39.220]  and to run them through the terrorist screening database.
[39:39.220 --> 39:43.220]  See, way down there, there's a woman taking photos of the dam.
[39:43.220 --> 39:47.220]  Someone called 911 and reported a suspicious person.
[39:47.220 --> 39:50.220]  As you guessed, she's going to be a Category 3 hit.
[39:50.220 --> 39:55.220]  And since it's very important that we don't let her know that we know, both the dispatcher
[39:55.220 --> 39:59.220]  and the officer need to make sure she doesn't hear the radio traffic.
[39:59.220 --> 40:00.220]  Stand by.
[40:00.220 --> 40:02.220]  If I could ask you to wait right here, please.
[40:02.220 --> 40:03.220]  Sure.
[40:03.220 --> 40:07.220]  All over the country, there have been cases of reporters being arrested for simply filming
[40:07.220 --> 40:12.220]  federal buildings or police officers.
[40:12.220 --> 40:15.220]  Police arrest folks all over the country for filming them in public, no matter how many
[40:15.220 --> 40:18.220]  times state and federal courts say it's constitutional.
[40:18.220 --> 40:22.220]  And federal buildings, they'll say, don't videotape, even if it's the middle of downtown
[40:22.220 --> 40:24.220]  Austin, like we're terrorists.
[40:24.220 --> 40:30.220]  Our own Infowars magazine reporter was threatened with arrest for filming a judicial building
[40:30.220 --> 40:35.220]  in downtown Austin until Alex Jones protested the building and got them to admit that indeed
[40:35.220 --> 40:39.220]  the reporter had the right to take photographs of the building.
[40:39.220 --> 40:45.220]  But listen, all I'm saying is she, okay, so it's not illegal for her as a journalist to
[40:45.220 --> 40:46.220]  take photos of this building.
[40:46.220 --> 40:47.220]  Okay.
[40:47.220 --> 40:48.220]  Okay.
[40:48.220 --> 40:49.220]  Okay.
[40:49.220 --> 40:52.220]  Because because I had to sit there and explain to her that she's not going to go to jail.
[40:52.220 --> 40:57.220]  In states like Illinois, they've abused wiretapping laws set up in the 70s meant to protect people
[40:57.220 --> 41:03.220]  from covert recordings and tried to apply them to out in the open cameras and audio
[41:03.220 --> 41:05.220]  recorders trying to say that it's a crime.
[41:05.220 --> 41:11.220]  Authorities are being ordered to stop arresting and charging citizens who record audio of
[41:11.220 --> 41:12.220]  police in public.
[41:12.220 --> 41:17.220]  But the ruling is only a temporary order, which says the Illinois eavesdropping law
[41:17.220 --> 41:19.220]  likely violates the First Amendment.
[41:19.220 --> 41:25.220]  And they've even threatened people with life in prison for multiple counts of filming police.
[41:25.220 --> 41:31.220]  Allison had faced eavesdropping charges for recording audio of law enforcement in public.
[41:31.220 --> 41:36.220]  Crawford County State's Attorney Tom Wiseman charged Allison with five felony counts.
[41:36.220 --> 41:39.220]  Each carries up to 15 years in prison.
[41:39.220 --> 41:41.220]  Do you really think he deserves prison time?
[41:41.220 --> 41:45.220]  It's not only outrageous, but it's a total chilling effect on free speech.
[41:45.220 --> 41:50.220]  Just last week during South by Southwest, our InfoWars street team were ticketed for
[41:50.220 --> 41:55.220]  trying to hand out free magazines, again, a violation of the First Amendment.
[41:55.220 --> 42:00.220]  As InfoWars is handing out our monthly magazine for free, South by Southwest got some
[42:00.220 --> 42:04.220]  Austin police officers to issue warnings, then tickets, when we wouldn't stop.
[42:04.220 --> 42:08.220]  But there is no ordinance against handing out free information on public streets.
[42:08.220 --> 42:12.220]  And it wasn't until Alex Jones went down there to protest that police backed off, and
[42:12.220 --> 42:14.220]  many of them admitted they thought it was wrong.
[42:14.220 --> 42:15.220]  Did you hear that?
[42:15.220 --> 42:19.220]  Now South by Southwest people saying that the cops are harasses, because the cops are
[42:19.220 --> 42:25.220]  now behaving like they should in the Constitution, they're now having people come up and
[42:25.220 --> 42:30.220]  harass us saying you can't on city streets hand a magazine out because you're not South
[42:30.220 --> 42:31.220]  by Southwest.
[42:31.220 --> 42:35.220]  So while we put the spotlight on the case of Mark Stone from Sky News and what happened
[42:35.220 --> 42:40.220]  to him in China and how they interfered with the media there, we should keep in mind that
[42:40.220 --> 42:44.220]  our own country is under attack, and if we don't stand up for the First Amendment, we're
[42:44.220 --> 42:45.220]  going to lose it.
[42:45.220 --> 42:49.220]  In the name of terrorism, they've tried to chill speech and criminalize photographing
[42:49.220 --> 42:54.220]  public officials, police officers, and just public events in general.
[42:54.220 --> 42:55.220]  We can't let them do it.
[42:55.220 --> 42:58.220]  We have to stand up to it and say no and stand up for our rights.
[42:58.220 --> 42:59.220]  That's right.
[42:59.220 --> 43:00.220]  We'll be back.
[43:00.220 --> 43:05.220]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[43:05.220 --> 43:07.220]  pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[43:07.220 --> 43:12.220]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[43:12.220 --> 43:16.220]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[43:16.220 --> 43:22.220]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[43:22.220 --> 43:25.220]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[43:25.220 --> 43:31.220]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[43:31.220 --> 43:35.220]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and
[43:35.220 --> 43:39.220]  once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[43:39.220 --> 43:45.220]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[43:45.220 --> 43:47.220]  Check it out for yourself.
[43:47.220 --> 43:48.220]  It's incredible.
[43:48.220 --> 43:54.220]  Go to InfowarsTeam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete
[43:54.220 --> 43:57.220]  Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[43:57.220 --> 44:00.220]  That's InfowarsTeam.com.

[47:20.220 --> 47:28.220]  And I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are simulcasting video right now at InfowarsNews.com

[47:29.220 --> 47:33.220]  And if you were watching, you could see the video that we just sent out.
[47:33.220 --> 47:42.220]  And if you're listening, the report is posted up for everyone at Infowars.com via YouTube.
[47:42.220 --> 47:49.020]  And understand, on our YouTube channels that have over 400 million views and on PrisonPlanet.tv,
[47:49.020 --> 47:52.220]  we have all these incidents unedited with our reporters.
[47:52.220 --> 47:57.100]  So you understand, it was in the Kansas City Star and it's been in the news.
[47:57.100 --> 48:01.880]  We want a lawsuit over this for an unspecified amount of money in the settlement for our
[48:01.880 --> 48:08.060]  reporter being arrested in Pittsburgh, Rob Do.
[48:08.060 --> 48:11.760]  Settle the lawsuit is the way to put it, over this.
[48:11.760 --> 48:17.340]  And imagine in America, you have to understand, folks, I've been in DC with national film
[48:17.340 --> 48:24.220]  crews from Discovery Channel, History Channel, Independent Film Channel, and one other.
[48:24.220 --> 48:29.580]  And they're there with official film crews who've gone and tried to get permits, which
[48:29.580 --> 48:32.580]  you're not even supposed to get a permit to film in public places unless it's for entertainment.
[48:32.580 --> 48:36.580]  You're gonna be blocking streets, but they've expanded that out to the First Amendment and
[48:36.580 --> 48:40.740]  freedom of the press and taught the police that it's arrestable to film anywhere basically
[48:40.740 --> 48:42.160]  in the country.
[48:42.160 --> 48:45.740]  And only where people push back to they back off, but I've been there where they refuse
[48:45.740 --> 48:48.620]  them permits in DC when they ask for them.
[48:48.620 --> 48:53.740]  And then you're on a sidewalk, you're in the middle of a field with just a camera guy and
[48:53.740 --> 48:58.060]  a sound guy, 500 yards from the Washington Monument.
[48:58.060 --> 49:02.180]  And the police come over and say, we're going to arrest you, you can't film here.
[49:02.180 --> 49:05.460]  And they say, but the city wouldn't give us a permit, and they go, we don't care, we're
[49:05.460 --> 49:06.460]  going to arrest you.
[49:06.460 --> 49:12.300]  And then they walk over to tourist and say, you can't film your children.
[49:12.300 --> 49:16.140]  I thought the first time this happened, they were just harassing us.
[49:16.140 --> 49:22.840]  Try to go to the White House and stand on the streets they've got barricaded around
[49:22.840 --> 49:24.660]  it like a third world country.
[49:24.660 --> 49:28.780]  They've suspended the jurors as well now, and try to film.
[49:28.780 --> 49:33.660]  They'll come out and say, Secret Service in police uniforms, Secret Service actually has
[49:33.660 --> 49:34.660]  uniformed police.
[49:34.660 --> 49:37.900]  They'll say, I'm going to arrest you if you don't stop filming.
[49:37.900 --> 49:40.740]  You go, but First Amendment, all right, get up against the deal.
[49:40.740 --> 49:44.540]  You heard me being polite with the New York police out there, where they had arrested
[49:44.540 --> 49:50.400]  over 1,000 peaceful people, including journalists, AP journalists, famous journalists, who would
[49:50.400 --> 49:53.540]  just be there showing a peaceful demonstration.
[49:53.540 --> 49:57.720]  Or people walking down the sidewalk, and they would throw you in the Pier 57 facility and
[49:57.720 --> 50:01.620]  run buses in there day and night to make you vomit and get sick.
[50:01.620 --> 50:04.280]  That came out in lawsuits, they did it on purpose.
[50:04.280 --> 50:10.500]  So I'm there during the day, 400 yards or so by the barricades at Pier 57, an old city
[50:10.500 --> 50:13.820]  bus terminal built out over the river.
[50:13.820 --> 50:18.420]  And the cops come over and say, I'm going to arrest you if you film this.
[50:18.420 --> 50:23.300]  He was singing to my reporters, so I said, nicely, sir, I'm the one that ordered them
[50:23.300 --> 50:24.300]  to.
[50:24.300 --> 50:25.680]  Shut up, did I tell you to talk?
[50:25.680 --> 50:30.220]  And folks, if you ask New York cops for directions, they talk to you like that.
[50:30.220 --> 50:34.560]  It's like North Korea, the government wants you to know you're low scum.
[50:34.560 --> 50:37.420]  We've been broken like a pimp breaks a prostitute.
[50:37.420 --> 50:43.180]  Now, not all departments are totally criminal, but still in Austin last weekend.
[50:43.180 --> 50:45.500]  And there's film and footage of this on infoawards.com.
[50:45.500 --> 50:48.800]  It got picked up by local news as well.
[50:48.800 --> 50:51.860]  At first when I called the local news, I said, we can't hand out magazines or literature
[50:51.860 --> 50:52.860]  anywhere downtown.
[50:52.860 --> 50:54.620]  We're not allowed to have bumper stickers.
[50:54.620 --> 50:56.620]  The News 8 guy goes, come on, are you serious?
[50:56.620 --> 50:58.280]  And I said, listen, come down.
[50:58.280 --> 50:59.780]  They came down.
[50:59.780 --> 51:00.780]  Sure enough, it was true.
[51:00.780 --> 51:03.800]  And the cops went, we won't enforce this ordinance.
[51:03.800 --> 51:05.500]  The ordinance doesn't say they can do that.
[51:05.500 --> 51:08.380]  And if they did have an ordinance, you can't have an ordinance saying we're all galley
[51:08.380 --> 51:10.840]  slaves or blacks or slaves again.
[51:10.840 --> 51:14.100]  You can't just do whatever you want.
[51:14.100 --> 51:17.460]  And I mean, first they said, well, get two blocks away from the convention center.
[51:17.460 --> 51:18.460]  And then, you know what?
[51:18.460 --> 51:19.740]  I'm gonna go ahead and write you a ticket.
[51:19.740 --> 51:21.060]  And that's North Korea.
[51:21.060 --> 51:24.980]  But see, when North Korea does it, it's can you believe North Korea or China?
[51:24.980 --> 51:29.820]  Well, a Fox News reporter was in Tiananmen Square with authorization, and they detained
[51:29.820 --> 51:30.820]  them.
[51:30.820 --> 51:31.820]  Detained them?
[51:31.820 --> 51:37.460]  They were torturing people, and Rob Dew was taken to the military base at the G20 Pittsburgh
[51:37.460 --> 51:38.460]  meeting.
[51:38.460 --> 51:42.800]  He was on a hilltop filming them daytime, nighttime curfew, selectively enforced.
[51:42.800 --> 51:49.420]  They weren't even letting reporters cover anything.
[51:49.420 --> 51:53.600]  And military trucks would pull up and just grab people off the streets.
[51:53.600 --> 51:56.380]  And so Dew, they wanted to find somebody to beat up.
[51:56.380 --> 51:57.980]  They had task forces from all over the country.
[51:57.980 --> 52:01.020]  It was all a psych warfare test to see what cops will do.
[52:01.020 --> 52:05.140]  And he was at the local university after the G20 had ended that morning.
[52:05.140 --> 52:08.660]  And they're staying near their hotel and hear, hey, there's cops showing up.
[52:08.660 --> 52:13.060]  So he went to the hilltop and showed police blocking off the university square, letting
[52:13.060 --> 52:14.060]  no one leave.
[52:14.060 --> 52:19.140]  And then coming up to women begging on their knees, and they would just split their heads
[52:19.140 --> 52:20.700]  with billy clubs.
[52:20.700 --> 52:23.980]  I mean, blood spraying, orgy of evil.
[52:23.980 --> 52:26.900]  And they march up the hill to where he is with the press.
[52:26.900 --> 52:29.500]  Local mainstream TV was there, they go, okay, you can go.
[52:29.500 --> 52:30.740]  Nope, you're all arrested.
[52:30.740 --> 52:34.220]  They arrest Dew, they take him freezing in the rain.
[52:34.220 --> 52:36.180]  People with hoods over their heads.
[52:36.180 --> 52:39.460]  They would take them in bathrooms and make fun of their genitalia size.
[52:39.460 --> 52:41.860]  I'm not gonna even get into the whole story.
[52:41.860 --> 52:43.980]  But this is America, okay?
[52:43.980 --> 52:48.020]  If they give the cops the order to take your property to put your wife in a FEMA cam, I'm
[52:48.020 --> 52:49.780]  telling you, they'll follow the orders.
[52:49.780 --> 52:50.780]  They're ready.
[52:50.780 --> 52:51.780]  They're ready.
[52:51.780 --> 52:54.300]  And America is gonna be judged.
[52:54.300 --> 52:59.340]  China's aborted 330 million babies, the numbers are out, we've aborted 53 million.
[52:59.340 --> 53:00.340]  And we love it.
[53:00.340 --> 53:01.600]  I mean, killing babies is good.
[53:01.600 --> 53:04.340]  So if they're gonna kill babies, they might as well take your bank account.
[53:04.340 --> 53:06.220]  If they're gonna kill babies, they might as well.
[53:06.220 --> 53:10.660]  I mean, the footage we got of him up on that hill zoomed in, where you'd have girls on
[53:10.660 --> 53:12.700]  bikes and they knock her off.
[53:12.700 --> 53:17.540]  She's like, please, and they come over and just full power, right in the head, blood,
[53:17.540 --> 53:18.540]  just blood.
[53:18.540 --> 53:23.300]  And the cops are just celebrating, devastating, devastating, devastating America.
[53:23.300 --> 53:25.940]  Devastating freedom, devastating people's daughters.
[53:25.940 --> 53:30.700]  Devastate, devastate, devastate, America is ours, yeah.
[53:30.700 --> 53:31.700]  And Europe's the same way.
[53:31.700 --> 53:33.860]  You go protest, they take your bank account.
[53:33.860 --> 53:37.460]  They're shooting people in Spain now, just mowing them down.
[53:37.460 --> 53:39.100]  And I'm an extremist for not liking it.
[53:39.100 --> 53:42.760]  The average coward will make excuses for this, because you're scared deep down.
[53:42.760 --> 53:45.780]  You think cowering will make it okay.
[53:45.780 --> 53:50.580]  Now by pushing back, I said, okay, I called the police, I called the code enforcers.
[53:50.580 --> 53:53.260]  I said, I'm gonna sue you, and I'm coming down there.
[53:53.260 --> 53:57.620]  And then they went to officials, authorities, not servants, and said, well, we're gonna
[53:57.620 --> 53:58.620]  get sued.
[53:58.620 --> 53:59.620]  We've lost suits before.
[53:59.620 --> 54:00.920]  So then they said, okay, don't do it.
[54:00.920 --> 54:05.260]  So then someone claiming they work for South by Southwest, big shaved head muscle guys
[54:05.260 --> 54:07.300]  started coming out to our street team.
[54:07.300 --> 54:11.800]  Women we hired, like Miller Lite girls, we hired a well-known team who's never had this
[54:11.800 --> 54:14.580]  happen to them in four or five years, some of their workers.
[54:14.580 --> 54:18.640]  And they said, yo, I'm scared I've never had police say they're gonna arrest me next.
[54:18.640 --> 54:20.540]  First it was, we'll give you tickets, then we'll arrest you.
[54:20.540 --> 54:25.540]  And I've never had guys come up and say, hey, baby cakes, you better watch it, these streets
[54:25.540 --> 54:26.900]  belong to me.
[54:26.900 --> 54:29.620]  You don't hand that out, hey, Austin.
[54:29.620 --> 54:35.100]  That's how they said that one guy even talked, like in the movie, little girl, these streets
[54:35.100 --> 54:38.700]  belong to us now, you better get off the street.
[54:38.700 --> 54:40.740]  And I haven't told this story till now.
[54:40.740 --> 54:44.980]  Of the five women we hired, only two would go back to work of the street team.
[54:44.980 --> 54:47.500]  And then we hired another street team and almost all of them quit.
[54:47.500 --> 54:52.540]  And I wasn't gonna do it two days, I paid to have it done all six days because they
[54:52.540 --> 54:53.540]  did that.
[54:53.540 --> 54:58.620]  In America, to try to hand out magazines about liberty and freedom, you gotta deal with cops,
[54:58.620 --> 55:05.140]  code enforcers, and then guys going, listen here, baby cake, there's gonna be a big problem.
[55:05.140 --> 55:09.900]  You either pay money to South by Southwest as a sponsor, or you don't hand nothing now
[55:09.900 --> 55:11.740]  on these streets.
[55:11.740 --> 55:14.860]  And that's what America has now become.
[55:14.860 --> 55:17.500]  And they're gonna take everything, when they take the Second Amendment, they're gonna take
[55:17.500 --> 55:20.740]  your free speech, your bank accounts, everything.
[55:20.740 --> 55:24.500]  Already in Europe, they're taking 10% out of people's bank accounts across the board.
[55:24.500 --> 55:27.940]  And the government's exempt from the taxes and exempt from the rule.
[55:27.940 --> 55:28.940]  Why not?
[55:28.940 --> 55:29.940]  You'll put up with it.
[55:29.940 --> 55:33.580]  Thomas Jefferson said the level of tyranny you live under is the exact level that you
[55:33.580 --> 55:34.580]  put up with.
[55:34.580 --> 55:36.500]  I'm gonna come back, take calls in the next hour.
[55:36.500 --> 55:38.960]  I'll give you the toll free number when we start the next hour.
[55:38.960 --> 55:41.980]  Here it is, it's 877-789-ALEX.
[55:41.980 --> 55:45.260]  I wanna first open the lines for police.
[55:45.260 --> 55:46.780]  Are you gonna follow these orders nationwide?
[55:46.780 --> 55:51.780]  Do you think it's right to say we're all terrorists filming while the government runs Al-Qaeda?
[55:51.780 --> 55:57.460]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-ALEX.
[55:57.460 --> 56:01.860]  And that is coming up in the next hour, then we'll take general phone calls.
[56:01.860 --> 56:03.780]  But I wanna hear you defend this.

[58:57.660 --> 58:59.760]  arsenal for home protection.

[59:51.380 --> 59:54.860]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:54.860 --> 01:00:01.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:08.500]  From his Central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:12.740]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:21.820]  You know, I really want to hear from police officers out there, because some people can
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.420]  watch the video where I'm being polite to the New York cop who's screaming at me with
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.620]  adolescent hatred for filming in public.
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:33.220]  If I wouldn't have done that, they would have arrested us all, ended our reporting, and
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:37.780]  beaten us up with an inch of our lives, probably, is what happened inside Pier 57.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:43.760]  And so I could get the video out to show you the evil, I mean, people ask why the Federal
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.120]  Reserve sent over private security guards to the city park, not their private property,
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.780]  the private Federal Reserve, and had their hands on their guns, and said, all right,
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.780]  now go.
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:55.780]  Go.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:00.260]  Or you're being arrested, sort of put in their hands, and the guys were instructed not to
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:03.520]  get in confrontations, so we could show it.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.060]  And then the Federal Reserve denied they'd even done that.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:10.220]  They want to just quietly do this to us and then not have us talk about it, not have us
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.140]  discuss it.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:16.900]  And it just shows how whacked out the system's gotten that in at least 15, 16 different states,
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:20.760]  like Illinois leading it, they will charge you with felonies and try to put you in jail
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:26.260]  for life in the case of areas in Illinois that we've covered.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:33.360]  And it just shows that, it's like the guy facing, what is it, five to seven years in
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:39.060]  prison with a state felony in Florida, because he released a couple of heart balloons for
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.900]  his girlfriend when she came out of the house.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:45.260]  And the state police saw it, came over, said, did you release those balloons, said, yeah.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:50.140]  That's environmental damage, a felony, and he's gonna get convicted and go to prison.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:55.500]  Cuz they'll tell the jury, you don't judge the facts as well as the law, you just do
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.900]  what the judge says.
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:01.020]  No, juries are voters, if you think a law is wrong, you let them go.
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.460]  I've always been a supporter of the death penalty, cuz I believe they're an eye for
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:07.120]  an eye, but you can't trust a criminal government to administer.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.340]  Like the Michael Morton case where they knew he was innocent, put him in jail, fought to
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.380]  keep evidence from coming out.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:19.300]  There's a case here, can attorney committed into psychiatric hospital still practice law,
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.700]  very fluent, well-spoken woman exposing Williamson County corruption?
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:28.260]  She finally got at it for what, two years, since 2011, in a maximum security mental ward,
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:33.820]  because she was going after and suing Williamson County.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:39.060]  I mean, Williamson County is a mafia, but they have short hair and wear suits so no
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.060]  one can believe it.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.900]  I mean, I live here, I know the nightmares of what go on.
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:48.820]  Quite frankly, I won't even enter Williamson County, I won't even enter Williamson County.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.220]  Sometimes I drive on I-35 through there and I drive the exact speed limit and watch out
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:55.340]  because that is Goodfellas area.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:59.300]  And it all comes out, the mayors of the towns running drugs and their kids running drugs
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.620]  and people dying in custody and all the corruption.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:06.140]  And it's their thing, it's their La Cosa Nostra.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.140]  Let's jam in a call here and then we'll come back in the next segment, see if we've got
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.660]  any police officer callers.
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.700]  Andrew in PA, you're on the air.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:21.420]  Hello, Alex, I recently watched your interviews with your fellow Austinite, Eddie Craig.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.820]  And I also read a couple of articles about Eddie Craig in the news.
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:28.660]  And after seeing that your fellow Austinite, Eddie Craig, can use perfect legal means to
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:31.540]  get out of paying traffic tickets and also get out of paying taxes.
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.700]  Yeah, that's because they break the law the way they give them, violate the state and
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.700]  federal constitutions.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.940]  Almost everything the police do is illegal.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.400]  But they've been doing it so long that they think it's normal.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.460]  So now they go, hey, you can't hand out literature on the street.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.940]  Great preachers can't preach.
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.780]  You have no First Amendment.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.540]  And you're like, well, I'm gonna still do it.
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:52.100]  Okay, I'm gonna beat your brains out on the way to the police station.
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.660]  I'm God, I'm the state, I'm the government, I own you.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:55.660]  I am God.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:00.140]  Boy, I understand that, but my point is if Eddie Craig can use perfect and legal means
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.780]  to do this, in theory, any American should be able to as well.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.260]  So it's not too much trouble, is anyway- Yeah, I wanna get Eddie Craig back on the
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.260]  show.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.940]  I've told people that and we're gonna get him back on the radio show and the nightly
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:15.620]  news for some extensive discussions in the near future.
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.340]  All right, anything else?
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.820]  No, that's all I wanted to bring up.
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.020]  Hey, what do you think about all over the country?
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:25.500]  It's a big deal when China tells reporters they can't videotape on city streets.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.240]  It's like, those dirty commies.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.820]  But then when we do it, it's like, that's good.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.820]  Yeah, that's good.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.820]  Well, with China, you can say, well, what do you expect?
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:36.420]  But in America, it makes you think, dude, what the heck's going on?
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:40.620]  I thought we had a constitution, so that doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:44.300]  I hear you, Andrew, thanks for reminding me I need to get Eddie Craig back on.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:48.500]  We've got a large squadron of producers out there, so maybe that'll happen.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.620]  All right, we'll be right back after this break.
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.860]  I want to hear from police officers, 877-789 Alex, I mean, do you think this is a good
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:56.860]  thing?
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:57.860]  How about the FEMA camps?
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:58.860]  How about turning our guns in?
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.340]  That sound good to you?
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.620]  I had tried everything.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:05.980]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.020]  was working.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:11.500]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:17.380]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.380]  be satisfied.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.660]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:30.320]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.940]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:38.220]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.660]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.100]  Now that's results.
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:47.820]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.820]  their products.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:54.920]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.820]  Infowarsteam.com.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:05.820]  K.M.L. in Los Angeles, Clone Radio.
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:27.060]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else, Clone.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.300]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.620]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.620]  Mao took the guns.
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.180]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.540]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:41.540]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:45.060]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:54.620]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:58.180]  the mind of man.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:03.860]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:09.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:14.060]  The private run for profit Federal Reserve owned and controlled by foreign offshore banks
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:20.080]  on record says that less than two percent of the deposits that are digital currency
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.820]  in our bank accounts is actually denominated in paper money.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:30.060]  That is, for all the digital money that represents U.S. domestic notes, even worse if you count
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.980]  internationally, less than two percent.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:37.460]  So if just four or five percent of people try to go to the bank and get all their money
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.220]  out in cash, it would all be gone.
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:43.820]  Okay, that's conservative, and you've probably noticed we try to get a few thousand dollars
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:48.280]  out if you're going on a trip or you just want to bury it in the backyard.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.700]  They act like you're a criminal to do that and file a suspicious activities report on
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.700]  you.
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.700]  They don't just do it for $10,000.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:58.860]  Now, Reuters is reporting that spy agencies without warrants look at everybody's bank
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:07:59.860]  accounts.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:02.940]  Well, that's in the know your customer regulations from the mid 90s.
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:07.140]  I've been telling you that it was put into the code.
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:10.660]  It's fraudulent laws, but they don't ever want to have a debate about that because they
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:11.860]  don't want you to know about it.
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:17.140]  Now, before I go back to your calls, we got people calling in en masse here, but unfortunately
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.780]  no police officers that I see.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:26.260]  I said, hey, cops, you want to call in and defend arresting people or ticketing people
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:30.500]  filming in public on sidewalks or streets while you film us from surveillance cameras?
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:35.540]  You know there's no expectation of privacy in public places.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.220]  Who's telling you to do this?
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.460]  Watch this about.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:40.460]  I'd like to hear from you.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.620]  And I know we got a lot of good police out there.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.020]  We also got some bad ones out there.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.100]  The point is you're going to be asked to do all these tyrannical things, so I want to
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.100]  hear from you.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:51.020]  I think the phones are loaded though.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.780]  The number is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:59.080]  And I'll go back to some calls, but I want to talk about denial here just briefly.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:05.180]  For TV viewers, let's punch up the article that I have on screen.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:10.220]  Here's the BBC from yesterday, Saturday, March 16th.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.660]  It's March 17th right now.
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:17.100]  Shock in Cyprus as savers face bailout levy.
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:22.860]  And so we posted articles, we wrote articles, I did a special video report on infoawards.com.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:28.300]  It's up there right now, saying that the EU ruled the unelected bureaucracy.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.820]  You can't unelect them.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:30.820]  It's a dictatorship.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:34.540]  I've had members of the British parliament on, members of the EU parliament on, who were
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.780]  elected but have no authority, Nigel Farage and others.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:39.940]  I mean, it is a tyranny.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.440]  They exempt themselves from their own laws.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.440]  Just look that up.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.020]  EU bureaucrats exempt from taxes.
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.020]  Look it up.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.100]  They exempt themselves from insider trading, just like our Congress.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.380]  It's a criminal class.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.380]  Tyranny is the norm.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.700]  It can and is happening here.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:58.180]  Your denial fuels it, just like cigarettes fuel lung cancer.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.420]  We've got to get off this stuff.
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:05.020]  So continuing, shock in Cyprus as savers face bailout levy.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.320]  Now it's begun.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.900]  Only a few bank chains are open on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:14.400]  Those that are open will let you get your money out, but only down to 10%.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.060]  The problem is then they have to shut cuz the cash runs out.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:22.920]  The ATMs, and I have like eight articles on infowars.com saying this from International
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:30.860]  Tribune, International Business Times, Reuters, BBC, MSNBC, BBC, zero hedge.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:31.860]  It's more than seven.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:37.100]  And it says people in Cyprus have reacted with shock of the news of the one-off levy
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:44.380]  of up to 10% of savings as part of the Euro plan the government reached with the EU.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:51.460]  I mean, the EU last year appointed Mario Draghi as the new head of the new Italian prime minister,
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.940]  or was it president?
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:58.220]  I mean, they appointed the new head of the Greek government.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.060]  Now look at this.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:05.180]  You go to infowars.com and my video report, special report EU steals nation's private
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:07.780]  bank accounts, starts EU wide bank runs.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:14.040]  And under it, I link to all this mainstream news, okay?
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.840]  That I just mentioned to you.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:23.620]  So it's all got links to where it's admitted and look, listeners are on there posting the
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:27.740]  BBC article saying people in Cyprus have reached the deal, 10 billion Euro.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:31.720]  And it goes on to say, now they're announcing they're gonna take 12%.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:38.460]  And then it's got that listed right there that the lowest is 9.9, but the highest is
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.460]  12.
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:40.820]  And then that's RT and others reporting.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:44.980]  Now look at this, RT is reporting 12.5.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:49.740]  Now you just go read the EU announcement, it says up to 12%.
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:55.580]  Now look, as is common, AJ fabricates and if called later on the lie, he dismisses it
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.620]  as a rare error.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:03.100]  This latest example is AJ slanting that Bank of America would charge users $5 every time
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:06.740]  they use a debit card, and then it goes on.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.620]  I mean, that was what they said, and what does that have to do with any of this?
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:14.820]  And then down here you've got them saying, no, it's only 7% they're taking out of the
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:15.820]  bank accounts.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:20.100]  And I searched that today when I saw him saying that, and just kept double checking and that
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.140]  I was right.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:26.100]  But they just throw that out there to change the subject into is Alex right?
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:31.340]  These are admitted bots, the government on record has bots, 73% of Obama's Twitter followers
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.340]  were fake.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:37.040]  Guys, type that in, 73% of Obama's Twitter followers were fake, USA Today, or whatever
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.040]  source comes up.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.660]  Guys, I did a video about that and they said that was a lie.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:46.420]  Now Congress has come out, members of Congress and have exposed they're getting fake tweets
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:47.700]  they tracked back to the White House.
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:52.060]  Of course, the head of Twitter, the head of Facebook, they've all bragged that they've
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:56.260]  given all their users data to the White House to use.
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:13:00.940]  But see, they'll just come out and deny that this is happening, just like they've been
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:06.220]  saying about a year ago, AP wrote an article saying that there are no bullets being bought,
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:07.220]  we're liars.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:12.380]  The government hit 1.6 billion, they said, it was a million over here, it wasn't 1.6.
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:18.860]  And they went to one line item at Fed.biz, the federal purchase site, and then now they've
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:23.540]  admitted it, but they still have the Huffington Post and others say there are no bullets.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:27.860]  And then they had a big syndicated columnist, Diane West in the Daily Times, and this was
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:31.900]  in newspapers all over the country said, why does Obama need 1.6 billion bullets?
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.320]  Forbes came out and said last week, we'd have a national discussion about the 1.6 billion,
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.860]  they're already following old numbers, it's over 2 billion now, as correlated by Breitbart.com
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.860]  and DrudgeReport.com.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:46.860]  So it's well over 2 billion, thousands of armored vehicles, and they lie and say they're
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.860]  for the Marines.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:51.480]  Well, yeah, the Marines bought some of the same armored vehicle, but it's on record they've
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.120]  got big armored Homeland Security vehicles driving around, it's on record police departments
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.120]  are being given them.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.860]  I mean, everybody knows they've got those, it's all over the news.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:06.920]  But they say that I am a liar, all you got to type in is 73%, there it is, Obama has
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:12.140]  millions of fake Twitter followers, USA Today, see my memory was right, yeah, that's from
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.980]  2012, my memory.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:20.000]  President Obama Twitter account has 18.8 million followers, but more than half of them really
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.180]  don't exist according to reports.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:27.060]  It says that the web tools determine 70%, my number was 73, that must be the actual
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:30.940]  web tool, that's the New York Times says 73, they say over 70.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:36.580]  Boom, boom, boom, fake, boom, okay, you're the liars, you're the liars, do I get some
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:37.580]  stuff wrong occasionally?
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:43.740]  Yes, but usually it's underestimating, it's underestimating, in fact, now I kept saying
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:51.220]  378 million, that was an old number, Wachovian Wells Fargo, it's now over 450 billion in
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.220]  laundered drug money, and they didn't get in trouble for it.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:15:00.500]  I said Corzine stole a billion, it turned out it was at least 1.4 of MF Global People
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.500]  money.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:08.220]  Look, it isn't up to me to be perfect, by the way, it's about the world and the tyranny,
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:10.420]  is this right or is this wrong?
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:14.580]  Don't use their, see, and people ask, why do they lie about the bullets, why did Robert
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:19.540]  Gibbs come out and say, I was told a lie about foreign and domestic drones, and to deny a
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:23.260]  program that existed, Congress funded it.
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:26.700]  But they know you don't know how to look up congressional funding.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:32.620]  So Gibbs comes out on MSNBC three weeks ago and says, I was ordered to lie, I go on talk
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:38.000]  shows and they say, why do you lie about domestic drones?
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.940]  Because again, if they can change the subject and they think you're stupid and divert off
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:46.600]  into is it true or not, we'll never be able to get anywhere with this.

[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:07.960]  domestic coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:28.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he live from
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:33.680]  Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.400]  all right we did have some police officers and former police officers call in I'll get
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.200]  to them and then get to everybody else but I want to get their take on this because you
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.720]  know as someone that has a little bit of power myself I get embarrassed if I exercise it
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:51.640]  on someone who doesn't deserve it and I get I get I get embarrassed by the little bit
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:55.740]  of quote status I have being a syndicated radio host that reaches millions of people
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:00.280]  a day but then other people get a little bit of power and they act like total jerks and
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:05.700]  imagine cops are where the rubber meets the road imagine what it's like on top of the
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:10.240]  establishment with the Air Force One and the the red carpets and now all over the country
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.040]  saying you can't film anywhere in public I've seen videos where they beat people up and
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:19.780]  then and then take them to jail it's very very frightening but speaking of the denial
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:28.060]  mechanism AP Daily Times Forbes a bunch of others have gone and looked at the federal
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:34.800]  purchase records and confirmed over two billion rounds of ammo purchased delivered and ordered
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:38.660]  and that it's a massive arms buildup and the armored vehicles and the militarization the
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:44.220]  drills and then they just deny it exists and say I'm a liar Sarah Palin quoted us and they
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:48.400]  came out in Politico and said she was insane it was an anonymous posting and that I'd made
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:54.460]  it up and then Forbes and others go and look and they go no it's it's true we have a discussion
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:59.320]  why are they stonewalling because it's part of a takeover when they were illegally spying
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:05.400]  on people without warrants at the NSA they lied about it now it's admitted and and and
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:11.060]  so Oh Alex I mean on my own site they're going he's a liar they're not taking 10% of people's
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:17.140]  bank account when I'm quoting BBC you name it I mean it again because they don't want
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:23.140]  this news here and they think you're stupid well you haven't stopped anything I've got
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:30.300]  an article here out of what is it out of dig it up it's out of what zero hedge there's
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.300]  another one here where they're going wow all the major Rush Limbaugh Mark Levin Michael
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:39.380]  Savage blah blah blah they're now covering the government trying to implode the economy
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:45.380]  by design and economic takeover and that health care is meant to of course that's the plan
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:52.140]  and if I can say anything I've forced mainstream conservatism to admit that we're in deep trouble
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:55.940]  and and if we can do that then we can have a real debate about this and save this country
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:00.720]  but if see I know why tyrants always take over and most the time succeed because whatever
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:05.500]  group had freedom can't believe it's happening same reason in criminology young women get
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.700]  in cars with serial killers because the serial killers wear suits and ties and drive nice
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:16.380]  vehicles just like the you know fiction movie American Psycho that's just like Ted Bundy
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:19.640]  because they're looking for the dirt ball you know the guy with long hair and tattoos
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:25.380]  to kill him and it's the same thing here people just can't believe this is happening and it
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:31.060]  is happening the Nazis all wore suits the communists wore suits they killed hundreds
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:35.700]  of millions of people in Russia well the communists total have killed over 170 million China Russia
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:39.580]  you name it Hitler was a National Socialist but see people think he was a fascist they
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:44.060]  call themselves fascist but they use socialism I'm not defending fascism either it's another
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.920]  authoritarianism but even fascism uses socialism for the general population and then only a
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:53.020]  command and control economy for insiders on the top let's go to this quick video of Gibbs
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:58.500]  on MSNBC you can pull up articles the full videos online at 16 minutes Robert Gibbs is
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.340]  press sec I was ordered not to acknowledge the existence of drone program you want to
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:09.460]  see the full video but here's a quick excerpt where he says it's like the Wizard of Oz well
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:14.460]  then I am Toto and so are you we're pulling the curtain back the Emperor's new clothes
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:19.300]  here it is when I went through the process of becoming press secretary one of the things
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:23.680]  one of the first things they told me was you're not even to acknowledge the drone program
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:29.440]  you're not even to discuss that it exists and so I would get a question like that and
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.300]  literally I couldn't tell you what major asked because once I figured out it was about the
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:38.300]  drone program I realize I'm not supposed to talk about it and but here's what's inherently
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:45.300]  crazy about that proposition you're being asked a question based on reporting of a program
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:52.020]  that exists right so you're the official government spokesperson acting as if the entire program
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:56.500]  pay no attention to the man behind the curtain yeah I mean I mean I heard it on the phone
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.300]  with Max Cabrera running my street team was there and was talking to cops and I talked
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:04.740]  to him and talked to the and the guys like oh hey Alex I'm a listener I'm like this is
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:10.140]  wrong giving them tickets I know but that's my orders I go so you'll do anything and I'm
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:13.860]  like what about the Constitution what the Bill of Rights I I just I don't know what
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:19.060]  you're talking about look we have these rights okay and and and these rights are what made
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:23.780]  us wealthy and successful not what gave us problems and as the Liberty goes so does the
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:28.160]  prosperity and the folks if they cannot let you hand out stuff in downtown Austin or even
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.540]  told us you can't have a bumper sticker on your car and so I said well let me talk to
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:33.980]  the code enforcer instead of the cops I'm on the phone with the code enforcer who's
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:39.280]  ordering the cops around he goes Alex I'm a listener to I just I'm being ordered this
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:44.260]  my job and I said this is wrong and he goes I gotta tell you something else they don't
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:47.860]  want bumper stickers on your company car they you know they see that car parked down there
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:51.980]  and I said I said you're telling me in America I go where is it parked in a meter and I go
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.100]  is it legally parked he goes yeah and I go are my people blocking the right-of-way and
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:59.020]  he goes no the code says it's for like hot dog I said is it for like hot dog stands blocking
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:02.740]  the sidewalk he goes yep he goes no I know the the street team they're totally polite
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:07.140]  what they're doing has always been okay I'm told now to issue these tickets and next they're
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:14.180]  gonna be arrested and so I said well I gotta drive back from Galveston and I had to get
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:18.180]  in the car and drive back and then have a protest for him to back off and then my street
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:22.780]  team quit out of fear because when the cops did their job and wouldn't threaten the Constitution
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:27.380]  the goons were then sent I mean and next it'll be well you know it's good to have big muscle
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:32.620]  guys telling women they can't be on the street in America let's go to a current police officer
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:38.000]  in Maryland named Tom he's saying he's a police officer Tom what is your view on this maybe
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.500]  I'm an extremist maybe we shouldn't have free speech well good afternoon Alex I'm a retired
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:49.060]  police officer and it's despicable the kinds of things that I hear that you and your staff
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:57.220]  have undergone you spoke earlier today in the show about behavior that to me and those
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:03.500]  that I served with absolutely dishonorable and outrageous to hear those types of things
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:08.140]  what I haven't heard you report on and I'm very interested in though are the number of
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:12.980]  internal affairs complaints that you and your street team have filed against the various
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:17.700]  officers in these various departments it is important to file these even if you don't
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:23.780]  think you'll get a satisfactory outcome because at the very least you're getting these reports
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:28.460]  one record just like if you're tracking crime no no you're right and and and I always say
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:32.420]  we should be tougher with people I myself have a soft heart and don't even want to get
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:37.420]  them in trouble because I know the dirt bags according to them at South by Southwest ordered
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:41.180]  it my only concern I went and talked to him and some of them apologized later and posed
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:45.460]  for photos they said look we were ordered to and they're like little kids you know the
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:49.980]  cops I knew growing up you know in Dallas were like tough guys and stuff I don't get
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:55.100]  how and would never do something like that but but I I hear your point about make about
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:00.120]  doing that so there at least there's a record of it you've got to file the complaint even
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:04.700]  if you feel like you don't want to give someone in trouble it's got to go on record it's not
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:10.180]  necessarily going to cost someone their job but it's the first line of defense and stopping
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:13.860]  this sort of behavior why do you think America is getting like this are they getting ready
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:21.660]  to really pull the plug I hope that's not the case I think that as with any situation
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:28.100]  where you have an organization that has power you're going to have them pushing the limits
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:34.900]  and you have to have on the reverse side and that's push back push back you've got to have
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:40.140]  that push back exactly yeah I mean free people are free because they stand up the reason
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:44.100]  we have freedom is our ancestors stood up anything else you'd like to add sir I'll leave
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:50.780]  you with this I think the more peaceful pushback and dialogue that we Liberty minded folks
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:56.860]  can engage in the less likely we'll have of any type of implosion that so many I agree
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:01.620]  we're going to talk about that when we come back more call straight ahead Alex Jones here

[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:56.140]  their own laws and are now taking at least 10 out of people's bank accounts in cyprus
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:34:03.360]  arbitrarily right off the top to bail out themselves and they've created 1.5 quadrillion
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:09.080]  worldwide many many times all the real wealth in the world in fact real wealth worldwide
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:15.080]  it's not estimated to even be 100 trillion but they created 1.5 quadrillion i mean bernie

[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:29.660]  from pennsylvania but yeah i wanted to call um we're referring to a youtube video that
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:36.460]  i saw the other day okay about about this guy in australia right he was holding a flint
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:41.820]  a flintlock right before he was talking about all the new gun laws being proposed over here
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:46.540]  in the u.s and he was saying that he doesn't agree with them and he was talking about how
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:51.540]  they took all the guns in australia oh no no first they took the semi-auto saying that's
[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:57.620]  all they wanted then they took uh the bolt action and now they've set to ban single shots
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:02.980]  yes they're banning guns everywhere they've done this and then they deny that they want
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:09.020]  our guns uh louis yeah and he was talking about how a lot of the guns were from former
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:14.860]  military and they cried like when they took them all and crushed them and stuff that they
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:19.380]  that they had those guns all around the world and by the way the violent crime rate roughly
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:23.860]  tripled you can pull this up uh in the 15 years since they banned the guns and did you
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:28.740]  know the real crocodile dundee the guy that was based on was a real person he wouldn't
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:33.260]  give up his rifles the swat team came to his house and tried to kill him and he killed
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:38.020]  two of the cops and they killed him they've killed over a thousand aussies you can pull
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:42.980]  it up in u.s newspapers reported on it during the gun confiscation they will do it they've
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:49.020]  done it before and the un treaty is set for this month john carrey's backing it the secretary
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:54.560]  of state and they say that they want the civilian abolition of gun ownership abolition means
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:00.020]  the banning god bless you absolutely louis great point about how the globalists have
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:06.380]  control of chicago and new york total gun ban they want our guns by the way the nra
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:12.340]  president has come out uh there's a video up at info wars.com he went on fox news no
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:17.080]  he's executive director not the president wayne lapierre and has pointed out that the
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:22.620]  white house internally is freaking out that their gun grab has backfired and are hoping
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:26.900]  for another event to reverse it and that's what diane feinstein has said that's what
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:31.340]  michael morris said don't worry there'll be more events let's show the images of the dead
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:37.180]  kids to end the second amendment their goal as she said before mr and mrs america get
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:43.660]  ready to hand them in is to ban our guns as an act of domination i mean diane feinstein
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:47.680]  is the queen of insider trading she went to congress worth a couple hundred thousand dollars
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:52.540]  twenty years ago the senate and is now worth some estimates are 150 mil most are below
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:59.740]  100 mil about 80 mil her husband's a billionaire and got oh man it's it's bad uh let's go ahead
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:06.660]  let's talk to ryan and ryan is calling from texas uh so uh what you calling about today
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:15.180]  ryan hey alex hey buddy what's on your mind today i'm i'm great go ahead so you're a police
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:21.060]  officer currently that's correct um uh what i wanted to talk to you about actually was
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:27.540]  the tip-off i got back in october regarding the whole ammo shortage i have a buddy of
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:33.300]  mine he's an ffl dealer i got a call from him in october this is exactly what he told
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:37.380]  me he said i just had an fbi client of mine call up to order 30,000 rounds of two two
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:42.220]  three he questioned him he said it's a big order i can fill it but why do you need so
[01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:46.380]  much and he said this he said within a couple of months you won't be able to purchase it
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.500]  or it's going to be so expensive you won't be able to get your hands on it something's
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:54.620]  going down he wasn't sure what it was but he said that it had something to do with the
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:58.780]  obama presidency either he's going to declare martial law or he's going to try to confiscate
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:03.420]  guns and it's going to be back in october well again i happen to know a lot of federal
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:07.140]  firearms dealers let's leave it at that i happen to know some of the biggest manufacturers
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:13.380]  of firearms and ammunition the nra said over a year ago that well this was in the news
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:17.140]  people remember i mean it's no secret they said obama will try to ban guns we've been
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:21.660]  told now they've released that internal justice department memo two weeks ago where that was
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:26.620]  their plan even before the election and then new memos after and isn't it magic that all
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:33.820]  these perfect things happen but even fbi folks didn't know why their regional directors told
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:38.940]  them get ammo because the shortages even for police and federal agents they don't know
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:44.100]  where the two billion rounds are going there are shortages even for federal law enforcement
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:48.580]  no one knows where it's going now some of it hasn't even been delivered yet it's like
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:54.540]  it's designed to just absolutely throw a shoe into things and create shortages go ahead
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:59.340]  now that you're exactly right and the thing is that we've been told the same thing but
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:03.380]  way after that you know pick up on your own personal supply because our sergeants won't
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:07.340]  even address it you ask them about the shortage they won't even talk about it it's one of
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:11.500]  those things where you know they ignore the man behind the curtain type things are they
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:16.940]  being ordered to do that because i was asked by a cia uh asset i'll just leave it at that
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:22.020]  who well i shouldn't go any further than that uh it's an analyst for the cia who happens
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:26.100]  to be a talk show host i'll just leave it at that he said that he's interviewed a bunch
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:30.940]  of congressmen on and off air and they just flatly deny to him and that even when he's
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:36.420]  talking to cia liaisons they they say that doesn't exist even though it exists they've
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:41.220]  been ordered to say it doesn't exist and that's only done on warfare fronts that's what gibbs
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:46.180]  talked about you only blatantly lie even when you know it's a known lie when it's part of
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:51.720]  a military northcom operation if it's domestic and that's illegal so i mean what's your take
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:58.500]  on that well exactly that's exactly what the denasi propaganda so he said was tell a lie
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:02.860]  tell it big enough and tell it enough so people will believe it as far as our sergeants go
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:06.060]  they won't even get into why they won't talk about it because they don't even admit that
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:13.180]  it's real now you're absolutely right and i don't even know what to say uh at this point
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:20.740]  um i don't know what to say at this point it's it's just so crazy and and again even
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:25.780]  people in government are compartmentalized and don't know what's going on but separately
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:31.140]  it's hiding in plain view it's it's very bizarre this whole man behind the curtain thing and
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:34.740]  it's got and look the whole government's not bad there are people in every government level
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:38.580]  who are good americans who are upset about what's happening there are people in the eu that are good

[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:52.820]  a debate that neutralizes it but you let them get all this in place and then stage some event

[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:40.180]  to uphold the constitution of the united states those officers should have disobeyed and refused
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:47.300]  to follow any orders that violated the constitution and those big thugs from south by southwest they
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:51.620]  should have been arrested by those officers out there for bothering your employees that's all
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:55.460]  there is to it yeah well they said they were with south by southwest and they went and got
[01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:59.940]  the cops and the guys ran off but i mean it just shows first people couldn't believe it till we
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:04.340]  showed the video and photos online and i don't blame the public for thinking it wasn't true
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:09.460]  i mean how has it gotten to the point where some corporation can order the police around
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:15.860]  well they're not going to order me around nothing nor any of the officers or the deputies that work
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:21.140]  for my agency and i think you'll find that the majority of police officers in texas will tell
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:26.020]  a big organization to take a hike we've we've got a pair okay we've got some intestinal well
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:30.420]  no i found that in most areas i don't know how they got away with it uh what do you think about
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:36.020]  the billions of bullets that are public but that they're denying well i mean they can't take our
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:39.940]  guns they they're not gonna be able to take our guns away so they're gonna take the bullets
[01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:46.660]  that's what it is they took me three weeks to find a store that had a box of 38 specials
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:53.540]  for my off-duty weapon amazing all right good to hear from you joe be safe uh let's talk to uh

[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:32.180]  there on the ozarks hey alex uh actually i'm a former uh deputy out of boone county arkansas
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:38.580]  but uh as you know i moved up this way just to kind of get away from sure but uh i still have
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:43.940]  quite a few friends that are our deputies and you know in the police force and so forth and
[01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:48.900]  a lot of them through this area you know have you know watched what's been happening you know with
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:55.060]  the uh underground and stuff of course the ozarks are just honeycomb with uh caves a lot of
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:51:03.940]  underground uh bunkers and uh and so forth but uh you know it's it there's a lot of activity
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:09.620]  that's going on uh just up you know you and uh jesse ventura i think you know did a little
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:14.900]  special in this house that's up this way and uh the underground bunkers that are up near the
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:21.380]  springfield missouri area and then recently we found out that fema purchased the uh underground
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:26.900]  uh storage facility out of branson missouri oh yeah no i i i consulted on jesse ventura's tv
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:31.700]  show one of the episodes this year and they they confirm with the local police and others that it's
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:38.100]  the nsa the cia and that the guy that runs the house that's 72 000 square feet the new york
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:42.820]  times reported on it a behemoth vacation home rises in the ozarks it's built with like two
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:48.580]  foot thick concrete walls and they've confirmed it's a command base on top of underground bases
[01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:55.140]  obviously one guy from the nsa doesn't own it and that is one of the alternate governments now
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:52:03.060]  outside of norad in uh colorado springs colorada and camp david and site are uh in maryland and
[01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:07.700]  the question is what are they getting ready for out there uh the intel i've got is they've been
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:14.500]  moving anti-personnel weapons in which you don't have those to fight the russians in an icbm attack
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:21.700]  you move uh armored vehicles underground to defend it from some type of uh uprising and that is
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:26.260]  reportedly one of the safest areas in the country what do you think's happening i think that uh this
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:33.700]  is a safe haven you know it's right center in the middle part of the country and uh you know with
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:41.780]  some of the subs that they have that uh mal had out of uh korea you know they've got those new
[01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:46.980]  electric subs that can actually come close to the united states that's right the missile they can't
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:50.740]  quite make it right dead center of the state no they pull up and launch cruise missiles that's
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:53.940]  right matter of fact i don't know if you know but you can pull up on youtube there was a missile
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:58.500]  that was launched um oh no no no i mean even the former head of nasa came out and said that's an
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:04.900]  icbm the u.s tested one off their coast so they they detonated one with conventional munitions
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:09.780]  off san diego what was that three years ago yeah i think so it was uh and it was plainly you know
[01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:15.220]  they said it was a ups plane that uh yeah you know they didn't look at it yeah that was a submarine
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:19.060]  launch that's right not an icbm you're right it was launched by a sub about 10 miles off the coast
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:23.460]  good to hear from you yeah no it's on record that they're building bases all over the place
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:29.300]  and they've got black ops all over that area the ozarks and they've been getting in locals faces
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:34.980]  which is not the best move this country's in a lot of troubles all i can tell you i mean they
