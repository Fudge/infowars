[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:41.160]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen
[00:41.160 --> 00:47.920]  welcome to this October 1st 2008 worldwide transmission over Minnesota Governor Jesse
[00:47.920 --> 00:53.400]  Ventura will be joining us coming up in the next hour and he was going to announce this
[00:53.400 --> 01:02.880]  on my show going back a week ago today but time Warner put out a press release before
[01:02.880 --> 01:09.000]  he was able to come on the air here he thought they were going to be announcing it at the
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.640]  end of this week so he could announce it here today but it's really not that big of a deal
[01:13.640 --> 01:21.000]  but it's interesting that he's doing a TV pilot for a TV pilot that was originally
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.840]  pitched in my name by just a production company but I'm glad to see it's getting done he's
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.960]  also involved in some other things but I don't know we're going to talk about that today on
[01:31.960 --> 01:36.080]  air with him in one hour we'll see if Jesse Ventura wants to get into that we also have
[01:36.080 --> 01:43.580]  a huge guest of the same level as Jesse Ventura coming on the radio show for their maiden
[01:43.580 --> 01:56.040]  virgin voyage with us today and that is coming up in a few hours so we'll tell you a little
[01:56.040 --> 02:05.520]  bit more about that later obviously in the meantime I want to cover financial news and
[02:05.520 --> 02:12.160]  I do want to give the listeners a chance to chime in on all the different flavors of propaganda
[02:12.160 --> 02:18.160]  the different types of propaganda and brainwashing we're seeing from the controlled corporate
[02:18.160 --> 02:29.280]  media I again watched television for about 45 minutes this morning in the garage while
[02:29.280 --> 02:35.840]  I was working out now I watched television through clips online and maybe once a week
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.560]  I'll watch a movie on TV but not even really anymore I never have time but but I really
[02:40.560 --> 02:47.720]  don't watch news itself from you know show to show program to program I normally listen
[02:47.720 --> 02:54.720]  to music when I'm working out but lately because of the financial crisis is going on I want
[02:54.720 --> 03:01.600]  to really watch what the enemy's up to and let me tell you it is just unbelievable off
[03:01.600 --> 03:10.280]  the charts to watch the line the twisting the spinning it would the terrorizing of the
[03:10.280 --> 03:19.800]  public the blaming the public with the 1.2 trillion stock market loss that we witnessed
[03:19.800 --> 03:28.880]  when the quote bailout failed on Monday and then hundreds of points again lost today a
[03:28.880 --> 03:37.160]  racing games that were made yesterday so at this point in time just look at the track
[03:37.160 --> 03:43.880]  record the mainstream media lies and spins they are owned by the very banks that created
[03:43.880 --> 03:51.520]  all of these fraudulent paper instruments that are based on nothing in most cases their
[03:51.520 --> 04:00.760]  tenuous connection to substance is to your 401k to your stocks to your bank account
[04:00.760 --> 04:04.440]  and to the fact that they are backed up in many cases by the federal government which
[04:04.440 --> 04:11.880]  is backed up by our sweat and toil we the faith and credit of the United States means
[04:11.880 --> 04:18.280]  look in the mirror means us the people you have these offshore globalist corporations
[04:18.280 --> 04:21.440]  that have engineered this whole thing and look I mean we're not tuning our horn here
[04:21.440 --> 04:27.760]  people better pay attention to this radio show and Ron Paul and a few others who for
[04:27.760 --> 04:31.880]  Ron Paul for 30 years this radio show for at least a decade we've been on this financial
[04:31.880 --> 04:38.600]  derivatives bubble because as soon as they created these fraudulent instruments and tied
[04:38.600 --> 04:44.280]  them to the economy to the real economy anyone who wasn't on the payroll the new world order
[04:44.280 --> 04:49.480]  said my god this is this is this is total servitude this is intention servitude they're
[04:49.480 --> 04:54.680]  gearing up and now we see that process I'm gonna break it down and take your phone calls

[05:05.040 --> 05:10.280]  troops I went to ground here and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did truth

[09:19.360 --> 09:26.760]  our message is becoming completely mainstream truth goes through three phases first it's
[09:26.760 --> 09:35.560]  ignored then it is attacked and ridiculed then it is universally accepted as fact but
[09:35.560 --> 09:40.080]  I can't be pleased with that because at the end of the day we still have the new world
[09:40.080 --> 09:47.320]  order the trillion pound gorilla losing green slimes sitting on top of us beating us in
[09:47.320 --> 09:52.760]  the head with their propaganda 24 seven telling us how much they love us and foisting hundreds
[09:52.760 --> 10:05.160]  of gorgeous info babes with glistening lipstick spewing lies there are so many lies they are
[10:05.160 --> 10:09.960]  saying that if the bailout package doesn't pass again today that the market will then
[10:09.960 --> 10:16.840]  again plunge over a trillion dollars which on its face is economic terrorism they are
[10:16.840 --> 10:25.360]  putting out the monumental lie this was all caused by subprime mortgages no the global
[10:25.360 --> 10:34.800]  controllers of the financial system two and a half years ago at Bilderberg meeting in
[10:34.800 --> 10:42.000]  Canada that we covered and we went on air during June during Bilderberg and after and
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.680]  I went on coast to coast AM and we wrote news articles stating on the record that the private
[10:47.680 --> 10:54.700]  banks are now going to pop the global derivatives bubble starting with subprime mortgages to
[10:54.700 --> 10:59.560]  consolidate smaller banks and the financial architecture of the world they will then offer
[10:59.560 --> 11:06.000]  as a solution after they engineered the crisis they are the authors of it that they would
[11:06.000 --> 11:17.160]  then call for a world government run and regulated by the a small inside group of banks that
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.440]  has now been called for in the financial times of London it has been called for in their
[11:21.440 --> 11:32.760]  spiegel it has been called for by Chancellor Merkel it has been called for by Prime Minister
[11:32.760 --> 11:37.320]  Brown it has been called for by Bush it has been called for in the Wall Street Journal
[11:37.320 --> 11:45.360]  it has been called for hundreds of places exactly what we told you exactly precisely
[11:45.360 --> 11:49.920]  and we said within three years what I said what Jim Tucker said by the way I just remembered
[11:49.920 --> 11:56.160]  let's get Jim Tucker on and I know that Esteline just had some twins I believe and that's why
[11:56.160 --> 11:59.160]  I've been doing interviews but we need to just make them come on air and take the credit
[11:59.160 --> 12:04.120]  for being just Pulitzer prize winners they should be Pulitzer prize winners in fact
[12:04.120 --> 12:10.000]  they really have the sources they really broke that we just conduit it here first on air
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.240]  but what does that say about us being absolutely completely totally a hundred percent right
[12:17.240 --> 12:28.360]  what does that say it says that the Bilderberg group does run the world that's what it says
[12:28.360 --> 12:37.440]  because all we reported to you was what we basically well in some cases stole out of
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.120]  their meeting I don't want to get into too many details and I wasn't involved in it but
[12:41.120 --> 12:46.800]  Jim and others brag about stealing documents and papers and talking to hotel staff before
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.960]  the meetings are held there and the hotel staff always says no and then they hear the
[12:50.960 --> 12:54.480]  evil as they serve these people for three days they immediately come and say here's
[12:54.480 --> 12:57.840]  everything oh my god these people are pure evil they're talking about exterminating
[12:57.840 --> 13:01.320]  eighty percent of us they're talking about world government oh my god they are evil
[13:01.320 --> 13:10.920]  like you said let me you know I got it all for you you understand how big that is that
[13:10.920 --> 13:17.320]  we have people of courage like Jim Tucker and Daniel Lester one and my self to a lesser
[13:17.320 --> 13:24.480]  degree and many others who go and get arrested detained shot at Jim's been shot at threatened
[13:24.480 --> 13:28.920]  with prison I've been threatened with president they were gonna set me up put me in prison
[13:28.920 --> 13:39.600]  I mean screaming at me for hours after hours after hours locked up in a little cage in
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.800]  Canada remember it made the newspapers all over the country the only reason they had
[13:43.800 --> 13:52.240]  to release me because Jim Tucker we were able to get a call to him and he was able to get
[13:52.240 --> 13:59.880]  with the cbc locally and get down there where we were being held and they enjoyed having
[13:59.880 --> 14:02.880]  his cornered in there they enjoyed laughing at us and telling us how they were gonna set
[14:02.880 --> 14:12.760]  us up and send us to prison imagine those those customs police loving the service system
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.600]  that is going to destroy their entire future and bring in neo serfdom and feudalism you
[14:17.600 --> 14:24.480]  know we had a guest on yesterday TV presenter in England Max Kaiser and he drew to my attention
[14:24.480 --> 14:27.920]  things that I wasn't even aware of and then I googled them and sure enough it was true
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.960]  did you know that Warren Buffett and a whole bunch of other people have been bragging saying
[14:31.960 --> 14:39.280]  America is going to be a feudal state neo feudalism neo serfdom term we've used for more than
[14:39.280 --> 14:46.360]  a decade they're using that term I didn't even see I don't even know the full magnitude
[14:46.360 --> 15:01.600]  it's worse than we say I keep warning listeners it's worse than we say far worse and we should
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.800]  be talking about what the depression is going to look like in this country now we're hearing
[15:07.800 --> 15:13.360]  a lot of lies I also monitored San Antonio radio news talk I read I monitored Austin
[15:13.360 --> 15:18.440]  news talk and Dallas news talk this morning and driving into work and it was the same
[15:18.440 --> 15:28.720]  thing that I saw on CNBC MSNBC Fox CNN CNN headline news the same fear mongering I saw
[15:28.720 --> 15:34.880]  when I flipped over to C-span just spot checking it I flipped from channel to channel the same
[15:34.880 --> 15:42.440]  thing oh you know one presenter was saying on CNBC one of the info babes she was saying
[15:42.440 --> 15:46.800]  oh I was in an airport and saw people cheering when the bailout felt Monday but then I was
[15:46.800 --> 15:51.080]  stuck there for an hour and saw them getting upset as they saw the market plunging and
[15:51.080 --> 15:57.080]  they were laughing at the viewers terrorizing them saying oh this is going to pass now because
[15:57.080 --> 16:03.840]  you've learned your lesson and so they will throw according to Bloomberg and other financial
[16:03.840 --> 16:09.400]  publications five trillion is what it says it gets rid of any fractional reserve bankings
[16:09.400 --> 16:17.280]  where they can't leverage tend to one fiat derivatives and loans now it's unlimited but
[16:17.280 --> 16:23.280]  only by a select group of private shareholders in global central banks and so that means
[16:23.280 --> 16:29.200]  they're going to be able to with completely rig rules not even the illusion of the market
[16:29.200 --> 16:34.800]  and the credit system not being rigged buy up and take over with regulators and the money
[16:34.800 --> 16:38.800]  they're going to have the fiat currency what's left of the financial system and insurance
[16:38.800 --> 16:44.360]  companies and other real corporations in the real economy what they call mainstream this
[16:44.360 --> 16:53.760]  is military takeover this is a financial staged terror attack and we told you this in June
[16:53.760 --> 16:58.040]  of two thousand and six and it's covered in end game it's covered in the extras from end
[16:58.040 --> 17:03.520]  game that's been out for a year and a half and this whole crisis supposedly started a
[17:03.520 --> 17:08.320]  year and three months ago so even before the subprime thing happened we told you a year
[17:08.320 --> 17:15.640]  before that and put a film out months before detailing it all and I have to hear these
[17:15.640 --> 17:22.800]  people that are part of this neocon new world order government loving corporate loving culture
[17:22.800 --> 17:28.400]  on talk radio going oh you want to stand up former conservative talk show host oh you
[17:28.400 --> 17:32.360]  want to stand up and say no to the bailout well you're going to be in a depression then
[17:32.360 --> 17:36.720]  and now they can say the depression is caused by the American people not bailing things
[17:36.720 --> 17:41.000]  out on Monday even if they do the bailout today or tomorrow next week it'll always be
[17:41.000 --> 17:48.720]  blamed like smooth hauling claiming that tariffs that were placed after the depression started
[17:48.720 --> 17:53.640]  started months into the crash they blamed it on that and now the very enemy media owned
[17:53.640 --> 17:56.560]  by the bankers that are doing all this are going to say it was done by the American
[17:56.560 --> 18:02.200]  people and people that lied on their mortgage applications that's certainly a very small
[18:02.200 --> 18:06.880]  part of it and showed the systemic culture of corruption from the top down but that is
[18:06.880 --> 18:21.280]  the tail wagging the gigantic dog we're gonna go live at prisonplanet.tv in about 42 minutes
[18:21.280 --> 18:26.240]  when Jesse Ventura joins us we're gonna be live through out most of the show and when
[18:26.240 --> 18:34.160]  our special guest joins us at two Ventura at noon in the second hour they're now our
[18:34.160 --> 18:44.640]  phone calls after that and then the special guest I like surprises I know you like surprises
[18:44.640 --> 18:52.560]  so that's coming up but it's bittersweet the fact that I have major magazine editors calling
[18:52.560 --> 18:56.640]  me up saying I've been listening to you for years I can't believe it's all true you're
[18:56.640 --> 19:00.480]  right the fact that I have pretty big time CEOs who are in the real economy calling
[19:00.480 --> 19:05.680]  me saying you know by that I don't mean a hundred billion dollar companies but billion
[19:05.680 --> 19:08.320]  dollar companies calling and saying I didn't believe you but everything you said is true
[19:08.320 --> 19:15.360]  you're right this is a daily on a daily basis now the fact that so many people are now finally
[19:15.360 --> 19:19.640]  paying attention is a very positive thing but we're now behind the eight ball we're
[19:19.640 --> 19:25.040]  now late in the game it's kind of like the dam broke and I live 10 miles up and I got
[19:25.040 --> 19:29.120]  on my radio and radio down to the town below I should the dam just broke 20 feet of fast
[19:29.120 --> 19:32.960]  moving water coming it'll be there in 10 minutes and now people laughed at me but now they
[19:32.960 --> 19:37.560]  walked outside finally and they see the water rushing quarter mile away they're going oh
[19:37.560 --> 19:44.880]  my god it's true the water's coming but there's still people denying the water's coming even
[19:44.880 --> 19:51.800]  as it begins to overflow their houses we're gonna come back take phone calls from a whole

[24:25.120 --> 24:34.720]  be four pacific but the bailout itself is a diversion and distraction financially what
[24:34.720 --> 24:40.800]  it gives the Treasury is unlimited fractional reserve banking no limit on fiat imaginary
[24:40.800 --> 24:47.120]  money they can create and then tied to your bank account to the currency and so this signals
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.720]  an absolute death of the dollar now we're seeing something happen right now not only
[24:51.720 --> 24:57.880]  is the dollar plunging the euro is collapsing and we've always talked about this in the
[24:57.880 --> 25:02.720]  economy that on this will be worldwide other currencies are going to drop in value what
[25:02.720 --> 25:08.160]  is a drop in value it means an inflation of the currency because they're involved in
[25:08.160 --> 25:12.760]  the same fractional reserve system it's simple a bunch of private bankers came and bought
[25:12.760 --> 25:19.400]  off politicians in 1913 here they did it night in 1815 in England and even earlier in France
[25:19.400 --> 25:27.120]  and areas of what's Germany and Austria today and they just created a scam where they can
[25:27.120 --> 25:32.040]  issue basically all the currency they want or all the paper they want well but normally
[25:32.040 --> 25:36.520]  their rule was 10 to 1 9 to 1 some countries had higher some had lower some countries
[25:36.520 --> 25:42.000]  8 to 1 some 10 to 1 some countries 20 to 1 generally 3rd world nations do 20 to 1 and
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.240]  of course those are banana boat republics and well known for their corruption and then
[25:46.240 --> 25:50.480]  confidence is lost in societies falling to disarray and everything falls apart well that's
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.880]  what the elite have said they want they want to destroy the middle class and so this bailout
[25:56.880 --> 26:04.000]  only signals more devaluation regardless and they plan to take it out of our hides let's
[26:04.000 --> 26:12.040]  go to work Bart Martin Josh Frank and others work from Texas go ahead I Alex I'd like
[26:12.040 --> 26:19.800]  to sort of finish what I was saying yesterday if I may I believe that capitalism is time
[26:19.800 --> 26:26.600]  release fascism because even with constitutional money the percentage that the wealthy control
[26:26.600 --> 26:33.840]  ever increases and as that increases and they choke off the economy and then when that happens
[26:33.840 --> 26:39.160]  you have a collapse and it doesn't even matter if the money is constitutional sure fractional
[26:39.160 --> 26:44.840]  reserve banking just give them another tool that makes it faster but I think even if you
[26:44.840 --> 26:49.680]  take that tool away it's just going to take longer for the collapse to have sir sir this
[26:49.680 --> 26:57.760]  is not capitalism that we're watching this is a rigged scam by a sequestered upper level
[26:57.760 --> 27:07.560]  economy controlled by private banking institutions and so it's a rigged economy designed for
[27:07.560 --> 27:15.200]  fraud this is not the term they call capitalism or free market but a free market money is
[27:15.200 --> 27:21.480]  a dirty game and so then if you say that you're going to have no rules on a dirty game it's
[27:21.480 --> 27:25.320]  just going to get worse well no one said there shouldn't be quote rules but they actually
[27:25.320 --> 27:31.760]  use the rules to shut down their competition and then secure the the central crime syndicates
[27:31.760 --> 27:36.720]  operation but but you you've called over the years repeatedly saying that you have an economic
[27:36.720 --> 27:43.640]  model so just briefly explain to me roark your economic model of quote free manufacturing
[27:43.640 --> 27:51.760]  well you know it if there is no money I think everyone would have to work capitalism forces
[27:51.760 --> 27:59.080]  you to work indirectly and if everyone works and companies just fill demand if the stores
[27:59.080 --> 28:06.400]  are just stocked and you just go and pick stuff up I think it's possible to make it work yeah
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.200]  it would be a big stretch for everyone mentally what are you talking about I mean it's it's
[28:11.200 --> 28:18.600]  it's so infantile roark and we it's not we take your call that isn't how that operates
[28:18.600 --> 28:24.760]  you can have listen I appreciate your call I I just can't I just can't do it I'm sorry
[28:24.760 --> 28:33.560]  okay you can have save the designs for a cotton gin and put that out for free but somebody's
[28:33.560 --> 28:41.400]  got to pay for the paper and the press to print the designs of the cotton gin on the
[28:41.400 --> 28:50.600]  paper okay so that's about as close to a free system as you can get but then to build the
[28:50.600 --> 28:57.000]  cotton gin not just get the free plans because yesterday you brought this up and the guy
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.840]  we had on said oh yeah like Linux or open-source software but still you've got to have technicians
[29:01.840 --> 29:06.440]  to run it to build it to control it they've got to get something back to be able to live
[29:06.440 --> 29:14.200]  so they have time to build that and maintain that for you okay so let's say it's 1870
[29:14.200 --> 29:19.760]  and you live in east Texas and you you want to and you own a piece of property but under
[29:19.760 --> 29:25.480]  the system I guess you couldn't and you want to have a cotton gin let's say you have free
[29:25.480 --> 29:31.480]  plans to build a cotton gin you still got to find a blacksmith to build the parts for
[29:31.480 --> 29:38.160]  you you still got to have operators for the cotton gin you got to somehow pay them everything's
[29:38.160 --> 29:45.240]  just free in the stores you just I mean we have to have agreed upon modes of exchange
[29:45.240 --> 29:54.920]  God help us we'll be back with more calls we're on the March the Empire's on the run

[33:09.120 --> 33:16.800]  we just had a caller and you just joined us named rork in texas and this is really an
[33:16.800 --> 33:25.320]  illustration of why the elite can engage in so many flagrant crimes at every level of
[33:25.320 --> 33:29.960]  society and every facet of society and it's because even people that are trying to be
[33:29.960 --> 33:35.080]  informed even people that listen to this show for years calls every six months or so with
[33:35.080 --> 33:40.800]  the same statement don't understand i mean i can't even sell him on the truth i can't
[33:40.800 --> 33:48.200]  even explain it to him and and and the general public thinks this is capitalism the general
[33:48.200 --> 33:53.240]  public is now blaming capitalism for what's happening and that is could not be further
[33:53.240 --> 34:02.640]  from the truth but it's so hard to explain to people and then he says that's what marx
[34:02.640 --> 34:09.560]  and lennon said angles said the same thing that oh they'll just be everything free at
[34:09.560 --> 34:14.840]  the stores how do you think you get people to mine the materials out of the ground to
[34:14.840 --> 34:20.880]  build the factories to pay the employees to build the roads to the factories to power
[34:20.880 --> 34:27.960]  the factories to then package and promote and advertise the products and then ship them
[34:27.960 --> 34:32.480]  to the stores and put the lights on and build the stores and pay the employees and have
[34:32.480 --> 34:38.600]  the policies we are a complex society have you have you looked at a city from the air
[34:38.600 --> 34:44.600]  here stood up on top of mountain and you know look down on a city how complex it is yes
[34:44.600 --> 34:50.160]  you can have a hunter gatherer society of bands of twenty to fifty people maximum where
[34:50.160 --> 34:56.080]  but you still got a tribal chief normally the person that has the best intuition the
[34:56.080 --> 35:00.880]  best six cents historically in the very primitive hunter gatherer societies not even a lot of
[35:00.880 --> 35:08.080]  times the strongest but you know who who just knew when to move on who understood where
[35:08.080 --> 35:17.720]  the game of the animals to be hunted would be the individuals that just had it and then
[35:17.720 --> 35:22.720]  they would become leaders of the small band they would end up breeding with the majority
[35:22.720 --> 35:29.120]  of the women and you would have an advancement in the stronger more intelligent intellect
[35:29.120 --> 35:36.440]  genetics being passed on and call it whatever you want that you know that's a fact that's
[35:36.440 --> 35:43.200]  how that works it's called breeding the new water understands that's they try to take
[35:43.200 --> 35:50.640]  control of that they call it eugenics and they have effectively with chemicals poison
[35:50.640 --> 35:54.720]  the public this is all stated in the water in the food and so you know we make fun of
[35:54.720 --> 35:59.120]  the public when we we laugh at ourselves how stupid we are how you know I mean it's not
[35:59.120 --> 36:07.000]  just ignorant we're stupid because we're brain damaged and so people who would be incredibly
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.840]  intelligent are just intelligent people that would just be intelligent are average people
[36:12.840 --> 36:17.520]  that would be average are stupid are ignorant and people that would have just been a low
[36:17.520 --> 36:28.120]  grade moron are retarded and it's a fact ladies and gentlemen it is an absolute fact
[36:28.120 --> 36:33.680]  you know my dad drank well water growing up and he was the top of his class that's not
[36:33.680 --> 36:39.160]  true he was in band and football and did so many extracurricular activities he was salutatory
[36:39.160 --> 36:43.040]  and then he was you know judge like the top you know in the top six smartest in a big
[36:43.040 --> 36:47.640]  federal government study in Texas all that kind of stuff and the other side of my family
[36:47.640 --> 36:52.160]  is all smart and let me tell you something those older people in test scores and everything
[36:52.160 --> 36:58.000]  not just in how much work they put in they are innately smarter and have more brain power
[36:58.000 --> 37:05.240]  than I do and it's because I grew up in Dallas with heavy two parts per million sodium fluoridation
[37:05.240 --> 37:12.120]  and the other fluorides they add you understand that and by the way the fluoride and the mercury
[37:12.120 --> 37:19.800]  is altering our DNA it is damaging it as it's being passed down so I'm here to tell you
[37:19.800 --> 37:26.200]  I'm damaged goods and so are you and the sooner you stop giving that stuff to your kids the
[37:26.200 --> 37:33.560]  better you had a bunch of alcohol on top of it a bunch of marijuana a bunch of prosact
[37:33.560 --> 37:42.320]  God help your brains now through education through mental exercises through study you
[37:42.320 --> 37:46.520]  can regain much of what you would have been but you're going to have to work harder you're
[37:46.520 --> 37:53.040]  going to have to stay focused because I chose to study the new world order because I chose
[37:53.040 --> 37:59.840]  to study the real political system of the planet whereas I'm not as good as mathematics
[37:59.840 --> 38:05.640]  or spelling or or or working on machinery or any of that as some of my family that wasn't
[38:05.640 --> 38:11.160]  brain damaged by the chemical weapons in the water the group on farms I now have greater
[38:11.160 --> 38:17.320]  knowledge than them and I have developed systems of thinking which have advanced me past them
[38:17.320 --> 38:25.520]  but imagine how much further I would be if I hadn't been chemically damaged the mind
[38:25.520 --> 38:31.880]  is incredible and the new world order knows that ladies and gentlemen and they don't want
[38:31.880 --> 38:34.320]  you to be able to grasp what they're doing now I'm going to briefly explain something
[38:34.320 --> 38:42.720]  to your work then I'm going to Bart Martin Josh Frank and others we got Jesse Ventura
[38:42.720 --> 39:01.040]  coming up in 22 minutes all right aka James Janos the elite I understand work you heard
[39:01.040 --> 39:06.200]  about free supply you heard about mechanized robotic factories so advanced that you will
[39:06.200 --> 39:14.320]  be able to lay around on your hind end all day and that is actually coming in the manufacturing
[39:14.320 --> 39:20.360]  industrial singularity there will be many singularities different steps towards the
[39:20.360 --> 39:25.760]  true singularity which is a mathematical fact and you better not want the singularity because
[39:25.760 --> 39:30.240]  it means the end of the species and it means not even be able to grasp you know there aren't
[39:30.240 --> 39:34.160]  there is no one on the earth who can grasp all the computer technological systems and
[39:34.160 --> 39:40.400]  how they interface and how they run and what's happened is humans and human technicians and
[39:40.400 --> 39:49.320]  computer scientists man and oversee with an organic augmentation the computing systems
[39:49.320 --> 39:54.760]  and the artificial neural networks that have been created and they oversee their different
[39:54.760 --> 40:00.200]  sciences and then attempt to merge those together and are building computer systems that compute
[40:00.200 --> 40:05.040]  and integrate and design other computers and it's basically already with the technology
[40:05.040 --> 40:11.000]  we know about not just the suppressed technology but the technology that we know about basically
[40:11.000 --> 40:16.920]  already out of human hands we might if we had a full conscience movement towards full
[40:16.920 --> 40:23.160]  disclosure and investigation and control be able to slow this down you know in the past
[40:23.160 --> 40:29.000]  it took a hundred years for major developments to happen now it's happening every six months
[40:29.000 --> 40:35.840]  and so yes the elite made the decision as early as I can tell about 80 years ago that manufacturing
[40:35.840 --> 40:47.080]  in the future and they even successfully predicted when that would be turn to the new century
[40:47.080 --> 40:52.720]  that they will be able to build robotic mind systems robot robotic delivery systems that
[40:52.720 --> 41:03.660]  will even deliver the components of minds automatic track laying for the trains automatic
[41:03.660 --> 41:11.120]  computerized work gangs that will still have some human technicians and programmed machines
[41:11.120 --> 41:16.600]  robots that will also service those but then the elite said well why do we need to keep
[41:16.600 --> 41:19.920]  building all this and keep making all of this for the general public there are a bunch of
[41:19.920 --> 41:24.360]  scum there a bunch of trash in their words we need to get rid of them and that's why
[41:24.360 --> 41:27.600]  bill joy and others have written articles for wire magazine like why the future doesn't
[41:27.600 --> 41:32.160]  need us and bill joey's worth billions and billions of dollars he owns some micro systems
[41:32.160 --> 41:37.640]  he you know he goes to a big technology meeting with over 200 CEOs of technology companies
[41:37.640 --> 41:41.840]  and all they talk about is how there's going to be a singularity in the next 15 years and
[41:41.840 --> 41:48.560]  that was eight years ago and how the majority of the elite are leaning towards this is a
[41:48.560 --> 41:55.200]  public declaration towards the orderly extermination of the mass you're they're not going to just
[41:55.200 --> 42:00.840]  have big robotic factories making brain pods you know iPods that go the plug right into
[42:00.840 --> 42:06.080]  your head right through the neural network right through your eyes they're not going
[42:06.080 --> 42:11.520]  to get you're not going to have that you're not going to get that you're not going to
[42:11.520 --> 42:15.200]  get life extension technologies when there's six and a half billion going to be eight billion
[42:15.200 --> 42:19.120]  by the time they've really got that shirt up to extend life twenty thirty years longer
[42:19.120 --> 42:24.880]  than it is now and if you can do that then they know they're going to be able to reach
[42:24.880 --> 42:30.160]  systems that'll let them live to 200 not just 130 and then if you can live to 200 well they
[42:30.160 --> 42:33.880]  know they're going to have systems by then for what you'll call immortality now will
[42:33.880 --> 42:38.880]  that still be a human will it still have a soul no they say that they're going to merge
[42:38.880 --> 42:44.120]  our data into whoever's allowed to live into machines and the elites are going to have
[42:44.120 --> 42:52.280]  duplicates of themselves in fleshly bodies in computers in space probes people will make
[42:52.280 --> 43:00.840]  fun of the end of endgame where I quote top futurist and Nobel Prize winners saying that
[43:00.840 --> 43:03.880]  most of the elite when they have these meetings have had are going to leave a copy of themselves
[43:03.880 --> 43:08.640]  here but they want to explore and that they're going to basically have their consciousness
[43:08.640 --> 43:15.080]  put into hibernation and blast off for alpha centuries that's a galaxy for those that don't
[43:15.080 --> 43:21.360]  know they're saying this and whether that's possible or not whether they're really going
[43:21.360 --> 43:26.080]  to do that or not these people build giant computer companies they're worth hundreds
[43:26.080 --> 43:31.120]  of billions of dollars trillions total they designed the buildings the architecture the
[43:31.120 --> 43:38.240]  roads how things work they run things understand they've got their stuff together they're in
[43:38.240 --> 43:44.840]  power and they're arrogant and they see you watching football games and they see you fighting
[43:44.840 --> 43:49.520]  like white trash in your front yards and they see you stupidly buying the prozac ads and
[43:49.520 --> 43:54.960]  all the rest of it and going along with their scam and they say you don't have a right to
[43:54.960 --> 44:01.160]  live because you're so stupid you bought into what we did they claim that they have rules
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.720]  and that's why they tell you what they're going to do to you I've even been told that
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.760]  the great bond and in person by elitists that Alex we're glad you're there you know we believe
[44:09.760 --> 44:14.840]  that the slaves need to have a chance to know what we're going to do to them we you know
[44:14.840 --> 44:19.360]  our intellect is so much greater than you you people are so pathetic and slovenly that
[44:19.360 --> 44:24.720]  you know we want to give you a little head start we want to give you a little idea what
[44:24.720 --> 44:32.360]  we're going to do to you and you've got these self assured smiley faced fake tough guy men
[44:32.360 --> 44:42.120]  who are so into their false illusion of them being tough
[44:42.120 --> 44:46.360]  that they won't admit they're being enslaved to save themselves and their children and
[44:46.360 --> 44:52.920]  their wives and their futures and the women are so hogtied and so destroyed psychologically
[44:52.920 --> 45:02.800]  by watching Madison Avenue and the ramp walkers and the heroin chic 18 year old women that
[45:02.800 --> 45:10.320]  look like they're nine with skin and bone the women see that and they are very social
[45:10.320 --> 45:18.360]  creatures we all are but extremely intelligent but also extremely influenceable so are men
[45:18.360 --> 45:28.520]  but women it's unbelievable that that that gorgeous women all think they're ugly
[45:28.520 --> 45:33.480]  they don't know why men don't want them and they don't know why men like some voluptuous
[45:33.480 --> 45:40.800]  woman who's into herself and know she's got it you notice in the grassroots men like
[45:40.800 --> 45:50.120]  the strong you know goddess image the large breasts silky hair you know plump faces strong
[45:50.120 --> 45:58.040]  vibrant you know childbearing I am woman hear me roar and so now because the alternative
[45:58.040 --> 46:04.320]  media is taking over that is becoming the proper sex symbol but still women can't pull
[46:04.320 --> 46:12.040]  themselves away they're like no I'm ugly no I'm not good TV says so meanwhile there's
[46:12.040 --> 46:16.400]  genetic engineering toxic waste being dumped everywhere your children are being poisoned
[46:16.400 --> 46:21.320]  the government's gearing up tattletale squads and environmental squads and they're gonna
[46:21.320 --> 46:24.600]  have environmental checkpoints that's being announced and they're gonna control how much
[46:24.600 --> 46:28.200]  food you get and ration cards everything I told you years ago because it was in their
[46:28.200 --> 46:33.400]  own plans now they're rolling it out and the men are busy thumping their chest watching
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.640]  football and acting tough I'm not saying watching football is bad but I'm saying if that's your
[46:37.640 --> 46:43.400]  manliness you got a problem if that's all you are and men are into being stupid and
[46:43.400 --> 46:48.280]  into thinking it's funny and that's all been done socially and engineered into them I said
[46:48.280 --> 46:56.240]  I take calls I don't want to just rant here the point is folks that stop being in love
[46:56.240 --> 47:00.520]  with yourselves for five minutes and then you'll actually save yourselves stop looking
[47:00.520 --> 47:06.680]  in the mirror for five minutes men and women stop trying to act trendy and wear the right
[47:06.680 --> 47:11.120]  clothes or have the right tattoos I'm not bashing any of tattoos you know what I'm
[47:11.120 --> 47:17.360]  saying and actually be something real during the most critical point in human history that
[47:17.360 --> 47:23.760]  we're now entering the veneer of civilization is going to be burned off very fast and you're
[47:23.760 --> 47:30.760]  going to see what's under and in it and pretty okay the the bad in us is being turned loose
[47:30.760 --> 47:40.040]  the id the monsters of the id that's what the elite global new world order system is
[47:40.040 --> 47:46.520]  the technological enslavement grid that's what it is it is a charnel house of sex and
[47:46.520 --> 47:55.520]  death and murder and blood and poison and rotten flesh it is a it is a orgy pet for
[47:55.520 --> 48:10.400]  demons now get your heads screwed on okay get them screwed on straight and start caring
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.960]  about really matters and understand the TV is total psychological warfare the new shows
[48:15.960 --> 48:23.040]  at least there's some films and shows that come out you know because I've seen them behind
[48:23.040 --> 48:26.040]  the scenes where there are good people doing it and it barely slips through but then it
[48:26.040 --> 48:29.960]  doesn't get picked up or it doesn't get magnified or promoted and kind of falls on the wayside
[48:29.960 --> 48:34.120]  but the globalists don't have total control and let me warn everybody who works for this
[48:34.120 --> 48:38.680]  system you better join humanity against this and you'd better stop living in denial about
[48:38.680 --> 48:45.440]  what's happening Bart in Texas go ahead come ahead Bart alright well you know in the times
[48:45.440 --> 48:52.000]  of greatest darkness that's when an individual light can can really shine you know I've
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.160]  always read stories about the little dog in New Zealand that protected the kids and the
[48:56.160 --> 49:00.920]  Jewish professor at Virginia Tech that held the door while the students couldn't get out
[49:00.920 --> 49:06.560]  or the Polish nurse you know in World War two to save thousands of children from the
[49:06.560 --> 49:12.440]  Nazi death camps and the reality is is what's coming against us is very dark and it's very
[49:12.440 --> 49:18.160]  scary and 70 or 80% of the public's going to probably go along with it but the reality
[49:18.160 --> 49:24.680]  is is every Alex Jones every Bart every single truth lover and Patriot and you know it doesn't
[49:24.680 --> 49:29.320]  matter what your ideology or what your ideas even about the solutions what matters is is
[49:29.320 --> 49:34.560]  when the doors there and the doors being broken down are you going to stand up against the
[49:34.560 --> 49:38.720]  door are you going to throw your weight and your will and your life and the definition
[49:38.720 --> 49:44.120]  of who you are against that darkness and that's the choice that's coming for each and every
[49:44.120 --> 49:49.200]  one of us no matter how prepared or unprepared we are for this thing the reality is is we
[49:49.200 --> 49:53.800]  have to do a gut check we have to get right with God put our house in order and be ready
[49:53.800 --> 49:58.440]  to meet this thing and know that it's going to be chaotic and it's going to be frightening
[49:58.440 --> 50:01.880]  but this is what we've been called to and everyone that's listening to this show right
[50:01.880 --> 50:06.960]  now that's listening to my voice listening to your voice everyone needs to know that
[50:06.960 --> 50:11.560]  if we bow down to it then we're lost we have to cut loose when this thing comes and we
[50:11.560 --> 50:17.440]  have to be ready to meet it with everything that we are well they need to bring us into
[50:17.440 --> 50:21.680]  a depression so they can bring in the martial law but but sell it as oh we're doing this
[50:21.680 --> 50:26.320]  for economic reasons we're arresting people to keep the order you know don't worry you'll
[50:26.320 --> 50:30.000]  get your pension funds back if you just turn your neighbors in and we told people this
[50:30.000 --> 50:35.720]  years ago and it's now happening and you know my parents with the Germany earlier this year
[50:35.720 --> 50:41.200]  and they brought me back a famous well a big poster of a famous photo of an East German
[50:41.200 --> 50:46.480]  soldier at the barbed wire wall it was first going up and this little German boys trying
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.280]  to get through his parents just got through but he got hung in the barbed wire and the
[50:51.280 --> 50:56.760]  German the East German picks him up and let him go and of course they grabbed him and
[50:56.760 --> 51:02.160]  killed him the government did but the point is he kept his soul would you like to know

[54:49.240 --> 54:54.360]  keep pumping out saying why don't the people trust the politicians anymore why can't they
[54:54.360 --> 54:58.640]  just see this is what we need to do and it's because of the great awakening it's because
[54:58.640 --> 55:03.000]  of people like ron paul and yourself paul craig robertson everyone else that has begun
[55:03.000 --> 55:08.880]  inoculating the public with truth against this massive propaganda that's being spewed
[55:08.880 --> 55:12.560]  on them and all we're going to see you know every time it gets worse every time there's
[55:12.560 --> 55:16.480]  an escalation more people will wake up and that's why we just have to keep doing what
[55:16.480 --> 55:21.760]  we're all doing absolutely my friend anything else
[55:21.760 --> 55:26.760]  no alex just keep up the good fight you know all those patriots out there i have nothing
[55:26.760 --> 55:33.800]  but love for you all and just long live the republic death to the new world order appreciate
[55:33.800 --> 55:39.200]  the call let's go ahead and talk to martin in ohio martin you're on the air
[55:39.200 --> 55:46.040]  hey alex i just want to agree with you you know we need god's help this is bigger than
[55:46.040 --> 56:00.800]  all of us i've been watching all this week of this incredible fear mongering on on network
[56:00.800 --> 56:09.920]  and cable tv and it's amazing i probably wrote three different letters to my congressman
[56:09.920 --> 56:17.880]  and signed at least four different petitions to stop this stupid bailout and i thought
[56:17.880 --> 56:26.920]  we had the vampire nailed in its chest on monday but the zombies have arisen again
[56:26.920 --> 56:36.400]  and they're coming back i'm a gun owner i can't shoot that vampire what are we supposed
[56:36.400 --> 56:42.600]  to do well still the polls are showing right at 90 percent against the bailout so they're
[56:42.600 --> 56:45.960]  going to have the senate because they couldn't do it in the house pass it but then it's still
[56:45.960 --> 56:51.960]  going to go to the house and then you'll see more economic terrorism by the white house
[56:51.960 --> 56:57.520]  by the republican democratic party leadership saying okay if you don't pass this on thursday
[56:57.520 --> 57:02.360]  or you don't pass this on friday there's going to be a depression and then the plunge protection
[57:02.360 --> 57:06.280]  team controlled by the federal reserve will not prop the market up as they've been doing
[57:06.280 --> 57:10.760]  nothing hundreds of billions in a day and it will start sliding downward but remember
[57:10.760 --> 57:14.880]  they engineered all this and now they're like a bank robber where the cops have caught them
[57:14.880 --> 57:19.520]  in the bank and he grabs the attendant the teller and puts a gun to her head and says
[57:19.520 --> 57:24.600]  do what i say or she's going to die it's completely transparent that they're engaged in financial
[57:24.600 --> 57:30.040]  terrorism and that by terrorizing the market they're driving it down not just by refusing
[57:30.040 --> 57:35.960]  to prop it up so again it isn't even the 700 billion that's a red herring it is the immunity
[57:35.960 --> 57:41.880]  it is the new powers the treasury gets that is what they're after the problem is we have
[57:41.880 --> 57:47.960]  no cops in this country i hear you and i appreciate your call oh hey john i wanted to tell you

[1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:37.560]  with us hi alex great to be here looking forward to coming down to texas at the end of october
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:41.640]  absolutely and before this hour ends i'll tell people specifically about that event out of the
[1:00:41.640 --> 1:00:46.360]  gates here i didn't do any pre-interview what do you think's most important to start off the uh
[1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:54.120]  the hour with sir uh... you know i i i i i i don't know really i guess the economy right now of
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:01:01.160]  which you know i'm paying uh... i think all of us are paying attention to it trying i guess to figure
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:08.360]  out the dilemma is does a bot does a bailout worker doesn't it work you know you hear two sides to
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:15.160]  the story and it certainly put you in a predicament of picking the lesser of two evils which means
[1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:20.360]  you're still picking evil well let me throw in my two cents they are terrorizing the public with
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:26.520]  the president and others saying do this or they'll be a depression stuff like that from a treasury
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:31.400]  secretary and a president itself is firing a theater and then if you read the bailout plan it
[1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:36.920]  gives them total immunity it allows them to basically be separate from the government with no oversight
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:41.080]  so really i think the seven hundred billion itself is a distraction compared to the new powers it
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:46.680]  gives the treasury okay well i you know i'll trust you on that one you know i've been involved in
[1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:53.240]  other things the last week or so if that's the case then uh i fully do not support the bailout
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:59.480]  then i think it's ridiculous because this bailout if it indeed happens should come with so many
[1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:05.800]  rules and regulations that it's as sound as anything you can imagine because you can't be just taking
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:11.560]  money and handing people blank checks and telling them to fix it because that leaves virtually no
[1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:17.720]  accountability it's kind of like how the war was run in iraq we've certainly seen a lot of that we
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:23.320]  relied about the war we relied to about so many other issues and now the same crew let me take
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:29.320]  the conflict of interest we have we have henry polson who still has a big stake in goldman sacks
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:34.360]  directing tens of billions of dollars a week into his own company i mean how can he be doing that
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:41.880]  well you know i guess the best answer to that alex is that we've forgotten that the constitution
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:47.640]  today is a thing of the past uh it's a document that doesn't exist anymore which says there will
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:53.960]  be a separation of powers in between separate divisions and as i look at the country today
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:03:00.440]  i see that that isn't happening at all you know there that we aren't a separation of power anymore
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:06.680]  there seems to be no checks and balances whatsoever which is what the forefathers tried to put in
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:12.360]  when they when they created the constitution of the bill of rights was that making a system of
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:18.280]  checks and balances the problem is we've allowed people i mean i i kind of laughed the other day
[1:03:18.280 --> 1:03:24.440]  when i heard ralph made or referred to george bush's king george and a socialist i i i don't
[1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:31.080]  think ralph is that far off with with being able to say king george well i agree he's also pointed
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:35.320]  out that george bush is more socialist than any president we've ever had he's just giving an all
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:44.920]  of the elite right so yeah completely you know this is a uh a bailout of of uh wealthy and and
[1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:49.720]  their argument is that these are the people that provide the job so that it will have a trickle
[1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:57.320]  down effect to all of us which i have to assume will be some correctness to it but again how do
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:04.120]  you bail out the top and and trust what they're going to do you know clearly it i find it very
[1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:10.120]  interesting that the very people that wanted to deregulate everything are the ones now leaving
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:15.800]  the socialist bailout absolutely governor jesse ventura will also talk about his book that's been
[1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:21.320]  on the new york times bestseller list don't start the revolution without me he is our guest for the
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:32.280]  rest of the hour after this quick break stay with us a day unlike any bailout the top and and trust
[1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:38.200]  what they're going to do you know clearly i find it very interesting that the very people that
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:46.040]  wanted to deregulate everything are the ones now leaving the socialist bailout absolutely governor
[1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:51.000]  jesse ventura will also talk about his book that's been on the new york times bestseller list don't
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.480]  start the revolution without me he is our guest for the rest of the hour after this quick break stay

[1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:17.800]  m o's we have to look to the middle east we have to look to us on the ben laudan tabled enemies
[1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:22.440]  is the first 9 11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:27.720]  inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there are israelis again very much
[1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:34.760]  engaged in spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that some israeli citizens have been detained
[1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:40.040]  in laudan's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the saudi arabian connection
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:45.000]  the israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much much more

[1:06:04.840 --> 1:06:09.160]  in at night and checking on my children checking up on my wife making sure she has the things she
[1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:14.840]  needs but mostly providing for my family and knowing that they're secure that they feel comfortable

[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:23.560]  over and wrecking their lives i've always wanted to be a good provider and i'm not going to change
[1:06:23.560 --> 1:06:28.200]  that now just because the economy is in up evil and because there's a lot of political and social
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:33.720]  uncertainty and i hear about global famines and i see the escalating prices and gas and food and
[1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:37.800]  oil electricity is going to go way up until this winter hey i'm not going to sweat it i've done the
[1:06:37.800 --> 1:06:42.520]  right thing i got rid of a bunch of junk and toys out in the garage i converted that money into food
[1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:46.520]  that food's out there i've got a two or three year supply of food in the garage my family's secure i
[1:06:46.520 --> 1:06:50.520]  don't got to worry okay i do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of american security

[1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:05.240]  today you'll be glad you did david j smith for news watch magazine did you know that the rise of
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:11.080]  the sin time system is actually run behind the scenes by an invisible spirit being called satan
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:18.600]  the illuminati prefers to call him lucifer they worship him as if he were a god he is causing
[1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:24.920]  the blindness of our people as to what is happening to them they can't comprehend we will lose our
[1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:31.720]  national sovereignty our constitution our bill of rights and all freedoms to this christ rejecting
[1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:37.960]  new world order we'd like to help you understand why these things are happening offering you and
[1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:49.160]  the gcn radio network governor jesse ventura is our guest for the rest of the hour there's so many
[1:07:49.160 --> 1:07:54.360]  issues to be discussed and to talk about but finishing up with the bailout you know that
[1:07:55.080 --> 1:07:59.400]  the internationalists that run the banking system created these trillions and derivatives
[1:07:59.400 --> 1:08:05.400]  they tied it to our bank accounts our 401ks now they're saying come in and invest in this or
[1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:10.520]  basically it's all going to implode and these are the same interests that have all been moving
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:16.920]  offshore and so just in closing any other thoughts on what's currently happening with the bailout
[1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:22.920]  that they are set to vote on the senate today governor well you know again we have to watch
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:29.800]  my thing to tell all the american people is be vigilant man if you're not holding people's feet
[1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:33.960]  to the fire you're going to get bad government and that's the problem in this country as a whole
[1:08:33.960 --> 1:08:39.880]  is that we sit back we live in our own little worlds and we don't pay attention to what's
[1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:45.320]  going on with the nation and then by the time it catches us we're basically caught with our
[1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:50.760]  pants down because we haven't paid attention at all you know maybe the good the good thing that
[1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:57.080]  will come out of this whole bailout issue is that it will finally get the american people to rise up
[1:08:57.080 --> 1:09:02.120]  take their heads out of the sand and start paying attention alex yeah i don't want to go back to
[1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:05.960]  ancient history but i sure wish you were running for senate i don't blame you for not doing that
[1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:09.640]  because you've got some other you know ways of getting the word out to the people staying in
[1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:13.880]  the fight and we appreciate you not going back to mech you know back to mexico to surf we know
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:20.920]  that's uh probably quite beguiling but uh let's get into uh the fact that you are doing a pilot
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:24.440]  and i know you're doing some other stuff but i don't know how far you can go governor
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:31.000]  well i'm i'm doing actually i i've got uh possibly two three pilots in the hopper but uh
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:37.080]  i always like to tell people that i don't discuss them in great detail until the first
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:42.200]  check clears the bank uh that's that there's these are tv shows you know i and i'll be
[1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:48.360]  straight out front i am i do get paid when i do pilots uh like anyone else you're not a communist
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:55.320]  job like and i you know you got to earn a living and so but uh the pilot that we're doing now with
[1:09:55.320 --> 1:10:01.000]  the true tv network which is the formerly court tv is going to deal with conspiracies and and uh
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:07.640]  because they they conspiracies a fascinating beef are going on 20 to 25 years or better now you
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:13.400]  know starting off with the murder of john f kennedy and watching it evolve into everything else and
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:20.680]  now into the 9 11 conspiracies and uh so i think it's very intriguing stuff and even for people
[1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:27.880]  that don't believe or don't want to or or whatever it may be uh it's still very compelling and
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:33.400]  interesting and it's it and to me it's truly better than anything like tom clancy could write
[1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:39.880]  through anything like that because in many ways real life has more intrigue and mystery than
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:44.680]  than what anyone could make up in their own minds and write it down as a fiction writer you know a
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:50.520]  alex i have my own imagination so i don't really need to see somebody else's imagination or read
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:58.680]  about it but i do like i love history and it disturbs me greatly when uh history is not recorded
[1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:05.400]  correctly or or history is misled because then generations from now people will never get a
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:11.960]  clear picture of what went on and so uh you know delving into conspiracies i think is just great
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:18.920]  intrigue and great dramatic television and and uh not only will it hopefully inform you hopefully
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:25.080]  will entertain you at the same time well i know that the networks are very interested in this
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:31.000]  because i've been approached many times with similar uh similar ideas by the networks delving
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:37.640]  into the secret meetings infiltrating them uh you you you basically exposing what's going on
[1:11:37.640 --> 1:11:44.040]  underneath the rocks of government and corporations and i can't think of a think of a better person
[1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:51.000]  than uh the uh former underwater demolition and navy seal uh individual and a former governor
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:55.080]  out there uh you know running around covering all of this now uh
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:12:01.320]  uh let let wait wait alex let's not cheat me either now that sarah palin's out there i'm also a former
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:08.760]  mayor absolutely and former radio talk show host and movie star and professional wrestler
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:15.640]  well you know that's that's going to be the intrigue of the show uh as i said in the press
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:20.600]  release and you know i've been i've been a mayor i've been a governor now i'm gonna get a chance
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:26.440]  to be a detective and to be able to go seek out the truth and hopefully go question people and
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:33.160]  get some answers i guess you know if i could what's gonna happen in the show somewhat i guess for
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:39.160]  lack of any other better way to put it i'm going to become somewhat of a michael more of television
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:47.800]  i guess for this pilot but going after but but going after harder issues questions of i'm going
[1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:54.520]  to go ask questions people and i think my credibility proceeds me to where they can't take me lightly
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:59.720]  and i'm i'm going to go simply ask questions and alex when i was going through underwater
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:05.640]  demolition training when we got the second phase which was land warfare and demolition when i went
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:12.840]  through uh i had an instructor back then during the demolition phase at san clemente island and
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:19.800]  this instructor was a chief warrant officer and he impressed me very strongly with no reservations
[1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:26.440]  whatsoever that there is no such thing as a dumb question especially when you work with demolition
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:33.240]  because not only can you kill yourself you can kill your teammates along with you and so i've
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:39.480]  gone through life with that premise in mind but there is no dumb question a question certainly
[1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:45.880]  isn't dumb to someone if they don't understand it well that's dumb to them well that's what i've
[1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:51.400]  seen mainstream the way yeah yeah well that's the way that i've gone through life and that's
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:57.240]  what the essence of this tv show is going to be simply that there is no dumb question and every
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:03.240]  question deserves a honest answer to it and so i'm going to be out and about asking some
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:08.680]  you know solid questions that i certainly don't consider dumb and i don't think most people
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:13.880]  in america would either and uh we'll see what kind of answers we could get from people well
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:19.160]  that's what i was going to say is that that's what quote conspiracy theory is is the mainstream
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:24.520]  media and the dominant corporate culture anytime you say hey i think this bailout might not be
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:29.720]  a good idea they've been calling that a conspiracy theory or um you know i think that we need to
[1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:33.960]  question government more or have more checks and balances or there might be some corruption
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:40.200]  in government they call it a conspiracy theory so basically anybody questioning the official
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:45.480]  paradigm is called a conspiracy theorist and we've seen the same thing and going back to
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:50.440]  gallileo and he said that uh the earth i was orbiting the sun not the sun orbiting the earth
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:55.720]  you know they called him a a heretic and and is it that's what's so suspicious about 9 11
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:15:00.440]  is that you just ask questions and a stone wall and act so suspicious governor
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:09.480]  well and to me that's the question we're going to try to pursue why if what they've told us is true
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:15.400]  then you know there's that that old quote the truth will set you free well why would you
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:21.400]  have any fear of telling the truth alex i love to tell this story if i may when i was running
[1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:25.800]  for governor and at the time it was very much in the early part where there were six or seven
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:29.880]  candidates and they were holding debates throughout the state of minnesota we're much
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:35.080]  different than texas where in texas you get one debate up in minnesota generally you might get
[1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:42.120]  12 to 13 of them and uh uh when we were at this one particular debate early on we were seated
[1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:48.360]  alphabetical so naturally i'm over on the far side and i'll never forget all the other seven or
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:54.840]  eight other participants in the debate came in with stacks of papers and spin papers and all this
[1:15:54.840 --> 1:16:00.520]  stuff and i sat down with nothing and i remember there was a black woman a civilian sitting to
[1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:08.520]  my left and she quietly handed over to me a legal patent and i looked at her and i handed it back
[1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:14.680]  and i said no thanks and she said to me well don't you think you'll need that and i whispered back
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:20.600]  to her i said when you tell the truth you don't have to have a good memory and she looked at me
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:26.520]  and smiled and nodded she fully understood what i just said to her so in these debates i didn't
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:32.280]  need all that stuff because in essence every question i was going to be asked i would simply
[1:16:32.280 --> 1:16:39.960]  tell the truth and if you do that you don't need a good memory and so that's what we're taking forward
[1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:48.360]  here and people who who will stonewall 9 11 will why if what you're saying is true then simply tell
[1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:54.120]  the truth and let the chips fall where they may well governor i mean take the new niss report
[1:16:54.120 --> 1:17:00.680]  they have now retracted their previous five reasons building seven fell that 47 story structure for
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:06.760]  those that don't know that was hit by nothing that day and they've retracted that it was bad
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:12.520]  building construction they have retracted that a fuel tank blew up and did it they have retracted
[1:17:12.520 --> 1:17:18.440]  that the north tower fell and gouged out 25 percent of the south face of building seven and now
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:22.760]  they're saying a new phenomenon this is like seeing a leprechaun in your backyards a new
[1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:31.240]  phenomenon never before seen thermal expansion did this with 1200 1500 degrees cool fires made
[1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:36.440]  it symmetrically falls so they're just counting on the public not looking at the evidence and
[1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:40.680]  i'm here to tell everybody but i don't want to get your take on this the the the new niss report
[1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:48.680]  has completely and totally backfired on them well the last report i saw it correctly if i'm wrong
[1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:55.080]  the last report i saw from them on building seven stated that uh... they they said that that that
[1:17:55.080 --> 1:18:01.080]  the fuel in the building the diesel was not responsible they said the fire that destroyed
[1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:07.880]  the building was basically furniture and papers burning yes and then they say it's never happened
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:13.960]  before so the final line on the report that i saw and alex i looked at it started laughing
[1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:20.920]  i thought wait how could they possibly they're telling me that papers and furniture could
[1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:28.440]  cause a steel structured girdered building to uniformly collapse in seven seconds alex if
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:35.560]  that's the case then what is being done because clearly in that era of time when that building
[1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:40.360]  was built there were probably hundreds of others built throughout our country in the world
[1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:48.520]  shouldn't there be steps taken to ensure public safety if merely a fire with with furnishings
[1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:56.600]  and paper can cause the total collapse of a 49 story skyscraper what is being done about that
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:19:02.440]  well let me tell you uh... federal agencies then put out new guidelines the last month telling them
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:08.760]  to build buildings differently and major engineering firms uh... and and groups are now suing the
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:14.120]  federal government saying this isn't true this isn't reality and they're saying if this is the case
[1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:20.840]  that a big lighter would be able to burn down a building and we don't need control demolition
[1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:27.800]  companies anymore well and that's the truth i i said that from day one when i read this i said well
[1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:33.080]  the way they can prove this to me is the next time a building has to fall or come down
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:40.600]  let's simply go light it on fire let's not bother with any demo or any demolition professionals
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:47.880]  to come in let's simply like the building on fire there's certainly if if furniture and paper
[1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:54.040]  can make a building completely collapse in seven minutes we don't need any demolition do we alex
[1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:58.120]  no we don't gov enter i don't want you to go too far on the pilot you told me some of the behind
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:04.040]  the scenes and well let me tell you is it going to be powerful uh... but uh... the the particular
[1:20:04.040 --> 1:20:09.800]  angle you're going to be going at i think is uh... very effective and hasn't been done yet
[1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:12.840]  uh... you know even by a lot of alternative media much less the mainstream
[1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:17.960]  well you know that's one of the things we're looking forward to and i'm i i'm not going to
[1:20:17.960 --> 1:20:23.560]  spring it right now because uh... you know this is the mechanism we're going to go after it as
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:29.240]  and i hope that it is because the one thing i've always been accused of good or bad is
[1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:33.480]  they've always told me when i was a mayor or governor that no matter what issue came up that
[1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:40.360]  i had a i always had a unique perspective on how i view an issue and so we're going after a little
[1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:46.920]  different perspective of nine eleven here and uh... i think it will be very very entertaining as well
[1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:52.760]  as uh... uh... fact-finding and i think people are going to find it very very interesting if we
[1:20:52.760 --> 1:20:57.960]  see the light of day alex i've already warned every people all the people that i'm working with
[1:20:58.680 --> 1:21:04.040]  at the true network i've warned them that i still give it only a fifty fifty chance that
[1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:10.040]  this show will see the light of day well i uh... don't want to insert myself into the mix but
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:15.480]  yeah the exact same tv show was pitched to them right as it was turning into true tv we even have
[1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:21.960]  the the the the the the intro trailer to the uh... pilot that was made i never really talked about
[1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:27.160]  it on air because uh... i figured it wouldn't see the light of day but i think in the last year and
[1:21:27.160 --> 1:21:31.800]  a half so much has changed mister vintura and frankly you bring a lot more gravitas and alex
[1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:37.400]  jones does you know movie star governor you know all all these other issues i think i mean i had
[1:21:37.400 --> 1:21:41.160]  the executives tell me at three different networks including the one you're working with and i know
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:45.880]  you're working with several others too it's the same deal uh... and i had them tell me they go
[1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:50.440]  look we know this is what people want we know this will get ratings but then from up above
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:56.280]  you know up above programming even above you know that the vice presidents were the big money people
[1:21:56.280 --> 1:22:02.040]  saying we're not going to have that anti-new world order stuff on here we're not going to legitimize
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:08.440]  it and that's why the mainstream media is being delegitimized well all i can say is my
[1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:14.840]  my show coming up has nothing to do with the new world order no i understand it's with unsolved
[1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:21.320]  things that have happened yeah yeah you know this is just a case of uh... you know there's a there's
[1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:26.840]  a lot of questions that still loom out there and there's an end we're going to give both sides of
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:32.840]  the issue i want people to understand that too we're not just coming at this show with a perspective
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:38.120]  in mind that okay this is what we're going to promote this is the way we're going sure we are
[1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:45.000]  going to the people that it like that missed that do these reports they will have the opportunity
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:52.840]  to defend what they say and also well it will end up the viewer well viewer will see all things
[1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:58.440]  and ultimately the viewer will have to make up their own mind as to what they will do or do not
[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:03.240]  want to believe well government or a month my whole point is this to make it clear i think this is
[1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:09.320]  an idea whose time has come and i frankly can't think of a more perfect person uh... than than
[1:23:09.320 --> 1:23:15.400]  yourself very imposing and intelligent uh... basically stomping around going after bad guys
[1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:21.640]  and investigating things let let me have this alex here so everyone all your listeners will be
[1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:27.800]  clear uh... do you remember the great film philadelphia with denzel washington and tom hanks
[1:23:27.800 --> 1:23:33.240]  yes the uh... the uh... philadelphia where tom hanks is the lawyer who contracts aids
[1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:37.240]  yes and goes to denzel who's kind of a slip shot lawyer who
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:44.040]  advertises on tv that we always see him and he seeks him out to defend him in this major major
[1:23:44.040 --> 1:23:50.120]  case well the part i took home from that more than anything is also the attitude i'm going
[1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:56.360]  to bring to this show so that all your listeners will be clear on this there's a scene in there
[1:23:56.360 --> 1:24:03.800]  where denzel washington turns and says this word he says explain it to me like i'm a six-year-old
[1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:10.440]  do you remember that from the film yes he makes that statement explain this to me like i'm a
[1:24:10.440 --> 1:24:16.680]  six-year-old well that's the aspect i'm taking forward on this explain it to me like i'm a
[1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:22.120]  six-year-old so that we will all be able to hopefully clearly understand what these people
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:28.360]  are talking about because i think for the most part most of us feel that if it were explained
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:34.040]  to a six-year-old we would be able to grasp it well i want to get more into 911 let's talk about
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:39.080]  you told me that it was great meeting karen johnson out in
[1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:45.000]  phoenix when you were there visiting when you went to the 911 truth event and spoke there
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:49.560]  and i love the video of the media trying to attack you and you throw it right back at them
[1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:54.920]  and say you explain it to me because the official story doesn't answer any of the real questions
[1:24:54.920 --> 1:25:00.680]  and even the 911 commission says they weren't allowed to even do their job so recap what your
[1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:06.600]  experience was like really getting in with both feet in the 911 truth out in arizona
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:12.360]  well i'll tell you there's some dedicated people is the first thing i want to say you know
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:19.480]  senator john karen johnson to me shows tremendous courage because she's a current elected official
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:25.720]  who is making no bones about the fact that she feels that the 911 investigation was completely
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:31.240]  botched and that there certainly should be a second investigation done even though at this
[1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:36.920]  point time it would be exceptionally difficult because there as i stated earlier there's no
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:42.680]  evidence it's all been destroyed so nobody can go there and and get anything scientific
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:49.960]  you know it isn't made available to anybody but uh the people out there are super dedicated
[1:25:49.960 --> 1:25:55.800]  people and they're coming for more walks of life which is the thing that i'm really noticing and
[1:25:55.800 --> 1:26:01.720]  and that really makes me feel good not only do you have a strong group of young people
[1:26:01.720 --> 1:26:07.080]  whom you would expect you know i i grew up in the 60s so you know i know what it's like for
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:12.600]  young people to bolt from the status quo i grew up in the generation that we used to say don't
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:19.800]  trust anyone over 30 you know i remember that famous quote and uh uh you know so you've naturally
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:25.320]  got young people that are heavily involved but then there were also professional people out
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:31.000]  there who are involved people who you wouldn't expect to be involved who have taken time and
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:36.360]  studied it a little bit and i think that's really the thing that needs to happen in this country
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:42.200]  we've got to break away i had a guy the other day just look at me and smile and he's at the golf
[1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:47.400]  club and he said i don't believe any of that conspiracy stuff and i looked at him and i said
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:53.320]  well what knowledge do you actually have what have you done to study it at all are you simply
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:58.440]  going on what the television has told you and what the government has told you and you just
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:04.440]  blindly accept that today and this guy was a vietnam veteran alex i would expect him to be
[1:27:04.440 --> 1:27:10.120]  a little bit more cynical you know in light of the fact they now reveal the Gulf of Confidence
[1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:16.760]  that it never happened and you know in the fraudulent whole vietnam war well the nsa how we
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:22.440]  wouldn't allow we wouldn't allow elections in vietnam because they knew ho Chi Minh would win them
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:29.800]  them you know and things of that nature and so you know and it just it irks me that the public
[1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:36.760]  is so uh they don't want to maybe it's because they don't want to believe anything else but
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:41.400]  that isn't the attitude to have and that's not going to do us any good because you know you
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:45.240]  can stick your hole in the head but it doesn't mean things are going to go away and they're
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:50.840]  going to be right the only way that happens is by people being involved paying attention
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:57.160]  and doing a little detective work on their own and understanding that you cannot trust the mainstream
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:04.520]  media today and you cannot trust our government today absolutely and it's the denial that there
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:08.840]  could be corruption or there could be a problem that has allowed the corruption to take over history
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:14.360]  shows you're always going to have corrupt groups and and criminal organizations and elite trying
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:20.120]  to take over and set up empires and abuse the average person's rights and and liberty and property
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:27.880]  and so to deny that that any of that exists in history or in this country is the greatest
[1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:33.960]  folly and we're about to reap the whirlwind on that front uh governor we're going to break in a
[1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:38.920]  moment and we get back on it Alex let me throw this out for a minute i've done the other thing i
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:46.920]  find so mind-boggling in this whole affair of 9 11 is the fact that we will so quickly believe
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:54.440]  that 19 islamic radicals with box cutters could do what happened that day but we totally throw out
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:29:00.680]  that uh us on the christian side could never do something like that oh that's a great point in
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:04.520]  fact let's keep talking about 9 11 then i want to get into your book and i want to talk about
[1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:10.600]  what's coming up in austin with uh yourself and uh willy nelson and i and a lot more and and maybe

[1:29:32.520 --> 1:29:36.440]  great point in fact let's keep talking about 9 11 then i want to get into your book and i want to
[1:29:36.440 --> 1:29:41.800]  talk about what's coming up in austin with uh yourself and uh willy nelson and i and a lot

[1:32:55.000 --> 1:33:00.120]  what type of questions you have for the good governor we'll talk about his book too before he
[1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:04.600]  leaves us and he is coming to austin i really look forward to that it doesn't get any cooler than
[1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:09.000]  getting to hang out with jessie ventura i'm really excited about it and will he knows at the same
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:13.720]  time and a bunch of others that i'm not at liberty to talk about that are going to be at this event
[1:33:13.720 --> 1:33:17.800]  it just blows me away that this is actually happening but but so jessie doesn't think i'm
[1:33:17.800 --> 1:33:21.480]  kidding him i've got his email like i guess i could send it to him here is the trailer
[1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:26.200]  from the tv show they worked on this similarly but i think his is going to make it through i hope
[1:33:26.200 --> 1:33:34.040]  it does it's about a minute and a half long called american conspiracy here it is these are other
[1:33:34.040 --> 1:33:40.600]  stories you hear in whispered conversations we're both in skull and bone the secret society it's so
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:47.800]  super we can't talk about fun we think it wouldn't take very long for that to happen dealing with
[1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:53.640]  people like this these are the stories that offer different explanations these mothers
[1:33:53.640 --> 1:33:59.160]  and every monster you can imagine and i do this because i believe in this country they are the
[1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:09.400]  stories that must be told suspicion of our politicians is not new but the number of
[1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:15.800]  citizens who distrust the government today has reached an alarming new height in new york city
[1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:22.280]  nearly two-thirds of the population believes there is more to 911 than has been told i believe the
[1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:28.120]  title was been lot and determined to attack inside the united states but where can viewers turn
[1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:37.960]  american conspiracy our nation's preeminent conspiracy expert radio host alex jones
[1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:45.080]  takes us beyond the stock stories of the mainstream media he asks the questions others won't consider
[1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:51.640]  it have you been there for the ceremony with uh the cremation of care uh frankly that i don't
[1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:56.760]  think that's something i need to talk to you about he explores the places others only talk about
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:35:02.440]  you're beginning to sink deeper in the rabbit hole he takes us through the doors others won't
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:17.240]  enter he begins to imagine what we're going to discover in this first ever adrenaline fuel
[1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:23.800]  docudrama alex jones uncovers america's darkest secrets and you need to answer real questions
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:33.560]  that lie it is the x files unscripted all the more frightening because it is real all right it goes
[1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:40.040]  on from there but uh governor ventura what do you think of that you've got me hooked i'm ready to
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:46.040]  watch you know my wife last night i was telling her about this and she just got so excited because i
[1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:50.600]  frankly i think you're going to do 20 times better because you're going to be the producer
[1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:55.240]  and i know you don't want to give us i mean too many hints but but if it gets picked up
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:59.400]  i mean uh what what are some of the areas you're going to get into obviously jfk because
[1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:05.080]  if it isn't that would originally woke you up more than 30 years ago yeah it you know i there's
[1:36:05.080 --> 1:36:11.240]  there's certain aspects to the jfk murder that can still be looked at even today there's certain
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:17.880]  things that could be done which could shed a great deal of light as to what went on you know 40 or
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:23.320]  40 some odd years you know i have the tape of of of e howard hunt saying he ran the operation
[1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:29.080]  i have the video it's there well there's things of that nature then there's other stuff too out
[1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:35.720]  there that i that i that i will get into but jfk uh you know it could it could lead us to to many
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:42.360]  many different things that that uh you know people have questions about and that uh there are
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:48.200]  conspiracies of you know there there's a lot of interesting things that deal around scientology
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:54.280]  and that religion hey how about how about you crash the scientology church or crash skull and bones
[1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:01.880]  oh my god in in order to crash skull and bones i might need a whole field for two
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:09.800]  hey jesse hot listen i on air i'm gonna say it and if it gets off the ground yeah i want to be
[1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:16.920]  a sidekick what wait a minute i want to ask you something skull and bones now that's like this
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:24.680]  secret society at Yale university yeah it's a homoerotic uh germanic death cult where they
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:30.520]  well robert anero got it right in his uh big film uh the good shepherd and they do satanic
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:34.760]  rituals i've actually snuck into one of their meetings that they had separately in california
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:44.120]  the skull and bones that's what they do absolutely well isn't isn't george bush part of that yes it's
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:50.440]  very christian that's what i'm trying to figure out how can that be christian well let me tell
[1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:53.960]  you bohemian grove that i snuck into i'm sure you've heard of that northern california the
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:58.280]  the mainly right wing christian leaders go there and they bust in male prostitutes i mean i'm not
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:01.880]  i know you're not attacking him either for their sexual preference but why are they so
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:09.000]  hypocritical governor well i don't know nothing about that but it's a hypocritical if it's true
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:14.280]  i mean alex sometimes you go to places that even i don't know exist governor do you have a computer
[1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:21.240]  in front of you i love doing the google game google porn star porn star male porn star services
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:29.640]  moguls and you'll be looking at mainstream newspapers remember uh remember jeff gannon the
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:35.640]  ball headed gay madame who was in the white house press conferences and and who was signed in over
[1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:41.560]  a hundred times past midnight at the white house you remember that big thing about any of that
[1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:48.440]  oh listen oh my god i well you got to you know what you better let me just stick to what i know
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:53.560]  about the focus on that get me off track with all this other stuff i won't know whether i'm coming
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:58.520]  or going i know well listen listen you know a lot about stuff i don't know about and and you're in
[1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:03.480]  a very powerful position and kind of like two years ago when i gave you terror storm i would love
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:08.360]  to just be an unofficial advisor and and just i mean i i could send you so much stuff that's
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:15.320]  admitted sir well we were like i said we're gonna do this first pilot and then we go let's let's
[1:39:15.320 --> 1:39:21.480]  get this one on the air and once this one's on the air hopefully we will be brought into series
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:26.920]  and at that point we'll be looking for a lot more stuff to educate and entertain the people on
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:35.400]  well i've publicly groveled to lord ventura lord ventura as i said alex we got to do it
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:40.840]  one step at a time no i know i know i'm right now right now my focus is to do this pilot
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:48.440]  make it as good no entertaining uh to give people knowledge and to make people questions and things
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:54.200]  and give them enough facts to the to the ability to raise some questions and ask them and not be
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:59.320]  afraid to do it well you're the most of you the free country let's always remember that
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:04.760]  we're supposed to have the first amendment here where we can talk and then again and i know this
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:10.760]  has been said many times but people need to always remember the first amendment is to protect
[1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:17.880]  unpopular speech not popular because popular speech doesn't need protection well unpopular
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:23.000]  does you know what mark twain said it mark twain said in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.320]  hated and feared but is in time when his cause succeeds the timon join him because then it
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:31.400]  cost nothing to be a patriot and you really are a great patriot one of the biggest names to go
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:37.000]  public for 911 and it is becoming more and more mainstream thanks to you and and and so many others
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:42.120]  what is it like to see the phenomenon of government sponsored terror becoming more and more accepted
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:48.920]  sir well you know we gotta wait and see you know let's let's see the chips ball and let's see the
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:55.560]  education take place but uh that's you know that's hopefully that's what the show will help to do and
[1:40:55.560 --> 1:41:01.000]  as i said uh you know i'm i'm i'm got my fingers crossed that they are that the courage will be
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:06.440]  there and that it'll get on the air and and uh you know that the two network i think has seen
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:11.800]  somebody told me in 90 million homes today or 100 million homes it's 91 million you know that starts
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:18.360]  the ball rolling and it's one of the biggest uh cable system and shows networks out there
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:23.080]  and i tell you they're lucky to have you i'm just so excited about it i mean jesse ventura
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:28.840]  conspiracy investigations it doesn't get any better than that getting back into 911 there are
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:34.200]  so many facets to it but but some of the areas that they can't ignore is is the white house lying
[1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:37.960]  and saying we never heard of plans to fly planes into buildings when there have been hundreds of
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:42.760]  government drills and plans and uh they'd even you know had operation boat jenka and and other
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:47.480]  cases where things like this had developed uh we also have the war games that morning just
[1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:54.040]  like on sevens yep well yeah it gets me the most galaxies when i watch condolese or rice
[1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:59.880]  testify at state we had no idea they would take planes and use them as missiles in the buildings
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:06.280]  and then you find out that yes they did they they even had as you said practice things that
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:12.600]  to that that had happened within the government and what would they do how can they sit back and
[1:42:12.600 --> 1:42:18.440]  look at us and say they were so naive that they didn't have any idea that this type of
[1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:25.400]  situation could happen you know my intelligence alex i'll tell you what insults my intelligence
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:31.240]  i'm in austin texas the main networks in bernsville minnesota and we have problems about three times
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:35.560]  a year and it's when we have somebody big like jesse ventura in fact the last time it happened
[1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:39.640]  was when he was on and you probably can't hear it governor but somebody's cutting into the line
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:44.280]  john i want to switch to the other is the end right now okay i don't know if you're hearing
[1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:49.480]  that crackling but okay it's switched yeah governor a lot of weird stuff going on here on our end
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:54.360]  but i'm sure it's just a coincidence that somebody cuts our our digital lines only when you're on the
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:43:01.960]  show well maybe it's coming from my end too because you know i wrote about that in my book you know
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:06.920]  the house that i lived in at the time i was governor it turned out that there's a pretty big
[1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:15.240]  strong evidence that my lines were kept there now governor after all alex let's remember
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:20.840]  our democrats gave the president the ability to do that again well well did you hear it when i was
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:25.720]  in you you probably didn't it was in the Denver post when i was in Denver for the dnc i was going
[1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:29.880]  to meet uh... with Cindy she had and she was doing a big event with Ralph nader and i was
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:34.520]  invited to that and i'm going to meet her when i meet with her she goes guess what i just caught
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:38.760]  she goes in her room she's already been checked in she goes out on each she goes in the doors
[1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:44.200]  cracked there's a guy in a suit over her phone putting a device in it he screws the top on
[1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:49.720]  and runs out of the room pastor i mean and then of course you talked about what happened at your
[1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:56.440]  house tell folks about that again well you know we are formed we had a system set up where as the
[1:43:56.440 --> 1:44:01.560]  governor in your private home they give you this red phone but even if it's knocked off the hook
[1:44:01.560 --> 1:44:07.480]  it will ring automatically the local police you know who will come running which is a good idea
[1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:11.400]  you know you don't even have to speak into it if the if the phone is knocked off the hook
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:15.800]  that that sends a message right to the local police and they're they're coming
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:23.560]  and not but when they install that uh... we always had weird clicking on my regular phones and it
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:28.440]  was so bad it became laughable where my in-laws would automatically state well i guess that
[1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:33.960]  if you're out there we're talking again you know in that type of thing and then when i ended being
[1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:39.960]  governor uh... we found a little transformer type thing out on my deck one day that a friend of mine
[1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:45.240]  said who used to do that for the phone company went ordered to said that that had something to do
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:51.880]  with uh... you know a listening type device and then uh... uh... the guys who came out to then
[1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:58.280]  rewire my phones back up after the red phone was taken out and all this other stuff they came up
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:03.480]  just baffled they said we've never seen phone wiring like this in all the years we've worked on them
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:07.080]  so that's all i can go on alex is that it was a very
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:11.160]  strange situation to say the least by four years in office
[1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:15.880]  well you know you you've told this story we never got into much detail here can you
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:22.040]  briefly get back into one of your first days at work you go to the capital there's 23 cia people
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:28.680]  in your office but they won't tell you who they are they won't tell no no no that's that no they
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:34.200]  weren't in my office they were in the capital basement work and yeah they they and and let's
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:40.600]  put it in the right thing they requested quote requested that i come down and interview with them
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:45.880]  you know i don't want to say they ordered me to because there was no one that said i had to
[1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:53.080]  do but i being former military and you know new to the job i felt that i guess this is my obligation
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:58.200]  if the cia wants to talk to me and i'm the governor in the state of minnesota i certainly should
[1:45:58.200 --> 1:46:04.280]  talk to them so i went out and then that when it arrived i went down into the bowels of the
[1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:10.200]  capital into uh this closed room and i sat in a chair and they were in a big half moon circle
[1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:18.040]  around me and let me also say they were very professional they were very courteous they always
[1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:24.680]  addressed me as my title governor you know all the formalities were there i guess the scariest
[1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:32.040]  thing about it alex was this as i looked around the room at these 23 people i saw my neighbors
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:39.800]  and what i mean by that is you would never guess in your wildest dreams that these were cia
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:47.160]  operatives which is their job so obviously they recruit and they do it very well because
[1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:51.320]  some of the people i looked at would look like the old retired guy down the street that would
[1:46:51.320 --> 1:46:58.680]  sweep the step others were younger people others were professionals others were blue collar they
[1:46:58.680 --> 1:47:06.040]  they came from with an entire cross section of what you call america amazing and uh so
[1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:12.840]  so and and then of course i was a little belligerent being who i am and i i said before i asked
[1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:18.600]  answer any of your questions i have a few for you and i one of them was i asked them why
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:24.120]  they were operational within the united states when uh when their orders are in their that
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:31.080]  they're not to be operated there's a federal law it's a felony right and well clearly that's
[1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:37.160]  that law isn't enforced because they're entrenched in minnesota government and as i talk about in
[1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:42.760]  my book and what did they say to you well they they wouldn't really they avoided the question
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:47.240]  pretty much and and you know i said your mission statement says you're not to be operational in
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:53.080]  the u.s what are you doing here you know and then i said i want to go around the room and i'd like
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:59.080]  for you to tell me your name and what you do well i got about half and half on both half would tell
[1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:04.200]  me their names i don't know if they were their real names or not the way of verifying that
[1:48:04.200 --> 1:48:09.480]  and half would say at all what they did if they did tell me what they did how would you know that
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:14.760]  was the truth so how did it end they could tell it it was much like when i went through sears school
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:21.160]  survival escape resistance and evasion when i was a frog man well when they interrogate you there
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:27.080]  my actual rate was storekeeper which is supply so i would tell them i'm a storekeeper i work in
[1:48:27.080 --> 1:48:33.560]  supply i hand out blankets and requisition parts although i was actually a navy seal
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:39.400]  never worked in supply at all but in those days you had to go up in rank with a regular navy rate
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:45.720]  and so i was a storekeeper and uh and maybe that's the way it was it is for these people too
[1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:50.440]  that they don't you know they can make up and not actually do what they tell but didn't you
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:55.800]  say the meeting basically ended there because they wouldn't uh answer the questions oh no no it's not
[1:48:55.800 --> 1:49:01.400]  not at all it didn't end there it took their questions and amazingly all their questions
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:06.280]  dealt around how i got elected they wanted to understand how you came out of left field
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:12.680]  yep and that's their job and it's like when i went home that day and i called my friend
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:18.040]  bick marsinko you know the creator of seal team six and a 30-year navy seal and
[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:23.960]  dick dealt with the cia a whole lot more than i ever did and uh and i you know i was only in
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:29.560]  an active duty four years dick was in there 30 something and uh so i called dick to ask him
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:34.680]  about it he started laughing and he said well i don't know exactly but i can throw a guess out
[1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:39.560]  and i said well your guess is going to be better than mine fire it he said they didn't see you
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:45.320]  coming and he said their job is to report trends they want to find out other it's going to be six
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:50.200]  more of these independent governors that might win what's going on in the country because that's

[1:54:09.640 --> 1:54:14.280]  waking up and to know that we are on the real cutting edge and then i get to associate with
[1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:18.600]  people like willy nelson and jesse ventura and the former german defense minister andres von
[1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:22.440]  bulow and the italian president former italian president's gone public saying it's an inside
[1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:29.560]  job people like bill christiansen cia section chief in berlin who says it's an inside job bob
[1:54:30.120 --> 1:54:36.120]  bear who says it's a inside job on this show the guy that made siriana about cia black hop commander

[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:17.480]  info wars dot com and what's willy nelson's idea the thing is so popular that even when willy said
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:21.640]  come to the event it was almost sold out then so it's sold out you might go to scalpers to get in

[2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:28.040]  navy i served in a navy my uncle served in a navy my other uncle served in the marine
[2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:33.160]  too and his brother's jack rabbit served in it what's your point yeah um the point is that uh

[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:43.640]  broader view of uh just our conspiracy theory so we're gonna actually go through these things
[2:01:44.200 --> 2:01:50.840]  one by one and i hope it does take off on the ground um the other thing is that i'm glad other
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:55.640]  people are waking up but you know for i've been doing this since 1979 just telling people you
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:02:01.640]  know getting the looks getting the stairs you know since i was in the navy so it's a hard road
[2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:06.280]  battle that we have to keep going you know and just not give up it is robert i hear you yeah
[2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:10.840]  what about going the distance governor i mean you know the truth will out if the uh good men
[2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:17.000]  stand up on it well you'd like to believe that alex you know we live our lives believing those
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:23.800]  things but uh i guess i i'm a realist too i've already come to the realization that in my lifetime
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:29.720]  the minnesota vikings will never win the super bowl hey are you going to uh i'm sorry go ahead
[2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:35.400]  no and i and i say that in the fact that you're fighting a very very difficult battle here when
[2:02:35.400 --> 2:02:40.120]  you're fighting people that want to censor things and won't allow the truth to come out
[2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:45.400]  and when they have the power to where they can take things put them away for long periods of
[2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:51.640]  time like the latest thing i heard is that all of rudy juliani's papers now are locked up for
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:57.320]  25 years yes what is the story with that they're they're hiding everything i mean it's just
[2:02:57.320 --> 2:03:04.520]  incredible the point is he was in public service everything he did as a mayor should be public
[2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:10.600]  knowledge i released every document of my four years in government are now in the minnesota

[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:24.520]  we got some other huge guests in the fight against the new world order next week
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:32.120]  i gotta dig around here in my uh stack i had all this stuff put it up on my next guest
[2:10:33.400 --> 2:10:38.520]  last night and so much is piled up here i was digging around during the first
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:43.880]  of the venturi interview looking for it and now i can't find it i just can't do it all
[2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:47.880]  i'm trying to do stuff during the breaks and it's just turned into a total insane asylum here
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:11:00.840]  here at the office but i'm exhausted after that interview i've got another one coming up
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:05.880]  but a lot of behind the scenes stuff that i know that i can't tell anybody about
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:11.240]  you got the depression coming on and all these neat things happening for those of us in the
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:15.560]  fight against the new world order we're gaining so much ground right now but also the enemy
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:19.960]  uh is just expanding that's why we're gaining ground because people are finally figuring out
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:23.960]  the reality of what we've been talking about for so long
[2:11:26.760 --> 2:11:30.120]  yeah i haven't mugging venturi with a lot of my videos and materials and stuff he's already
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:33.480]  got a lot of them but i need to just i need to give him a crash course and all this stuff
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:39.560]  because he's a great guy but uh like with the bailout and a few things he wasn't
[2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:44.760]  you know he didn't trust him he wasn't for it but he wasn't up to speed on a lot of it and uh
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:49.160]  but what do you expect he's a busy guy what do you expect for the general public
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:55.400]  let's uh take some phone calls then i'm gonna regroup here and uh get into some of the other news
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:12:02.680]  that i have here in front of me oh mar and canada sorry you didn't get on with ventura go ahead
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:10.600]  yeah how you doing alex yes uh you've been um talking about neo feudalism and i really
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:16.040]  starting to see the parallels now with with what you're saying you were had a guest on there before
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:22.120]  talking about how these government agencies basically have put a letter of mark on us you
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:26.040]  know and think about like a cop or the ministry of transport every time you go down the road
[2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:31.240]  they're standing at the side looking for a handout and i don't see any difference you know it really
[2:12:31.240 --> 2:12:38.520]  does look like we're going back into you know imperial british rule to me you know things like
[2:12:39.400 --> 2:12:46.840]  these um marine um recruiting centers they're nothing more than uh press gangs oh i meant to
[2:12:46.840 --> 2:12:55.960]  ask ventura about uh the army announcing they're going to use north com in regular operations
[2:12:55.960 --> 2:13:00.680]  against the american people there were so many questions that i had had mentally thought about
[2:13:00.680 --> 2:13:09.320]  but uh forgotten to get to with ventura uh on air drat drat double drat but i can have him in studio
[2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:15.320]  the sunday he's here because the willy nelson doesn't go on stage to like 10 30 at night we're
[2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:21.320]  giving our speeches at like between 9 and 10 and uh at the event and he's here all day he comes in
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:27.400]  the day before that um and i'm going to be taking him around town and he's staying basically with
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:32.200]  us but uh i need to get him on air and asking questions like that because and he's got a
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:36.120]  military background a lot of people listen to ventura that won't listen to me just because
[2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:41.080]  they know ventura and don't know myself but um no i'm i'm glad you bring that point up
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:44.840]  well someone had asked him at one of his book signings when he was picking on the idea of
[2:13:44.840 --> 2:13:48.760]  running for office would he abolish the federal reserve and he said that'll get you a bullet in
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:54.120]  the head i think you know i understand because i'm not the one with the cia target on my forehead
[2:13:54.120 --> 2:14:00.520]  yeah ventura ventura it knows a lot more than he lets on yeah yeah that's pretty disturbing
[2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:05.400]  they just surround him in his office and i mean they're just secret police that's all they are
[2:14:05.400 --> 2:14:09.800]  i mean i people try to idolize it well what what they do is they wouldn't do it with ventura but
[2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:13.880]  with others other governors and mayors they bring them satchels full of hundred dollar bills and i
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:18.440]  interviewed the san tonia police chief they tried to buy off other officials they tried to buy off
[2:14:18.440 --> 2:14:23.480]  there's a huge covert black op government all around us and that's evidenced by the
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:28.040]  former mayor of minnesota who kept quiet about it for many years and just now wrote about it
[2:14:28.040 --> 2:14:33.560]  uh i just wanted to ask you do you have any information on the history of the symbol of the
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:42.120]  dollar oh what the all-seeing eye no the dollar bill well i mean it has all-seeing eye on it
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:50.280]  well the you know the it's an ass with the bars um just someone had told me years ago this was
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:56.920]  his take on it and i thought it would it it really hit hit the mark the s stands for slavery or
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:15:03.400]  serfdom and the two bars are the single bars the bars of imprisonment do you do a google search
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:07.640]  you'll find that there's no it's the the history of it's quite mysterious they know where the
[2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:15.560]  the um hello yes you're on air oh they know where the the history of the the pound and the lira
[2:15:15.560 --> 2:15:20.840]  but the the dollar bill symbol just suddenly appear at the beginning of the republic and nobody
[2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:25.560]  really knows what the origins of it are although they make some assertions it's associated with the
[2:15:26.120 --> 2:15:31.240]  spanish uh some spanish uh the you know gold the bullion or something like that which really
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:36.200]  doesn't make sense but i just thought what you wonder maybe some monetary historian can call
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:41.560]  in and let us know thanks for calling oh mar yes very interesting christian in california

[2:16:19.560 --> 2:16:26.280]  like afghan afghan society title or like the uh the freemasons and stuff what societies
[2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:31.400]  oh i can't eat it yes ancient age you don't want to let you go because that bluetooth
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:39.160]  didn't work in too well it's very hard to understand you um i can get pieces of it yes there are
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:48.280]  several branches of history but you had esoteric ancient mystery religions based in the tigress
[2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:56.120]  euphrates and babalon based in the nile delta uh in egypt and based in greece and they basically
[2:16:56.120 --> 2:17:02.120]  all worship the planets and they had similar names for the planets and that you know they had a god
[2:17:02.120 --> 2:17:06.840]  of the harvest and a god of the sun and the god of the winner and a god of the crocodile and a
[2:17:06.840 --> 2:17:12.520]  you know god of this and god of that and they worshiped the reproductive cycle and the male
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:18.920]  and female reproductive organs a dome or capital is worshiping a heaping stomach of a woman
[2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:28.840]  with a chest dating baby uh the obelisk or towers are the male phallus or the male sexual organ
[2:17:28.840 --> 2:17:37.960]  member and uh then that got passed on and then you had the dark ages that came after the fall of
[2:17:37.960 --> 2:17:43.000]  roam and 410 and before that the sacking and burning of alexandria and the library there
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:52.760]  and so one of the only groups that actually kept all of that written down and documented
[2:17:53.560 --> 2:18:01.240]  and had private libraries kept by the levitical guild or the levitical priest of the family of
[2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:09.960]  the tribe of levi a subgroup of the hebrus or what is known as the jews today they kept all
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:16.120]  that all those ideas and uh the torah is the old testament uh but then you have the talmud
[2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:22.840]  and uh several other books that came after that that are kind of like the the the the the orthodox
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:29.720]  jews new testaments separate from the gentile new testament and in those you just see codified
[2:18:30.600 --> 2:18:37.080]  the history of babalon greece egypt and those ideas systems of governing systems of mathematics
[2:18:37.080 --> 2:18:43.560]  things that were very very valuable propaganda tricks that had been learned and so that's why
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:52.440]  our entire culture is i'd say more than 80 of it orbits around Judaism i mean i mean that's
[2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:58.280]  where christianity comes from that's where the masonic halls come from that's where all all
[2:18:58.280 --> 2:19:05.400]  these basic systems come from because only the jews had the most complete records of governing
[2:19:05.400 --> 2:19:11.560]  systems and systems of control and all the other esoteric religious stuff that that that before
[2:19:11.560 --> 2:19:17.880]  they had their own monotheistic system but then later in their history they adopted um
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:27.720]  at least into their oral traditions and written traditions the the the entirety of of of of pre
[2:19:27.720 --> 2:19:34.200]  christian history and so that's why the mason's biggest secrets you know are the what happened
[2:19:34.200 --> 2:19:39.720]  in Solomon's temple and the mathematic equations and all those secrets was because all of that
[2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:48.280]  was carried through and and and so people wrongly say that all of your masonic systems are are jewish
[2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:54.440]  mysticism well no they're not it even if you want to talk about where it came from it came from
[2:19:54.440 --> 2:20:08.200]  egypt babelon tire and grace will be right back the stock market is crazy the chem trails are

[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:52.520]  i know i know my friend i know my little sweetie pie
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:57.080]  monday night and i listened to you talking about obama and what they want to do here in
[2:34:57.080 --> 2:35:02.920]  missouri being i am from missouri uh i tried to tell my sister-in-law about that last night
[2:35:02.920 --> 2:35:06.440]  how they're wanting to stifle freedom here in missouri and anybody makes any kind of
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:14.120]  derogatory comments and writing or on the news media about obama she absolutely went completely
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:20.440]  ballistic alex she said now where did you get that from and i said well i heard it on the radio
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:28.200]  and this alex jones even had uh comments in the kansas city news and she just completely
[2:35:28.200 --> 2:35:35.640]  went so we blessed the god me and said all that is nothing but bar room talk well it was on a
[2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:40.680]  bunch of tv stations there they had the sheriffs and prosecutors on there saying that if you talk
[2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:45.640]  about about obama and they decide that it's a lie they're going to come arrest you and now they backed
[2:35:45.640 --> 2:35:51.560]  off and apologized in the newspapers yesterday so i didn't even cover it but uh i mean i i i guess
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:58.120]  she thinks that the bankers aren't trying to cheat us either i mean i guess obama's well alex let me
[2:35:58.120 --> 2:36:03.240]  tell you something my friend these people are like you're always saying they're living in complete
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:08.120]  denial they're dumbed down from years of watching the news media and all they think about watching
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:15.000]  on tv is comedy comedy central or jimmy kimball poking fun of all this as far as i'm concerned
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:19.720]  these comedians they're no better than our federal governor wall street well that's what i was about
[2:36:19.720 --> 2:36:25.960]  to say i've been watching more tv lately more news and they have the men and the women just
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:32.040]  smiling with these fake smiles and oh and and and and and and and just fluffing everything
[2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:37.400]  and and then the comedians you think are actually criticizing the politicians but they're making
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:41.560]  it a joke and it's not a joke i mean that's why i could have played the clubs of sarah
[2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:47.240]  palin so sorry it is not sounding ten times stupider than miss south carolina but we never
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:53.400]  did it because it makes for good radio but it's not a laughing matter joke alex and you were talking
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:57.880]  to one of your callers there money now i can't pick you up very good during the daytime anymore
[2:36:57.880 --> 2:37:04.360]  but one of your uh callers is advocating uh cutting the tv cables and you're my friend you
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:09.800]  done wise by telling people not to get involved with violence the time of violence alex as far as
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:15.800]  i'm concerned is already here the people in columbia missouri crime is just it's just completely
[2:37:15.800 --> 2:37:21.720]  skyrocketing out of control albert alex and the people calling albert i've always liked that name
[2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:25.320]  they don't they don't realize that the gcm radio network
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:32.760]  i'm sorry go ahead they people don't realize what's going on alex the crime is absolutely
[2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:37.160]  sparring out of control in columbia missouri and people haven't seen anything yet we go into a
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:43.400]  depression look we we had a well-behaved orderly christian nation on average back in the 1920s
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:48.840]  and the 30s today if we have a real depression which which it looks like is a foregone conclusion
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:52.680]  it is good you're not going to worry about the new order and the police the demonic public
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:57.960]  the the yuppies particularly are going to be just look out katie bar the door

[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:08.920]  into nothing but uh country clubs are they're absolutely well it's on record that the feds
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:14.520]  secretly pay 26 000 preachers to give anti-american speeches and tell people to turn their guns in
[2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:19.560]  yes we all know all about that alex it's all part of the freedom yes it is sir
[2:38:20.760 --> 2:38:27.000]  well they just absolutely the american people are just absolutely been dumbed down by all this alex
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:32.200]  well farmer stan a lot of people are waking up though we gotta have to say there's something
[2:38:32.200 --> 2:38:36.840]  you know there's a there there's there's several out there's a rainbow there's a silver lining to
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:43.640]  the nerve gas cloud yes well you know but the sad thing about it you were talking you were talking
[2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:49.320]  to one of your uh guest on there the guy that was talking to jean chaplain is that his name
[2:38:49.320 --> 2:38:54.360]  bob chaplain bob chaplain albert chaplain he is very smart individual but i'll tell you what now
[2:38:54.360 --> 2:38:59.560]  if it ever comes down to what he's that you know he's talking about grilla warfare and all this
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:05.400]  i live right down not too far from whiteman air force base uh whiteman has a stealth bomber
[2:39:05.400 --> 2:39:10.600]  they have a b-52 they can absolutely wipe out these cities in a heartbeat alex i've talked to
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:15.960]  people in special forces are in Panama but told me what went on when they went in to get noriega
[2:39:15.960 --> 2:39:23.320]  puff the magic dragon yes live by the sea and frolic in them out of mist yes with a huge
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:29.560]  vulcan gatling gun the land called holly yes good to hear from you stan i appreciate it
[2:39:30.760 --> 2:39:35.960]  the truth is the new world war is very easy to militarily push over that's only one part of the
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:41.640]  equation the troops mainly though they're hiring illegal aliens and felons are on our side a lot
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:45.720]  of the police and major polls and we've covered those yesterday with colonel roberts on air are
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:50.920]  actually on our side they had a poll like a year ago major national were 99 percent of police so
[2:39:50.920 --> 2:39:57.080]  they were pro-second amendment and wouldn't confiscate guns so by and large the more as i get a
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:03.080]  little bit more wise it's the corrupt system by and large the police aren't even the big problem
[2:40:03.080 --> 2:40:06.680]  though they there were the rubber meets the road they do a lot of really bad things under orders
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:14.600]  and some of them are a bunch of roy dead nuts but um they're not a lot of march stupid or they were
[2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:19.640]  stupid they get street smart work on the streets and they know a scam when they see one the problem
[2:40:19.640 --> 2:40:24.280]  is uh the military predominantly will not fight back against the american people if things break
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:29.640]  down you know they may try to maintain order but if things turn into a shooting war or arrest people
[2:40:29.640 --> 2:40:34.760]  put them in FEMA camps that's going to break down pretty fast they try to use new orleans for a few
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:39.800]  years as a laboratory of that the problem is things will break down and people will be starving to
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:48.040]  death and they will beg to turn their guns in for food speaking of that i've got a few sponsors

[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:38.760]  albert louise possum anyways go ahead uh you're talking to albert downs i think that's tmi um i
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:43.000]  hope i had time for two points if you could hold me over the break we had a commercial i'd appreciate
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:49.480]  it but the first one i want to talk about is uh hegellian dialectic i think that's the operative
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:54.760]  term with respect to this bailout and uh for folks that that i've heard that term i've heard you
[2:45:54.760 --> 2:46:00.280]  talk about it before alex yeah i was trying to get a good definition and basically what alex my name
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:07.080]  is albert okay albert i'm gonna stop screwing around go ahead all right so elegant hegellian
[2:46:07.080 --> 2:46:13.640]  dialectic basically what it is they guide us into a crisis or conflict that lead us to some
[2:46:13.640 --> 2:46:19.000]  sort of predetermined solution so so what i'm seeing with respect to this bailout is i'm
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:24.920]  listening to media i'm talking about alternative media patrick patriotic media mainstream media
[2:46:24.920 --> 2:46:30.360]  i'm starting to hear noise about replacing the system the system is dead we got to replace it
[2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:35.000]  and their answer is a global government run by the bankers the very people that engineered it
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:39.960]  well i'm not hearing the i mean i'm i always listen to media carefully and i'm not hearing
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:44.840]  you mean the mainstream tv or the financial publications i across the board i'm just starting
[2:46:44.840 --> 2:46:49.880]  to hear so you haven't heard them call for a global government run by the bankers oh i'm sorry i i
[2:46:49.880 --> 2:46:54.120]  did see some stuff in one of the british papers a couple days ago some old street journal you
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:59.320]  name it kessinger's pushing it well yeah i mean he's been pushing it forever that's not the new
[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:05.640]  but what's what's new is this is this pushing us into the system's dead we got to replace it
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:11.480]  and and so they want to bring in a new monetized amaro with the regional currencies and you'll
[2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:17.480]  have a national ID card to track your carbon credits which they're now announcing so if i could
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:22.200]  read i just have a little quote out of a book i've also heard you uh mentioned many times
[2:47:22.200 --> 2:47:27.400]  by the club of rome called the first global revolution ah if you people haven't read chapter
[2:47:27.400 --> 2:47:31.320]  five i think chapter five is only about 12 pages that's all you gotta read i mean it really tells
[2:47:31.320 --> 2:47:35.560]  you everything there you might have to read it 20 times but that tells you everything you need to
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:42.840]  know here's a very short quote if i can read it sacrilegious though this may sound democracy
[2:47:42.840 --> 2:47:48.600]  is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead democracy is no longer well suited for the tasks
[2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:54.840]  for the head the complexity and the technical nature of many of today's problems do not always
[2:47:54.840 --> 2:47:59.960]  allow elected representatives to make competent decisions at the right time what are we seeing
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:05.160]  right now they're telling us our congress and the people are too stupid to make decisions about
[2:48:05.160 --> 2:48:11.000]  their financial future and they know the public thinks in 24 hour news cycles and so the public
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:16.680]  some of them i'm glad to say the majority aren't being fooled now think that congress caused the
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:22.040]  stock market to plunge 700 points and now believe this is all a new problem and then they have the
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:26.440]  other lie that it was all caused by subprime mortgages which then again blames the public
[2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:34.120]  so democracy is is inefficient and can no longer is no longer richard in haas in the same club of
[2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:39.160]  room documents says we'll use fake environmentalism to take their rights and stage terror i mean these
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:43.320]  guys are i mean you could take a quote from david rockefeller about how we you know don't want
[2:48:44.040 --> 2:48:48.920]  people running their own countries we want bankers running it yep they uh you know they
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:53.160]  tell you right there in that book that they're going to engineer food shortages water shortages
[2:48:53.160 --> 2:48:57.800]  and then global warming and then we talk about it and who set up the meeting in 1989 in washington
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:03.560]  dc al gore for them and then the pr population thinks that thinks that the big texas oilman
[2:49:04.200 --> 2:49:11.080]  uh boon pickens is is putting up air powered deals in in in the panhandle of texas and into
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:17.400]  other states but really it's all about grabbing the water supply and that's all admitted i didn't
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:21.880]  know that oh yeah you know that's a stealth deal to grab the biggest aquifer in the us
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  but it's so it's good do i have another minute to quote something from another book yes sir
[2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:34.680]  okay so for those people out there and i know a lot of people you mentioned i i i try and get
[2:49:34.680 --> 2:49:38.840]  through this material that everybody brings up at least try and scan it and we got carol quick
[2:49:38.840 --> 2:49:44.440]  leaves tragedy to help the big thousand page plus monster that who can get i can't get through it
[2:49:44.440 --> 2:49:51.320]  well what i found was cleon scousen wrote a nice little hundred and fifty page summary of that book
[2:49:51.960 --> 2:49:57.640]  called the naked capitalist yep really summarizes what quickly was saying in his book explaining
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:50:04.680]  that the bankers created communism and fascism as consolidation combines it really goes through
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:08.600]  all the mean points that quickly was trying to make so for people if you can find it i took me
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:13.720]  quite a while to find the naked capitalist i got i got we have his nephew on sometime right i think
[2:50:13.720 --> 2:50:19.160]  he i think his nephew joel actually helped out the call campaign um but this quote's a little
[2:50:19.160 --> 2:50:25.400]  bit longer if i could before you go ahead and read it okay um everything the super super rich
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:31.320]  collective collectivist do must be accomplished in an atmosphere of propaganda and deception boy do

[2:54:17.560 --> 2:54:22.200]  that want to go uh search for it and find it on the web but let me just start again i wrote the i
[2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:26.600]  read the first sentence previously everything is super rich collectivists do must be accomplished
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:31.800]  in an atmosphere of propaganda and deception otherwise they keep running into a ground swell
[2:54:31.800 --> 2:54:36.680]  of resentment and resistance as they try to compel middle class americans to give up their
[2:54:36.680 --> 2:54:42.680]  independence their property and their constitutional progress let me repeat that give up their
[2:54:42.680 --> 2:54:48.840]  independence their property and their constitutional progress and what is the current strategy of the
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:55.400]  establishment it is too prompt first pressure from the top second pressure from the bottom
[2:54:55.400 --> 2:55:03.400]  the current tactic is to create revolution create revolution violence and extremely
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:09.400]  serious dislocation at the bottom let me just read that they want to create revolution violence
[2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:14.360]  and extremely serious social dislocation at the bottom while simultaneously creating an ever
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:19.480]  increasing pressure at the top for monolithic powers by demanding that the executive branch of
[2:55:19.480 --> 2:55:27.080]  the federal government be given massive power to quote unquote solve all these problems i mean
[2:55:27.080 --> 2:55:32.120]  we're watching this happen as as we speak i mean we're we're watching it right now it is bailout
[2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:36.120]  but your executive branch is trying to this is about a power grab whether it is about money
[2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:41.160]  because they they're already spending the money um so so what we're seeing here you read these
[2:55:41.160 --> 2:55:50.600]  quotes you we're we're seeing this being acted as uh as we go through this no i hear you and
[2:55:50.600 --> 2:55:56.360]  you're absolutely right and that's the historical fact and that's what we try to get people to
[2:55:56.360 --> 2:56:03.080]  think about here and i appreciate your call scott bernard steve mark mike kevin and others
[2:56:03.080 --> 2:56:08.360]  our next guest is only to be with us for 20 minutes that's why on info wars dot com on the
[2:56:08.360 --> 2:56:12.600]  audio screens and for president planet dot tv viewers want to go back live like we did with
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:18.200]  jessie ventura earlier uh we are going to skip the five after break for everybody else will be
[2:56:18.200 --> 2:56:21.880]  back after that so we'll have a five minute segment when our guests are scheduled to be calling in
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:27.720]  in the next five six minutes and then we'll come in with them and skip that segment uh that break
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:35.160]  and uh so we have a full 20-something minutes with our guests today so i'm excited about that
[2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:41.160]  because uh more and more we see people really breaking the left-right paradigm and getting
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:46.520]  the big picture about what's happened in our society we're also going to continue with phone
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:50.840]  calls the last 40 minutes of the show and get into the latest economic developments what's
[2:56:50.840 --> 2:56:57.320]  happening with stock market what's happening with commodities oil gold silver uh today as well
[2:56:58.680 --> 2:57:04.120]  and uh the senate is set at seven o'clock eastern tonight to vote on the quote bailout package now
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:08.760]  again as the caller said the money isn't even the big issue that 700 billion alone bloomberg
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:13.480]  and others report it's more like five trillion that is a big issue it's all very important
[2:57:13.480 --> 2:57:20.360]  but compared to the fact that they want to get immunity and compared to the fact that
[2:57:20.920 --> 2:57:27.320]  they want to give you more power to the treasury um and and the fact that they have the mainstream
[2:57:27.320 --> 2:57:33.080]  media trying to bully the american people into going along with this this is not going to save
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:41.800]  the the economic system and so we do live in very very very interesting times right now
[2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:48.600]  and we've you know people that understand that this is not quote capitalism this is crony
[2:57:48.600 --> 2:57:53.560]  capitalism this is corruption and the media now latimer putin came out bad mouthing the us today
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:57:58.680]  and a lot of people are saying capitalism has caused all this this is not capitalism when you
[2:57:58.680 --> 2:58:07.320]  have corruption and you have people in derivatives uh running all sorts of economic scams this is
[2:58:07.320 --> 2:58:16.760]  corruption and we're talking about over a thousand trillion dollars in derivatives and that certainly
[2:58:16.760 --> 2:58:21.160]  is not to follow people with subprime mortgages they certainly are guilty of lying on the applications
[2:58:21.160 --> 2:58:28.280]  but but this is a system-wide problem ladies and gentlemen we do have our huge guests and uh
[2:58:28.280 --> 2:58:35.720]  we'll be back to start the fourth hour in one minute and our guest ladies and gentlemen is

[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:53.800]  lately i i wanted to get your take first on the bailout that's going on right now you know i i don't
[3:00:53.800 --> 3:00:59.320]  know if it's going to relieve the pressure on our our citizens and americans i'm all for it
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:04.120]  you know it's so complicated alex you know and unless you really delve into that to find out
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:10.840]  exactly what it's going to do it's a very difficult situation to uh determine and i just hope if they
[3:01:10.840 --> 3:01:16.920]  do pass the bill that it's not in vain you know that uh we're not going to waste another trillion
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:23.000]  dollars for unnecessarily it's just a so you know it's i'll tell you that's why i wrote this book i
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:29.560]  i've uh you know i really did a lot of research because i am so worried like so many people in
[3:01:29.560 --> 3:01:35.160]  america are about the future about the direction our country's heading economically and our national
[3:01:35.160 --> 3:01:40.600]  debt and illegal immigration and all these issues we're facing and you know and and research and
[3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:45.320]  doing all the research on this book here you know but you know and finding out that the founding
[3:01:45.320 --> 3:01:51.720]  fathers had a vision for america and it was not corrupted by greed and power and i'm and uh you
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:56.520]  know and the politicians are so disconnected from the will of the people you know and uh
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:01.800]  you know we uh we've got to do something about it alex you know it's that's why in this book here
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:07.880]  i just give uh eight major problems america's facing and and i give my own common sense solutions
[3:02:07.880 --> 3:02:13.160]  to solving this problem you know the first chapter deals with the i believe we've forgotten our roots
[3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:18.040]  and have drifted from the principles and belief that our country's founded upon you know and then
[3:02:18.040 --> 3:02:22.120]  the second chapter is about our national debt you know and and then the third one's about our
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:26.760]  nation's borders and the illegal immigration and going all the way down to them i think we lost
[3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:32.680]  our moral compass in america the evaluation of human life telling them our children and i actually
[3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:38.760]  i talk about our our health problems also you know i think uh we have a huge serious health
[3:02:38.760 --> 3:02:43.480]  problem here in america and now you talk about the trans fats and other chemicals in the food i
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:47.240]  mean even if you try to be healthy and eat that stuff you you're going to get sick because it's
[3:02:47.240 --> 3:02:52.680]  deadly yeah it is it is uh but the thing is you just got to be more cautious of what it is that
[3:02:52.680 --> 3:02:57.800]  and knowing the right times to eat and uh and the amounts that you eat you know we're the most
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:03:02.360]  over eaten country in the world you know because i've been over europe you know people are very
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:08.280]  cautious about how they do eat yeah giant portions i mean they have big gulp drinks at seven eleven
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:13.800]  the size of small trash cans now i know i know you know and this thing we need to put the pressure
[3:03:13.800 --> 3:03:18.760]  on our fast food chains to you know start improving on the quality of the foods you know making don't
[3:03:18.760 --> 3:03:24.280]  make them so fat related you know and but did you like the movie of the film fast food nation i
[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:32.840]  thought it was pretty good yeah yeah but you know the thing is alex we we have such a bloated
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:38.520]  federal bureaucracy you know in government you know i'll give you an example how many how many
[3:03:38.520 --> 3:03:44.840]  pages do you think there are in the irs tax code i know it's in the tens of thousands and they have
[3:03:44.840 --> 3:03:50.920]  all these yeah the exactly sixty six thousand four hundred ninety eight pages alex you know
[3:03:50.920 --> 3:03:56.680]  and the thing is who in the world knows what's in those sixty six thousand pages charlie you know uh
[3:03:57.480 --> 3:04:02.440]  uh wrangle he doesn't know and he writes the tax code that's what george arwell said that that
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:08.360]  in a tyranny the government writes laws that makes everybody criminal yeah exactly you know
[3:04:08.360 --> 3:04:13.800]  and a good example of that is in 2005 when researching this book i found out in 2005 over
[3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:19.480]  six thousand tax payers making over two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year paid absolutely
[3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:24.680]  no taxes you know so we have a broken system here in the country in fact uh you know it's
[3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:31.160]  unconstitutional until 1913 for two even tax our people and then we had the you know in 1913
[3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:36.680]  we had the 16th amendment that made irs legal well chuck i know i know you're very well educated
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:41.000]  because i know a lot of the dallas police and state police and and and and and folks that know
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:44.520]  you years ago you know before i ever actually confirmed it you know said that you were aware
[3:04:44.520 --> 3:04:48.680]  of some of the work that i do and ron paul and others and i mean that's it we have private bankers
[3:04:48.680 --> 3:04:53.480]  the new world order that control both parties what's your take on all this globalization
[3:04:53.480 --> 3:04:59.080]  in the north american union in the trans texas corridor well you know going on the you know i
[3:04:59.080 --> 3:05:04.600]  campaign for my cocky you know and and i'm at thousands of millennials you know and it's interesting
[3:05:04.600 --> 3:05:09.800]  to see how their take on our country and our world and uh and listen i put it actually i put
[3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:13.880]  them in my book some of the things the statements they made and they said you know they think that
[3:05:13.880 --> 3:05:19.960]  america has stretched her boundaries too far into other countries business and they say oh we believe
[3:05:19.960 --> 3:05:25.400]  that america overplays the role of world peace officer uh they believe america sends too much
[3:05:25.400 --> 3:05:30.840]  money abroad they bet they think we've uh dole out too much money for a foreign aid it's become an
[3:05:30.840 --> 3:05:36.760]  empire it has become an empire you know and i and listen to this uh you know uh brock obama
[3:05:36.760 --> 3:05:42.840]  wants to send 50 billion dollars to the united nations soon as he gets into office now and
[3:05:42.840 --> 3:05:48.760]  you know for the poor which sounds fine but the thing is when i was in korea alec you know i
[3:05:48.760 --> 3:05:55.080]  we uh that we have hundreds of orphanages over there in korea and uh so uh america was sending
[3:05:55.080 --> 3:06:02.920]  over thousands of dollars and uh food aid medical and money and only 10 percent of what was sent
[3:06:02.920 --> 3:06:08.120]  over there reached the orphanages 90 went into the pocket of corrupted politicians over there
[3:06:08.120 --> 3:06:13.480]  well remember after 9 11 when the even the red cross and others in united wayo got over 5 billion
[3:06:13.480 --> 3:06:17.480]  and then they said every dime would go but then they kept half of it and then gave some of the
[3:06:17.480 --> 3:06:23.880]  money to gun control groups yeah i know it's it's crazy and so the thing is that 50 billion dollars
[3:06:23.880 --> 3:06:28.920]  how much is really going to go to the poor and how much money is going to go in the pocket of
[3:06:28.920 --> 3:06:34.280]  the corrupted politicians in the united nations that's what concerns me we keep sending money out
[3:06:34.280 --> 3:06:38.600]  and the money's not going where it should be going and we you know so and plus we gotta worry
[3:06:38.600 --> 3:06:43.640]  about our people here in our own country we got the downtrodden the homeless we have we have a very
[3:06:43.640 --> 3:06:49.640]  poor people in our own country that needs to be taken care of first before we start doling out money
[3:06:49.640 --> 3:06:55.160]  to other nations absolutely the the the problem we face is we get different rhetoric from the
[3:06:55.160 --> 3:06:59.640]  two parties but when it comes to action and i know you're a loyal person and been quite loyal
[3:06:59.640 --> 3:07:03.560]  to republicans not i'm not really because at least on their platform they were better but i mean
[3:07:04.120 --> 3:07:09.000]  well i mean that's what i'm saying well what's your take on how both political parties now seem
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:12.440]  to be going in one direction you know 91 percent of the america people in gallup polls want to
[3:07:12.440 --> 3:07:18.440]  control our borders uh or or 70 plus percent don't want to be in iraq or you know on and on and in
[3:07:18.440 --> 3:07:24.760]  or 90 percent don't want to bail out but they're still trying to pass it yeah i you know i you know
[3:07:24.760 --> 3:07:31.640]  truthfully you know when the when the republicans were in control of the of the uh congress in those
[3:07:31.640 --> 3:07:37.400]  first six years of bush's uh you know uh they ran they ran into the ground so the democrats
[3:07:37.400 --> 3:07:42.920]  well will change everything will make everything better just so now the democrats have control
[3:07:42.920 --> 3:07:47.320]  of congress and they run a steeper into the ground i don't know who to trust i don't think i don't
[3:07:47.320 --> 3:07:54.120]  trust any of ron paul's the only guy i trust and uh and like i said you you heard alex you know i
[3:07:54.120 --> 3:07:59.400]  said if i had one wish you know if they give me one wish i'd like to line up all the members of
[3:07:59.400 --> 3:08:04.920]  congress and have ron paul walk with me down the line said okay which one's corrupted which one's
[3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:09.400]  corrupted and the one he says points to his corrupted almost took him unconscious and pile
[3:08:09.400 --> 3:08:16.920]  put stick him into a pile you know kind of an off thinner joke for me but well i saw that in the uh
[3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:22.840]  cleveland plain dealer and he said i'd keep uh sticking them in a pile piling them up to the
[3:08:22.840 --> 3:08:29.720]  marshal art star who at 68 looks as young and uh buff as in his walker texas ranger glory days
[3:08:29.720 --> 3:08:34.360]  the ones that are on us they stay you know and and and that's my next point and you get into
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:38.040]  some of this in the book but but you say that you're aware of some of the things i cover and and
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:44.440]  what ron paul gets into chuck a lot of conservatives listen to you they aren't aware like you are like
[3:08:44.440 --> 3:08:49.320]  i am right that the party has been taken over by these multinational corporations by the foreign
[3:08:49.320 --> 3:08:54.280]  lobbyists by the special interest you know i was asking you about the globalist the new world order
[3:08:54.280 --> 3:08:58.680]  the north american union uh the army times i know you're a big supporter of the military
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:03.160]  but but if we support the military we've got to keep them you know doing jobs that are constitutional
[3:09:03.160 --> 3:09:09.480]  they're announcing north com uh is is now going to have active duty brigades in the us to quote
[3:09:09.480 --> 3:09:15.240]  deal with uh civil unrest that i mean that violates posse common taught us and i know
[3:09:15.240 --> 3:09:20.120]  you're a big friend of law enforcement but the police i talked to they're getting upset
[3:09:20.120 --> 3:09:26.360]  about the spying on citizens you know the the excuse the threat of terrorism being used as a
[3:09:26.360 --> 3:09:32.280]  pretext to uh really have the government circle the wagons against the people so that we can't
[3:09:32.280 --> 3:09:36.520]  remove them from office coming can you speak to that well you don't think is that we can't you
[3:09:36.520 --> 3:09:44.520]  know the thing you know that it's such a complicated myth but i i agree with you alex you you cannot
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:51.000]  start spying on the uh on the citizens of america uh i mean we're getting them spying on
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:57.160]  what with the internet i mean but i mean i can't even blow my nose without somebody knowing it on
[3:09:57.160 --> 3:10:04.360]  the internet and uh it's it's crazy and uh you know that we're all an open book today uh with
[3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:10.120]  the the uh the with the wild frontier of the of the internet but the thing is we cannot have
[3:10:10.120 --> 3:10:17.240]  law enforcement going in and breaking down doors uh uh with just the suspicions but uh the thing is
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:21.880]  well that's the problem that's the problem is is that they're given these unfunded unfunded
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:25.880]  federal mandates are not allowed to do their constitutional jobs like control the borders
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:30.760]  and we have 800 plus sanctuary cities that are bankrupting the city county state governments
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:35.000]  everything's starting and then the police go out and squeeze and squeeze with asset for which
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:40.120]  are seizure and things that violate due process and in the most police i talk to personally
[3:10:40.120 --> 3:10:44.200]  they don't like what what's happening but they're basically being given these orders are i mean are
[3:10:44.200 --> 3:10:49.960]  we coming to the time when we need more and more police organizations to say no to unconstitutional
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:54.600]  actions like uh are you aware because it hasn't gotten a lot of attention not just gun confiscation
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:59.640]  in new orleans the governor who needs to be impeached in illinois a month ago i can play the
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:03.480]  clip if you want to hear it said that they want to use the national guard for gun sweeps and gun
[3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:10.200]  confiscation in the entire state of illinois oh boy oh that's not good where do you stand on gun
[3:11:10.200 --> 3:11:15.880]  confiscation well you know i i have a ranch you know and i i i i believe in the bearing arms i
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:21.880]  really do elix i believe the americans that have the right to bear arms and uh you know and uh
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:27.000]  the thing is i wouldn't want to when taking uh uh my guns away from me i'm on my ranch here
[3:11:27.640 --> 3:11:34.440]  but uh but the thing is has to be responsible you know i mean uh responsibility but the
[3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:39.240]  thing is with the constitution you know the constitution is being played from both ends
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:44.280]  you know it's a living document today you know it's not a solid document that it should be
[3:11:44.280 --> 3:11:48.440]  and patrick henry said it uh diligently i mean he said the constitution is not an
[3:11:48.440 --> 3:11:53.080]  instrument for the government to restrain the people it's an instrument yes people to restrain
[3:11:53.080 --> 3:11:57.400]  the government let it come to dominate our life i really believe the government is dominating our
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:12:02.440]  lives elix i believe that they are dictating everything that they feel we should do rather
[3:12:02.440 --> 3:12:07.720]  than us dictating to the the government what should be in our best interest and absolutely
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:13.320]  indicating me well you cover a lot of that in black belt patriotism how to reawaken america
[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:20.520]  chuck norris uh i mean you know i went i went to i went to the house i'm dc a few months ago my
[3:12:20.520 --> 3:12:28.520]  wife and i and and we walked into the house chamber and here's 435 uh congressman screaming at
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:33.320]  each other across the aisle and i'm watching if i came here myself think and they're screaming
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:41.240]  about some bill and i'm thinking here's here's 435 congressman looking like eighth graders
[3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:47.000]  screaming at each other and not getting anything resolved and finally the house speaker uh said
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:52.440]  okay uh that's enough time out everyone stopped and walked off i'm thinking this is like a eighth
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:56.520]  grade class where the teacher's gone and everyone's just going crazy and i said no wonder we get we
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:01.480]  don't get anything resolved in our country and if they even if they do resolve something
[3:13:01.480 --> 3:13:06.520]  then it's unedible you know it's like uh you know it is the bailout i mean all the money we're
[3:13:06.520 --> 3:13:13.320]  spending to aig and fanny may and pretty mac and and and and uh you know and now merrill lynch you
[3:13:13.320 --> 3:13:19.640]  know i have those are multinational corporations what these CEOs are getting for you know uh
[3:13:19.640 --> 3:13:24.920]  when they when they leave the company uh you know it's just crazy the amount of money these
[3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:30.120]  seals have run a company down and then they get a hundred million dollar bailout i mean it's crazy
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:34.360]  well well well chuck norris you know what's happening they've created all this false paper
[3:13:34.360 --> 3:13:39.000]  these derivatives that are nothing is backing them but the u.s taxpayer and most of these
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:43.720]  companies are global corporations secretary paulson's come out and said they want to bail out foreign
[3:13:43.720 --> 3:13:48.440]  banks but but this is a black hole that we can't bail out black hole alex and uh you know we're
[3:13:48.440 --> 3:13:53.000]  going to bail ourselves right into bankruptcy in our country well well chuck chuck a lot of people
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:58.040]  respect you on both sides of the aisle the american people i mean everybody i know loves chuck norris
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:14:01.720]  and and for people listening i know you're a smart guy and i know you you know you try to hold back
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:07.400]  and be you know an even-headed guy and and and be restrained but i mean tell us here in this interview
[3:14:07.400 --> 3:14:12.840]  with the six minutes we've got left bottom line what you think the individuals could do because
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:17.880]  we know the foreign interest of seas washington both parties i know you know that they're hiring
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:22.920]  felons for the military illegal aliens for the military they're turning mercenary forces
[3:14:23.560 --> 3:14:28.040]  loose that are now not even based in the u.s i know they signed a deal earlier this year for
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:31.960]  north com to use canadian and mexican troops in the u.s you're not aware of that i can give you
[3:14:31.960 --> 3:14:37.160]  the mainstream stories congress has been told they're not involved in that and uh you know i mean
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:42.120]  it's it's like in germany you're not against the german military if you're a german until bad people
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:47.240]  take control of it there has to be a point if they're planning to use the military against the american
[3:14:47.240 --> 3:14:51.160]  people that we say no so i mean are you against or are you aware that they're felons that they're
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:55.400]  now hiring for the military no i didn't i didn't know that but you know the thing is what i'm
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:15:02.360]  really concerned about is our people in america who work week to week and make the living from paycheck
[3:15:02.360 --> 3:15:07.880]  to paycheck and and and and and all of a sudden that becoming you know where they can't live from
[3:15:07.880 --> 3:15:13.080]  paycheck paycheck that's why i'm so in favor of the fair tax concept alex because the thing is
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:18.520]  there's 13 trillion dollars in offshore accounts yes you know that's where the super rich are
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:24.360]  hiding their money and so if we had a fair tax the super rich could bring their 13 trillion dollars
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:29.720]  back into our economy and give our economy a huge boost the three million manufacturing
[3:15:29.720 --> 3:15:34.200]  jobs that are being outsourced to other countries they can all come back because they're not going
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:38.760]  to be taxed to death you know we got that we we got income tax employment tax capital gains
[3:15:38.760 --> 3:15:43.960]  estate corporate property social security we're being taxed to death alex well you're right
[3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:49.160]  we're talking to chuck norris the new book black belt patriotism i have to say with this book it is
[3:15:49.160 --> 3:15:57.000]  it is i don't want to say eclectic but it's a great mix of health patriotism ways to fix america
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:02.120]  it also gets you know some into your uh... uh... martial arts history and and before you leave
[3:16:02.120 --> 3:16:06.760]  it about four minutes i just want to bring it up now or my listeners will kill me just a few words
[3:16:06.760 --> 3:16:11.240]  from you about what it was like uh... you know actually you know knowing bruce lee and being
[3:16:11.240 --> 3:16:15.640]  his best black belt and then starring in films with him what was that like well you don't think
[3:16:15.640 --> 3:16:21.240]  of bruce and became good friends why he was back in new york when i won the world title in 1968
[3:16:21.240 --> 3:16:25.640]  and then uh... you know we start working out together in l.a. and then he left for hong kong
[3:16:25.640 --> 3:16:29.880]  to pursue his movie career and i didn't hear from him for a couple years and then he called me out
[3:16:29.880 --> 3:16:33.960]  of the blue and said chuck i've done two movies and they're really successful i want to do a movie
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:39.000]  now about it with a fight scene in the call of simon roam with uh... and uh... i'd like for you
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:44.680]  to be my opponent so kiddingly i said well bruce who wins this fight i win i'm the star of this movie
[3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:49.000]  i said all because i held the world title at that time and i thought oh i think you want to beat up
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:54.360]  the world champion huh he said no i want to kill the world champion but you have to tell you who
[3:16:54.360 --> 3:16:58.840]  would have really won i mean in a no holds bar you know i don't know you know i was a special
[3:16:58.840 --> 3:17:03.160]  fighter but the thing is bruce was an incredible martial artist and you know you never want to
[3:17:03.160 --> 3:17:07.800]  say you could do something unless you proved it you know but i have to tell you i've done 23
[3:17:07.800 --> 3:17:14.440]  movies and 203 episodes of walker texas ranger and i've never gotten one encouraging review
[3:17:14.440 --> 3:17:19.880]  in all the years i've done in the entertainment world now i write a book by felt patriotism
[3:17:19.880 --> 3:17:25.560]  and i've got three five-star ratings one moment laura bernie wrote not being a huge chuck norris
[3:17:25.560 --> 3:17:30.920]  fan i wasn't sure what to expect having just finished it i have to confess that i was quickly
[3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:36.280]  drawn in and captivated by the contents of the book and actually pleasantly surprised by its
[3:17:36.280 --> 3:17:41.720]  insight depth research genuineness practicality and motivating nature this is not just another
[3:17:41.720 --> 3:17:46.920]  political diatribe it's a cultural cultural manifesto i have never gotten a review like that
[3:17:46.920 --> 3:17:52.280]  in my life alex well you know you know what's happening chuck a lot of the mainline liberals
[3:17:52.280 --> 3:17:56.120]  obviously were angry at your political stance on the second amendment and things like that
[3:17:56.120 --> 3:18:00.760]  but now they see so much and the left is disenfranchised with the left the right is
[3:18:00.760 --> 3:18:04.040]  disenfranchised with the right the people are figuring that out and coming together
[3:18:04.040 --> 3:18:08.520]  and there's a huge awakening happening and i appreciate your uh well i hope so because
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:12.760]  you know i'm i'm you know we need to get away from liberalism and conservatism
[3:18:12.760 --> 3:18:17.640]  and think about americanism alex well look at the crisis right now in closing i mean ron paul

[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:45.960]  we've already did over an hour with governor jesse ventura earlier i was talking to check norris
[3:23:45.960 --> 3:23:51.560]  during the break a little bit of amount of going on the web but we cut it off point is i forgot to
[3:23:51.560 --> 3:23:57.400]  add and he wanted me to add that 100 of the proceeds that you know that he's getting his 20 or whatever
[3:23:57.400 --> 3:24:04.440]  from the publisher goes to his kickstart foundation for children and i know that's a good foundation
[3:24:04.440 --> 3:24:08.440]  he has he's really into having real charities you heard him attacking charities that don't
[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:12.600]  actually do what they say they're gonna do but i mean this is just his book sale and so this is a
[3:24:12.600 --> 3:24:17.560]  pure charity kind of like paul newman and his foods what a great guy paul newman what a loss
[3:24:17.560 --> 3:24:22.360]  i've even talked about him i had that in my stack you know quotes about him you know by him saying
[3:24:22.360 --> 3:24:26.760]  hey i don't see myself as a philanthropist or some kind of angel i'm just like a farmer i believe
[3:24:26.760 --> 3:24:31.560]  you need to put back in the soil what you take out but yeah black belt patriotism really is a great
[3:24:31.560 --> 3:24:37.720]  book and uh... chuck norris is is wanting to support the republicans because he thought they were
[3:24:37.720 --> 3:24:42.440]  better than democrats now he's really waking up and he's a supporter of ron paul and and he told me
[3:24:42.440 --> 3:24:47.880]  off air and on air that you know he's been listed the show for years and then uh... you know he
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:52.120]  and he said we ought to get together sometime and people like him don't just say that so we'll see i
[3:24:52.120 --> 3:24:57.000]  think you're seeing the evolution of chuck norris i mean guys how exciting is that
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:01.880]  because you guys got to hear the behind the scenes pretty exciting huh i mean because what's
[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:06.600]  exciting to me is if i just had chuck norris on talking about just bruce lee or himself or
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:10.680]  just talking about movies that'd be interesting but i that's not what the show's about it's about
[3:25:10.680 --> 3:25:17.160]  these these icons and chuck norris is an icon i mean you know all these movies tv all the appearances
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:23.240]  i mean people love chuck norris uh... and uh... there's a million positive jokes about chuck
[3:25:23.240 --> 3:25:29.480]  norris how to how do the jokes go you know what there's so many of them and uh... to see him
[3:25:30.280 --> 3:25:35.560]  becoming a ron paul supporter so i'm wearing my ron paul shirt today ladies and gentlemen
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:40.760]  you see that people say aha he didn't win yes he did he was right he stuck to his guns he exposed
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:46.520]  the private fellow reserve he did a great job and so today we give you jessie ventura and chuck
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:52.280]  norris and uh... people say all celebrities don't matter always that why coca-cola and disney will
[3:25:52.280 --> 3:25:56.680]  pay millions of dollars for him to to to work for him is that why the government always wants
[3:25:56.680 --> 3:26:02.920]  celebrities to pitch their wars or pitch their police state actions or pitch their agenda no
[3:26:02.920 --> 3:26:09.160]  celebrities do matter and especially when they write a and you know great book like black belt
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:15.080]  patriotism and then getting people like chuck norris to be on the show and supporters of the
[3:26:15.080 --> 3:26:21.080]  show people like jessie ventura willy nelson charlie sheen uh... richard link letter let me tell you
[3:26:21.080 --> 3:26:28.680]  this uh... over a year ago i had rick link letter on this show year and a half ago director well

[3:27:05.640 --> 3:27:09.640]  longer for the republicans or the democrats now i see both sides of the paradigm now i know nine
[3:27:09.640 --> 3:27:14.280]  weapons and inside job and michelle malcolm the same one that said the marines didn't throw the
[3:27:14.280 --> 3:27:18.040]  puppy off the cliff and i was a liar in the same one that had her minions try to set me up in denver
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:22.440]  and failed there again miserably she won for a few days and lost she won the battle lost the war
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:29.640]  it's not works the truth will prevail um... she came out and said well we know somebody that knows
[3:27:29.640 --> 3:27:37.640]  him didn't give a name and uh... he says bruce willis didn't say that it's pure bull then six months
[3:27:37.640 --> 3:27:44.280]  later vanity fair bruce willis is on vacation turks and cacos in a fishing boat does an interview
[3:27:44.280 --> 3:27:48.760]  with vanity fair and says the same people that killed kennedy are running things down or basically

[3:27:53.480 --> 3:28:01.080]  all evil and bruce willis was like the number one front for the neocons and he was not a bad guy
[3:28:01.080 --> 3:28:07.400]  and let me tell you this guy was about number two so you see what we're doing folks we are

[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:37.320]  had him on about his book and he just says during a break he says now let's talk about nine eleven

[3:35:26.440 --> 3:35:32.040]  stuff um man there's a lot going on at the very end of the show i'm going to recap some of the
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:37.400]  things that are happening in the markets right now i wanted to jam in some phone calls uh now
[3:35:38.760 --> 3:35:41.480]  let's go ahead uh there's so many here who's up first
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:49.000]  bernard in california you're on the air go ahead hey how you doing Alex jones this is one of your
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:54.040]  supporters here and fire up man how you doing i'm doing pretty good hey man just really quick
[3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:57.640]  because i know you got your hands full there hey these animals have been attacking the united
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:02.280]  states within our congress need to be stripped away from whatever powers they have now and just
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:09.640]  incarcerated immediately this is a big eye opener in the way that it's never been attacked we have
[3:36:09.640 --> 3:36:16.840]  never been attacked in this form by our people that well the bankers did attack us in 1929 after
[3:36:16.840 --> 3:36:22.360]  they got control in 1913 to break under control so but this is much bigger and you're right
[3:36:22.360 --> 3:36:27.720]  nothing i mean the the attack on the stock market monday was one trillion two hundred billion point
[3:36:27.720 --> 3:36:35.880]  three that's a trillion two hundred billion ladies and gentlemen uh is just just just absolutely
[3:36:35.880 --> 3:36:42.440]  incredible and then the terrorism of the market economic terrorism in your face saying do what
[3:36:42.440 --> 3:36:50.200]  we say give the treasury unlimited uh power let them do whatever they want or the markets die and
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:54.840]  it's it's scared some people you know it was it was down to about six percent supporting the bell
[3:36:54.840 --> 3:36:59.080]  out now it's about ten percent supporting the bell out but uh the senate which is more controlled
[3:36:59.080 --> 3:37:04.120]  by the new world order only a hundred to buy instead of four hundred or something they are set
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:07.400]  to probably well they said this monday and live though so you don't know what's true
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:13.880]  the the media saying again that it's gonna pass tonight at seven o'clock uh we will see if that
[3:37:13.880 --> 3:37:21.080]  happens six central five mountain four pacific we are going to find out this evening correct
[3:37:21.080 --> 3:37:26.760]  some type of help is good but nothing so exaggerating as give me the power and all the money in the
[3:37:26.760 --> 3:37:32.920]  world so i can but this isn't exactly listen i'm against socialism but if we want to spend
[3:37:32.920 --> 3:37:36.920]  going to debt and devalue the dollar which in a way is it's already a dead duck i say
[3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:39.640]  if it was for the people go ahead but the government will always find some way to
[3:37:39.640 --> 3:37:44.120]  corrupt it or steal it but i mean if you took seven hundred billion and dole that out to the
[3:37:44.120 --> 3:37:48.200]  american people that would probably actually save the economy for three or four years a lot of
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:52.840]  economists are saying that i mean what seven hundred billion divided into you know a hundred
[3:37:52.840 --> 3:37:58.360]  and ninety million adults hey guys to do that on a calculator what is seven hundred billion
[3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:05.240]  divided uh into a hundred and ninety million adults or let's just say two hundred million adults
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:14.200]  what is what is three what is what is two hundred million divided into seven hundred
[3:38:14.200 --> 3:38:22.040]  billion it's really gonna be five trillion so tell it do five trillion divided into five
[3:38:22.040 --> 3:38:29.000]  trillion divided into two hundred million and we'll see how much money where it's getting here
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:34.120]  about so i mean folks this is not a bailout and the money is the diversion it's about the unlimited
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:41.000]  power and the fact that they're giving immunity anything else you want to add bernard bernard's
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:48.680]  gone uh steve and denver you're on the air something going on my phone system here
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:57.640]  houston are you there okay steve's not there either mark in oregon go ahead mark
[3:38:57.640 --> 3:39:05.720]  mark you want to see alex yes go ahead yes alex alex you know i've been thinking about
[3:39:06.360 --> 3:39:12.440]  you know the best tool of truth to use at this point in time given where we're at
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:20.200]  relative to the overall conspiratorial plan to destroy us all here and i came up with one
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:24.520]  word to extrapolate from into an idea and that word is keyboard crumb
[3:39:24.520 --> 3:39:35.320]  mom i thought about that first yes but uh that word is publicity and i thought out of publicity
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:42.440]  what would what would of all the different uh vehicles of publicity such as movies television
[3:39:42.440 --> 3:39:50.920]  radio the print media and given the blackout on truth media in this country anymore we've lost
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:57.160]  the fourth estate so it really what's replaced that fourth estate of a free press is really a
[3:39:57.160 --> 3:40:04.040]  blackout on truth which really makes it possible for the evildoers to do what they're doing and
[3:40:04.040 --> 3:40:08.280]  what they have to do the alternative media is fighting back and growing exponentially so the
[3:40:08.280 --> 3:40:12.760]  mainstream media is now admitting the government's getting ready to shut down the old web and have
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:17.960]  a highly restricted taxed and regulated web and so we've got to use the internet now like we've
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:23.640]  never done to expose the new world order every one of you can't sit on your hands now is the time
[3:40:23.640 --> 3:40:29.960]  to send emails right congress calling to talk shows start your own blogs uh you know uh to print
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:35.320]  up local newspapers there's a lot of business owners you can grab five or six a week articles
[3:40:36.040 --> 3:40:45.080]  out of the web and you can then go and you can uh you know publish that in a little newsletter
[3:40:45.080 --> 3:40:49.960]  for part of your city you know i mean yeah look it all has an effect anything else you want to
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:58.680]  answer yes sir when it comes to where you could fit into a massive publicity vehicle for the truth
[3:40:58.680 --> 3:41:05.960]  not being about you but being about about the exposure essentially as i see it of what happened
[3:41:05.960 --> 3:41:13.080]  on 9 11 because of the story of 9 11 the true story of it is exposed to in general to the
[3:41:13.080 --> 3:41:18.120]  people in the world through a massive publicity vehicle sure then the whole rest of the house
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:24.040]  of black cards falls down because if that is a lie and the true perpetrators are exposed
[3:41:24.040 --> 3:41:29.720]  of 9 11 then everything that they've done falls down with that story listen i hear you and i
[3:41:29.720 --> 3:41:35.880]  appreciate your call but listen here's what's happened you just perfectly exposed the illusion
[3:41:35.880 --> 3:41:43.640]  the majority of the world now knows 9 11's an inside job in 90 percent of the polls there's
[3:41:43.640 --> 3:41:50.280]  a few that just show a large minority but those are cut polls the vast majority of global polls
[3:41:50.280 --> 3:41:55.080]  the majority not just in arab countries but in asia you name it believe that they've been lied to
[3:41:55.080 --> 3:41:59.880]  and then a huge portion of that will say inside job to a telephone polar and most people you know
[3:41:59.880 --> 3:42:03.880]  don't want to say something radical over the phone they're scared but still we're getting a majority
[3:42:03.880 --> 3:42:11.800]  by the way do we have the next guest john oh okay i didn't know that i'm gonna at the very end of the
[3:42:11.800 --> 3:42:15.800]  show i will explain this paradigm this is so important i'm gonna write a note here we're
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:20.040]  going to do it i haven't had him on about a month and a half and it's this kind of guy that makes
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:27.240]  the show possible and it's also a way to save money um you know i only pitch things i believe in
[3:42:27.240 --> 3:42:32.120]  you know i say buy gold when it's 265 an ounce and you know it's been above a thousand and
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:37.160]  right up there at like 900 right now uh in just a few years you know it's at about 30
[3:42:37.160 --> 3:42:41.800]  gains a year the last eight years and the stock market's been losing the last eight years i believe
[3:42:41.800 --> 3:42:46.840]  in storable food and in now look even mainstream media saying getting it i believe in organic food
[3:42:47.480 --> 3:42:51.400]  more and more you know it's one thing to talk to talk but walk the walk and i've told the story
[3:42:51.400 --> 3:42:57.880]  but i'll tell it again about five years ago the sales manager uh was a republican at the time but
[3:42:57.880 --> 3:43:01.400]  he was also an environmentalist and he was really into organic stuff michael's redo and he said
[3:43:01.400 --> 3:43:05.640]  i'm using this incredible organic soap directly from the distributor i want you to have the guy
[3:43:05.640 --> 3:43:09.320]  on to an interview and i said i don't talk about stuff like that and he goes let me just send you
[3:43:10.040 --> 3:43:14.680]  a box and it came and i'd ignore soap i mean you know we already had some more expensive
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:18.600]  cruddy organic soaps that would still burn me under the arms and stuff that was better than
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:23.640]  and and i go what is this great soap and like a year later the year supply runs out just a box
[3:43:23.640 --> 3:43:27.960]  but it ran out in a year my wife goes i want more of that so i got more marty sent us more and then
[3:43:27.960 --> 3:43:32.920]  i got him as a sponsor i guess about three years ago i forget the point is because you go directly
[3:43:32.920 --> 3:43:37.880]  to him this was a way to save money in this economy you stop buying your detergents that eat your
[3:43:37.880 --> 3:43:42.200]  clothes you stop buying the chemicals there in the shampoos that give you all sorts of respiratory
[3:43:42.200 --> 3:43:48.440]  problems and asthma uh it's petrochemicals just like florides a byproduct of petrochemical and
[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:53.480]  they so they dump it in the water or d-use left over from the uranium enrichment so they use it
[3:43:53.480 --> 3:44:03.000]  as weapons that the globalists are masters the engineers are masters masters absolute masters
[3:44:04.280 --> 3:44:11.560]  uh at at taking their toxic ways and putting it into products we have a real self in 50 years
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:17.000]  in this country but 58 years ago or 57 i don't know 47 however long ago that was um
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:23.960]  um this gentleman with his father now his son runs it with with him uh marty schachter
[3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:29.400]  started the calvin pure subcompany and it is the best stuff because you get directly from him
[3:44:29.400 --> 3:44:34.440]  they never had direct sale the public till trudeau thought this up by the way it only went to
[3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:39.480]  institutions who were smart big hospitals five star hotels you think a five star hotel
[3:44:39.480 --> 3:44:43.560]  has some really expensive soap no they were smart they got the best organic soap low price
[3:44:43.560 --> 3:44:50.200]  see the elite smart folks well now you can do it and then that's my introduction marty 85%
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:56.680]  off supermarket prices for your uh real soap that's not toxic waste leftover from petrochemical
[3:44:56.680 --> 3:45:00.360]  production by the way he was in the chemical core in world war two so that he knows all about it
[3:45:00.360 --> 3:45:06.200]  marty it's great to have you here pleasure talking to you and your listeners alex i just got it so
[3:45:06.200 --> 3:45:12.040]  wonderful to be able to take care of the health and well-being of your listeners which we've been
[3:45:12.040 --> 3:45:18.040]  doing now for three years it's been wonderful and i appreciate it and i will continue doing this
[3:45:18.040 --> 3:45:25.000]  to help everyone i mean there's no one in the country no one that could give you a one to two
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:31.160]  years supply of pure soap products for around three bucks a week or a three to four years supply
[3:45:31.160 --> 3:45:38.760]  for two dollars and fifty cents a week over four to five year bulk supply of our pure soap products
[3:45:38.760 --> 3:45:45.960]  for two dollars a week nowhere know how we do it because we're direct from the factory we manufacture
[3:45:45.960 --> 3:45:52.760]  the goods we sell it direct to the consumer we unconditionally guarantee no quality of the product
[3:45:52.760 --> 3:45:58.040]  to 100 complete satisfaction now to explain this here and you know you were in the chemical
[3:45:58.040 --> 3:46:04.760]  core and to make it so for since 47s explain this to people well i was in 1945 i was drafted in the
[3:46:04.760 --> 3:46:10.760]  army assigned without my knowledge or know how to the united states chemical division sent to
[3:46:10.760 --> 3:46:16.040]  japan to monitor all the chemicals in the warehouses there but but but that was the next point i wanted
[3:46:16.040 --> 3:46:21.480]  to get to because i have an old encyclopedia that explains and i keep getting into bringing into the
[3:46:21.480 --> 3:46:28.200]  tv shows we also do tv here now and show people what what they admit health just from oil alone
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:32.600]  how they make all these derivatives and chemicals and before they would have each refinery every
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:38.920]  month thousands of tons sometimes of toxic waste until they wrote big papers on it in the 40s and
[3:46:38.920 --> 3:46:45.720]  50s will take over the soap industry and put the toxic waste in there or they'd have to store that
[3:46:45.720 --> 3:46:49.640]  and that would have been cost prohibitive i mean this is such an important point marty we're not
[3:46:49.640 --> 3:46:55.960]  joking about what's in soap tell them well the problem was when nazi germany was starting to win
[3:46:55.960 --> 3:47:01.560]  the war they were converting all the glycerins from the soaps that they were making into
[3:47:01.560 --> 3:47:08.600]  nitroglycerin or armaments and their chemists came up with a way of taking the waste petroleum
[3:47:08.600 --> 3:47:14.440]  and all the chemicals and making a synthetic detergent they called it synthetic which means
[3:47:14.440 --> 3:47:21.720]  artificial faults not true and they when the country was captured by united states and england
[3:47:21.720 --> 3:47:27.880]  they discovered the formulas and lever brothers an english company got the first break on it
[3:47:27.880 --> 3:47:35.240]  and they made a product called all a double l all as a detergent which cost pennies to make
[3:47:35.240 --> 3:47:42.040]  not dollars to make and it spread the proctor like colgate and the entire chemical industry
[3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:48.440]  were taking waste products and and sulfates and all the derivative chemicals that had no
[3:47:48.440 --> 3:47:58.280]  useful use dyes perfumes chlorides allows glycerins conditioners foods vitamins botanicals and
[3:47:58.280 --> 3:48:05.240]  antibacterials paraffin acids lanolin deodorants all incorporated into the cleaning products
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:11.720]  which cost very little to make and the whole industry took over and soap became an antique
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:20.360]  you couldn't buy it anymore that's why my father and i in 1947 61 years ago started a very small
[3:48:21.080 --> 3:48:28.520]  soap company i can't even do math i was saying 57 61 years ago 1947 to now we're 61 years we're
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:33.400]  still here we're family company we're family partnership now tell people what's in your
[3:48:33.400 --> 3:48:39.640]  soap real soap we make our products from coconut oils which we import from the philippines from
[3:48:39.640 --> 3:48:48.360]  the copper tree and vegetables of various kinds blended together to be safe to do the job not hurt
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:56.360]  harm pollute burn it does the job we've got tens of thousands of families coast to coast including
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:49:03.000]  canada including the caribbean including hong kong china that buys our products although
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:10.120]  china has massive big uh corporations that manufacture detergents they want pure soap and
[3:49:10.120 --> 3:49:15.960]  we're the families know most our drugs are being made in china now they put melamine plastic in the
[3:49:15.960 --> 3:49:22.200]  milk i mean this is insane folks you've got to get this soap now marty i wanted to ask you
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:26.840]  before we knew about you my wife at Whole Foods and they have some good products
[3:49:26.840 --> 3:49:31.320]  would buy organic subs and things they would cost two three times the detergent and a lot of times
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:36.520]  they would still burn me and stuff and the children why are your subs so different but we don't use
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:43.400]  one of the toxic ingredients actually only one which is perfumes perfumes are toxic you could
[3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:50.200]  take a drop of pure perfume put it on a walnut hardwood desk overnight it'll drill a hole in it
[3:49:50.200 --> 3:49:56.440]  just like a bullet hole it just burns now it's supposed to be a fragrance it's supposed to smell
[3:49:56.440 --> 3:50:02.760]  like flowers like the wheat field like wonderful air but it does more harm than you we don't use
[3:50:02.760 --> 3:50:11.000]  perfumes we use natural juices from coconuts from lemons from cherries from honey from oranges
[3:50:11.560 --> 3:50:16.680]  this is something that doesn't stay on the skin doesn't stay on the towel doesn't stay in the air
[3:50:16.680 --> 3:50:21.480]  it gives a little fragrance folks it's safe growing up we're gonna hold you over marty growing up my

[3:56:46.680 --> 3:56:53.160]  last week on the radio uh from a major san francisco station owned by disney and i immediately
[3:56:53.160 --> 3:56:59.160]  wrote it down because i wanted to share with you it starts like this there was a young maiden named
[3:56:59.160 --> 3:57:07.320]  marty who had an affair with a turtle with a swelling in her girdle and her mother found out

[3:57:20.360 --> 3:57:25.720]  about the basics you had the caller saying some massive event to expose 9-11's an inside job
[3:57:25.720 --> 3:57:31.160]  the world knows in all the polls it's an inside job and it's a lie that's why the america people

[3:57:36.920 --> 3:57:41.080]  the only illusion that's left is that we're the minority the only illusion left is that
[3:57:41.080 --> 3:57:45.320]  we're by ourselves and the public doesn't agree with us and there is you know 30 40 percent
[3:57:45.320 --> 3:57:49.640]  they're like zombies who repeat whatever they hear on tv and think you're kooky if you say that

[3:57:53.800 --> 3:57:58.920]  out there but they're becoming the minority they're a large minority close to half i'd say 40 percent
[3:57:58.920 --> 3:58:04.760]  but look five percent won the revolutionary war so 9-11 truth is exploding it's winning it's breaking
[3:58:04.760 --> 3:58:09.560]  paradigms it's destroying trust in the new world order and people are seeing false flag attacks

[3:58:20.600 --> 3:58:25.400]  not just for economic terrorism but biological terrorism staged or they'll claim it's an accident
[3:58:25.400 --> 3:58:30.920]  or terror or nuclear or something in the street or moose so we'll be covering that tomorrow live
