[00:00:05.077 --> 00:00:09.939]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:11.500]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.041]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:17.243]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.243 --> 00:00:29.909]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.710]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.151]  It is...
[00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:38.069]  April 20th, 2010.
[00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.492]  It's 420 Marijuana Head Day.
[00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:43.793]  It's also Adolf Hitler's birthday.
[00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:47.757]  I've always wondered why 420 is on Adolf Hitler's birthday.
[00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:55.242]  Speaking of Adolf Hitler, he liked to stage terror attacks as a pretext to shut down freedom in Germany and launch new wars.
[00:00:55.242 --> 00:01:00.507]  And our government, of course, has taken a lot of hints from Hitler's playbook.
[00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.108]  Here on Hitler's birthday.
[00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:18.013]  And by the way, we didn't see a staged terror attack yesterday, though Bill Clinton and others are out hyping it, saying there's going to be a terror attack and it's the fault of anybody criticizing the government.
[00:01:18.013 --> 00:01:22.094]  It's un-American, it's terrorists to criticize the government.
[00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:24.215]  You sit down and you shut up.
[00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.651]  Okay, and you turn those firearms in and they'll take good care of you.
[00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:37.633]  Because after all, Osama Bin Laden on his Facebook page says he's going to get you, and that's in Fox, CNN, you name it.
[00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:43.395]  Of course, then in the first line of the article at Fox News they admit that it's not Osama Bin Laden.
[00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:52.037]  Just a fake Facebook account.
[00:01:52.037 --> 00:01:52.677]  That's all it is.
[00:01:55.032 --> 00:02:01.838]  And every week or two we hear a new statement from Osama Bin Laden from a message board or a website and then it's always admitted it was an M-Lighter.
[00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:05.581]  It's like they claim they killed the top Al-Qaeda chiefs in...
[00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:16.949]  Iraq in the last two days and then when you go actually look up their names the government's claim they've killed them over and over and over again and have never retracted the previous times they killed them.
[00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.010]  I mean they could make up new Al Qaeda chief fake names.
[00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.712]  They want to set the precedent that they lie out in the open that's a psych warfare technique and just set the precedent they lie and that's the way it is.
[00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:33.053]  So that is some of what's coming up.
[00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:36.715]  Infowars.com reporter arrested yesterday.
[00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:39.416]  Aaron Dyches is now out of jail.
[00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:47.921]  Rob Jacobson and Rob Dube stayed up until about 4.30 in the morning.
[00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:49.782]  And I was up with them, but they were down at the jail.
[00:02:49.782 --> 00:02:55.345]  We also worked on trying to bail out some other people that were in there.
[00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:58.947]  In fact, I noticed Aaron just got back into the office.
[00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:00.669]  I need to get the full story from him.
[00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:09.217]  He will be in studio coming up today along with Rob Due and Rob Jacobson.
[00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:14.062]  And then we have Dr. Bob Bowman joining us.
[00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:19.908]  Now, we've had him on about 9-11 truth, we've had him on about nuclear weapons proliferation and geopolitical stratagem.
[00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:27.991]  But Dr. Bowman, nuclear physicist Bowman, Colonel Bob Bowman, was the head of the Star Wars program on record.
[00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:32.085]  He's given speeches on C-SPAN about it and a lot more.
[00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:37.950]  And he's been quite ill with cancer the last year, but I got to see him a few weeks ago at a 9-11 event in Austin.
[00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.651]  He still came.
[00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:41.152]  He's been in the hospital recently.
[00:03:41.152 --> 00:03:49.358]  And privately, he's told me as much as he can that's declassified about the real space program.
[00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:54.161]  The space program you see on the news is the facade.
[00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:56.323]  It is the curtain.
[00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:57.524]  And behind the curtain,
[00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:06.917]  The real NASA, the Pentagon, projects the fake NASA program on the screen.
[00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:12.659]  But they're behind the screen, behind the curtain, and the real world is going on back there.
[00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:19.222]  And so we're going to get Dr. Bob Bowman on today and get as much out of him as we can that's legal and lawful.
[00:04:19.222 --> 00:04:20.943]  And this was in the 70s and early 80s.
[00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:38.370]  He told me in a hotel green room before a speech, and I myself had done my own research, and I already knew this was part of the record, about the fleet of space planes they had in orbit in the late 70s.
[00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.598]  Of course, the media tells you the SR-71 Blackbird, developed in 52, in service in 55, it cruises at Mach 4.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.863]  They tell you that that is the fastest aircraft we've got.
[00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:53.863]  A 1952 aircraft.
[00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:59.327]  And the space shuttle.
[00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:00.728]  It's from 1935.
[00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:07.392]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.392 --> 00:05:12.515]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:13.996]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:27.440]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:05:29.588 --> 00:05:34.329]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:38.170]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.390]  Others don't.
[00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.530]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.311]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:46.211]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:52.833]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:55.533]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:57.894]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:05:57.894 --> 00:05:58.714]  Others don't.
[00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:06.736]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.736 --> 00:06:10.678]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:10.678 --> 00:06:12.899]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:18.782]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.782 --> 00:06:24.985]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:31.391]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:35.595]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:39.879]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:45.844]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:48.707]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.348]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:51.348 --> 00:06:52.469]  It's here.

[00:07:01.104 --> 00:07:08.650]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.134]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[00:07:13.134 --> 00:07:18.298]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[00:07:18.298 --> 00:07:20.440]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the
[00:07:26.823 --> 00:07:27.083]  I think?
[00:07:44.284 --> 00:07:47.366]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.382 --> 00:08:25.688]  If you just joined us, and you heard me talking about how the former head of the Star Wars program is going to be on with us in the third hour today, and I made the point that our government claims that the SR-71 Blackbird, built and designed in 50, 51, 52, according to the encyclopedia,
[00:08:34.383 --> 00:08:36.865]  Was in service by 54, 55, 56.
[00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:40.087]  There's different numbers I've seen.
[00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:41.748]  The point is mid-50s.
[00:08:41.748 --> 00:08:53.957]  If you believe that's the fastest aircraft that the Air Force has, I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona, and from my front porch you can see the sea, as good old George Strait says.
[00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:55.678]  And then I made the point going to break that
[00:08:56.238 --> 00:08:59.420]  The Space Shuttle is from the early 1930s.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.822]  Yes, you heard me right.
[00:09:00.822 --> 00:09:04.624]  You think it was developed in the 70s by Werner Von Braun?
[00:09:04.624 --> 00:09:08.367]  Well, yes, that's when they built it and then deployed it in the early 80s.
[00:09:08.367 --> 00:09:19.876]  But the Space Shuttle was drawn and sketched and designed by Werner Von Braun, the head of the Nazi Space and Weapons Rocket Program, V1 and all the rest of them.
[00:09:21.007 --> 00:09:23.091]  He designed it in the mid-1930s.
[00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:41.936]  has told me, and now more of it's come out, that NASA has them, the Air Force has them, and the only reason he could tell me about it is he talked about one of the directors of it later, who in a televised speech actually let out classified info.
[00:09:41.936 --> 00:09:45.117]  That's the only reason he could tell me that, was because it was now on the record.
[00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:52.041]  But he said that robotic space planes in the 70s and early 80s, when he was heading it up, and that's
[00:09:53.294 --> 00:09:54.635]  Well, he said a little more.
[00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:59.379]  He talked about DU meteor gun sabot rounds.
[00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:07.166]  And so we're going to talk about this today because I've had Dr. Bob Bowman on about 9-11 truth, about nuclear weapons proliferation.
[00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:10.488]  I've had him on many times on important issues.
[00:10:10.488 --> 00:10:12.230]  And he's a dynamic speaker.
[00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.253]  But he is ill with cancer.
[00:10:16.253 --> 00:10:17.214]  And he's been in the hospital.
[00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:26.695]  He's out of the hospital now, he's a great guy, and I think it's important we talk about this information.
[00:10:26.695 --> 00:10:41.628]  Hopefully he'll be with us for many, many more years, but I've learned you better talk to folks while you can, not once they've made the jump into hyperspace, once they've left this plane of existence.
[00:10:43.305 --> 00:10:55.668]  By the way, we've had her on, I don't know, four or five times over the years, and I saw an article that's linked up at Infowars.com from a great publication, Red Dirt Report.
[00:10:55.668 --> 00:10:59.708]  Red Dirt, because they got red dirt up there in Oklahoma like we got it in East Texas.
[00:10:59.708 --> 00:11:00.869]  And they just do great work.
[00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:05.149]  I mean, really scholarly reports and journalism out of the folks at the Red Dirt Report.
[00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:07.250]  And I was reading this this morning, and it was nothing new.
[00:11:08.444 --> 00:11:15.768]  But it just reminded me of how I haven't really covered the history of Oklahoma City in detail in a long time.
[00:11:15.768 --> 00:11:17.909]  We just had the 15th anniversary yesterday.
[00:11:17.909 --> 00:11:29.914]  Bill Clinton's running around, along with the White House, fear-mongering, saying there's going to be another big terror attack, and it's going to be the American people's fault when it happens, if we keep complaining, because we're going to cause this.
[00:11:29.914 --> 00:11:36.938]  And Limbaugh came out Friday, I've actually got the transcript, and said, no, it's going to be Bill Clinton and Obama's fault if it happens.
[00:11:37.478 --> 00:11:39.639]  They're going to cause it, and he just left it at that.
[00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:42.160]  But he's threatening them back, saying, look, I'll just go all the way.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.501]  Because there's no doubt Limbaugh knows about Oklahoma City.
[00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:47.862]  In fact, I've heard him allude to it years ago, being an inside job.
[00:11:47.862 --> 00:11:51.224]  He's even alluded to mass shootings, like Columbine being staged.
[00:11:51.224 --> 00:11:53.745]  And I'm not here worshipping Limbaugh.
[00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:56.566]  I just want to give credit when credit's due.
[00:11:56.566 --> 00:12:00.087]  I mean, I attack these big national talk show hosts when they do wrong.
[00:12:00.087 --> 00:12:03.969]  I support them when they're starting to tell the truth.
[00:12:03.969 --> 00:12:06.250]  Unfortunately, we don't see the same activities out of
[00:12:09.215 --> 00:12:22.886]  Some of the other big national hosts that we see out of Savage and Limbaugh but the Republicans are out of power right now so some of the big Republican talk show hosts can be a little bit more truthful with people but they interviewed
[00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:46.902]  Jane Graham, who worked for HUD in the building, and I've interviewed other witnesses that were in the building, and it just reminded me, she saw McVeigh, she saw guys with the explosives, she saw people with the wires, she saw them in the parking garage, she saw them in the maintenance area.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.763]  She saw them all.
[00:12:55.763 --> 00:12:58.550]  And other witnesses backed up what she saw.
[00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.456]  And she would come up and ask him, what is this?
[00:13:01.456 --> 00:13:02.519]  Oh, it's grey butter.
[00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:02.539]  C4.
[00:13:05.293 --> 00:13:06.854]  It's grey butter.
[00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:10.998]  And they were in there, and they didn't look like the regular maintenance crew.
[00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:13.720]  They were there for days, off and on.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.822]  She even identified some of them from the news footage.
[00:13:16.822 --> 00:13:20.405]  After the blast, she would point out people walking past the cameras.
[00:13:20.405 --> 00:13:21.066]  That's one of them.
[00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:21.686]  That's one of them.
[00:13:21.686 --> 00:13:23.087]  Yeah, they were there.
[00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:26.750]  And she almost died in the building.
[00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.732]  And there's so many of these witnesses.
[00:13:30.478 --> 00:13:36.481]  And when the grand jury tried to bring these witnesses forward, Hoppe Heidelberg, the foreman, he was told to not do it.
[00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:42.065]  And then the FBI came to his house brandishing firearms, telling him to shut his mouth.
[00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:44.126]  And then medical workers started dying.
[00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:46.707]  Police officers that were speaking out started dying.
[00:13:46.707 --> 00:13:48.008]  I mean, this was an inside job.
[00:13:48.008 --> 00:13:52.831]  We don't just get up here and talk about something being an inside job.
[00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.322]  Without having all the evidence.
[00:13:57.322 --> 00:14:12.009]  And so, coming up in the next few weeks, I'm going to do a whole 2-3 hours of the broadcast, just on Oklahoma City, and we're going to get, maybe get Pardon back on, the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, Hoppy Heidelberg, so many others.
[00:14:12.009 --> 00:14:15.311]  Jane Graham is coming on in the last 30 minutes today.
[00:14:16.932 --> 00:14:22.857]  After Dr. Bob Bowman leaves us, because this is just an eyewitness.
[00:14:22.857 --> 00:14:31.024]  It's now been released in federal court documents that the head of the anti-terror force of the FBI was in Oklahoma City in the week before.
[00:14:31.024 --> 00:14:32.985]  They lied about that later, got caught lying.
[00:14:33.946 --> 00:14:38.929]  It's on record the ATF showed up seconds after in full bomb gear, telling medics to bandage them up.
[00:14:38.929 --> 00:14:40.630]  They'd been on the ninth floor.
[00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.671]  It's on record the building blew out, not in.
[00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:50.116]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:14:50.116 --> 00:14:57.940]  Removing the bombs out of the building, on the news that day, three different news channels, the governor saying bombs, three bombs have been found.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.522]  It's ridiculous.
[00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:12.162]  Then you've got conflicting interviews with McVeigh where he said the government did this and then affidavits and Terry Nichols affidavits and then separately these tapes they've now been airing.
[00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.223]  All very suspicious.
[00:15:14.223 --> 00:15:16.104]  And again, Jane Graham saw McVeigh.
[00:15:16.104 --> 00:15:17.204]  She rode on the elevator with him.
[00:15:17.204 --> 00:15:19.165]  He was all over the building.
[00:15:19.165 --> 00:15:22.506]  She saw him multiple times stomping around everywhere.
[00:15:22.506 --> 00:15:28.188]  Tim McVeigh with men with federal passes to be in the building.
[00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:46.989]  And Camp Grouper, a few weeks before, police officers who own their own private plane were flying over the military base on the edge of a national park and saw a Ryder truck being loaded with fuel oil and thought it was suspicious enough to take photos of it.
[00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:51.594]  I mean, the evidence just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:15:56.877 --> 00:16:05.020]  And since the globalists are getting ready to carry out OKC2, there's no doubt about it, they're playing the exact same propaganda that led up to what they did.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.521]  They've got drills coming up later this month and in May.
[00:16:08.521 --> 00:16:17.324]  And I've said going into late April, into May is the key danger zone from all the propaganda crescendo I've seen building up.
[00:16:17.324 --> 00:16:21.185]  So we are in a red alert situation.
[00:16:24.209 --> 00:16:25.849]  No one was that specific.
[00:16:25.849 --> 00:16:26.550]  Other people noticed.
[00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.330]  I've now learned in hindsight.
[00:16:41.806 --> 00:16:47.650]  That they were hyping Bin Laden, and that he was going to get us, and people said, look for a fake attack, they'll blame on Bin Laden.
[00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.490]  I mean, it was obvious.
[00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:52.513]  That's one reason I knew, was just the incredible hype.
[00:16:52.513 --> 00:17:05.782]  And so, it's not just Alex Jones noticing this today, it is people in Congress, it's Rush Limbaugh, it's Michael Savage, it's countless other bloggers and talk show hosts, and that's the good news.
[00:17:05.782 --> 00:17:09.765]  The feds did this in 93, they cooked the bomb, trained the driver, ordered their
[00:17:11.149 --> 00:17:13.150]  Informant to do it, then tried to set him up.
[00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:18.291]  He recorded the FBI admitting that they'd ordered him to cook the bomb and carry it out.
[00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:21.252]  That came out in the New York Times, CBS News.
[00:17:21.252 --> 00:17:22.912]  That's, by the way, an Invisible Empire.
[00:17:22.912 --> 00:17:27.253]  They just released the audio of that last year.
[00:17:27.253 --> 00:17:29.914]  So it's now an Invisible Empire, in order to find the new film.
[00:17:29.914 --> 00:17:34.815]  That's just a few minutes of the two-hour, 20-plus minute documentary to give you an idea of what it chronicles.
[00:17:34.815 --> 00:17:37.476]  It basically covers it all.
[00:17:37.476 --> 00:17:38.036]  And then you get
[00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:57.870]  The cover-up of Waco and the mass murder there by the Feds and the Delta Force and the rest of them and everybody's angry at the government and there's this big states rights movement and so to play the part of the victim the Feds bomb OKC and now Bill Clinton's running around saying, gee I hope there didn't have to be a terror attack to shut down all of this dangerous rhetoric.
[00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.172]  Gee I hope we don't have to
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:13.034]  Have this happen before all these evil people stop speaking out.
[00:18:13.034 --> 00:18:14.357]  But it's not going to work, my friends.
[00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:24.748]  Because we got an education in 93, we got an education in 95, we got an education in 2001, and now we're about to get an even bigger education.
[00:18:24.748 --> 00:18:31.450]  But so many people are aware of false flag terror now, that the system better watch it, because our people are everywhere.
[00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:45.935]  They're inside the FBI, they're inside the federal marshals, they're inside the state police, they're inside the military, they're inside the National Guard, they're inside the CIA, they're inside the National Security Agency, they are inside city government, county government,
[00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:49.817]  And they are citizens on the streets and our people are watching.
[00:18:49.817 --> 00:18:52.498]  We are the real guardians of the homeland.
[00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:55.820]  We are the real Homeland Security Brigade.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:03.184]  And we know your game plan and we're calling you out and calling you on the carpet before you do it.
[00:19:04.758 --> 00:19:10.303]  We saw you when you were coming a mile away, and now you're on our front porch, and there's no doubt what you're doing.
[00:19:10.303 --> 00:19:22.413]  You think the public's so dumb, and there is a dumbed-down segment that they're playing to, but the rest of us can see what you're doing, how obvious it is, how you're prepping everyone for this.
[00:19:22.413 --> 00:19:26.277]  So the number one issue is we are now in the danger zone.
[00:19:26.277 --> 00:19:30.440]  Maybe I ought to cue up the corny Top Gun music and come back with danger zone.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.222]  Go to YouTube and Google danger zone.
[00:19:34.045 --> 00:19:35.205]  Highway to the Danger Zone.
[00:19:35.205 --> 00:19:40.586]  We're gonna come in with Highway to the Danger Zone.
[00:19:40.586 --> 00:19:43.567]  But it's not a joke, it's not a game, it's life and death.
[00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:48.928]  I'm risking my life, my name, my treasure, everything here to tell it like it is.
[00:19:48.928 --> 00:19:52.489]  Alright, we got a bunch of other news I haven't even hit on yet coming up.
[00:19:52.489 --> 00:19:55.529]  And two very important informative guests today.
[00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:57.850]  And we've got Aaron Dyches coming in who was arrested last night.
[00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.350]  We'll tell you what happened with Karl Rove.
[00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.810]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.383 --> 00:20:02.304]  You worry.
[00:20:02.304 --> 00:20:04.326]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:20:04.326 --> 00:20:06.868]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:20:06.868 --> 00:20:08.949]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:20:08.949 --> 00:20:10.571]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:20:10.571 --> 00:20:14.154]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:20:14.154 --> 00:20:18.998]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:20:19.398 --> 00:20:23.199]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:20:23.199 --> 00:20:24.880]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.741]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:20:27.741 --> 00:20:31.062]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:20:31.062 --> 00:20:39.485]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:20:39.485 --> 00:20:44.187]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:53.472]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:55.194]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:21:01.047 --> 00:21:04.029]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:08.171]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:10.432]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:10.432 --> 00:21:15.595]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:21:15.595 --> 00:21:17.416]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:18.977]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.457]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:21:20.457 --> 00:21:23.819]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:21:23.819 --> 00:21:28.842]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:21:29.182 --> 00:21:29.442]  We're good.
[00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:44.459]  I think so.
[00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.975]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:22:02.975 --> 00:22:05.358]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:05.358 --> 00:22:08.583]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:13.689]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.689 --> 00:22:17.875]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:18.175 --> 00:22:20.638]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:20.638 --> 00:22:23.422]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:23.422 --> 00:22:26.326]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:26.326 --> 00:22:33.936]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:34.276 --> 00:22:39.660]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.502]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:42.502 --> 00:22:46.204]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:46.204 --> 00:22:47.285]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:47.285 --> 00:22:48.606]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:48.606 --> 00:22:50.107]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.393]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:03.393 --> 00:23:05.675]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:06.535]  Don't!
[00:23:06.535 --> 00:23:09.978]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:09.978 --> 00:23:17.124]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:23:17.104 --> 00:23:19.085]  's number one debt secret.

[00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:25.350]  Yes, free for a very limited
[00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:33.657]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:33.657 --> 00:23:34.838]  Herb K. was right.
[00:23:34.838 --> 00:23:38.060]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.482]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:39.482 --> 00:23:40.763]  Stop the calls now.
[00:23:40.763 --> 00:23:42.784]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:23:42.784 --> 00:23:43.485]  Get Herb K.'

[00:23:47.328 --> 00:23:47.508]  That's 800-822-1291.
[00:23:54.838 --> 00:24:11.512]  800-822-1291 Oh yeah, we're in the danger zone!
[00:24:11.512 --> 00:24:18.158]  The federales and the private mercs are getting ready to stage some terror and use homeland security on the American people.
[00:24:22.398 --> 00:24:23.399]  Enemies coming in.
[00:24:23.399 --> 00:24:26.902]  We can see them.
[00:24:26.902 --> 00:24:30.346]  Continue firing truth salvos back at them.
[00:24:30.346 --> 00:24:31.227]  We've got the truth.
[00:24:31.227 --> 00:24:32.228]  We've got the initiative.
[00:24:32.228 --> 00:24:34.730]  We're going to fight our way out of this.
[00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.493]  We're going to blast our way out of it with the info war.
[00:24:37.493 --> 00:24:42.678]  And they're not going to stop us.
[00:24:42.678 --> 00:24:43.499]  Put it in high gear.
[00:25:22.751 --> 00:25:24.951]  Come on folks, break your conditioning.
[00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:29.812]  Face the fact we have a bunch of wicked crooks running our society.
[00:25:29.812 --> 00:25:38.294]  Realize that this Homeland Security system that we've warned you about for years is now admittedly for the American people.
[00:25:38.294 --> 00:25:39.514]  See through the fog.
[00:25:39.514 --> 00:25:41.555]  See clearly.
[00:25:41.555 --> 00:25:43.995]  It's right out in the open.
[00:25:43.995 --> 00:25:45.716]  The enemy thinks you're fools.
[00:25:45.716 --> 00:25:49.696]  I know better.
[00:25:49.696 --> 00:25:52.257]  And it's not going to take the majority of us to beat these people.
[00:25:55.461 --> 00:25:58.016]  It's always a committed minority that defeats tyranny.
[00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:24.928]  We're all in the danger zone together right now.
[00:26:24.928 --> 00:26:27.589]  Make no mistake, this isn't a drill.
[00:26:27.589 --> 00:26:29.650]  The bankers are making their move.
[00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.331]  The carbon tax is the takeover of the internet.
[00:26:33.331 --> 00:26:35.732]  Everything is happening right now.
[00:26:35.732 --> 00:26:38.973]  We're going deep into the new world order.
[00:26:38.973 --> 00:26:45.915]  We can use the enemy's assault as a wake-up to rouse the sleeping giant that is America.
[00:26:57.043 --> 00:27:02.207]  Okay, coming up today, Jane Graham, Oklahoma City bombing survivor.
[00:27:02.207 --> 00:27:09.171]  Headline, Murrow bombing survivor says feds involved in blast that killed 168 and 95.
[00:27:12.313 --> 00:27:18.094]  CFR journalist on Chris Matthews calls Tea Party talk seditious, illegal.
[00:27:18.094 --> 00:27:21.015]  Criticizing the government is illegal, according to them.
[00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:24.036]  Bill Clinton, Rush Limbaugh doesn't make any sense, he says.
[00:27:24.036 --> 00:27:29.557]  Bill Clinton fired back at radio host Rush Limbaugh over the weekend, said the conservative talker doesn't make any sense.
[00:27:29.557 --> 00:27:36.459]  In an exclusive interview with ABC, Limbaugh said Friday that Clinton and Barack Obama will be responsible for any future domestic terror attack.
[00:27:37.597 --> 00:27:46.243]  After taking exception to language Clinton used in an event that morning while speaking about the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:27:46.243 --> 00:28:02.315]  I'm going to say right now, if there's any future incident, this is an Oklahoma City bombing, to blame it squarely on the shoulders of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, Rush Limbaugh said.
[00:28:02.315 --> 00:28:06.899]  He's barely holding back, ladies and gentlemen, and Savage isn't saying they're going to blow something up.
[00:28:09.508 --> 00:28:13.670]  Hmm, that's 30-plus million people hearing the truth.
[00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:15.531]  Globalists, you really think you want to do this?
[00:28:15.531 --> 00:28:23.554]  You really think you want to run this assault on us when, I'd say conservatively, 30-40% of the country knows exactly what's going on now?
[00:28:23.554 --> 00:28:30.016]  5% beat you in 1776 over that seven-year war that kicked off in 1775.
[00:28:34.229 --> 00:28:39.912]  The will to resist beat you in 1776, even though the war wasn't won for many years.
[00:28:39.912 --> 00:28:43.134]  And you know we've got the initiative, you know we've got the truth.
[00:28:43.134 --> 00:28:47.937]  And no amount of fluoride to dumb us down in the water is gonna control us.
[00:28:47.937 --> 00:28:51.879]  Do you understand that?
[00:28:51.879 --> 00:28:54.861]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[00:28:54.861 --> 00:29:00.044]  They're using the NSA to track good police officers, state, federal, and local.
[00:29:02.779 --> 00:29:07.142]  That's been declassified to track who knows what they're up to.
[00:29:07.142 --> 00:29:21.334]  So if you are a police officer, or you are an FBI agent, or you are in the Pentagon, and you find out they're about to stage a terror attack, what they killed more than 15 people, who witnessed Cheney trying to sneak nukes out of the country a few years ago, remember that?
[00:29:21.334 --> 00:29:22.635]  With the Minot nukes?
[00:29:24.878 --> 00:29:30.119]  You better immediately go on YouTube or Google or a live radio show when you blow the whistle.
[00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:36.081]  Because if you start calling your buddies and stuff and asking them if you should go public, the NSA is going to click over.
[00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:41.342]  It's going to put out an order to a death squad and they're going to murder you and your family within an hour.
[00:29:41.342 --> 00:29:43.802]  They got death squads in every city.
[00:29:43.802 --> 00:29:45.723]  There's a contingency plan.
[00:29:45.723 --> 00:29:51.204]  So when you do catch the next McVeigh and you're building planning bombs, you better watch it.
[00:29:51.204 --> 00:29:52.585]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.585 --> 00:29:54.105]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.106 --> 00:30:00.348]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.348 --> 00:30:04.589]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:30:04.589 --> 00:30:05.849]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:05.849 --> 00:30:09.751]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.751 --> 00:30:12.031]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:12.031 --> 00:30:17.873]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:17.873 --> 00:30:24.095]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.535 --> 00:30:30.519]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:34.702]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.702 --> 00:30:38.985]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:38.985 --> 00:30:44.930]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.492]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.492 --> 00:30:50.473]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.473 --> 00:30:50.894]  It's here.

[00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:03.883]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.883 --> 00:31:09.207]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:09.207 --> 00:31:11.248]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:11.248 --> 00:31:16.272]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:16.272 --> 00:31:17.452]  How much do you want?
[00:31:17.452 --> 00:31:18.173]  When do you want it?
[00:31:18.553 --> 00:31:20.434]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:20.434 --> 00:31:21.515]  When will you need it?
[00:31:21.515 --> 00:31:23.717]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:23.717 --> 00:31:25.058]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:25.058 --> 00:31:26.579]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:26.579 --> 00:31:31.843]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.843 --> 00:31:34.965]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:35.425 --> 00:31:39.248]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:39.248 --> 00:31:40.469]  How much will you need?
[00:31:40.469 --> 00:31:41.370]  We don't know.
[00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:42.491]  How much do you want?
[00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:43.231]  All you can get.
[00:31:43.231 --> 00:31:44.512]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.512 --> 00:31:47.555]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:47.555 --> 00:31:49.336]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:49.336 --> 00:31:50.257]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:01.075 --> 00:32:02.958]  Don't answer it!
[00:32:02.958 --> 00:32:11.068]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[00:32:53.615 --> 00:32:53.796]  That's 800-477-9256.
[00:33:01.184 --> 00:33:18.709]  Before you slip into unconsciousness... Coming up at the start of the next hour, Aaron Dice is going to be in studio talking about how he and others were arrested for asking Lord Rove questions.
[00:33:18.709 --> 00:33:23.491]  They had said they weren't going to take questions, and then Rove announced, yes, I will take questions.
[00:33:23.491 --> 00:33:28.132]  I have prepared cue cards here of questions submitted before the event.
[00:33:29.249 --> 00:33:33.833]  So he had staged questions, so other people started saying, no, we have questions.
[00:33:33.833 --> 00:33:40.239]  And then Aaron got up and said, I have a question, with his hand raised, and the police drug him out and arrested him.
[00:33:40.239 --> 00:33:46.245]  Then he started basically screaming that Karl Rove's responsible for mass murder in Iraq.
[00:33:46.245 --> 00:33:47.726]  That's up on Raw Story right now.
[00:33:47.726 --> 00:33:54.973]  We have some video of it up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:33:58.024 --> 00:34:03.646]  Infowars journalist arrested, held for asking Karl Rove a question during UT appearance.
[00:34:03.646 --> 00:34:09.828]  And then in classic Rovian propaganda, he said, you will not be arrested until you've been given three warnings.
[00:34:09.828 --> 00:34:11.648]  Aaron was not given one warning.
[00:34:11.648 --> 00:34:14.389]  He was drug out and arrested.
[00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:23.752]  And we bailed him out and one other We Are Change person that didn't have anybody there at the jail to get him at about 4 a.m.
[00:34:23.752 --> 00:34:26.253]  So we bailed them both out and paid for that last night.
[00:34:27.694 --> 00:34:31.215]  Another, another cost of the info war.
[00:34:31.215 --> 00:34:37.576]  And then of course, Dr. Bob Bowman joining us in about an hour and a half.
[00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:43.478]  And then we have Jane Graham, the last 30 minutes.
[00:34:43.478 --> 00:34:47.579]  Borough bombing survivor says feds involved in blasts that killed 168 in 1995.
[00:34:47.579 --> 00:34:50.179]  She witnessed McVeigh in the building and others with
[00:34:57.679 --> 00:35:00.500]  Large sticks of grey butter and wires.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.502]  Doing maintenance days before.
[00:35:03.502 --> 00:35:07.203]  Special maintenance with their federal badges.
[00:35:07.203 --> 00:35:10.165]  Special maintenance.
[00:35:10.165 --> 00:35:11.646]  And then that should be a message to you.
[00:35:11.646 --> 00:35:14.847]  Look how McVeigh ended up with the feds and he was clearly black ops.
[00:35:14.847 --> 00:35:17.328]  That's been sworn in federal affidavits.
[00:35:17.328 --> 00:35:25.172]  Look how... Look what they did to Hal Turner, their FBI agent.
[00:35:27.165 --> 00:35:29.906]  He's in trial right now, probably going to go to prison.
[00:35:29.906 --> 00:35:36.608]  Look what they do to you guys that engage in these operations for them.
[00:35:36.608 --> 00:35:40.809]  Not a good idea to work for the New World Order, is it?
[00:35:40.809 --> 00:35:42.329]  And the answer is no, it's not.
[00:35:42.329 --> 00:35:45.670]  Now remember about two months ago, I'm going to cover a bunch of different news stories right now.
[00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:51.772]  Remember about two months ago, it broke in Philadelphia.
[00:35:52.987 --> 00:35:55.808]  That government paid for, i.e.
[00:35:55.808 --> 00:36:05.852]  taxpayer paid for, laptops had been issued, issued to all of the high school students.
[00:36:05.852 --> 00:36:09.574]  Now they're issuing them to even elementary students in the 5th grade, different parts of the country.
[00:36:10.956 --> 00:36:18.718]  And that the school began to brag and call parents at home and said, we saw your son doing something he wasn't supposed to.
[00:36:18.718 --> 00:36:19.378]  Well, we now know.
[00:36:19.378 --> 00:36:22.018]  It was eating Skittles in his bed.
[00:36:22.018 --> 00:36:30.840]  And the Skittles, rainbow-flavored candies, fruit-flavored candies, are now drugs.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.781]  And now we have the emails released from the school.
[00:36:33.781 --> 00:36:36.201]  That came out last Friday.
[00:36:36.201 --> 00:36:39.682]  There's a new story out of philly.com, Philadelphia Inquirer today.
[00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:47.354]  With the emails of the school administrators bragging and saying, I'm addicted to this, I can't stop watching them.
[00:36:47.354 --> 00:36:48.975]  It's better than a soap opera.
[00:36:48.975 --> 00:36:56.539]  Watching their families, watching people in their bathrooms, watching people in their bedrooms, watching disrobed teens.
[00:36:56.539 --> 00:36:58.540]  This is child pornography.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:03.163]  But what's interesting here is the school told on itself that they were conditioning people.
[00:37:03.163 --> 00:37:04.324]  Hey, we're watching you at home now.
[00:37:05.609 --> 00:37:08.571]  No warrant, no judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:37:08.571 --> 00:37:23.281]  And the bigger issue is, all over the country the last decade, we've seen it in Tennessee, California, you name it, mainstream news articles where they have cameras in the gymnasium showers.
[00:37:23.281 --> 00:37:29.785]  And they admit they're in the showers, and they're in the bathrooms, they're in the toilet stalls, they're in the classrooms, they're everywhere watching you.
[00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:37.157]  And of course, we've told you that Google, Yahoo, and others have patented technology to watch you over your built-in cameras and listen to you on the microphones.
[00:37:37.157 --> 00:37:41.341]  But they say, don't worry, we have computers recording the video and analyzing it.
[00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:48.168]  And if they hear a dog barking in the background, we then implant Google ads for dog food or dog Frisbees or toys.
[00:37:48.168 --> 00:37:49.870]  That's a big market.
[00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:50.931]  Animal products, as you know.
[00:37:53.083 --> 00:37:54.604]  One of the biggest growing markets.
[00:37:54.604 --> 00:37:57.107]  It's always been big, but it's huge.
[00:37:57.107 --> 00:37:58.768]  They're like children now.
[00:37:58.768 --> 00:38:01.451]  People get multi-thousand dollar a month vet bills in many cases.
[00:38:02.987 --> 00:38:04.388]  And they're just listening to you.
[00:38:04.388 --> 00:38:05.809]  They're watching you.
[00:38:05.809 --> 00:38:11.434]  And so I've heard talk show hosts nationally and locally kind of halfway defending this now.
[00:38:11.434 --> 00:38:14.496]  Like, oh, well, they thought they had six laptops stolen.
[00:38:14.496 --> 00:38:15.217]  That's the excuse.
[00:38:15.217 --> 00:38:18.320]  But the school up front said, no, we're just watching you at home.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:26.046]  Now it turns out Lower Marion Report, the school's called Lower Marion School District, webcams snapped 56,000 images
[00:38:30.086 --> 00:38:37.070]  of students inside their homes.
[00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.511]  56,000.
[00:38:38.511 --> 00:38:53.780]  See, as the lawsuit gets deeper, as they're forced to release their emails and internal documents, 56,000 images, and they've got all these quotes about, oh my gosh, I just love it, this is better than a soap opera, I'm obsessed.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.920]  These are quotes.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.841]  I'm obsessed.
[00:39:00.273 --> 00:39:04.037]  Yes, they're obsessed with playing God, watching people in their homes.
[00:39:04.037 --> 00:39:06.299]  And let me explain something to you.
[00:39:06.299 --> 00:39:09.122]  The federal government paid for these.
[00:39:09.122 --> 00:39:16.210]  The federal government part of the plan makes a school sign an agreement that it will have this remote control technology to, quote, have loss retrieval.
[00:39:19.475 --> 00:39:32.607]  And that this has been rolled out everywhere, and if your student has a government-issued laptop, there is a very good chance this is going on in your town, your city, your school district, right now.
[00:39:35.225 --> 00:39:40.750]  So a new chapter in this Orwellian story today.
[00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.352]  This is how bad it is.
[00:39:42.352 --> 00:39:48.938]  And of course, the NSA, police departments, they're all merging, the CIA's merging locally and threat integration centers.
[00:39:50.399 --> 00:39:57.140]  Again, years ago we had internal Homeland Security documents, not just the new ones we got last year, where the whole thing is set up for the American people.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:04.662]  It has nothing to do with turbaned CIA patsies living in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[00:40:04.662 --> 00:40:06.082]  A zero!
[00:40:06.082 --> 00:40:07.262]  Zilch!
[00:40:07.262 --> 00:40:08.442]  Nada!
[00:40:08.442 --> 00:40:11.523]  Zippo!
[00:40:11.523 --> 00:40:13.423]  You are the target.
[00:40:13.423 --> 00:40:17.004]  You are the people that this system is going after.
[00:40:27.503 --> 00:40:32.584]  But again, the school told on themselves.
[00:40:32.584 --> 00:40:36.406]  I remember a case that had to be, and I've talked about it a lot, we need to pull this back up.
[00:40:36.406 --> 00:40:47.589]  I remember it was seven, eight years ago in Tennessee, and a visiting basketball team came to the middle school basketball game, and the girls were taking showers after the game.
[00:40:49.853 --> 00:40:50.133]  I don't know.
[00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:14.951]  Shower area, but the visiting team wasn't under mind control and panicked.
[00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:20.972]  There was a big scene in the parking lot and parents threatening to attack people and a normal response.
[00:41:20.972 --> 00:41:23.333]  And school officials were in the newspaper.
[00:41:23.333 --> 00:41:25.433]  I gotta pull that up.
[00:41:25.433 --> 00:41:28.394]  I didn't forget the town.
[00:41:28.394 --> 00:41:29.334]  Well, and what's the big deal?
[00:41:29.334 --> 00:41:30.215]  There could be crime.
[00:41:30.215 --> 00:41:33.115]  There could be crime in the showers, yes.
[00:41:33.115 --> 00:41:34.536]  There could be crime in your bedrooms.
[00:41:34.536 --> 00:41:36.096]  We need cameras in your bedroom, just like England.
[00:41:37.646 --> 00:41:46.617]  20 plus thousand now in a pilot program have cameras in their home for the first six months of a new baby in case they're abusive.
[00:41:46.617 --> 00:41:54.987]  Guilty until proven innocent, pre-crime, and they watch you and how you feed your baby and what you do with cameras paid for by taxpayers in every room of the home.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:04.003]  And remember three years ago, Houston Police Chief, just search this term, Houston Police Chief calls for cameras in homes.
[00:42:04.003 --> 00:42:06.845]  I mean, they're really pushing this on us.
[00:42:06.845 --> 00:42:16.870]  They think we're going to accept this.
[00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:20.272]  Continuing, another article here from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:22.705 --> 00:42:23.026]  U.S.
[00:42:23.026 --> 00:42:27.232]  troops apologize for WikiLeaks massacre video.
[00:42:27.232 --> 00:42:35.985]  Two veterans of a company shown in collateral murder footage, the helicopter footage, say video only begins to depict the suffering we have created.
[00:42:37.503 --> 00:42:56.192]  Two soldiers who were in the same company as the culprits featured in the infamous WikiLeaks collateral murder video which showed troops in Apache helicopters slaughtering Reuters cameramen and children while laughing about it have apologized for the massacre while stating that the footage only begins to depict the suffering inflicted upon innocent Iraqis as a consequence of the occupation.
[00:42:56.852 --> 00:43:01.353]  The WikiLeaks video provoked international firestorm earlier this month after it showed U.S.
[00:43:01.353 --> 00:43:12.176]  troops slaughtering over a dozen innocent people, including two Reuters employees and the father of two children who were trapped in a rescue vehicle that also came under fire.
[00:43:12.176 --> 00:43:16.297]  The two children survived but were badly wounded.
[00:43:16.297 --> 00:43:25.339]  One of the soldiers who wrote the letter of apology for the massacre, Ethan McCord, was the man who rescued the children from the van after his colleagues had finished bombarding it with gunfire.
[00:43:26.277 --> 00:43:30.980]  Conscious of the fact that children were inside, while chuckling and making excuses for themselves.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:41.648]  Yeah, you hear the troops go up, the ground troops that show up in Bradleys, and they save the bleeding children, and they say, you know, we've got two children wounded, and you hear the helicopter pilots laughing about it.
[00:43:42.639 --> 00:43:43.299]  Former U.S.
[00:43:43.299 --> 00:44:05.104]  Army Specialists Josh Stiber and Ethan McCord now have publicly apologized for the massacre, expressing in an open letter to the Iraqi people their sorrow at the incident while pointing out that it represents just one example of the brutal suffering inflicted on the Iraqis since the March 2003 invasion.
[00:44:05.104 --> 00:44:09.645]  And separately, I have a article here
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:19.504]  Out of the Associated Press, where troops are serving two, three, four, five, and even six tours now.
[00:44:19.504 --> 00:44:24.226]  Some have served six tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:44:24.226 --> 00:44:30.109]  And when they collapse, they're having their medical benefits stripped, and they're being called cowards.
[00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:37.893]  Even though it turns out that a lot of them don't just have post-traumatic stress disorder, according to AP, they are having increased depression,
[00:44:39.016 --> 00:44:50.013]  And record suicide, no other war, because of an anti-malarial drug which has been pulled off the market for the general public because it causes suicidal tendencies and deep depression.
[00:44:51.010 --> 00:45:10.857]  So, and this one gentleman was there for two tours, back to back, on the anti-malarial drug, and finally saw an Iraqi family killed, and so he collapsed with post-traumatic stress, and so now, this is the army admitting this, they're branding him a coward retroactively, and taking his medical benefits.
[00:45:10.857 --> 00:45:11.958]  So, they give you a drug,
[00:45:15.558 --> 00:45:30.322]  I mean, I've talked to reporters who've been in Afghanistan, been in South America, been in other places where they've got to take the anti-malarial drug, and they talk about one week on it, collapsing and having hallucinations in their hotel rooms, wanting to kill themselves.
[00:45:30.322 --> 00:45:31.783]  You've heard some of them here on air.
[00:45:31.783 --> 00:45:39.845]  But they give it to the troops in combat, and then when they collapse, they blame them.
[00:45:39.845 --> 00:45:41.086]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:45:42.944 --> 00:45:46.047]  Once branded a coward, he fights for PTSD victims.
[00:45:46.047 --> 00:45:48.570]  AP, they call him the angry guy now.
[00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:54.616]  Even his friends at this moment on a snowy evening when he should be at home putting his son to bed.
[00:45:54.616 --> 00:45:57.539]  Andrew Pogany is in fact ticked off.
[00:45:57.539 --> 00:46:01.843]  He sits with a soldier in a law office.
[00:46:01.843 --> 00:46:05.487]  The man has brought him a pile of medical files and another
[00:46:06.789 --> 00:46:07.990]  Desperate story.
[00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.952]  Sent off to war to fight for this country.
[00:46:09.952 --> 00:46:12.453]  Diagnosed now with post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:46:12.453 --> 00:46:14.415]  Probably not even that, it's probably the drugs.
[00:46:14.415 --> 00:46:24.143]  Yet the army, the soldier tells Pogany, is drawing up papers to discharge him in a way that could mean no medical benefits and no Second Amendment.
[00:46:24.143 --> 00:46:26.865]  Dishonorable discharge.
[00:46:26.865 --> 00:46:32.970]  The soldier confides he thinks about killing himself all the time, he says.
[00:46:35.029 --> 00:46:46.143]  Better to be called angry than to be branded a coward by a very military he signed up to serve as the army did to him back in 2003.
[00:46:46.143 --> 00:46:50.889]  Then only a few days in country, Boggany saw a shredded body of a gunned down Iraqi.
[00:46:53.735 --> 00:46:56.499]  He had what he thought was a panic attack, vomiting, hallucinations.
[00:46:56.499 --> 00:47:01.967]  A psychologist concluded he had a normal combat stress reaction and recommended rest, then back to duty.
[00:47:01.967 --> 00:47:05.752]  Instead, Paganese commanders shipped him to Fort Carson.
[00:47:05.752 --> 00:47:09.998]  Of course, in all wars, people vomit, especially the first few times.
[00:47:09.998 --> 00:47:10.499]  That's normal.
[00:47:12.335 --> 00:47:25.046]  Instead, Pogany's commanders shipped him back to Fort Carson, and he was charged with cowardly conduct as a result of fear, a crime punishable by death under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
[00:47:25.046 --> 00:47:28.069]  The last such conviction in the Army occurred during the Vietnam War.
[00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:29.571]  Pogany wasn't convicted.
[00:47:29.571 --> 00:47:38.679]  He and his attorney produced findings that showed the breakdown was like a reaction to the anti-malaria drug larium, which has side effects that include paranoia and hallucinations.
[00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:42.343]  Says the Army dropped all the charges.
[00:47:42.343 --> 00:47:48.188]  But now... Now they're trying to pull his health care.
[00:47:48.188 --> 00:47:54.474]  And then it goes into other cases of people there for several tours this has happened to.
[00:47:54.474 --> 00:47:58.597]  But that's the type of information we deal with here every single day.
[00:47:58.597 --> 00:48:02.521]  You don't see Barack Obama and George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
[00:48:02.521 --> 00:48:04.703]  They all got out of military service.
[00:48:04.703 --> 00:48:05.864]  They all draft dodged.
[00:48:11.596 --> 00:48:20.640]  You don't see them over there being bitten by malaria-infested, diseased mosquitoes.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.781]  You don't see them knee-deep in the you-know-what.
[00:48:24.781 --> 00:48:26.162]  No.
[00:48:26.162 --> 00:48:34.245]  You see them prosecuting this fraudulent war on and on and on and on and on.
[00:48:34.245 --> 00:48:35.766]  Here's another article out of the Examiner.
[00:48:35.766 --> 00:48:38.667]  Obama repaying his masters at Goldman Sachs.
[00:48:40.293 --> 00:48:49.195]  And I agree with this analysis by Robert Stark at the LA Nonpartisan Examiner.
[00:48:49.195 --> 00:49:00.698]  I've read over the new financial reform bill and it's just more money and more regulatory power to the Goldman Sachs cronies that run the major regulatory agencies.
[00:49:00.698 --> 00:49:09.060]  President Obama is sponsoring a bill in the Senate Banking Committee, Chairman Chris Dodd, that would reward the financial firm Goldman Sachs with
[00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:13.232]  Billions of dollars.
[00:49:13.232 --> 00:49:28.542]  The bill implements a 50 billion resolution fund, the way it reads, it's wide open blank check, to the firm's creditors through fees that would come from banks and other businesses, which the bill calls the non-bank financial company.
[00:49:28.542 --> 00:49:38.389]  Critics are calling it a backdoor bailout to Goldman Sachs, who recently paid 12.9 billion in tax dollars through the bailout of AIG, and that was just in the US, it was billions in England too, in France.
[00:49:39.505 --> 00:49:53.781]  Supporters are denying the bill is a bailout because it demands the removal of some management positions, but Financial Crisis Inquiry Commissioner Member Peter Wallison said the act of paying off the creditors when the government takes over a failing firm is a bailout.
[00:49:53.781 --> 00:49:55.704]  It doesn't matter what the management
[00:49:56.204 --> 00:49:59.206]  Loses their jobs, and of course then there's always a loophole.
[00:49:59.206 --> 00:50:02.268]  That's what Dodd's last bill did in the stimulus package.
[00:50:02.268 --> 00:50:04.149]  Or that the shareholders get nothing.
[00:50:04.149 --> 00:50:12.754]  When the creditors are aware that they will get a better deal with the failure of a large company than they will get with a small one, that goes the ordinary route to bankruptcy.
[00:50:12.754 --> 00:50:15.435]  This is a bailout.
[00:50:15.435 --> 00:50:17.156]  And only select banks can get it.
[00:50:17.156 --> 00:50:19.257]  We cover this in the Obama deception.
[00:50:19.257 --> 00:50:21.559]  We show Dodd with his stimulus plan
[00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:25.438]  That had billions and billions more for the banks.
[00:50:25.438 --> 00:50:28.961]  And Obama pushed it like it was gonna go after CEOs and cap their pay.
[00:50:28.961 --> 00:50:39.732]  But what it did was retroactively allow all the big banks to continue what they did and to go further and forward with the deals they'd already signed that go in perpetuity.
[00:50:39.732 --> 00:50:41.094]  The way the Banker Bailout Bill was written.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:46.023]  And it selectively enforces only on the smaller banks.
[00:50:46.023 --> 00:50:47.725]  And then Dodd got in trouble for it.
[00:50:47.725 --> 00:50:50.288]  The media and Obama said, yeah, that's Dodd's fault.
[00:50:50.288 --> 00:50:55.232]  And then Dodd went public and said, well, here's the letter from Obama telling me to do this.
[00:50:55.232 --> 00:50:59.617]  So that's how duplicitous and deceptive Barack Obama, Barry Sitaro, is.
[00:51:01.568 --> 00:51:06.091]  Get incredible grip no matter what the conditions when you wear Maxfit gloves.

[00:52:00.729 --> 00:52:03.051]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:05.433]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.433 --> 00:52:08.635]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.635 --> 00:52:13.760]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:17.943]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.263 --> 00:52:20.606]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.606 --> 00:52:23.150]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:26.414]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.414 --> 00:52:34.004]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.344 --> 00:52:39.607]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.607 --> 00:52:42.589]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:46.271]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.271 --> 00:52:47.352]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.352 --> 00:52:48.673]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.673 --> 00:52:50.174]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.981 --> 00:53:09.504]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[00:53:09.504 --> 00:53:10.824]  My name is Crystal.
[00:53:10.824 --> 00:53:13.745]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:53:13.745 --> 00:53:17.706]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:53:17.706 --> 00:53:21.847]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:53:21.847 --> 00:53:22.687]  What did Crystal do?
[00:53:22.687 --> 00:53:25.108]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:53:26.628 --> 00:53:33.050]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:36.871]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:53:47.455 --> 00:53:48.075]  We're good.
[00:54:23.623 --> 00:54:29.328]  In other news, Chicago has been mafia-run for close to a hundred years.
[00:54:29.328 --> 00:54:31.910]  No one debates that.
[00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:35.273]  Great people up in Illinois, but boy, they have a criminal government.
[00:54:35.273 --> 00:54:38.716]  And Mayor Daley, the son of one of the most famous mob bosses in U.S.
[00:54:38.716 --> 00:54:42.519]  history, he, uh,
[00:54:43.854 --> 00:54:46.636]  Maybe looking in the future and not running again.
[00:54:46.636 --> 00:54:52.280]  He's mayor for life and bringing in the new mob boss, Mayor Emanuel.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.281]  Chicago Tribune interviewed him.
[00:54:54.281 --> 00:55:03.288]  Rahm Emanuel, Israeli Army officer, is I guess in the future to be the new mob boss.
[00:55:03.288 --> 00:55:08.851]  White House Chief of Staff says he'll like the post if Daley doesn't run for re-election.
[00:55:08.851 --> 00:55:10.813]  Isn't that great?
[00:55:10.813 --> 00:55:11.693]  The new Don.
[00:55:12.694 --> 00:55:14.794]  Don Emanuel.
[00:55:14.794 --> 00:55:16.235]  Don Daley.
[00:55:16.235 --> 00:55:18.835]  Don Carleone.
[00:55:18.835 --> 00:55:27.237]  But it's impossible to have Irish Mafia, or Jewish Mafia, or British Mafia, or WASP Mafia.
[00:55:27.237 --> 00:55:32.458]  Only Italian Mafia exists.
[00:55:32.458 --> 00:55:37.939]  Just like the FBI said until the mid-50s, La Cosa Nostra, the Mafia, does not exist.
[00:55:37.939 --> 00:55:39.739]  It is a conspiracy theory.
[00:55:39.739 --> 00:55:41.380]  I am a conspiracy theorist right now!
[00:55:42.719 --> 00:55:45.140]  Saying the Mafia even exist.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:47.421]  See, that shows you the denial.
[00:55:47.421 --> 00:55:58.824]  It's like people are denying our government has declassified that it's staged hundreds of terror attacks worldwide to blame it on enemies.
[00:55:58.824 --> 00:56:08.067]  Operation Gladio, the NATO option, Ajax, Tonkin, list goes on and on.
[00:56:08.067 --> 00:56:10.168]  It's the same naivete that we saw
[00:56:11.957 --> 00:56:27.143]  Back in the fifties, because they were blackmailing J. Edgar Hoover and he was getting large payoffs from La Cosa Nostra, he would get up before Congress in the forties and fifties and say, there is no mafia.
[00:56:27.143 --> 00:56:29.884]  There is no mafia.
[00:56:29.884 --> 00:56:37.567]  There is no mafia until state police in different parts of the country, who weren't on the payroll, busted the mafia.
[00:56:41.243 --> 00:56:49.188]  Years from now, it'll be that ridiculous if somebody gets up and says the government doesn't stage terror, it'll be like saying there is no mafia.
[00:56:49.188 --> 00:56:50.489]  There is no mafia!
[00:56:50.489 --> 00:56:51.850]  It's a conspiracy theory!
[00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:53.671]  The FBI says so!
[00:56:53.671 --> 00:56:55.512]  They said so 50 plus years ago.
[00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:58.474]  They don't say that now because they'd be laughed out of the room.
[00:56:58.474 --> 00:57:01.676]  It's time to grow up, folks.
[00:57:01.676 --> 00:57:03.417]  It's time to have a coming of age.
[00:57:03.417 --> 00:57:07.920]  There are FEMA camps, they are poisoning the water, it is a scientific dictatorship.
[00:57:09.699 --> 00:57:13.560]  And all of the questions are over.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:20.722]  All the rumors tomorrow, we release Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, PS4.
[00:57:20.722 --> 00:57:36.946]  Almost 8 years since I released a Police State film, 8 years of research, proving the FEMA camps with the congressional testimony, the documents, the photos, the videos, how it works, the different types of emergency centers, the executive orders, the continuity of government system, NORTHCOM, the troops,
[00:57:39.417 --> 00:57:46.723]  The Surveillance, The False Flag Terror, a two-hour, 20-plus minute film with over 30 minutes of extras on one DVD.
[00:57:46.723 --> 00:57:48.044]  You can pre-order the DVD now.
[00:57:48.044 --> 00:57:52.888]  It's already shipping out today, by the way, at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:52.888 --> 00:58:00.774]  Get your Police Date for The Rise of FEMA and it will premiere in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv tomorrow at 3 p.m.
[00:58:00.774 --> 00:58:01.975]  Central Standard Time.
[00:58:01.975 --> 00:58:06.499]  When this radio show ends, it will premiere tomorrow at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:10.202 --> 00:58:14.566]  Great job to the crew working on this film, producing it, getting it ready, and launching it.
[00:58:14.566 --> 00:58:16.488]  And we've had great success with...
[00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:19.495]  Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined.
[00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.895]  The DVDs are flying out.
[00:58:20.895 --> 00:58:22.556]  People are already making copies.

[00:59:53.852 --> 00:59:56.233]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.233 --> 01:00:05.517]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.517 --> 01:00:06.817]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.817 --> 01:00:08.598]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.598 --> 01:00:09.759]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.759 --> 01:00:11.219]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.219 --> 01:00:12.680]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.468 --> 01:00:17.673]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.673 --> 01:00:21.759]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.181 --> 01:00:37.444]  There is some good news around the country.
[01:00:37.444 --> 01:00:41.767]  Many states are on the verge of declaring 10th and 9th Amendment sovereignty.
[01:00:41.767 --> 01:00:45.050]  Many states are passing Vermont-style concealed carry.
[01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:47.212]  You can open carry, concealed carry.
[01:00:47.212 --> 01:00:49.514]  The Second Amendment is the Second Amendment.
[01:00:49.514 --> 01:00:52.837]  There were rallies all over the country in D.C., Virginia, you name it.
[01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:59.080]  With people engaged in open carry.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:04.185]  See, they have intimidated us into the closet like we're evil.
[01:01:04.185 --> 01:01:05.847]  Like we're doing something bad.
[01:01:05.847 --> 01:01:07.489]  Hiding with our guns.
[01:01:07.489 --> 01:01:14.717]  You know, neighbors that don't know you have a right to own guns routinely call the police on people because they see some guy taking his deer rifle out to his car in the parking lot.
[01:01:16.323 --> 01:01:22.566]  They have all these billboards up and TV ads saying report illegal guns and they show pictures of shotguns and rifles and handguns.
[01:01:22.566 --> 01:01:26.988]  So that dumbed down idiots that haven't ever been around the Second Amendment call the police on you.
[01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:32.911]  They have all these TV shows and dramas based in Chicago and New York.
[01:01:32.911 --> 01:01:39.073]  You know, these cop shows, where it shows people getting busted, both in fiction and non-fiction shows, for having firearms.
[01:01:39.073 --> 01:01:41.254]  That creates the perception guns are illegal.
[01:01:41.254 --> 01:01:49.876]  But by people all over the nation going to rallies and demonstrations with guns, they're not just doing this to show their guns off and try to intimidate the government.
[01:01:49.876 --> 01:01:54.397]  They're doing it to retake that liberty by the exercise of it, like your muscles.
[01:01:54.397 --> 01:01:56.298]  You don't exercise your muscles, they atrophy.
[01:01:57.355 --> 01:02:06.883]  And Arizona has now passed a law for concealed firearms without permit.
[01:02:06.883 --> 01:02:11.527]  And the media's ninnying and rubbing, oh my gosh, there'll be people with guns.
[01:02:11.527 --> 01:02:15.090]  What do you think criminals are already doing?
[01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:22.517]  Or the illegal aliens murdering ranchers and burning down whole neighborhoods and a huge military operation going on every day.
[01:02:22.517 --> 01:02:24.819]  But the media keeps quiet in Arizona and Texas.
[01:02:26.678 --> 01:02:31.047]  Arizona passes tough illegal immigration law, so they're taking action there.
[01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:37.119]  Arizona lawmakers passed a controversial immigration bill on Monday requiring police and the state
[01:02:38.123 --> 01:02:45.226]  That borders Mexico to determine if people are in the United States illegally, a measure critics say is open to racial profiling.
[01:02:45.226 --> 01:02:49.247]  You can profile citizens all day or pull you over for no reason or have a warrantless checkpoint.
[01:02:49.247 --> 01:02:50.368]  The feds love that.
[01:02:50.368 --> 01:02:52.949]  They fund police setting up warrantless checkpoints.
[01:02:52.949 --> 01:03:00.552]  They love decimating and burning holes in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[01:03:00.552 --> 01:03:01.372]  But when police
[01:03:02.978 --> 01:03:23.937]  There have been cases, the Justice Department's investigating, the Phoenix Sheriff and others, where they'll see a day labor site with 15 guys piling in a van or 8 guys piling in the back of a truck, they're clearly illegal aliens, and the cops pull over and say, let us see your IDs, and they arrest them, and the Feds are talking about trying to go after Arpaio and arrest him or something.
[01:03:23.937 --> 01:03:24.558]  Think about that!
[01:03:25.919 --> 01:03:29.622]  You can have warrantless illegal checkpoints for the American people.
[01:03:29.622 --> 01:03:44.513]  You know, at least Phoenix isn't like 800 plus other sanctuary cities like Austin, Texas, where cops have told me, and it's been in the news, they're told to release illegal aliens for drunk driving, no ID, no insurance, wrecks, you name it.
[01:03:44.513 --> 01:03:54.180]  And in one case, two days after they let an illegal go for drunk driving, after he'd hit a family, he ran into a cop drunk who was transporting a prisoner and almost killed him.
[01:03:58.479 --> 01:04:03.062]  I mean, hell, I could change my name and get a green card, or not even get a green card.
[01:04:03.062 --> 01:04:03.722]  It'd just be illegal.
[01:04:03.722 --> 01:04:11.327]  I could get a consular matricula, and then I could just drink gallons of tequila and just drive around however I want, run over people.
[01:04:11.327 --> 01:04:13.488]  I mean, you know, the new bar is your car.
[01:04:13.488 --> 01:04:18.271]  You just get in your car and pour yourself a vodka martini and drive by the cops waving at them.
[01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:20.152]  Hi, how you doing?
[01:04:20.152 --> 01:04:21.213]  You can't stop me.
[01:04:21.213 --> 01:04:22.194]  I'm the gingerbread man.
[01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:29.325]  The feds are such a sickening, disgusting joke.
[01:04:29.325 --> 01:04:32.988]  Coming up, Dr. Bob Bowman is joining us, former head of the Star Wars program.
[01:04:32.988 --> 01:04:34.749]  To get into that, it's going to be very informative.
[01:04:34.749 --> 01:04:37.651]  We'll also talk about the geopolitical setup of the planet.
[01:04:37.651 --> 01:04:39.332]  The latest on 9-11 truth.
[01:04:39.332 --> 01:04:42.394]  We've got a Oklahoma City bombing victim-survivor on.
[01:04:43.174 --> 01:04:45.875]  We're gonna look at propaganda claiming Bin Laden's still alive.
[01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:49.457]  Osama Bin Laden has a Facebook page, Fox News says.
[01:04:49.457 --> 01:04:54.159]  Next line says, the Al-Qaeda leader, or someone posing as him, is using the social network.
[01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:58.621]  I mean, you can go set up a Facebook and say you're Elvis, and then they'll put it on the news.
[01:04:58.621 --> 01:05:00.702]  Elvis is alive, he has a Facebook, look!
[01:05:00.702 --> 01:05:03.004]  They helped to create a new world order.
[01:05:03.004 --> 01:05:05.405]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:05:05.405 --> 01:05:07.886]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:05:08.606 --> 01:05:13.707]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:05:13.707 --> 01:05:18.228]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:05:18.228 --> 01:05:20.669]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:05:20.669 --> 01:05:23.129]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:05:23.129 --> 01:05:26.370]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:33.972]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:05:34.312 --> 01:05:39.696]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:05:39.696 --> 01:05:42.018]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:05:42.018 --> 01:05:46.241]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:47.322]  And I got news for you.
[01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:48.642]  You're everyone else.
[01:05:48.642 --> 01:05:50.164]  Invisible Empire.

[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.962]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:01.962 --> 01:06:07.548]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:06:07.548 --> 01:06:12.575]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:06:12.575 --> 01:06:17.621]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:23.366]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:06:23.366 --> 01:06:30.493]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:06:30.493 --> 01:06:31.614]  And here's the best part.
[01:06:31.614 --> 01:06:37.960]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.462]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:41.462 --> 01:06:43.704]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:06:43.704 --> 01:06:46.946]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.

[01:06:49.707 --> 01:06:57.332]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:06:57.332 --> 01:06:59.714]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:08.096]  Silver.com believes, as the Declaration of Independence states, that our rights come from God, not from government.
[01:07:08.096 --> 01:07:17.285]  The only lawful purpose of any government is to protect and secure the rights of the people, and no man or government has the authority to take what has been given to us by God.
[01:07:17.285 --> 01:07:20.508]  Among these rights are life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:25.870]  America's government has ceased to be the protector of liberty and of the people's God-given rights.
[01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:33.052]  But we the people can return America to greatness if we are willing to stand up and reassert our stolen rights.
[01:07:33.052 --> 01:07:37.033]  We ask that you join Utopia Silver in changing America's course in history.
[01:07:37.033 --> 01:07:41.795]  To save on health care and improve your health, call Utopia Silver at 888-213-4338.

[01:07:59.221 --> 01:08:06.804]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.804 --> 01:08:09.085]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:20.364 --> 01:08:36.152]  Coming up in a couple minutes, I'm going to play the new 8-minute sneak peek, call-to-action trailer.
[01:08:36.152 --> 01:08:45.637]  It's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:45.637 --> 01:08:48.419]  Because tomorrow, we are premiering
[01:08:49.639 --> 01:08:53.324]  Police state for the rise of FEMA.
[01:08:53.324 --> 01:08:57.229]  This is an eight minute video.
[01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:59.332]  Concentration camps in America.
[01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:05.200]  Alex Jones calls on all patriots to expose this growing evil.
[01:09:07.244 --> 01:09:17.948]  We're going to play the audio for the radio listeners and if you are a InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com visitor you can go up to the site and actually watch the video itself.
[01:09:17.948 --> 01:09:26.811]  Now this is a short sneak peek in the middle of it from just a minute and a half of the film but the rest of it is my call to action.
[01:09:26.811 --> 01:09:32.574]  The place and time that we are at today as a society.
[01:09:32.574 --> 01:09:33.414]  Then when we come back
[01:09:34.991 --> 01:09:44.318]  We're going to have Aaron Dixon Studio, who was arrested for asking Karl Rove a question last night, and it has hit the news.
[01:09:44.318 --> 01:09:48.302]  Then we will continue breaking down the fact that the federal government
[01:09:49.221 --> 01:09:58.147]  Is hyping domestic terror attacks and now saying domestic terror is as big a threat, or now bigger, than supposed Al Qaeda.
[01:09:58.147 --> 01:10:00.548]  A monumental shift out of the shadows.
[01:10:00.548 --> 01:10:03.250]  They were preparing this for the American people the whole time.
[01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.871]  It's designed for the American people.
[01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:06.512]  Their internal documents show that.
[01:10:06.512 --> 01:10:09.234]  Now they're out in the open saying, yes, you are the terrorist.
[01:10:09.234 --> 01:10:11.635]  Homeland Security is for you.
[01:10:11.635 --> 01:10:13.757]  The Patriot Act is for you.
[01:10:13.757 --> 01:10:15.558]  Brigade Homeland and NORTHCOM.
[01:10:17.779 --> 01:10:20.540]  This system is for you.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.562]  The Violent Belligerence Act is for you.
[01:10:23.562 --> 01:10:25.983]  It's all for you, the American people.
[01:10:25.983 --> 01:10:31.126]  And that's why Police State 4, the rise of FEMA is so important, because we break all of this down in the film.
[01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:39.891]  How this control grid is for you and your family, what makes up the control grid, who runs it, how they're staging false terror, the FEMA camps are documented.
[01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:43.793]  Here's a... Here's that information for everybody.
[01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:05.031]  Police states aren't a joke.
[01:11:05.031 --> 01:11:09.764]  Hundreds of millions of people have been killed by government in the last hundred years.
[01:11:11.687 --> 01:11:15.249]  The police state is about robbing you and your family.
[01:11:15.249 --> 01:11:25.695]  The police state is about setting up a control grid so that the system can literally render you down to the level of feudal serfs and slaves.
[01:11:25.695 --> 01:11:36.121]  But if the people can be awakened to this threat and can understand how they're being controlled and manipulated, we can defeat this system and restore our constitutional republic.
[01:11:36.821 --> 01:11:38.982]  We are not revolutionaries.
[01:11:38.982 --> 01:11:40.742]  We are restorationists.
[01:11:40.742 --> 01:11:46.304]  We want to restore the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and our Republic for which it stands.
[01:11:46.304 --> 01:11:58.669]  We want to defeat and overturn the global governance structure that is using false flag terror, staged events as a pretext to go after the American people.
[01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:04.651]  And the similar system is being used worldwide against populations.
[01:12:04.651 --> 01:12:09.432]  Each and every one of you watching today is an integral part.
[01:12:09.432 --> 01:12:21.376]  The actions and the decisions you make on whether you join this fight against the New World Order or whether you sit on your ass are absolutely vital to the future of this species.
[01:12:21.376 --> 01:12:22.577]  Individuals die.
[01:12:23.567 --> 01:12:26.269]  But our species goes on.
[01:12:26.269 --> 01:12:35.875]  And if you don't have an instinctive understanding of that, and if you're not threatened by the type of oppression that is unfolding in our society, you are asleep.
[01:12:35.875 --> 01:12:37.056]  You are blind.
[01:12:37.056 --> 01:12:43.360]  And I tell you now, this is the time to awaken to the New World Order.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:50.265]  What's happening today is real, and is a threat to every free-born person on this planet.
[01:12:50.845 --> 01:12:52.526]  Your water is being poisoned.
[01:12:52.526 --> 01:12:54.387]  Your food is being poisoned.
[01:12:54.387 --> 01:12:56.428]  Your air is being poisoned.
[01:12:56.428 --> 01:13:01.691]  A planetary dictatorial world government is openly being formed.
[01:13:01.691 --> 01:13:11.316]  And the goal of that world government is the establishment of a global kill grid to murder the majority of the world population.
[01:13:12.196 --> 01:13:14.538]  We know the government staging terror attacks.
[01:13:14.538 --> 01:13:15.999]  We have the Executive Orders.
[01:13:15.999 --> 01:13:18.621]  We have the John Warren Defense Authorization Act.
[01:13:18.621 --> 01:13:20.363]  We have REX 84.
[01:13:20.363 --> 01:13:22.384]  We have the Military Commissions Act.
[01:13:22.384 --> 01:13:26.127]  We have the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program documents.
[01:13:26.127 --> 01:13:34.694]  And Police State 4, the rise of FEMA, is a powerful salvo of truth against the mountain of lies that is the New World Order.
[01:13:35.234 --> 01:13:47.937]  All your friends and family that have heard about death camps, concentration camps, FEMA camps, who've been in denial, who've been lied to by the mainstream media, can watch this film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, and learn the truth.
[01:13:47.937 --> 01:13:49.498]  They can see the facts.
[01:13:49.498 --> 01:13:56.099]  They can check it for themselves and discover the truth.
[01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:57.900]  Good evening, my fellow Americans.
[01:13:58.996 --> 01:14:04.237]  We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of value proportion.
[01:14:04.237 --> 01:14:13.179]  We annually spend on military security alone, more than the net income of all United States corporations.
[01:14:13.179 --> 01:14:22.200]  We recognize the imperative need for this development, yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.741]  Our oil, resources, and livelihood are all involved.
[01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:30.897]  So is the very structure of our society.
[01:14:30.897 --> 01:14:42.427]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:14:42.427 --> 01:14:49.273]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.
[01:14:49.273 --> 01:14:54.277]  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic process.
[01:14:55.044 --> 01:14:57.280]  Only an alert and knowledgeable citizen.
[01:14:59.557 --> 01:15:16.528]  The proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense, the prospect of domination of the nation's profits by federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever-present, and is gravely to be regarded.
[01:15:16.528 --> 01:15:25.734]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the capital of a scientific
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:28.981]  Technological elite.
[01:15:28.981 --> 01:15:37.345]  We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.462]  We're at a crossroads in history.
[01:15:50.462 --> 01:15:52.344]  A crossroads in society.
[01:15:52.344 --> 01:15:54.767]  And now is the time to face the facts.
[01:15:54.767 --> 01:15:58.572]  Now is the time to be involved in history on the side of good.
[01:15:58.572 --> 01:16:03.158]  Now is the time to put our bodies against the machine of oppression.
[01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.339]  Don't stand idly by.
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.083]  Many of you feel like your life is meaningless.
[01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:08.344]  You have no purpose.
[01:16:08.344 --> 01:16:14.192]  That's because all you're doing is watching television and buying into the culture that teaches you to be insecure and feel weak.
[01:16:14.192 --> 01:16:16.274]  You are incredibly powerful.
[01:16:16.274 --> 01:16:19.979]  You are the species that's created jet aircraft and computers.
[01:16:19.979 --> 01:16:23.323]  You are the species that gave us Leonardo da Vinci.
[01:16:24.264 --> 01:16:27.647]  You are the species that is meant to go to the stars.
[01:16:27.647 --> 01:16:37.315]  But if we are to do that, we must recognize the enemy of free humanity, the New World Order, and we must bring this technocratic elite to justice.
[01:16:37.315 --> 01:16:50.647]  That's why I'm asking all of you to go to InfoWars.com and to get the info weapon, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, that ends the rumors and proves with documented fact that we are going headlong into a nightmare system.
[01:16:51.147 --> 01:16:55.069]  That's why I'm asking you to get the videos online and get them out to everyone you know.
[01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:59.852]  That's why I'm asking you now to commit and take action against the New World Order.
[01:16:59.852 --> 01:17:06.556]  Again, the destiny of humanity lies in your hands.
[01:17:06.556 --> 01:17:13.741]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, is only one step towards our victory against the New World Order.
[01:17:13.741 --> 01:17:15.422]  But it's a big step.
[01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:16.803]  And the destiny of this film
[01:17:17.697 --> 01:17:19.519]  And how many people are going to see it?
[01:17:19.519 --> 01:17:21.061]  Lies in your hands.
[01:17:21.061 --> 01:17:23.743]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:17:23.743 --> 01:17:25.185]  Buy blank DVDs.
[01:17:25.185 --> 01:17:26.746]  Make hundreds of copies.
[01:17:26.746 --> 01:17:29.189]  Give it to influential people in your area.
[01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:30.670]  Air on access television.
[01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:32.272]  Have viewing parties.
[01:17:32.272 --> 01:17:34.855]  Take the file from PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:17:34.855 --> 01:17:36.396]  Send it to your email list.
[01:17:36.396 --> 01:17:37.538]  Give it to everyone you know.
[01:17:38.078 --> 01:17:42.702]  We've already had dramatic success, and much of that credit belongs to you.
[01:17:42.702 --> 01:17:50.908]  So for all of you who've been in the info war over these years, who've been ridiculed, who've been laughed at, you've now been proven right.
[01:17:50.908 --> 01:17:53.250]  World government is now being openly announced.
[01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:57.554]  A world government to be run by the G20 and private banks.
[01:17:57.554 --> 01:17:59.235]  We're on the right side of history.
[01:17:59.235 --> 01:18:00.977]  We've told the truth.
[01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:04.539]  And we're standing up against evil, and we're letting the chips fall where they may.
[01:18:04.539 --> 01:18:06.941]  Because as a great philosopher once said,
[01:18:08.075 --> 01:18:09.436]  Justice be done.
[01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:15.042]  May the heavens fall.
[01:18:15.042 --> 01:18:17.084]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:18:17.084 --> 01:18:18.365]  It's here.
[01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:20.347]  Police states aren't a joke.
[01:18:20.347 --> 01:18:21.728]  They're not a game.
[01:18:21.728 --> 01:18:30.857]  They're a straitjacket designed so the establishment can rape and rob you and reduce you to absolute serfs and beggars.
[01:18:30.857 --> 01:18:31.938]  You're at a crossroads.
[01:18:32.699 --> 01:18:34.481]  You have a decision to make.
[01:18:34.481 --> 01:18:36.983]  There's no longer any time for denial.
[01:18:36.983 --> 01:18:38.904]  World government is real.
[01:18:38.904 --> 01:18:40.786]  The police state is real.
[01:18:40.786 --> 01:18:42.487]  The FEMA camps are real.
[01:18:42.487 --> 01:18:45.330]  And it's all covered in Police State 4.
[01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:47.011]  The rise of FEMA.
[01:18:47.011 --> 01:18:50.654]  This is a life and death situation.
[01:18:50.654 --> 01:18:54.957]  You have to have respect for yourselves and take action against this.
[01:18:54.957 --> 01:18:58.120]  Or be incrementally destroyed.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:58.901]  You have been warned.

[01:22:04.564 --> 01:22:09.970]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[01:22:09.970 --> 01:22:17.617]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion, the value of the U.S.
[01:22:17.617 --> 01:22:19.479]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.

[01:24:30.744 --> 01:24:33.347]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.TV in the next segment.

[01:24:43.442 --> 01:24:49.585]  Well, Germany, England, and other nations are now starting indictments against Goldman Sachs.
[01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:53.027]  There's been an indictment by the FCC here in the United States.
[01:24:53.027 --> 01:24:54.608]  This is opening them up for lawsuits.
[01:24:54.608 --> 01:24:56.029]  This is discrediting them.
[01:24:56.029 --> 01:24:57.870]  This is exposing the criminals.
[01:24:57.870 --> 01:25:02.012]  As we told you a year and a half ago, this was a premeditated implosion.
[01:25:02.012 --> 01:25:06.135]  Now, it's even in the London Guardian and major newspapers in the U.S.
[01:25:06.135 --> 01:25:08.276]  that it was by design.
[01:25:08.276 --> 01:25:11.197]  In fact, that's the headlines.
[01:25:11.197 --> 01:25:11.998]  Now, will we let
[01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:33.023]  These same groups panic the world deeper into the economic crisis they've created to establish an even bigger takeover via the cashless society global carbon tax slash VAT tax system that they are establishing.
[01:25:33.023 --> 01:25:37.106]  And this morning I just searched the term CO2 and clicked news.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:44.462]  And it was cities and counties and states all over the United States.
[01:25:44.462 --> 01:25:49.244]  Dallas, Austin, just where I live in Texas, just hundreds of articles.
[01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:53.825]  They're going ahead with the plan, doesn't matter if Copenhagen wasn't ratified, they don't care.
[01:25:53.825 --> 01:25:57.487]  Doesn't matter if they can't pass the bill in the Senate, they don't care.
[01:25:57.487 --> 01:26:06.450]  They're going in and carrying out mafia operations, protection rackets, going in to the coal plants,
[01:26:07.512 --> 01:26:14.818]  And making them put in all these different systems that is then passed on to you, the taxpayers.
[01:26:14.818 --> 01:26:17.620]  And the city of Austin, again, was set to vote on it last month.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.622]  They haven't done it yet.
[01:26:19.622 --> 01:26:24.746]  Austin Energy reported and said it was good, a $2.6 billion tax over the next three years.
[01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:26.648]  Just in three years, $2.6 billion.
[01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:31.191]  That's more than all the taxes Austinites pay in the aggregate over three years.
[01:26:31.191 --> 01:26:33.053]  Here's the Dallas Morning News.
[01:26:33.053 --> 01:26:34.154]  And I just printed a couple of these.
[01:26:34.154 --> 01:26:36.736]  I mean, there's no way to even read them all.
[01:26:37.591 --> 01:26:51.314]  But it's just all over the country, New Mexico, California, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Florida, West Virginia, you know, taxes on coal mines, taxes on power plants, taxes on factories, taxes, taxes, taxes.
[01:26:51.314 --> 01:27:03.116]  They want to kill the economy by design, as Gerald Salente has told you, as Max Kaiser has told you, as Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has told you, as Webster Tarpley has told you, and now we have their internal documents.
[01:27:04.482 --> 01:27:07.606]  They've shot up the country and now they want to put another bullet in our head.
[01:27:07.606 --> 01:27:12.252]  Agreement to trap CO2 wins green support for coal plant.
[01:27:12.252 --> 01:27:14.855]  Oh, you want to have a coal plant in Texas?
[01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:16.858]  We're not really building any of these.
[01:27:16.858 --> 01:27:19.381]  China's building, what, three, four a week on average?
[01:27:19.381 --> 01:27:20.662]  Was four last year.
[01:27:20.662 --> 01:27:22.525]  Saw another number of three a week.
[01:27:22.525 --> 01:27:23.386]  But we can't have them.
[01:27:24.787 --> 01:27:28.368]  Agreement to trap CO2 wins green support for coal plant.
[01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:32.249]  An agreement reached money between a major environmental group and a power company.
[01:27:32.249 --> 01:27:34.270]  See, the environmental group's a mafia.
[01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:36.730]  You have to go to them to be able to have a business.
[01:27:36.730 --> 01:27:42.092]  An agreement reached money between a major environmental group and a power company clears some of the opposition.
[01:27:42.972 --> 01:27:50.677]  To the new West Texas coal plant that promises to capture 85% of its carbon dioxide emissions and inject them into the ground.
[01:27:50.677 --> 01:27:51.858]  Give me a break.
[01:27:51.858 --> 01:27:52.979]  Plants breathe it.
[01:27:52.979 --> 01:27:56.762]  The earth is carbon dioxide starved right now, according to every study.
[01:27:56.762 --> 01:28:02.206]  And Nebraska-based Tenasca's plan comes through.
[01:28:02.206 --> 01:28:08.410]  Its new Trailblazer Energy Center near Sweetwater would be among the first commercial-scale coal plants in the U.S.
[01:28:08.410 --> 01:28:12.413]  to slash the CO2 reaching the atmosphere.
[01:28:14.133 --> 01:28:27.157]  In exchange for their pledge to cut CO2 and reduce potential water use, the Environmental Defense Fund agreed to withdraw from a Texas permit hearing that seeks to block the 600-megawatt plant.
[01:28:27.157 --> 01:28:35.540]  The Sierra Club, the project's other main opponent, is not part of the deal and remains in the hearing fighting the plant.
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:38.681]  And I've seen this in East Texas, where there's almost no jobs except for Walmart.
[01:28:39.471 --> 01:28:48.796]  And they try to build clean-powered plants, give people jobs that are very, very clean, and they just send in the local mafia and shut you down.
[01:28:48.796 --> 01:29:00.282]  I mean, they just come in, they file lawsuits, they threaten people, they go door-to-door, they brainwash the public, and they know, many of them know, that this is a mafia operation.
[01:29:00.282 --> 01:29:02.823]  Others are useful idiots.
[01:29:02.823 --> 01:29:03.684]  And they come in
[01:29:05.455 --> 01:29:05.735]  We're
[01:29:24.881 --> 01:29:26.422]  We're on the march.
[01:29:26.422 --> 01:29:27.143]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.311 --> 01:30:00.995]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:06.300]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:09.042]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:30:09.042 --> 01:30:14.386]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:30:14.386 --> 01:30:15.927]  Friends, I hope that you will order.

[01:31:08.044 --> 01:31:08.925]  Okay.

[01:32:01.411 --> 01:32:04.435]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:04.435 --> 01:32:09.761]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.761 --> 01:32:11.804]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.804 --> 01:32:16.810]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:17.992]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.992 --> 01:32:18.733]  When do you want it?
[01:32:19.113 --> 01:32:20.996]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.996 --> 01:32:22.057]  When will you need it?
[01:32:22.057 --> 01:32:24.280]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.602]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:25.602 --> 01:32:27.144]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:27.144 --> 01:32:32.411]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:32.411 --> 01:32:35.536]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.976 --> 01:32:39.797]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.797 --> 01:32:41.017]  How much will you need?
[01:32:41.017 --> 01:32:41.937]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.937 --> 01:32:43.038]  How much do you want?
[01:32:43.038 --> 01:32:43.958]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:45.058]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:45.058 --> 01:32:48.099]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:48.099 --> 01:32:50.959]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:50.959 --> 01:32:51.719]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:03.139]  Shut up and sit down!
[01:33:20.894 --> 01:33:23.237]  We're good to go.
[01:33:37.921 --> 01:33:38.442]  Oh, do it!
[01:33:38.442 --> 01:33:39.524]  Please do it!
[01:33:39.524 --> 01:33:40.486]  Please do it!
[01:33:40.486 --> 01:33:41.608]  I am not resisting!
[01:33:41.608 --> 01:33:42.870]  Stop resisting!
[01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:44.813]  I am not resisting!
[01:33:44.813 --> 01:33:46.837]  I'm not resisting what you're telling me.
[01:33:46.837 --> 01:33:47.859]  I work with this man, sir.
[01:33:47.859 --> 01:33:49.161]  I also work with this man.
[01:33:49.161 --> 01:33:49.261]  Okay.
[01:33:49.261 --> 01:33:51.124]  Alright, I'm with Austin Copwatch.
[01:33:52.412 --> 01:33:53.453]  This is Aaron Dykes.
[01:33:53.453 --> 01:34:04.562]  Sir, you need to let me in here.
[01:34:04.562 --> 01:34:07.644]  I'm with Austin Top Watch.
[01:34:07.644 --> 01:34:10.106]  Sir.
[01:34:10.106 --> 01:34:11.407]  We have an issue here, sir.
[01:34:12.219 --> 01:34:15.000]  I need to speak with a supervisor now.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.140]  Okay, so this is a First Amendment issue.
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:28.064]  Remember under Bush, they would have town hall meetings when they were open to the public, but they would make you sign a pledge not to ask mean questions or that you agreed with Bush or Cheney.
[01:34:28.064 --> 01:34:35.366]  They would also go into parking lots and find anti-war bumper stickers and follow people in and arrest them.
[01:34:35.366 --> 01:34:36.386]  That was all over the news.
[01:34:37.878 --> 01:34:51.240]  Now what happened is, they had said that Karl Rove was going to give a speech at UT last night to a packed ballroom of over 500 people that was open to the public and free, no stipulations, and that he was going to have a question and answer.
[01:34:52.358 --> 01:34:55.239]  And the same thing that happened to me back in 98 with Bush when he was governor.
[01:34:55.239 --> 01:34:56.440]  They said they were going to have a press conference.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.840]  The media was all there.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.681]  He gave a speech and they said no press conference.
[01:34:59.681 --> 01:35:05.223]  And at the end of his speech, I said, Governor, you know, isn't it the CFR, the New World Order, that's destroying America?
[01:35:05.223 --> 01:35:06.583]  Don't you want to fight that?
[01:35:06.583 --> 01:35:08.684]  And they had me basically kidnapped for an hour.
[01:35:08.684 --> 01:35:13.806]  They said I was arrested, drugged me out, put me in a car, drove me around.
[01:35:13.806 --> 01:35:16.607]  Now, they detained quite a few people.
[01:35:16.607 --> 01:35:17.647]  And no one disrupted.
[01:35:17.647 --> 01:35:18.368]  And Aaron was there.
[01:35:18.368 --> 01:35:19.528]  You can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:35:19.528 --> 01:35:21.249]  Aaron didn't get out of jail until about 4 this morning.
[01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:26.659]  And so his video hasn't been uploaded yet, but we have some of the other folks that were there and have uploaded it.
[01:35:26.659 --> 01:35:29.661]  We were able to grab the audio quickly when he just got into the office.
[01:35:29.661 --> 01:35:33.924]  It takes longer to upload the video, so we can play some of the audio, but we do have some video clips.
[01:35:33.924 --> 01:35:41.228]  We just played one of those, and there's different angles that are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but the issue here is
[01:35:43.467 --> 01:35:44.887]  Aaron was quiet throughout the whole speech.
[01:35:44.887 --> 01:35:46.948]  He said thank you, and he was done.
[01:35:46.948 --> 01:35:53.550]  And before he said that, he said, you know, we weren't going to take questions, but I've got some prepared written on cue cards.
[01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:55.190]  Lord knows where they came from.
[01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:56.891]  Probably fake questions.
[01:35:56.891 --> 01:36:00.972]  So they said no questions, and they said, well, I'm going to answer some questions on cue cards.
[01:36:00.972 --> 01:36:02.132]  But they hadn't handed these out.
[01:36:02.132 --> 01:36:02.993]  This hadn't been public.
[01:36:05.032 --> 01:36:19.844]  Aaron, after he says thank you, and is about to be asked questions off cue cards, Aaron brings up some important issues about the Downing Street memo, White House memo, that are declassified the last four years and publicly admit that the White House premeditatedly lied about WMDs.
[01:36:19.844 --> 01:36:23.547]  They weren't wrong, they didn't get it wrong, they knew they were lying.
[01:36:23.547 --> 01:36:27.170]  They even talked about, in the White House memo, shooting down a U.S.
[01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:29.152]  aircraft or getting it shot down or a U.N.
[01:36:29.152 --> 01:36:30.473]  aircraft to blame it on Saddam.
[01:36:31.013 --> 01:36:33.094]  That's the Times of London Associated Press.
[01:36:33.094 --> 01:36:35.416]  But the general public doesn't know this.
[01:36:35.416 --> 01:36:38.157]  It never became a big nightly news item.
[01:36:38.157 --> 01:36:42.640]  And so Aaron went down there, Rob Doo went down there, Rob Jacobson went down there.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.682]  I've been doing radio, TV interviews, and quite frankly, after four hours every day, that's why I don't go to many of these events.
[01:36:46.682 --> 01:36:48.463]  I'm just exhausted.
[01:36:48.463 --> 01:36:49.584]  But the guys wanted to go.
[01:36:49.584 --> 01:36:50.324]  I didn't say go.
[01:36:50.324 --> 01:36:50.945]  I said, do you want to go?
[01:36:50.945 --> 01:36:51.965]  And they said, yes.
[01:36:51.965 --> 01:36:54.146]  I said, don't get arrested.
[01:36:54.146 --> 01:36:56.588]  But then they came up and grabbed Aaron.
[01:36:58.024 --> 01:36:59.745]  Yeah, it's right over there, so...
[01:37:21.578 --> 01:37:23.401]  The way they have it set up, I'm not sure.
[01:37:23.401 --> 01:37:25.004]  Oh, so we can do both?
[01:37:25.004 --> 01:37:31.474]  I mean, see, the problem is I'm all doing the live radio show, so we're just having a debate about this right now, because you guys had said we had the audio up, so we can play the video too.
[01:37:31.474 --> 01:37:32.997]  Do we have it cued up to the point?
[01:37:36.254 --> 01:37:37.014]  I'm going to cover news.
[01:37:37.014 --> 01:37:42.656]  Go out and have a meeting with them about that, because I want to find out exactly what we're going to do, and then we'll find out.
[01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:53.220]  And we'll get Aaron's story here in just a moment, but it's better to just play it live since we're at PrisonPlanet.tv than wait until Aaron goes and takes a nap and then does it.
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:38:00.083]  But InfoWars journalist arrested, hailed for asking Karl Rove a question during UT appearance.
[01:38:02.523 --> 01:38:10.030]  And it says Aaron waited until it was question time, and rather than sit through the pre-selected controlled media questions, Aaron wanted to know about the Downing Street Memo.
[01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:16.555]  And so, Rob Jacobson stood up and shouted in agreement with Aaron.
[01:38:16.555 --> 01:38:17.896]  They then separately grabbed him.
[01:38:17.896 --> 01:38:18.877]  They were going to arrest him.
[01:38:18.877 --> 01:38:25.163]  So Aaron was in the University of Texas detainment area, in the offices with the police.
[01:38:26.804 --> 01:38:31.189]  I talked to him after he got out, and they were coming over to Aaron saying, we're going to charge you with resisting.
[01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:33.931]  So that's why it's in our article that they were going to charge him with resisting.
[01:38:33.931 --> 01:38:39.637]  They ended up charging him with something else, because Aaron pointed out, this is all on video, you're not going to get away with this.
[01:38:39.637 --> 01:38:48.847]  And so Aaron, we're going to play this video, unedited, for the first time, I haven't even seen this, from your camera, what happened, but break down what happened last night.
[01:38:50.043 --> 01:39:13.355]  Karl Rove is such a pernicious liar and manipulator of public truth and he just staged the whole thing making comments about how this is his free speech and not the liberals and then only after someone interrupts does he finally say yes there will be questions after they said there will be none but he says they will be from pre-written cards that are only for Democrats or Republicans and you line up
[01:39:14.435 --> 01:39:17.017]  And my question didn't fit into the category.
[01:39:17.017 --> 01:39:17.897]  I'm not a Republican.
[01:39:17.897 --> 01:39:19.178]  I'm not a Democrat.
[01:39:19.178 --> 01:39:22.760]  And so the free speech was a fraud.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:25.282]  They announced that they would be warning people for disrupting.
[01:39:25.282 --> 01:39:30.205]  They acknowledged that there were disruptors because there was Code Pink and other groups spread throughout the thing.
[01:39:32.387 --> 01:39:35.089]  I was persecuted for reasons I don't fully understand.
[01:39:35.089 --> 01:39:39.091]  As soon as I outburst, they grabbed me by the elbow without warning.
[01:39:39.091 --> 01:39:40.912]  They were there in like five seconds!
[01:39:40.912 --> 01:39:51.559]  Yeah, they were surrounding me, and as soon as they got the chance, they grabbed me by the elbow, jerked me back, and I heard the cops saying, stop resisting arrest.
[01:39:51.559 --> 01:39:52.680]  Is he resisting arrest?
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.281]  He's not resisting arrest.
[01:39:54.281 --> 01:39:58.163]  And so I had to defend myself out in the public and say, no, I'm not resisting arrest.
[01:39:58.163 --> 01:39:59.224]  I'm not resisting arrest.
[01:39:59.844 --> 01:40:01.005]  And the rest is on video.
[01:40:01.005 --> 01:40:05.869]  They dragged me back, and I was simply trying to ask Karl Rove a question, which I continued to do.
[01:40:10.862 --> 01:40:13.003]  You know, getting you guys out of jail at what, about four in the morning?
[01:40:13.003 --> 01:40:16.325]  And there was another fella from We Are Change that we bailed out.
[01:40:16.325 --> 01:40:21.907]  But here it is out of News 8 Austin yesterday morning before Karl Rove spoke.
[01:40:21.907 --> 01:40:26.950]  And it says, former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove will give a lecture at the University of Texas Monday.
[01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:31.492]  Rove is expected to talk about his time at the White House as former President Bush's top political advisor.
[01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:32.593]  Rove will also share his
[01:40:33.533 --> 01:40:40.038]  Analysis of key issues the nation faces currently including health care, the economy, and protection of individual liberties.
[01:40:40.038 --> 01:40:47.244]  And I have a separate article about the George W. Bush Center in Dallas calling for defending internet freedom and having a big conference yesterday.
[01:40:47.244 --> 01:40:48.805]  So they are now the freedom fighters.
[01:40:49.105 --> 01:40:58.008]  They passed the Patriot Act, they write White House memos about torturing children in front of their parents, burying people alive, killing them, raping them is good.
[01:40:58.008 --> 01:41:01.230]  They start cyber security that lets the feds take over the web.
[01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:02.510]  Obama's continuing that.
[01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:04.191]  Everyone agrees it's draconian.
[01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:07.392]  I mean, even CNET News calls it the end of the free internet.
[01:41:07.392 --> 01:41:09.633]  They're the ones that engineered this.
[01:41:09.633 --> 01:41:14.255]  Obama's taken the baton in this relay race, and then he's at UT, according to this,
[01:41:15.575 --> 01:41:19.676]  Doing a national tour about freedom of speech, and then here they are doing this to you.
[01:41:19.676 --> 01:41:22.156]  I haven't had a chance to see his speech yet.
[01:41:22.156 --> 01:41:24.297]  I mean, did he talk about freedom of speech?
[01:41:24.297 --> 01:41:28.317]  Oh yeah, and he makes jokes about it and talks about how he's never allowed to speak.
[01:41:28.317 --> 01:41:35.459]  He's the one with the microphone, knowing that there's no microphone set up for audience questions and he's not really interacting with the audience.
[01:41:35.459 --> 01:41:38.719]  There is no free speech if you don't like Karl Rove at an event.
[01:41:38.719 --> 01:41:40.439]  He can hold a sign, he doesn't care.
[01:41:40.439 --> 01:41:43.480]  He's been confronted over and over, at least a dozen times that I've seen.
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:44.741]  He seems to enjoy it.
[01:41:44.741 --> 01:41:45.522]  He laughs at them.
[01:41:45.522 --> 01:41:49.285]  He sticks his face in the window and makes, you know, piggy faces.
[01:41:49.285 --> 01:41:50.285]  And he's disgusting.
[01:41:50.285 --> 01:41:51.266]  He's a war criminal.
[01:41:51.266 --> 01:41:55.650]  The blood is on his hands, but he's frankly not in touch with that.
[01:41:55.650 --> 01:41:57.632]  But that's not going to keep us from resisting that.
[01:41:57.632 --> 01:41:58.512]  Well, he got caught.
[01:41:58.512 --> 01:42:05.818]  It's now admitted they had to release him, setting up the Alabama governor, just lying and having an ex-con lie and put him in jail.
[01:42:05.818 --> 01:42:07.279]  And it turned out he made all the orders.
[01:42:07.279 --> 01:42:09.021]  I mean, this is a hardcore evil person.
[01:42:09.141 --> 01:42:10.101]  Well, it's a total joke.
[01:42:10.101 --> 01:42:15.484]  They did nothing but shred the Constitution, and now that Obama's in power, they'll make issue of freedom of speech.
[01:42:15.484 --> 01:42:22.247]  Well, they're gonna ride back to power, because, I mean, he was the guy that brought Rick Perry up in to politics, and George Bush.
[01:42:22.247 --> 01:42:27.229]  I mean, he was the kingmaker for both, and he's the one telling Perry to say, Texas will secede!
[01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:28.610]  We're fighting the New World Order!
[01:42:28.610 --> 01:42:30.431]  Now I gotta go to the Bilderberg Group in ten minutes.
[01:42:31.058 --> 01:42:41.304]  Yeah, I mean, Rove tracks back to so much Dirty Laundry, but the bottom line point is he didn't allow anyone to speak and it's just a travesty, really.
[01:42:41.304 --> 01:42:45.506]  Now, when I talked to Aaron after they'd arrested... I mean, when I talked to...
[01:42:46.829 --> 01:42:58.574]  Rob Jacobson, after they'd arrested you, they were saying they were going to charge you, he said, when you were in the cell with him before they moved you to the Travis County Jail, that they were going to charge you with resisting?
[01:42:58.574 --> 01:42:58.935]  Yeah.
[01:42:58.935 --> 01:43:05.077]  In fact, I overheard some of the cops talking about how the other people wouldn't be charged, they would be sent home, but not this one.
[01:43:05.077 --> 01:43:10.320]  And I didn't really catch on what their specific reasons were, but they clearly signaled me out in the filing room.
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:11.461]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:34.369 --> 01:43:35.230]  Oh, you remember it now?
[01:43:35.230 --> 01:43:35.790]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:38.453]  His name is Jeff Owens, so I got to know him.
[01:43:38.453 --> 01:43:45.499]  He's actually a war veteran, and he said he was there to speak out against civil rights, and he wasn't concerned about getting arrested.
[01:43:45.499 --> 01:43:48.602]  Oh, I wasn't clear, because right before we went live, you said, I need to run out and check his name.
[01:43:48.602 --> 01:43:49.963]  I've forgotten, so it just popped in your head.
[01:43:49.963 --> 01:43:53.326]  I did forget his name a couple times last night, because... Okay, I was trying to be clear.
[01:43:53.326 --> 01:43:54.507]  So, I mean, tell us about what happened to him.
[01:43:54.827 --> 01:44:02.073]  It's a long night in jail and there's so many confusing questions and all kinds of rigmarole and like they ask these framing questions.
[01:44:02.073 --> 01:44:03.715]  Are you going to commit suicide?
[01:44:03.715 --> 01:44:07.338]  And all kinds of questions with strange edges to him.
[01:44:07.338 --> 01:44:09.399]  But he had a very same processing as me.
[01:44:09.399 --> 01:44:14.364]  He had the same charge, the same bond fee, and he was in the cell right next to me.
[01:44:14.364 --> 01:44:15.865]  And you've been charged with?
[01:44:15.865 --> 01:44:19.308]  I've been charged with disrupting a public event, I believe.
[01:44:19.887 --> 01:44:23.370]  Alright, let's go ahead and start rolling this video.
[01:44:23.370 --> 01:44:24.912]  This is from last night.
[01:44:24.912 --> 01:44:25.893]  I haven't even seen this.
[01:44:25.893 --> 01:44:27.575]  Aaron hasn't even really seen this.
[01:44:27.575 --> 01:44:29.677]  We just loaded it into the computer.
[01:44:29.677 --> 01:44:38.005]  We shot these on small flip phones, or flip cameras, keep calling them flip phones, because those were easy to sneak in because they were saying no filming, right?
[01:44:38.522 --> 01:44:40.264]  Yeah, I mean, they're totally draconian.
[01:44:40.264 --> 01:44:45.248]  And this is one of those things put by the Republican Party, they snicker at everyone who's in opposition.
[01:44:45.248 --> 01:44:49.832]  But this is at a state university, supposedly open to the public, but you don't bring your video cameras.
[01:44:49.832 --> 01:44:52.314]  It's open, but they control every parameter.
[01:44:52.314 --> 01:44:55.216]  And if you speak out, you're arrested and dragged out.
[01:44:55.216 --> 01:44:59.160]  And Karl Rove lied, Rove lied and said you'll be warned three times.
[01:45:00.165 --> 01:45:01.966]  Yeah, well, they made a point.
[01:45:01.966 --> 01:45:06.107]  They acknowledged there will be disruptors and there's various viewpoints.
[01:45:06.107 --> 01:45:10.709]  And so the police came up and they announced they would warn people three times, then arrest them.
[01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:20.492]  And then when someone does disrupt, they have a speaker to stand up for rope and say, we ask that you stop speaking just so they can talk over him, you see, so that their question can't be heard.
[01:45:20.979 --> 01:45:26.281]  And so Karl Rove takes a break and they say, we ask that you stop speaking, you'll be removed from the university.
[01:45:26.281 --> 01:45:30.243]  I've seen this at the Petraeus speeches and other Rove speeches.
[01:45:30.243 --> 01:45:31.604]  It's really a control tactic.
[01:45:31.604 --> 01:45:36.566]  And let's be clear, he was done with his speech and they were saying, we're now going to go to these cue cards.
[01:45:36.806 --> 01:45:40.707]  Yeah, I mean, his speech was so boring I didn't think it would be worthwhile to interrupt it.
[01:45:40.707 --> 01:45:44.648]  The only reason I did interrupt at all is because there was no free speech.
[01:45:44.648 --> 01:45:48.569]  You had to be a pre-written cue card Republican or Democrat, I'm not that.
[01:45:48.569 --> 01:45:57.632]  But yes, I waited until he said, thank you, indicating the end of his speech after he wrapped it up and said, you know, Obama's not so bad after all since he continues that war.
[01:45:57.632 --> 01:45:58.392]  Those wars, rather.
[01:45:59.062 --> 01:46:00.203]  Really?
[01:46:00.203 --> 01:46:01.924]  Oh yeah, he gives Obama credit.
[01:46:01.924 --> 01:46:06.347]  He says, you can see, even though it's not what he campaigned on, it's reflected in the polls.
[01:46:06.347 --> 01:46:09.449]  People love that he's continuing the war, basically is the essence of it.
[01:46:09.449 --> 01:46:11.951]  Yeah, he has the lowest approval rating of any president in a year and a half in.
[01:46:11.951 --> 01:46:13.892]  As long as he continues the war, he's not so bad.
[01:46:13.892 --> 01:46:16.874]  I mean, Karl Rove is such a duplicitous liar.
[01:46:16.874 --> 01:46:17.934]  Let's go ahead and go to this video.
[01:46:17.934 --> 01:46:18.275]  Here it is.
[01:46:26.869 --> 01:46:32.175]  You talk about free speech, but I'm not a Democrat or a Republican!
[01:46:32.175 --> 01:46:33.957]  Take my question!
[01:46:47.897 --> 01:46:50.579]  I am not resisting.
[01:46:50.579 --> 01:46:53.181]  I am not resisting.
[01:46:53.181 --> 01:46:54.061]  I am not resisting.
[01:47:20.818 --> 01:47:22.099]  I am not resisting.
[01:47:22.099 --> 01:47:26.260]  If you want me to leave the building, that is fine.
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:31.042]  I'm more than happy to leave the building.
[01:47:31.042 --> 01:47:36.263]  I'm not resisting arrest.
[01:47:36.263 --> 01:47:37.724]  Sir, I have a right to free speech.
[01:47:37.724 --> 01:47:39.405]  You have no reason to arrest me.
[01:47:39.405 --> 01:47:40.785]  Why am I being arrested?
[01:47:40.785 --> 01:47:41.705]  What is the reason?
[01:47:41.705 --> 01:47:44.386]  You're going to read my Miranda rights.
[01:47:52.637 --> 01:47:59.541]  How long did this go till they turn the camera off?
[01:47:59.541 --> 01:48:02.042]  Once they did the initial handcuffing.
[01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:03.803]  Keep rolling here.
[01:48:03.803 --> 01:48:04.643]  Going into the dungeon.
[01:48:04.643 --> 01:48:14.548]  I'm not going to like it if I sue you personally for violating my rights of free speech.
[01:48:14.548 --> 01:48:16.149]  Here's all the other criminals.
[01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:17.710]  I think that was Jacobson for one second.
[01:48:18.641 --> 01:48:20.582]  Oh, so that's when it got turned off.
[01:48:20.582 --> 01:48:21.263]  I guess so, yeah.
[01:48:21.263 --> 01:48:22.164]  They grabbed it away from you?
[01:48:22.164 --> 01:48:28.568]  They took it from me when they put me in cuffs, so... And there's Rob in there!
[01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:29.529]  Oh man, I tell ya!
[01:48:31.141 --> 01:48:34.564]  I mean, they were silencing free speech very skillfully.
[01:48:34.564 --> 01:48:35.465]  Roe was skillful.
[01:48:35.465 --> 01:48:37.647]  I mean, I wish I could come off articulately.
[01:48:37.647 --> 01:48:39.408]  He knows how to handle all these questions.
[01:48:39.408 --> 01:48:41.610]  He's an old Watergate dirty trickster.
[01:48:41.610 --> 01:48:44.733]  That's when he... And he tripled the size of government.
[01:48:44.733 --> 01:48:46.695]  He supported the assault weapons ban.
[01:48:46.695 --> 01:48:49.057]  He got Bush to support carbon taxes.
[01:48:49.617 --> 01:48:51.738]  And the Republicans are just a bunch of idiots.
[01:48:51.738 --> 01:48:53.399]  They wonder why they're losing their country.
[01:48:53.399 --> 01:48:54.780]  They wonder why everything's falling apart.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:49:03.225]  They go in there, these milquetoast, weak-looking people, and just look up at him like a dog looks at its master, just lovingly.
[01:49:03.225 --> 01:49:04.406]  Oh, we love you, Rove.
[01:49:04.406 --> 01:49:05.927]  We love criminality.
[01:49:05.927 --> 01:49:06.707]  We love it all.
[01:49:06.707 --> 01:49:08.368]  We love Bohemian Grove.
[01:49:08.368 --> 01:49:10.269]  We love the gay orgies.
[01:49:10.269 --> 01:49:11.150]  It's conservative.
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:12.480]  It's sick.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:21.184]  It's not our everyday point, but the way they control politics on college campuses, you know, is the embryo of the weak party system we have today that makes things so bad.
[01:49:21.184 --> 01:49:27.066]  Well, Karl Rove, you know, he likes all those midnight visits that came out in the news.
[01:49:27.066 --> 01:49:29.267]  You know, that's neither here nor there, I guess.
[01:49:29.267 --> 01:49:31.488]  It's all just a big... but he's conservative, though.
[01:49:31.488 --> 01:49:33.289]  That's good.
[01:49:33.289 --> 01:49:37.371]  And, you know, it's good that Newt Gingrich is supporting carbon taxes.
[01:49:37.371 --> 01:49:38.871]  You're some kind of commie.
[01:49:38.871 --> 01:49:40.152]  You're against taxes, boy.
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:42.441]  It's sick.
[01:49:42.441 --> 01:49:46.144]  I mean, we know how the Constitution should put us, but we're not there.
[01:49:46.144 --> 01:49:48.947]  Anything else, Aaron, you'd like to add about this fiasco?
[01:49:48.947 --> 01:49:49.788]  It was a long night.
[01:49:49.788 --> 01:49:51.069]  I'm glad it's over.
[01:49:51.069 --> 01:49:54.512]  I really didn't want to get arrested, but sometimes it has to be done.
[01:49:54.512 --> 01:50:03.220]  Well, I mean, in the old days, I guess I've got to start going to these, I would get up and, you know, ask questions of Reno and other people and Barry McCaffrey and others, and they didn't arrest me.
[01:50:04.517 --> 01:50:05.858]  I'll say one thing about Rove.
[01:50:05.858 --> 01:50:09.641]  I've been through a lot of hairy confrontations working for you over the years.
[01:50:09.641 --> 01:50:13.964]  This is the first time I've been arrested formally in cuffs with charges.
[01:50:13.964 --> 01:50:16.086]  Bilderberg would be the second.
[01:50:16.086 --> 01:50:23.631]  And you've had armed security guards of the Federal Reserve a half mile away come to a city park and tell you to turn a camera off or they're going to arrest you for handling their guns.
[01:50:23.631 --> 01:50:26.573]  Oh yeah, we've been through some adventures.
[01:50:26.573 --> 01:50:27.634]  That's the world out there.
[01:50:27.634 --> 01:50:28.935]  Someone has to stand up, Alex.
[01:50:30.464 --> 01:50:34.206]  We weren't born to be in some prostrate position.
[01:50:34.206 --> 01:50:36.347]  At some point, someone has to stand up.
[01:50:36.347 --> 01:50:38.269]  I wish it was someone more articulate than me.
[01:50:38.269 --> 01:50:43.111]  But I thought you worked for a right-wing pro-war guy, the liberal media says.
[01:50:43.111 --> 01:50:47.474]  But we're out asking questions against the war, which the Democrats don't do anymore.
[01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:51.616]  You notice now, it's their war, and they like it, and they like the torture, and they've just shut up.
[01:50:51.616 --> 01:50:52.877]  Aaron Dykes, good job.
[01:50:52.877 --> 01:50:53.978]  Go home and get some sleep, buddy.
[01:50:53.978 --> 01:50:54.478]  Thanks, man.
[01:50:54.478 --> 01:50:55.018]  Great job.
[01:50:55.018 --> 01:50:59.061]  All right, we'll be back with more news, and we've got Dr. Bob Bowman coming up.
[01:50:59.061 --> 01:50:59.461]  Stay with us.

[01:51:05.899 --> 01:51:06.420]  Fact.
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:10.101]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[01:51:10.101 --> 01:51:10.721]  Fact.
[01:51:10.721 --> 01:51:16.223]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[01:51:16.223 --> 01:51:16.863]  Fact.
[01:51:16.863 --> 01:51:21.065]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.

[01:53:01.649 --> 01:53:02.930]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:08.515]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:08.515 --> 01:53:13.539]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:13.539 --> 01:53:14.019]  It's true.
[01:53:14.019 --> 01:53:16.842]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:53:16.842 --> 01:53:18.563]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:19.105 --> 01:53:24.326]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:24.326 --> 01:53:26.627]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:53:26.627 --> 01:53:31.427]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:31.427 --> 01:53:32.548]  And here's the best part.
[01:53:32.548 --> 01:53:35.328]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:53:35.328 --> 01:53:39.249]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:39.249 --> 01:53:42.430]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:44.650]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:53:44.650 --> 01:53:45.590]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:49.231 --> 01:53:52.193]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:52.193 --> 01:53:58.296]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:58.296 --> 01:54:03.318]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeaBank.com.
[01:54:03.318 --> 01:54:09.081]  Barter unions are big businessmen, and they're going out like dinosaurs.
[01:54:09.081 --> 01:54:12.663]  Barter used to grow food in Kansas,
[01:54:26.518 --> 01:54:29.019]  It's sundown on the Union.
[01:54:29.019 --> 01:54:40.201]  Dr. Bob Bowman is coming up inside the Secret of Star Wars program.
[01:54:40.201 --> 01:54:45.982]  As much as he can tell us legally and lawfully, we'll talk about a host of other issues with him as well.
[01:54:45.982 --> 01:54:53.403]  We've got an Oklahoma City bombing survivor who's saying it's an inside job joining us in the last 30 minutes of the transmission.
[01:54:56.032 --> 01:54:57.856]  You better get that through your head.
[01:54:57.856 --> 01:55:01.845]  This world is ruled by violence.
[01:55:01.845 --> 01:55:03.910]  We need to start being honest about that.
[01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:06.931]  I wanted to say one other thing about this.
[01:55:06.931 --> 01:55:10.753]  I mean, I guess I was arrested for asking Bush a question in a press conference.
[01:55:10.753 --> 01:55:12.154]  But this has now happened to Aaron.
[01:55:12.154 --> 01:55:13.735]  It's happening to more and more people.
[01:55:13.735 --> 01:55:20.899]  And that's why they've hired provocateurs to dress up as anarchists since Seattle in 99 to attack police and others.
[01:55:20.899 --> 01:55:33.007]  And it's come out in every case it was staged to then scare other Americans from going out and demonstrating because you're met by police in riot gear beating their shields and firing tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets at you.
[01:55:34.585 --> 01:55:41.150]  Famous video in Miami of peaceful people with signs being shot with rubber bullets and going through the sign and blooding their face.
[01:55:41.150 --> 01:55:45.613]  And then the cops after the event videotaping their after action.
[01:55:45.613 --> 01:55:48.896]  Hey, did you see how funny it was when we shot to that sign and shot that lady in the face?
[01:55:48.896 --> 01:55:53.619]  It's going to be very funny, cops, when the bankers take your pension fund, too.
[01:55:53.619 --> 01:55:55.340]  You think you're a big shark?
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:56.681]  You think you're the big fish on the block?
[01:55:56.681 --> 01:55:58.403]  You think your bosses care about you?
[01:55:58.403 --> 01:56:03.827]  When they're done with you, they'll flush you down the toilet, just like they're flushing this republic down the toilet.
[01:56:05.216 --> 01:56:09.178]  But I want to thank everyone that called the jail.
[01:56:09.178 --> 01:56:16.701]  When we got down there to the jail last night, they said it'll be 24 hours until he even sees a judge.
[01:56:16.701 --> 01:56:18.762]  This is like at 10 o'clock at night.
[01:56:18.762 --> 01:56:26.305]  And then they got a bunch of phone calls down there, and they did tell Aaron they got phone calls, so the We Are Change fellow and Aaron were released.
[01:56:27.148 --> 01:56:28.989]  They were released.
[01:56:28.989 --> 01:56:30.789]  And so that's good news.
[01:56:30.789 --> 01:56:31.790]  One other tidbit here.
[01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:35.791]  We are premiering Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA tomorrow at 3 p.m.
[01:56:35.791 --> 01:56:38.452]  Central when the radio show ends.
[01:56:38.452 --> 01:56:40.453]  At PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:40.453 --> 01:56:42.273]  And the DVDs are shipping today.
[01:56:42.273 --> 01:56:43.654]  They were shipping yesterday.
[01:56:43.654 --> 01:56:46.635]  Most of you will get them today, tomorrow, or the next day.
[01:56:46.635 --> 01:56:47.555]  Who ordered them?
[01:56:47.555 --> 01:56:49.556]  The high quality DVD with the expanded extras.
[01:56:50.563 --> 01:57:00.727]  I want to thank all of you that are supporting us, but more importantly, have viewing parties, show it to your friends and family, and also help us get this new concentration camps in America.
[01:57:00.727 --> 01:57:04.489]  Alex Jones calls on all patriots to expose growing evil.
[01:57:05.598 --> 01:57:11.123]  A very important 8 minute, 56 second video with a sneak peek in the middle from the film.
[01:57:11.123 --> 01:57:13.946]  Just a minute and a half of the film to give you an idea of what's in the documentary.
[01:57:13.946 --> 01:57:19.050]  This is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[01:57:19.050 --> 01:57:21.212]  Please make this go viral.
[01:57:21.212 --> 01:57:24.916]  We want to push this onto the front page of YouTube so it gets a half million hits.
[01:57:25.376 --> 01:57:30.219]  Or close to it, like our little iPad video we did last week.
[01:57:30.219 --> 01:57:32.040]  Well on its way to a half million.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.981]  Right up there getting close to 300,000 right now.
[01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:36.642]  So please, get this.
[01:57:36.642 --> 01:57:38.243]  Concentration Camps in America.
[01:57:38.243 --> 01:57:41.225]  Alex Jones calls on all patriots to expose growing evil.
[01:57:41.225 --> 01:57:44.146]  Please post this on your website, your blog, your Facebook.

[01:57:53.995 --> 01:57:57.599]  This is the best of the trailers and sneak peeks we've put out.
[01:57:57.599 --> 01:58:02.484]  8 minutes 56 seconds up on InfoWars.com right now.

[01:58:14.291 --> 01:58:14.871]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:58:27.521 --> 01:58:29.102]  All right, we're reaching the halfway point.
[01:58:29.102 --> 01:58:38.745]  The radio broadcast, Dr. Bob Bowman joins us coming up, and then an Oklahoma City bombing survivor who says it was an inside job and saw McVeigh and the government inside wiring the building.
[01:58:38.745 --> 01:58:43.127]  We'll be right back.

[01:58:57.841 --> 01:59:02.868]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?

[01:59:54.091 --> 01:59:56.492]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.492 --> 02:00:05.718]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.718 --> 02:00:07.018]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.018 --> 02:00:08.779]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.779 --> 02:00:10.560]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.141]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.141 --> 02:00:14.062]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.062 --> 02:00:17.865]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.865 --> 02:00:21.947]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.559 --> 02:00:27.041]  Okay, Dr. Bob Bowman thought he would be to his home by now, but he's not.
[02:00:27.041 --> 02:00:31.725]  He's on the road in his RV, driving his RV across the country.
[02:00:31.725 --> 02:00:40.771]  We've interviewed Willie Nelson from his bus before going down the road, so we'll see how this goes, but he's going to be to a parking spot in about 20 minutes, so we're honored to have him.
[02:00:40.771 --> 02:00:45.934]  Robert Bowman is a former director of the Advanced Space Program Development for the U.S.
[02:00:45.934 --> 02:00:49.697]  Air Force and the Ford and Carter administrations, and a former U.S.
[02:00:49.697 --> 02:00:50.878]  Air Force Lieutenant Colonel
[02:00:51.658 --> 02:00:59.223]  With 101 combat missions over Vietnam, he holds a PhD in aeronautics and nuclear engineering.
[02:00:59.223 --> 02:01:07.949]  And despite his involvement in the space program and defense, he emerged as an early public critic of the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI, aka Star Wars, during the Reagan administration.
[02:01:07.949 --> 02:01:12.392]  He's also a critic of George W. Bush's administration's national missile system.
[02:01:12.392 --> 02:01:15.695]  And he's a 9-11 researcher, truther,
[02:01:16.475 --> 02:01:19.797]  He's a great man, and we're honored to have him on with us.
[02:01:19.797 --> 02:01:29.243]  We're going to talk first, before he gets parked, about the latest 9-11 truth, about the talk of Iran supposedly having a nuke, and they're going to nuke us.
[02:01:29.243 --> 02:01:33.305]  The government now is saying Homeland Security's number one threat is the American people.
[02:01:33.305 --> 02:01:37.167]  I mean, we knew this was really being set up in the shadows, but now it's out in the open.
[02:01:37.167 --> 02:01:41.430]  The draconian Orwellian system we're sliding into.
[02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:44.812]  We're going to discuss this first with Dr. Bob Bowman, then we're going to get into Star Wars.
[02:01:45.632 --> 02:01:54.036]  How advanced it was, what he can talk about that's been declassified or leaked that he's allowed to discuss, versus what he projects they've got today.
[02:01:54.036 --> 02:01:56.717]  Dr. Bob Bowman, good to have you here with us.
[02:01:56.717 --> 02:01:59.019]  Thanks Alex, good to be back.
[02:01:59.019 --> 02:02:07.322]  There is so much going on, so much happening, but before we got a break, what do you think of 15 months into Barack Obama's administration?
[02:02:07.322 --> 02:02:10.284]  What do you think of him?
[02:02:10.284 --> 02:02:10.804]  Well of course,
[02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:41.687]  Like so many, I'm very disappointed, particularly with the expansion of the war in Afghanistan and extending it into Pakistan and even talking now, he hasn't, but others talking about the possibility of going into Iran and the new justifications of that based on this supposed Pentagon
[02:02:43.502 --> 02:02:54.111]  determination that, gee whiz, they might have not only nuclear weapons, but intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2015, if they get enough foreign help.
[02:02:54.111 --> 02:02:58.795]  I think that's a bunch of baloney, myself.
[02:02:58.795 --> 02:03:11.766]  Ballistic missiles are an extremely advanced, high technology project, and there are very few countries in the world that can pull that off.
[02:03:13.096 --> 02:03:23.300]  And some of them have been trying for decades, like North Korea, without success.
[02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:36.706]  I think this is just another justification doing for what a minority in the Pentagon want to do, and whether they're doing it because
[02:03:38.167 --> 02:03:43.388]  The Israelis want to do it or they're doing it for some other dumb reason, I don't know.
[02:03:43.388 --> 02:03:54.670]  But with our military already overextended and depleted and demoralized, it would be a horrendous mistake.
[02:03:54.670 --> 02:04:05.312]  Iran is much stronger militarily, a much larger country than Iraq and
[02:04:07.771 --> 02:04:14.533]  I mean, it would be, I think, the end of the United States as we know it.
[02:04:14.533 --> 02:04:28.598]  Well, sir, I heard Fox News last night on the radio saying Iran now has intercontinental ballistic long-range missiles and we've got to go in, and it's all over the news today, just like they said Iraq had nukes or WMDs.
[02:04:28.598 --> 02:04:32.099]  I mean, this is a replay of 2003, is it not?
[02:04:32.099 --> 02:04:34.200]  Of course it is, and it's total malarkey.
[02:04:35.899 --> 02:04:37.280]  Well, stay there, sir.
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:41.204]  We're going to come right back and get into this disaster for the United States.
[02:04:41.204 --> 02:04:44.807]  We've got the Russian president saying it could be the beginning of World War III.
[02:04:44.807 --> 02:04:50.233]  We're going to talk about it all on the other side with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[02:04:50.233 --> 02:04:58.000]  And we'll discuss Homeland Security now saying they're worried about Iran nuking us with a suitcase nuke and working with domestic groups.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.703]  Homeland Security's got to be used on the right-wingers now.
[02:05:02.810 --> 02:05:06.771]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.771 --> 02:05:15.634]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.634 --> 02:05:20.255]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.255 --> 02:05:31.078]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.718 --> 02:05:41.221]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.221 --> 02:05:46.662]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.662 --> 02:05:54.144]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:54.144 --> 02:05:56.905]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:06:04.902 --> 02:06:06.163]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:06.163 --> 02:06:10.105]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:10.105 --> 02:06:12.326]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.326 --> 02:06:17.749]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:24.859]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.859 --> 02:06:30.847]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:30.847 --> 02:06:34.513]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:06:34.993 --> 02:06:39.294]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:39.294 --> 02:06:45.235]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.235 --> 02:06:48.796]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.796 --> 02:06:50.756]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.756 --> 02:06:51.896]  It's here.

[02:07:07.648 --> 02:07:12.791]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:07:12.791 --> 02:07:21.516]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:07:21.516 --> 02:07:25.578]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:07:25.578 --> 02:07:27.540]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:07:29.861 --> 02:07:34.605]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:07:34.605 --> 02:07:39.669]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[02:07:39.669 --> 02:07:41.811]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:07:41.811 --> 02:07:43.592]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:07:43.592 --> 02:07:46.494]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:07:46.494 --> 02:07:53.120]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:55.822]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:07:55.822 --> 02:07:58.684]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[02:08:02.558 --> 02:08:04.780]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:10.586]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.586 --> 02:08:23.477]  We're going to go inside the secretive Star Wars program that's really a preemptive offensive sneak attack weapons system with Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of the Star Wars program.
[02:08:23.477 --> 02:08:26.320]  He joins us as he hurtles down the highway in his RV.
[02:08:31.021 --> 02:08:35.443]  Robert Bowman is a former director of the Advanced Space Program Development for the U.S.
[02:08:35.443 --> 02:08:44.666]  Air Force, holds a PhD in aeronautics and nuclear engineering, flew 101 combat missions over Vietnam, bombing missions.
[02:08:44.666 --> 02:08:48.848]  And he joins us today, and we really appreciate him coming on.
[02:08:48.848 --> 02:08:54.330]  For stations that just joined us, some people that just joined us, we were talking about the new hype to go into Iran.
[02:08:54.330 --> 02:08:57.592]  They're changing the last letter of Iraq, the Q,
[02:08:59.012 --> 02:09:02.314]  And putting an N on it to make Iran.
[02:09:02.314 --> 02:09:12.881]  And they're saying they've got secret nuclear technology nobody else has got with no proof to make enriched uranium, weapons-grade uranium without centrifuges.
[02:09:12.881 --> 02:09:15.703]  They're saying they've got ICBMs that can hit us now.
[02:09:16.977 --> 02:09:19.299]  The Pentagon says maybe in five years.
[02:09:19.299 --> 02:09:20.661]  North Korea is much more advanced.
[02:09:20.661 --> 02:09:21.802]  You can't ever get them off the ground.
[02:09:21.802 --> 02:09:23.323]  They blow up almost every time.
[02:09:23.323 --> 02:09:25.185]  You just ride on the pad.
[02:09:25.185 --> 02:09:26.567]  Sometimes they go up a few thousand feet.
[02:09:26.567 --> 02:09:35.416]  I mean, even our own government in the 50s, 60s, and 70s had large portions of their ICBMs when they were being tested blowing up or blowing up before they left the atmosphere.
[02:09:36.116 --> 02:09:41.938]  But oh no, and they've got magnetic pulse weapons, the news says, that could destroy all electronics.
[02:09:41.938 --> 02:09:45.379]  Here's Reuters, Iran missile may be able to hit U.S.
[02:09:45.379 --> 02:09:51.482]  Here's another one, Times of London, Pentagon chiefs raise threat of attack as Iran taunts U.S.
[02:09:51.482 --> 02:09:53.342]  with missile display.
[02:09:53.342 --> 02:09:55.163]  So we can show our weapons, but they can't.
[02:09:56.513 --> 02:10:02.858]  And here's another one, Al-Qaeda chief in Iraq, captured, killed, never actually existed, recaptured, now killed again.
[02:10:02.858 --> 02:10:09.644]  They've announced over and over again they kill these Al-Qaeda guys and never retract the last guy they killed, even though they claim they kill them again.
[02:10:09.644 --> 02:10:16.489]  And then here's another one over here, where they're claiming that Fox News is claiming that
[02:10:17.330 --> 02:10:25.116]  I'm looking for my article, just printed again, a Fox News headline, Osama Bin Laden has a Facebook, and then it admits to the next line it's not even him.
[02:10:25.116 --> 02:10:35.245]  So anybody could create a Facebook, say they're threatening us as Osama Bin Laden, and it always turns out it's fake, but that's the proof that they're going to kill us if we don't give all our rights up.
[02:10:35.245 --> 02:10:42.451]  And as it went to break, Dr. Bowman, you were saying this is all a fraud, and that this could basically end the United States.
[02:10:42.451 --> 02:10:43.792]  Go through that scenario for us.
[02:10:45.390 --> 02:11:04.776]  Well, we're being lied to again, as you know, about all this stuff about Iran as justification for the war that a few people want to get us into as if we didn't have enough illegal corporate wars of aggression right now.
[02:11:04.776 --> 02:11:09.577]  And if we take on Iran, which is
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:20.388]  Much bigger and more powerful than Iraq was, and we're still bogged down in Iraq.
[02:11:20.388 --> 02:11:23.571]  Where are we going to get the military for that?
[02:11:23.571 --> 02:11:29.016]  Our military is already overextended with what they've got on their plate.
[02:11:29.016 --> 02:11:32.739]  And, of course, what is Russia going to do?
[02:11:32.739 --> 02:11:35.061]  What is China going to do?
[02:11:35.061 --> 02:11:37.163]  And are we just
[02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:41.462]  Would we be taking on much more than we can handle?
[02:11:41.462 --> 02:11:46.904]  And, uh, I believe we've already got more than we can handle.
[02:11:46.904 --> 02:11:52.107]  And we've got to get out of where we are.
[02:11:52.107 --> 02:11:55.489]  And absolutely no attack on Iran.
[02:11:55.489 --> 02:12:01.752]  It would be another false attack based on lies.
[02:12:01.752 --> 02:12:07.055]  And, uh, I don't think they're going to do it because
[02:12:10.014 --> 02:12:34.001]  Most of the people surrounding Obama are neocons, well they're trilateral commission, they're globalists, but most of them are not neocons, and I think they're a little more rational than Cheney and his minions pulling George W. Bush's strings.
[02:12:34.001 --> 02:12:36.722]  So, and the people in the Pentagon now,
[02:12:37.942 --> 02:12:48.184]  Are more rational than Rumsfeld and some of the generals he had working for him.
[02:12:48.184 --> 02:12:57.885]  So I don't see them succeeding in pulling this off, even with this massive campaign of lies.
[02:12:57.885 --> 02:13:02.086]  But, you know, I'm going to work very hard to prevent it.
[02:13:02.086 --> 02:13:07.087]  And I'll probably have to put out another open letter to the Pentagon, just like I did
[02:13:08.088 --> 02:13:13.973]  Uh, in 2007, to keep Cheney from attacking the Iran-Nens.
[02:13:13.973 --> 02:13:14.913]  Alright, let me stop you there.
[02:13:14.913 --> 02:13:16.274]  I'm going to have to do it again.
[02:13:16.274 --> 02:13:20.337]  Doctor, let me stop you there and we'll go over some of what you said in your letter, and they did listen to you.
[02:13:20.337 --> 02:13:26.502]  We had Fox Fallon refuse in 2008 to launch an attack on Iran-Nens.
[02:13:26.502 --> 02:13:31.265]  They've had a lot of people resign that basically stopped Cheney, and how that ties into 888.
[02:13:31.265 --> 02:13:36.129]  For those that don't know, the Times of London and other publications have now talked to diplomats and others
[02:13:37.418 --> 02:13:37.978]  We're good to go.
[02:13:56.607 --> 02:14:05.755]  Three days into it, because they were landing more NATO forces in Georgian capital, and said, we may have to have a nuclear war with you.
[02:14:05.755 --> 02:14:21.549]  And so this shows the megalomania, and it appears with Gates and others that we still have the Cheney people in there, and they're replaying all the same propaganda that we saw before Oklahoma City, before 9-11, and before the Iraq war.
[02:14:22.089 --> 02:14:23.750]  All rolled into one.
[02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:27.571]  We've got FEMA drills of improvised nuclear devices going off.
[02:14:27.571 --> 02:14:35.094]  We've got Obama saying the number one threat to America is now domestic groups or Iran setting off nukes inside the U.S.
[02:14:36.972 --> 02:14:43.697]  Again, Dr. Bowman, couldn't they stage a false flag terror attack in the United States to blame it on Iran?
[02:14:43.697 --> 02:14:45.759]  I mean, isn't that their only card?
[02:14:45.759 --> 02:14:57.968]  It appears they're going forward with this, and absent a huge false flag, or a nuke going off in Paris, who knows what, staged by the military-industrial complex, how are they going to get this, and is that a danger?
[02:14:57.968 --> 02:15:01.111]  Well, I think you're exactly right.
[02:15:01.111 --> 02:15:06.455]  The only way they would succeed in getting the war
[02:15:07.538 --> 02:15:15.622]  against Iran is another false flag attack like 9-11, blaming it on Iran.
[02:15:15.622 --> 02:15:32.569]  And, you know, back a couple years ago when that B-52 flew from Minot to Bartsdale, as far as I know, there's still possibly one nuclear weapon missing from that bomber.
[02:15:35.639 --> 02:15:52.584]  If the neocons have that, then they could use it in a false flag attack on Iran, claiming that Iran smuggled it in in a suitcase.
[02:15:52.584 --> 02:15:57.845]  They can't simulate an intercontinental ballistic missile attack on the United States.
[02:15:58.982 --> 02:16:00.043]  Too complicated.
[02:16:00.043 --> 02:16:02.884]  Everybody would know where it came from.
[02:16:02.884 --> 02:16:07.586]  And they can't get an ICBM and a launch pad for it to Iran.
[02:16:07.586 --> 02:16:11.328]  So I think you're right.
[02:16:11.328 --> 02:16:15.690]  A false flag attack is the only way they're going to pull this off.
[02:16:15.690 --> 02:16:25.875]  And the thing is that the 9-11 Truth Movement is extremely valuable because we're continually letting them know that we're watching.
[02:16:26.625 --> 02:16:37.351]  And if they try something else like they did in 9-11, they've got to know that we're watching and we're liable to catch them red-handed, and that'll be the end of them.
[02:16:37.351 --> 02:16:42.535]  And so, that's one of the great values of 9-11 Truth.
[02:16:42.535 --> 02:16:47.117]  It is deterring them from this kind of thing.
[02:16:47.117 --> 02:16:51.480]  But I know there are some crazies there who would like to try it anyway.
[02:16:52.349 --> 02:16:58.374]  Well, let's take the Minot, Dakota situation where they flew them down to Louisiana.
[02:16:58.374 --> 02:17:00.916]  And again, the reports are there is a missing nuke.
[02:17:00.916 --> 02:17:02.016]  I mean, this was in the news.
[02:17:02.016 --> 02:17:02.957]  This happened.
[02:17:02.957 --> 02:17:15.707]  And then more than a dozen of the people who were at the bases who blew the whistle committed suicide or died within a week, which adds another layer of evidence that this was an attempt
[02:17:16.147 --> 02:17:20.449]  To smuggle a nuke out of the chain of custody with the military.
[02:17:20.449 --> 02:17:33.273]  And again, for those who don't understand what me and Dr. Bob Bowman are getting at here, you have to put your mind in the mind, put yourself in the mind of the globalist, of the controllers, to realize how they're doing all of this.
[02:17:33.273 --> 02:17:37.555]  And they'll never get away with an Iran attack without staging an event.
[02:17:37.555 --> 02:17:40.156]  And then now FEMA, these secret documents,
[02:17:40.916 --> 02:17:41.717]  Got leaked.
[02:17:41.717 --> 02:17:54.648]  FEMA admits they're real, but is ordering websites to remove them, that in May they were going to have multiple simulated improvised nuclear device detonations in different parts of the U.S.
[02:17:54.648 --> 02:17:59.392]  Clearly, we know they've used drills in the past to smokescreen their real operations.
[02:17:59.392 --> 02:18:00.113]  Why?
[02:18:00.113 --> 02:18:02.855]  Why are drills so important in and around terror attacks?
[02:18:02.855 --> 02:18:04.136]  We saw it on 7-7.
[02:18:04.136 --> 02:18:05.337]  We saw it on 9-11.
[02:18:05.337 --> 02:18:06.418]  We see it over and over again.
[02:18:06.418 --> 02:18:07.920]  Dr. Bob Bowman, why is that so important?
[02:18:09.562 --> 02:18:15.627]  Well, it confuses people who are trying to defend against something.
[02:18:15.627 --> 02:18:34.922]  The exercises going on on 9-11, of course, kept a lot of our interceptors away from protecting the Northeast Corridor and also confused the radar and the controllers and
[02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:46.252]  Made it much easier for Cheney or whoever to get away with their stand-down order.
[02:18:46.252 --> 02:19:00.346]  And they get to bootleg the actual attack through the drill funding, and if other good elements of the government, 99% not involved, catch them in the act, they can just say it's part of a drill.
[02:19:00.346 --> 02:19:00.947]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:04.537 --> 02:19:07.179]  Which of course is the true story of Valkyrie.
[02:19:07.179 --> 02:19:16.825]  The Germans used a government drill program as an attempt to reverse engineer it and overthrow Hitler, but that failed.
[02:19:16.825 --> 02:19:17.045]  Yes.
[02:19:18.801 --> 02:19:28.406]  Dr. Bob Bowman, we're going to break and come back and continue to discuss false flag terrorism and your concern and time frames and how you think we can stop this.
[02:19:28.406 --> 02:19:35.630]  I agree with you that it is essential, that it is vital that 9-11 Truth continue to expand.
[02:19:35.630 --> 02:19:44.234]  We've also seen preparatory demonization of 9-11 Truth, claiming we're going to stage terror attack by CNN, MSNBC and Fox News the last three months.
[02:19:44.754 --> 02:19:51.322]  As a preparatory event so that they can try to discredit us or maybe even claim we're involved when the attacks take place.
[02:19:51.322 --> 02:19:52.524]  All of it's on the table.
[02:19:52.524 --> 02:19:55.367]  They're clearly moving in this direction very rapidly.
[02:19:55.367 --> 02:19:56.489]  Dr. Bob Bowman's our guest.
[02:19:56.489 --> 02:19:58.431]  We'll give you his website on the other side.
[02:19:58.431 --> 02:19:58.892]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.502 --> 02:20:05.045]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:20:05.045 --> 02:20:07.347]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:20:07.347 --> 02:20:08.208]  Don't!
[02:20:08.208 --> 02:20:11.651]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:20:11.651 --> 02:20:18.778]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'

[02:20:27.165 --> 02:20:35.329]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:20:35.329 --> 02:20:36.490]  Herb K. was right.
[02:20:36.490 --> 02:20:39.712]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:39.712 --> 02:20:41.152]  What have you got to lose?

[02:22:00.951 --> 02:22:03.253]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:03.253 --> 02:22:05.654]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:05.654 --> 02:22:08.876]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:08.876 --> 02:22:13.979]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:13.979 --> 02:22:18.162]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.482 --> 02:22:20.825]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:20.825 --> 02:22:23.389]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:23.389 --> 02:22:26.633]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:26.633 --> 02:22:34.243]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:34.563 --> 02:22:39.948]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:39.948 --> 02:22:42.270]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:46.514]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:46.514 --> 02:22:47.575]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:47.575 --> 02:22:48.916]  You're everyone else.

[02:23:54.281 --> 02:23:57.143]  Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars program, is our guest.
[02:24:14.468 --> 02:24:19.494]  He exposed SDI prominently as a offensive sneak attack weapon.
[02:24:19.494 --> 02:24:30.187]  We're going to be talking about that with him and I want him to go as far as he can legally with when he was there in the 70s and early 80s just how advanced these systems were.
[02:24:31.128 --> 02:24:37.571]  Uh, and now they're more and more admitting they have these space planes and that the NASA program we see is just a vestigial front.
[02:24:37.571 --> 02:24:41.653]  Uh, that the real program is almost entirely Pentagon and military.
[02:24:41.653 --> 02:24:46.495]  Uh, Dr. Bob Bowman, I mean, amazing information you were just discussing.
[02:24:46.495 --> 02:24:52.898]  The fact that you agree with my analysis, they are hyping false flag nuke attacks, saying it's the number one threat.
[02:24:53.798 --> 02:24:57.119]  Obama said that on last Friday at the big D.C.
[02:24:57.119 --> 02:24:58.059]  Summit.
[02:24:58.059 --> 02:25:00.140]  They're now saying domestic groups are going to attack.
[02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:08.243]  Bill Clinton's saying domestic groups are going to attack, that the Tea Parties and people should shut up about the banking bailout, or we're going to cause a terror attack.
[02:25:08.243 --> 02:25:10.663]  I mean, I've seen this over and over again.
[02:25:10.663 --> 02:25:22.107]  In my gut, there's no doubt they're moving with domestic attacks to blame it on domestic groups, blowing up federal buildings, and seriously considering detonating a nuke and saying Iran smuggled it in.
[02:25:23.167 --> 02:25:24.487]  I think you're exactly right, Alex.
[02:25:24.487 --> 02:25:26.068]  They're doing all this stuff and they're trying to
[02:25:46.577 --> 02:25:52.423]  Make domestic groups, in other words, we the people, the enemy.
[02:25:52.423 --> 02:25:59.491]  And, you know, like we've said before, we must be winning.
[02:25:59.491 --> 02:26:05.717]  Because as Gandhi said, first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:26:05.717 --> 02:26:08.961]  We must be winning because they're already to be attacking the space.
[02:26:11.493 --> 02:26:13.474]  You're absolutely right, Doctor.
[02:26:13.474 --> 02:26:23.199]  Going back to 888 briefly, then we're going to come back and get into what's happening with the economy and then Star Wars and other issues you'd like to discuss and how we can reach out to the Pentagon.
[02:26:23.199 --> 02:26:36.885]  888, the bottom line on what happened there and what type of window does that give us into the psyche and into the war planning of the people running our government?
[02:26:40.618 --> 02:26:46.321]  Well, first, tell me what you mean by 888.
[02:26:46.321 --> 02:26:54.964]  888, the situation in 2008, the operations by Georgia against South Ossetia.
[02:26:54.964 --> 02:26:57.666]  Oh, right, right.
[02:26:57.666 --> 02:27:07.170]  Well, we know that that was orchestrated by the elements of the United States and as a provocation to Russia.
[02:27:11.872 --> 02:27:29.624]  Russia came in to protect its people, but it, I think, exercised admirable restraint by not going all the way and taking over Georgia.
[02:27:29.624 --> 02:27:37.450]  But what does that say about the psyche of Dick Cheney, that it's now come out in mainstream news that he wanted to go ahead and have a nuclear war with Russia?
[02:27:38.956 --> 02:27:51.141]  Well, he's the same kind of megalomaniac, evil genius that Kurt LeMay was at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:27:51.141 --> 02:28:02.947]  I mean, when JFK and Khrushchev were able to defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis, General Kurt LeMay was absolutely incensed.
[02:28:02.947 --> 02:28:05.308]  He says, we lost!
[02:28:05.308 --> 02:28:08.349]  Because he wanted that to result in a nuclear war.
[02:28:11.195 --> 02:28:25.768]  In fact, the maker of Dr. Strangelove, the director who did his research, Stanley Kubrick, said that General Jack T. Ripper character is Curtis LeMay.
[02:28:25.768 --> 02:28:26.889]  Of course.
[02:28:26.889 --> 02:28:31.893]  And to those of us who knew LeMay, it was obvious when we watched the movie.
[02:28:33.979 --> 02:28:35.781]  Unbelievable.
[02:28:35.781 --> 02:28:36.741]  How did you awaken?
[02:28:36.741 --> 02:28:39.664]  We're going to break, but I want you to talk about this when we come back, but go ahead and start.
[02:28:39.664 --> 02:28:44.608]  I mean, you're 101 Combat Missions, Vietnam, you know, Warhawk.
[02:28:44.608 --> 02:28:46.549]  You get in the highest levels of the Pentagon.
[02:28:46.549 --> 02:28:50.012]  What woke you up to all this?
[02:28:50.012 --> 02:28:58.799]  Well, it was really being sort of on the inside when the crazies first got
[02:28:59.770 --> 02:29:00.350]  We're good to go.
[02:29:26.917 --> 02:29:34.463]  You know, I told them they were absolutely crazy and I didn't go to any more of their meetings and I started fighting them in public.
[02:29:34.463 --> 02:29:35.844]  All right, stay there, Dr. Bowman.
[02:29:35.844 --> 02:29:38.466]  When we come back, I want you to start over and continue.
[02:29:38.466 --> 02:29:40.748]  Let's get into Star Wars right now.
[02:29:40.748 --> 02:29:51.817]  We'll be right back with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[02:29:51.817 --> 02:29:53.198]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.198 --> 02:29:54.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.706 --> 02:30:01.328]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.328 --> 02:30:02.488]  What's your home worth?
[02:30:02.488 --> 02:30:04.609]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[02:30:04.609 --> 02:30:07.650]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[02:31:01.445 --> 02:31:04.469]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:09.796]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.796 --> 02:31:11.839]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.839 --> 02:31:16.845]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.845 --> 02:31:18.027]  How much do you want?
[02:31:18.027 --> 02:31:18.768]  When do you want it?
[02:31:19.148 --> 02:31:21.029]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:21.029 --> 02:31:22.109]  When will you need it?
[02:31:22.109 --> 02:31:24.290]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.290 --> 02:31:25.630]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:25.630 --> 02:31:27.171]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:27.171 --> 02:31:32.433]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.433 --> 02:31:35.554]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:36.014 --> 02:31:39.835]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.835 --> 02:31:41.055]  How much will you need?
[02:31:41.055 --> 02:31:41.955]  We don't know.
[02:31:41.955 --> 02:31:43.075]  How much do you want?
[02:31:43.075 --> 02:31:43.816]  All you can get.
[02:31:43.816 --> 02:31:45.096]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:45.096 --> 02:31:48.137]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:48.137 --> 02:31:50.977]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:50.977 --> 02:31:51.737]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:00.563 --> 02:32:01.864]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:01.864 --> 02:32:07.449]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:32:07.449 --> 02:32:12.474]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:32:12.474 --> 02:32:17.499]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:32:18.039 --> 02:32:23.264]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:32:23.264 --> 02:32:25.566]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:32:25.566 --> 02:32:30.371]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:32:30.371 --> 02:32:31.492]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:31.492 --> 02:32:34.575]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:32:34.575 --> 02:32:37.858]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:32:38.178 --> 02:32:41.360]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.

[02:32:43.581 --> 02:32:44.521]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:32:44.521 --> 02:32:44.721]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:44.721 --> 02:32:48.163]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:32:48.163 --> 02:32:49.904]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:33:02.455 --> 02:33:05.217]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:05.217 --> 02:33:13.782]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:13.782 --> 02:33:17.144]  ThePatriots.us is Dr. Bob Bowman's website.
[02:33:17.144 --> 02:33:21.726]  ThePatriots.us and valuable information up on the side.
[02:33:21.726 --> 02:33:22.287]  He'll be with us.
[02:33:24.953 --> 02:33:35.099]  Or a half hour into the next hour, then we have an eyewitness from the Alfred P. Murrow building, Jane Graham, who saw McVeigh and other feds inside planting the bombs.
[02:33:35.099 --> 02:33:37.881]  She was told, oh, those gray sticks of butter are just for repair.
[02:33:37.881 --> 02:33:43.325]  They're just putting some wires in the different maintenance areas for everyone's safety.
[02:33:43.325 --> 02:33:44.906]  She rode on the elevator with McVeigh.
[02:33:45.586 --> 02:33:52.671]  And this is just one of many witnesses we've interviewed before, but since the Feds are getting ready to do this again, we're here on air going back over it.
[02:33:52.671 --> 02:33:58.135]  So we're going to be talking about that with Jane Graham coming up in T-minus one hour.
[02:33:58.135 --> 02:34:02.799]  Okay, Dr. Bob Bowman, you were hurtling down the road in your RV.
[02:34:02.799 --> 02:34:06.461]  You've now gotten to your stop for the night, so we've got you settled here.
[02:34:06.461 --> 02:34:08.163]  We appreciate you coming on on short notice.
[02:34:08.823 --> 02:34:13.948]  And we really appreciate you coming on because I know you've had a lot of health problems lately and your information is so precious.
[02:34:13.948 --> 02:34:18.953]  It was good to get to see you at that 9-11 Truth Event a month or so ago here in Austin, Texas.
[02:34:18.953 --> 02:34:24.638]  And we appreciate, again, your tireless effort to warn people, much of the time at your own expense.
[02:34:24.638 --> 02:34:25.999]  Okay, I'm going to stop now.
[02:34:25.999 --> 02:34:30.423]  Go back to what you said as we went to break about when you really woke up to this global criminal
[02:34:31.324 --> 02:34:36.227]  Network, because we know that Rumsfeld came right out of the L.L.
[02:34:36.227 --> 02:34:38.629]  Lemonsir crew years after he left.
[02:34:38.629 --> 02:34:39.850]  I mean, he's been there forever.
[02:34:39.850 --> 02:34:43.392]  The youngest and then the oldest Secretary of Defense.
[02:34:43.392 --> 02:34:49.717]  He sat at the feet of these cold warriors who wrote up Operation Northwoods.
[02:34:49.717 --> 02:34:53.559]  Of course, the plan to style to stage 9-11 style attacks.
[02:34:53.559 --> 02:34:56.841]  So you were getting up to Star Wars and what it was really designed for.
[02:34:56.841 --> 02:34:57.502]  Then we'll talk about
[02:34:57.722 --> 02:35:03.904]  Okay Alex, well, yes, I found out first hand that these crazies were planning on using my Star Wars program as part of a
[02:35:24.972 --> 02:35:28.393]  First strike against the Soviet Union.
[02:35:28.393 --> 02:35:32.535]  And so I started opposing them on that.
[02:35:32.535 --> 02:35:41.139]  And pretty soon, of course, I found I had less freedom of speech in industry than I've had in the military.
[02:35:41.139 --> 02:35:46.921]  So before long, I was out of industry and unemployed.
[02:35:46.921 --> 02:35:49.962]  And I have been in that position now for 28 years.
[02:35:56.195 --> 02:36:22.934]  When I started fighting Reagan and his crowd, General Danny Graham, and the crazy George Keegan, and Senator Malcolm Wallop, and Edward Teller, and Dick Cheney, and whatnot, and the ones that didn't die off, like Teller and Danny Graham, the ones that didn't die off came right back with George W. Bush.
[02:36:23.570 --> 02:36:37.097]  But what they did back then in 1982 and 1983, they got Reagan, who had not a clue what he was doing, and I don't think George W. Bush did either.
[02:36:37.097 --> 02:36:42.919]  They were useful idiots to these global criminals.
[02:36:42.919 --> 02:36:49.503]  And they got Reagan to sign a defense guidance document in 1982, which did
[02:36:52.597 --> 02:36:55.279]  Two important things.
[02:36:55.279 --> 02:37:09.152]  One, on the larger scale, it ended our policy of using the military to prevent a nuclear war.
[02:37:09.152 --> 02:37:14.116]  And we went from a policy of war prevention to one of war fighting.
[02:37:14.116 --> 02:37:19.661]  And in that document, written of course by Richard Perle, part of the Cheney crowd,
[02:37:21.155 --> 02:37:31.502]  In that document, he ordered the Department of Defense to prepare to fight and win a protracted nuclear war.
[02:37:31.502 --> 02:37:33.503]  Now, that's chilling.
[02:37:33.503 --> 02:37:41.648]  And that was leaked to the press by my old friend Bob Scheer, who used to be with the Los Angeles Times.
[02:37:41.648 --> 02:37:47.252]  And eventually, of course, because he was a good, honest reporter, he got himself fired.
[02:37:47.252 --> 02:37:50.574]  He leaked that defense guidance document.
[02:37:51.361 --> 02:38:07.052]  And there were many of us, I think, at the time who said, well, you know, when we went into the military, it was to protect the people of this country by preventing a nuclear war, not going out and fighting an aggressive nuclear war.
[02:38:07.052 --> 02:38:10.914]  So we wouldn't have any part of that kind of policy.
[02:38:10.914 --> 02:38:20.921]  The second thing that that defense guidance document did was to order the Department of Defense to deploy Star Wars weapons in space as soon as possible.
[02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:28.266]  And, uh, the document assigned those weapons two missions.
[02:38:28.266 --> 02:38:39.016]  The first mission was to destroy opposing satellites and seize total military control of space.
[02:38:39.016 --> 02:38:47.144]  The second mission was to destroy targets on the surface of the Earth from space without warning.
[02:38:48.277 --> 02:38:53.419]  There wasn't a word in that document about shooting down ballistic missiles.
[02:38:53.419 --> 02:39:07.724]  That whole peace shield garbage was a total myth for consumption by the American people who would never have approved Star Wars weapons for offensive purposes.
[02:39:11.269 --> 02:39:18.510]  And now we've gotten another bird's eye view into their mindset with Cheney having Georgia on 8-8-8.
[02:39:20.310 --> 02:39:29.112]  Two years ago, two and a half years ago, launched that sneak attack and we've seen Iraq, we've seen Afghanistan, they now want to go into Iran.
[02:39:29.112 --> 02:39:42.296]  We see this doctrine in the PNAC documents from 2000 where they say we need new Pearl Harbor events, we need terror attacks to get the American people to go out there and wage these wars of empire.
[02:39:42.296 --> 02:39:45.796]  But this isn't even an empire for the American people, it's an empire we pay for.
[02:39:45.796 --> 02:39:47.597]  It's an empire for these big mega banks
[02:39:48.377 --> 02:39:55.851]  And corporations please continue with the Star Wars program, but let's let's start at the beginning Because it's now declassified.
[02:39:55.851 --> 02:39:57.514]  It's now public it's now admitted.
[02:39:57.514 --> 02:39:58.936]  We heard that Ronald Reagan
[02:39:59.795 --> 02:40:01.616]  Launched Star Wars in 81.
[02:40:01.616 --> 02:40:15.701]  But then now we've gotten the Bohemian Grove documents that they released to Santa Rosa State University, Bohemian Grove did, that in 79, before he was even president, they were there talking about the program that the Air Force had, that you ran, that they were going to weaponize.
[02:40:15.701 --> 02:40:21.603]  So that's now been released, and the San Francisco Chronicles reported on it as well.
[02:40:21.603 --> 02:40:24.144]  And so what was that program when you ran it?
[02:40:24.144 --> 02:40:25.205]  How advanced was it?
[02:40:26.345 --> 02:40:30.927]  Well, I retired in 1978, and the program had been going on actually since 1962.
[02:40:30.927 --> 02:40:32.728]  At that time, they called it Bambi.
[02:40:53.484 --> 02:40:57.967]  Which stands for Ballistic Missile Boost Intercept.
[02:40:57.967 --> 02:41:05.531]  Isn't it lovely the way they take our weapon systems and give them a nice, cuddly name like Bambi?
[02:41:05.531 --> 02:41:14.537]  And when the Soviets, for a while, were working on a similar system, they dubbed it the Killer Satellite.
[02:41:14.537 --> 02:41:18.820]  So, anyway, that's just, you know, a little trivia.
[02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:21.201]  But at that time, in the mid-1970s,
[02:41:23.047 --> 02:41:26.130]  We were working on several pieces of it.
[02:41:26.130 --> 02:41:32.855]  Most of what we were working on was toward a system of laser battle stations.
[02:41:32.855 --> 02:41:39.801]  And these laser battle stations were being developed in bits and pieces.
[02:41:39.801 --> 02:41:46.126]  We had a contract with TRW for the laser itself, chemical laser.
[02:41:46.126 --> 02:41:51.310]  We had a contract with Kodak and with Perkin Elmer
[02:41:51.966 --> 02:42:02.491]  To build a 50-foot diameter actively cooled mirror which could reflect the laser beam to its target without burning up.
[02:42:02.491 --> 02:42:10.675]  We were developing the Pointer Tracker System and the Fault Tolerance Spaceborne Computer with Raytheon.
[02:42:10.675 --> 02:42:15.377]  And we had system studies to put it all together with Lockheed.
[02:42:17.105 --> 02:42:20.807]  That's a little of what we were doing with laser battle stations.
[02:42:20.807 --> 02:42:44.381]  We were also, and by the way, in our studies, and we also had some other organizations doing studies for us, Aerospace Corporation and RAND Corporation, on the military effectiveness of these things, and the RAND Corporation study concluded that before a system of laser battle stations got good enough to be
[02:42:45.308 --> 02:42:58.356]  Uh, effective against ballistic missiles, they would be powerful enough to incinerate cities in minutes, causing the kind of firestorms that consumed Dresden and Hamburg and Osaka in World War II.
[02:42:58.356 --> 02:43:04.700]  We also were looking at, uh, kinetic energy tail vehicles.
[02:43:04.700 --> 02:43:13.705]  Uh, the kinds of things that, uh, later became brilliant pebbles, uh, smart rocks first, then brilliant pebbles, and then rods from God,
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:30.112]  Where you take a few pounds of metal, properly shaped, fired at the Earth from space, and it impacts like a meteorite, and at least in theory, is capable of destroying hardened military targets like missile silos and command bunkers, totally without warning.
[02:43:30.112 --> 02:43:31.253]  That would be DU.
[02:43:31.253 --> 02:43:33.555]  That would be DU, correct, Doctor?
[02:43:33.555 --> 02:43:34.115]  That was what?
[02:43:34.115 --> 02:43:39.920]  Uh, those, uh, those meteor gun weapons, would that be DU, depleted uranium?
[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:42.562]  Yeah, and I never said that at the time,
[02:43:43.503 --> 02:43:53.035]  Uh, but, uh, yes, uh, they're a combination of titanium and depleted uranium.
[02:43:53.035 --> 02:44:00.605]  Uh, titanium shell with the depleted uranium interior and guided by GPS.
[02:44:02.171 --> 02:44:29.091]  And I never revealed those details at the time, but a couple years later I was debating one of the General Abramson's colonels in the Strategic Defense Initiative organization, and I started talking about the pure offensive purposes of Star Wars weapons, and in his rebuttal he said, now, you know very well that those
[02:44:30.839 --> 02:44:37.160]  Titanium cones fired at the Earth from space and directed by GPS.
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:39.601]  That program doesn't exist.
[02:44:39.601 --> 02:44:49.903]  And he said, well, I said, well, that's interesting because you just revealed classified details that I've never talked about and certainly didn't mention in my talk.
[02:44:49.903 --> 02:44:52.884]  So obviously the program does exist.
[02:44:52.884 --> 02:44:57.345]  And so since then I've been able to tell more details.
[02:44:59.611 --> 02:45:10.596]  Now, when we talked, you said you're also allowed to reveal that it's robotic space planes, and you've been out of this for a long time, but...
[02:45:11.792 --> 02:45:24.566]  I mean, from what I've talked to people at NASA here in Texas, people who were on the original Apollo program and beyond, and some of them we've had on air, and these are guys you can watch the NASA film footage, and there they are on mission control.
[02:45:24.566 --> 02:45:30.673]  They say that more than 90% of NASA, which is run by the Pentagon and by the President,
[02:45:31.554 --> 02:45:34.576]  Right, well, space has been militarized for a very long time.
[02:46:01.349 --> 02:46:17.255]  Most of the stuff up there are military satellites of one kind or another, either reconnaissance satellites or military communications satellites and various other things.
[02:46:17.255 --> 02:46:23.777]  The weapons themselves may not be up there, but the gun sites are up there and all the rest of it.
[02:46:23.777 --> 02:46:29.179]  So the whole military command and control system is space-based.
[02:46:31.963 --> 02:46:43.386]  My task, really, when Reagan was trying to do all this stuff, was not to keep space from being militarized, as it already was, but to keep it from being weaponized.
[02:46:43.386 --> 02:46:47.127]  Because that's the line we simply did not want to cross.
[02:46:47.127 --> 02:46:55.309]  We understood that when we put weapons in space that, you know, and particularly if they were
[02:46:56.215 --> 02:47:08.900]  The kind of stuff like Star Wars weapons with the kind of offensive capabilities they represented, that the Soviet Union would have no choice but to start shooting them down as fast as we put them up.
[02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:13.882]  And of course, that was a task that was fairly simple.
[02:47:13.882 --> 02:47:19.624]  These space-based weapons are extremely vulnerable.
[02:47:19.624 --> 02:47:21.865]  After all, they follow fixed orbits.
[02:47:22.631 --> 02:47:27.698]  So you always know in advance exactly where they're going to be at any given time.
[02:47:27.698 --> 02:47:37.430]  The mirrors that we were designing could be destroyed by such exotic anti-satellite weapons as a bucket of sand or a thimble full of sewing machine oil.
[02:47:39.492 --> 02:47:49.014]  Uh, I always told the government, look, these things are never going to have any defensive value because of their enormous vulnerability.
[02:47:49.014 --> 02:48:06.658]  They will be totally useless to an innocent party sitting back trying to defend himself because all the opposing side will do will be to knock out, uh, critical elements in the system first and then launch their missiles.
[02:48:06.658 --> 02:48:08.798]  And even if you made these things,
[02:48:09.708 --> 02:48:22.096]  So that they could, in fact, shoot down ballistic missiles, which they couldn't do at that time, they would be useless because they'd be put out of operation before the missiles were fired.
[02:48:22.096 --> 02:48:25.818]  And I thought that was a pretty good argument.
[02:48:25.818 --> 02:48:36.825]  I also pointed out that having these Star Wars weapons on both sides is the ultimate military lunacy because it rewards whoever shoots first.
[02:48:37.749 --> 02:48:50.860]  And what we had at that point in the 70s was a stable nuclear balance because whoever fired first lost the war.
[02:48:50.860 --> 02:48:54.543]  And the new technology changed that.
[02:48:54.543 --> 02:48:55.544]  Doctor, let's go back.
[02:48:55.544 --> 02:49:01.008]  We've got plenty of time to continue, but while we've got you, I want to go back.
[02:49:01.008 --> 02:49:05.192]  What can you tell us about the robotic space planes?
[02:49:08.580 --> 02:49:10.580]  Uh, not very much.
[02:49:10.580 --> 02:49:33.785]  I mean, if you take a design roughly based on the shuttle and you eliminate all the, uh, uh, people from it and all the life support systems and all the oxygen and all the food and, and all the piss tubes and all, you know, all of that kind of stuff and make it robotic with, uh,
[02:49:35.035 --> 02:49:39.840]  So you can only hypothetically talk to us about what's going on because that's classified?
[02:49:56.499 --> 02:50:08.187]  Well, now NASA admits they have been developing space planes, and the Pentagon admits, you know, like the B-1 bomber, the B-2 bomber were secret for many, many years, with the stealth bomber for 20 years before they rolled it out.
[02:50:08.187 --> 02:50:20.996]  I mean, can you talk about how big the military NASA is versus the public NASA?
[02:50:20.996 --> 02:50:24.038]  Short answer to that is I don't know anymore.
[02:50:24.822 --> 02:50:45.770]  Uh, because, uh, all of my people on the inside that I used to get fed all the information, uh, uh, from, uh, all my old ex-students and people who used to work for me that used to, uh, uh, cue me in, they've all died or re- or retired and disappeared.
[02:50:45.770 --> 02:50:49.692]  So, I really don't have recent information.
[02:50:49.692 --> 02:50:51.352]  Alright, Doc, stay there.
[02:50:51.352 --> 02:50:52.693]  We're gonna talk about, uh,
[02:50:54.537 --> 02:50:58.608]  X-ray lasers and more when we get back on the other side of this break.
[02:50:58.608 --> 02:50:59.110]  Stay with us.

[02:51:52.837 --> 02:51:53.157]  That's 952-442-6199.
[02:51:53.157 --> 02:51:53.598]  MyPillow.

[02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:03.842]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.842 --> 02:52:06.244]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:06.244 --> 02:52:09.467]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.467 --> 02:52:14.572]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.572 --> 02:52:18.776]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:19.076 --> 02:52:21.417]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.417 --> 02:52:24.298]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:24.298 --> 02:52:27.220]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:27.220 --> 02:52:34.823]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:35.163 --> 02:52:40.546]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.546 --> 02:52:42.867]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.867 --> 02:52:47.089]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:47.089 --> 02:52:48.169]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:48.169 --> 02:52:49.510]  You're everyone else.

[02:53:02.040 --> 02:53:05.403]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:53:05.403 --> 02:53:13.590]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:53:13.590 --> 02:53:17.153]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster.
[02:53:17.213 --> 02:53:17.793]  I don't know.
[02:53:39.448 --> 02:53:39.668]  I think?
[02:54:03.516 --> 02:54:04.777]  Dr. Bob Bowman is our guest.
[02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:15.481]  We appreciate him joining us today.
[02:54:15.481 --> 02:54:20.444]  We're going to open the phones up for Dr. Bob Bowman coming up in the next half hour.
[02:54:20.444 --> 02:54:24.206]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:24.206 --> 02:54:32.170]  You can call in about 9-11 Truth, about the Star Wars program, about the attack on Iran, whatever you wish to ask Dr. Bowman, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:37.253 --> 02:54:45.295]  Doc, I was interrupting as we went to break, bringing up x-ray lasers, other weapons systems, and you said you can speak to x-ray lasers.
[02:54:45.295 --> 02:55:02.958]  The way I saw the news describe them, one system is a nuke detonates, and there's these rods in space, that sounds pretty dangerous to the rest of the satellites and things, and then fires an incredibly high-powered array of beams through it, destroying the weapons system in the process.
[02:55:02.958 --> 02:55:05.359]  I mean, is that one facet of x-ray lasers?
[02:55:06.673 --> 02:55:16.701]  Yes, that is the original design of Edward Teller in the early 1970s.
[02:55:16.701 --> 02:55:19.943]  And he worked on it.
[02:55:19.943 --> 02:55:35.875]  There were several underground nuclear blasts that were designed to test this, to see if they could actually get an X-ray laser to work when
[02:55:36.901 --> 02:55:40.443]  Uh, pumped by a nuclear explosion.
[02:55:40.443 --> 02:55:44.524]  And they never were able to get it to work.
[02:55:44.524 --> 02:56:00.111]  And, uh, I lectured on this extensively in the early 1980s, uh, when Teller was still pushing it, uh, and had gone public with it.
[02:56:00.111 --> 02:56:05.033]  And it, uh, it is really a crazy Rube Goldberg scheme.
[02:56:06.364 --> 02:56:21.328]  And is supposed to pump these beams of x-rays out these tubes in the tiny fraction of a second before the whole thing evaporates because of the nuclear explosion.
[02:56:21.328 --> 02:56:33.172]  And those beams of x-rays have to be extremely accurately pointed because they have to be pointed at where the ballistic missiles will be
[02:56:34.426 --> 02:56:46.674]  When the x-ray beam gets there and from hundreds or perhaps even thousands of miles away.
[02:56:46.674 --> 02:56:59.243]  So we're never able to get the pointing of those long wimpy rods
[02:57:00.669 --> 02:57:02.450]  Accurate enough to do any good.
[02:57:02.450 --> 02:57:07.112]  We were never able to get the x-rays to actually lay.
[02:57:07.112 --> 02:57:12.295]  Uh, there were a whole raft of things that were just totally ridiculous.
[02:57:12.295 --> 02:57:24.781]  And, uh, uh, the early SDI program, uh, just threw that whole system away completely because it was so ludicrous.
[02:57:24.781 --> 02:57:29.083]  What about neutron bombs from space?
[02:57:29.083 --> 02:57:29.863]  Well, sure.
[02:57:30.410 --> 02:57:44.783]  I mean, you can send anything down to Earth from space, and if you guide it with GPS or something else, you can do a lot of damage.
[02:57:44.783 --> 02:57:56.654]  Of course, neutron bombs are basically people killers, where the kind of bombs from space that we study
[02:57:58.042 --> 02:58:00.784]  Uh, didn't need any explosive whatsoever.
[02:58:00.784 --> 02:58:18.558]  Uh, you know, just the impact of the, uh, uh, heavy titanium-clad depleted uranium rod, uh, would, like a meteorite, uh, do the damage without any explosive whatsoever.
[02:58:18.558 --> 02:58:20.799]  And that's mainly a decapitation weapon, correct?
[02:58:20.799 --> 02:58:23.662]  That would be good for taking out world leaders?
[02:58:23.662 --> 02:58:25.303]  World leaders and...
[02:58:25.945 --> 02:58:27.085]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:00:11.323 --> 03:00:11.403]  Yeah.
[03:00:35.254 --> 03:00:39.375]  Well, it's already the fourth and final hour.
[03:00:39.375 --> 03:00:40.716]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:00:40.716 --> 03:00:49.658]  Dr. Bob Bowman is our guest today, former head of the Star Wars program, 101 combat missions over Vietnam.
[03:00:49.658 --> 03:00:54.280]  He is a PhD in aeronautics and nuclear engineering.
[03:00:55.140 --> 03:01:01.605]  And we're always honored to have him, and we'll put his website up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:01:01.605 --> 03:01:05.428]  For radio listeners, it is ThePatriots.us.
[03:01:05.428 --> 03:01:11.752]  ThePatriots, with an S, .us, linked up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:01:11.752 --> 03:01:17.216]  Before we get back into Star Wars, we appreciate your time today, and take some phone calls.
[03:01:17.216 --> 03:01:19.658]  You alluded to the fact that you believe we're winning.
[03:01:19.898 --> 03:01:26.582]  And I remember talking to you six, seven, eight years ago, and you were a little more pessimistic, if memory serves.
[03:01:26.582 --> 03:01:35.768]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but why do you say those that want liberty and freedom and peace are starting to win?
[03:01:35.768 --> 03:01:46.715]  Well, and in that, I include we 9-11 truthers, because they are demonizing us, they're attacking us, and
[03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:49.401]  It makes a world of difference.
[03:01:49.401 --> 03:01:53.585]  It's sort of like in my congressional race, and I'm sure you remember that one.
[03:01:53.585 --> 03:01:53.985]  Yes.
[03:01:53.985 --> 03:02:10.941]  And at first, the seven-term incumbent Republican tried to ignore me, and then they came out ridiculing me as a 9-11 truth wacko, and it was only in the end
[03:02:12.329 --> 03:02:27.575]  Uh, when they got really scared that they put out enormous amounts of money onto slick brochures attacking me on every conceivable front and, you know, my name all over the place, uh, with them attacking me.
[03:02:27.575 --> 03:02:29.956]  And that was pure desperation.
[03:02:29.956 --> 03:02:39.920]  And of course, the exit polls seemed to indicate that I won that general election by 12 points, but the electronic touchscreen voting machines had it turned around.
[03:02:43.395 --> 03:02:52.977]  Obviously, their own polls showed that they were behind, and so in their desperation, they attacked me.
[03:02:52.977 --> 03:02:59.719]  Well, the same thing is happening to us patriots and 9-11 truthers today.
[03:02:59.719 --> 03:03:05.320]  They tried just ignoring us, and that worked for a while, but not for too long.
[03:03:06.022 --> 03:03:18.006]  And then they started, tried ridiculing us with all those hit pieces, National Geographic and Popular Mechanics and all that stuff.
[03:03:18.006 --> 03:03:21.987]  And that didn't shut us off.
[03:03:21.987 --> 03:03:27.169]  And we're starting to make headway into the mainstream media.
[03:03:27.169 --> 03:03:32.451]  And now they're just outright attacking us and saying that we are potential terrorists.
[03:03:33.655 --> 03:03:36.855]  And that, you know, we ought to be gunned down or locked up!
[03:03:38.584 --> 03:03:40.765]  And for those that have missed it... So I think we're winning.
[03:03:40.765 --> 03:03:41.206]  Absolutely.
[03:03:41.206 --> 03:03:44.128]  For those that have missed it, they're really saying that now.
[03:03:44.128 --> 03:03:51.793]  I mean, we're the non-violent, peaceful people exposing false flag terror that's been declassified in hundreds of cases, not just by our government, but others.
[03:03:51.793 --> 03:03:55.955]  And they're everywhere now saying that we want to assassinate Obama.
[03:03:55.955 --> 03:03:58.057]  I mean, Glenn Beck just pulls this out of the air.
[03:03:58.057 --> 03:04:04.401]  Then you have that very suspicious Pentagon event that happens after this crescendo of demonization.
[03:04:06.256 --> 03:04:20.502]  Well, you know, the people who are accusing us of those kind of things, it's a matter of projection, because if there's anybody that wants those kind of actions taken, it's them, not us.
[03:04:20.502 --> 03:04:31.527]  And personally, I'm disappointed with Obama, but I would much rather have him in there than George W. Bush, and I would
[03:04:32.779 --> 03:04:39.040]  In particular Dick Cheney, and I'd much rather have him in there, frankly, than Joe Biden.
[03:04:39.040 --> 03:04:54.803]  So, no, I put my body on the line to protect Barack Obama because he may not be doing what we need, but he at least hasn't done as bad as has been done in the past.
[03:04:54.803 --> 03:04:57.404]  So you don't think he's completely mentally ill like Cheney?
[03:04:57.404 --> 03:04:58.904]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:58.904 --> 03:04:59.324]  Stay with us.
[03:05:02.058 --> 03:05:04.981]  Max, what did you do with the remote?

[03:05:06.403 --> 03:05:08.565]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.

[03:07:01.755 --> 03:07:04.759]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:04.759 --> 03:07:10.086]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:07:10.086 --> 03:07:12.129]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:12.129 --> 03:07:17.155]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:17.155 --> 03:07:18.337]  How much do you want?
[03:07:18.337 --> 03:07:19.058]  When do you want it?
[03:07:19.438 --> 03:07:21.320]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:07:21.320 --> 03:07:22.402]  When will you need it?
[03:07:22.402 --> 03:07:24.604]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:24.604 --> 03:07:25.946]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:25.946 --> 03:07:27.468]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:27.468 --> 03:07:32.734]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:07:32.734 --> 03:07:35.858]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:36.298 --> 03:07:40.121]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:40.121 --> 03:07:41.362]  How much will you need?
[03:07:41.362 --> 03:07:42.263]  We don't know.
[03:07:42.263 --> 03:07:43.364]  How much do you want?
[03:07:43.364 --> 03:07:44.104]  All you can get.
[03:07:44.104 --> 03:07:45.385]  I'm Alex Jones.

[03:08:11.506 --> 03:08:13.087]  You want answers?
[03:08:13.087 --> 03:08:14.647]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.647 --> 03:08:18.809]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.809 --> 03:08:24.131]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.131 --> 03:08:30.834]  Every day, sometimes multiple times daily, Newsweek, Time Magazine, London Guardian, New York Times,
[03:08:32.671 --> 03:08:39.275]  Write articles saying I'm calling for violence when all we've ever done is called for peace and non-violence.
[03:08:39.275 --> 03:08:41.256]  PBS is here today.
[03:08:41.256 --> 03:08:42.217]  Nightline just called.
[03:08:42.217 --> 03:08:45.879]  They want to do an entire 8-minute profile on Alex Jones only.
[03:08:47.465 --> 03:08:56.510]  It is very creepy because I never intended 14, 15 years ago when I started getting on air to have had this big of an effect and to have learned as much as I've learned.
[03:08:56.510 --> 03:09:00.612]  But it's a testament to all of you out there what you can do if you take action.
[03:09:00.612 --> 03:09:05.054]  But I don't like to talk about myself, but I do get some concern and try to analyze this.
[03:09:05.054 --> 03:09:12.537]  Dr. Bob Bowman, what does it sound like to you that they're demonizing all of us now, claiming we're for violence, but specifically singling me out?
[03:09:12.537 --> 03:09:14.438]  I mean, you've been doing this longer than I have.
[03:09:14.438 --> 03:09:15.459]  Do you have any advice for me?
[03:09:17.088 --> 03:09:29.776]  Well, I'd say to keep doing what you're doing and be just as public as you can because the more in the public eye you are, the less they can do to you.
[03:09:29.776 --> 03:09:36.960]  The people who get picked off are usually the ones that very few people have heard of.
[03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:43.064]  And so I'd say just keep out there in the public eye and
[03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:45.261]  Give them a black eye.
[03:09:45.261 --> 03:09:46.342]  Keep doing it, Alex.
[03:09:46.342 --> 03:09:47.663]  That's all I gotta say.
[03:09:47.663 --> 03:09:48.644]  You're effective.
[03:09:48.644 --> 03:09:50.065]  You're effective.
[03:09:50.065 --> 03:09:50.465]  That's why.
[03:09:59.892 --> 03:10:14.078]  You know, I committed to this, just like you committed to telling the truth, and I passed the point of no return a long time ago, but it is creepy to have the eye of the beast looking at you.
[03:10:14.078 --> 03:10:15.818]  Oh yeah.
[03:10:15.818 --> 03:10:16.739]  Yeah.
[03:10:16.739 --> 03:10:16.939]  You know,
[03:10:17.861 --> 03:10:34.297]  I'd like to talk about, we've talked a lot about the past, I'd like to talk a little bit about the present and the near future because I'd like to talk a little about our plans for how to take back the country and
[03:10:35.225 --> 03:10:37.246]  Stop all this craziness.
[03:10:54.435 --> 03:10:58.558]  About CERN, if you think it's a danger, you gave me your answer.
[03:10:58.558 --> 03:11:04.683]  We also talked about, and you said you were aware of it, that the Air Force has talked about they're trying to develop antimatter weapons.
[03:11:04.683 --> 03:11:05.864]  I mean, isn't that dangerous?
[03:11:05.864 --> 03:11:07.825]  I mean, even the testing of those.
[03:11:07.825 --> 03:11:12.189]  Talk about CERN versus antimatter weapons.
[03:11:12.189 --> 03:11:21.896]  Okay, well, CERN, the equivalent of Brookhaven Cyclotron,
[03:11:22.543 --> 03:11:25.486]  I don't see anything nefarious about it.
[03:11:40.939 --> 03:11:49.862]  Scientific knowledge can always be used for good or evil, and all too often evil, and they're producing new scientific knowledge.
[03:11:49.862 --> 03:12:09.510]  They're also playing around a little bit with the collisions between matter and anti-matter, and that theoretically can put out an awful lot of energy, and it is dangerous, and the experiments have to be extremely carefully controlled.
[03:12:10.239 --> 03:12:26.564]  Now as far as taking antimatter and weaponizing it, I have never heard of any effort which has been anywhere near successful in making weapons out of this stuff.
[03:12:26.564 --> 03:12:34.427]  It's too hard to produce, too hard to contain.
[03:12:34.427 --> 03:12:39.729]  I don't see anything of that kind in the foreseeable future.
[03:12:41.806 --> 03:12:49.472]  But, it is dangerous from the physicists I've read, mainline physicists, that the Pentagon admits they are playing with it and trying to isolate it.
[03:12:49.472 --> 03:12:53.855]  I mean, couldn't that create potentially some type of chain reaction?
[03:12:53.855 --> 03:12:55.116]  Uh, yes.
[03:12:55.116 --> 03:12:57.458]  It is, uh, dangerous.
[03:12:57.458 --> 03:13:06.105]  And, uh, there are a lot of things that are going on that are dangerous that I have been opposed to from the beginning, like HAARP up in Alaska.
[03:13:06.105 --> 03:13:08.927]  And I've been up there to that facility, uh,
[03:13:10.607 --> 03:13:18.431]  I think it's extremely dangerous to dump huge amounts of money, I mean, of energy.
[03:13:18.431 --> 03:13:23.573]  It's money to the people who sell them the gas that they're turning into energy.
[03:13:23.573 --> 03:13:30.416]  Dumping all that energy into the stratosphere is extremely dangerous.
[03:13:30.416 --> 03:13:36.599]  They're talking about weather modification, they're talking about mind control, they're talking about all sorts of weird things.
[03:13:39.028 --> 03:13:50.293]  They don't really know what they're doing and it could have very negative consequences that they don't know how to control.
[03:13:50.293 --> 03:13:56.636]  So I have been against the HAARP facility from the beginning.
[03:13:56.636 --> 03:13:59.537]  Well here's a quick question, here's a quick example about
[03:14:00.782 --> 03:14:15.610]  Four years ago in the interviews on YouTube and Google everywhere, just Alex Jones interviews head of HAARP, we had the private PhD director, but the military runs it, and when I was contacted by HAARP and they said, you want to clear up rumors, we'll have the director on.
[03:14:15.610 --> 03:14:16.411]  I was contacted.
[03:14:17.131 --> 03:14:29.222]  And so, then it comes the day to get him on for an hour-long interview, and I've got some colonel bossing me around during the breaks, and they've got the line under their control fading him down several times.
[03:14:29.222 --> 03:14:38.470]  Then he starts talking about, we have a lot of fun, he's like a mad scientist, we can even, you know, ignite the atmosphere some nights and create artificial Aurora Borealis.
[03:14:38.470 --> 03:14:41.413]  Then they turn him down, gripe at him during the break.
[03:14:41.413 --> 03:14:42.634]  I mean, this was bizarre.
[03:14:44.435 --> 03:14:46.957]  But, I mean, it was really the director of HAARP we had on.
[03:14:46.957 --> 03:14:52.001]  Why would they contact me to come on, and then why would he then start talking about igniting the atmosphere?
[03:14:52.001 --> 03:14:55.043]  This didn't sound too safe.
[03:14:55.043 --> 03:15:03.749]  Yeah, well, uh... They've, I guess, figured that the colonels could control him.
[03:15:03.749 --> 03:15:10.954]  But, you know, when scientists start talking about their stuff, they just start blabbing a lot of times.
[03:15:12.245 --> 03:15:14.789]  And I'm sure that's what happened.
[03:15:14.789 --> 03:15:21.938]  But we're trying to infiltrate the Congress.
[03:15:21.938 --> 03:15:28.567]  We're trying to get rid of almost all the incumbents in 2008.
[03:15:31.007 --> 03:15:44.919]  We had about 30 members of our organization, the Patriots, run for Congress around the country, but they all ran as Greens or Libertarians or Independents or Write-Ins, and of course nobody got elected.
[03:15:44.919 --> 03:15:47.781]  So we're taking a different tack this time.
[03:15:47.781 --> 03:15:53.386]  We're having each of our chapters groom people within the chapter to run
[03:15:54.913 --> 03:15:57.815]  In the Democratic and Republican primaries.
[03:15:57.815 --> 03:15:57.955]  Sure.
[03:16:20.185 --> 03:16:28.167]  Okay, let's set that up, because I want to go to calls now, I promise to, and we've only got four minutes in this segment, a short five minute segment, before we let you go at the bottom of the hour.
[03:16:28.167 --> 03:16:33.048]  But give out your website one more time, where you've got more of this battle plan up there.
[03:16:33.048 --> 03:16:41.670]  Yeah, stoppatriots.us, and there's information there on what you can do to help.
[03:16:41.670 --> 03:16:46.851]  We desperately need money, we're about a million and a half dollars in debt.
[03:16:47.854 --> 03:16:50.395]  And I'm on the hook for it personally.
[03:16:50.395 --> 03:16:56.018]  We desperately need some contributions and you can do that through the net.
[03:16:56.018 --> 03:17:01.882]  The other thing is I've just published a book called A Populist Vision for America.
[03:17:01.882 --> 03:17:07.705]  And one of the chapters in that book is all about what individual citizens can do.
[03:17:07.705 --> 03:17:13.608]  So anybody who wants that book can request it.
[03:17:13.608 --> 03:17:14.928]  So get on the website.
[03:17:16.454 --> 03:17:20.437]  And next week, we'll spend an hour on solutions and the book with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[03:17:20.437 --> 03:17:23.260]  So we'll set you up for that as soon as the radio interview ends.
[03:17:23.260 --> 03:17:25.001]  Let's talk to Mark in California.
[03:17:25.001 --> 03:17:26.523]  Mark, you're on the air with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[03:17:26.523 --> 03:17:27.904]  Go ahead.
[03:17:27.904 --> 03:17:29.005]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:17:29.005 --> 03:17:29.806]  Hi, Doctor.
[03:17:29.806 --> 03:17:31.007]  How are you doing?
[03:17:31.007 --> 03:17:33.168]  Great.
[03:17:33.168 --> 03:17:35.350]  My first question was about 9-11.
[03:17:35.350 --> 03:17:41.636]  In your experience, what has been the best way of communicating the 9-11 truth to
[03:17:43.482 --> 03:17:55.291]  Friends, family members, other people that are close to you that, you know, you respect very much, but that are otherwise ignorant to the truth or are subjected to the propaganda machine and have not yet realized what's really going on.
[03:17:55.291 --> 03:17:56.632]  That's a great question, Mark.
[03:17:56.632 --> 03:17:57.172]  Thank you.
[03:17:57.172 --> 03:17:58.773]  Dr. Bob Bowman.
[03:17:58.773 --> 03:17:59.894]  Okay.
[03:17:59.894 --> 03:18:06.679]  On my website, I have a three-minute video I call the Smoking Gun Video.
[03:18:06.679 --> 03:18:08.781]  It's all about World Trade Center 7.
[03:18:09.810 --> 03:18:24.619]  I use it with friends and family, and I use it when I lobby in Congress, because you can't get a congressman to sit down for two hours and watch news change or something, but you can get him to sit down for three minutes.
[03:18:24.619 --> 03:18:38.267]  And in three minutes, they see the BBC broadcast World Trade Center 7 collapsing before it did, they see Larry Silverstein talking about pulling it, and they see the building come down from about 12 different views.
[03:18:39.504 --> 03:18:39.664]  Well...
[03:18:59.096 --> 03:19:03.337]  And I would add the caveat you have six of the ten commissioners saying it's a fraud and a cover-up.
[03:19:03.337 --> 03:19:13.540]  I have AP and Raw Story here revealed Ashcroft Tenant Rumsfeld warned 9-11 Commission about line it should not cross and told them don't investigate the attacks themselves.
[03:19:13.540 --> 03:19:24.263]  And as a former intercept pilot, I think that's some of the most convincing information when you've given your speeches in the past explaining that you were once an intercept pilot and they stood down.
[03:19:24.263 --> 03:19:25.364]  Absolutely they did.
[03:19:26.576 --> 03:19:31.259]  Hijacked airliners did not fly around for an hour and 40 minutes without being intercepted.
[03:19:31.259 --> 03:19:36.803]  And that day, 9-11, uh, was I was watching things unfold.
[03:19:36.803 --> 03:19:40.165]  I just kept saying, where are the interceptor?
[03:19:40.165 --> 03:19:46.249]  You know, it's, uh, so I knew we were being lied to from day one.
[03:19:46.249 --> 03:19:47.890]  And we got to do something about it.
[03:19:47.890 --> 03:19:54.294]  Thing is, 9-11 is extremely important because all the evils that are going on are being blamed on it.
[03:19:55.074 --> 03:20:00.816]  So we need 9-11 truth, because without it, all the evils will continue no matter what.
[03:20:00.816 --> 03:20:01.577]  Yes, got it right.
[03:20:01.577 --> 03:20:04.518]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:20:04.518 --> 03:20:08.660]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst, depression?
[03:20:08.660 --> 03:20:10.921]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:20:10.921 --> 03:20:16.103]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:20:16.103 --> 03:20:17.903]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[03:20:17.903 --> 03:20:19.464]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:20:19.464 --> 03:20:20.945]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[03:20:20.945 --> 03:20:23.986]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:20:24.306 --> 03:20:24.887]  We're good to go.
[03:20:44.182 --> 03:20:44.842]  We're good to go.
[03:21:06.749 --> 03:21:09.531]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[03:21:09.531 --> 03:21:11.392]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[03:21:30.985 --> 03:21:31.165]  I'm good.
[03:21:45.077 --> 03:21:45.778]  We're good to go.
[03:22:03.081 --> 03:22:05.582]  And we're subject to other police action.
[03:22:05.582 --> 03:22:06.823]  Tyranny is here.
[03:22:06.823 --> 03:22:10.504]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:10.504 --> 03:22:12.985]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:12.985 --> 03:22:18.867]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:22:18.867 --> 03:22:25.090]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:25.530 --> 03:22:31.515]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:22:31.515 --> 03:22:35.678]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:22:35.678 --> 03:22:39.981]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:22:39.981 --> 03:22:45.925]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:45.925 --> 03:22:49.488]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:49.488 --> 03:22:51.449]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:51.449 --> 03:22:51.910]  It's here.

[03:23:00.755 --> 03:23:04.138]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:23:04.138 --> 03:23:08.040]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[03:23:08.040 --> 03:23:11.762]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:23:11.762 --> 03:23:17.466]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove danger
[03:23:23.390 --> 03:23:23.670]  I think so.
[03:23:50.509 --> 03:23:55.653]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:23:55.653 --> 03:24:07.442]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[03:24:07.442 --> 03:24:09.263]  Final segment with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[03:24:09.263 --> 03:24:12.185]  We have a Oklahoma City survivor.
[03:24:12.185 --> 03:24:15.188]  Says she saw McVeigh and the black op teams in there planting the bombs.
[03:24:16.491 --> 03:24:18.171]  So that is coming up.
[03:24:18.171 --> 03:24:21.112]  This is right after the anniversary of that federal operation in 1995.
[03:24:21.112 --> 03:24:24.113]  They're getting ready for another one.
[03:24:24.113 --> 03:24:26.073]  Let's talk to Jim in Missouri.
[03:24:26.073 --> 03:24:26.913]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:24:26.913 --> 03:24:29.714]  Quick question for Dr. Bob Bowman, Jim.
[03:24:29.714 --> 03:24:31.234]  Hey Alex, you always seem to amaze me.
[03:24:31.234 --> 03:24:33.315]  Don't worry about it, truth will prevail.
[03:24:33.315 --> 03:24:39.456]  Hey Bowman, I got a couple questions and you can touch on what you want to touch on.
[03:24:39.456 --> 03:24:44.837]  What's the deal with the TR-3 platforms, the H-3 mining on the moon?
[03:24:46.741 --> 03:24:56.264]  And why, if you know anything, why do we have so many battleships over in the Gulf of Aden?
[03:24:56.264 --> 03:25:03.046]  Okay, well, the first two I don't have any answer for.
[03:25:03.046 --> 03:25:09.247]  We can't mine the moon until we get back there, and that's going to be a while, it looks like.
[03:25:09.247 --> 03:25:15.209]  The battleships, unfortunately, there's a lot of stuff in place.
[03:25:16.596 --> 03:25:30.966]  I understand including bunker buster bombs on Diego Garcia in preparation for an all-out attack on Iran which I hope never comes and I'm going to do everything I can to prevent.
[03:25:30.966 --> 03:25:44.154]  And they've been reporting that we've shipped the missile casings so the Israelis can put small nukes I guess they call it the mega bunker buster to use against Iran and they say oh this is the friendly nuke we're allowed to use this preemptively.
[03:25:49.347 --> 03:25:55.331]  How far do you know that as far as we've done any reverse engineering?
[03:25:55.331 --> 03:25:58.553]  Jim, he doesn't get into all the conspiracy theory stuff.
[03:25:58.553 --> 03:25:59.774]  He actually headed up Star Wars.
[03:25:59.774 --> 03:26:05.318]  We're talking about what's going on out there and what he can talk about that isn't classified.
[03:26:05.318 --> 03:26:06.859]  Might have the wrong show there.
[03:26:06.859 --> 03:26:08.200]  George in Connecticut.
[03:26:08.200 --> 03:26:09.241]  George, you're on the air.
[03:26:09.241 --> 03:26:10.601]  Welcome.
[03:26:10.601 --> 03:26:10.902]  Hi there.
[03:26:12.099 --> 03:26:16.744]  Dr. Bowman, I just want to give you a little bit of insight on the Star Wars thing.
[03:26:16.744 --> 03:26:29.176]  My mother was a double agent in Germany, undercover during World War II, and she saw the first laser, operational laser weapons being shooted down in the Allied flying things.
[03:26:29.176 --> 03:26:34.521]  She saw other types of weapons because she was well connected, and she basically debriefed
[03:26:35.543 --> 03:26:39.706]  Some of the scientists at Perkin and Elmer in Norwalk, Connecticut.
[03:26:39.706 --> 03:26:50.434]  And actually, as a kid, I saw some of the original pictures of some of these weapons when they were still classified, six months away from being declassified, and was invited to a scientific seminar.
[03:26:50.434 --> 03:26:51.875]  All right, George, that's interesting.
[03:26:51.875 --> 03:26:54.357]  You ought to call in sometime.
[03:26:54.357 --> 03:26:56.598]  What about advanced weapons platforms?
[03:26:56.598 --> 03:27:02.843]  And we know the Nazis had the jets first, and now I've seen mainstream articles claiming they had primitive A-bombs.
[03:27:02.843 --> 03:27:03.904]  Did you ever run into any of that?
[03:27:05.410 --> 03:27:07.832]  Well, I know they have the jet.
[03:27:07.832 --> 03:27:10.633]  I don't know about any A-bombs.
[03:27:10.633 --> 03:27:14.456]  Lasers, yeah.
[03:27:14.456 --> 03:27:20.380]  We have much more effective and powerful lasers now.
[03:27:20.380 --> 03:27:23.462]  But again, it depends on what you want to do with it.
[03:27:23.462 --> 03:27:26.724]  And you can knock aircraft down.
[03:27:26.724 --> 03:27:29.126]  You can do a bunch of stuff from space.
[03:27:29.126 --> 03:27:34.029]  But there's a lot of things that you still can't do with them.
[03:27:35.543 --> 03:27:44.409]  What's more effective, from your knowledge, the space-based or those big DC-10s with the big chemical lasers mounted on them, so air-to-ground or air-to-air anti-missile?
[03:27:44.409 --> 03:27:47.191]  Again, it depends on what you want to do.
[03:27:47.191 --> 03:28:00.420]  If you're trying to shoot down a missile, which is what they advertise these things for, doing it with a 747 or any of those things is absolutely crazy.
[03:28:01.286 --> 03:28:04.347]  Because they themselves are so vulnerable.
[03:28:04.347 --> 03:28:17.753]  Any country or group that has the technology to send a missile against the United States would certainly have the technology to shoot down a 747.
[03:28:17.753 --> 03:28:19.774]  And you do that first.
[03:28:19.774 --> 03:28:21.895]  It's just like in the old days.
[03:28:21.895 --> 03:28:27.317]  What they're advertising as being defensive is ridiculous because of vulnerability.
[03:28:28.208 --> 03:28:36.393]  I mean, clearly, these airborne lasers are meant for assassinations and offensive operations and killing personnel.
[03:28:36.393 --> 03:28:37.594]  Sure.
[03:28:37.594 --> 03:28:41.417]  Sure, they won't admit that, but of course they are.
[03:28:41.417 --> 03:28:53.285]  Alright, well, Dr. Bob Bowman, it's been an amazing interview, and your phone's breaking up a bit, so we're gonna let you go, but we're gonna get you set up to come on for a full hour to talk about your new book next week, here on the radio broadcast with us.
[03:28:53.285 --> 03:28:54.986]  Thank you for spending so much time with us.
[03:28:54.986 --> 03:28:56.467]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:28:57.534 --> 03:28:58.434]  We'll see you.
[03:28:58.434 --> 03:29:01.856]  Again, we'll have him with us next week on a landline, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:01.856 --> 03:29:03.477]  But I wanted to get him on as soon as possible.
[03:29:03.477 --> 03:29:06.858]  Dr. Bowman has been in and out of the hospital with cancer.
[03:29:06.858 --> 03:29:10.100]  He's going to be with doctors throughout part of this week.
[03:29:10.100 --> 03:29:13.361]  And he's a tough guy.
[03:29:13.361 --> 03:29:18.544]  And he was here last year for an interview that we put in Fall of the Republic.
[03:29:19.517 --> 03:29:19.877]  I don't
[03:29:39.773 --> 03:29:46.279]  Lady who survived the Oklahoma City bombing attack 15 years ago, joining us on the other side of this quick break.
[03:29:46.279 --> 03:29:52.045]  Don't forget, Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA premieres tomorrow at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:29:52.045 --> 03:29:55.969]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.969 --> 03:29:58.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.737 --> 03:30:11.220]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[03:30:11.220 --> 03:30:22.105]  As of January 1st, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[03:30:22.105 --> 03:30:27.527]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[03:30:28.087 --> 03:30:32.990]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[03:30:32.990 --> 03:30:42.056]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[03:30:42.056 --> 03:30:52.183]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[03:30:52.183 --> 03:30:55.846]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:30:55.846 --> 03:30:56.886]  Silverlungs.com.
[03:31:01.485 --> 03:31:02.786]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:31:02.786 --> 03:31:08.370]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:31:08.370 --> 03:31:13.393]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:31:13.393 --> 03:31:18.437]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:31:18.957 --> 03:31:24.180]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:31:24.180 --> 03:31:26.501]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:31:26.501 --> 03:31:31.304]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:31:31.304 --> 03:31:32.424]  And here's the best part.
[03:31:32.424 --> 03:31:35.466]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:31:35.466 --> 03:31:38.768]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:31:39.088 --> 03:31:42.271]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:31:42.271 --> 03:31:44.513]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[03:31:50.519 --> 03:31:58.166]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:31:58.166 --> 03:32:00.528]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[03:33:02.967 --> 03:33:08.789]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.789 --> 03:33:19.713]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:19.713 --> 03:33:23.555]  We have Jane Graham's affidavit.
[03:33:23.555 --> 03:33:27.436]  We've interviewed the former foreman of the Oklahoma City Grand Jury.
[03:33:27.436 --> 03:33:28.877]  We've interviewed police officers.
[03:33:30.183 --> 03:33:32.867]  We have a very clear picture of what happened that day.
[03:33:32.867 --> 03:33:34.769]  A very clear picture.
[03:33:35.970 --> 03:33:39.212]  And in fact, Jane, if memory serves, I've interviewed her in years.
[03:33:39.212 --> 03:33:52.361]  I remember that she even saw some of the people that she saw working in the building planting gray sticks of butter with wires, who had federal passes as maintenance people, on some of the news footage.
[03:33:52.361 --> 03:33:55.463]  And I've talked to other witnesses that said they saw those men in there.
[03:33:55.463 --> 03:33:59.985]  And then on the news, after the bomb had gone off, they'd say, well, that's him.
[03:33:59.985 --> 03:34:01.166]  Well, that's him.
[03:34:01.166 --> 03:34:04.809]  John Doe number two, Iraqis involved, all protected by the U.S.
[03:34:04.809 --> 03:34:05.189]  government.
[03:34:08.086 --> 03:34:13.589]  Jane Graham is a ninth-floor survivor of the Murrow Federal Building bombing in Oklahoma City in 1995.
[03:34:13.589 --> 03:34:18.231]  She's made a video affidavit after she watched the video cover-up in Oklahoma.
[03:34:18.231 --> 03:34:25.615]  In that video, she recognized seeing two men who were caught on camera walking hurriedly away from the building after the bombing, holding walkie-talkies.
[03:34:25.615 --> 03:34:35.501]  She says that she had noticed these men in the building prior to the bombing wearing General Services Administration maintenance uniforms that she did not recognize GSA employees.
[03:34:37.463 --> 03:34:41.185]  And we have her affidavit up on Infowars.com.
[03:34:41.185 --> 03:34:51.892]  Now there's a new article out by Red Dirt Report, a great outfit out of Oklahoma, and it boils down, again, she's one of scores of survivors and witnesses that basically tell the same story.
[03:34:52.592 --> 03:34:58.175]  Okay, and now you have Terry Nichols saying in a sworn federal affidavit that McVeigh was a black op operator.
[03:34:58.175 --> 03:35:01.416]  You have McVeigh separately saying one day it'll come out the government did this.
[03:35:01.416 --> 03:35:06.038]  The ATF 30 seconds after the bombing in full bomb gear telling medics patch me up.
[03:35:06.038 --> 03:35:07.279]  I was on the ninth floor.
[03:35:07.279 --> 03:35:08.079]  She was on the ninth floor.
[03:35:08.079 --> 03:35:09.760]  It was almost completely destroyed.
[03:35:09.760 --> 03:35:10.220]  Asinine.
[03:35:11.411 --> 03:35:25.054]  While Oklahoma and the rest of the world respectfully remember the 168 people who died in the bombing of the Alvar P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, one survivor of April 19, 1995, Blast Jane Graham, once her questions about what really happened that day answered once and for all.
[03:35:25.054 --> 03:35:39.337]  Graham, a native of Chicago, was working for HUD office on the ninth floor of the Murrah Building that morning, told Red Dirt Report that there were a lot of strange things going on in the weeks leading up to the bombing, things that she shared numerous times with federal agents, things she felt were ignored,
[03:35:40.037 --> 03:35:47.284]  This including the presence of maintenance workers who do not recognize military people in the parking garage and more unusual activity.
[03:35:47.284 --> 03:35:54.912]  But one of the key figures, the bomber himself, Tim McVeigh, was spotted in the federal building on a number of occasions and by multiple witnesses, I would add.
[03:35:54.912 --> 03:35:56.894]  It was a couple of weeks before the bombing.
[03:35:56.894 --> 03:36:00.577]  I had seen McVeigh in the building prior to the bombing around the first week of April.
[03:36:01.358 --> 03:36:07.179]  McVeigh, Graham said, rode up the elevator while she was heading to her office on that morning.
[03:36:07.179 --> 03:36:12.200]  And we have the former head of Air Force Weapons Development saying the building was blown out, not in.
[03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:14.101]  And you have the seismographs and the blast points.
[03:36:14.101 --> 03:36:15.081]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[03:36:15.081 --> 03:36:20.062]  Hoppy Heidelberg, the grand juror foreman, being threatened by the FBI and cops being killed who spoke out.
[03:36:20.062 --> 03:36:21.942]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[03:36:21.942 --> 03:36:24.043]  And I'm going to have her back up in the next few weeks for a full hour.
[03:36:24.043 --> 03:36:27.744]  She's very gracious, but I hate to even cover this without going over all the evidence.
[03:36:27.744 --> 03:36:29.344]  Let me just read a few more lines and we're going to her.
[03:36:31.258 --> 03:36:34.740]  Uh, she said, McVeigh was in military fatigues.
[03:36:34.740 --> 03:36:37.742]  I looked at him and said, hi, and he simply looked straight ahead.
[03:36:37.742 --> 03:36:39.243]  He got off the sixth floor.
[03:36:39.243 --> 03:36:42.986]  I turned to someone else in the elevator and said, well, he's certainly not very friendly.
[03:36:42.986 --> 03:36:49.330]  Another time, Graham said, he was in the elevator again and got off on the ninth floor where the Secret Service and BATF offices were located.
[03:36:49.890 --> 03:36:53.853]  Another unusual event, Graham recalled, was on Friday, April 14th, 1995.
[03:36:53.853 --> 03:36:59.456]  She had parked in the Murrah parking garage and she noticed three men standing together on the south side of the parking area.
[03:36:59.456 --> 03:37:02.258]  One of the men was holding what looked like floor plans.
[03:37:02.258 --> 03:37:09.442]  She said at first she thought about the recent phone problems that had been plugging the building and problems with gas fumes in the area.
[03:37:09.442 --> 03:37:10.843]  I watched them carefully, Graham said.
[03:37:10.843 --> 03:37:16.327]  They were standing behind a green light station wagon like an old country
[03:37:17.702 --> 03:37:19.122]  Squire wagon.
[03:37:19.122 --> 03:37:22.224]  It was filthy and I couldn't see the plate on it.
[03:37:22.224 --> 03:37:31.507]  As she watched the three men, one of whom was wearing dark clothing and two wearing short sleeves and jeans, one of the men held a stack or a roll of what appeared to be telephone wire.
[03:37:31.507 --> 03:37:32.167]  And then we'll have her...
[03:37:33.451 --> 03:37:42.698]  Finish up with what she was told, and she talked to other people, military personnel, people that said they were FBI, people she'd not seen before.
[03:37:42.698 --> 03:37:44.138]  It just goes on and on.
[03:37:44.138 --> 03:37:49.082]  People approached her, identified themselves as an FBI, wanted to know about the men.
[03:37:49.082 --> 03:37:51.183]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[03:37:51.183 --> 03:37:54.325]  And Jane Graham on record has been all over national TV.
[03:37:54.325 --> 03:37:55.646]  She was up there on the ninth floor.
[03:37:55.646 --> 03:37:57.488]  She's one of the survivors.
[03:37:57.488 --> 03:38:02.071]  And Jane Graham, we appreciate your courage, and you're speaking out again, and it's good to have you on with us.
[03:38:02.796 --> 03:38:05.762]  Thank you very much for having me.
[03:38:05.762 --> 03:38:08.748]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:38:08.748 --> 03:38:09.209]  No, no, no.
[03:38:09.209 --> 03:38:10.191]  I mean, you go ahead.
[03:38:10.191 --> 03:38:11.754]  I mean, millions are listening.
[03:38:11.754 --> 03:38:12.977]  Tell folks what really happened.
[03:38:13.658 --> 03:38:25.227]  Well, I think you've covered a lot of it, but going back to, I'll try and keep it, the most important part was the Friday before when I saw the men down below.
[03:38:25.227 --> 03:38:38.517]  I was asked about the three men, and I did tell them that they wanted to know what I thought they were, and I said, well, I would take the man in charge
[03:38:39.057 --> 03:38:42.899]  Being a surveyor and military.
[03:38:42.899 --> 03:39:05.429]  I think that was the first two things that came to my mind when I saw them and they had and I gave them a visualizing the size of the plans that I watched them which they were holding up and I was told that that is exactly the size of plans that plans are when they are in fact drawings of
[03:39:07.106 --> 03:39:08.552]  Uh, the building.
[03:39:08.552 --> 03:39:10.419]  And, uh, the garage area.
[03:39:11.611 --> 03:39:17.055]  And the third gentleman was tall, very, very nice-looking man.
[03:39:17.055 --> 03:39:18.035]  Dark hair.
[03:39:18.035 --> 03:39:21.678]  His hair came right to his collar.
[03:39:21.678 --> 03:39:25.000]  He had very dark eyes, dark hair.
[03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:30.504]  He wore a black cowboy hat with a silver trim on the hat.
[03:39:30.504 --> 03:39:35.187]  And he had black jeans, black boots, black shirt.
[03:39:35.187 --> 03:39:37.068]  And I really got a good look at him.
[03:39:37.068 --> 03:39:41.231]  He turned away from me and went to the north wall and was having a cigarette.
[03:39:42.152 --> 03:39:44.494]  And he did not want me to watch him.
[03:40:00.339 --> 03:40:05.542]  Yes, and that was who I identified later on.
[03:40:05.542 --> 03:40:22.831]  I also identified one of the men when I was finally shown some pictures, not by the FBI, not by the police, but through a private investigator who was giving me, and I identified Gary Hunt as one of the gentlemen that I saw in the building the day before.
[03:40:25.828 --> 03:40:26.068]  I think so.
[03:40:46.565 --> 03:40:58.569]  Uh, the hallway past GSA because that is an outside door there to the, uh, outside of the building on the, uh, east, east end, I mean the west end of the building.
[03:40:58.569 --> 03:41:14.954]  So, um, uh, I was very much aware of them and then I was going to go upstairs and, um, and I thought it was odd that they came down the stairwell and as I said they were going quite quickly and I was talking to somebody else
[03:41:15.700 --> 03:41:23.545]  About the fact that I had seen some maintenance men, you know, some outside maintenance men.
[03:41:23.545 --> 03:41:41.597]  And it wasn't just right after that when I was waiting at the elevator, a gentleman came up to me and said he was talking to some others and he said, I'm from the FBI and someone told me that you have seen two maintenance men.
[03:41:41.597 --> 03:41:42.158]  And I said,
[03:41:42.905 --> 03:41:52.275]  No, I didn't, and of course at that time I was thinking whether they were talking about the elevator, which we'd had a problem with, or the phone company.
[03:41:52.275 --> 03:42:03.046]  And it wasn't registering to me at all about associating them with the two GSA dressed maintenance men.
[03:42:03.607 --> 03:42:18.262]  And it was only later on, after I saw a video and saw the two of those men, I realized this is the men that they were referring to, who somebody obviously had told them, I assume it was the men that I passed, that I had seen them.
[03:42:19.162 --> 03:42:28.390]  Um, so that, I think in that in itself probably saved my life at that point because Terry Yankee had seen so much and he was killed.
[03:42:28.390 --> 03:42:33.595]  A lot of people were murdered because of what they saw or what they wrote or what they did.
[03:42:34.295 --> 03:42:36.276]  Yeah, let me stop you there.
[03:42:36.276 --> 03:42:38.396]  Terrence Yegge was cop of the year that year.
[03:42:38.396 --> 03:42:41.917]  He went in, local Oklahoma City cop, saved a bunch of people.
[03:42:41.917 --> 03:42:44.838]  And the last person he talked to was his partner.
[03:42:44.838 --> 03:42:50.100]  He'd hidden evidence of it being an inside job in a storage locker outside town.
[03:42:50.100 --> 03:42:52.340]  He'd been told to get off the case by his superiors.
[03:42:52.340 --> 03:42:55.421]  And the last phone call to his partner said, I'm being tailed by feds.
[03:42:55.421 --> 03:42:56.882]  And then he was found murdered and tortured.
[03:42:56.882 --> 03:42:58.102]  That's right.
[03:42:59.266 --> 03:43:03.168]  That is correct, and I did go.
[03:43:03.168 --> 03:43:06.771]  I wrote a letter to Stephen Jones.
[03:43:06.771 --> 03:43:09.152]  I wrote a letter to the FBI.
[03:43:09.152 --> 03:43:15.096]  I wrote one to my doctor and another person, and I told them exactly what I saw.
[03:43:15.096 --> 03:43:17.377]  I gave them descriptions of the men.
[03:43:17.377 --> 03:43:26.543]  I gave them what they were wearing, everything I could about them and what had occurred, and I never did hear
[03:43:27.754 --> 03:43:38.603]  Anything from anyone regarding, from the FBI or the police about looking at pictures of anyone, trying to identify anyone.
[03:43:39.441 --> 03:43:46.524]  And I did talk to one attorney, and he said, well, I know the sketch artists at the police.
[03:43:46.524 --> 03:43:48.365]  They're just really, really good.
[03:43:48.365 --> 03:43:49.505]  We'll get a sketch done.
[03:43:49.505 --> 03:43:50.846]  I said, fine.
[03:43:50.846 --> 03:43:52.707]  Never heard from him again after that.
[03:43:52.707 --> 03:43:53.627]  It just dropped.
[03:43:53.627 --> 03:43:55.968]  You know, that was the end of that discussion.
[03:43:55.968 --> 03:44:05.352]  I went with Debbie Nakanashi to Washington several times on this case.
[03:44:05.352 --> 03:44:07.893]  I met with one of the men who was
[03:44:09.079 --> 03:44:27.786]  On the attorney's staff there, you know, dealing with... I wanted information about, well, how does one deal with this as far as the legal aspect of the government and for review and so forth.
[03:44:27.786 --> 03:44:33.568]  And he said, well, there were only like, I think, three men that, you know, deal with a lot of these issues.
[03:44:34.255 --> 03:44:38.016]  And that really, you know, there wasn't anything that they could do.
[03:44:38.016 --> 03:44:43.478]  And I wanted, I tried to see the congressmen and senators from the state of Oklahoma.
[03:44:43.478 --> 03:44:45.838]  None of them would see me or talk to me.
[03:44:45.838 --> 03:44:53.001]  And the only person that would talk to me was James Traficant.
[03:44:53.001 --> 03:45:01.163]  And I did meet in his office, I met his assistant, and at that time he had requested from GSA all of their files.
[03:45:02.109 --> 03:45:22.954]  And the FBI had come to him and told him that they wanted to go through all of the files that he had to fight out various things that would be incriminating, and he told them they didn't have the authority to do that.
[03:45:22.954 --> 03:45:26.715]  But he would give them one day, and because he said they would not be able to do that,
[03:45:28.656 --> 03:45:34.382]  That they had threatened James Traficant and said, we will get you for this.
[03:45:34.382 --> 03:45:36.925]  You know, we're going to get you over this.
[03:45:36.925 --> 03:45:48.997]  And it's now been declassified that the current Attorney General, back at the time was the Deputy, and the memos have been released in his emails where he said we've got to have a full court press, this is like D-Day.
[03:45:50.238 --> 03:45:56.602]  We've got to get down to Oklahoma City, this is on the 16th, and cover this up or it's over for us.
[03:45:56.602 --> 03:45:59.603]  And we can even pull those emails up, I've read them on air.
[03:45:59.603 --> 03:46:04.066]  And so that clearly shows they were going into Congressman's office and saying, you shut your mouth.
[03:46:04.066 --> 03:46:07.047]  There's so much to talk to you about, Jane Graham.
[03:46:07.047 --> 03:46:15.192]  Expanding on this, what about your run-ins with Tim McVeigh in the weeks before the Alfred P. Murrow building was blown out from under you?
[03:46:15.612 --> 03:46:16.313]  Yes, yes.
[03:46:16.313 --> 03:46:17.395]  He was there.
[03:46:17.395 --> 03:46:21.460]  He was there a number of times.
[03:46:21.460 --> 03:46:25.505]  Going up, as I said, he went to the 6th floor.
[03:46:25.505 --> 03:46:28.690]  I think he even went to the 5th floor and certainly the 9th floor.
[03:46:28.690 --> 03:46:29.771]  He had gone up there
[03:46:30.825 --> 03:46:38.030]  And I really thought that he was with the military units there and going in to report.
[03:46:38.030 --> 03:46:43.774]  Or up on the ninth floor, they had ATF and other operations up there.
[03:46:43.774 --> 03:46:51.379]  And I thought, well, whatever he's doing, he's new and he's just, you know, reporting in to whatever he needed to do.
[03:46:51.379 --> 03:46:56.083]  And the comment I made about his not talking was the fact that
[03:46:57.103 --> 03:47:04.526]  Uh, everybody in that building would always be very, um, pleasant, and always friendly, and, hi, how are you?
[03:47:04.526 --> 03:47:10.048]  You know, regardless, if you didn't know them, they spoke, and he absolutely would just look straight ahead.
[03:47:10.048 --> 03:47:12.729]  Totally military.
[03:47:12.729 --> 03:47:19.171]  And also, one of the things most people do not know is that, um, uh, the
[03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:27.416]  The bomb squad had parked across in the church parking lot that morning and had their dogs out.
[03:47:27.416 --> 03:47:34.221]  And one of the postal workers, a friend of mine that went with me to Washington several times, she had seen them now.
[03:47:34.221 --> 03:47:39.545]  She was told, her job was threatened, she was told, do not discuss this with anybody.
[03:47:42.026 --> 03:47:48.850]  She went to the union in regards to that issue, and that was taken care of relatively quickly.
[03:47:48.850 --> 03:48:03.238]  But it was important because when I went up to the seventh floor, I ran into Trish Nix, who was killed in the bombing, and she said, have you seen the bomb squad?
[03:48:03.238 --> 03:48:05.159]  And I said, no, I haven't.
[03:48:05.159 --> 03:48:07.320]  And she said, well, they've been in the building.
[03:48:08.115 --> 03:48:12.137]  So I knew right then that there was something going on.
[03:48:12.137 --> 03:48:31.506]  And of course, like I said earlier, two weeks before that, when I was in the coffee shop, I was sitting at a booth and right next to me on the other booth was another lady talking to a friend of hers, telling her that she had called a friend who worked at the FBI office at 50 Penn Place and that
[03:48:32.286 --> 03:48:46.456]  Her, uh, this friend had received a fax stating that there was going to be a bombing in the federal building, and I was very, and that, not to, and she gave it to her supervisor, and he said, don't worry about it, we know about it already.
[03:48:46.456 --> 03:49:00.006]  And I was concerned because my, at that time, daughter-in-law had been working at Ballet X, which is in 50 Penn Place, and I said, oh my God, surely, when I came home, I said, surely they're not, um, not going to try and bomb 50 Penn Place.
[03:49:00.006 --> 03:49:01.407]  Of course, that's where FBI was.
[03:49:02.242 --> 03:49:07.808]  And I thought, all those people, you know, they have nothing to do with the government.
[03:49:07.808 --> 03:49:21.883]  Well, Jane, let me back you up on this, because some of this has come out in newspapers, but I have an employee whose dad was working in a federal building in Dallas, and they got that fax the day before that a federal building was going to be blown up.
[03:49:22.603 --> 03:49:29.606]  Uh, and then I know someone separately who was working at a federal building at the time, on the West Coast, who remembers those faxes coming in.
[03:49:29.606 --> 03:49:33.408]  And it's even come out in the news that there were some warnings.
[03:49:33.408 --> 03:49:36.650]  Uh, but you've got McVeigh in the building, you've got all these guys running around.
[03:49:36.650 --> 03:49:42.032]  Going back from some of your earlier video testimony, and I haven't seen it in years, but am I correct in saying you didn't just see wiring?
[03:49:42.032 --> 03:49:43.413]  You saw gray sticks of butter?
[03:49:43.413 --> 03:49:48.856]  I, I, I didn't know what it was at the time.
[03:49:48.856 --> 03:49:51.197]  I just, I thought it looked like putty.
[03:49:51.909 --> 03:49:59.475]  And I thought, uh, I didn't know what it was until someone told me, oh no, that's C4.
[03:49:59.475 --> 03:50:00.736]  That's what that looks like.
[03:50:00.736 --> 03:50:03.157]  Now who had the blocks of gray putty?
[03:50:03.157 --> 03:50:11.083]  That was the man that was with the gentleman who was holding the plans in the building.
[03:50:11.083 --> 03:50:17.908]  And so you're walking by these guys and you've never seen these maintenance crews, but they're there with wires and gray putty.
[03:50:17.908 --> 03:50:18.789]  No, no, no.
[03:50:18.789 --> 03:50:19.970]  Not the two maintenance men.
[03:50:20.509 --> 03:50:22.291]  This is separate.
[03:50:22.291 --> 03:50:26.695]  These other three men were entirely different men.
[03:50:26.695 --> 03:50:30.539]  I would have bet money on the two being military.
[03:50:30.539 --> 03:50:32.601]  Absolutely military.
[03:50:32.601 --> 03:50:36.845]  The other one, who I later identified, was Strathmire.
[03:50:38.030 --> 03:50:42.411]  But those three were different than McPherson.
[03:50:42.411 --> 03:50:43.271]  Okay, hold on.
[03:50:43.271 --> 03:50:44.451]  We've got a final segment.
[03:50:44.451 --> 03:50:48.472]  It's clear we're going to have to get you up again and really debrief you on all this.

[03:50:58.515 --> 03:50:59.515]  Who do you think's behind it?
[03:51:02.482 --> 03:51:04.223]  Oh, my sinuses!

[03:54:15.196 --> 03:54:19.978]  I was talking to Jane Graham during the break, and I said, do you see the same propaganda Clinton's saying?
[03:54:19.978 --> 03:54:23.100]  I hope there didn't have to be a terror attack to make the Tea Party shut up.
[03:54:23.100 --> 03:54:24.241]  Where do you see this going?
[03:54:24.241 --> 03:54:26.422]  And what she said was chilling.
[03:54:26.422 --> 03:54:27.363]  But finish up.
[03:54:27.363 --> 03:54:33.346]  So it was Strassmeier and the other two guys in the garage you saw with the gray sticks of putty or butter.
[03:54:33.346 --> 03:54:36.348]  Now, specifically, where do you think this is all going?
[03:54:36.348 --> 03:54:38.189]  Who do you think from the evidence was behind this?
[03:54:40.262 --> 03:54:41.103]  There are several things.
[03:54:41.103 --> 03:54:55.938]  First of all, the ATF that morning, and I think people need to understand, that morning, before the bombing, there were two men dressed with ATF Ray Jackets on, talking to a third gentleman outside in front of the Murrow building that morning.
[03:54:56.901 --> 03:55:04.764]  And, uh, I then found out you don't wear those unless there's something going down where they need to be recognizable immediately.
[03:55:04.764 --> 03:55:05.804]  That's one.
[03:55:05.804 --> 03:55:22.609]  Strathmire and the other two gentlemen that were in the garage the Friday before, yes, what I saw them have, I was told that what I thought was the putty was in fact actually what I gave a description of, and I was told that's C4.
[03:55:22.609 --> 03:55:22.789]  And, um,
[03:55:25.459 --> 03:55:52.835]  What I am saying is that if anyone goes back in history, history repeats itself always, but governments are always, one of the things they have done, they go in and they take care of creating an incident, creating a bombing or whatever, in order to come back in and fix it so that
[03:55:53.507 --> 03:56:01.229]  Whatever has happened, they've got a solution of how they're going to fix the problem, whether it be they're going to say, well, the terrorists did it.
[03:56:01.229 --> 03:56:05.269]  We now have to have additional protection.
[03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:08.750]  We need to blame it on the militia.
[03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:12.931]  We need to blame it on... We need to have a Patriot Act.
[03:56:12.931 --> 03:56:15.171]  We need gun control.
[03:56:15.171 --> 03:56:18.452]  They've always got an agenda to take away rights.
[03:56:18.952 --> 03:56:27.321]  And to sell it to the public in math as, we're protecting you, we're the good guys, we're taking care of you, we're protecting you.
[03:56:27.321 --> 03:56:35.030]  And I'm saying that this was done, they can claim, they can claim that they had no part in it.
[03:56:38.166 --> 03:56:38.366]  I don't
[03:56:52.717 --> 03:57:00.279]  They did get Strathmore out of the country with his luggage, with everything.
[03:57:00.279 --> 03:57:08.180]  A straight shot through was told by, I understand from others they were told, do not go through his luggage.
[03:57:08.180 --> 03:57:12.081]  Just give him a free pass to go back to Germany.
[03:57:12.081 --> 03:57:21.063]  There were other people who were involved and money that came from the Islam countries
[03:57:21.870 --> 03:57:22.991]  Absolutely, Jane.
[03:57:22.991 --> 03:57:26.494]  Jane, Oklahoma City bombing survivor, we're out of time.
[03:57:26.494 --> 03:57:27.095]  In closing though,
[03:57:47.043 --> 03:57:51.965]  Are you concerned seeing the same buildup of propaganda claiming domestic groups are going to attack again?
[03:57:51.965 --> 03:57:54.066]  The government's doing unpopular things.
[03:57:54.066 --> 03:57:55.787]  They need to play the part of the victim again.
[03:57:55.787 --> 03:57:58.829]  I see pre-programming for another Oklahoma City.
[03:57:58.829 --> 03:57:59.549]  Do you agree?
[03:57:59.549 --> 03:58:00.129]  Absolutely.
[03:58:00.129 --> 03:58:01.710]  I think they will do something.
[03:58:01.710 --> 03:58:03.511]  I really believe that it's not a bombing.
[03:58:03.971 --> 03:58:10.895]  It's going to be something that will have to do with water supplies or germ warfare of some sort.
[03:58:10.895 --> 03:58:31.389]  But they're planning ahead to do something big in order to blame the militias, blame the Tea Parties, because the American public is getting fed up with having their rights taken away, being taxed to death, and government is controlling everything now.
[03:58:32.236 --> 03:58:36.440]  Jane Graham, we're going to interview you again in the near future for a full hour.
[03:58:36.440 --> 03:58:37.101]  God bless you.
