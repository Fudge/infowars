[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:32.320]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen it's Monday September 19th
[00:32.320 --> 00:36.520]  I'm not Alex Jones he'll be back tomorrow this is Aaron Dyke sitting in
[00:36.520 --> 00:41.800]  but we do have a power pack show we've got Wall Street being occupied by
[00:41.800 --> 00:47.440]  protesters we've got QE3 in the works we've got Ron Paul with the really big
[00:47.440 --> 00:52.480]  straw poll win over the weekend in California and a shut down Texas straw
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.280]  poll we also have the black caucus saying they'd be in revolution if it
[00:57.280 --> 01:01.420]  weren't for Obama or marching on White House anyway and plenty of other
[01:01.420 --> 01:05.440]  stories we have lots of guests joining us today Lou Rockwell coming up in half
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.040]  an hour to talk about Ron Paul the dollar and the rest of it can Ron Paul
[01:10.040 --> 01:13.480]  win that's the question he's been dealing with he's had the interview with
[01:13.480 --> 01:18.840]  Alex Jones posted consistently for the past two weeks or so since he was on
[01:18.840 --> 01:26.760]  our nightly news TV show we also have Rizwan Sabir not sure if I'm even
[01:26.760 --> 01:29.560]  pronouncing that name right but we'll have a chance to speak with them and
[01:29.560 --> 01:34.600]  hear about how he was researching terrorism in Al Qaeda for a PhD project
[01:34.600 --> 01:40.200]  but was instead arrested and he eventually won in his appeal in court
[01:40.200 --> 01:43.840]  proceedings and was awarded money we're going to talk to him about that situation
[01:43.840 --> 01:48.240]  and the dangerous clampdown on the right to research the right to free speech and
[01:48.240 --> 01:52.480]  the rest of it and then coming up in the last hour we have Alan Watt who's one
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.480]  of the most versatile and deeply researched people I've ever spoken with
[01:56.480 --> 02:01.880]  in this community of conspiracy theorist or or what you will people who
[02:01.880 --> 02:05.360]  really just knew what was going on several years in advance who predicted
[02:05.360 --> 02:08.440]  the economic collapse and who understand the people who are really running the
[02:08.440 --> 02:17.560]  system and why these things keep happening the way they do so for right
[02:17.560 --> 02:21.280]  now we're going to talk about Ron Paul cheated out of Texas straw poll win
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.880]  congressman would have defeated governor Perry in his own state now of
[02:25.880 --> 02:31.120]  course Ron Paul won the California straw poll over the weekend with 44% I
[02:31.120 --> 02:37.840]  believe Perry was at a 29% you know Romney and Bachman were down there
[02:37.840 --> 02:42.880]  under 10% and all the other candidates were well below 2% even less than 1%
[02:42.880 --> 02:48.440]  very strong when and then we have the Texas straw poll just canceled for quote
[02:48.440 --> 02:53.720]  lack of interest is that because Ron Paul also from Texas was going to head up
[02:53.720 --> 02:56.680]  against Governor Rick Perry and it would have been embarrassing for him to lose
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.640]  well obviously that's the question Paul Joseph Watson Ron Paul is writing high
[03:01.640 --> 03:05.560]  again after his California straw poll victory yesterday but some Paul
[03:05.560 --> 03:09.440]  supporters are questioning why the Texas straw poll was canceled for lack of
[03:09.440 --> 03:13.000]  interest and whether it was actually killed because the congressman would
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.560]  have inflicted an embarrassing defeat on Governor Rick Perry in his own state
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.680]  according to a June 16 Washington Times report the Texas GOP decided to
[03:21.680 --> 03:26.080]  cancel the straw poll which was held on September 1st last year because of a
[03:26.080 --> 03:31.080]  lack of interest expressed by the candidates and due to fears the event
[03:31.080 --> 03:35.080]  would not recoup the financial outlay so there you have it even when Ron Paul
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.040]  wins he still gets censored because they just don't even take the poll he
[03:39.040 --> 03:43.400]  nearly he basically won in Iowa if you discount the fact that Bachman bought her
[03:43.400 --> 03:48.080]  votes Ron Paul was within the margin of error of winning anyway he continues to
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.480]  show extremely strongly and the mainstream media just basically won't
[03:52.480 --> 03:58.320]  acknowledge the elephant the room no pun intended with the GOP but Ron Paul of
[03:58.320 --> 04:04.160]  course the only true candidate anywhere in that mix perhaps a more important but
[04:04.160 --> 04:10.480]  far less talked about operation twist fed ready for QE3 and they've been
[04:10.480 --> 04:14.280]  quietly tacitly acknowledging that this is going to happen whether it's called
[04:14.280 --> 04:19.400]  QE3 or not but have been dallying on whether or not to actually launch a
[04:19.400 --> 04:24.560]  quantitative easing number three daily forex fundamentals written by
[04:24.560 --> 04:30.240]  Donks Bank says the FOMC will probably get QE3 rolling by the end of the year

[08:36.200 --> 08:41.400]  even on his well-deserved days off Friday on the infowars nightly news show we
[08:41.400 --> 08:46.160]  aired a special report he taped even after he had already taken off about the
[08:46.160 --> 08:52.520]  NFL pat downs the TSA style pat downs coming to NFL stadiums all of them and
[08:52.520 --> 08:57.320]  I call to boycott and no longer participate in those stadium games and
[08:57.320 --> 09:02.720]  no longer even watch it if possible just disengage Gandhi style from really
[09:02.720 --> 09:06.800]  what's a fascist overlay of bread and circuses where even the security has to
[09:06.800 --> 09:11.560]  go on there allowing the police stayed in even to the realm of distraction we're
[09:11.560 --> 09:14.840]  going to play that later in the show after we speak with Lou Rockwell so
[09:14.840 --> 09:19.680]  stay tuned for Alex Jones special report and he'll be back tomorrow but of
[09:19.680 --> 09:23.160]  course the infowars nightly news is just beginning it's getting stronger and
[09:23.160 --> 09:28.080]  stronger every week I sat in Friday when we reviewed some of the highlights from
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.320]  just our first two weeks it's incredible just how much the New World Order has
[09:32.320 --> 09:36.360]  moved down the field in that short span of time and the resistance is heating up
[09:36.360 --> 09:41.440]  to before the break we were starting to get in we were starting to get into how
[09:41.440 --> 09:46.360]  the Fed is ready for QE 3 that's Kurt Nemo from this morning we also have the
[09:46.360 --> 09:52.480]  Fed debates approach as inflation fears grow we have the EU bonds roll over debt
[09:52.480 --> 09:57.640]  with Chinese bailout we have Fed expected to launch new program while
[09:57.640 --> 10:03.520]  Europe debt troubles bubble Roubini Greece should default leave the euro is
[10:03.520 --> 10:10.280]  September 20th Greek default day and Europe digs even deeper debt hole so
[10:10.280 --> 10:14.120]  everything is happening with Greece right now and of course the Americans are
[10:14.120 --> 10:18.040]  on the hook for the bailout obviously as I said the Chinese involved as well
[10:18.040 --> 10:22.920]  but a new wave of the Great Depression the greatest recession whatever you
[10:22.920 --> 10:26.800]  choose to call it or whatever you see coming we've been predicting it for
[10:26.800 --> 10:33.960]  some time and things are just starting to hit a new plateau I believe and on the
[10:33.960 --> 10:38.760]  QE 3 matter we were discussing how following the continued deterioration
[10:38.760 --> 10:43.160]  and economic data we expect the Fed to take action in the form of a twist in
[10:43.160 --> 10:47.160]  the central banks portfolio towards longer maturity government bonds the
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.480]  Danish bank writes that is the FOMC Donsk Bank I guess unless we see
[10:53.480 --> 10:56.920]  significant improvements in economic debt over the next couple of months we
[10:56.920 --> 11:02.200]  deem it likely the Fed will initiate QE 3 buying more government bonds or
[11:02.200 --> 11:08.320]  mortgages this could happen by the end of 2011 or early next year and we don't
[11:08.320 --> 11:13.680]  even know the full implications of QE 1 or QE 2 quite yet but we know it's an
[11:13.680 --> 11:17.800]  inflationary pressure we're gonna have Lou Rockwell up in the next half hour
[11:17.800 --> 11:22.000]  just a few minutes from now and beyond Ron Paul we're gonna get into the dollar
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.800]  QE 3 and the Federal Reserve really is the biggest issue in the room right now
[11:26.800 --> 11:32.520]  shifting gears though we also have a number of activists occupying Wall Street
[11:32.520 --> 11:36.320]  I think they're in their fourth day may even be the fifth day now I'm not a
[11:36.320 --> 11:42.080]  hundred percent we've got Madison Rupert he's written no right to protest in
[11:42.080 --> 11:46.240]  America occupation of Wall Street thwarted thanks to ignorant police back
[11:46.240 --> 11:51.480]  in July adbusters began promoting a move to occupy Wall Street in protest of the
[11:51.480 --> 11:55.920]  rampant corruption market manipulation and out of control greed that's
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.440]  destroying our nation today adbusters was hoping for a turnout of some 20,000
[12:00.440 --> 12:04.840]  angry Americans would occupy Wall Street for months unfortunately the numbers
[12:04.840 --> 12:10.040]  were a 20th of that but the real story here is how the police blocked off didn't
[12:10.040 --> 12:14.240]  allow the protesters into the Wall Street area they closed off the Federal
[12:14.240 --> 12:21.080]  Reserve Bank as well we've got a report coming up from Danny Penzela true squad
[12:21.080 --> 12:25.280]  TV one of the activists there in New York he was the one who tried to occupy
[12:25.280 --> 12:30.920]  the New York Federal Reserve just a few weeks ago all by himself even and the
[12:30.920 --> 12:34.600]  police because they had read about it on Facebook showed up in force there was
[12:34.600 --> 12:39.680]  at least 40 police or so surrounding the building now there's I haven't seen all
[12:39.680 --> 12:43.040]  the footage I've seen some footage but I would imagine quite a few more police
[12:43.040 --> 12:47.760]  blocking off an entire area we're gonna play a few minutes of that report Luke
[12:47.760 --> 12:53.880]  Radowski we are changed also down there spoke with rapper Lupe fiasco on building
[12:53.880 --> 12:58.960]  seven and on the Wall Street issues he's gonna hit single asking did they
[12:58.960 --> 13:04.760]  really pull building seven we've got police block occupy Wall Street protesters
[13:04.760 --> 13:10.360]  out of agent AFP agents France press hundreds of people March Saturday near
[13:10.360 --> 13:14.080]  Wall Street New York but the city thwarted their bid to descend it to the
[13:14.080 --> 13:18.200]  heart of global finance itself to protest greed corruption and budget cuts
[13:18.200 --> 13:22.480]  so you have a first amendment right supposedly to appeal to government or
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.040]  or so forth but if you march down to the heart of the beast in Wall Street they
[13:27.040 --> 13:30.880]  don't want to hear from you the reason this is exciting even though it's a lot
[13:30.880 --> 13:34.400]  of diverse groups I don't agree necessarily with anyone solution down
[13:34.400 --> 13:38.040]  there but it's important that they're raising the questions and starting to
[13:38.040 --> 13:43.120]  appeal to the real power source not even Washington because government really
[13:43.120 --> 13:48.760]  is just a medium to go between for the power structure for the power dynamics
[13:48.760 --> 13:54.040]  and Wall Street right now and for some time has held most of that power the
[13:54.040 --> 13:57.600]  power of our numbers of being regular people in this country and our power
[13:57.600 --> 14:02.200]  through the Constitution and Bill of Rights has been significantly dwindling
[14:02.200 --> 14:06.000]  and has been steadily going down with executive orders overreach of the
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.240]  executive branch and of course these drastic monetary reforms if you can call
[14:11.240 --> 14:15.480]  them a power handover and so that's why it's interesting that ad busters who
[14:15.480 --> 14:20.600]  organized I suppose the biggest protests down on Wall Street they say they
[14:20.600 --> 14:25.000]  plan to stay potentially for months many of them wanted to camp out but as I
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.400]  mentioned police have been blocking that off but ad busters put on their
[14:28.400 --> 14:33.160]  website dear patriots rabble rousers revolutionaries thousands will occupy
[14:33.160 --> 14:38.000]  Wall Street we have our signs banners drums etc then we'll get down to
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.320]  business and hold several people's assemblies to decide what our one demand
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.960]  will be so they're trying to organize a massive protest to have only one demand
[14:46.960 --> 14:52.000]  shall we demand that President Obama reinstate Glass-Steagall Act which
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.840]  prevents you know financial houses from doing investment speculation stuff on
[14:57.840 --> 15:02.160]  top of regular commercial standard activities very important law that they
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.360]  broke apart in the 90s of course under Clinton but both sides have been
[15:06.360 --> 15:12.200]  involved and really treasurer treasury secretary Geithner a protege of Robert
[15:12.200 --> 15:17.160]  Rubin and and Summers Larry Summers is just continuing that forward and they're
[15:17.160 --> 15:20.760]  just it's just obscene what they're doing with the derivatives that would be a
[15:20.760 --> 15:25.520]  great proposal they also say outlaw flash trading impose a 1% tax on all
[15:25.520 --> 15:30.160]  financial transactions something Webster tar please proposed they say these are
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.240]  good ideas but not very energizing how about we demand the revocation of
[15:34.240 --> 15:38.320]  corporate personhood then decide that's too complicated to so instead they
[15:38.320 --> 15:43.400]  suggest we could demand Obama set up an American Democracy Reform Commission
[15:43.400 --> 15:48.800]  tasked with ending the money corporation in Washington ending the money
[15:48.800 --> 15:53.360]  corp corruption in Washington throw Obama who's a complete puppet of Wall
[15:53.360 --> 15:58.240]  Street absolute 100% puppet George W. Bush and the rest of them really have
[15:58.240 --> 16:02.440]  been almost pure puppets as well so it's just absurd of course they should push
[16:02.440 --> 16:06.560]  for reinstating Glass-Steagall that would go a very long way in repairing this
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.200]  but let's just cut now to the Danny Penzela report and find out what he saw
[16:11.200 --> 16:19.840]  down on the Wall Street occupation we have the clip yeah while he's getting
[16:19.840 --> 16:25.920]  that queued up let's just see what else is going on here this is Danny Penzela
[16:25.920 --> 16:30.400]  reporting from Wall Street with this special report for true squad TV the
[16:30.400 --> 16:32.920]  New York City Police Department has locked down Wall Street in
[16:32.920 --> 16:37.760]  anticipation of the Occupy Wall Street protests in Lower Manhattan there seems
[16:37.760 --> 16:41.440]  to be no organized structure and it's and some attendees referred to the group
[16:41.440 --> 16:45.360]  as a leaderless resistance to corporate greed a monopoly
[16:45.360 --> 17:04.040]  the protest was largely organized using social networking sites like Facebook and
[17:04.040 --> 17:09.040]  Twitter while police presence is heavy the NYPD is light on artillery there are
[17:09.040 --> 17:12.920]  no cops in riot gear or L rad crowd control weapons visible on the streets
[17:12.920 --> 17:16.680]  of the financial district the private Federal Reserve Bank of New York has
[17:16.680 --> 17:21.400]  also closed its two-story steel castle doors in preparation to keep out the
[17:21.400 --> 17:25.160]  barbarians at the gates while for the most part the protesters seem to be
[17:25.160 --> 17:29.600]  leftist communists and socialists calling for an end to capitalism there's
[17:29.600 --> 17:34.120]  also a contingent of libertarians anarcho-capitalists and volunteerists
[17:34.120 --> 17:37.920]  calling for an end to corporate fascism and crony capitalism we got some
[17:37.920 --> 17:42.400]  capitalists here I can see that we have some socialists as well I noticed that
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.560]  the people here come from so many different backgrounds I'm Trotskyist I
[17:46.560 --> 17:51.040]  see how communist I consider myself an anti-consumerist libertarian well I'm
[17:51.040 --> 17:55.240]  an anarcho-capitalist well above all else I'm a volunteer I'm a Christian I
[17:55.240 --> 17:59.240]  believe in limited government I believe in the Constitution we recognize that
[17:59.240 --> 18:03.040]  there is a problem and that is corporate influence in American policymaking that
[18:03.040 --> 18:06.960]  our government doesn't isn't owned by us anymore where we differ is the
[18:06.960 --> 18:10.240]  approaches on how to resolve that issue well we pretty much believe in a free
[18:10.240 --> 18:15.560]  market but people should choose where to live and how they live I'm against the
[18:15.560 --> 18:20.520]  system I'm against capitalism the main issue is corporate capitalism it looks
[18:20.520 --> 18:24.520]  like people either want to bring it down and restructure it or bring it down
[18:24.520 --> 18:27.760]  all together the only solution really is to bring us back to the Constitution if
[18:27.760 --> 18:32.160]  I don't think that any person who wants to overturn the system should be turned
[18:32.160 --> 18:35.640]  away anyone who believes in the revolution should be part of it and
[18:35.640 --> 18:40.560]  honestly all I see is just people that just one change in the days leading up
[18:40.560 --> 18:44.720]  to the protests the FBI distributed a memo to Wall Street businesses warning
[18:44.720 --> 18:47.680]  that the hacktivist group anonymous would be in attendance and had threatened
[18:47.680 --> 18:50.760]  to shut down Wall Street networks and that their business should take
[18:50.760 --> 18:54.760]  precautions to secure their client's data
[18:56.080 --> 18:59.840]  undercover law enforcement peppered the crowd dressed as the infamous black
[18:59.840 --> 19:05.160]  block communist group and some were Guy Fox mass the trademark of anonymous they
[19:05.160 --> 19:09.800]  walked the crowd observing and taking photos of activists cataloging the
[19:09.800 --> 19:13.600]  groups that were in attendance the undercovers are easily identifiable by
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.480]  their baggy clothes okay well we're gonna come back from that the rest of the
[19:17.480 --> 19:21.800]  report is up on info wars but as you can see the important thing is that Wall
[19:21.800 --> 19:26.000]  Street itself and the Federal Reserve issue in particular is becoming the
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.600]  issue you saw last week in the GOP debates there was a major question on
[19:30.600 --> 19:34.880]  the Federal Reserve they didn't even dare ask Ron Paul about it the cats out
[19:34.880 --> 19:38.560]  of the bag the question is are we actually going to hold them down and get
[19:38.560 --> 19:41.840]  them out of government and take our government back peacefully we'll get
[19:41.840 --> 19:45.560]  more into that we're just getting started guests coming up blue Rockwell

[23:20.360 --> 23:25.440]  naturally the leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance until

[24:50.120 --> 24:54.840]  know that it was Alex Adask and Dr. Russell Blalock are gonna be on the
[24:54.840 --> 24:59.960]  program tonight lots of Alfred Adask excuse me I think it was the first time
[24:59.960 --> 25:03.320]  he was on but very interesting guests they'll both be on the info wars nightly
[25:03.320 --> 25:07.320]  news tonight and plenty of other interesting topics we're gonna cover as
[25:07.320 --> 25:11.760]  well now as I was getting into before the break and we're gonna continue to
[25:11.760 --> 25:17.320]  bring this up with Lou Rockwell former Ron Paul campaign manager president of
[25:17.320 --> 25:22.040]  the Von Mises Institute or the Mises Institute and plenty of other credentials
[25:22.040 --> 25:25.800]  as well and that is the Federal Reserve becoming one of the prominent issues
[25:25.800 --> 25:31.360]  even in the 2012 campaign now as I mentioned before the break last week on
[25:31.360 --> 25:37.040]  the CNN GOP debate they did the Federal Reserve question would you audit it or
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.640]  what is your position on the Federal Reserve and they didn't even ask Ron
[25:41.640 --> 25:46.120]  Paul the question that's how afraid they were of giving him exposure on an issue
[25:46.120 --> 25:50.440]  he's extremely credible on has spent his entire career covering and yet we have
[25:50.440 --> 25:55.080]  marchers in the street surrounding the New York Federal Reserve and the entire
[25:55.080 --> 25:59.080]  Wall Street district really starting to put the eye of focus on that
[25:59.080 --> 26:02.360]  institution for the first time the private institution which really has our
[26:02.360 --> 26:07.680]  whole country in a stranglehold grip and is deeply involved with the European
[26:07.680 --> 26:14.880]  bailouts and all the rest of it and of course QE3 also on the horizon now we
[26:14.880 --> 26:19.760]  have support for Obama slips unease on 2012 candidates this is in the New
[26:19.760 --> 26:24.320]  York Times President Obama's support is eroding among elements of his base
[26:24.320 --> 26:28.960]  after a year-long effort to recapture the political center has failed to
[26:28.960 --> 26:33.440]  attract independent voters according to the latest New York Times CBS News poll
[26:33.440 --> 26:37.560]  leaving him vulnerable at a moment when pessimism over the country's direction is
[26:37.560 --> 26:42.120]  greater than at any other time since he took office now I've asked the guys to
[26:42.120 --> 26:45.720]  try to find this poll unfortunately I wasn't able to find it time for the
[26:45.720 --> 26:49.840]  program but it was only a few weeks ago and it wasn't just confidence in Obama
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.680]  that's slipping its overall confidence in the office of the presidency and of
[26:54.680 --> 26:59.600]  government itself I know there's been lows like 12% approval of Congress but
[26:59.600 --> 27:05.200]  you could see a chart somewhere in the mid 60s or so maybe even 70s at some
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.080]  point under President Clinton and it takes us a bit of a dive with the
[27:10.080 --> 27:16.040]  beginning of George W. Bush's presidency spike again for 9-11 and then from that
[27:16.040 --> 27:20.640]  point all the way to the end of Bush's second term a straight drop all the way
[27:20.640 --> 27:26.440]  to 7 7% approval for what I think was the office of the presidency itself and
[27:26.440 --> 27:30.640]  you could see that timed almost explicitly with the 2008 financial crash
[27:30.640 --> 27:35.920]  and then the reelection or the election rather of Obama and a new president
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.840]  only sent the spike back up halfway to about 36% approval for the whole nation
[27:40.840 --> 27:45.760]  of the whole office and of government itself and that itself has eroded all
[27:45.760 --> 27:50.200]  the way back down towards at least 11 approaching 7 and that's with all this
[27:50.200 --> 27:54.520]  new financial stuff just beginning and the point I'm trying to make is that
[27:54.520 --> 27:57.920]  it's a total loss of confidence everyone knows the woodworks are coming
[27:57.920 --> 28:02.680]  unglued this financial stuff is about to sink in big time and that's why they
[28:02.680 --> 28:06.280]  have the police stay ready to go that's why they've prepared for riots that's
[28:06.280 --> 28:09.840]  why you've seen all these white papers and studies on how to handle the
[28:09.840 --> 28:13.840]  population because things are going to come unglued they have no intention of
[28:13.840 --> 28:17.800]  fixing these things they've used the instrument of government to transfer as
[28:17.800 --> 28:22.120]  much power as possible to that Wall Street contingent which is the same
[28:22.120 --> 28:25.920]  thing as the Council on Foreign Relations contingent the Skull and Bones
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.480]  contingent the Bilderberg contingent and the rest of it now I think that was a
[28:30.480 --> 28:34.200]  presidential approval poll of course that's been slipping for Obama as well
[28:34.200 --> 28:38.760]  but obviously he's going to take a lot of blame for this economic disaster as
[28:38.760 --> 28:43.400]  he should in some ways for not fighting the system but the point is he's a
[28:43.400 --> 28:47.960]  puppet and the true financial overlords have put in their people and
[28:47.960 --> 28:52.640]  they're not changing these policies in fact as we already pointed out QE3 is
[28:52.640 --> 29:01.000]  about to start over overtly we don't yet know we've also seen Ralph Nader we
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.140]  cover this Friday on the Info Wars Nightly News show joining the left
[29:05.140 --> 29:09.040]  against Obama people who think he should be challenged in a primary of
[29:09.040 --> 29:13.720]  course he should he has no blame to the presidency we these aren't kings and
[29:13.720 --> 29:18.880]  dictators we elected them but we should send them right back out of office and
[29:18.880 --> 29:24.620]  it would only bolster the real candidates now we're gonna get all into the
[29:24.620 --> 29:28.360]  Ron Paul issue the dollar and more with Lou Rockwell coming up on the other

[33:59.320 --> 34:05.040]  your web page about how Texas just very conveniently canceled its straw poll
[34:05.040 --> 34:09.000]  because they said there was no interest in it but of course as you point out it
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.400]  was to prevent Perry from being embarrassed by having Ron smack him over
[34:12.400 --> 34:16.760]  the head and in in the state of which he's governor and I think that's
[34:16.760 --> 34:20.520]  typical of what's happening with Ron of course the establishment wants to hide
[34:20.520 --> 34:24.720]  things I this is a terrible thing to admit but I look at Politico every day
[34:24.720 --> 34:30.480]  the Politico site which is a very regime of course establishment site and one
[34:30.480 --> 34:33.760]  of the I was just interested this weekend when would they report Ron's
[34:33.760 --> 34:37.720]  amazing victory in the California straw poll and again this is a victory you
[34:37.720 --> 34:41.240]  know among people who were all officials these are not students or whatever
[34:41.240 --> 34:46.200]  and he smashed the other candidate Perry Romney of Bachman who was the they
[34:46.200 --> 34:51.040]  brought in Bachman as the keynoter and they were very very cold and standoff
[34:51.040 --> 34:55.040]  as to Ron they didn't none of the officials with the exception of one
[34:55.040 --> 34:59.120]  went to any of his receptions or they just they did of course didn't want him
[34:59.120 --> 35:02.840]  there and yet he won overwhelmingly so I was interested when would Politico
[35:02.840 --> 35:07.080]  which is the key DC political site one of what they reported what it was
[35:07.080 --> 35:11.800]  reported on Saturday was reported on Sunday last night I noticed that under
[35:11.800 --> 35:15.960]  an article that said something like why California is going to be electrically
[35:15.960 --> 35:19.800]  insignificant because you know that the date of the primary or whatever there
[35:19.800 --> 35:23.600]  was a little tiny sub in a micro sub under there about Ron winning the
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.160]  California primary on this same page they still had a major headline about
[35:28.160 --> 35:32.000]  Santorum having won the Pennsylvania straw poll his own state of course a
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.560]  week ago so they still had that up a week later and they just put you know so
[35:36.560 --> 35:40.480]  there's that's typical but you know I think that it hurts them doesn't hurt
[35:40.480 --> 35:44.880]  Ron because all his people know first of all nobody who's a Ron Paul supporter
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.320]  is going to Politico to find out what's going on we just want to see maybe
[35:48.320 --> 35:51.560]  what the what the establishment is saying but we're not particularly not
[35:51.560 --> 35:56.520]  looking for news but I think that the whole blackout of Ron all that stuff
[35:56.520 --> 36:00.240]  rebounded on them hurt them because of course no regular American trust the
[36:00.240 --> 36:05.120]  mainstream media I don't care what your political orientation is or even if you
[36:05.120 --> 36:08.640]  don't have a political orientation we none of it we have a doll have a
[36:08.640 --> 36:14.600]  distance and just an instinctual dislike of the networks the three government
[36:14.600 --> 36:19.000]  networks that were set up you know after World War two and the rest of the
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.080]  mainstream media we know that they're a bunch of liars and the stenographers for
[36:24.080 --> 36:29.200]  the government so the fact that they don't like Ron Paul is actually actually
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.040]  a good thing because it just stimulates his followers stimulates his donors he
[36:33.040 --> 36:37.680]  just raised another million dollars this weekend from from regular Americans
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.000]  average donation of about fifty six dollars and that's just that's the way
[36:42.000 --> 36:48.040]  his fundraising goes he's regular people support it it's not the not the war and
[36:48.040 --> 36:51.480]  buffets of the world in fact they of course want to do anything they can to
[36:51.480 --> 36:56.280]  prevent Ron Paul from from doing well but he is doing well he's doing you know
[36:56.280 --> 37:00.640]  he keeps moving up in the polls and I I I always think even though I'm
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.560]  fascinated by the polls I always like to put in my my political blog on the
[37:05.560 --> 37:10.120]  rockwell.com I always like to report what the polls say but I'm also aware that
[37:10.120 --> 37:14.200]  you can't really trust the polls and one thing that always sticks in my head is
[37:14.200 --> 37:22.040]  that in the run-up to World War two what we now know that both Gallup and the
[37:22.040 --> 37:26.120]  other major polls cooperated with the Roosevelt administration to fake their
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.200]  results so that it seemed like gradually over time more and more Americans were
[37:31.200 --> 37:35.000]  forgetting into World War two in fact that was a lie virtually nobody was
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.960]  forgetting into World War two until of course Roosevelt's event at Pearl Harbor
[37:38.960 --> 37:46.040]  happened so sometimes pollsters in cahoots with the government lie so is
[37:46.040 --> 37:48.760]  that happening now you know I don't know but it's always sort of niggling in the
[37:48.760 --> 37:52.400]  back of my head but even among these polls Ron is doing better and better he
[37:52.400 --> 37:56.400]  of course they keep trying to say he's not top tier and Bachman and Huntsman are
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.760]  top tier Bachman who's way below Ron maybe getting half his support according
[38:00.760 --> 38:04.280]  to these polls and Huntsman of course who barely you know registers a pulse on
[38:04.280 --> 38:08.560]  these polls just because he's the son of a billionaire and he's a established my
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.600]  guy he's considered top tier but they can't you know all that though that can
[38:12.600 --> 38:16.880]  the kind of description of calling Ron not in the top tier just outrageous his
[38:16.880 --> 38:20.680]  supporters makes them want to work harder and doesn't have any effect against
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.960]  them so it's quite extraordinary he's coming in of course third even in these
[38:24.960 --> 38:31.840]  polls the national and state level polls quite quite exciting to see it's
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.320]  it's like his all the work he did four years ago and of course all the
[38:36.320 --> 38:41.240]  work he's been doing for decades and speaking out against the banksters and
[38:41.240 --> 38:45.960]  big government and the wars and all the rest of the depredation that Washington
[38:45.960 --> 38:51.560]  DC visits on us he's built up a huge amount of credibility but I don't think
[38:51.560 --> 38:55.120]  it's ever been anybody in American politics like Ron Paul maybe politics
[38:55.120 --> 38:59.440]  anywhere like Ron Paul so he has this huge credibility he's sort of the
[38:59.440 --> 39:03.200]  opposite of the MSM or any other politician people actually believe him
[39:03.200 --> 39:06.880]  they actually believe he speaks the truth and of course he does speak the
[39:06.880 --> 39:12.320]  truth he always speaks his mind and you know everybody everybody loves that so
[39:12.320 --> 39:18.440]  it's well he predicted all of this economic stuff coming down even to the
[39:18.440 --> 39:23.760]  point where it would bolster his own popularity in 2012 race and now we see
[39:23.760 --> 39:27.160]  the Federal Reserve emerging as a serious issue they asked about it at the
[39:27.160 --> 39:31.360]  CNN debates some of the candidates said yeah they would audit it but they kind
[39:31.360 --> 39:35.440]  of wouldn't even consider reforming the system itself meanwhile the beast is
[39:35.440 --> 39:40.240]  totally unleashed it's consuming Europe through the bailout process and all the
[39:40.240 --> 39:44.200]  rest of it there's no sign of stopping how significant is it that the Federal
[39:44.200 --> 39:47.680]  Reserve has become a well-known term to the American public and that is
[39:47.680 --> 39:51.960]  becoming a campaign issue Aaron astounding I've been interested in the
[39:51.960 --> 39:55.360]  Fed for a very long time I could remember writing and talking about it in the
[39:55.360 --> 40:00.360]  1960s and I could tell you nobody was interested economists were interested
[40:00.360 --> 40:04.160]  nobody else was interested with their just their eyes would glaze over Ron
[40:04.160 --> 40:08.920]  Paul building on the great Austrian economist visas that Rothbard sent
[40:08.920 --> 40:16.000]  hopes I act and so forth has made this a popular issue and of course there's
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.760]  been you know as Rothbard always would like to point out it's not enough to
[40:19.760 --> 40:25.280]  explain economic error you also have to show that they're ripping you off so
[40:25.280 --> 40:28.960]  that's what Ron Paul has done with the Fed he's made Americans understand this
[40:28.960 --> 40:33.200]  is not just a mistake some institution in Washington is making they are ripping
[40:33.200 --> 40:36.800]  off the average person not only here but around the world for the benefit of
[40:36.800 --> 40:41.040]  the big banks everything that's happening in Europe and of course now it's
[40:41.040 --> 40:44.360]  open that Fed is the Fed is going to bail out the European banks and the
[40:44.360 --> 40:48.720]  European governments which are in a hawk to the banks everything happening in
[40:48.720 --> 40:52.400]  Europe has to do with the banks just like it does here we all live in a bank
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.760] ocracy so Ron Paul has made that an issue and of course once people begin to
[40:56.760 --> 41:00.320]  understand that this is morally no different from a counterfeiting
[41:00.320 --> 41:04.280]  operation only far more damaging than a local counterfeiting operation I
[41:04.280 --> 41:09.800]  thought I realized that this is really a criminal enterprise set up by the big
[41:09.800 --> 41:15.280]  banks back in 1910 the Rockefellers the Morgan and so forth they
[41:15.280 --> 41:19.680]  brought the Federal Reserve Act and it was passed under under the evil Woodrow
[41:19.680 --> 41:25.120]  Wilson and has caused endless trouble when Ron Paul first decided to become a
[41:25.120 --> 41:30.920]  public figure and to give up his medical is very successful medical practice it
[41:30.920 --> 41:35.600]  was Nixon's closing of the gold window which was the cutting of the final time
[41:35.600 --> 41:39.400]  between the dollar and gold since that time the Federal Reserve has been a
[41:39.400 --> 41:42.640]  hundred percent a discretionary institution they just print as much
[41:42.640 --> 41:46.920]  money as they want there's no limit on them and Ron as Ron said right then he
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.040]  said this is going to make sure that average Americans are not going to see
[41:51.040 --> 41:54.320]  you know their standard of living is going to be harmed for the benefit of
[41:54.320 --> 41:58.920]  the big interests and of course that's exactly what happened in fact really the
[41:58.920 --> 42:03.520]  average American family has not seen an increase in its standard of living since
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.640]  Nixon did that yes we have wonderful you know wonderful gadgets we have the
[42:08.640 --> 42:14.280]  internet we have our computers and iPads iPods I love all that stuff myself but
[42:14.280 --> 42:19.000]  the average the average family's standard of living is not improved I don't
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.320]  care what the government statistics are in terms of what you actually have
[42:22.320 --> 42:28.120]  after taxes in the stand in the current dollars to spend on your family to put
[42:28.120 --> 42:31.600]  away for savings or whatever else it's no different than it was in the early
[42:31.600 --> 42:36.000]  1970s that is the criminal act and of course it's an act of theft this is not
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.200]  just a mistake it's the it's a theft a gigantic theft the biggest theft in the
[42:40.200 --> 42:43.960]  history of the world as a matter of fact engineered by the Federal Reserve for the
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.320]  big banks and for the government and for the other big government contractors
[42:47.320 --> 42:51.800]  also the military industrial complex the medical industrial complex big pharma and
[42:51.800 --> 42:55.760]  so forth all these people of course are all at the on the gravy train they're
[42:55.760 --> 43:00.320]  all feeding at the trough and the while the average guy is being strangled and
[43:00.320 --> 43:05.720]  forced to give up his few bucks to feed to these people so Ron Paul has made this
[43:05.720 --> 43:11.920]  a tremendous issue and I I'll never forget more than four years ago when he
[43:11.920 --> 43:16.240]  spoke at the University of Michigan after the Michigan debate when he said
[43:16.240 --> 43:20.000]  what was coming economically that we were we were having entering a very serious
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.400]  recession indeed had already entered it all the other Republican
[43:24.400 --> 43:27.160]  candidates McCain and all the rest of these creeps said well that's for a
[43:27.160 --> 43:31.320]  different huckabee and so forth that's ridiculous Bush is great the economy is
[43:31.320 --> 43:35.600]  great how dare you you know take a Democratic line which was their their
[43:35.600 --> 43:39.640]  line and criticize our wonderful president his management of the economy so
[43:39.640 --> 43:43.800]  after this run went to the University of Michigan a very liberal campus and he
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.760]  spoke to 4,000 students came out into the quad here and very unusual for
[43:48.760 --> 43:53.520]  college students to come out and hear somebody 4,000 kids and as he's speaking
[43:53.520 --> 43:56.800]  to them and they're cheering him about foreign policy and everything but when
[43:56.800 --> 44:03.040]  he started talking about money and the central bank these kids started chanting
[44:03.040 --> 44:08.920]  and the Fed and the Fed and the Fed and that's where Ron got that slogan came
[44:08.920 --> 44:12.560]  from the students and some of them started holding up dollar bills that
[44:12.560 --> 44:16.440]  they had lit on fire that they give a message to Bernanke and there was a
[44:16.440 --> 44:19.280]  great you know it was a tremendous moment I believe a moment that will be
[44:19.280 --> 44:23.640]  looked back upon by future historians as a real turning point of this country
[44:23.640 --> 44:28.400]  yeah it's amazing and then we have Rick Perry writing a book also picking up on
[44:28.400 --> 44:33.960]  the Fed slogan fed up rather than end the Fed and other things it's just it's
[44:33.960 --> 44:38.000]  really strange to see how they try to co-oper on even as he has complete
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.560]  success with the people but the other thing is I caught most of his speech
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.280]  from the California straw poll and he's not only talking about money and ending
[44:46.280 --> 44:50.720]  the Federal Reserve but tying it all into a natural rights issue along with
[44:50.720 --> 44:55.480]  police shutting down lemonade stands along with police not allowing people to
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.600]  sell raw eggs or raw milk and and so forth where do you where do you see
[44:59.600 --> 45:03.640]  things going on that front well you know of course Ron always talks about how
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.680]  freedom unites us because maybe we don't agree with the next guy and every
[45:07.680 --> 45:12.640]  and every point but we want freedom for the issues we care about and there are
[45:12.640 --> 45:16.600]  people who care about healthy food they care about being able to have raw milk
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.720]  and have access to something other than foods that are manufactured by the big
[45:20.720 --> 45:24.360]  companies and league with the federal government and these sometimes people are
[45:24.360 --> 45:27.400]  not libertarian though I think that they're increasingly becoming libertarians
[45:27.400 --> 45:31.400]  but we're so Ron Paul attracts the support of everybody whether they're
[45:31.400 --> 45:38.160]  quote left or quote right because they were we all want freedom and as he says
[45:38.160 --> 45:43.360]  it unites us so I think the food issue is extremely important when that you
[45:43.360 --> 45:46.240]  know when that when there was a recent and because you guys reported on this too
[45:46.240 --> 45:52.160]  when there was a recent SWAT team attack on an Amish farmer for selling raw
[45:52.160 --> 45:56.320]  milk to willing buyers that's something out of the Soviet Union and Nazi
[45:56.320 --> 46:00.280]  Germany and in fact of course that's already we live in a fascist state in
[46:00.280 --> 46:04.880]  this country we've had that we've had a fascist economy of at least a
[46:04.880 --> 46:10.000]  Mussolini sort really ever since Franklin Roosevelt socialism was really
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.560]  never of the danger here fascism has been the danger of course we live under a
[46:13.560 --> 46:18.880]  fascist government of big corporations and big government ruling the rest of
[46:18.880 --> 46:23.200]  us and cahoots ripping us off well they built up a big government system and
[46:23.200 --> 46:26.640]  then rerouting the beneficiaries straight to Wall Street and the rest of the
[46:26.640 --> 46:29.840]  corporations well of course it was all was that I mean Franklin Roosevelt for
[46:29.840 --> 46:33.200]  example started Social Security for the same reason the Bismarck started Social
[46:33.200 --> 46:37.360]  Security to try to fool regular people into thinking that you know the
[46:37.360 --> 46:41.080]  government was on their side meanwhile they're picking their pockets and
[46:41.080 --> 46:46.320]  strangling their lives and their families and so forth so it's always
[46:46.320 --> 46:52.160]  been always been a ripoff for the big guys I mean why would anybody think it's
[46:52.160 --> 46:55.560]  otherwise I mean are we really supposed to think that regular people have the
[46:55.560 --> 46:59.120]  influence that George Soros or Warren Buffett or the rest of these creeps
[46:59.120 --> 47:04.040]  have I mean it's like a naive view of democracy in fact I would argue that the
[47:04.040 --> 47:08.480]  great achievement of democracy from the standpoint of the regime is that it
[47:08.480 --> 47:12.760]  disguises you know makes everybody so that Americans so naively and I would
[47:12.760 --> 47:18.440]  argue stupidly refer to the government as we should we invade Libya should we
[47:18.440 --> 47:22.800]  go to the moon should we you know it's not we the government is a separate
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.040]  entity it's a parasite that lives off society it's the most dangerous parasite
[47:27.040 --> 47:31.000]  in the world for the US government is the biggest richest most powerful
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.200]  government ever to exist by many magnitudes and it's killed millions of
[47:36.200 --> 47:41.040]  people it has no hesitation and shutting down a little girls lemonade stand
[47:41.040 --> 47:48.640]  feeling up people at the airports which by the way they do to make us to
[47:48.640 --> 47:52.400]  humiliate us then to make us feel that we have no control we have to do whatever
[47:52.400 --> 47:56.200]  they say that is the purpose of the Philips at the airport has nothing to do
[47:56.200 --> 48:01.200]  with quote-unquote security and in fact I tend to think the whole war on terror
[48:01.200 --> 48:06.520]  has it so as you guys do has it the chimerical aspect to it but that's not
[48:06.520 --> 48:11.240]  it's not because they're afraid of some air or swore the Arab guy coming in it's
[48:11.240 --> 48:17.160]  to oppress control humiliate us and even taking off your shoes is an old
[48:17.160 --> 48:20.560]  technique from the CIA interrogation manual it humiliates somebody take your
[48:20.560 --> 48:24.440]  shoes off to be in your bare feet so that's why they do it it's not because
[48:24.440 --> 48:27.720]  you know no other country in the world makes people take their shoes off I
[48:27.720 --> 48:33.320]  mean it's just it's just it's our enemy the state that Washington DC forget
[48:33.320 --> 48:38.040]  bin Laden or all the rest of these guys the enemy is in Washington and you know
[48:38.040 --> 48:44.960]  run that's why Ron Paul runs not for glory not for power not for control he
[48:44.960 --> 48:49.640]  runs to dismantle the apparatus in Washington he wants to stop the wars
[48:49.640 --> 48:53.960]  stop the counterfeiting of the fed stop the ripoffs for the big banks of the
[48:53.960 --> 48:58.160]  big corporation stop the ripoffs for big pharma allow people to have the bite of
[48:58.160 --> 49:01.600]  just to take one issue that he introduced the bill about today allow
[49:01.600 --> 49:05.520]  people to take the vitamins and minerals they want the FDA which is a an
[49:05.520 --> 49:08.960]  adjunct with the big pharmaceutical companies is on another tear about you
[49:08.960 --> 49:12.880]  know outlawing or at least making us go pay some ripoff price to a doctor
[49:12.880 --> 49:16.880]  government-approved doctor to be able to get vitamins and minerals we want what
[49:16.880 --> 49:22.120]  an outrage I mean again this is you know Nazi or Soviet kind of stuff and so
[49:22.120 --> 49:26.040]  we're living in a very dangerous time on the other hand there's more and more
[49:26.040 --> 49:29.720]  opposition from the American people and of course Ron Paul is gathering that
[49:29.720 --> 49:35.840]  opposition focusing it and scaring the pants off the establishment so it's
[49:35.840 --> 49:42.680]  very exciting and we have I would say even more exciting times ahead well
[49:42.680 --> 49:45.280]  we're coming up on the break right now we'll have more with you on the other
[49:45.280 --> 49:50.400]  side but where do you see this going as the NFL starts to adopt patdowns as we
[49:50.400 --> 49:54.520]  see bus and train stations patting people down as we see shopping centers
[49:54.520 --> 49:58.080]  starting to get ready for TSA style security what does that say about the
[49:58.080 --> 50:01.640]  fascist government and how do we say no when the people have already said no to
[50:01.640 --> 50:07.760]  the TSA well it's you know it's very ominous and of course if they if the
[50:07.760 --> 50:11.320]  whole terrorist threat were exact what they say it was long ago somebody would
[50:11.320 --> 50:14.760]  have blown up a mall or a ticket counter at an airport or whatever whether
[50:14.760 --> 50:19.840]  there's no number this is all designed to you know make us the cattle the cash

[54:22.120 --> 54:25.760]  Alex the show is just beginning but we're in our last segment here with Lou
[54:25.760 --> 54:30.480]  Rockwell of Lou Rockwell dot com talking about all things politics all things the
[54:30.480 --> 54:34.640]  dollar all things the Federal Reserve and before we get more into the dollar
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.800]  and the quantitative easing Lou I wanted to ask you this how can Ron have the most
[54:39.800 --> 54:44.640]  positive effect we know you and Alex have discussed can Ron Paul win and of
[54:44.640 --> 54:48.440]  course if it weren't a rig game easily even with the rig game he's still
[54:48.440 --> 54:51.880]  dominating all these polls we don't know yet what's going to happen once it
[54:51.880 --> 54:56.080]  moves into actual elections but he's raised the Federal Reserve issue made a
[54:56.080 --> 55:01.400]  lot of headway on that been campaigning nationally since at least 2007 on the
[55:01.400 --> 55:05.560]  economic issue he's gained so much credibility and meanwhile we have Obama
[55:05.560 --> 55:10.640]  being undermined from the left from the anti-war contingent even the black
[55:10.640 --> 55:13.800]  caucus says they're fed up and they'd be marching on the White House if it
[55:13.800 --> 55:17.960]  weren't for the fact that they simply sort of identify with Obama but why
[55:17.960 --> 55:22.600]  identify with the puppet when the whole system is ruined Lou and how can a Ron
[55:22.600 --> 55:26.880]  Paul let the world know he's got the answers and the rest are just part of
[55:26.880 --> 55:32.120]  the same system you know I think here's the conundrum Ron of course as you say
[55:32.120 --> 55:37.120]  has immense believability on the economy not only because he not only
[55:37.120 --> 55:41.200]  because he's a genius by the way and and and a great economist even though he
[55:41.200 --> 55:45.560]  doesn't have his degrees in medicine versus economics he is a real
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.200]  economist and he can speak with such authority and such truth and of course
[55:50.200 --> 55:53.840]  he predicted everything so this is this is his strength on the other hand the
[55:53.840 --> 55:58.360]  Republican Party is a party of what thirsty murderer cheerer cheer cheer
[55:58.360 --> 56:01.560]  leaders I mean people the kind of people who sat in the Roman Coliseum and
[56:01.560 --> 56:05.400]  cheered the gladiators placing each other up so that's I'm gonna say that's
[56:05.400 --> 56:09.360]  the way I think of most Republicans in effect most Tea Party people so here's
[56:09.360 --> 56:16.080]  the question can people's concern about the economy fear about the economy all
[56:16.080 --> 56:19.960]  realized instinctively we're in a depression that our kids and our grand
[56:19.960 --> 56:23.720]  kids are gonna be worse off than we are so if people will put that first and I
[56:23.720 --> 56:28.080]  think I think this is very doable because not only because of Ron's a
[56:28.080 --> 56:31.320]  tremendous stature but because of what the government keeps doing to the
[56:31.320 --> 56:35.280]  economy in the feather making us poorer and poorer so I think it's a race it's
[56:35.280 --> 56:39.800]  a race will these guys you know these people are not going to agree with Jesus
[56:39.800 --> 56:43.040]  Christ that blessed are the peacemakers I don't I don't see especially the
[56:43.040 --> 56:46.680]  Christian right and so well I don't see that happening but will they put that at
[56:46.680 --> 56:50.640]  a second issue and not worry about America dominating the globe and running
[56:50.640 --> 56:54.920]  every country and killing people by the carload will they put their desire for
[56:54.920 --> 56:59.160]  that kind of killing all Muslims and so forth will they put their desire for for
[56:59.160 --> 57:04.600]  blood below their desire to have some kind of standard of living for themselves
[57:04.600 --> 57:09.240]  and their family I think that that is the key of Ron is capable of doing it but
[57:09.240 --> 57:15.040]  the unfortunate ally he's got in this is how the government is is stamping on
[57:15.040 --> 57:19.120]  the economy more they talk about rating out what we're already exactly in the
[57:19.120 --> 57:23.840]  situation that was true in the 1930s professor Robert Higgs talks about this
[57:23.840 --> 57:29.200]  what was called regime uncertainty people stopped investing businessmen stop
[57:29.200 --> 57:31.800]  hiring because they never knew what Roosevelt was going to do was he going
[57:31.800 --> 57:35.880]  to just be like a communist and confiscate everything or like well you
[57:35.880 --> 57:39.080]  know like Hitler or whatever nobody knew what he was going to do and it was
[57:39.080 --> 57:42.240]  until after the war that the economy came back with a bang by the way when
[57:42.240 --> 57:45.480]  the government was drastically cut military spending was drastically cut
[57:45.480 --> 57:50.200]  and in 1946 we had the greatest year of economic growth in American history by
[57:50.200 --> 57:55.600]  far 30% economic growth in one year probably that understates an
[57:55.600 --> 58:00.200]  unbelievable explosion of prosperity so that's what can happen we're not we
[58:00.200 --> 58:04.880]  don't have to be sentenced to poverty we don't have to be sentenced to having
[58:04.880 --> 58:08.400]  our kids worrying about what's going to happen to our kids and our grandkids and
[58:08.400 --> 58:13.360]  great-grandkids so forth so you know is because the economy is getting worse
[58:13.360 --> 58:17.840]  Ron Paul not only can has the diagnosis about when what went wrong he's got the
[58:17.840 --> 58:23.120]  cure so that is that that is I think where possible victory lies we just have
[58:23.120 --> 58:26.560]  to see if we can all help them bring that about okay we're coming up on the
[58:26.560 --> 58:30.720]  break thank you so much for joining us Lou Rockwell dot-com lots of great

[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:43.800]  Alex Jones
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.880]  we're back it's the second hour it's Monday September 19th I'm Aaron Dyke
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:54.000]  sitting in for Alex Jones he'll be back tomorrow and tonight on the Info Wars
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.240]  nightly news I didn't do a clean read of the guests I want to make sure people
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:03.280]  know we have Dr. Russell Blalock coming up he's going to talk about vaccines the
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:07.200]  garter cell issue and so much more he's such an interesting guy we interviewed
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.680]  him about a year ago during a conference out in Las Vegas really just in-depth
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.720]  topics you've seen it on Prison Planet TV but if you're not a subscriber you
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.280]  want to become a part of the Info Wars nightly news it's going to be an
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.640]  incredible production it is still just getting started and the production
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.280]  values great now but it's going to be getting even better we've hired three
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:33.360]  new reporters just in the last month and a half dedicated almost exclusively to
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.920]  the Info Wars nightly news we've been building our infrastructure getting
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:41.000]  everything reinforced and ready to go and we're about to hire even new
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.600]  reporters to just bring you the most condensed and informative news
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.080]  broadcasts we can we just want to make it really strong and we need your support
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.360]  to do that because we are of course not corporate backed we don't have bailout
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.040]  money we don't have big conglomerates funding this thing it's just the
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.200]  listeners that's you people and so if you're watching and spreading the
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.840]  information that's great but if you're in a position to help us financially that
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.760]  helps tremendously as well it's hard to make ends meet especially as the
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.320]  economy continues to head downwards and we need that support as much as anyone
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.200]  else and that's why Alex has been really making this appeal to you but we also
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.760]  have Alfred Adas coming up he's going to be talking about the IRS liberty
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.680]  corporate tyranny and he was talking so much about natural rights and how the
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:33.040]  system itself legally regards us as an animal and it's very interesting how
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.560]  much that ties into the history of psychology from Hegel onwards and the
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:42.120]  way they developed that into education I'll Charlotte Isherby I'm sure she'll
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.280]  be on the show sometimes soon as well now tonight on the infowars nightly news
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.000]  we're also going to cover Ron Paul's emerging victory that is if you read the
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.200]  true polls and really grasp the issues he's the clear victor we're going to
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.360]  cover even more in depth on the NFL we're hoping there's been a poll in USA
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.480]  today where people are clearly against it but I wouldn't exactly expect a
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:08.480]  downturn at the games but there should be Alex's asked people to protest and to
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.720]  boycott the NFL we're going to get into that special report at at the end of this
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.920]  next segment and we're also going to cover the Gardasil issue which is just
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.360]  exploding and and you've probably seen that clip if you've been a long-time
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:25.400]  listener if you're a new listener maybe we should play that sometime today or if
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.240]  not we'll play it later on the show or something where the Merck scientists
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:34.400]  just laughs about putting cancer vaccines SB 40 all the stuff into the
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:38.800]  vaccines for decades and and you know it's a mystery why is there so much

[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.840]  special report here in just a few moments calling for a boycott of the NFL and a
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:40.920]  disengagement from this police state system they are clamping down all
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.360]  around us it's absolutely absurd the people have already spoken out against
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:51.320]  the TSA and said no to Pat down said no to total invasion of privacy total
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.880]  disregard for the Fourth Amendment and all the rest of it and yet we've known
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:01.720]  for a year and a half at least that the Homeland Security has plans to slowly
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.840]  but surely and not really that slowly even integrate these TSA style Pat
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.400]  downs everywhere in our society they talked about using cameras they could
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.360]  see under pedestrians clothes there's highway checkpoints they've already
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:21.480]  started a semi-random train station pat downs and security checks bus stations
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.160]  as well we've seen news clips of and now the NFL being the uh what Lou row Lou
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.840]  Rockwell would call a fascist integration of the government and I tend to
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.760]  agree is adopting this boycott I'm sorry they're adopting the pat down
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:41.080]  procedures after a man waved around a taser and everyone freaked out as if
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.720]  that's not a pretext that we could see coming and so we're gonna play that
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.920]  clip but just a moment Alex a special report from Friday still fresh though
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.640]  because I haven't seen anyone in the mainstream media say no other than the
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:58.600]  poll which I hope they'll bring me soon showing that very few people support
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.120]  these measures although how many of them are actually going to the games we have
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:08.440]  yet to see but ankle down ankle to waste pat downs and waste up pat downs now at
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:14.200]  all 32 NFL stadiums just absolutely discussing I know we're covering that on
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:19.000]  the nightly news tonight as well meanwhile Obama plans to tax the rich I
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.160]  guess that's how they plan to raise the 1.5 trillion their little Super
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.000]  Congress committee was supposedly going to deal with higher taxes of course
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.760]  squeezing out the middle class and further clamping down on the economy as a
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.360]  whole and as I mentioned with Lou Rockwell the Black Caucus is upset too
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.280]  because black unemployment is over 17% by the admitted government numbers I'm
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.960]  sure much much higher by the real numbers we've covered those plenty of
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.640]  times on the show but the pressure is coming down in fact I found the poll I
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.680]  mentioned earlier in the show I want to discuss this with you it is from back in
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.240]  August 18th but that's not that long ago because this chart covers several
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.280]  decades since 1979 and we do have the document cam on that as you can see
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.440]  there's been low points back in the past but ever since the late 90s Clinton
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.280]  left office essentially with high 60s and 70s numbers and things went down
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:18.520]  with George W. Bush down to about 43 of Americans satisfied with the national
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.960]  conditions then 9-11 happened support jumped back to 70 kind of went down from
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:32.120]  the mid 60s down to that 36 area and by the 2008 financial crash down to 7%
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.840]  approval of national conditions and what happened when Obama was elected
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.880]  things boosted only to a paltry 36 percent the writing was already on the
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.680]  wall and as you can see in the far edge of this graph things went right back
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:52.080]  down to 11% approval of national conditions now this is a Gallup poll
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.040]  this is gallup.com people from August 18th and you can just see how this is
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:02.120]  tied with the total downgrading of the financial conditions and the police
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:06.680]  state that's been set up since 9-11 things have gone straight down in a
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.720]  straight line down to 7 only with a brief bounce back with Obama and so the
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.520]  writing is on the wall people know he's lost his image the hype as some kind of
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.600]  savior as some kind of a guy who could do anything he has really no
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.840]  qualifications for the presidency and even worse all his advisors are
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:30.800]  traders to this country and what it stands for and it's going to clamp down
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:35.760]  on the middle class the working class the military beneficiaries they're
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.960]  having their pensions cut retiree benefits for the military could face
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:45.120]  cuts New York Times this is just from yesterday Washington looks to squeeze
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.440]  savings from one sacrosancted tidal winds like Social Security and medical
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.760]  care Medicare another big social welfare system growing rapidly but with far
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.120]  less scrutiny the health and pension systems of military retirees now
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.920]  there's more in that article but as we discussed with Lou Rockwell support for
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:08.360]  the Empire is going to crumble due to economic conditions the UK England
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.160]  Britain had to give up the Empire that's essentially why the US became the major
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.280]  engine and payment drive for that and it's going to happen to us too if for no
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.080]  other reason than economic conditions they're going to stop paying the bills
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.640]  for the military and the rest of it and we're going to have to bring some troops
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:30.320]  home at least I hope so plenty other in the news BA that's British Airways
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:38.440]  faces a 50 million euro bill for carbon emissions oh that's a bad sign Wow
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.920]  British Airways faces a bill of nearly nearly 50 million euro the highest of
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.880]  any airline we carriers around the world brought to the European Union's carbon
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:52.600]  emissions trading scheme next year meanwhile we have Howard Dean saying he
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:57.960]  saw an executive order that requires the US to comply with Kyoto oh just
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:02.200]  absolutely traitors and even admitting Barack Obama's a pure internationalist
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:07.840]  anyway I want to go now to Alex's special report on the NFL boycott and I
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.720]  hope you'll listen closely and tell your sports watching friends that bread and
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.680]  circuses time is over we need to get serious about what's going on in this

[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.760]  there treating you as if you're guilty upfront and groping you think about it
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:26.440]  imagine growing up if you would have heard that in the Soviet Union which by
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.720]  the way they didn't do this but imagine if they would have told you in the
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.680]  Soviet Union they grope you and grab your wife's breast and grab your
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:39.000]  genitals to go to a football game how did I know all this was coming in my
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.600]  film martial law 911 rise the police state I have state and national guard
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:49.720]  photos from their own websites where it showed them in 2003 4 and 5 having
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.400]  military out groping small children at college football games in places like
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:59.520]  Alabama and searching little three-year-olds little play purses this is
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.200]  about indoctrinating our children and turning our country into an absolute
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.720]  nightmare system and they know you need to fly for business or to see grandma
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.320]  who's dying of cancer they know you want to go see the overpriced football game
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.880]  and so they're saying okay we're gonna beta test and train everybody that this
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.720]  is okay and acceptable in these areas and then roll it out on the street so

[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:24.840]  Alex we still have lots more to come on the show coming up in the next segment
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:31.040]  Rizwan Sabir who was arrested and processed as a terrorist simply for being a
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:35.080]  journalist a PhD student trying to talk on the topic and then Alan Watt
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.880]  coming up researcher and I think we may get more into this revolution flash
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:44.960]  mobs and brain chips a grim vision of the future so why is this police state
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:50.220]  stuff happening now the NFL pat downs it has more to do with profiteering more
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:53.880]  than just profiteering that is it's more than just Michael Chertoff making
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.000]  money off body scanners when he was homeland security chief it's more than
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  you know just building some kind of security complex around the NFL and
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.320]  the other shopping malls where they're going to introduce this this is a clamp
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:11.200]  down because the system has known the economic crash was coming and it knows
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.040]  if it doesn't control the people they will become as this report predicts a
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:22.240]  Marxist-like proletariat basically rebelling against the system over purely
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.320]  economic issues that's what's coming that's what Gerald Salente and people on
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.320]  this show predicted for years and years and years even though you just saw
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:36.120]  Michael Bloomberg trying to take credit for the prediction just over the weekend
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:41.160]  you know trying to stump and say if you don't pass Obama's you know phony jobs
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.960]  bill that isn't going to create jobs then it's going to lead to riots and
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.280]  rebellions well that's already coming because of the economic conditions they've
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:53.160]  set in place so that's why we want to continue now with Alex's clip on boycotting
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:58.040]  the NFL and not putting up with the security system this is a Psyop plain
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.080]  and simple it is so scary now this is all being done so they can rob you blind
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:06.960]  the country's bankrupt Europe's imploding they're announcing world
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.280]  government openly they need to get this in place and so that's why I'm here to
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.560]  tell you even if you don't go watch the overpriced football games like 16 and a
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.160]  million plus million Americans what they say 16.5 million Americans go these
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.080]  stupid things they're now meaning that they'll be four five hours to get in
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:27.360]  with the groping don't be part of this ritual of corruption boycott it and
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:33.880]  even if you don't go to NFL games talk about boycotting it write letters to the
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.080]  head of the NFL write letters to their sponsors most importantly and tell them
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:42.320]  I'm not buying jerseys I'm not watching football I'm not doing any of this I'm
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.920]  gonna go to a city council meeting and talk about liberty and freedom or I'm
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:49.440]  gonna write my congresspeople or I'm gonna call to talk radio I'm gonna get
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.680]  on the field of issues to save our republic and our society this is why
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.720]  sports has become so sick because they mix it full of all the propaganda all
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:03.160]  the police state garbage to sell you this tyranny and now they're gonna use it
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:08.040]  to fully condition you and your children to accept tyranny so we must boycott the
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:12.840]  national football league because they are expanding this takeover into every
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.680]  facet of our lives including highways where we don't have a choice they're
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.560]  turning the entire country into a giant prison camp a giant reeducation center
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:26.960]  so please join me start your own website send your own emails but create a huge
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:33.280]  buzz we are boycotting the NFL until they tell big sis and homeland security to
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:40.180]  stop using them as a conditioning in cap to roll out and launch a total TSA
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:45.440]  occupation of America as the domestic police force and the internal passport
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:52.480]  boycott the NFL until they reverse this or America will be destroyed this is a
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:58.880]  serious hardcore red dawn takeover of jackboots and the NFL is deeply in bed
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:04.400]  with it I will be boycotting the NFL and I will be speaking out against it please
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.480]  spread the word do your own YouTube videos on this and let's continue to
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.160]  hammer this we're gonna be doing a lot more in the next few days and weeks they
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:15.800]  picked the NFL because they know they can always sell the tickets and they
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.000]  think you're dumb and you'll put up with anything to go be part of this
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.200]  garbage and watch a bunch of crackheads basically you know run around on the
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:28.280]  field show them that your will hasn't been broken show them that you're not an
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:34.640]  idiot show them that you're not a moron and you can see the rest of that clip
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:39.800]  at info wars calm it's on the YouTube channel the Alex Jones channel and Alex
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:43.240]  will be back tomorrow to rant even more about this but it's so important they
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:48.600]  obviously chose the NFL because it's a huge cultural institution people tune in
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.800]  and droves especially at the Super Bowl and they started the security last year
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.240]  here in Dallas well this is Austin but here in Texas at the Dallas stadium
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.000]  during the Super Bowl and they knew nobody really was gonna refuse it and
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.800]  that's why they've chosen to fully implement it and once people accept
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:10.720]  this it's gonna be hard culturally to say no we've always been doing you know
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.560]  terrorism pat down somebody could get hurt and after that it's just gonna
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:20.920]  become absolutely institutionalized we've already said no essentially to the
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:25.920]  TSA and now we're approaching the final stand that's all I'm gonna say about that
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:31.360]  for now we have a guest coming up after the break stay tuned info wars calm I'm

[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:33.080]  tomorrow we just saw his special report on the NFL boycott of the pat downs as
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:38.120]  the police state continues to expand when you know at just time with this total
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.720]  information revolution the internet has overtaken mainstream televised and
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:47.960]  print media and everywhere information is increasingly the threat we have Alan
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:51.880]  wad of cutting through the matrix coming up but right now we go to Rizwan saw
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:57.480]  beer he's a human rights activist and doctoral researcher at the University of
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.080]  Strathclyde where he's been researching Islam in British and Scottish
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:06.880]  government policy with the focus on counterterrorism in May 2008 he was
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.440]  detained for six days as a suspected member of Al Qaeda for being in
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.520]  possession of primary research literature he was released without charge
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.280]  he sued and won a sum of money but essentially he was targeted for
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.400]  downloading information so now information is the thing they have to
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:28.200]  contain not the actual threat of real terrorism of which he demonstrated none
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:32.480]  anyway we're going to get his take on it and find out more about this story are
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:38.200]  you there mr. Sabir hello call me Rizwan I am here right thanks for joining us so
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.960]  why don't you give us the background on how this whole situation arose what you
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:46.920]  were researching and we'll get more into the implications in a moment I I was
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:51.080]  researching at the time Al Qaeda and Hamas I was looking at the military
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:56.400]  tactics of both organizations and how they impacted upon or how ideology
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:00.560]  affected military tactics and whilst I was in the process of conducting a
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:05.440]  master's dissertation and preparing for an up-and-coming PhD I downloaded a
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.720]  document off the United States Department of Justice website nickname the
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.080]  Al Qaeda training manual the name was ironically given by the US Supreme
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:21.800]  Court to convict the 1998 East African bombers it was essentially the name was
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:27.560]  given to convince the jury that this document was very dangerous and the
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:32.360]  people that were on trial were terrorists and it did that to some to you
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:36.520]  know a great success and a conviction was secured this document was then
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.840]  declassified and placed on the US Department of Justice website which is
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.200]  where I accessed it from the ironic thing is that the same document but in a
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:48.720]  fuller version I without the redactions I downloaded a hundred and forty page
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:53.360]  document can be obtained via the University of Nottingham's own library
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.720]  which is where I was studying at the time or it can be purchased in high
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:03.600]  street bookshops such as Blackwell's Waterstones Amazon and W. H. Smith which
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:08.800]  are high street bookshops in Britain and so tell us how you came to be arrested
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:13.000]  for downloading a declassified document and what do you and your lawyer have to
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.560]  say about being but under suspicion for just something that's readily available
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:22.560]  the document was then sent to a friend of mine who was helping me with my
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:26.800]  research he was a member of staff at the University University staff found the
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:32.840]  document on his web on his computer when he was off sick one day they saw the
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:37.480]  al-Qaeda training manual along with two academic journal articles one by
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:41.880]  Quinton Wiktorowitz I believe of the University of Tennessee and the other
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:45.920]  one called Bush's revolution from foreign policy along with the al-Qaeda
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.160]  training manual all three documents were referred to the University
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:54.560]  management the registrar then actively unilaterally actively made a decision
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:59.680]  to call the police he contacted the police that the police then arranged for
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.120]  the regional counterterrorism unit to come on to campus to arrest my friend
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:08.920]  that morning when I arrived the police hadn't ascertained where the document
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:14.680]  had come from I went to ask if my friend was okay and they also arrested me it
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.520]  was only once I was in custody for about 10 to 12 hours that the mention of the
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.400]  al-Qaeda training manual came up I then informed them that this document was
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:28.280]  downloaded by me in the process of preparing for some upcoming research on
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.040]  al-Qaeda for a doctorate and they then realized that oh dear we have a major
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:37.240]  problem they then kept me in custody for seven days in solitary confinement
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:41.480]  where I was interrogated on a daily basis my house was searched my parents
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:46.120]  were evicted from the house various property and various academic material
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:51.520]  notably was seized as evidence just to you know provide the police with some
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:56.320]  kind of context or a charge that would stick to me that I was a terrorist any
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.400]  evidence was evidence that would be used against me that's the kind of
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:03.760]  position I was in that's where the manual came from and this is what happened
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:07.920]  obviously they couldn't prove anything and I was released after seven days of
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:12.120]  you know being in solitary confinement and the kind of placed back into society
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:19.160]  to carry on as nothing had happened no evidence of the climate where there is
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.520]  no evidence where they let the real al-Qaeda hijackers into the US into
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.360]  Britain no one's fired no one's how to countable and no one admits that for
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.680]  instance the underwear bomber the State Department helped him get on the plane
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:36.040]  but people who are researching now there's civil rights implications there's
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:40.680]  kind of racial targeting implications but I think even bigger than that is the
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:45.000]  kind of wiki leaks implications why are people being tortured and thrown into
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.120]  prison and extradited and and put on watch list for downloading documents
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:53.560]  what does it say about the internet revolution that's come and how they
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.760]  want to control information or what have you found in your research I think I
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:00.600]  think that's a really really interesting point you raise and you know I'm
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.640]  looking at domestic UK counterterrorism so I'm looking at the British war on
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:10.280]  terror and one thing that is absolutely evident in the plethora of anti-terrorism
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:15.640]  legislation that has been introduced since 9 11 and especially since the
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:20.760]  London bombings on the 7th of July is that the focus of this legislation and
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.520]  anti-terrorism law is on preemptive action against those that hold
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:31.440]  information so for example the police and the security services are not
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.240]  focusing particularly on those that are involved in active terrorist plots
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:38.800]  because there's not that many people that are actively involved in plotting
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.960]  terrorism in in the United Kingdom what they are involved in is catching 18
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:48.440]  year-old young people who out of curiosity most of the time or because
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:51.480]  they're feeling a bit naughty have a look at something like the Al Qaeda
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:55.760]  training manual which is a legitimate open source declassified document they
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:59.000]  will be in possession of something like this they will be found in possession
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.160]  of something like this they will then be put through the criminal justice system
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.480]  and with the way that the legislation in Britain is worded they will then be
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.320]  convicted as terrorists if you have a look at the statistics in Britain I
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:15.600]  believe 39% of all terrorist convictions that have taken place since 9
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:22.040]  11 up until March 2008 39% I believe have been because of possession of
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:27.720]  documentation i.e. information that can maybe assist somebody who's involved in
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:32.080]  terrorism that's what the charges now whether it's actively useful for
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:35.760]  somebody preparing for an act of terrorism is a total totally different
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:39.720]  matter for example let's take the Al Qaeda training manual now this document I
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:44.160]  believe from my understanding and my research it was produced by a double
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:50.600]  agent who was working for the American Special Forces in the 1970s it refers to
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:55.560]  modern technology as facsimiles and fax machines it is hardly the stuff of
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:00.960]  modern terrorism and modern terrorists it has no practical value whatsoever yet
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.920]  this is the kind of information that is being used to lock away people to prison
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:10.760]  as terrorists and you're right it is information and the legislation and the
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:14.480]  kind of programs that we have in Britain and I think this is extendable to
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:18.680]  Western Europe or or you know the northern nations on the whole is that
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:24.800]  most of our policies and programs are to criminalize information and people who
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:28.520]  are asking questions by looking at information and I think that's a really
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:33.680]  really tell-tale sign that there's no real substantial threat what we are
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:37.480]  threatened by is people knowing and understanding things that we would in
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.320]  the West rather than not understand well yeah you mentioned the double agent
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.000]  who was involved of course that's throughout the whole history of supposed
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.160]  Al Qaeda it's always been an extremist arm for a foreign policy goal and it's
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:55.040]  very useful for them to clamp down and the police state domestically as well
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:00.320]  but really the domestic police state has more to do with economic issues but
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.760]  where do you see on using Al Qaeda what is your research shown on how they use
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:12.160]  it for foreign policy aims well I mean Al Qaeda is an enigma it's a mystery
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:16.680]  nobody really knows what it is I remember the police asking me whilst I
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:21.520]  was in custody what Al Qaeda was and when I told them I subscribed to what
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:26.360]  Noam Chomsky and the author of the book Inside Al Qaeda Jason Burke has written
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:30.640]  and said Al Qaeda is used to be an organization a very small group with a
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:36.120]  core membership at no more than 15 to 20 people possibly but is now turned into
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:40.160]  an ideology I remember the police officers looking at me like I just told
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:46.280]  them that the Sun is made of cheese this is the kind of reaction I got and for me
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.960]  most police officers who are on the ground who are actively working within
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:53.480]  these counterterrorism units have frankly no idea of what they're
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:59.680]  confronting the state uses the excuse of Al Qaeda to justify its own security
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:04.160]  theater it's that perfect bogeyman that just just like communism and the Red
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.960]  Scare was in the you know the 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s and 90s it's that perfect
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:13.440]  scapegoat no one really knows what it is you know and that therefore allows the
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:18.240]  state to say and do as it wishes because we are we are in this constant
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:23.560]  state of war against this enemy it's I mean I don't believe that the existence
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:29.440]  of Al Qaeda is all that worrying it's a very small number of people if they
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.920]  even exist anymore notably due to the American campaigns in Afghanistan Iraq
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.840]  and now AFPAC as the counterinsurgency theorists call it so it's almost a
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:45.440]  minute threat what it is is a regional force or regional forces that take on a
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.320]  so-called I Al Qaeda ism the kind of ideological persuasion to give
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:55.480]  themselves more international credibility and weight yeah now
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:00.760]  conveniently the whole Middle East is in revolution in turmoil and the West has
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:05.280]  even partnered with Al Qaeda there in Libya but what kind of chilling effect
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:10.200]  have you seen in the UK as a whole due to terrorism and what what have you seen
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:15.480]  in particular regarding your case I'm not sure I understand the question do
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:20.360]  you want to ask that again yeah have you seen a chilling effect in general from
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.920]  the Al Qaeda thing and in communities in Britain what's the atmosphere been like
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:30.480]  the fear element and then more on your particular case and the process of being
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:36.200]  awarded this money in terms of the kind of there's a community reaction to
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:42.120]  Al Qaeda and I believe that most people don't believe that it exists because no
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.920]  evidence is really provided because it's a mystery that the state refuses to
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:52.040]  engage with its communities I'm not just referring to the Muslims of the UK but
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:55.720]  I'm referring to Muslims all communities across the board in Britain
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:00.400]  regarding this threat we don't know you know the nature of the threat we don't
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.920]  know the series of the threat all we're told is that there was a bombing on the
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:09.920]  7th of July in London there were maybe six what you could deem to be serious
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:15.120]  and real terrorist plots that were carried out by what they are now
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:22.320]  referring as you know lone as self self-proclaimed Al Qaeda sleeper cells
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.800]  and people born and raised in Britain that take up arms and try and fight the
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.160]  state so no one really knows what this is so there is a real reluctance to
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:36.320]  accept what the state is telling us and for good reason to after all this is
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.600]  the state that told us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and we went
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.920]  into a war there were no weapons of mass destruction and that has really
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:47.920]  affected especially the Muslim community because all we see as the state
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.560]  is a state that is lying to us to justify its own policies and programs so I
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:57.200]  think until you have an honest debate regarding Al Qaeda and the threat that is
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:01.360]  posed to Britain I think you will have severe severe problems in winning and
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.640]  gaining the trust also when you look at the fact the fact of the matter remains
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:10.320]  in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the attacks that
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:14.600]  are taking place that are targeted at British interests and the UK are coming
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:18.000]  from the north of Ireland now I've looked at the figures for example for
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:26.480]  2006 and 2008 we have in the region of 349 terrorist attacks yet 347 have
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:31.560]  come from dissident Irish Republican groups however the press the government
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:35.360]  the state the security apparatus they don't talk about the north of Ireland
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:39.160]  and the threat that stems from that part of the country instead it always tries
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:43.880]  to focus on Muslim terrorism or Islamic terrorism when there's been two
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:48.800]  incompetent terror attacks or two failed attacks that have taken place in that
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:53.760]  same time yet the response of the state is extremely disproportionate when it
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.680]  comes down to dealing with Muslims in terms of your question I you know I've
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:02.920]  taken a full stop in there but in terms of your question regarding what what I
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:05.920]  think of the compensation and the damages well yeah what point were you
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:10.960]  trying to prove it and then how did the compensation come about the point I
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:15.920]  was trying to prove in terms of my legal case and fighting what I believe
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:22.400]  was a racist action but taken by the police and the state when they were
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:27.600]  processing me through the system was I was trying to fight fight for one to
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:32.160]  clear my name and two for some accountability and I believe that the
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:37.160]  £20,000 that have been awarded to me in damages along with the acceptance that
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:41.800]  my legal fees will be paid along with the fact that the police have now
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:45.800]  admitted that I'm not a terrorist along with the fact that the intelligence
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:51.440]  that they hold on me all the inaccurate entries have been agreed to be removed
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:55.880]  by the police which I believe is a real real successful resolution to a legal
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:01.480]  battle an exhausting legal battle that has taken three years is this issue over
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:05.800]  though absolutely not because one thing that is overlooked is how public
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:12.080]  institutions such as universities in the UK have become deeply securitized so
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:17.400]  what my case shows is how the university disregarded all policies and programs
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:22.600]  and processors that it was meant to follow if similar circumstances to what
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:26.560]  I experienced and what happened at the University of Nottingham arose they
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:30.880]  totally ignored them and in the climate in the hysteria surrounding Muslims
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:35.080]  picked up the phone and decided to call the police now they also need to be
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:39.840]  held to account no apology has been issued yet they have actively sought I
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:44.080]  believe I have evidence to prove this an academic who wrote about this and who's
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:49.280]  suspended at the moment has has written about this that the university
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:54.520]  actively sought to sabotage me to discriminate against me and those who
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:59.360]  dare to support me in my struggle to clear my name until the University of
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:05.280]  Nottingham has also been held to account this issue just cannot close in my eyes
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:11.560]  it can't be buried as much as the University or the state tries to so
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:14.800]  we're gonna be back in a moment after the break but more broadly the brandy
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:19.160]  the Bradley Manning issue with WikiLeaks again he's been held and
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:23.000]  essentially tortured for leaking this information now that was leaked
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.760]  information that wasn't yet declassified but there's definitely a parallel
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.880]  between his case and yours where the whole system is coming down on him for
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:35.800]  just trying to essentially understand what's been going on for the past decade
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:40.080]  in foreign policy and the domestic agenda what do you think about that case
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:44.360]  and what should be done with him and why is there more attention I mean Bradley
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:49.600]  Manning's case is absolutely tragic and it shows that regardless of the fact
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:54.120]  that our democratic nations are committed to this so-called idea of
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.680]  freedom and transparency what Bradley Manning's case sadly shows is that when
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:05.000]  somebody does try to live according to those principles a man of great great
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  courage in integrity and bravery when he does try to live his life and and act
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.680]  according to those principles that exist he is then punished and Bradley Manning's
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:22.800]  case is a category example that when the state decides to neglect its duty and
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:27.680]  care towards its citizens this is what you get and Bradley Manning has
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:32.360]  systematically been abused by the entire system he's now been tortured he's
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:37.080]  he's not got a right to appear trial it's an absolute absolute tragedy what
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.240]  Bradley Manning is going through in terms of whether I have suffered the same
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:46.160]  as Bradley Manning absolutely not Bradley Manning's case is we've got a
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.400]  brief taste of it we do have the break coming up hold that thought we'll get

[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:26.560]  second hour third hour coming up without a lot in just a few moments but a little
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:32.040]  more with Rizwan Sabir who was arrested for essentially downloading a terrorist
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:36.120]  manual and the point I was trying to make is that you were held for six days
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.480]  without charge Bradley Manning's been held now essentially indefinitely
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:44.920]  without charge all for downloading and linking information in his case just
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:50.360]  downloading information in your case and so why are the regular proceedings of
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.920]  law and justice not good enough to handle these issues if indeed there even
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:59.920]  was any wrongdoing which hasn't been demonstrated in your case sure what
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:05.360]  what what seems to be applicable in times of insecurity or when the government
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:12.200]  states is the government claims there is a moment of insecurity usual laws and
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:17.320]  procedures are suspended now this usually has to come at a great cost to
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:22.160]  personal liberty so people like myself and more so like Bradley Manning brave
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:25.720]  and courageous people like Bradley Manning have to suffer the consequences
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:31.040]  but the tragedy of the situation is that rather than be up in arms criticising
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:35.560]  the state and the establishment for the actions they take most of the population
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:39.920]  is fooled by the propaganda that the government usually put out to say that
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:45.400]  in times of insecurity we need to justify these extreme measures and they
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.960]  are for your security what they fail or what they probably realise but don't
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:54.280]  care is that they know as well as anybody else that they will never be
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:56:00.520]  subjected to these extremely draconian and unlawful programs and policies so
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:04.320]  therefore they are willing to allow people to be held like Bradley Manning
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.200]  to be held indefinitely without the right to a fair trial without the normal
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:13.520]  burden and onus of evidence being on the state to prove his guilt because they
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.200]  know that they will never be affected by it and this is the state at its most
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:24.680]  extreme justifying and using all relevant measures to sell that narrative
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:29.000]  and the public sadly agreeing and accepting that because they believe in
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.960]  this illusion that they are being protected by the state when it just
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:37.040]  couldn't be farther from the truth in Britain we have a series of programs
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:41.240]  that initially started off strictly as counterterrorism programs but have
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:46.840]  slowly creeped into everyday life and that's how secure a nation becomes
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.800]  more securitized and that's how the government therefore controls the
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:58.160]  population in a lot with a lot more ease and and efficiency but there is no
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:02.120]  security as you say it's only an illusion securitized perhaps but
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:06.080]  security can never be lasting they can't protect you everywhere even if you
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:10.800]  bought into the fairy tale instead we've had to give up our western civil
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.960]  liberties and acts absolute disgrace that's the only thing worth holding on
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:19.720]  to you can't protect from you know a random person doing something but tell
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:23.120]  us how you plan to move forward are you still researching this issue and what
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:26.960]  do you think are the most important things to break that illusion and let
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:31.760]  people know what's really been going on with terrorism sure what I am doing is
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:37.120]  I am still researching UK counterterrorism I'm going into my final year of
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:41.520]  my doctorate I intend to complete that by October next year but at the same time
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:45.800]  now I plan to take all necessary actions through any means necessary against
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:50.840]  the University of Nottingham for the way but a vindictive way and an illegal way
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:55.240]  in numerous respects that they have treated not only myself but those brave
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:59.440]  and courageous people that did to speak up for for me and did to stand with me
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:04.240]  and I forgot the second aspect of your question if you would mind repeating it
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:08.920]  please well how are you looking forward and how should we break this illusion
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:17.040]  of al-Qaeda terrorism sure the illusion of terrorism needs to be broken when the
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:23.680]  community which is the at the epicenter of this problem i.e. the Muslim community
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:28.720]  especially in Britain stops accepting what's being told by the government and
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:33.000]  comes out and says you can't do this I don't mean to cut you off we're out of

[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:19.800]  work on the technical issues but maybe you could tell us right now what are the
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:24.600]  most important things you see going on currently alan well it's planned chaos
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:31.200]  you've got a world is supposed to merge into one unifying force and under a
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:35.040]  government we keep forgetting that because we hope you get stuck on the
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:39.400]  chaos they introduced on the way and we we talk about the chaos here they are
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:44.400]  everywhere across the world as increases here is there so i always try to keep my
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.320]  sights on their goal which of course is a unified europe which they have the
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:53.760]  crisis in europe are simply meant to bond them even further into giving up all
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:58.760]  sovereignty and bring themselves under one banking system one bank for the whole
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:03.320]  europe north america is going through the same chaos because we've read the
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:08.520]  second continent actually the whole of america's to be integrated just had a
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:13.520]  meeting by the way and i've kept that awfully quiet and basically they
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.840]  discussed the borders as all they're telling us and they've given all access
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:25.400]  or access to all canadian's data to the special security services within the
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:30.040]  united states we're being integrated every every month basically into the
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:34.400]  next step of the amalgamation they're trying to do the same with with the far
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:38.720]  east australia new zealand china japan all these countries come under the third
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:43.280]  block and so this is really what's all about so carl quickly talked about this
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:48.280]  he said eventually it all comes under the bank of international settlements with
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:52.560]  the IMF running the countries or the blocks or regions and of course i
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:56.440]  unified government for the world that's supposed to come out of it all
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:01.800]  eventually and the moment they have to get a single government like europe set
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.880]  up in for the americas and this is also part of the chaos we're going through
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:11.320]  now or we can't survive on our own the money situation we need a unified bank
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:16.000]  and that came out in the 80s during the free trade negotiations that we actually
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.720]  talked about putting a central bank for the whole of america's in at montreal
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:27.320]  well can you tell us what's going on right now in europe with the bailouts and

[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:39.120]  Dyke sitting in and on the line with this is Alan Watt of cutting through the
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:43.840]  matrix.com Alan the question I was trying to put to you before the break is
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.560]  what's happening now with Germany and France trying to create a new bank over
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:54.640]  Europe all to do the this ill-advised Greek bailout and what will the Western
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:09:00.640]  country's role be in paying for that well we already have a treaty I don't
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:06.760]  people realize that Canada and the US made a treaty with the EU and to help
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:11.440]  with the bailouts should they come we're actually doing it already anyway that
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:15.760]  was separate from the NAFTA deal and the European deal and so we're all in it
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:21.280]  together that's a whole idea of this chaos this planned and well managed chaos
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:25.560]  is to get everyone to their knees until the public say well nothing's working
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:30.200]  please make it better and they come forward with their with their new idea
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:35.400]  which is an old idea very old they'll dust off the old the parchment they've
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:39.320]  all signed and got ready and they'll present to the public that the plan
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.720]  that was set up even when they created the IMF international monetary fund
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:49.160]  member Bretton Woods was part one and the founder of it said they'll be a part
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:54.680]  two after he's dead that which is about now and we're going through part two now
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:10:00.040]  the idea is that a central bank must be set up for each one of these amalgamates
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:06.400]  but basically continents that North America Europe and one for the Far
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:11.200]  East as well but have subsidiary banks of course for the they won't call them
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:15.640]  national governments anymore but the partners within the region and and this
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:19.600]  is simply part two Bretton Woods were going into with the central bank and
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:23.760]  again quickly talked about that from the Council on Foreign Relations from their
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:28.560]  own history records that was the whole intention for a hundred years was to set
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:33.880]  up a supreme bank for the planet and a central bank for each one of the
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:39.080]  amalgamated to continents basically right well amalgamation would be the key
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:44.000]  word consolidation we know the IMF with the third world it's been so much more
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  about conditionalities than anything to do with the dead that's just sort of the
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.320]  inciting incident to get the country on the line and then the hook is total
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:57.720]  takeover now that's happening in Europe no yeah well the whole idea of the IMF
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:02.840]  is not to help third world countries never was it was simply to start off with
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:07.120]  foreign aid that was the con with foreign aid and you give them foreign aid
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:11.040]  you give them loans you get them into trouble they can't pay them back and you
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:15.520]  go in and you grab all of the resources that was the plan of the banks and we
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:21.280]  must remember that even Rockefeller said the same thing that we can't depend on
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:26.320]  national governments anymore he said it's far better than intelligent force
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:32.240]  intelligentsia and bankers who are used to dealing with economies run the world
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:38.160]  rather than leave it to the national interest groups to steer the way they
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:42.160]  want to go and into chaos and wars that was his excuse for it but of course it
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:46.600]  was even older than him this plan and we're going through it now and they've
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:50.880]  already announced in the IMF in Europe that they want the right in fact they've
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:54.960]  taken the right of some countries to start to do all of their financing for
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:58.840]  them but that's reading their books doing their books not leaving to their own
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:04.440]  governments to do so the IMF wants the power to be the big chief basically he
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:09.640]  will do every member's books and that's all of your economy and what goes to
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:13.600]  welfare what goes to Social Security health care all of those things it
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:17.600]  wants the sole right to do all that and do away with your that part of your
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:23.560]  government back home and when are we going to openly see the IMF on the
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:28.040]  United States preying on our own country here and on Canada and the rest of the
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.440]  West I don't think a bit too long now because they're not fools at the top we
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:36.320]  think it's all about greed but it's not it's not a big part of it because they
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:41.960]  are allowed to reward themselves very well at the top and they planned of
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:46.000]  course the bank crash you can't take the reins of observation off of banks and
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.400]  let them go to it without them just simply ripping the whole continent off
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:56.680]  which they did with their their mortgage crisis etc but they plan to bring it
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:00.840]  down you've got it big changes happening you've got to create chaos and
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:06.360]  financial chaos is the easiest and the most powerful way to do it and then
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:09.120]  that's when the public knows they say everything's broken it's not working
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:13.760]  please help us so we turn rounds to the government the ones who are abusing us
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:17.840]  and ask them to make it better and they come out with their plans that's
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:21.040]  exactly what they're doing right now and there's a most of it
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.760]  unfortunately in America has kept fairly quiet from the mainstream media
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:28.880]  because the media barns that's her job is to control all information to the
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.840]  public nothing about informing us about truth or anything it's about media
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:38.600]  retest but really factual retention to themselves but they've had that big
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:45.320]  meeting as I say and another two or three to go and by 2012 they want the
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:51.160]  Americas to be amalgamated we've watched since 2005 openly a meeting together
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:58.720]  two presidents and a prime minister from Mexico US and Canada signing
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:04.360]  agreements they said that five to do as 2010 five major ones and because there
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:08.560]  was such a backlash amongst those in the know especially in Canada and protests
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:13.360]  they kept it quiet from then on except a little bits in the paper but they've
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:17.480]  just had another meeting they go down separately now into Latin America and
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:22.480]  sign sign these charters separately instead of going down the three amigos
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:26.320]  that they used to do and the sign the charters and they're talking about
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:32.200]  amalgamations amalgamations and sharing our economies that's also sharing your
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:37.640]  your taxation tax base basically all imports exports we're already doing that
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:41.880]  under the last big deal is signed with US and Canada we're sharing a lot of
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:46.840]  tariffs for imports and exports people in the federal government in Canada
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:51.800]  bureaucrats can actually apply for jobs in similar positions in the US federal
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:56.480]  government vice versa it's with that for a few years we are integrating and all
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:01.560]  of this chaos is meant to bring it on even more smoothly setting it up for a
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.560]  smooth transfer and there's no real shock once we were totally amalgamated
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:11.680]  it's all working already and that's the idea of of crisis after crisis to the
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:16.480]  population members all perception management it must sound like a
[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:21.640]  logical if unfortunate thing to do is to give up all sovereignty and amalgamate
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:26.800]  into one giant continental system well controlling chaos I could see is your
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:30.240]  key word today and it's very appropriate just on Friday we had Mayor
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:34.600]  Bloomberg predicting that there's going to be riots and economic rebellion if
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:39.400]  they don't pass the new phony jobs bill yeah just more perception as you say
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:42.880]  of course as you know I know you covered heavily at the time they've been
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:48.400]  planning for economic riots for years since at least 2007 openly in the
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:53.080]  public documents the army war college is written for people to get ready to
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:58.560]  control these economic riots and now it's here it do you see the NFL pat down
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:04.120]  measures bringing TSA style security to the bus and train and shopping centers
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:08.120]  as part of that same preparing for the economic collapse or is that another
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:13.320]  part of the police state it's part of that for sure but it's also part of that
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:18.200]  this terrorism nonsense is here with us forever now this is permanent state and
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:23.400]  they're simply training the public at to adapt and they will adapt very quickly
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:30.000]  to the new system of total security total observation no no bodily rights
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.760]  even to go and molest it anywhere even into a venture into a supermarket you
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:39.040]  probably have a special card with the active chip and if you don't have it
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:43.360]  with you alarms go off make the security grabs you take sure that's all
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:49.760]  it's likely to come down we forget it's long before 2001 they were talking they
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:55.080]  were planning the amalgamation of of America with the Canada Mexico the but
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:58.760]  Chile and a few other countries Brazil into a few countries actually that
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:06.400]  brought into the NAFTA agreement quietly and the in Canada with 1998 they
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:12.720]  passed an omnibus anti-terror bill nothing was happening in 1998 in Canada
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:20.120]  and Alan Rock federal governments ran the through himself basically and then
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:25.160]  even off to work at the United Nations and even the journalists in Canada were
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:30.200]  saying well what's this is a total martial law situation what's happening
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:34.120]  nothing no reason was given to the public and they went back to sleep as
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:37.760]  always because they didn't see it being put into effect immediately you got if
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:42.520]  I remember to inside the US that they knew there was coming chaos even back
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:47.800]  in the 80s and 90s they've been creating special forces within the US with the
[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:53.240]  police working with troops abroad getting training back in the 90s that this
[02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:57.880]  is no that actually 2001 was just the kickoff of the next part of the plan
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:02.080]  they'd already planned it and were implementing it long before that right
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:07.320]  but specifically what do you have to say now only three years later really four
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:12.400]  years later on the revolution flash mobs and brain chips part of of revealing
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:15.960]  the plan to come of a revolutionary population particularly in the Middle
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:21.720]  East police state and the in the Western countries Alan well again that's why
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:26.680]  they were creating this big super internal army since the 80s and 90s the
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:31.400]  multi-jurisdictional task force is the column up here in Canada they've even
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:34.720]  shown us them practice the police practicing kicking doors in across
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:38.320]  the Middle East with the the troops so they can come back here and do the same
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:42.720]  thing one day so obviously since they were going to use economics and
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:48.240]  inflation unemployment poverty to bring in this system hyperinflation they
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:52.640]  didn't expect to riots they don't make a move without figuring out every
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:57.360]  possible reaction from every segment of society and they plan for that before
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:01.240]  they even make the move so that there's nothing happening that's not supposed to
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:05.200]  happen according to those at the top so they prepare to deal with mass riots
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:10.560]  which they want actually and the terrorism what will gradually be
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.600]  controlling riots and the people again will adapt into that's really what
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:19.640]  the this massive security system is for eventually over the years to adapt into
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:24.760]  that and forget all about the terrorists this is a very old technique and this is
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:29.360]  a very old bunch of rulers we're really living under with our kinds of how to

[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:36.520]  the info wars nightly news we have guests Russell Blalock and Alfred a desk
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:41.560]  and plenty of interesting topics short segment now but we've got a long segment
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:45.600]  coming up with Alan Watt one of the preeminent researchers on the world
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:49.560]  state they're bringing in to play and really how they're going to consolidate
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:55.640]  all these regions under you know one or just a few banks and under a global sort
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:00.960]  of system so Alan I'd like to bring up how fast is this coming down how fast
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:05.080]  is it going to be the kind of widespread depression that perception alone
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:09.520]  won't be able to mask and what will they do with the so-called revolutionary
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:14.480]  masses whether they've identified the right problem or not well they already
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:18.440]  have their plans to deal with the revolutionary masses they know who
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:22.280]  everyone is and of course the internet's fantastic for that because they
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:26.040]  with their pulse on the public all the time and that there's no privacy at all
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:30.440]  it's offered data collection and so they'll be dealt with quite easily they
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:34.080]  can come in and take them out very quickly in fact if that's the case that's
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:41.600]  necessary or the demon necessary and the already have internal armies set up I
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:44.400]  mean police are not police anymore they haven't been pleased for a long time
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:49.760]  they're really military guys most the recruits to the last two or fifteen
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:54.120]  maybe in 20 years or from the military and they've had all the experience in
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:58.160]  rounding up people and putting in the camps etc that we've done very very
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:03.360]  quickly we saw that done in fact during one olympic games I think it was in the
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:07.360]  States and they went out and within a couple of hours that everyone wound up
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:12.080]  that was on a list hundreds and hundreds of people so it's quite easy to do
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:17.480]  that the practice for an awful long time so they're not worried about that at
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:21.960]  all I think they want to understand that the battle is for the majority of the
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:26.200]  they call the silent majority in the general populations there's always the
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:30.680]  bulk of the population will always go with the regular media the status quo
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:34.520]  the answers are given are enough to satisfy them it makes them feel
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:40.400]  comfortable and cozy but they feel they're part of something the image that's
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:46.160]  presented as their nation their country all that kind of thing so rioters will
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:51.480]  be presented really as the new terrorists you see and and that actually
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:56.080]  brings the silent majority closer to government for protection and they're
[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:00.840]  all for whatever measures are necessary to subdue this what appears to be
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:06.480]  righteous mobs in society that's how it's going to be presented to the public
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:11.240]  and all the plans I'm sure have been tested and put through computer
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:16.080]  simulations and God knows what else for the scenarios are coming but 2012 is
[02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:22.320]  a big year they hope to have actually hope to have the the U.S. and Latin
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:27.640]  America mainly amalgamated understand if you watch the European Union you can
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:31.880]  become a member but you don't have to be totally integrated so step by step
[02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:36.480]  process and they hope to have at least them in the first part of integration
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:39.920]  with their peace and prosperity partnerships and all the rest of it in
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:45.920]  peace and security partnerships etc they hope to have all done by 2012 so
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:49.960]  this might just if they're on time don't manage to get the riot started
[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:54.200]  because of the inflation and the people living on the on the fixed lower incomes
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:59.000]  of the first to really really come out and protested because they get hit
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.320]  first and it's any cancer a compensate for it there's no extra income that
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:09.840]  happened of course partly in Britain too already we see that and they'll do the
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:13.640]  same in the States it's a massive welfare system there's a lot of people on
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:18.960]  fixed pensions across the country and they can't cope as the prices escalate
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:25.080]  this is all but done by design absolutely and now now we have the NFL
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:29.000]  starting to pat down its fans they started this at the Super Bowl but it's a
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:33.360]  new ritual in this fascist system that to even get the bread and circuses now
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:38.920]  first you submit to the security and then you get the games Alan yes and to
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:46.000]  be honest with you I personally have to bypass the mentality of the people who
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:53.560]  persist and and going through it if you any dignity dignity at all you wouldn't
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:57.440]  even have subjected to the first pat down at airport just stop traveling
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:02.800]  simple as that same thing with games etc if you have no personal dignity then
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:08.680]  then go ahead and be patted down and be part of the big herd this is a time
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:13.240]  when you have decided an individual where you stand on things and how far
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:19.040]  you're gonna allow this incredible totalitarian system to go because believe
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:23.120]  you me they won't stop there they won't stop with that down during x-rays you
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:27.800]  and get body cavities churches anything to humiliate you and teach you that
[02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:32.760]  you're nothing you're nothing I agree this is about taking our lives back
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:36.160]  sorry to cut you off we're coming up on the break Alan we're gonna have plenty
[02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:41.080]  more time just after this stay with us we're just starting to get into it I'm

[02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:19.560]  turned in this influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:24.200]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:05.640]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:10.120]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything
[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:14.520]  about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your children and even

[02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:21.800]  some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right
[02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:26.120]  you see he predicted the collapse of GM Panny Mae Freddie Mac and America's
[02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:30.000]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:34.440]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:38.120]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:42.200]  eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video

[02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:22.920]  I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in for Alex Jones again he'll be back tomorrow but
[02:33:22.920 --> 02:33:26.720]  right now we're in with Alan Watt who's done some of the deepest research I've
[02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:31.520]  seen on the bigger system they're bringing into place so Alan we know they've
[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:36.680]  set the stage for these economic riots obviously all that's upon us but the
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:43.480]  RAND Corporation also wrote three years ago in 2008 lobbying the Pentagon to
[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:48.760]  start a new war to save the US economy we know they've also set the stage for
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:53.280]  World War 3 the whole Middle East is essentially in revolution how are they
[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:57.080]  going to transform that to achieve their larger goal Alan and what do you see on
[02:33:57.080 --> 02:34:02.320]  the on the immediate front well it's so interesting too this strange RAND
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:06.000]  cooperation that's a non-profit organization supposedly that every
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:10.440]  country pays millions if not sometimes billions of dollars too for their
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:15.120]  forecast and there are think tanks supposedly as part of the institution
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:20.040]  they were on the go during the whole Cold War they ran the American Society
[02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:25.360]  during the Cold War as part of game theory you probably studied that and they
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:30.480]  used game theory that every citizen's personal profile into the super computer
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:35.440]  and RAND Corporation and they worked for the entire length of the Cold War with
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:41.000]  the Pentagon basically dictating the lifestyle the system and the future for
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:44.880]  the whole of the US so here they are at again if they were stopped of course
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:47.680]  because we're not really run by government to understand where the
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:53.520]  government's there to put things into law that's it and pass on information to
[02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:58.240]  all their helpers but the RAND Corporation all the big foundations and
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:02.600]  corporations are the parallel government that Maggie Thatcher called them in fact
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:07.040]  the parallel government so did Carl Quigley that's what they are we're not
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:11.760]  run by democracy or even republicanism we're run by private corporations and
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:17.560]  we always really have been so and that ties back in with Rockefeller with his
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:22.480]  comment on as far preferable to have it run by bankers and intelligentsia and
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:28.680]  leaving countries to their sovereign destinies basically so we're well on our
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:36.000]  way to this well getting back though to the TS the pat downs of the arenas you
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.640]  don't remember how many things it fulfills in one go now it's the only time
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:46.280]  that men today will try and bond with their their sons is taking them to a
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:50.720]  ballgame and because they're not made at home they're not made at all in fact
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:55.960]  today but they still have this tribal instinct and passing on knowledge to
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:59.320]  your son and this is what it's to get man so come to watch these guys bash each
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:03.880]  other on the field and then he goes home and he does whatever else tells him
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:07.200]  to do when he's at home but anyway the Sun's getting brought up now he'll get
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:10.520]  brought up getting talked that this is normal son you go through all this
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:15.360]  humiliation and then you get your reward of watching the game and so that it's
[02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:19.240]  going to help to train the next generation this is here forever this
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:24.400]  system for our lifetimes at least this is here for an awful awful long time it's
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:28.560]  called perpetual war constant conflict they called it in the military magazine
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:33.200]  and this is what they have got planned for generations as you bring this whole
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:37.800]  world into this new order of things and it's a completely new way of living it's
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:41.960]  a system where you can't decide anything pretty well on your own as an
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:48.440]  individual as a whole new set of rules and how to live by and you'll be taught
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:51.840]  eventually to serve the world's fate that's to be the highest honor they're
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:56.440]  already pushing all of that across Europe big time they call it
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:37:00.320]  communitarianism where the federal government is supposedly
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:04.640]  decentralizing its power down to the local level and they already have these
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:10.400]  commissars from the private NGO is run by the foundations to be the leaders and
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.480]  this is a new Soviet system understand because this is how the Soviet system
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:20.720]  was supposed to be ruled by councils so each little community each trade each
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:26.240]  factory each organization had is NGO speaker supposedly speaking on behalf
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:30.520]  of the public underneath them or that they represented and that's called the
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:36.800]  Soviet and this is to be a new Soviet system advanced Soviet system for the
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:40.320]  whole planet that we're going under but it just like the Soviet system was
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:45.400]  a big con because they say one thing and do the other bank private banks
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:50.160]  flourished incredibly within the Soviet Union for all their talk about a
[02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:54.600]  central bank run by the state the private banks would flourish as long as
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:38:00.400]  they did not make their money off of the profit or the profit off of labor now
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:03.920]  lawyers can run rings around that and and he did from the beginning in the
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:07.240]  Bolsheviks right through the Soviet system and the same thing with this
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:12.040]  system that's coming in and those who serve the system the higher up the
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:15.760]  level that they go the greater the lifestyle they will live so reward is
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:21.480]  a big big part of it but they do want a big mass at the bottom to live in
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:25.920]  poverty as you go through this knowing we're supposed to all die off according
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:31.400]  to the the military magazines the think tanks for the military of the US and for
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:36.000]  Britain they both came out with the same basic projections of the year 2040
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:39.960]  that they're another one of the year 2050 and they say there's gonna be a
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:45.720]  drastic decline in population across the whole world including the West from
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:52.920]  now basically up until 2050 so this is not meant to fool us forever we're
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:56.280]  supposed to die off most people are not having children to start with except
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:01.080]  immigrants and even immigrants of course adapt the lifestyle very quickly it's
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:05.840]  very enticing to be told as a child you can do anything you want and and they go
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:10.120]  and do it and often kill themselves in the process through disease or various
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:16.000]  other means but this is a long-term plan to reduce the populations and and even
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.600]  world government is not the end goal of it all the military think tanks said
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:26.520]  there'll be a world government for a short time and then the world will be
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:32.920]  consist of a few high-tech city-states a few high-tech city-states and countries
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:37.160]  will be gone long forgotten and even the regions that were under under the
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:41.480]  United Nations will be gone as well so we're this is all stepping stone to the
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:44.640]  next stepping stone to the next stepping stone until they have their
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:49.040]  wonderful utopia for themselves at the top high-tech city-states those who
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:54.480]  survived will be in the science industries basically high-tech sciences
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:59.560]  and the rest of the old laboring classes will be unnecessary in the meantime
[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:04.680]  China will supply the labor and the manufacturer to keep essential things
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:09.120]  going until they bring it all down so you're looking literally ahead for another
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:14.480]  40 years step by step by step how we're going through right now is just the
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:19.520]  chaos to get us to amalgamate the continents completely into the regions
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:24.680]  and then to allow a brief time for the United Nations the World Bank to take
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:29.560]  over the Bank for International Settlements and IMF to run the economy and
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:33.520]  distribute the wealth of the world this is what they call it it literally means
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:37.080]  rationing out food under the United Nations they've already said this is in
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:42.120]  a charter eventually the United Nations will be responsible for doling out the
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:48.880]  food to each region and it will be rationed and if you can't if you have
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:53.120]  too many people for the ration that you get and you you must find a way to bring
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:57.320]  down your population that's in their charter yeah and that's the food is a
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:01.520]  weapon the Kissinger so famous for but of course we know Bertrand Russell said
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:06.520]  the same thing John P. Holdren along with his partner over there writing the
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:10.240]  same thing in eco science and yeah it's a hostage situation
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:16.120]  economics money is so we even it's one of the biggest forms of warfare you can
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:21.040]  wipe out a country so quickly by using economy and banking very very quickly
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:25.360]  and of course it's all private banking so with no say in the matter that's why
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:31.880]  they keep it private and and also in ancient times they used economy as well
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:35.280]  they would do embargoes they wouldn't allow any trade coming into or out of a
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:42.040]  city state water waters up programs they want one company eventually to run the
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:46.160]  whole world's water supply the United Nations already has a whole branch
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:51.360]  dedicated to that and same with your food you have five agribusinesses have
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:56.560]  taken over the food supply of the entire planet so this is all part of this
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:42:02.800]  global system of where they will distribute wealth also power is a big
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:07.960]  one in the 1930s they first a group first came out with this idea that all
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:12.120]  labor and money anyway anyway is is simply energy in one form or another and
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:17.120]  so they came out with to not technocracy and they said that eventually
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:22.200]  they'd also own all energy supplies that's why a company that runs your
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:25.960]  electricity for instance is an argumenting to with the big boys or
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:30.520]  global boys all the time and they will ration your power depending on the area
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.040]  region you live in or your social status you won't need much if you're at the
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:39.320]  bottom as with the claim and and they won't lose money and profit off of it
[02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:43.400]  because they can ration they can cut you by half consumption and charge you
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:47.720]  twice as much if they want to and so they would all sewn up and this is the
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:56.720]  problem in the so-called free trade type deal where big corporations are
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:01.120]  allowed to amalgamate and consolidate monopolize in other words whole areas
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:05.520]  of everything you need to per survival understand what we're talking about here
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:11.880]  it's an overall war plan a very old war and like all wars you must look at
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:16.600]  history ancient history to the present and use the same techniques and update
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:23.160]  them for the present circumstances and and you cannot lose if you have a big
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:29.840]  big top at the top all bound together by social status hereditary status a lot
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:35.560]  of them financial status and they were brought up in the best private schools
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:40.520]  and and universities they're all they all joined the same clubs this great
[02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:44.720]  great great grandpa and and these guys get together with the council and
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:49.800]  foreign relations and literally do their bit for the big overall agenda
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:54.120]  remember that the Royal Institute of International Affairs is the parent
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:58.720]  company of the CFR they couldn't call it the Royal Institute of the American
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:02.520]  Affairs who have gone down well so they called it the CFR that's the American
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:06.640]  branch they've a branch across the entire planet in every country now they
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:10.280]  have a branch dedicated just for the European Union every top politicians
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:15.000]  member of it and they take their orders from the top they must always get on
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.040]  board with consensus regardless of the the party they are the leanings they
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:24.080]  have and quickly said that we take on communists we take on socialists we
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:29.760]  take on fascists we take on dictators they're all part of the same system but
[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:34.520]  they must all agree and come together together to agree on after the big
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:38.920]  meetings to go along it with consensus on specific areas and that's what they
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:43.440]  do obviously said quite a bit there but I want to go back to the way you were
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:47.720]  talking about them gaming the energy industry and gaming technology
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:51.840]  essentially is planning the buffet of options and then preparing the response
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:55.000]  ahead of time so no matter what they choose they're ready to go and I know
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:59.640]  you've talked before about how they use the deregulation climate to move forward
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:04.320]  things a certain football field of steps and then when they switch things back
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:08.480]  over I know across the world as Keynesianism kind of lost its favor in
[02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:12.960]  certain areas they brought in the kind of deregulated Margaret Thatcher Reagan
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:16.240]  looking thing but they've been gaming both sides of it all along and
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:21.840]  centrally planning it yes and actually as I say that the politicians I I bypass
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:26.600]  that my personal opinion I bypass all political politicians because quickly
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:32.000]  has been proven quite correct that every president every prime minister and the
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:38.200]  major countries across the whole world since the late 1880s has been a member
[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:44.280]  of this organization that we now know as a CFR Canada changed its name for
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:47.040]  their group recently because so many folk were talking about them to simply
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:51.320]  change the name of its the same group and they're all in chief international
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:55.840]  affairs it was started up remember by the most wealthy people of the period of
[02:45:55.840 --> 02:46:01.160]  the 1800s and the first of course at the Cecil Rhodes Foundation and Cecil
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:04.080]  Rhodes was in partnership with Lord Rothschild to take over the world's
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:09.840]  wealth he said that in his own diaries to take over the mineral and gold and
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:13.880]  silver and water all the resources of the world that was the purpose of it
[02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:18.360]  and then then he cramped a morphed into their own initiative international
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:22.680]  affairs when they joined with the Milner group the Milner group Lord Alfred
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:30.240]  Milner who was from Germany he would they were comprised of bankers top top
[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:34.680]  bankers of the time as international lenders not just your local banks and
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:39.960]  they joined with the Rhodes Society to perform their ownership international
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:45.960]  affairs the scientific branch is a royal society that's also part of it so the
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:49.880]  whole farce of giving the public democracy was just that they were given
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:55.680]  royal charters to set up a parallel government which they did and they plan
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:46:59.440]  the world in centuries they plan the populations so it's going to be a
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:04.880]  problem with them what do we do in a post industrial society with the
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:08.360]  populations they don't believe in keeping pets around but you know pet
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:12.160]  animals it used to be farm animals they don't believe turning them into pets so
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.240]  they're economically minded there for sustainability and their own their own
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:21.800]  survival sustainability means their survival at the expense of everyone else
[02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:28.240]  is incredible and yeah of course on the food they've been using just as Bertrand
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:32.880]  Russell wrote diet and injections the genetically modified food the BPA and
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:36.360]  other chemicals they put into the food containers and the stuff they put in
[02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:40.640]  vaccines how much is that going to contribute to the depopulation as much
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:45.200]  as the kind of overt tactics of literal population management through food it
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:50.000]  already has I mean we've been living through it since about the 50s with
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.520]  studying with the polio vaccines and all the killer viruses that were in them
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:58.040]  some of the cancer viruses that's all they do is cause cancer they knew that
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:04.880]  the time like the 70 and 40 that's all admitted it's out there and and of
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:07.440]  course they always broke cover on saying well we didn't think it would do that
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:12.560]  much harm which is nonsense because at the end of World War two you find the
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:16.720]  king of England actually had a world meeting with the US and other countries
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:20.640]  to decide to bring down the populations even further because the war hadn't
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:24.680]  killed off enough people that's that's that's main stream you can find that in
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:29.000]  history books so they went after they don't ask for volunteers who's going to
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:34.560]  volunteer for sterilization to be dumbed down and to die early it doesn't
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:39.960]  happen so they go ahead with it and you actually get glimpses of that if we
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:45.440]  Charles Galton Darwin's book the next million years he's a physicist the
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:50.360]  Manhattan Project scientist and he came out with this book about the next
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:54.560]  million years of rulership this is the kind of boast he was giving but he said
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:59.400]  the elite must go on the physically and more mentally superior must go on at
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:03.120]  the expense of all the rest and then he came out with ways to dumb down the
[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:07.720]  public he said even the one the best ways to get rid of that aggression the
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:12.920]  fighting aggression in the mail was to find ways of putting in estrogen and
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:18.440]  hormones into the food or the water or into inoculations are all three now
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:22.760]  this is a top top world renowned scientist who was at the pinnacle with
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:27.440]  all of the world meetings at the time on depopulation coming out openly with the
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:32.920]  agenda and we are living through it the cancer rates skyrocketed from when I was
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:37.640]  young and interesting enough they just come out with an article from the World
[02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:42.040]  Health Organization saying now that they're opening up the the Far East
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:47.680]  countries and and the lower economies the lower countries now that we're
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:51.000]  opening them up there's going to be a huge explosion in those countries of
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:56.240]  cancer just like that just suddenly you know not telling you why but of course
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:59.760]  we're going to introduce all of the food injections then the UNESCO comes in
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:02.680]  first with the World Health Organization and make sure that they all get
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:06.200]  their injections first that's prime because that's the one that targets the
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:12.000]  brain and drops the old IQ points of a few you know a few points down it's
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:17.840]  incredible there's a war nothing is by accident here now they really do just set
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:22.200]  the stage to unleash a certain amount of energy and energy build it up and then
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:26.800]  they soak it back up economically and through our very lifehood and you know
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:29.920]  we're just going to wake up with a demographic winter no one could have
[02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:34.160]  children and you pay for access to have the children you can't have and the
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:39.200]  cancer it's disgusting Alan I know you know this but still sinks in we'll be

[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:26.320]  segment I've been Aaron Dyke sitting in till Alex is back tomorrow but I do want
[02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:30.320]  to remind you about the info wars nightly news we've only been added just a
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:34.360]  little over two weeks and we are really just getting started five nights a week
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:38.040]  we're going to put really some of our best material into that condensed
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:41.520]  format we've already brought you news packages they're going to get bigger and
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:45.640]  better and the guests have only just started to roll in we get kind of an
[02:54:45.640 --> 02:54:51.920]  intimate Skype-based sit-down with these people to pick their brains so tune
[02:54:51.920 --> 02:54:55.960]  into that and if you're not a subscriber I really think you might want to be Alan
[02:54:55.960 --> 02:54:59.320]  I want to give you the floor for the remaining minutes but you mentioned the
[02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:05.120]  perpetual war which of course in many ways comes out of Orwell's 1984 largely
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:09.760]  a critique of that sort of Fabian sect of socialism the incremental slow
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:14.760]  socialism we surround the population and herd them into these controlled areas and
[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:20.480]  so I know also meshing with that Julian Huxley the first head of UNESCO really
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:24.560]  he wrote in his own way about the clash of cultures the synthesis that would
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:29.280]  come from kind of the West clashing then with the Soviets but isn't it the same
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:33.120]  today with the Middle East and what do you see on the horizon for the Middle
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:39.680]  East really existing that have a different culture a different system
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:44.240]  they used to have no usury at all which is a handy thing you have it but of
[02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:48.200]  course everyone must be standardized into the one system whether they like it or
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:52.120]  not and if you don't like it they simply get bombed into it and then in comes
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:57.040]  UNESCO the IMF and all around the World Bank and the loans and this this fake
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:01.000]  front called democracy because we've never had democracy that's the truth of
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:06.080]  the whole matter but I could show of course because it keeps the public see
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:10.000]  if it didn't give you democracy and at the chance you vote every four or five
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:14.200]  years they know you'd have revolutions that's why they created democracy this
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:19.400]  this front of democracy that's the really intention behind it and you don't
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:22.400]  vote in a new bunch thinking they're going to be bet you hope you hope it will
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:26.960]  be better but you they're voting out the last bunch or so sick of them and that's
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:30.520]  really what it's based upon is it's simply a safety valve and hope lives in
[02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:33.960]  hope it's going to get better that your life's experience should tell you that
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:38.280]  nothing nothing's been getting better regardless of who's in it's always been
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:43.520]  getting worse because it's a plan it's nothing to do with the politics as I
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:46.520]  say they're there for there's a punch in Judy show you throw tomatoes at them
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:51.880]  this is to do with a private organization running the world run by very
[02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:59.080]  powerful wealthy intelligent very old family to people and and this is a this
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:03.560]  is the world agenda each G wells wrote about this in the 1920s right down to
[02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:08.880]  eventually killing off in what goes with inferior genes simply by stylizing
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:13.080]  them it says it's most humane way to do it is this stellar the gene pools will die
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:17.480]  off that way then fewer pools and then you're left with a better types and
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:21.600]  reduced population that's what he said and even talked about bringing in wind
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:27.200]  mills and of course the rationing of power 1920s Fabian society another
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:31.960]  branch of the launch of international affairs it's not the news headlines of
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:35.280]  the day they quickly grab your attention but Alan really knows what he's talking
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:38.440]  about if you read the literature for yourself you'll be getting on that
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:41.960]  standard too and that's the only way we're ever going to get any of this back
[02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:45.600]  because as he said they have a plan and they're prepared for the opposition and
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:49.920]  they're ready to essentially iron us into uniformity Alan I want to thank you
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:54.120]  so much for joining us today your insights are very valuable and I hope we
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:59.040]  have you on the info wars nightly news show coming up soon that's about it for
