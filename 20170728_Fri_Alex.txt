[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:30.000 --> 00:56.400]  It is Friday, July 28, 2017. I'm Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones. Huge show today.
[00:56.400 --> 01:01.920]  We've got Tommy Robinson coming up in the second hour. He's got a new book out telling
[01:01.920 --> 01:06.400]  people what's really in the Quran, the truth about the religion of peace. That's going
[01:06.400 --> 01:10.680]  to be interesting in the second hour. For the time being, we've got big breaking news
[01:10.680 --> 01:16.960]  terror in Germany has struck again. This isn't really being reported by many of the big news
[01:16.960 --> 01:22.560]  agencies because they'd rather just gloss over it and pretend everything's hunky-dory
[01:22.560 --> 01:28.720]  in Merkel land as she imports millions more refugees. One killed, multiple injured in
[01:28.720 --> 01:33.840]  Hamburg knife attack that is out of arty. One person has been killed and several others
[01:33.840 --> 01:40.080]  injured in a bloody knife attack at a supermarket in Hamburg, Germany. According to local police,
[01:40.080 --> 01:45.760]  the suspect has been arrested. However, officials have declined to comment on a possible motive.
[01:45.760 --> 01:52.560]  Oh, gee, I wonder. No possible motive suspected here, despite the fact that the eyewitnesses
[01:53.120 --> 02:00.400]  on the scene said that this individual shouted, you guessed it, Allah Akbar during the rampage.
[02:00.400 --> 02:06.080]  So we have at least one person dead right now, several injured. It looks like the suspect has
[02:06.080 --> 02:13.200]  thankfully been apprehended. It looks like yet another Islamic terror attack in Merkel land,
[02:13.200 --> 02:20.240]  the land of 2 million plus refugees, economic migrants in reality since 2015. And just look
[02:20.240 --> 02:24.560]  at what is happening. We're going to get more into that later in regards to the migrant crisis
[02:24.560 --> 02:30.080]  because there is just a deluge of news on that. Also breaking at this hour though,
[02:30.080 --> 02:35.760]  this is also out of arty, North Korea believed to have conducted a new missile test. North Korea
[02:35.760 --> 02:39.760]  is believed to have conducted a new missile test, Japanese National Public Broadcaster
[02:39.760 --> 02:46.880]  NHK reported today, citing government officials. It looks like it landed in the Sea of Japan once
[02:46.880 --> 02:53.760]  again. Whether this will be the spark that entails new military action potentially against North
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.720]  Korea will wait and see usually doesn't does it usually just drags on until the next missile incident.
[02:59.280 --> 03:05.600]  And nothing really happens. Tensions continue to simmer. But that is also breaking at this hour.
[03:05.600 --> 03:11.920]  Now one of the top stories up on infowars.com right now is a new development on a story we've
[03:11.920 --> 03:18.160]  been tracking all week. The headline is pastor confirms plot to take out Trump is physical.
[03:18.880 --> 03:25.200]  As the deep state democratic coup against the legitimately elected president intensifies,
[03:25.200 --> 03:30.880]  we have more details on this potential assassination plot against the president
[03:30.880 --> 03:37.120]  being cooked up from within the dark underbelly of the deep state. This is of course pastor
[03:37.120 --> 03:43.280]  Rodney Howard Brown who appeared on the show with Alex a couple of days ago after he went public
[03:43.280 --> 03:50.000]  with how he was told by a senior republican congressman of a plot to quote take out president
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.040]  Trump in the near future. Now he's made it even more explicit in these new comments that that meant
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.400]  to physically remove the president, not through indictment, not through impeachment,
[04:02.400 --> 04:08.240]  not through some kind of political protest to physically remove the president. He went on
[04:08.240 --> 04:14.640]  to talk about the John Hinckley Jr assassination attempt against Ronald Reagan, how that changed
[04:14.640 --> 04:21.440]  Ronald Reagan's direction back in the 80s. So again, whether this supposed assassination plot,
[04:21.440 --> 04:26.640]  and we've been talking about this story for months now, given how the media, given how
[04:26.640 --> 04:32.080]  the dominant culture is placing this in the public's mind that this is inevitable that
[04:32.080 --> 04:37.440]  someone will try and assassinate Donald Trump, given that build up, given that lead up,
[04:38.080 --> 04:42.000]  could we see an attempt in the near future? That's what a lot of people are warning about,
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.560]  including this prominent pastor who now has confirmed that this threat, this plan was physical.
[04:48.560 --> 04:54.240]  Of course, he was interrogated to some extent by the Secret Service after he made these comments.
[04:54.240 --> 04:57.920]  He actually made them over a week ago. It only really intensified when
[04:58.720 --> 05:04.480]  infowars.com picked up the story, but he's now confirming that that is a physical plot. We'll
[05:04.480 --> 05:10.880]  be back after the break with more news infowars.com. All the perplexities, the confusion and distress
[05:10.880 --> 05:15.920]  in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want
[05:15.920 --> 05:21.280]  of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and
[05:21.280 --> 05:26.560]  circulation. Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States. Are
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.680]  you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[05:31.680 --> 05:37.040]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[05:37.040 --> 05:41.680]  and to profit from it? What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have
[05:41.680 --> 05:46.640]  over the American people? Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our
[05:46.640 --> 05:52.800]  money? Will you be a slave or will you be free? Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without
[05:52.800 --> 05:58.560]  general knowledge among the people. Join the info wars, spread the information, educate yourself
[05:58.560 --> 06:02.640]  and others. The truth shall set you free.
[06:02.640 --> 06:16.640]  I'm David Knight.
[06:32.640 --> 06:58.640]  I'm David Knight.
[06:58.640 --> 07:24.640]  I'm David Knight.
[07:24.640 --> 07:50.640]  I'm David Knight.
[07:50.640 --> 08:16.640]  I'm David Knight.
[08:16.640 --> 08:44.640]  I'm David Knight.
[08:44.640 --> 09:12.640]  I'm David Knight.
[09:12.640 --> 09:26.960]  We are live. This is the Alex Jones show with me. Paul Joseph Watson. Now. What's the biggest story
[09:26.960 --> 09:33.120]  in the United States right now? Is it the fight, the three way would be cage match between
[09:33.120 --> 09:40.240]  Scaramucci, Bannon and Ryan Spreibus? No. Is it the Russian collusion? Nothing burger. No. It's actually
[09:40.240 --> 09:43.180]  This, which has received no attention whatsoever
[09:43.180 --> 09:46.760]  from any other mainstream network than Fox News,
[09:46.760 --> 09:50.400]  despite the fact that this is clearly the most intriguing,
[09:50.400 --> 09:52.360]  most potentially damaging,
[09:52.360 --> 09:55.820]  the biggest story that has emerged this week.
[09:55.820 --> 09:58.280]  This is out of gateway pundit to set the scene.
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.180]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, absolute wreck,
[10:02.180 --> 10:07.180]  barely able to function since Imran Awan arrest.
[10:07.360 --> 10:08.740]  Now, to give you the backstory,
[10:08.740 --> 10:11.680]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former head of the DNC,
[10:11.680 --> 10:14.720]  employed Pakistani IT staffers and brothers
[10:14.720 --> 10:17.100]  who were paid over $4 million
[10:17.100 --> 10:18.440]  over the course of their employment,
[10:18.440 --> 10:22.320]  even though they were accused of a cyber security breach.
[10:22.320 --> 10:24.360]  Number of other criminal accusations
[10:24.360 --> 10:25.760]  against one of the brothers as well,
[10:25.760 --> 10:27.440]  which we'll get into later,
[10:27.440 --> 10:31.800]  Imran Awan was arrested after he attempted to flee the US
[10:31.800 --> 10:36.800]  after wiring approximately $300,000 to Pakistan.
[10:36.800 --> 10:39.720]  And again, Fox News is the only cable network
[10:39.720 --> 10:41.400]  covering this huge scandal.
[10:41.400 --> 10:43.120]  When Imran Awan was arrested,
[10:43.120 --> 10:46.240]  he was carrying $12,000 of cash on him.
[10:46.240 --> 10:47.920]  That's not suspicious at all.
[10:47.920 --> 10:50.840]  His wife was carrying $12,000 of cash as well
[10:50.840 --> 10:53.080]  when she fled the country.
[10:53.080 --> 10:57.080]  So basically, these individuals had high security access
[10:57.080 --> 10:58.760]  to the DNC computers.
[10:58.760 --> 11:02.160]  They had the password to Wasserman Schultz's iPad.
[11:02.160 --> 11:04.820]  They had direct access to all that.
[11:04.820 --> 11:07.120]  The guy smashed his hard drive
[11:07.120 --> 11:09.800]  before the FBI was able to descend on him.
[11:09.800 --> 11:11.800]  This is a massive scandal.
[11:11.800 --> 11:13.440]  Now it turns out,
[11:13.440 --> 11:15.360]  and we're gonna get to this clip in a moment,
[11:15.360 --> 11:18.000]  that this has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.640]  with these individuals potentially colluding
[11:21.640 --> 11:24.080]  with a terrorist organization
[11:24.080 --> 11:28.080]  while having direct access, secure access to the DNC.
[11:28.080 --> 11:31.000]  You wanna talk about collusion with a foreign power.
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.600]  You wanna talk about collusion
[11:32.600 --> 11:35.520]  with a foreign terrorist entity.
[11:35.520 --> 11:37.800]  This is it, right here.
[11:37.800 --> 11:40.120]  There's more evidence for this
[11:40.120 --> 11:42.720]  than there is for Russian collusion and Donald Trump.
[11:42.720 --> 11:45.640]  Yet that is the story they're talking about on CNN.
[11:45.640 --> 11:48.560]  They then touched this.
[11:48.560 --> 11:49.800]  Now we go back to March,
[11:49.800 --> 11:51.920]  and we've got this video clip lined up.
[11:51.920 --> 11:54.960]  When this investigation first emerged, bearing in mind,
[11:54.960 --> 11:57.640]  she actually employed these guys after this
[11:57.640 --> 11:59.660]  for months afterwards.
[11:59.660 --> 12:01.800]  The headline, the original Daily Call headline
[12:01.800 --> 12:03.040]  from back in March,
[12:03.040 --> 12:05.000]  Wasserman Schultz threatened police chief
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.160]  for gathering evidence on her IT staffers alleged crimes.
[12:09.160 --> 12:12.360]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief
[12:12.360 --> 12:14.640]  of the US Capitol Police with quote,
[12:14.640 --> 12:16.880]  consequences for holding equipment
[12:16.880 --> 12:19.200]  that she says belonged to her.
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.560]  And again, bearing in mind,
[12:20.560 --> 12:21.920]  this is before the evidence
[12:21.920 --> 12:24.680]  of them smashing up hard drives came out.
[12:24.680 --> 12:26.120]  But she says belongs to her
[12:26.120 --> 12:27.480]  in order to build a criminal case
[12:27.480 --> 12:29.160]  against a Pakistani staffer
[12:29.160 --> 12:32.600]  suspected of massive cyber security breaches
[12:32.600 --> 12:37.680]  involving funneling sensitive congressional data off site.
[12:37.680 --> 12:38.800]  Not only off site,
[12:38.800 --> 12:42.160]  but now it turns out potentially directly
[12:42.160 --> 12:44.080]  to the Muslim brotherhood.
[12:44.080 --> 12:47.200]  The Florida lawmaker used her position
[12:47.200 --> 12:50.480]  on the committee that sets the police force's budget
[12:50.480 --> 12:53.480]  to press its chief to relinquish the piece of evidence
[12:53.480 --> 12:55.640]  in what could be considered using her authority
[12:55.640 --> 12:59.520]  to attempt to interfere with a criminal investigation.
[12:59.520 --> 13:02.200]  No scandal about that back in March.
[13:02.200 --> 13:03.560]  Now this has blown up.
[13:03.560 --> 13:06.160]  Let's go back to March and play that clip
[13:06.160 --> 13:08.520]  where Wasserman Schultz directly threatens
[13:08.520 --> 13:11.520]  the Capitol Police with quote, consequences
[13:11.520 --> 13:12.680]  if they don't drop this.
[13:12.680 --> 13:13.520]  Here's the clip.
[13:14.560 --> 13:17.000]  It is not, under my understanding,
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.640]  the Capitol Police is not able to confiscate
[13:19.640 --> 13:21.840]  members equipment when the member
[13:21.840 --> 13:23.520]  is not under investigation.
[13:23.520 --> 13:26.280]  It is their equipment and it's supposed to be returned.
[13:27.280 --> 13:29.920]  I think there's extenuating circumstances in this case.
[13:29.920 --> 13:33.920]  And I think that working through my counsel
[13:33.920 --> 13:38.200]  and the necessary personnel,
[13:38.200 --> 13:40.080]  if that in fact is the case
[13:40.080 --> 13:43.600]  and with the permission of through the investigation
[13:43.600 --> 13:45.120]  and will return the equipment.
[13:45.120 --> 13:46.720]  But until that's accomplished,
[13:46.720 --> 13:48.800]  I can't return the equipment.
[13:48.800 --> 13:50.320]  I think you're violating the rules
[13:50.320 --> 13:53.600]  when you conduct your business that way
[13:53.600 --> 13:56.080]  and should expect that there will be consequences.
[13:57.680 --> 13:59.920]  There you have it, consequences.
[13:59.920 --> 14:03.920]  Four months later, this guy has smashed up his hard drive.
[14:03.920 --> 14:08.680]  He's fled the country after wiring nearly $300,000
[14:08.680 --> 14:12.440]  from the Congressional Federal Credit Union to Pakistan.
[14:12.440 --> 14:14.200]  Now we're finding out he has links,
[14:14.200 --> 14:16.680]  direct links with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[14:16.680 --> 14:20.400]  She employed him for months after this investigation began.
[14:20.400 --> 14:22.960]  Here's another headline out of Gateway Pundit.
[14:22.960 --> 14:24.160]  That's weird.
[14:24.160 --> 14:27.320]  Wasserman Schultz paid Imran Awan for five months
[14:27.320 --> 14:29.800]  after he was banned from house computers.
[14:29.800 --> 14:32.320]  Why is she still employing this guy?
[14:32.320 --> 14:35.280]  Multiple criminal charges leveled against him.
[14:35.280 --> 14:37.000]  Now he's wired 300,000.
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.680]  He's tried to flee the country.
[14:38.680 --> 14:40.640]  He's smashed up his hard drives.
[14:40.640 --> 14:42.440]  What on earth is going on here?
[14:42.440 --> 14:44.840]  Why is nobody reporting on this?
[14:44.840 --> 14:47.160]  Three brothers who managed office IT
[14:47.160 --> 14:49.760]  for government officials were relieved of their duties
[14:49.760 --> 14:51.960]  in February on suspicion
[14:51.960 --> 14:54.000]  that they accessed specific computer networks
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.280]  without permission, also known as hacking.
[14:57.280 --> 14:59.640]  And again, remember the entire hysteria we've had
[14:59.640 --> 15:01.280]  for the past six, seven, eight months
[15:01.280 --> 15:04.120]  is Russia hacked the DNC.
[15:04.120 --> 15:06.960]  Well, here we have individuals with direct ties
[15:06.960 --> 15:09.240]  to terrorist organizations,
[15:09.240 --> 15:11.560]  also with direct access to the DNC,
[15:11.560 --> 15:13.480]  literally with the passwords.
[15:13.480 --> 15:16.000]  This is the biggest scandal since Seth Rich.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.120]  It's getting no attention whatsoever,
[15:18.120 --> 15:21.200]  nowhere near the attention it should have received.
[15:21.200 --> 15:25.120]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz continued to pay Imran Awan
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.120]  for five months for IT services
[15:28.120 --> 15:31.280]  after he was banned from house computers.
[15:31.280 --> 15:33.160]  According to reports earlier this week,
[15:33.160 --> 15:35.800]  Imran Awan was still employed by Wasserman Schultz
[15:35.800 --> 15:38.480]  after his arrest on Monday night.
[15:38.480 --> 15:40.520]  David Dameron spokesman for Wasserman Schultz
[15:40.520 --> 15:43.360]  told Fox News reporter Chad Pergram
[15:43.360 --> 15:45.800]  that Awan was terminated on Tuesday.
[15:45.800 --> 15:47.680]  Five months after this came out,
[15:47.680 --> 15:49.400]  he was still employed by her.
[15:49.400 --> 15:52.760]  So why was Imran still being paid?
[15:52.760 --> 15:55.880]  Wasserman Schultz has some explaining to do.
[15:55.880 --> 15:58.080]  Fast forward to last night
[15:58.080 --> 16:00.560]  where Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaeffer appeared
[16:00.560 --> 16:02.840]  on Tucker Carlson show hosted
[16:02.840 --> 16:05.000]  by a fill-in host Laura Ingram.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.560]  Just when you thought the case surrounding the Awan brothers
[16:09.560 --> 16:13.200]  could not get any darker, a new piece of news emerges.
[16:13.200 --> 16:15.400]  What Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaeffer revealed
[16:15.400 --> 16:19.080]  to Laura Ingram, the Pakistani IT staffers
[16:19.080 --> 16:22.320]  were sending sensitive information
[16:22.320 --> 16:24.760]  to the Muslim brotherhood.
[16:24.760 --> 16:26.520]  Let's go to the clip.
[16:26.520 --> 16:28.960]  So that's why the Capitol Hill police rolled in
[16:28.960 --> 16:30.280]  saying there's something wrong here.
[16:30.280 --> 16:32.120]  And now the FBI has rolled in.
[16:32.120 --> 16:35.640]  And let me give you the big takeaway here.
[16:35.640 --> 16:37.400]  It looks like a foreign intelligence service
[16:37.400 --> 16:39.200]  may be the recipient of all this
[16:39.200 --> 16:41.920]  and something called the Muslim brotherhood.
[16:41.920 --> 16:44.480]  So, the Muslim brotherhood.
[16:44.480 --> 16:45.520]  Oh, they're going to really say
[16:45.520 --> 16:46.840]  it's conspiracy theory now.
[16:46.840 --> 16:47.680]  It's really a conspiracy now,
[16:47.680 --> 16:49.480]  but that's where apparently all this has been going
[16:49.480 --> 16:50.320]  in law enforcement.
[16:50.320 --> 16:52.200]  That's why the FBI is now investigating
[16:52.200 --> 16:53.240]  beyond the waterfall.
[16:53.240 --> 16:55.280]  Well, these brothers have been kicking around Capitol Hill
[16:55.280 --> 16:57.960]  in various capacities for IT.
[16:57.960 --> 16:59.880]  But they essentially were blacklisted
[16:59.880 --> 17:02.480]  by most of the other Democrats, correct?
[17:02.480 --> 17:05.320]  But yet she found, she gave them a home.
[17:05.320 --> 17:06.160]  She gave them a home.
[17:06.160 --> 17:07.000]  Very interesting.
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.520]  And they actually suspended most of their access
[17:08.520 --> 17:11.040]  in February of this year and she kept them on anyway.
[17:11.040 --> 17:11.880]  So...
[17:11.880 --> 17:12.720]  She's just a very nice person.
[17:12.720 --> 17:14.960]  Apparently it's a jobs program over there at the DNC.
[17:14.960 --> 17:16.960]  I guess that $300,000 has been kicked over to Pakistan.
[17:16.960 --> 17:17.800]  Finally was destroyed.
[17:17.800 --> 17:18.680]  It broke the kennel's back.
[17:18.680 --> 17:19.720]  But his wife is gone.
[17:19.720 --> 17:21.560]  She's safely over there in Pakistan.
[17:21.560 --> 17:22.400]  And he was playing.
[17:22.400 --> 17:23.360]  Keep covering it for us.
[17:23.360 --> 17:25.800]  Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer, thank you so much.
[17:25.800 --> 17:27.520]  So there you have it.
[17:27.520 --> 17:30.600]  Direct connections feeding intel to the Muslim brotherhood
[17:30.600 --> 17:34.680]  while having secure high level access within the DNC,
[17:34.680 --> 17:37.440]  wiring $300,000 to Pakistan,
[17:37.440 --> 17:39.960]  smashing up hard drives.
[17:39.960 --> 17:41.360]  Bear in mind the Muslim brotherhood
[17:41.360 --> 17:44.960]  is basically the umbrella, the parent organization,
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.040]  the terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and Hamas.
[17:48.040 --> 17:50.480]  Looks like these guys are working for them.
[17:50.480 --> 17:53.080]  And they're running Debbie Wasserman-Schultz
[17:53.080 --> 17:56.080]  and the DNC's IT.
[17:56.080 --> 17:58.920]  With direct password to her iPad,
[17:58.920 --> 18:00.640]  to all the secure systems.
[18:00.640 --> 18:04.560]  How is that not a massive foreign government,
[18:04.560 --> 18:08.240]  foreign terrorist organization, collusion scandal?
[18:08.240 --> 18:10.480]  That is absolutely huge.
[18:10.480 --> 18:12.280]  That is a giant scandal.
[18:12.280 --> 18:13.960]  Bigger than anything that's come out
[18:13.960 --> 18:17.080]  of this Russia-Trump collusion investigation.
[18:17.080 --> 18:18.720]  It's being covered nowhere.
[18:18.720 --> 18:21.120]  Fox News, and that is it.
[18:21.120 --> 18:23.480]  I mean, the conservative media,
[18:23.480 --> 18:26.160]  the online media have been talking about it all week,
[18:26.160 --> 18:29.520]  relentlessly, trying to push it into the headlines,
[18:29.520 --> 18:33.040]  trying to force the likes of CNN just to cover it,
[18:33.040 --> 18:34.800]  even if it's to dismiss it.
[18:34.800 --> 18:37.200]  Nothing, nothing whatsoever.
[18:37.200 --> 18:38.600]  Now this gets even more bizarre
[18:38.600 --> 18:42.440]  because Imran Awan's attorney actually came out
[18:42.440 --> 18:46.400]  and his defense, even after the smashed up hard drives,
[18:46.400 --> 18:48.920]  wiring $300,000 to Pakistan,
[18:48.920 --> 18:50.600]  the links to the Muslim brotherhood,
[18:50.600 --> 18:53.920]  him and his wife carrying 12 grand in cash
[18:53.920 --> 18:56.440]  through an airport or attempting to,
[18:56.440 --> 18:57.640]  even after all that
[18:57.640 --> 19:00.120]  and all the other criminal charges against him.
[19:01.200 --> 19:04.920]  He blamed Islamophobia, yes, you guessed it.
[19:04.920 --> 19:07.960]  None of that is evidence, ignore all that.
[19:07.960 --> 19:10.080]  No, the reason he's being persecuted,
[19:10.080 --> 19:11.920]  the reason he's being arrested
[19:11.920 --> 19:14.400]  is because of Islamophobia,
[19:14.400 --> 19:17.280]  the right wing and wait for it, wait for it.
[19:17.280 --> 19:18.360]  Pete's a gate.
[19:18.360 --> 19:20.960]  Yes, he actually mentioned Pete's a gate
[19:20.960 --> 19:23.960]  as one of the reasons for this guy being arrested.
[19:23.960 --> 19:26.400]  That's his lawyer's defense.
[19:26.400 --> 19:27.920]  None of these charges are true.
[19:27.920 --> 19:29.480]  None of it even exists.
[19:29.480 --> 19:31.360]  The only reason he's being persecuted
[19:31.360 --> 19:33.320]  is because of Islamophobia.
[19:33.320 --> 19:36.920]  Once again, they turn to identity politics,
[19:36.920 --> 19:41.040]  literally to try to wriggle out of criminal charges,
[19:41.040 --> 19:44.360]  a massive scandal involving foreign collusion,
[19:44.360 --> 19:47.800]  deep access to the IT systems of the DNC
[19:47.800 --> 19:50.760]  and even collusion with a foreign terrorist group.
[19:51.720 --> 19:53.640]  Absolutely huge scandal.
[19:53.640 --> 19:54.760]  There's more on this
[19:54.760 --> 19:56.280]  and we're gonna get to that after the break.
[19:56.280 --> 19:58.400]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live,

[20:00.480 --> 20:02.160]  Don't go away, we'll be back.
[20:02.160 --> 20:07.160]  It's time to get greedy, a real zinc shortage is upon us.

[20:11.080 --> 20:12.960]  zinc supplies are down to three weeks.
[20:12.960 --> 20:15.080]  Mine supplies struggling to meet demand
[20:15.080 --> 20:17.800]  and no major discoveries in the last 22 years.
[20:17.800 --> 20:18.920]  What's it mean for you?

[21:08.720 --> 21:11.360]  finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.

[24:31.560 --> 24:33.280]  We're also going to get back to the huge scandal

[25:08.920 --> 25:09.960]  And why should we?

[26:48.120 --> 26:49.720]  Now, we were talking about the break
[26:49.720 --> 26:53.160]  before the break about the Pakistani IT staffers,
[26:53.160 --> 26:56.280]  one of whom has now been arrested by the FBI
[26:56.280 --> 27:00.000]  after having wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.520]  after having smashed up his hard drives,
[27:02.520 --> 27:05.000]  numerous criminal charges against him.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.640]  Again, he was working with and had direct access
[27:07.640 --> 27:10.800]  to the DNC's computers with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz,
[27:10.800 --> 27:12.840]  had her passwords.
[27:12.840 --> 27:16.880]  Now, the link to the terrorist umbrella organization,
[27:16.880 --> 27:19.840]  the Muslim Brotherhood, has emerged.
[27:19.840 --> 27:22.040]  Oh, but the real reason he's being persecuted
[27:22.040 --> 27:25.400]  according to his lawyer is Islamophobia.
[27:25.400 --> 27:26.240]  That's right.
[27:26.240 --> 27:29.240]  They even mentioned Petergate,
[27:29.240 --> 27:30.680]  which is kind of ironic,
[27:30.680 --> 27:34.000]  given this next story from Gateway Pundit.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.400]  Headline, it gets worse.
[27:35.400 --> 27:38.200]  Wasserman-Schultz IT staffer Imran Awan
[27:38.200 --> 27:43.280]  subscribed to Peterphile-centric YouTube channels.
[27:43.280 --> 27:44.120]  Oh, really?
[27:44.120 --> 27:45.400]  So he's blaming Petergate,
[27:45.400 --> 27:48.640]  which was a scandal and alleged scandal about Peterphiles,
[27:48.640 --> 27:50.320]  and this guy is subscribed
[27:50.320 --> 27:53.480]  to Peterphile-centric YouTube channels, how ironic.
[27:54.320 --> 27:56.560]  With each passing day, we learn more and more
[27:56.560 --> 27:59.600]  about the dark and murky past of Pakistan IT staffer
[27:59.600 --> 28:00.600]  Imran Awan.
[28:00.600 --> 28:03.200]  The former employee of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz
[28:03.200 --> 28:05.720]  is not only being accused of stealing hardware
[28:05.720 --> 28:09.120]  from ranking Democrats and sending sensitive intel
[28:09.120 --> 28:11.760]  to foreign groups like the Muslim Brotherhood,
[28:11.760 --> 28:14.560]  but it now appears Awan may be interested
[28:14.560 --> 28:18.680]  in watching Peterphile-centric YouTube videos.
[28:18.680 --> 28:20.040]  They actually went and looked,
[28:20.040 --> 28:23.080]  and you can do this with anyone who owns a YouTube account.
[28:23.080 --> 28:25.680]  You can look at who they subscribe to.
[28:25.680 --> 28:28.960]  It's a function that can't be hidden as far as I'm aware.
[28:28.960 --> 28:31.080]  Pretty stupid that he didn't try to hide it
[28:31.080 --> 28:34.120]  or didn't try to just unsubscribe from these channels
[28:34.120 --> 28:36.040]  because they're basically disgusting.
[28:36.040 --> 28:37.960]  YouTuber Tracy Beans has discovered
[28:37.960 --> 28:40.320]  that the Pakistani DNC IT staffer
[28:40.320 --> 28:43.440]  rested Monday night for bank fraud
[28:43.440 --> 28:45.160]  while attempting to flee the country,
[28:45.160 --> 28:49.920]  was a fan of several Peterphile-centric YouTube channels,
[28:49.920 --> 28:54.120]  including one featured on Comedy Central's Tosh.0 program.
[28:54.120 --> 28:56.240]  Imran Awan, the longtime employee and friend
[28:56.240 --> 29:00.720]  of Wasserman-Schultz, subscribe to YouTube channel
[29:00.720 --> 29:03.920]  Seven Supergirls, which has over 12 billion views
[29:03.920 --> 29:07.520]  and features children performing in sexualized bits.
[29:07.520 --> 29:10.800]  So as far as I know, these are basically these channels
[29:10.800 --> 29:13.400]  which Google has made moves to shut down,
[29:13.400 --> 29:15.760]  or at least they've been under pressure to shut down,
[29:15.760 --> 29:19.320]  where it's basically sanitized child porn.
[29:19.320 --> 29:23.400]  It's children engaged in sexualized situations.
[29:23.400 --> 29:26.360]  This guy was subscribed to these channels
[29:26.360 --> 29:30.040]  while his lawyer blames conspiracy theorists
[29:30.040 --> 29:32.640]  who complain about pizza gate Peterphiles.
[29:32.640 --> 29:37.640]  He's actually subscribed to Proto-Peterphile YouTube channels.
[29:38.200 --> 29:40.640]  Absolutely insane situation.
[29:40.640 --> 29:42.280]  This is a huge scandal.
[29:42.280 --> 29:44.120]  It has ties into everything.
[29:44.120 --> 29:46.760]  We're learning more every single day.
[29:46.760 --> 29:50.480]  CNN, ABC, MSNBC refuse to cover it.
[29:50.480 --> 29:51.840]  We'll be back after the break.
[29:51.840 --> 29:55.480]  With Roger Stone, don't go anywhere in fourwars.com.
[29:55.480 --> 29:59.320]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:59.320 --> 30:02.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:07.480 --> 30:10.280]  December 23rd, 1776.
[30:10.280 --> 30:12.960]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[30:12.960 --> 30:15.400]  The summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot Wheel
[30:15.400 --> 30:17.960]  in this crisis shrink from the service of their country.
[30:17.960 --> 30:19.640]  But he that stands by it now,
[30:19.640 --> 30:22.680]  deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[30:22.680 --> 30:25.360]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[30:25.360 --> 30:27.400]  Yet we have this consolation with us
[30:27.400 --> 30:30.360]  that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[30:30.360 --> 30:33.360]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[30:33.360 --> 30:36.320]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[30:36.320 --> 30:39.480]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[30:39.480 --> 30:41.240]  And it would be strange indeed
[30:41.240 --> 30:43.400]  if so celestial an article as freedom
[30:43.400 --> 30:45.080]  should not be highly rated.
[30:45.080 --> 30:47.640]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny,
[30:47.640 --> 30:49.400]  has declared that she has a right,
[30:49.400 --> 30:53.440]  not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[30:53.440 --> 30:56.040]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery,
[30:56.040 --> 30:58.600]  then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth.
[30:58.600 --> 31:00.400]  Even the expression is impious,
[31:00.400 --> 31:04.560]  for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[31:04.560 --> 31:07.600]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[31:07.600 --> 31:11.000]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  for up to 25 years
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.320]  and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[31:16.320 --> 31:17.160]  That's right.
[31:17.160 --> 31:19.840]  It's time to build your own food storage
[31:19.840 --> 31:22.080]  with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.

[31:24.360 --> 31:27.400]  and check out this innovative and smart technology
[31:27.400 --> 31:28.760]  that's easy to use.
[31:28.760 --> 31:29.600]  And let me tell you something,
[31:29.600 --> 31:32.600]  it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables,
[31:32.600 --> 31:36.400]  meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[31:36.400 --> 31:37.640]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[31:37.640 --> 31:40.840]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation,
[31:40.840 --> 31:42.640]  like canning or dehydrating,
[31:42.640 --> 31:44.480]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[31:44.480 --> 31:46.360]  there is no comparison.
[31:46.360 --> 31:50.600]  Harvest Right Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste,
[31:50.600 --> 31:52.560]  color, and nutritional value
[31:52.560 --> 31:55.960]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[31:55.960 --> 31:59.400]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[31:59.400 --> 32:01.600]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best,
[32:01.600 --> 32:03.480]  most affordable freeze dryer.

[32:07.560 --> 32:08.720]  Today I'm excited to announce
[32:08.720 --> 32:10.560]  the new limited shipment of DNA horses
[32:10.560 --> 32:13.200]  finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[32:13.200 --> 32:15.680]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list
[32:15.680 --> 32:16.880]  who have signed up for auto-ship
[32:16.880 --> 32:19.280]  to receive out-of-stock products like DNA force.
[32:19.280 --> 32:22.160]  And we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[32:22.160 --> 32:24.480]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game changer
[32:24.480 --> 32:26.240]  like DNA force, we never know
[32:26.240 --> 32:27.800]  when we will be able to secure
[32:27.800 --> 32:29.800]  an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[32:29.800 --> 32:32.760]  The secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup
[32:32.760 --> 32:34.880]  of patented ingredients like CoQ10,
[32:34.880 --> 32:37.760]  systematic enzymes, NAR, lipoic acid,
[32:37.760 --> 32:39.360]  BioPQQ, and many others.
[32:39.360 --> 32:42.080]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented
[32:42.080 --> 32:44.040]  175 clinical studies.
[32:44.040 --> 32:47.760]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.

[33:08.880 --> 33:12.800]  Live from the infoorst.com studios,
[33:12.800 --> 33:15.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:15.880 --> 33:19.880]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[33:19.880 --> 33:24.880]  Don't you find you go on a hillside destiny?
[33:26.360 --> 33:28.400]  We live on the Alex Jones show,
[33:28.400 --> 33:29.440]  top of the next hour.
[33:29.440 --> 33:31.680]  We've got Tommy Robinson coming on.
[33:31.680 --> 33:33.080]  Plus a regular guest.
[33:33.080 --> 33:34.680]  I'm excited to talk to him again.
[33:34.680 --> 33:36.920]  It's been a while, but for the moment,
[33:36.920 --> 33:39.200]  we have another man who needs no introduction.
[33:39.200 --> 33:42.520]  The website is StoneColdTruth.com.
[33:42.520 --> 33:43.440]  It's Roger Stone.
[33:43.440 --> 33:44.880]  Roger, before the break,
[33:44.880 --> 33:46.680]  I was talking about this huge scandal
[33:46.680 --> 33:49.240]  that no one is covering besides Fox News.
[33:49.240 --> 33:54.240]  We have Debbie Wasserman-Schultz as a former IT staffer
[33:54.240 --> 33:58.760]  of the DNC and she only fired him after he was arrested.
[33:58.760 --> 34:01.320]  Months after all these criminal charges were against him,
[34:01.320 --> 34:04.120]  he wires $300,000 to Pakistan.
[34:04.120 --> 34:06.600]  He's found with smashed up hard drives.
[34:06.600 --> 34:08.840]  This is a guy who has direct access
[34:08.840 --> 34:11.680]  to the IT servers at the DNC.
[34:11.680 --> 34:14.320]  He's colluding potentially with the foreign government.
[34:14.320 --> 34:16.200]  He's colluding potentially,
[34:16.200 --> 34:18.160]  as Tony Schaffer said last night,
[34:18.160 --> 34:22.320]  with the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Organization.
[34:22.320 --> 34:25.480]  How on earth is this not a bigger scandal?
[34:25.480 --> 34:27.480]  How on earth are the likes of CNN
[34:27.480 --> 34:29.960]  being able to ignore this huge story?
[34:31.200 --> 34:33.240]  You're absolutely right, Paul, it's extraordinary.
[34:33.240 --> 34:36.000]  In fact, it's even slightly worse than you depicted it.
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.480]  After the Capitol Hill police launched their investigation
[34:39.480 --> 34:42.160]  into these two Pakistani brothers,
[34:42.160 --> 34:45.640]  Deborah Wasserman-Schultz changed their classification
[34:45.640 --> 34:49.840]  from consultants to employees of the House of Representatives
[34:49.840 --> 34:52.920]  to ensure that they would continue to have access
[34:52.920 --> 34:56.120]  to the House of Representatives computer system.
[34:56.120 --> 34:59.560]  So she has abetted whatever they were up to.
[34:59.560 --> 35:01.680]  She refuses to take questions.
[35:01.680 --> 35:04.400]  She berated the Capitol Hill police chief
[35:04.400 --> 35:05.920]  for launching the investigation,
[35:05.920 --> 35:10.120]  demanding a return of the hard drives for office.
[35:10.120 --> 35:13.720]  Interestingly, she also introduced these two brothers
[35:13.720 --> 35:17.800]  to 19 other Democratic members of Congress,
[35:17.800 --> 35:21.240]  who then opened their IT contracts to them,
[35:21.240 --> 35:26.240]  meaning that they burrowed deep into the Democratic caucus
[35:27.120 --> 35:29.480]  getting access to all of that information,
[35:29.480 --> 35:32.520]  including obviously financial information,
[35:32.520 --> 35:35.320]  because the Capitol Hill police investigation
[35:35.320 --> 35:40.320]  was a bank fraud, a electronic wire theft investigation.
[35:42.240 --> 35:44.520]  But where is the Washington Post?
[35:44.520 --> 35:46.320]  Where is the New York Times?
[35:46.320 --> 35:47.520]  Where is CNN?
[35:47.520 --> 35:50.400]  This is as if it didn't even happen.
[35:50.400 --> 35:53.640]  Fortunately, it appears Republicans will nominate
[35:53.640 --> 35:57.640]  Carla Spaulding, Asian American Republican woman,
[35:57.640 --> 36:00.720]  who is a registered nurse, has a master's degree,
[36:00.720 --> 36:03.080]  a single mother with three children,
[36:03.080 --> 36:08.080]  very attractive, very articulate, liberty Republican.
[36:08.080 --> 36:10.880]  And like the race against Maxine Waters,
[36:10.880 --> 36:14.880]  this is going to be about corruption rather than ideology.
[36:17.240 --> 36:21.680]  Now, I wanna talk about the whole Scaramucci controversy,
[36:21.680 --> 36:24.600]  which arose last night out of this New Yorker magazine
[36:24.600 --> 36:27.480]  interview, claims flying on both sides
[36:27.480 --> 36:29.080]  that it should have been off the record.
[36:29.080 --> 36:31.240]  The, of course, the New Yorker writer says
[36:31.240 --> 36:34.440]  it was on the record with Scaramucci throwing shade
[36:34.440 --> 36:38.200]  at Bannon, you've got this kind of three-way
[36:38.200 --> 36:40.040]  would-be cage match going on
[36:40.040 --> 36:43.760]  between Bannon, Reince Priebus and Scaramucci.
[36:43.760 --> 36:46.640]  You've got Breitbart siding with Jeff Sessions
[36:46.640 --> 36:48.920]  siding against Scaramucci.
[36:48.920 --> 36:50.160]  Where do you see the breakdown?
[36:50.160 --> 36:51.840]  Is this gonna split Trump's base?
[36:51.840 --> 36:56.160]  What's going on with this clash of personalities right now?
[36:56.160 --> 36:59.240]  Well, at 2 p.m. today, I'm gonna have an exclusive report
[36:59.240 --> 37:03.120]  for Info Wars, breaking this down in even greater detail
[37:03.120 --> 37:05.760]  because in all honesty, Paul, the situation changes
[37:05.760 --> 37:07.040]  literally by the minute.
[37:07.960 --> 37:12.240]  But so our listeners can understand the battle lines.
[37:12.240 --> 37:15.040]  This is really a two-way fight.
[37:15.040 --> 37:18.240]  Steve Bannon, for reasons that don't really make sense to me,
[37:18.240 --> 37:21.360]  has aligned himself with Reince Priebus
[37:21.360 --> 37:24.720]  and the pragmatist wing of the Trump White House,
[37:24.720 --> 37:29.000]  the so-called Republican establishment loyalists,
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.200]  where Andrew Dice Scaramucci, as we now call him,
[37:33.200 --> 37:36.920]  really stands for undiluted Trumpism,
[37:36.920 --> 37:39.720]  the quaint notion that perhaps we should be appointing people
[37:39.720 --> 37:42.120]  to federal office who are Trump supporters
[37:42.120 --> 37:44.120]  rather than Bush supporters.
[37:45.120 --> 37:47.960]  Bannon, as you know, has,
[37:47.960 --> 37:51.240]  although putting some of the anti-globalist themes
[37:51.240 --> 37:54.080]  before the president helping him in that regard,
[37:54.080 --> 37:56.360]  has aligned himself on personnel matters,
[37:56.360 --> 37:59.840]  largely with the Atlas Priebus,
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.960]  who is now known among many members
[38:02.960 --> 38:07.680]  of the White House staff by the nickname Rancid Penis.
[38:07.680 --> 38:10.040]  It is really breaking down to be a fight
[38:10.040 --> 38:12.920]  between the loyalists to Trump
[38:12.920 --> 38:17.420]  and the pragmatists who Bannon has sadly thrown in with.
[38:18.360 --> 38:21.720]  Meanwhile, I think Reince Priebus' position
[38:21.720 --> 38:23.040]  hangs by a thread.
[38:23.040 --> 38:26.200]  I don't expect him to survive much longer
[38:26.200 --> 38:27.720]  than a day or two.
[38:27.720 --> 38:29.120]  And the real question is,
[38:29.120 --> 38:32.920]  where will the president go in his selection
[38:32.920 --> 38:34.400]  of an alternative?
[38:34.400 --> 38:37.240]  Will he elevate Scaramucci himself
[38:37.240 --> 38:39.640]  to the chief of staff position?
[38:39.640 --> 38:42.760]  Will he choose someone like David Urban,
[38:42.760 --> 38:45.320]  who ran the Pennsylvania campaign,
[38:45.320 --> 38:49.240]  a decorated war veteran and longtime Capitol Hill veteran
[38:49.240 --> 38:54.040]  known for his savvy and his fierce loyalty to Donald Trump?
[38:54.040 --> 38:56.840]  Or will he turn to General Jack Kelly,
[38:56.840 --> 38:58.680]  who would appear on paper
[38:58.680 --> 39:01.640]  to have the administrative skills for this position,
[39:01.640 --> 39:03.960]  but who has ties to the globalist
[39:03.960 --> 39:06.800]  and who is one of the major proponents
[39:06.800 --> 39:11.800]  of the reignition of the war on drugs by the police state?
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.880]  Is this situation literally changing by the moment?
[39:16.880 --> 39:18.440]  And then sadly, I must tell you,
[39:18.440 --> 39:23.440]  there is the outside kind of dark horse candidate,
[39:23.440 --> 39:26.240]  Dina Habib Powell,
[39:26.240 --> 39:27.560]  just not clear that the president
[39:27.560 --> 39:30.000]  understands her real pedigree
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.120]  in her status as a globalist
[39:32.120 --> 39:34.960]  with ties to Valerie Jarrett,
[39:34.960 --> 39:37.680]  Oma Abedin and Condi Rice.
[39:39.400 --> 39:41.720]  Now, I mean, these situations are always fluid
[39:41.720 --> 39:43.680]  because as we've seen before,
[39:43.680 --> 39:46.240]  President Trump listens to advice from all corners.
[39:46.240 --> 39:47.720]  He can't possibly know everything,
[39:47.720 --> 39:50.760]  which is why these situations are subject to change.
[39:50.760 --> 39:53.360]  Where does Jeff Sessions stand in all this?
[39:53.360 --> 39:56.120]  Because Breitbart has vociferously come out
[39:56.120 --> 39:58.920]  and defended him over the past few days.
[39:58.920 --> 40:02.840]  Trump has gone after Sessions to some extent on Twitter.
[40:02.840 --> 40:05.120]  Some of Trump's base say that's a mistake.
[40:05.120 --> 40:07.800]  Obviously Trump disenfranchised disillusioned
[40:07.800 --> 40:09.760]  with Sessions to some extent.
[40:09.760 --> 40:11.200]  Where do you see this going?
[40:12.480 --> 40:14.000]  Well, the president, I think,
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.080]  is right to be disillusioned with Jeff Sessions.
[40:17.080 --> 40:20.000]  We know that the super secret FISA court
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.120]  rendered essentially a decision
[40:22.120 --> 40:24.320]  at the very end of the Obama administration
[40:24.320 --> 40:26.640]  which certified without any question
[40:26.640 --> 40:30.320]  the mass surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans,
[40:30.320 --> 40:31.680]  including yours truly,
[40:32.880 --> 40:35.520]  for strictly political purposes,
[40:35.520 --> 40:36.560]  we weren't being surveilled
[40:36.560 --> 40:38.640]  because we were in touch with foreign powers
[40:38.640 --> 40:41.680]  or because we were engaged in subversive activities.
[40:41.680 --> 40:44.760]  We were being surveilled because we were for Donald Trump
[40:44.760 --> 40:46.320]  because we are Republicans.
[40:47.440 --> 40:51.880]  And this is a crime 10 times worse than Watergate.
[40:51.880 --> 40:55.840]  And it implicates not only Mr. Clapper,
[40:55.840 --> 40:59.760]  former CIA director John O.,
[40:59.760 --> 41:04.160]  Islamic man, Brennan, Admiral Rogers,
[41:04.160 --> 41:07.280]  Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice.
[41:07.280 --> 41:09.480]  And yes, I think we have to assume
[41:09.480 --> 41:11.400]  Barack Obama himself.
[41:11.400 --> 41:14.320]  What did the president know and when did he know it?
[41:14.320 --> 41:16.160]  It happened on his watch.
[41:16.160 --> 41:18.000]  It is unlikely that he did not know
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.440]  about the widespread unconstitutional, illegal,
[41:22.440 --> 41:26.080]  willful spying on American citizens.
[41:26.080 --> 41:29.480]  Now the question is, where is Jeff Sessions?
[41:29.480 --> 41:32.600]  Why has he done nothing about this?
[41:32.600 --> 41:34.000]  Attorneys I have spoken to,
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.320]  who are an expert in the area,
[41:35.320 --> 41:38.920]  tell me this is a slam dunk criminal indictment
[41:38.920 --> 41:41.760]  that you could take the FISA court document
[41:41.760 --> 41:45.000]  to any grand jury and have an afternoon indictment
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.840]  of all of the culprits, yet Sessions is missing in action.
[41:49.840 --> 41:51.320]  He's done nothing.
[41:51.320 --> 41:54.640]  Then you have the question of Bill and Hillary Clinton
[41:54.640 --> 41:58.440]  and their money scam, the Clinton Foundation.
[41:58.440 --> 41:59.520]  It's not a charity.
[41:59.520 --> 42:02.320]  It was a flush fund for Bill and Hillary
[42:02.320 --> 42:04.120]  and their greedy little daughter.
[42:04.120 --> 42:06.840]  And as you know, Paul, it was the vehicle
[42:06.840 --> 42:10.400]  for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes
[42:10.400 --> 42:13.280]  pertaining to the direct sale of government decisions
[42:13.280 --> 42:15.960]  such as the transfer of control
[42:15.960 --> 42:19.840]  of much of the country's uranium to the Russians.
[42:19.840 --> 42:22.680]  There's the banking scandal, the gas scandal.
[42:22.680 --> 42:26.440]  Once again, Jeff Sessions missing in action.
[42:26.440 --> 42:28.760]  On the other hand, Sessions seems to be dedicated
[42:28.760 --> 42:30.760]  to arresting pot smokers.
[42:30.760 --> 42:34.960]  Anybody in the 29 states that have legalized marijuana
[42:34.960 --> 42:38.200]  for medicinal purposes are in grave danger
[42:38.200 --> 42:41.040]  because Jeff Sessions seems to think
[42:41.040 --> 42:44.360]  that that is a priority, notwithstanding the fact
[42:44.360 --> 42:49.040]  that candidate Trump said very clearly during the campaign
[42:49.040 --> 42:52.400]  that he favored states' rights on this question.
[42:52.400 --> 42:56.520]  Although he himself does not support the use of marijuana,
[42:56.520 --> 42:58.840]  he respected the rights of states and the people
[42:58.840 --> 43:01.440]  in those states to make that decision.
[43:01.440 --> 43:06.000]  So one has to wonder, has Sessions been compromised?
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.880]  I must tell you, with their slipping leadership
[43:08.880 --> 43:12.360]  and their lack of leadership, I don't think Breitbart
[43:12.360 --> 43:15.040]  has the kind of impact that they had
[43:15.040 --> 43:17.480]  back when Bannon was at the helm.
[43:17.480 --> 43:20.440]  Frankly, they have been supplanted by InfoWars
[43:20.440 --> 43:23.720]  as the leading voice of liberty in the nation's capital.
[43:25.600 --> 43:27.600]  There does seem to be a struggle
[43:27.600 --> 43:30.200]  over editorial control taking place at Breitbart.
[43:30.200 --> 43:32.440]  They seem to be going off in several different directions
[43:32.440 --> 43:33.680]  at different times.
[43:33.680 --> 43:36.920]  With Sessions, he could have been influenced, as he said.
[43:36.920 --> 43:38.920]  Of course, you've got the Obama holdovers
[43:38.920 --> 43:41.680]  than ever Trump has working directly against Trump.
[43:41.680 --> 43:43.400]  Then you've got others which probably fall
[43:43.400 --> 43:46.280]  into the category of deer in the headlights,
[43:46.280 --> 43:49.440]  where they're not really vehemently acting as bulldogs
[43:49.440 --> 43:50.440]  for the Trump agenda.
[43:50.440 --> 43:51.800]  They're not getting on the offensive,
[43:51.800 --> 43:52.880]  as they shouldn't be doing.
[43:52.880 --> 43:55.080]  That's what Scaramucci was brought in to do.
[43:55.080 --> 43:56.520]  He's going after the leakers.
[43:56.520 --> 43:59.920]  We have this headline up on infowars.com.
[43:59.920 --> 44:02.840]  Report top FBI lawyer James A. Baker
[44:02.840 --> 44:06.640]  under investigation for leaking classified info to media.
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.320]  FBI General Counsel James Baker, a Comey confidant,
[44:10.320 --> 44:12.280]  is allegedly under a criminal investigation
[44:12.280 --> 44:13.400]  by the Department of Justice
[44:13.400 --> 44:16.240]  for leaking classified information to the media.
[44:16.240 --> 44:19.400]  Roger, is it going to take someone to be put in prison
[44:19.400 --> 44:22.920]  for a very long time for these leaks to dry up
[44:22.920 --> 44:23.920]  and then overnight?
[44:23.920 --> 44:25.280]  Is that what it's going to take
[44:25.280 --> 44:27.400]  and is Scaramucci the man to get it done?
[44:28.480 --> 44:30.640]  Well, I appreciate the sentiment
[44:30.640 --> 44:32.960]  of what Anthony was trying to do.
[44:32.960 --> 44:34.680]  However, the history, as you know,
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.880]  all of finding the leakers by any of our recent presidents
[44:38.880 --> 44:41.000]  has been unsuccessful.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.520]  It's virtually impossible to find out
[44:43.520 --> 44:45.600]  who leaked much of this material.
[44:45.600 --> 44:49.960]  What then happens is those seeking the leakers
[44:49.960 --> 44:52.040]  begin utilizing surveillance
[44:52.040 --> 44:55.120]  and why our traffic used to be known to find them.
[44:55.120 --> 44:58.240]  Before long, we are as bad as they are
[44:58.240 --> 45:02.720]  and civil liberties begin to be violated
[45:02.720 --> 45:06.240]  in a wholesale manner that still never ferrets out
[45:06.240 --> 45:09.480]  those quizlings who are leaking the information.
[45:09.480 --> 45:11.280]  Far better, it seems to me,
[45:11.280 --> 45:15.280]  for sessions to focus on the prosecution
[45:15.280 --> 45:18.560]  of those involved in Obama surveillance
[45:18.560 --> 45:21.160]  as well as the Clinton Foundation.
[45:21.160 --> 45:23.840]  Nothing would destabilize the left
[45:23.840 --> 45:27.600]  more than throwing Barack Obama in prison where he belongs.
[45:27.600 --> 45:30.080]  Nothing would destabilize the left
[45:30.080 --> 45:33.800]  more than the federal marshals kicking in the doors at 5 a.m.
[45:33.800 --> 45:38.800]  to arrest Jared, Rogers, Clapper, Brennan, et al.
[45:40.440 --> 45:43.840]  This is really the answer, in my view,
[45:43.840 --> 45:47.080]  to getting off of defense, getting on offense
[45:47.080 --> 45:50.160]  at bringing the fight to the radical left.
[45:50.160 --> 45:54.200]  Now, in the meantime, I have learned,
[45:54.200 --> 45:57.640]  and I will expand upon this,
[45:57.640 --> 46:01.720]  that Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general
[46:01.720 --> 46:06.480]  who, on his own volition, appointed Robert Mueller
[46:06.480 --> 46:09.960]  a special prosecutor, a special counsel in this case,
[46:09.960 --> 46:12.560]  when no one was clamoring for a special counsel
[46:12.560 --> 46:14.520]  and when, more importantly,
[46:14.520 --> 46:16.160]  there was no evidence of a crime
[46:16.160 --> 46:18.480]  to have a special counsel investigate.
[46:18.480 --> 46:23.160]  So it seems that Robert Mueller's job is to find a crime
[46:23.160 --> 46:25.160]  where it none exists as a pretext
[46:25.160 --> 46:27.640]  for the removal of Donald Trump.
[46:27.640 --> 46:31.200]  Where, you may ask, did Mr. Rosenstein come from?
[46:31.200 --> 46:35.000]  How did he get to the Trump Justice Department?
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.600]  Given his background as a Bush-Clinton operative,
[46:39.600 --> 46:43.080]  it can now be revealed that it was Wright's prebis
[46:43.080 --> 46:47.880]  who was the advocate for the hiring of Mr. Rosenstein.
[46:47.880 --> 46:51.600]  On the recommendation of, I hope you're sitting down,
[46:51.600 --> 46:55.240]  Congressman Elijah Cummings from Baltimore,
[46:55.240 --> 46:59.480]  the black left-wing Democrat with an IQ of around 70,
[46:59.480 --> 47:03.560]  considered by many the single dumbest member of Congress.
[47:03.560 --> 47:06.200]  He doesn't seem to be sure where Russia is,
[47:06.200 --> 47:08.200]  never mind the United States.
[47:08.200 --> 47:10.960]  Now, why, during the transition,
[47:10.960 --> 47:15.360]  would previous take a recommendation from Elijah Cummings?
[47:15.360 --> 47:18.160]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[47:18.160 --> 47:22.120]  Cummings is among the president's most virulent critics,
[47:22.120 --> 47:26.160]  yet that is Rosenstein's patron in this administration.
[47:26.160 --> 47:29.800]  Someone has to question what Mr. Prebis could have taken on.
[47:31.920 --> 47:34.560]  So you're saying that the appointment of Mueller
[47:34.560 --> 47:37.000]  links directly back to previous,
[47:37.000 --> 47:40.720]  and that he potentially knew that by appointing Mueller,
[47:40.720 --> 47:43.400]  this special investigation would lead
[47:43.400 --> 47:45.920]  to the attempted impeachment of Donald Trump,
[47:45.920 --> 47:49.480]  and that the never-Trumpers, the traitors inside
[47:49.480 --> 47:52.000]  the administration knew that from the very beginning
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  and that they were potentially behind it.
[47:55.480 --> 47:58.040]  Well, at a minimum, it's clear that the appointment
[47:58.040 --> 48:03.040]  of Rosenstein tracks directly back to Wright's prebis.
[48:03.600 --> 48:05.360]  Now, it's impossible, of course,
[48:05.360 --> 48:07.920]  for Prebis to know everything.
[48:07.920 --> 48:10.840]  Perhaps he didn't know that Rosenstein would take
[48:10.840 --> 48:15.160]  the opportunity of Jeff Sessions recusal
[48:15.160 --> 48:18.080]  to appoint a special prosecutor,
[48:18.080 --> 48:21.680]  whose only intent is to take Donald Trump down.
[48:21.680 --> 48:25.000]  If you look at the front page of USA Today,
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.480]  it reiterates that Mueller is now going to be looking at
[48:28.480 --> 48:31.920]  real estate transactions and developments
[48:31.920 --> 48:35.680]  of Donald Trump in the period prior to his being
[48:35.680 --> 48:37.280]  a candidate for public office,
[48:37.280 --> 48:40.160]  prior to his entering American politics.
[48:40.160 --> 48:43.320]  And the relevance of that would be what?
[48:43.320 --> 48:46.720]  That's not his charge, that's not the mandate
[48:46.720 --> 48:48.240]  that he's been given.
[48:48.240 --> 48:50.880]  I think it demonstrates that this is just
[48:50.880 --> 48:54.480]  an illegitimate effort to take the president down,
[48:54.480 --> 48:55.400]  no matter what.
[48:56.840 --> 48:59.920]  And that is the subject of an article today,
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.920]  is Trump entering a kill box by Pat Buchanan,
[49:03.920 --> 49:05.720]  where he makes the argument that Trump
[49:05.720 --> 49:07.120]  has been backed into a corner.
[49:07.120 --> 49:10.520]  As he said, Mueller has gone way beyond the Russian collusion.
[49:10.520 --> 49:13.120]  He's not even basically interested in the Russian collusion
[49:13.120 --> 49:13.960]  at this point.
[49:13.960 --> 49:16.200]  He's talking about investigating any financial
[49:16.200 --> 49:17.960]  transaction involving Trump.
[49:17.960 --> 49:19.640]  He's gonna try and dig up something,
[49:19.640 --> 49:21.960]  they're gonna blow it all out of proportion,
[49:21.960 --> 49:24.600]  and that's the way this is about bringing down Trump, Roger.
[49:24.600 --> 49:26.600]  This has nothing whatsoever anymore
[49:26.600 --> 49:29.240]  to do with Russian collusion, right?
[49:29.240 --> 49:32.000]  Absolutely, I think that nails it right on the head.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.520]  The entire Russian collusion delusion has collapsed.
[49:35.520 --> 49:37.440]  They have nothing.
[49:37.440 --> 49:39.840]  The meeting of Donald Trump Jr.,
[49:39.840 --> 49:43.960]  the avid follower of info wars and a true patriot,
[49:43.960 --> 49:46.080]  turns out to be a total set up.
[49:46.080 --> 49:49.920]  We now have photos of this woman Russian lawyer
[49:49.920 --> 49:51.720]  in John McCain's office.
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.120]  We have photos of her attending Clinton demonstrations.
[49:56.120 --> 50:00.440]  We now note that the FBI let her into the country
[50:00.440 --> 50:04.040]  where she had no visa, so she could have this meeting.
[50:04.040 --> 50:05.760]  Can you say set up?
[50:05.760 --> 50:08.200]  Because that's what this smells like more and more.
[50:08.200 --> 50:12.120]  Now, I wanna get your take after the break, Roger,
[50:12.120 --> 50:15.920]  about Obamacare, the so-called Obamacare repeal.
[50:15.920 --> 50:18.520]  We have this headline out of CNS News,
[50:18.520 --> 50:21.400]  Trump, three Republicans and 48 Democrats
[50:21.400 --> 50:25.200]  let the American people down in a 2 a.m. tweet Friday
[50:25.200 --> 50:27.160]  after the Senate failed to pass the so-called
[50:27.160 --> 50:28.680]  skinny healthcare bill.
[50:28.680 --> 50:30.880]  President Trump said, quote, three Republicans
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.440]  and 48 Democrats let the American people down.
[50:33.440 --> 50:36.440]  As I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode,
[50:36.440 --> 50:38.480]  then deal, watch.
[50:38.480 --> 50:40.960]  I'm gonna get Roger Stone's take on that after the break.
[50:40.960 --> 50:43.080]  I'm also gonna talk to him about
[50:43.080 --> 50:45.960]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, who says he was told
[50:45.960 --> 50:50.160]  of a plot to take out President Trump physically.
[50:50.160 --> 50:52.120]  Gonna get Roger's take on that.
[50:52.120 --> 50:53.840]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[50:53.840 --> 50:55.640]  We'll be back after the break.
[50:55.640 --> 50:57.880]  Breaking news at infowars.com.
[50:57.880 --> 50:59.220]  Don't go away.
[50:59.220 --> 51:06.080]  You won't hear me.
[51:06.080 --> 51:06.960]  It's a no-brainer.
[51:06.960 --> 51:09.360]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[51:09.360 --> 51:11.840]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride,
[51:11.840 --> 51:14.640]  pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors,
[51:14.640 --> 51:17.400]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[51:17.400 --> 51:19.360]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[51:19.360 --> 51:20.920]  Get the original, most trusted name
[51:20.920 --> 51:22.960]  in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[51:22.960 --> 51:26.480]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems

[51:35.800 --> 51:38.280]  Any time, any place, any way,
[51:38.280 --> 51:41.400]  radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[51:41.400 --> 51:44.520]  At home, at work, in the car, on smartphones.
[51:44.520 --> 51:48.120]  Over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[51:48.120 --> 51:50.000]  That makes choosing radio is a place
[51:50.000 --> 51:51.640]  to advertise your business.
[51:51.640 --> 51:53.720]  One of the best decisions you can make.

[52:02.880 --> 52:05.400]  Easy, affordable, effective.
[52:06.900 --> 52:10.720]  Myco ZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[52:10.720 --> 52:12.200]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[52:12.200 --> 52:13.800]  It's the anti fungus, anti yeast.
[52:13.800 --> 52:16.280]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[52:16.280 --> 52:18.320]  It's been sold out for months, big waiting list,
[52:18.320 --> 52:20.880]  limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds
[52:20.880 --> 52:22.120]  and to have it be California standards.
[52:22.120 --> 52:23.360]  Nobody's got something that's good.
[52:23.360 --> 52:24.880]  Save 30% off of Myco ZX
[52:24.880 --> 52:26.760]  and get the gut health support back

[52:28.800 --> 52:30.400]  50 billion live in each pill.
[52:30.400 --> 52:32.760]  Probiotic Myco ZX contains seven of the world's
[52:32.760 --> 52:34.760]  most powerful organic and well-crafted ingredients
[52:34.760 --> 52:37.200]  designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast
[52:37.200 --> 52:38.200]  and fungal organisms.
[52:38.200 --> 52:40.360]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast
[52:40.360 --> 52:42.120]  and fungus with Myco ZX.
[52:42.120 --> 52:44.320]  Enforcelife.com before it sells out again.
[52:44.320 --> 52:46.720]  10% off when you choose auto ship.
[52:46.720 --> 52:48.840]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on
[52:48.840 --> 52:51.280]  that have terrible bowel and Crohn's type stuff
[52:51.280 --> 52:53.000]  that didn't exist years ago, now it's epidemic.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.480]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead
[52:54.480 --> 52:55.960]  and come on here and tell you what it did for them
[52:55.960 --> 52:58.320]  because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[52:58.320 --> 53:01.200]  Enforcelife.com, Enforcestore.com
[53:01.200 --> 53:03.600]  or AAA-2533139.
[53:05.400 --> 53:06.920]  A great president once said,
[53:06.920 --> 53:10.480]  the nine most feared words in the English language.
[53:10.480 --> 53:13.160]  I am from the government and I'm here to help.
[53:13.160 --> 53:16.480]  Adequacy of loss, absorbing capacity.
[53:16.480 --> 53:17.800]  You call that help?
[53:17.800 --> 53:19.960]  That's the mandate approved by the G20.
[53:19.960 --> 53:22.080]  The banks can steal your money.
[53:22.080 --> 53:24.240]  Well, they can't steal your gold and silver.
[53:24.240 --> 53:26.520]  That you fully control, you can have it delivered
[53:26.520 --> 53:29.640]  into an IRA and a depository and a lock and key
[53:29.640 --> 53:32.040]  where you can hide it, where no one can find it,
[53:32.040 --> 53:33.280]  not even your wife.
[53:33.280 --> 53:34.120]  What?
[53:34.120 --> 53:34.960]  Sorry, honey.
[53:34.960 --> 53:37.400]  Your CDs, money market accounts
[53:37.400 --> 53:39.560]  and savings accounts are all at risk.

[53:50.800 --> 53:54.360]  800-474-9159.

[53:59.520 --> 54:04.000]  800-474-9159.
[54:04.000 --> 54:19.760]  We are alive on the Alex Jones show.
[54:19.760 --> 54:25.760]  This is the final segment with Roger Stone.
[54:25.760 --> 54:28.760]  Roger, I just wanted to get your quick take on
[54:28.760 --> 54:32.080]  Obamacare because we had the so-called skinny repeal
[54:32.080 --> 54:33.440]  attempt last night.
[54:33.440 --> 54:36.520]  A lot of people, of course, said it was completely pointless,
[54:36.520 --> 54:39.000]  but John McCain and others managed to sink it.
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.360]  What's your take on that?
[54:41.360 --> 54:44.800]  Well, the American people, I think,
[54:44.800 --> 54:47.440]  have to be profoundly disappointed.
[54:47.440 --> 54:49.840]  And now what we're going to get is a classic pointing match
[54:49.840 --> 54:52.160]  where the president blames the Congress
[54:52.160 --> 54:56.000]  and the Congress attempt to blame the president.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.320]  I see an opportunity politically for the president
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.000]  to run against the Congress as Harry Truman did in 1948
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.200]  as the do-nothing Congress.
[55:06.200 --> 55:09.000]  It's not a lack of leadership on the part of the president.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.440]  It's a lack of responsiveness by the Senate Republicans.
[55:13.440 --> 55:16.440]  Also, a classic example,
[55:16.440 --> 55:18.440]  the president has to begin punishing
[55:18.440 --> 55:20.480]  the establishment Republicans.
[55:20.480 --> 55:23.600]  We have a special election coming up in Alabama
[55:23.600 --> 55:27.520]  where Mitch McConnell has the hammerlock on the president
[55:27.520 --> 55:29.160]  squeezing him for the endorsement
[55:29.160 --> 55:32.560]  of establishment candidate Luther Strange.
[55:32.560 --> 55:34.680]  The president should reject that
[55:34.680 --> 55:38.280]  and should make it clear that he will support challengers
[55:38.280 --> 55:40.200]  to sitting Republican senators
[55:40.200 --> 55:44.760]  who will not get on board for the Trump reform agenda.
[55:44.760 --> 55:46.640]  Franklin Roosevelt did this,
[55:46.640 --> 55:49.360]  and it's essential that President Trump do it.
[55:49.360 --> 55:51.640]  He is not a creature of the Republican party.
[55:51.640 --> 55:54.600]  He is a creature of the American people.
[55:54.600 --> 55:57.520]  And if he makes it clear that he's prepared to visit Alaska
[55:57.520 --> 56:00.160]  and will campaign against Lisa Mikowski,
[56:00.160 --> 56:03.000]  that he's prepared to weigh in,
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.480]  there is no evidence that there's any lack of popularity
[56:07.480 --> 56:11.480]  the president among grassroots Republican primary voters.
[56:11.480 --> 56:13.960]  I recently saw a poll in Alabama again
[56:13.960 --> 56:15.520]  where the president's approval rating
[56:15.520 --> 56:19.040]  among Republican primary voters was at 90%.
[56:19.040 --> 56:24.240]  He has more leverage at this point in the Republican party
[56:24.240 --> 56:28.560]  than those in the congressional wing of the party
[56:28.560 --> 56:32.120]  who have betrayed him on the question of healthcare.
[56:34.640 --> 56:36.120]  Okay, I know you've got to get off, Roger.
[56:36.120 --> 56:37.000]  We're going to leave it there.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.200]  The website is stonecoldtruth.com.
[56:40.200 --> 56:41.400]  We'll speak to you again, Roger.
[56:41.400 --> 56:43.240]  Thanks for joining us today.
[56:43.240 --> 56:45.960]  I will be back, too, in an exclusive update
[56:45.960 --> 56:48.760]  on the inter-White House concepts
[56:48.760 --> 56:52.120]  and the struggle for power inside the Trump administration.
[56:53.120 --> 56:57.880]  Okay, we'll be sure to look for that on infowars.com later today.
[56:57.880 --> 56:59.960]  There goes Roger Stone.
[56:59.960 --> 57:01.320]  Just before we hit the next break,
[57:01.320 --> 57:03.200]  I want to tell you about the great specials

[57:51.720 --> 57:53.040]  to take on the mainstream media
[57:53.040 --> 57:56.240]  because we don't have the same sources of funding
[57:56.240 --> 57:57.160]  that they have.
[57:57.160 --> 58:00.640]  We only have this megaphone, this bullhorn.
[58:00.640 --> 58:02.400]  And of course, it's all thanks to you
[58:02.400 --> 58:05.360]  getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[58:05.360 --> 58:09.000]  So please take advantage of those specials today.
[58:10.920 --> 58:12.920]  Going back to what's happening in Hamburg,
[58:12.920 --> 58:15.920]  we have another terror attack in Europe.
[58:15.920 --> 58:17.800]  This is at the London Evening Standard.
[58:17.800 --> 58:19.200]  Hamburg attack, man shouting,
[58:19.200 --> 58:21.120]  Alarak Bar kills one person.
[58:21.120 --> 58:24.120]  Now in just four because they said,
[58:24.120 --> 58:27.360]  oh, who knows what the motive could have been,
[58:27.360 --> 58:30.040]  even though it was reported within minutes
[58:30.040 --> 58:31.880]  that he was shouting, Alarak Bar,
[58:31.880 --> 58:34.120]  they're still saying, oh, who knows?
[58:34.120 --> 58:35.360]  Who knows?
[58:35.360 --> 58:38.800]  Not the religion of peace striking again, surely.
[58:38.800 --> 58:41.160]  Absolutely insane situation in Merkel
[58:41.160 --> 58:43.400]  and we'll get into that more with Tommy Robinson
[58:43.400 --> 58:44.560]  in the next hour.

[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.240]  It is cool to have you brought some info, Alex Jones,
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.880]  on this Friday edition of the show.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.520]  We have another breaking news story talking about terrorism
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.200]  in Europe.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.680]  Helsinki attack, one dead several injured
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.880]  after man drives through crowd.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.440]  That happened probably just a couple of hours ago
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.320]  or an hour ago in Helsinki, Finland.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.120]  One person is dead, several are injured
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.880]  after a man drove through a crowd in Helsinki on Friday.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.480]  They're reporting that the driver was arrested
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.120]  and that he was drunk.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.280]  So we don't know whether this is an accident yet,
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:07.480]  whether it's an actual terror attack or what, but again.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.200]  Bloodshed on the streets of Europe as we saw earlier
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.960]  with Hamburg with a machete knife attack
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.200]  with a guy chanting Alarakbar police say
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.480]  they still don't know the motive.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.880]  It seems that lull that period of calm after Ramadan ended,
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.040]  because of course we know that Islam has nothing
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.880]  to do with terrorism, right?
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.920]  There was a lull in attacks in Europe at least.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.040]  It seems that that has now ended.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.520]  This Helsinki situation remains fluid.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.800]  There's not much information about it.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.600]  I'll try and get more information,
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.760]  but we also had the attack in Hamburg earlier.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.720]  So we will continue to track that.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.440]  Now, the top of the show, I was talking about the pastor,
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.680]  Ronny Howard Brown, who came out publicly
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.560]  and said that he was told of a plot
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.840]  to physically take out President Donald Trump
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.400]  that was brewing on Capitol Hill, a deep state coup
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.640]  to basically assassinate the president,
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.680]  which we've been warning about for months and months.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.240]  We also have the left and the dominant culture
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.920]  normalizing that in the minds of the public,
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.680]  that it's not only likely that there will be
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.000]  an assassination attempt against Donald Trump,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.240]  but that it's legitimate.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.680]  That's the serious nub of the issue.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.440]  They're not just saying that it's possible,
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.440]  that it's likely.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.000]  They're saying that when it happens,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.800]  it will be legitimate.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.720]  That's the impression they're leaving
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.400]  with all this assassination porn.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.960]  Kathy Griffin holding up the severed head of Donald Trump,
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.280]  you know, the play in New York,
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.480]  whichever way you want to spin it.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.240]  They had the same play about Obama.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.080]  Yes, that's true.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.520]  But given the current climate where the president
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.680]  is obviously depicted as Trump, they're stabbing him to death.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.360]  You have Twitter on a daily basis at any point,
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.320]  awash with assassination threats against Donald Trump.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.640]  You have violent attacks against Donald Trump supporters
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.360]  nationwide, which are ignored by the media.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.240]  That is an actual real hate crime wave.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.640]  And now you have this out of the Guardian.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.240]  To kill the president does fact Trump fiction.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.080]  And yet it's yet another fictional fantasy
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.000]  about President Donald Trump being assassinated.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.840]  And the moral quandary of knowing that assassination
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.040]  is about to happen and doing nothing to prevent it.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.600]  That's the actual script of the book.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.280]  So it's not just like a thriller
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.960]  where the president has an assassination attempt against him.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.760]  It's about the moral dilemma
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.120]  of if this militant feminist character in the book,
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.760]  who is, by the way, an Obama holdover
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.560]  that remains within the administration in this plot,
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.640]  which is exactly the same as real life,
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.480]  whether she should prevent the assassination
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.160]  for the greater good.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.400]  And of course, she doesn't prevent the assassination
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.640]  as far as this review goes.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.400]  I haven't read the book, but that's what it suggests
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.920]  that she allows it to happen,
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.920]  despite knowing it's gonna go ahead.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.240]  The article reads, since the Second World War,
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.280]  numerous professors of ethics or theology
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.560]  have fretted over the question of whether a seer
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.200]  or a time traveler, knowing what Adolf Hitler
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.360]  would go on to do could be justified in killing him
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.200]  as a preventative measure.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.400]  So now in the very first paragraph,
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.280]  they legitimize the assassination of Donald Trump
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.720]  by bringing up that moral quandary,
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.600]  would you go back in time and kill Hitler as a baby
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.640]  to prevent six million Jews dying?
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.120]  Literally in the first paragraph,
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.600]  they descend into Godwin's law.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.240]  They descend into literally Hitler,
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.640]  compare Donald Trump to Hitler.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.880]  Then they give you the plot
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.920]  that it's an assassination attempt,
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.600]  no bomber holdover, a militant feminist.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.880]  Yes, the knowledge that it's gonna happen in advance
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.160]  does absolutely nothing to stop it.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.520]  And it's moral, it's legitimate.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.120]  That is the entire thread.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.480]  That's the narrative they've been spinning.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.600]  All this assassination talk,
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.280]  all this assassination porn,
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.000]  is it coming to a head?
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.480]  We'll get more into that after a break.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.560]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live in fourwalls.com.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.120]  A staunch anti-fetalist, Patrick Kenry
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.920]  was opposed to the Constitution fearing
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.880]  it would become a monster that would take over
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.160]  not only the sovereign states that had created it,
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.600]  but that it would become a tool
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.240]  to destroy individual liberty.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.240]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.400]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.680]  may be increased, nor how you were to become
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.360]  a great and powerful people,
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.760]  but how your liberties can be secured.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.680]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.000]  Patrick Kenry warned us, the liberties of a people
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.200]  never were, nor ever will be secure
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.040]  when the transactions of their rulers
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.840]  may be concealed from them.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.560]  Today, everything the government does at every level
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.160]  is concealed from us.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.240]  We have trade deals to manage our economy
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.040]  that not even our elected representatives
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.040]  are allowed to see.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.320]  Later in life, Patrick Kenry looked back and said,
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.360]  when the American spirit was in its youth,
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.240]  the language of America was different.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.520]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:02.200]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort,
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.360]  when we should be demanding liberty.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.320]  For NFLwars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.600]  As most of you already know,
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.880]  I am a voracious consumer of news and information,
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.280]  and in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.280]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.600]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors,
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.880]  in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today,
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.080]  and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.560]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing,
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.480]  and then processing.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.080]  And so I set out to develop Caveman,
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.600]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.760]  but seven other superfood ingredients
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:44.200]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.200]  at the same time.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.600]  NFLwars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.280]  We're getting results, and we're expanding
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.800]  in the face of the complete media assault
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.200]  and winning because of your support.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.120]  Caveman is finally back at the NFLwars store.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.560]  You can get 25% off the regular price
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.560]  for a limited time only at NFLwarslife.com,
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.160]  or by calling toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.080]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.040]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.880]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.080]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.440]  The same team based right here in America
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.920]  that brought you the AlexaPure groundbreaking water filtration
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.280]  systems have now developed AlexaPure Breeze.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.600]  Whether it's your home or office,
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.480]  you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family,
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.800]  your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.480]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.920]  while themselves doing things that mitigate
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.840]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.000]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.840]  The AlexaPure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.520]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.480]  incredibly clean.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.280]  This is a system I'm personally putting in
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.200]  throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.200]  that didn't do as good a job.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.200]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.600]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.200]  Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:20.640]  The war was lost, the treaty signed,
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.640]  it was not cut,
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.840]  we lost the line, it was not cut.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.800]  We are back on the Alex Jones show and returning.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.480]  We have our guest, Tommy Robinson.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.520]  He is, of course, the author of Enemy of the State.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.960]  He has a new book out, I believe, today,
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.240]  which is rocketing up the charts on Amazon.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.880]  We're gonna get into that later in the interview.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.280]  Tommy, welcome back.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.560]  Do we have, Tommy? I don't have any audio for Tommy.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.920]  We'll try and get Tommy's audio back.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.560]  We don't have it at the moment.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.960]  Let me know when we do.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.280]  Let's go back to the news, though.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.360]  I was covering before the break.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.160]  This was out at the London Guardian.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.840]  To kill the president by Sanborn
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.520]  does fact Trump fiction.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.360]  This is another Trump assassination fantasy.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:11.760]  Remember, we even had Ross Douthat out the New York Times
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.760]  before the election, tweet a movie
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.640]  where, I think, it was a congressional candidate
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.200]  was assassinated to prevent him taking office.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.440]  He tweeted it as a joke.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.120]  How many times have we seen New York Times writers,
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.600]  financial Times writers tweet a joke
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.480]  about Trump's assassination?
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:32.680]  They're building up to this.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.920]  They're now literally writing fantasy novels
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.720]  about him being assassinated.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.360]  And it's absolutely unconscionable
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.960]  given what's going on behind the scenes that we know.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.520]  And we'll get more into that later in the show.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.600]  What we do have Tommy Robinson on the line right now,
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.840]  author of Enemy of the State and author of a new book,
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.240]  which, as I said, is skyrocketing up the charts on Amazon.com today.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.760]  Tommy, welcome back.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.760]  Hello, Paul. Thanks for having me.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.080]  Good to have you back.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:03.160]  Now, before this unfortunate attack in Hamburg, Germany today,
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.920]  which we don't know the full details of,
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.240]  but it seems to be another Islamic terror attack,
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.360]  there was this kind of lull, at least in Europe.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.200]  The terror attacks seemed to stop all of a sudden
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.440]  and at least for a period of three or four weeks.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:21.560]  The terror attacks appeared to stop when Ramadan ended.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.160]  Now, Tommy, surely there's no connection,
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.520]  given we know Islam is a religion of peace
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.840]  and that it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.360]  So why did the terror attacks in Europe
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.120]  suddenly seem to stop when we're talking about terrorism?
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.560]  They stopped when Ramadan ended,
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.480]  given that there's no connection.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.800]  We see this every year.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.120]  We've seen what's called the Ramadan Bomberfem,
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:51.080]  which you see the figures coming through daily and they excel.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:56.360]  We see most attacks as instructed during the holy or unholy
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.960]  or very violent month of Ramadan.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.640]  But you're right, you're right, they have basically come to an end.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.000]  But as I say in that, we have had five attacks in the last,
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.840]  three weeks, we're all stopped in the coming minutes
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.280]  just before they were successful.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.320]  So I don't think it's through one, but you are right,
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.480]  it has, as far as we're looking,
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.880]  it had completely stopped in comparison to during Ramadan,
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.480]  which when we saw a wave of three or three months in the UK.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.760]  Exactly, and as you said, I mean, it happens every year.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.680]  Proving again that connection, obviously,
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.360]  if there's a wave of them during Ramadan,
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.640]  there must be some kind of connection, surely.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.840]  There was a kind of lull that seems to have ended today
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.560]  with what's happening in Hamburg.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.640]  The BBC is barely reporting on it.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.880]  Sky News wasn't even reporting on it last time I checked.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.000]  Another thing that they seem not so keen to be reporting on, Tommy,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.200]  is we had a mob rampage in Liverpool recently,
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.320]  which was as plain a hate crime as you will ever see.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.000]  Numerous people attacked in the street.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.560]  We're all supposed to be really concerned about hate crimes
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.040]  in the aftermath of Brexit
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.360]  and in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.120]  But Tommy, why is the BBC not reporting on this?
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.080]  What is it about this hate crime
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.720]  that seems to have prompted the left
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:15.160]  and so much of the mainstream media to ignore it?
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.400]  And let's have the details as well as this crime.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.920]  The details are young Muslim men,
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.160]  they stopped a Muslim man,
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.440]  they said to him, what religion are you?
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.520]  And he said, Muslim.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.320]  They said, say the Muslim words.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.040]  And he said, there is no prophet but Mohammed.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.080]  He said, they left him, they walked on,
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.400]  they stopped the next man.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.360]  What religion are you?
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.880]  I'm Christian, bang.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.280]  They violently beat him, his girlfriend tried to stop them.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280]  These women just hate crimes
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.960]  where there's a group attacking a man.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.640]  They're attacking men who are with their partners
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:41.920]  with their girlfriends.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:42.760]  One of the victims,
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.400]  this is where we see Stockholm syndrome in Europe.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.120]  One of the victims was a Labour councillor.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.400]  Now that Labour councillor,
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.080]  he put out yesterday saying he's not happy
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.760]  with the way it's been reported.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.280]  Because the headline read,
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.760]  Muslim mob attack non-Muslims for being white.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.560]  Completely accurate headline, completely accurate.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.200]  Completely accurate when you hear the details
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.760]  of what's happened, he wasn't happy with that headline.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.000]  He was the man that's been beating up,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.680]  one of the men that's been beating up.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.080]  But these men went through the streets,
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.840]  attacking him, attacking, attacking.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.160]  And, frankly, the first Muslim man that they stopped
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.320]  hid around the police because in his mind,
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.120]  they were asking him, is he Muslim?
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.840]  Because if he wasn't, they were going to kill him.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.960]  Which is what they went on to do, they went on to attack.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.560]  And the reason why this play
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.040]  is the reason why this plays a part for me is,
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.600]  Liverpool, one percent of that city is Muslim.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.640]  I get told by so many of my friends who live in Liverpool,
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.280]  Muslims could not get away with doing that in our city.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.280]  When they talk about all the things that are happening.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.880]  Well, I found shops that were being used
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.600]  for grooming in Liverpool, in Birkenhead,
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.440]  where they were raping the young girls.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.240]  Now we see these sorts of attacks.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.160]  Now, just imagine, which I'll say to people in Liverpool,
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.080]  Luton has a population that has 30 times more Muslims
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.560]  in percentage in the city than what Liverpool has.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.920]  Look what's already happening.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.200]  Look what's already happening.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.920]  And you're right, this is a hate crime
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.160]  that no one spoke about.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.320]  The only hate crimes we want to hit, we hear about,
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.800]  is a dirty look on a bus,
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.280]  or someone treated something offensive.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.160]  And if that was the case,
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.800]  those sorts of stories go completely viral.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.360]  We all see them go viral whenever they happen.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.240]  This, I think this has only been reported originally
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.440]  in the local newspaper,
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.680]  until people have picked up on it
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.720]  and it's gone out now.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.640]  Well, of course, we had another,
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.480]  what they call a hate crime back a few weeks ago,
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:35.560]  probably about six weeks ago after the Manchester attacks,
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.280]  in Liverpool, where it was a guy on a Facebook video,
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.440]  threatening with words to slice Muslims' ears off
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.160]  with a machete, fair enough, that's a hate crime.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.600]  It was reported by everyone.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.040]  It was reported by the BBC.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.680]  That's words, okay?
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.720]  This was an actual violent assault
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.320]  on several people directed against them
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.400]  because they're non-Muslims, because they're white.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.400]  It's not even in the local BBC news section for Merseyside.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.680]  I mean, it must be a deliberate decision to ignore this.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.120]  If the roles were reversed,
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.040]  if this was a bunch of white people,
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.640]  a bunch of far-right Christians or whoever,
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.920]  rampaging through the streets,
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.960]  asking Muslims if they were Christian,
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.040]  if they said they were Muslims,
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.640]  attacking them viciously,
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.680]  that would be a national outrage,
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.720]  as it is, the BBC hasn't even reported it
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.440]  in their local section,
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.200]  and these guys told me they're going to be in jail.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.880]  They've got sentences for about 42 weeks.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.280]  They're probably going to be out on the streets,
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.720]  again, within months,
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.200]  and no one will even have heard of this
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.200]  because they're not reporting on it.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.400]  Well, they've gone to Jihad University as well.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.160]  So that's where they are now.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.000]  They're in prison.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.400]  They're going to be getting radicalised further,
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.360]  more extreme.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.160]  And actually, I just said, could you imagine?
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.800]  Could anyone imagine the outcry
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.080]  if Muslim families, because this is what it is,
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.760]  families, men and women,
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.960]  were stopped walking home and asked,
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.040]  are you Muslim?
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.360]  And when they said yes,
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.280]  they were all violently beaten.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.400]  Could you imagine?
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.760]  Imagine that it wouldn't just be national outrage.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.600]  It would be international.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.760]  It would be worldwide.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.200]  Everyone would be talking about it.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:12.760]  But again, and if I draw another time,
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.800]  you know, for example,
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.000]  what happened to myself recently at Ascot,
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.360]  where I was followed and I was harassed
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.920]  and then in the end I was attacked
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.000]  and I defended myself.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.120]  That story, if you look through the media,
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.720]  I mean like every single news outlet,
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.160]  even in Ireland, in Wales, in Scotland,
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.400]  from the top down, from the national newspapers
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.800]  to the local newspapers, to the Luton Gazette,
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.080]  to the Luton News, to the Dustable, to Gazette,
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.160]  to the Merseyside Gazette,
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.960]  every single newspaper,
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.200]  run that headline with that 17 clips of footage
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.560]  which has just shown me in a naked portrayal.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.600]  Yet go online, find any of the footage of Muslims
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.360]  instantly attacking me in unprovoked attacks.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.600]  They're never shown anywhere.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.320]  So again, we know ourselves and your viewers know as well.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.880]  There is a complete agenda.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.640]  There's a complete agenda to hide the truth, to lie,
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.000]  and that's what we're seeing.
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.800]  And going back to what you talked about
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.080]  with the Stockholm Syndrome,
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.320]  the Labour council was viciously attacked
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.600]  while he was with his girlfriend.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.240]  As he said, he came out later,
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.800]  decried the headline that accurately reported
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.960]  what happened.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.960]  It reminds me of when a woman on a train,
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.840]  I think it was in Austria or Germany,
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.000]  back about a year ago, she was raped by migrants.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.240]  She refused initially to even report it to the police
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.480]  because she said,
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.080]  oh, they've had a difficult time getting here.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.280]  Therefore, maybe me being raped was just,
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.640]  part of their therapy.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.480]  Maybe it's racist to report someone for raping you
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.080]  if they've got brown skin.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.840]  That is the level of Stockholm Syndrome
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.040]  that we've got to right now.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.600]  But I want to go on to talk about another story, Tommy,
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.360]  which came out yesterday, and this is in Birmingham.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:57.760]  Sky News reports, teenage rape victim raped again.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.760]  Rape again by driver, she flagged down.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.720]  So she was raped initially.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.880]  She flagged a driver down for help.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.440]  And she was raped again for a second time.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.320]  Both are described as Asian men in their early 20s.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.560]  Tommy, should we be on the lookout for Japanese people,
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.400]  Chinese people, South Koreans?
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.080]  I mean, what on earth does Asian mean?
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.440]  Why do they keep using that politically correct term?
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.000]  Especially your viewers in America
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.920]  will be so confused by this.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.480]  They would be so confused.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.040]  Anyone from outside the UK, obviously,
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.480]  we've grown up knowing Asian they refer to
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.360]  as Pakistanis, Bangladeshis.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.960]  That's what they're referring to.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.640]  But for anyone else thinking,
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.680]  you wouldn't realise that, you wouldn't know that.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.680]  And that's, again, that's done on purpose.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.040]  That's done to demonise and broaden
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.200]  who it could be.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.560]  We know who it is.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.480]  I could put my life, I could put my house on the fact
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.480]  that both those men are Muslim men.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.640]  Both of them, if they were described accurately,
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.040]  would be described as Pakistani Muslims.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.000]  Accurately.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:57.840]  Not Asian.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.000]  And they're still on the loose, Tommy,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.320]  that not describing them accurately
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.440]  is helping them escape arrest
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.320]  after they raped this poor 15-year-old girl.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.040]  Anytime you read in the media four attackers
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.720]  and they don't give a description,
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.040]  that means, I know what that means,
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.400]  as I'm reading any story,
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.120]  half the time they don't even give descriptions.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.160]  Someone's been beating up or someone's been robbed
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.120]  and the four men run away.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.640]  Okay, what do they look like?
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.640]  Why do you not tell us what they look like?
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:26.080]  If they were white, you'd tell us what they look like.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.800]  Why are you not giving us descriptions of who they were?
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.880]  And that's exactly the same in this situation.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.040]  This is Birmingham.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.520]  And so people, when you read your story that,
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.640]  I was talking about yesterday,
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.360]  someone would think that, where did that happen?
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.360]  In fact, that's, no, that happened in Birmingham.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.880]  A young child was raped.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.240]  It's like, it's like...
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.600]  Something serious?
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.440]  Absolutely amazing, Tommy.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.880]  We'll get back into it after the break.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.560]  Yeah, she was raped twice within the space of what?
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.400]  30 minutes.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.480]  That's flagging someone down for help.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.560]  She was raped by him as well.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.840]  That's the situation we've got in the United Kingdom.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.080]  They're all being protected
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.480]  through political correctness as happened with brother
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.920]  and we'll be back with Tommy Robinson.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.040]  Don't go away.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.680]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists,
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:09.680]  get back to nature.

[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.760]  the excitement and tradition of sling bow.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.280]  A new frontier in archery

[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.280]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.960]  You need survivalist camps.

[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.840]  Today I'm excited to announce
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.640]  the new limited shipment of DNA forces
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.280]  finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.760]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list

[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:17.320]  to receive out of stock products like DNA force.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.320]  And we are now once again expected to sell out
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.160]  very, very soon.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.440]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game changer
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.200]  like DNA force, we never know
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.760]  when we will be able to secure
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.760]  an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.720]  The secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:34.160]  of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.280]  NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ and many others.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.000]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented

[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.520]  And just one batch of this stuff

[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:22.120]  We're live. It is. The Alex Jones show. We're here with Tommy Robinson,
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:33.160]  author of Enemy of the State, but he also has a new book out,
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.600]  which I think came out today.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.600]  It's already skyrocketing of the charts on Amazon.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.760]  Tommy, tell us about that new book,
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.920]  because it's basically an explainer on the Quran,
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.880]  as far as I can tell.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:45.400]  Obviously, I haven't got my hands on it yet.
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.240]  But what's the new book about?
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.080]  What motivated you to write it?
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.960]  Tommy Robinson What the book is, the book is,
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.360]  it is the Quran in the chronological order.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.320]  That's the chronological order that I'm giving.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.320]  Islamic scholars have given.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.280]  So when you put it into chronological order,
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.640]  so it's like two books.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.240]  It's a 10,000-word introduction,
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.120]  which explains to us the great lie,
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.600]  how we've all been lied to.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.200]  What you realize is, and what people feel so betrayed about,
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:12.640]  is that up until September 11th, the elites,
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.120]  that they told the truth for our history about Islam.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.360]  If I quote you now, which I do in this book,
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.120]  if I quote you, Winston Churchill,
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.080]  the Mohammedan religion increases the fury of intolerance,
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.600]  propagated by the sword,
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.720]  the hopes of plunder and the joy of fighting.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.120]  The religion of blood and war is face-to-face with that peace.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:32.760]  Luckily, the religion of peace is usually the better arms.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.160]  Now, in this case, amazingly,
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.000]  the religion of peace means Christianity.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.040]  It's not the lie that we've now been given.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.280]  That was by Winston Churchill.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.920]  So he's a previous world leader.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.840]  If I give you another statement now
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.360]  from an American prime minister,
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:48.480]  who said, the preset of the Quran is perpetual war
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:52.160]  against all who deny that Mohammed is the prophet of God.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.880]  The command to propagate the Muslim creed by the sword
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.560]  is always obligatory.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.160]  When it can be made affected,
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.600]  the commands of the prophet may be performed alike
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.680]  by fraud or by force.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.120]  That was John Quincy Adams,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.360]  sixth prime minister of the United States of America.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.600]  And what we do in this is we bring you through
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.440]  in the introduction and we tell you how we've been lied to
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.040]  and when the lie started and everyone who's told the lie.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.200]  We refer to it as the great lie.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.400]  Now, when you get to the Quran due to abrogation,
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.880]  anyone who doesn't know about the ordinary Quran,
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.480]  when you pick up a Quran and you try to make sense of it,
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.720]  it's not in any chronological order.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.560]  What Mohammed said one day could be next to what he said 20 years,
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.720]  which is what enables Muslims to give
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.880]  that out of context argument all the time.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.080]  And this lie that Islam has written a piece.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.480]  What this does, it puts into chronological order.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:44.920]  And because of abrogation, what Mohammed said later in his life
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.080]  is superseded, earlier in his life,
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.720]  is superseded by what he says later in his life.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.080]  What this does is now when you open the Quran,
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.080]  it's the first one everywhere, we've done it back to front.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.840]  So when you open the start of the Quran here,
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.400]  the first thing you will read is the last thing Mohammed said.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.120]  And it will be very clear to you,
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.360]  we've done it in bold writing.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.760]  So as you get to all the words of violence and war,
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.400]  then in bold writing in the chronological Quran.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.560]  Now, when you get to the peaceful verses,
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.160]  because anyone who knows Mohammed,
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.880]  in his first 10 years of his life, he was quite peaceful.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.960]  All the war, all the rape, all the jihad was introduced later.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.440]  So when you get to the peaceful verses,
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.160]  which now we're at the back of the Quran,
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.440]  it's actually their Quran word for word,
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.960]  but the words are at the back.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.760]  They'll have a little line through them
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.280]  when you get to the peaceful ones,
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.880]  and they'll just have afterwards canceled by verse 2160.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.960]  So they'll tell you which verses
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.840]  cancel them out due to abrogations.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.080]  You'll then go to the verse to read what canceled out,
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.320]  and you'll fully understand why
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.280]  when you read all the rape and the war.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.520]  The idea is that non-Muslims like us,
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.880]  which is our biggest job,
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.720]  is getting people to understand this lie
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:50.760]  that we've been told.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.640]  And when you see it and understand that
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.400]  throughout the whole of our history,
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.080]  our world leaders, our academics, our clergy,
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.800]  they all told the truth.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:02.360]  They all told the truth about Islam.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.200]  This new era, this lie that we've been perpetrating now
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.760]  that's pushed upon us,
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.840]  has all really come around from George Bush
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.600]  after September 11th telling us Islam is religion of peace.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.400]  And what we then do is we quote,
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.080]  leader after leader after leader.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.480]  And when you actually pick this up
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.840]  and by the end of reading it, I'd say to people,
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.720]  I can see them banning this.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.560]  I can see them banning it.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.480]  I can see them already starting a campaign.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.360]  It's number three currently on the UK Amazon chart.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.960]  I am desperate to have Toby Robinson
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.720]  have the best selling Quran in British history.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.720]  So the biggest thing and the joy I get,
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.960]  and even people say you're going to get fat while for that,
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.040]  they're going to kill you.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.880]  You see if I'm killed for writing this book,
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.560]  the whole country is going to read this book.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.200]  When the whole country read this book,
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.720]  the whole country and across the world,
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:48.080]  they will understand what we're up against.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:50.840]  They'll understand just how much we're being betrayed
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.680]  and the deception we've been put through
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.920]  to be fed the lies against Islam.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:55.960]  And yeah, that's it.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.920]  I'm excited about it.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.440]  I'm excited every cell goes through
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.480]  because I know it's another person
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.920]  whose eyes are going to be opened
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.840]  and they will be armed with the defense.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.120]  If people are saying to Islam's religion of peace,
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.360]  read that, okay?
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.320]  That puts it all in order.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.280]  So yeah, I'm happy.
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.120]  I'm happy about it.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.080]  And it's the basic Medina Mecca split, isn't it?
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.320]  Most people don't understand this.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.440]  Most basic bitches basically,
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.720]  they see the memes,
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.360]  they see the inspirational quotes
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.920]  about, oh, if you kill one person, you kill the world.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.520]  Yes, it's completely self-contradictory.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.080]  As you said, later on,
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.320]  that's directly contradicted
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.080]  by all the kill all the infidels passages.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.840]  That kind of stuff comes later on.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.800]  That supersedes it, as you said.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.560]  Most people will never even see that stuff
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.960]  because they're completely brainwashed and indoctrinated.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.200]  Let's get Tommy's book to the top
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:46.240]  of the Amazon bestseller charts.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.000]  Imagine how many people that will trigger.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.840]  That will be absolutely glorious.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:52.200]  We'll be back after the break with Tommy Robinson
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.680]  in fourwars.com.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:55.160]  Don't go away.
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.520]  We're on the march.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.000]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.280]  We hold these truths to be self-evident
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.160]  that all men are created equal,
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.960]  that they are endowed by their creator
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.840]  with certain unalienable rights,
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.760]  that among these are life, liberty,
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.280]  and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.200]  That to secure these rights, governments
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.640]  are instituted among men,
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:25.320]  deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.000]  That whenever any form of government
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.640]  becomes destructive of these ends,
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:31.320]  it is the right of the people to alter
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.640]  or to abolish it and to institute new government.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.880]  Independence isn't a day.
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.960]  It's a mindset, an attitude that says,
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.680]  I will not be your dependent.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.320]  I will not be your slave.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.240]  Dependence and slavery is a chain
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.400]  that is forged link by link
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.400]  with gradual infringements.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.480]  When you trade your liberty for safety,
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.320]  to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.240]  Slaves are never safe.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:59.240]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.280]  Guard your liberty,
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.720]  regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.760]  Renfowars.com, I'm David Dike.

[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.840]  outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.

[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:12.360]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.160]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.440]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.160]  and prepare a defense.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.160]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.640]  were approaching filled with bombs,
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.760]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.600]  But in the 21st century,
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.120]  there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.600]  Pathogens added to the food and water,
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.760]  into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.240]  turn off our hormones,
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.920]  and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:46.360]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:51.360]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.360]  to create the basic foundation
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:57.560]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.400]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:03.520]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.040]  and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:12.040]  Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:19.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:23.680]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.680]  I am the sun.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.640]  We're back with Tommy Robinson,
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:34.120]  bit of breaking news, sad news, but widely expected.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.600]  British media are reporting
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.960]  that 11 months Charlie God,
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.960]  focus of a legal health battle has died.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.840]  The NHS and the EU death panels have claimed another victim.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:47.920]  They wouldn't even let the parents take their baby home to die.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.560]  That was their final wish.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.520]  They couldn't even relent to let them have that.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.200]  Now, Charlie God has officially died.
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.280]  Of course, I was involved in a similar situation
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.120]  a few years ago with some Romanian immigrant parents,
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.200]  hardworking, spoke good English.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.800]  They had a baby in a similar situation, different illness.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.680]  It was a type of blood cancer.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.200]  They'd raised the funds to take it to a different hospital.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:14.640]  They wouldn't let them take the baby out of the hospital.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:15.480]  In some cases,
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.800]  they wouldn't even let the parents sit alone
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:21.240]  with their own baby without being monitored constantly
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.760]  because they thought they would steal the baby.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.360]  Absolutely horrendous treatment of parents
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.880]  going on in this hospital.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.880]  Most of the cases won't even get press attention.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.840]  Even this, they got global press attention
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.960]  from President Trump, from the Pope.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.120]  They still won out in the end.
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.880]  The death panel won.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.720]  Charlie God is dead.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.760]  Absolutely tragic story.
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.400]  Relentlessly shocking story
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.400]  comes to an end on this Friday night.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:51.200]  Going back to Tommy Robinson though, Tommy,
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.800]  you tweeted the image of the perpetrator
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.920]  or one of the perpetrators
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.240]  in the rape of a teenage girl in Birmingham.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:00.080]  Doesn't look very Japanese or South Korean to me.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.480]  What do you think, Tommy?
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.680]  Doesn't look like Bruce Lee, does it?
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.720]  But again, they describe them as Asian.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:11.400]  They don't give out any of the identifying features
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.440]  that are going to help people find these individuals.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.320]  Thankfully, we got the picture from CCTV now.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.320]  But again, it goes back to that politically correct Asian tag.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:20.680]  Absolutely insane.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.960]  Tommy, I want to read you a story which came out today
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.760]  which is uponinforwars.com.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.640]  This is out of information and liberation.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:32.200]  Muslim leader, Australian women need us to fertilize them.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.200]  White race will be extinct in 40 years.
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:36.320]  The Muslim president
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.800]  of the Halal certification authority in Australia
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.760]  reacted to news of allegedly falling sperm counts
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:45.880]  in white males with glee, saying the white race,
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:46.720]  this is a quote,
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.000]  the white race will be extinct in 40 years
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.360]  and Australian women need Muslims to fertilize them.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.360]  Tommy, if you celebrated basically the ethnic cleansing
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.480]  of Muslims or Arabs,
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.360]  what do you think the reaction would be from the media?
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:06.000]  Yeah, that's the insanity is
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.800]  this man has the full support of the liberals.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:12.960]  This man and his goals, even his goals,
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.360]  his goal of getting right with white people,
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.520]  it's supported by many, many who are white.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.840]  You couldn't make it up.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.360]  You can, and I actually have friends
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.880]  who have been battling with this man's group
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:26.920]  in Australia, the Halal certification.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.560]  And they're doing now the similar tactics
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:30.080]  where they're launching their solicitors
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.840]  and trying to sue and trying to silence people anyway they can.
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.960]  If they can't do it through fear, through violence,
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.120]  then they'll do it through the legal route,
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.240]  whether it be the police doing it,
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.480]  whether it be Muslim organizations
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.640]  and rich people doing it.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:43.120]  But that sort of statement, again,
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.720]  this is the first I've heard of this.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.920]  I haven't heard of this story today.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:47.280]  I haven't read this story today.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:50.440]  This should be, that should be major, major news
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.440]  in Australia.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.880]  He should be, everyone should be coming down on that man
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:56.960]  for his views and for what he's propagating against us.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.800]  But of course, we know they won't.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.640]  We know they won't.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.600]  And it's just thankful for channels like this
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.000]  and people like us to make people aware of what's happening.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.600]  Let me read a bit more of it, Tommy, guess even worse.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.040]  This is Mr. L. Mooley, who made the comment
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.000]  after Hebrew University in Jerusalem published research
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.680]  which showed sperm counts in men from Australia, New Zealand,
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.360]  North America and Europe had declined by more than 50%
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.400]  in less than 40 years.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.440]  Of course, we know white people
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.560]  basically aren't having children anymore.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.040]  There is a lot of propaganda
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:31.160]  about the decline in population being a catastrophe.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.760]  That's not necessarily the case,
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.400]  but that's the scientific fact
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.560]  that the white population is basically dying out
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.160]  in the Western world right now.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.760]  This is what he went on to say though.
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:43.320]  This is a quote, your men are a dying breed.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:45.480]  Australian women need us to fertilize them
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:48.120]  and keep them surrounded by Muslim babies
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:51.640]  while be a swelling cigarette smoking, drug injecting
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:55.000]  can only dream of what Muslim men are capable of.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.640]  Oh really, what acid attacks, honor killings,
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.640]  is that the enjoyment they've got to look forward to.
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:03.200]  Muslims have a duty to make your women happy.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.440]  He went on to say, Australia's white race
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.520]  will be extinct in another 40 years
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.080]  if the country is left to be it.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.760]  The Muslim businessman called on these bigots
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.560]  to kill themselves or die.
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:18.960]  He actually not only said that white people
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:19.920]  will be ethnically cleansed,
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.800]  he wants white people to kill themselves.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.000]  And as he said, that is what the left has also endorsed.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.080]  You had Stephanie von Berg,
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.320]  head of the Green Party in Germany,
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.400]  right at the time they were importing millions
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.240]  of Muslim migrants.
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.760]  Get up in front of parliament,
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.800]  say Germans will be a minority in their own cities
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:41.840]  within 20 years and that's a good thing.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.440]  She celebrated it.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.800]  Now this Muslim president
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.160]  of the Halal certification authority agrees with her
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.200]  and that is the alliance speaking the same rhetoric
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.120]  right there, Tommy.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.280]  He'll be a well-respected Muslim,
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.200]  a representative of their community.
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.200]  He won't be a fringe voice.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.160]  He'll be a well-respected Muslim in their community,
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.720]  saying all of these things.
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:04.960]  Saying all of these things.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.640]  And you're right, you see,
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.800]  I saw the previous one you were talking about.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.440]  I saw them all cheering.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.640]  Yes, and we'll get rid of white people.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.080]  And no Germans will be left.
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.560]  And then I was like, yes.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.360]  It's already in Frankfurt,
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.480]  it's already Germans are already a minority in Frankfurt.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.880]  You know, white English people
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.720]  are already a minority in London.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:28.200]  Any other city in the world,
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.480]  imagine if ethnic Chinese people
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.920]  were a minority in Beijing.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.840]  Imagine if ethnic Japanese people
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:37.120]  were a minority in Tokyo.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.920]  That would not be normal,
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:40.520]  but it's only in the West
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:43.040]  that we're told that that's completely normal.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:44.720]  To the point now, Tommy,
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:47.960]  where the BBC had an educational cartoon
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.720]  about a typical family.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.000]  Now this was their word,
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  a typical family in Roman Britain 1500 years ago,
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.080]  and they depicted this family as black.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.360]  Now, if that was true, fair enough,
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.960]  but it's not, it's total revisionism.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.960]  A tiny, tiny amount of people in Roman Britain were black.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.560]  That is not a typical representation.
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.840]  The reason they're doing that,
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:15.560]  the reason they're depicting mixed race communities
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:18.880]  in ancient times, again, completely historically inaccurate,
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.920]  is to pretend, is to indoctrinate young people
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:24.080]  that mass uncontrolled immigration
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.800]  has always been a natural thing throughout history.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:28.640]  It hasn't.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:31.760]  If you look at the numbers of immigrants coming into Britain,
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:34.240]  it was very, very slow,
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.000]  right up until the latter half of the 20th century.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.800]  This historical revisionism,
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.520]  to make everyone think that this is natural and normal,
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.800]  that it's normal for white English people to be a minority
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:48.640]  in their own capital city,
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.000]  is one of the most insidious things I've seen
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.280]  in recent times, Tommy.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.000]  How quickly have they accelerated it?
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.600]  You know, you talk about white English people
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.040]  being a minority in their capital cities.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.840]  In my hometown, I've been brought up
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:03.160]  in white English people are a minority.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.840]  Now, what you have to look at to understand
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.000]  what's happening and how fast it is happening
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.440]  is the government projected growth forecast by 2030,
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.880]  which is what now, 30 years away.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:16.360]  The Pakistani Bangladesh community of Luton
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:19.760]  will increase by 70 to 77%.
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:22.600]  The white community will stay the same by 1.3%.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:25.840]  Now, when you look at how many people there are now,
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:29.680]  and it shows the decline that's going to happen,
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.680]  it's literally gonna be no white people left in 15 years.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:34.400]  In my town of Luton.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.120]  Now, how quickly that has happened,
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.240]  and the generation I feel sorry for,
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:40.200]  and the generation that are born into this,
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.680]  because you're right, they want them to believe
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.120]  this is normal, because to many of them,
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.520]  that's all they've known.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.720]  Now, I can remember Luton.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.760]  I can remember just 20 years of,
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.480]  I can remember how bad it's got,
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:52.600]  but any people, any children born 10 years ago,
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.560]  five years ago even, this is all they know.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.800]  This is all they're gonna have seen.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:59.080]  They're only gonna experience seeing majority Muslim
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.520]  towns and cities, and that this is the norm,
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.800]  and that this is the way it is,
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.720]  and you don't have all those freedoms,
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:05.920]  you don't have all that enjoyment,
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.080]  but that is life.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.080]  And that's true to the acceleration
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.640]  of how quickly it's happened,
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.600]  and how it's being celebrated,
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.680]  and really getting the British public to wake up,
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:17.240]  or the general European public to wake up,
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:18.600]  so this is happening.
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:20.680]  And if you don't think that this conflict can happen,
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.200]  because we're Britain, and we're better than that,
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.600]  it's the same Islam.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:27.600]  It's the same Islam that sport 45 countries
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.720]  to civil conflict.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:30.640]  It's the same if you look even 20 years ago,
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.600]  if you look at Serbia, just 20 years ago,
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.040]  there was a war zone, there was a war.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.800]  And I just think people are so naive to thinking
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:41.520]  that can't happen here, that will happen here.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.000]  And even a quote in a video I've done earlier,
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.240]  the previous French prime minister,
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.560]  just recently said civil war is coming to Europe.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:51.280]  Civil war is coming, and we must brace ourselves for it.
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.040]  And when you say things that, people are so shocked by it,
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.080]  they shouldn't be.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.040]  This era of peace that we have,
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.120]  this generation of peace that we have, it's unheard of.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:02.000]  And why would it be any different for the next generation
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.600]  when we have imported a completely intolerant
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.160]  and violent extreme ideology into our country,
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.720]  which is propagating subjugation against us,
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.240]  intolerance against us, war against us?
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.600]  I'm terrified for what the future brings.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:17.200]  And the demographic will change.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.840]  I mean, talk about those figures.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:23.080]  It wouldn't be that alarming if it wasn't at the hands
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:27.360]  of an intolerant ideology, that were the excelling numbers.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.720]  They're the only numbers that excelling.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:32.320]  The black non-Muslim community are not excelling in numbers.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.960]  The Chinese community aren't.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.000]  The Hindu community aren't.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.360]  The Sikh community aren't.
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.680]  No one else is.
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:39.400]  This complete explosion in growth,
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.040]  which people have to ask, why is it,
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.200]  why is it on average Muslims have eight babies
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.560]  on average in France,
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.960]  over five and a half on average in the UK?
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:49.320]  This is happening across the whole of Europe.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.360]  And we should be afraid.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.560]  And if it was a compatible culture,
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:57.960]  if it was Sikhs that were exploding in birth rate,
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.120]  it wouldn't be a problem,
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.640]  but it's the fact that this is not compatible.
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:04.040]  Again, we should be terrified of what's coming.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.840]  But being terrified of what's coming, Tommy,
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:08.960]  doesn't mean, and I get this,
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:10.280]  you probably get this as well,
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.600]  that we're frightened of Muslims.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.600]  This is one of the few things that the left
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.120]  tries to throw at me, particularly,
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:18.560]  because they've got no argument.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.480]  Oh, you're frightened of Muslims.
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:23.880]  So I say, okay, if I was frightened of Muslims,
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:25.560]  I wouldn't criticize Islam.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:26.920]  If I was frightened of Muslims,
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:29.480]  I wouldn't continue to criticize Islam
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:31.560]  after receiving death threats.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.720]  And of course, you receive many more death threats than me.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:36.920]  You receive violent threats on Twitter on a daily basis.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.840]  Tommy, if I was frightened of Muslims,
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:41.400]  I wouldn't live in South London
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:42.960]  where there are lots of Muslims.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:45.480]  I'd live somewhere like the Cotswolds,
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.800]  where it's 98% white.
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:49.800]  If I was frightened of Muslims,
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:53.760]  I'd pander to Muslims and I'd make apologies for Islam.
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.640]  Tommy, if I was frightened of Muslims,
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.280]  I'd behave like the left.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:00.640]  So they're the ones who are frightened of Muslims.
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:03.520]  Technically, they're the Islamophobes
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.840]  because they're frightened of Muslims they've submitted.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.560]  Okay, you're saying every time,
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.440]  does it look like we're frightened?
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:13.760]  Does it look like we're frightened?
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.840]  You're literally out on the street like every other week
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.760]  getting into physical confrontations with Muslims
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.560]  who come up to you.
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:22.760]  But no, we're frightened of Muslims, okay.
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.000]  See, that's just the poor city of arguments
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.400]  they have left, that's what they resort to.
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.080]  Absolutely insane.
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.560]  I wanna bring up something else though,
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.400]  we touched on it earlier.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.720]  The left aligning with Islam,
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.640]  the progressive tolerant left
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:39.400]  aligning with the most regressive belief system
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.920]  the world has ever seen.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:42.840]  You've got this guy on Twitter.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:45.280]  I mean, he's probably blocked you years ago by now.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.120]  He did me.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.280]  Graham Linnehan, who is a comedy writer,
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.120]  a massive verified liberal on Twitter
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:57.120]  who recently tweeted that the official leave.eu Twitter account
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.720]  should be, in his own words, reported for hate speech.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:03.360]  Their crime, that he said they should be reported
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.360]  for hate speech for, was to call the terrorist
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:10.240]  who beheaded Lee Rigby, quote, murdering scum.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:13.960]  So they committed the crime of insulting a terrorist
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:17.720]  who beheaded a British soldier on the streets of London.
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:22.000]  And this leftist rushed to the defense of the terrorist.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.120]  Absolutely incredible, Tommy.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:26.080]  And it brings it back to, you know,
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.560]  after every single terror attack in the UK,
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.800]  when the left get together with their vigils
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:33.880]  and their hashtags, they say unite.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:36.880]  They're not talking about uniting against terrorism, Tommy.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:39.480]  They're talking about uniting against us.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.720]  Uniting against the people
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.040]  who most vehemently denounce terrorism
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:45.560]  and dare to identify its root cause.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:48.840]  They really have aligned in some cases
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:52.200]  with actual terrorists, if not Islamism, Tommy.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.440]  When they talk about hatred,
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.040]  they'll say to you or they'll say to me,
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.720]  you do this out of hate.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.560]  Do you really think we could carry on?
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.280]  Does anyone have that much hate
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:03.520]  that they can continue to go through this?
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:07.280]  Continue to take the risk, continue to do it out of hate?
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.720]  It's just, it's insanity.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.960]  I said, well, when people say you're scared of Muslims,
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:14.440]  I think, look, I'm scared as a father,
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:16.320]  with three beautiful young children.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.040]  I'm scared watching the video of what happened in Manchester.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.880]  I'm scared knowing that there's thousands
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.520]  upon thousands of those men
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:25.040]  who want to do those actions to us here,
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.320]  walking on streets every day.
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.400]  That's what I'm scared.
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.000]  And when they say you do it out of hate,
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.360]  I say, I do it out of love.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.600]  I love my kids.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.760]  I love my country.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:34.960]  I love my town.
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:36.000]  I love it.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.480]  And it is painful and gut-wrenching
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:41.600]  to see what you are letting happen to it.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.840]  And these liberals like the people you're talking to
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.160]  who jump to their defense every time,
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.600]  it's you who are responsible for the troubles we face.
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.240]  And you know where this does go, Pete Tong?
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.760]  Well, it does go bad.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.840]  So who they're going to be running to?
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.440]  They're going to be running to us,
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:59.760]  running to the people they've criticized,
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:01.360]  running for the protection of them,
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:02.680]  running for the health of them,
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:04.440]  running, looking for leadership.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.720]  Because when it goes to an almighty bank,
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:10.840]  all these people, and I hope everyone remembers who they are.
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:14.160]  And again, that's why I wrote that to list the people.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.040]  This is who you are and that you'll be remembered in history.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.440]  This era that we've entered,
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:21.240]  which is an era where we've bred a generation
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:24.080]  of pure cowards, pure cowards.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:27.200]  If you look, I know the Dunkirk films out now,
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.800]  if you look and understand in history
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:32.440]  what previous British men done,
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.880]  what they went through and what they sacrificed
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.480]  to give a fighting chance, to give a future.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:40.440]  And then you look at these muckets that we've got now.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:43.280]  You look at this absolute joke of a generation
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.400]  that I'm ashamed to be a part of.
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:48.800]  I'm ashamed that I'm balling this era of complete cowards,
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.880]  where we have British men have become such a laughing stock.
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:53.640]  You only have to look to Europe.
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:56.800]  I met two Polish gentlemen yesterday for an interview.
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:58.040]  And I look to their countries,
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:02.080]  I see an envy at their man, at the men they have.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:03.560]  I see an envy looking at Russia.
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.200]  I see an envy looking at Hungary.
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:06.760]  I see an envy looking at Poland.
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:08.080]  I look at Czech Republic.
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.080]  And I see real men.
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.400]  I see real men and I see the destruction
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:15.600]  that's been caused and the way they've targeted us.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.040]  And they've bred out.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.320]  They've bred out and they fight in the men in England.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:23.680]  And we now sit back and we scratch our heads
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.880]  and we wait to watch the next attack
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.600]  where our military are beheaded
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.640]  or our children are blown to pieces.
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.400]  And the whole time while we do that,
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:35.000]  these liberals and these elites who are in control of the media,
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.760]  who are in all their positions of power,
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:38.640]  they scream down at us.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.320]  They scream and condemn us.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.040]  It's absolutely insane that I just sort of pull my hair out
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.840]  daily with it as anyone can imagine.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:48.000]  Everyone sees, but I get so frustrated.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  So frustrated and again, unfortunately, Paul,
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.280]  we're in this era in history, everyone will look.
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:58.520]  Whether it be eight years ago and people viewed me as extremist,
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:01.480]  when I see people saying the same things against yourself,
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:03.760]  saying things against any people on our side,
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:05.040]  as the years go on,
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:09.680]  as the years go on, people will look back,
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:11.120]  they will learn and listen.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:12.720]  And when things go wrong,
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.520]  they will look to the people who they can trust.
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:16.240]  And they will trust the people that told them truth
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:17.600]  in the time of hardship.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:20.040]  The people who stood against everything else
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.520]  and said, this is what's happening.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:22.520]  This is Islam.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:23.680]  This is who's doing it.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:25.160]  This is who's facilitating it.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.000]  And they'll look to us.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.880]  So I sit comfortably in that.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.360]  And I know yourself as well.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:34.520]  And yeah, I sit comfortably that more people than ever are awake.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.880]  More people are waking up.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:41.440]  But what it will take to really give Englishmen back their fight.
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:44.040]  And when that line awakes, I just...
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.440]  I'm crying for the day.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.600]  I'm crying for the day.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.880]  Absolutely amazing, Tommy.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.480]  I mean, yeah, every time I look in the mirror,
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:53.040]  I know for a fact I'm standing on the right side of history.
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.800]  OK, you can't level that charge against me.
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:58.000]  We do this with vehement passion.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.360]  And it's born solely out of love.

[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:06.280]  Going back to Tommy Robinson.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:09.680]  Tommy, you've got an event coming up tomorrow in Sunderland,
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:13.240]  up in the north of England, an update on the shopkeeper
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:17.280]  who was harassed by police for the don't fund terrorism
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:19.760]  sign that he put up outside his shop.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:22.280]  What's happening in Sunderland tomorrow?
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:25.920]  Yeah, so we've got a website, savefletcher.com,
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:28.440]  and what happened was a young man put a sign up
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:29.760]  saying don't fund terrorism.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:31.920]  The police then harassed him and persecuted him.
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.280]  Visited his shop five days in one week.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:37.360]  Now, we will now hardly get police officers.
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.560]  This comes from the councils.
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.880]  The council's campaign was to stop him as well.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:42.080]  They got involved.
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:43.400]  They then threatened his mum.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:45.400]  His mum was then threatened with taking away their alcohol
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.320]  license.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:49.480]  He then, because he was concerned for his livelihood,
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:51.000]  he took the sign down.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.480]  We were here with rebel media that then went away
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:56.120]  and got him a lawyer, got him a solicitor, sat him down.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.880]  The solicitor told them they can't do this,
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:00.280]  and he'll defend him if they come back to do it.
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.000]  We put the sign back up and put up a bigger and better sign,
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.240]  a big illuminating sign, don't fund terrorism, shop at Fletcher's.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.440]  Because of their attempt to silence him,
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:11.280]  their attempt to put pressure on his shop,
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.640]  tomorrow I'm spending the day working in his shop.
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:15.400]  And we've got lots of people coming to visit us.
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:16.680]  We're sending bumper stickers.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:18.840]  The bumper stickers will read, don't fund terrorism,
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:20.040]  shop at Fletcher's.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:23.000]  And we're hoping now that cars across the whole of Sunderland
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.760]  and across everywhere will be showing these signs.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:27.240]  And the reason he had a sign to say,
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.160]  don't fund terrorism, shop at Fletcher's.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.600]  A Muslim businessman just 2.3 miles away from his shop
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.880]  was funding ISIS.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:37.600]  Up to 8 million pounds, I believe, they were in the court case.
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:40.160]  So the police, you can't even have a sign
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:41.400]  saying, don't fund terrorism.
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:43.840]  We've got a police coming to stamp down and enforce
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:46.920]  their fear among the intactics upon you.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.160]  So yeah, the lad owns his shop,
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.960]  so I think a lot of courage.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.200]  He's put his reputation on the line,
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:56.240]  his business on the line, in the face of persecution.
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.480]  And because of that, I just wanted to support him.
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:01.400]  So I'm going there tomorrow with others from Rebel.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:02.880]  We're doing this little campaign.
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:05.000]  We'll be working at his shop.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.120]  Yeah, it's a happy story.
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:06.960]  It's a good story.
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:12.200]  So the only problem is that Celtic seems to be playing
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.480]  the same scene.
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:17.160]  And for some reason, Celtic fans think that I deserve death
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.440]  just as much as many people think I deserve death.
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.200]  And I want to get into that after the break.
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:24.360]  We've got a minute and then we'll go to the next segment.
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:26.760]  But again, Wilshire Police put out this tweet saying,
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:28.280]  they're going to hunt down people who
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.520]  say mean things on Twitter.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.400]  We've got record police shortages.
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:33.920]  We've got them literally begging retired police officers
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:34.680]  to come back.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:35.960]  They're totally stretched.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:38.600]  Oh, well, they've got time to investigate a guy with a sign
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:41.040]  outside his shop saying, don't fund terrorism.
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:42.280]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.840]  We'll be back with Tommy Robinson.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:44.520]  Don't go away.
[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:50.840]  And thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.400]  Prostigard.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:04.400]  It's time to start assisting the body
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.840]  in regulating proper prostate balance.

[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:19.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:24.080]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover us.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:25.800]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:27.400]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:32.400]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:36.400]  I walk along the avenue.
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:38.400]  I never thought I'd be able to find my way.
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.880]  Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:43.120]  We're here with Tommy Robinson for the final segment.
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.000]  We were talking before the break about the guy who
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.760]  was harassed up in Sunderland, which
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:48.360]  is a town in northern England.
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:50.880]  We're putting up a sign above his shop saying,
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.680]  don't fund terrorism.
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:55.640]  God forbid anyone should express that sentiment.
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.920]  As Tommy said, a shop two miles down the road
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:00.480]  was literally in bed with ISIS.
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:01.560]  They didn't get harassed.
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:02.960]  They didn't get abused.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:04.680]  We've also got police all over Twitter.
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:06.720]  And we had another case of this recently.
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:09.240]  Police departments in England, in Britain,
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:11.880]  threatening people with home visits, literally
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:15.720]  threatening to track down, to hunt down people who send
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:17.160]  mean tweets.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:19.400]  They've got time for that all day long,
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:22.520]  despite the fact that police numbers are at record lows
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:22.880]  right now.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.600]  They're begging for police to come out of retirement.
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:28.280]  They've got time to harass people for tweets.
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:30.160]  They've got time to harass people
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:33.000]  for having signs outside their shop,
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.680]  above their shop window.
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:36.120]  And yet we've got acid attacks.
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.600]  We've got stabbings all over the place.
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.400]  We've got violent crime at a 10-year high in this country.
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.480]  Absolutely incredible, Tommy.
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:44.960]  And you're going there to support this guy again.
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:48.480]  Now you're getting harassed by fans of Celtic football club.
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:50.480]  Just tell us again what was happening there.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:54.000]  And then give people the links where they can get the book.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.440]  People don't know what the history was Celtic.
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.760]  So I've got many friends who support Celtic.
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:02.360]  The Celtic football club share a solidarity and an alliance
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.080]  with Palestine.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.040]  They always fly the Palestinian flag.
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:08.880]  They hate many of their supporters, hate Britain.
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:09.680]  They hate the Queen.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.120]  They burn the poppy.
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:13.560]  They support the IRA.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:16.840]  So because I have my stance, and I'm not against Catholics,
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:18.840]  I don't hate the Irish.
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:20.960]  I don't really like Celtic at all.
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:24.600]  So because of that, they're all saying that Celtic are playing
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:26.760]  Sunderland in the same city.
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:29.080]  There's in fact 8,000 Celtic fans.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:32.360]  And apparently, as I hear all the time, they're going to get me.
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.400]  So again, I'm not popping that.
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:36.280]  I will actually go into the Celtic Sunderland game.
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:38.800]  You've never seen that on Twitter before, have you, Tommy,
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:40.680]  where people threaten to physically attack you
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:44.280]  and then do absolutely nothing about it.
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:46.240]  The thing is, when you're talking about, I won't mind you,
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:47.520]  because I'm not bothered by those sorts of tweets.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:48.680]  But what about the police?
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:50.600]  Can the police say they're going to track people down?
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.160]  Some of these messages I've received today,
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:55.360]  they're going to cut me up, find me, chop me up, murder me.
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:56.920]  But they're the crimes that police start...
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:58.520]  They won't even get banned by Twitter.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:01.120]  They even Twitter won't even do anything about it.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:02.120]  No, they won't.
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:03.800]  And I'm not saying the police should bother them with that.
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:06.240]  But the point is, if you're going to track down Englishmen
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.640]  for saying stupid little comments,
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:09.920]  then you need to do it both ways.
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:12.400]  The rule of law has to be implemented equally across all of us.
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:13.560]  Or not all.
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:15.400]  So yeah, it's frustrating to get frustrated by it all.
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:16.800]  But I'll be in Sunderland.
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.720]  Hopefully I don't get too beaten up by any Celtic fans
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:23.480]  with their potatoes, but we'll see.
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.120]  All right, Tommy, we've got about a minute left.
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:27.560]  Just tell people where they can find you on Twitter
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:29.400]  and where they can get the new book.
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:30.240]  You can find on Twitter.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:33.720]  The new book is only, as usual, no publishers have published it.
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:35.760]  It's simply on Amazon.
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:38.240]  So go on Amazon, search Mohammed's Quran,
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:40.480]  why Muslims kill for Islam.
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:42.080]  And yeah, it's on Amazon.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:44.600]  The Kindle will be out on the 31st.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:46.800]  Other than that, our campaign for Fletcher is called
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.240]  savefletcher.com.
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:49.520]  We've got many campaigns running.
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:50.840]  We've got another one called Thang Nox,
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:52.240]  which will be updated soon.
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:54.520]  This is where we're trying to get the lad the wheelchair.
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.400]  We're trying to get him, and you can go on Thang Nox.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:59.200]  He served 40 years in the military.
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:01.760]  And like most other people in this country, he's been abandoned.
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:04.040]  He's been abandoned while some money is spent on, I don't know,
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:05.800]  Somalians or Pakistanis.
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.200]  So this is a campaign where we want to help people.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:09.960]  We're going to be doing one a month through rebel.
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.040]  We're going to be helping them to get them what they need.
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:13.440]  This lad needs a wheelchair.
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:14.760]  We're nearly there.
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:16.640]  We've put a 30% deposit down.
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:19.160]  The wheelchair he needed was £13,000.
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:21.680]  I met the company last week, and the one we're getting
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:24.440]  was £18,000, because we're getting in the top of the range
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.600]  with everything, because that's what he deserves.
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:27.800]  Yeah, so there's loads of campaigns.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:29.360]  You can follow me on Twitter.
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:32.440]  Toby Robinson, New Era, or Team Robinson, New Era,
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:36.000]  or on Facebook, and see what we're actually doing.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.400]  All right, and I'll be sure to support that cause as well.
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.960]  Tommy, great to have you back.
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:41.040]  Hope to have you on again soon.
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.360]  Thanks for joining us today.
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.800]  Thank you very much. Cheers, man.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.520]  Cheers to that.
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.240]  All right, there goes Tommy Robinson.
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.920]  Get his new book.
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:52.640]  Get it to the top of the Amazon UK bestseller list.
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:55.520]  That will annoy the left like nothing else.
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:57.120]  Absolute triggering.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:59.320]  That will be delicious.
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:01.840]  Do observe and enjoy Tommy Robinson.
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:03.720]  You can find him on Twitter at Tommy Robinson.
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:04.400]  Just search for it.
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:07.080]  We will look back on the Alex Jones show live in Four Wars.com.
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:09.160]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights,
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:11.480]  wrote, where an excess of power prevails,
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:14.080]  property of no sort is duly respected.
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:16.840]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person,
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:19.560]  in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:22.160]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:22.960]  in Washington?
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:25.280]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:27.920]  And how do we remove that power from Washington
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.640]  to our local communities to the individual?
[02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:32.480]  That is the ultimate concern.
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:34.880]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:38.720]  was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:41.120]  It was why the anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution.
[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:43.520]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:45.440]  to abuse that concentration of power.
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:47.280]  But as James Madison also pointed out,
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:50.040]  knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:52.040]  The people who mean to be their own governors
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:55.480]  must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:56.920]  Arm yourself with the information
[02:05:56.920 --> 02:05:59.760]  of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:00.840]  upon them are.
[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:02.760]  Only then will you have the courage
[02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:04.600]  to nullify their actions.
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:07.320]  From FourWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:09.680]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:11.840]  and put it together with our own four years
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:15.160]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:16.600]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:17.880]  to detoxify the body.
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:19.920]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:22.760]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:24.200]  It's made in the USA.
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:27.000]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.800]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.040]  and it supports the info war.
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:33.160]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:35.400]  This is the formula that I personally
[02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:36.880]  have been taking for over a year.
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:40.040]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.920]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:44.880]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:47.800]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:50.480]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:52.440]  and as focused as you can be
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:55.360]  because we need you, the remnant of America
[02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:57.720]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:59.720]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:01.960]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:03.000]  we're changing the world.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.600]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:06.840]  with ZShield and in fourwarslife.com.
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:10.040]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:12.440]  three things that will save you a lot of money
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:14.120]  while you get high quality products
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:16.520]  and fund the info war, a 360 win.
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:19.480]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout,

[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:28.080]  that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:31.080]  because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:33.840]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:36.240]  on all orders above $50.
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:38.520]  Listeners have been requesting this for years
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:40.840]  because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:42.400]  the products that you need each month.
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:44.000]  Just go to infowarsore.com,

[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:52.800]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:55.400]  and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:56.840]  this is a sure win.

[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:00.760]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com,
[02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:02.680]  free shipping on orders above 50 bucks
[02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:05.440]  and all out of stock items are never out of stock
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:07.040]  when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:15.520]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:19.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:23.360]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:25.480]  From the land of the ice and snow
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:28.760]  from the midnight sun where the hot spring is blowing.
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:30.200]  Number of the gold.
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:32.800]  Go back live on the Alex Jones show.
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:34.400]  Gonna go to a cliff in a second
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:36.840]  about the illegal alien.
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:39.120]  Rape and Rob the woman in Portland
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:42.040]  had 20 deportations to his name.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:45.400]  They tried to deport him 20 times.
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:46.440]  And then this happened.
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:48.040]  Well, what a surprise.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:49.440]  We're gonna go to that clip in a second.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:51.720]  We have this report out of Fox News.
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:56.080]  House votes for 1.6 billion down payment on board wall.
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:58.640]  The GOP control house has given tentative approval
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:02.320]  to 1.6 billion down payment for President Trump's
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:05.360]  long promise wall along the US-Mexico border.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.280]  The controversial wall money has been given a ride
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:10.520]  on legislation to give the Pentagon a massive spending boost
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:12.880]  and increased funding for veterans medical care.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:14.120]  So we've seen the plans.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:15.960]  We've seen the preparations.
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:19.880]  DHS leaked plans for this border wall.
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:22.640]  Many people still say it's never gonna happen.
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:24.200]  Just like they say Donald Trump
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:25.920]  would never win the presidency.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:27.000]  The plans are in place.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.200]  Now it seems the money is coming down the pipeline.
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:31.960]  And boy is it needed more than ever.
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:34.280]  We have this article from a couple of days ago
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:35.320]  out of the Gateway Pundit.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:38.880]  Illegal alien rapes and Rob's woman in Portland
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:41.280]  had 20 deportations removals.
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:44.080]  Despite being deported several times over the years
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.440]  and found guilty of a plethora of previous crimes,
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:50.440]  Sergio Jose Martinez walked freely in Portland, Oregon
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:52.760]  and went on to get another crime spree.
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:54.760]  He broke into the homes of two women.
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:57.240]  Two women where he raped them,
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:58.680]  robbed them of cash and other items
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:00.040]  and stole one of their cars.
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:04.200]  He previously being deported 20 times
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:06.520]  and we have a video clip on this right now.
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:07.560]  Let's roll the clip.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:12.480]  The word sanctuary calls to mind some place safe
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:15.080]  but too often for families and victims affected
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:17.560]  by illegal immigrant crime.
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:20.280]  Sanctuary cities are anything but safe.
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:21.840]  Instead, these cities are places
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:24.640]  that allow some criminals go free,
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:26.360]  undermine federal law enforcement
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:28.400]  and make our communities less safe.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:41.280]  The
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:43.640]  Portland's next mayor is ready to defy our next president.
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:45.880]  Ted Wheeler says Portland will continue
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:49.240]  to be a sanctuary city for undocumented people.
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:52.320]  There's no place in this community for sexism
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:55.840]  or racism, religious intolerance and xenophobia.
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:58.400]  It's safe and welcome in this community.
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:01.400]  Two violent attacks in one day.
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:04.720]  Both of these incidents appear to be stranger incidents,
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:08.800]  no connection to the victim and incredibly violent.
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:11.760]  Sergio Martinez broke into a Northeast Portland home
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:14.800]  on Monday and raped a 65-year-old woman
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:18.120]  and after that assaulted another woman in a parking garage.
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:20.320]  We found out that 31-year-old Sergio Martinez
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:23.600]  has a long history of being deported to Mexico
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:26.280]  and illegally re-entering the U.S.
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:29.280]  He's been deported 20 times to be exact.
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:31.680]  Martinez is being held on 13 charges
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:35.480]  from kidnapping to sex abuse to assault on these attacks.
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:38.080]  Now, court documents indicate his first victim says
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:41.880]  she was tied up by him before he sexually abused her.
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:44.160]  CoinSix has found he's got a long arrest record
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:46.760]  starting 15 years ago in California.
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:49.400]  He was convicted of burglary, battery, theft
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:51.520]  and illegally entering the U.S. from Mexico
[02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:54.360]  at least 20 times after being deported.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:55.760]  Court records show he's been living
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:57.800]  at Multnomah County for several months
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:59.160]  and says he's a transient.
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:02.240]  County records show he has nine failure to appear warrants
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.000]  going back several years.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.560]  A question is whether these attacks could have been prevented
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.760]  if federal immigration agents were notified
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:11.280]  that Martinez was under arrest in the past.
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:13.120]  The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office tells me
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:16.080]  state law forbids them from using state resources
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:17.800]  for immigration enforcement
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:20.280]  and that's why they would not notify ICE,
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:23.000]  the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.280]  The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:28.280]  The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:30.280]  Absolutely incredible report that.
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:31.280]  Absolutely incredible report that.
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:32.280]  Absolutely incredible report that.
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:33.280]  We will remain open.
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:34.280]  We will remain open.
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:35.280]  Absolutely incredible report as I said
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:38.040]  that is available on the Alex Jones channel.
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:39.280]  That wall is getting built.
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:40.280]  It has to be built.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:42.920]  At least the attempted illegal crossings
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.440]  are way down under Trump.
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:47.800]  That's another achievement that he doesn't get the praise
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:50.280]  he rightfully deserves for.
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.760]  So we'll be sure to continue to track that story.
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:54.920]  They tried to deport this guy 20 times.
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:57.080]  He came back to rape two women.
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:58.760]  God knows what else.
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:01.080]  Breaking news though about the North Korea situation
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:02.120]  which we talked about earlier.
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:06.360]  This is up on drudgeryport.com out of the Washington Post.
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:07.920]  North Korea fires another missile.
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:11.280]  It's latest step towards putting the U.S. within reach.
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:14.240]  North Korea has taken another bold step towards achieving
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:16.560]  its state of goal of being able to send a nuclear weapon
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:19.400]  to the U.S. mainland.
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:22.760]  Can you imagine the panic if that becomes a reality?
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:25.920]  Firing another intercontinental ballistic missile late Friday
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:29.160]  and highlighting the regime's rapid technological progress.
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:32.080]  The missile flew almost straight 45 minutes
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:34.680]  and reached a height of about 2,300 miles
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:37.320]  before crashing into the sea off Japan.
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:41.720]  But if it had been launched on a normal trajectory,
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:45.320]  the missile could theoretically have reached Denver
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:48.920]  and perhaps even Chicago experts said
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:50.920]  the latest provocation compounds the problem facing
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:53.760]  the Trump administration and North Korea's neighbors
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:56.520]  how to stop the regime of Kim Jong-un
[02:13:56.520 --> 02:13:59.840]  from making progress with its nuclear weapons program.
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:04.120]  Now given the fact that Donald Trump's approval rating
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:09.120]  as of today is that its lowest ever 41%,
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:11.360]  I mean, could he go wag the dog?
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:13.000]  That's the big question here.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.440]  Although the polls that I've conducted
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:17.680]  and most of my Twitter followers are obviously
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:21.600]  big Trump supporters say that any potential attack
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:24.400]  on North Korea or attempt to unseat,
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:27.360]  to overthrow the dictatorship of North Korea
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:31.640]  would be way more popular amongst Trump's base
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:33.920]  than for example, the attack on Syria,
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:37.720]  which wasn't popular amongst probably the slight majority
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:39.920]  of Trump's base according to the polls.
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:43.160]  That North Korea attack, if it comes, will be more popular.
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:45.600]  It will be supported by more people
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:47.720]  because again, you don't have the risk,
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:51.040]  although there's obviously a huge risk to South Korea
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:52.600]  to other countries in the region,
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:55.920]  you wouldn't have the wider risk of extremist taking control
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.920]  of a country taking control of nuclear weapons
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:01.440]  because you could have a conflagration with China,
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:04.400]  which could lead to World War III.
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:06.400]  This is the situation we're dealing with,
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:08.400]  a potentially apocalyptic scenario,
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:13.400]  but still one that has more support amongst Trump's base,
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:15.920]  simply because of the horror stories
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:17.080]  that come out of North Korea
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:18.840]  and which have generally been proven true
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:23.360]  by the defectors who come over 200,000 people,
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:26.200]  political dissidents, not even criminals,
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:29.600]  political dissidents who have expressed thought crimes
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:32.320]  literally in gulags, literally in camps
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:34.520]  where the women give birth to babies
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:37.520]  and the guards immediately stamp them to death.
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:40.320]  This is a country where everybody by law
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:43.320]  has to have a radio in their apartment
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:46.800]  broadcasting government propaganda nonstop,
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:49.200]  which can't be turned off.
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.400]  Can you imagine how Orwellian that is?
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:58.400]  This is easily the most authoritarian country in the world.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:02.320]  Its population is enslaved to a cult of dictatorship.
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:05.600]  That's why there is widespread support
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.720]  for actual regime change in this country,
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:11.280]  despite the potential consequences.
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:13.560]  Could we be moving closer towards that,
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:15.120]  given what has happened today
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:17.480]  with yet another North Korea missile launch,
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:21.320]  which they claim, if it was on the right trajectory,
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:24.680]  could have reached Denver or Chicago?
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:26.880]  Absolutely insane story,
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:30.400]  breaking on this Friday afternoon.
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:34.080]  Moving on, though, we'll get back into the migrant crisis.
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.240]  As I said earlier in a little while,
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:37.240]  but this is a big story,
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:40.000]  which I mentioned earlier with Roger Stone.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.800]  Report, top FBI lawyer James A. Baker
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:46.680]  under investigation for leaking classified info to media.
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:48.920]  FBI General Counsel James Baker,
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:52.080]  combi confidant, is allegedly under criminal investigation
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:53.600]  by the Department of Justice
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:56.800]  for leaking classified info to the media.
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:59.560]  Three sources with knowledge of the investigation
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:03.040]  told Surker that Baker is the top suspect
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:05.280]  in an ongoing leak investigation,
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:07.360]  but Surker has not been able to confirm the details
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:09.280]  of what national security information
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:12.440]  or material was allegedly leaked.
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:14.280]  So they finally zeroed in
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:17.160]  on one of these individuals responsible for the leaks.
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:20.560]  Of course, that's what Scaramucci was put there to do.
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:22.480]  He's promised to crack down on that.
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.840]  What will it take for these leaks to stop?
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:27.520]  Now they're even leaking on Scaramucci.
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.920]  He asked them for a period of grace,
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:31.480]  these traitors within the White House.
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:33.040]  He asked them for a honeymoon.
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:35.560]  That lasted all of what, four days?
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:39.320]  Now they're leaking information on his financial history.
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:42.480]  But finally, they've zeroed in on this one individual.
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:44.320]  Basically, someone needs to be put in prison
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:46.080]  for a very long time,
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:49.480]  and then you'll see the leaks dry up overnight.
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:52.000]  That's what Scaramucci's put there to do.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.520]  But I mean, is it too little too late?
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:56.440]  We have Pat Buchanan writing today,
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:59.400]  is Trump entering a kill box?
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:02.720]  This article is posted on infowars.com,
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:05.320]  where he's talking about Jeff Sessions,
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:06.600]  where he's talking about the fact
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:08.440]  as Roger Stone said earlier,
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:11.640]  the Mueller investigation now is basically very little
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:13.600]  to do with Russian collusion,
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:17.240]  and everything to do with dredging up anything
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:20.040]  about Donald Trump, even from way before
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:21.720]  he even ran as a candidate
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:24.280]  on his business financial transactions,
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:26.520]  on who he rented apartments to,
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:30.280]  to find any speck of dirt,
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:32.520]  which they can blow out of all proportions,
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:34.400]  to start the ball rolling,
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:35.960]  to not only de-legitimize,
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:40.240]  but eventually unseat and impeach President Trump.
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:41.760]  That's what this is about.
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:43.320]  It's a pure witch hunt.
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:46.040]  They've got no evidence whatsoever of Russian collusion.
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:48.600]  Meanwhile, over at the DNC,
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:51.880]  you literally have people working within the IT systems,
[02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:53.800]  colluding with foreign governments,
[02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:56.040]  colluding with the Muslim Brotherhood,
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:58.960]  wiring $300,000 to Pakistan,
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:01.480]  smashing up hard drives,
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:04.520]  and Debbie Wasserman Schultz still employs them,
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:05.560]  not only employs them,
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:07.000]  as Roger Stone said earlier,
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.760]  promotes them months after that becomes known.
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:14.720]  Absolutely mammoth monumental scandal
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:16.400]  from within the DNC,
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:19.360]  actual proof of collusion with the foreign government,
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:22.640]  with the foreign terrorist organization, CNN,
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:24.480]  nothing whatsoever to say about it.
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:27.120]  This is how they control reality
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:32.040]  by just ignoring blacklisting the biggest scandal.
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:33.360]  One of the biggest scandals,
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.720]  if not the biggest scandal politically this year,
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:39.280]  being completely blacklisted.
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:41.360]  But we're going to continue talking about it.
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:44.640]  But again, that investigation into Trump,
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:47.640]  any single speck of dirt they can find,
[02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:49.600]  nothing to do with Russian collusion.
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:53.720]  They will use it to impeach, to indict President Trump.
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:54.640]  That's where it's going.
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:57.680]  That was the agenda from the very beginning.
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:59.520]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones show live
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:02.200]  to talk about the latest with the migrant crisis,
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:04.440]  breaking news, info wars.com.
[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:05.280]  Don't go away.
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:07.960]  A great president once said,
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:11.560]  the nine most feared words in the English language.
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:14.240]  I am from the government and I'm here to help.
[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:17.560]  Adequacy of loss, absorbing capacity.
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:18.840]  You call that help?
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:21.040]  That's the mandate approved by the G20.
[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:23.160]  The banks can steal your money.
[02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:25.320]  Well, they can't steal your gold and silver.
[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:26.720]  That you fully control,
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:28.520]  you can have it delivered into an IRA
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.720]  and a depository and a lock and key,
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:31.720]  where you can hide it,
[02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:34.360]  where no one can find it, not even your wife.
[02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:35.200]  What?
[02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:36.040]  Sorry, honey.
[02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:38.480]  Your CDs, money market accounts,
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:40.640]  and savings accounts are all at risk.

[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:06.920]  Today, I'm excited to announce
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:08.720]  that a new limited shipment of DNA forces
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:11.360]  finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:13.840]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:15.000]  who've signed up for auto ship
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.400]  to receive out of stock products like DNA force.
[02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:18.920]  And we are now once again expected
[02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:20.240]  to sell out very, very soon.
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:21.280]  And when it comes to a formula
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:23.480]  that is such a game changer like DNA force,
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:25.080]  we never know when we will be able
[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:27.840]  to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:30.800]  The secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:32.880]  of patented ingredients like CoQ-10,
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:35.760]  systematic enzymes, NAR, lipoic acid,
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:37.360]  BioPQQ and many others.
[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:40.080]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented
[02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:42.000]  175 clinical studies.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.600]  And just one batch of this stuff
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:45.760]  costs us more than $30,000.
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:48.440]  Visit m4slife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:51.080]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA force
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.560]  and unheard of 4.8 out of five stars
[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:55.680]  through our third party certified review agency,

[02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:14.600]  and you want it all tax free.
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:15.880]  That's a tall order.

[02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:20.560]  with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:23.440]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:24.320]  That's true.
[02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:26.200]  But you can have tax free access
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:28.760]  to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:06.880]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.760]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure
[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:12.240]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:13.760]  but the symptoms are there.
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:16.480]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops,

[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:43.600]  especially over the past six, seven months
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:46.760]  when the attacks in the aftermath of the election
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:49.080]  were more intense than ever before
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:52.920]  and you've had our back at every single point
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:56.840]  by getting the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:00.320]  Let's get back into some news right now.
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:03.440]  Of course, there was the big New Yorker article last night
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:05.040]  where Scaramucci came out
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:07.280]  and basically threw some shade at Bannon,
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:11.400]  used some swear words, God forbid, said the F word.
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:13.200]  Well, now he's regretting that today,
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:15.000]  the Daily Caller reports,
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.200]  never should have trusted a reporter.
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:20.360]  Scaramucci responds to the New Yorker piece,
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:22.840]  White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:25.200]  responded with Thursday, New Yorker piece
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:27.920]  by saying he should never have trusted a reporter.
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:29.800]  Scaramucci's tweet implied
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:31.600]  that he would not make that mistake again
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:33.320]  after a New Yorker piece on Scaramucci
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:36.080]  featured numerous quotes from him about White House leaks
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:39.720]  after he unloaded on a reporter during a phone call.
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:41.880]  Quote, I made a mistake in trusting the reporter.
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:42.960]  It won't happen again.
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:46.000]  So Scaramucci basically called up this reporter
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:50.040]  as part of his mission to try and identify leakers
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:52.000]  because this reporter got something from someone
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.760]  within the administration about a private dinner
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:57.720]  that Trump had had with First Lady Melania Trump,
[02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:01.280]  Sean Hannity of Fox News and Bill Shine.
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:05.200]  This was leaked to the New Yorker reporter, Ryan Lizzer.
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:07.680]  So Scaramucci called him, he was incensed,
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:10.000]  he wanted to know the identity of the leaker.
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:13.720]  Different claims, Scaramucci thinks the conversation
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:14.680]  was off record.
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:17.800]  The New Yorker reporter obviously thinks it was on record.
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:19.800]  That's what started this scandal,
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:21.160]  which broke last night.
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:24.120]  Not really a scandal, not a nothing burger.
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:28.840]  Trump Jr., Donald Trump Jr. tweeted this today.
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:31.760]  Shocked, the media is going after at Scaramucci
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:34.040]  for working to cut off their sources and leaks.
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:37.480]  All I know is that he wasn't the lead.
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:40.400]  So that really encapsulates it.
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:42.280]  That's why they hate Scaramucci
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:45.240]  because if he is successful in cracking down
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:48.200]  on these leakers, in putting some of them in prison,
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:50.680]  at least firing them for the time being.
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:52.280]  That's it for the New York Times.
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:54.000]  That's it for the Washington Post.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.400]  That's it for the New Yorker in terms of leaks
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:00.080]  from these traitors, from these turncoats,
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:01.640]  from these never Trumpers,
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:05.040]  from these Obama holdovers within the administration.
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:08.120]  And at that point, Trump can then get on the offensive
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:11.120]  and push forward with the narrative of his agenda
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:12.840]  for successors that he's had,
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:14.920]  which is obviously the economy,
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:17.320]  the illegal border crossings being down,
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:21.480]  moving towards building the wall, et cetera, et cetera,
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:24.120]  not obsessing about hysterical,
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:26.840]  nothing burger Russian conspiracy theories
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:30.040]  and all this backbiting between individuals
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:33.800]  within the administration that don't have Trump's back.
[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:35.720]  That's why they hate Scaramucci.
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:39.720]  That's why they're now trying to bring him down as well.
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:41.560]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:44.000]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones show.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.120]  I'm gonna get into the migrant crisis.
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:47.560]  Huge news with that.
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:48.400]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:50.400]  Breaking news at infowalls.com.
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:51.240]  We'll be back.
[02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:56.640]  We're on the march.
[02:29:56.640 --> 02:29:59.120]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:02.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:08.800]  Duty, honor, country,
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:11.560]  those three hallowed words reverently dictate
[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:15.000]  what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be.
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.120]  They are your rallying points to build courage
[02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:20.840]  when courage seems to fail, to regain faith
[02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:23.240]  when there seems to be little cause for faith,
[02:30:23.240 --> 02:30:26.240]  to create hope when hope becomes forlorn.
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:29.680]  Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of dictation,
[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:31.480]  that poetry of imagination,
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:33.360]  nor that brilliance of metaphor
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:35.200]  to tell you all that they mean.
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:37.320]  The unbelievers will say they are but words,
[02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:39.880]  but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase,
[02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:42.720]  every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite,
[02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:45.320]  every troublemaker, and I am sorry to say
[02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:47.760]  some others of an entirely different character
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:49.160]  will try to downgrade them
[02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:51.640]  even to the extent of mockery and ridicule.
[02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:53.640]  But these are some of the things they do.
[02:30:53.640 --> 02:30:55.320]  They build your basic character.
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:57.320]  They mold you for the future roles
[02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:59.880]  as a custodian of the nation's defense.
[02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:02.600]  This was said on May 12th, 1962
[02:31:02.600 --> 02:31:04.480]  by General Douglas MacArthur.
[02:31:04.480 --> 02:31:07.000]  I'm Joe Biggs with infowalls.com.
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:08.600]  Alex Jones here to tell you about
[02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:10.760]  how you can help spread liberty worldwide.
[02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:13.360]  I'm also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting

[02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:17.440]  For more than a decade,
[02:31:17.440 --> 02:31:19.080]  my favorite coffee has come from
[02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:20.880]  the high mountains of Southern Mexico,
[02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:22.040]  where the Chiapas farmers
[02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:24.520]  grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.

[02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:43.400]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:43.400 --> 02:31:45.280]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee,
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:47.880]  and it's taken us years to secure connections
[02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:50.400]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:19.800]  It's been sold out for months, big waiting lists,
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:22.400]  limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds
[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:23.640]  and to have any California standards.
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:24.880]  Nobody's got something that's good.

[02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:38.800]  designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast
[02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:39.800]  and fungal organisms.

[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:50.480]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on
[02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:52.960]  that have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff
[02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:54.680]  that didn't exist years ago, now it's epidemic.
[02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:56.160]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.600]  and come on here and tell you what it did for them
[02:32:57.600 --> 02:32:59.320]  because regardless, you can't lose your fun

[02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:15.000]  ["The Power Structure"]
[02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.320]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure,
[02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:22.560]  you're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:27.000]  Some of them want to use you, some of them want to use you.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:30.600]  We're live deep in the third hour of this Friday edition
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:32.120]  of the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:33.720]  I'm going to talk about the migrant crisis,
[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:35.640]  the latest on that here in a moment.
[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:38.320]  First, I want to go to this Adam Carolla clip, though,
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:40.520]  because this is quite unusual.
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:43.200]  He got up before a house oversight and government reform
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:45.680]  committee with several other speakers.
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:47.960]  The headline here is out of Washington Free Beacon.
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:49.880]  Adam Carolla goes to Congress, says,
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:53.320]  adults need to take back college campuses.
[02:33:53.320 --> 02:33:56.280]  Comedian Adam Carolla was invited to testify before the Congress
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:58.920]  on the state of free speech at American universities
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:00.880]  and said that it was time for the adults
[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:03.200]  to take back control.
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:07.080]  Here is the clip of Adam Carolla laying it down
[02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:11.200]  on the safe spaces to a ruining, sabotaging free speech
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:11.720]  in America.
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:12.880]  Let's roll it.
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:15.280]  Mr. Carolla, you're recognized for five minutes.
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:15.680]  Thank you.
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:19.280]  It's an honor to be asked to speak in front of you all.
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:20.680]  First, a quick piece of business.
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:24.600]  Do we get to keep these pads?
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:27.400]  This is going to be huge.
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:30.920]  And not that I'm going to, but what do you reckon
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:33.160]  they'll get on eBay?
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:34.480]  I'm not saying I'm going to.
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:39.200]  I'm just pure curiosity.
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:41.960]  I'm not as eloquent as Mr. Shapiro.
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:45.920]  I sort of speak in Beats and off the top of my head.
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:48.120]  I've written a few down for you all today.
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:52.320]  First off, I come from a very blue collar background.
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:55.560]  I grew up in North Hollywood, California.
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:59.520]  My dad was a school teacher, and my mom
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:03.960]  received welfare and food stamps and told me very importantly
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:06.640]  when I was young, when I asked her if she would get a job,
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:09.320]  she said, and lose my welfare benefits.
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:13.520]  No, thank you, which taught me a very valuable lesson, which
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:17.360]  is never to listen to my mom.
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:21.120]  I ended up being a carpenter and then a boxing instructor
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:23.360]  and met Jimmy Kimmel when I taught him
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:27.080]  to box for a morning zoo stunt and eventually made
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:30.240]  my way onto TV and radio.
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:34.160]  In the early days of my career, I toured the country
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:37.120]  with Dr. Drew when we're on Love Line together,
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:39.800]  syndicated radio program also on MTV.
[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:44.000]  And we must have played a hundred college campuses
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:49.440]  with nary a word of negativity and no safe spaces
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:52.320]  and no stuffed animals being handed out.
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:56.480]  Simply went there, set our peace, many controversial ideas
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:00.520]  were exchanged, and that's just what they were exchanged.
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:02.760]  And then we got our paychecks and went home.
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:08.000]  And 15 years later, I went out with Dennis Prager,
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.160]  conservative talk show host, and attempted
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:15.280]  to do a show at Cal State Northridge, where my mother was
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:20.080]  a actual graduate from with a Chicano studies degree,
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:20.920]  believe it or not.
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:25.520]  So she's rolling in dough about now.
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:27.640]  And they pulled the plug on it.
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:31.520]  They gave us no good reason why we couldn't speak there.
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:34.840]  And we actually had to get attorneys involved to go back
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:38.520]  and speak at a later date.
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:40.680]  We're talking a lot about the kids.
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:43.240]  And I think they're just that kids.
[02:36:43.240 --> 02:36:44.720]  We are the adults.
[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:48.360]  And I don't think we are doing the children.
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:52.200]  I mean, these are 18 and 19-year-old kids
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:53.880]  that are at these college campuses.
[02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:57.480]  They grew up dipped in Purell, playing soccer games
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:00.840]  where they never kept score and watching Wah Wah Wubsie.
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:02.800]  And we're asking them to be mature.
[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:07.400]  We need the adults to start being the adults.
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:11.240]  Studies have shown that if you take people
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:13.920]  and you put them in a zero-gravity environment,
[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:16.520]  like astronauts, they lose muscle mass.
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:18.280]  They lose bone density.
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:21.080]  We're taking these kids in the name of protection.
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:24.120]  We're putting them in a zero-gravity environment.
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:27.960]  And they're losing muscle mass in bone density.
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:30.720]  They need to live in a world that has gravity.
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:34.800]  When you need to expose your children to germs and dirt
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:38.480]  in the environment to build up their immune system,
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:41.560]  our plan is put them in a bubble,
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:43.760]  keep them away from everything,
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:45.920]  and somehow they'll come out stronger
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:47.360]  when they merge from the bubble.
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:49.760]  Well, that's not happening.
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:54.760]  Children are the future, but we are the present.
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:37:59.120]  And we're the adults, and we need to act like it.
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:04.120]  And I feel that what's going on on these campuses
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:09.960]  is we need law and order.
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:11.760]  We need to bring back law and order.
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:15.160]  But I think if we just had order,
[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:17.160]  we wouldn't need law.
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:20.720]  So could we just bring back order
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:23.760]  and could the faculty and administration
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:28.760]  on these campuses act like faculty and administration?
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:34.560]  And most importantly, adults who are in charge
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:39.760]  of these kids who need some gravity in their life.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:40.960]  Thank you.
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:41.800]  I'll say.
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:43.920]  And that really gets to the heart of it.
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:46.280]  The responsibility lies with the adults
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:48.800]  as we've seen with these Berkeley protests
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:50.600]  and these other protesters.
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:54.040]  Many of the rioters, not kids, they're not students,
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:56.000]  they're the professors.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.240]  This is the root of the problem.
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:00.600]  Now over in the UK, as we saw this week,
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:02.400]  we've literally got teachers.
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:04.840]  I mean, the media built him as a historian,
[02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:06.720]  but he was just a teacher.
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:10.760]  Teaching kids that a typical Roman family in Britain
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:15.760]  1500 years ago, typical Roman family in Britain was black.
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:19.360]  Absolutely completely historically inaccurate.
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:21.840]  You had hit pieces on me put out after that
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:26.440]  by national newspapers, claiming that I was wrong
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:29.960]  for saying that depicting Victorian era Britain
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:33.560]  as a bunch of Muslim women in hijams, that was ludicrous.
[02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:35.920]  I was owned for saying that because they said,
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:39.280]  oh, there was one mosque built in London
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:41.960]  12 years before Queen Victoria died,
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:45.920]  therefore it's fair to depict Victorian era Britain
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:48.520]  as all Muslim women in hijabs.
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:52.640]  Absolutely incredible disinformation indoctrination.
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:55.560]  They're literally trying to rewrite history.
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:58.240]  I mean, there's a story today out of RT,
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:00.960]  alien toddler skeleton with deformed skull
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:02.760]  unearthed in Crimea.
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:06.240]  So they basically found a one and a half year old boy
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:08.920]  who was born in second century Crimea
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:11.000]  with a deformed skull.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.800]  They're calling it the alien toddler skeleton.
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:15.520]  And that was a similar thing with the debate
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:17.000]  over Roman Britain.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.760]  They found some skeletons.
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:21.600]  I think it was three or four skeletons
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:26.600]  of black people in London who lived in London 1500 years ago.
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:29.440]  Therefore they claimed that Roman Britain
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:33.160]  was ethnically diverse because they found a few skeletons.
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:34.640]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:36.960]  That is as ludicrous as saying that
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:41.160]  because they found this alien toddler skeleton in Crimea
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:46.160]  that second century Crimeans all looked like alien grays
[02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:49.240]  because everyone has to look like this tiny sample
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:50.480]  of the argument you're claiming.
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:55.240]  No, that's a completely historically inaccurate argument.
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:58.280]  Even with all the black slaves that the Romans had
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:40:59.920]  and brought over into Britain,
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:03.720]  it was still a tiny, tiny percentage of the population.
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.920]  It's completely inaccurate to claim
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:08.520]  that Roman Britain was ethnically diverse.
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:10.640]  It's completely inaccurate to claim
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:15.040]  that a typical family in Roman Britain as the BBC did
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:17.960]  was black and depict it as a black family.
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:19.800]  That's not typical.
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:21.520]  That would be incredibly rare.
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:24.920]  Why has every other previous depiction of Roman Britain
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:26.360]  shown all white people,
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:31.360]  including the BBC's own depictions before this 2017 depiction?
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:34.240]  They injected that for politically correct,
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:39.240]  racial tokenism at the expense of historical accuracy.
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:40.840]  That's the issue.
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:42.360]  And that's the issue about what our kids
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:44.240]  are being taught in these schools right now.
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:47.560]  The professors are worse than the kids in many cases.
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:49.480]  And that is the heart of the problem,
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:51.960]  as Adam Carola said in that speech
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:54.760]  in front of a congressional committee.
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:41:57.920]  But let's dip back into some of the migrant news now
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:01.520]  because it continues to wash over us on a daily basis.
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:03.320]  We talked with Tommy Robinson
[02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:06.440]  about the Muslim leader in Australia
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:09.600]  who's saying that Australian women need us to fertilize them.
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:12.560]  He's literally saying the bigoted white people
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:14.760]  should just all kill themselves now
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:16.760]  because they're gonna die out anyway
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:19.880]  and that they need to import vast more numbers of Muslims
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:21.640]  just to maintain the population.
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:24.280]  Of course, that's the myth in itself
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:27.640]  that a declining population is always a bad thing.
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:29.080]  It's not always a bad thing.
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:30.400]  It can be managed.
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:33.160]  But it is true to say that sperm counts are dropping
[02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:36.720]  that white Western Europeans are basically going extinct
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:38.560]  because none of them are having babies.
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:41.520]  So now you have Muslim leaders in Australia
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:43.520]  celebrating that fact
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:47.520]  that white people are basically being ethnically cleansed
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:48.880]  by their own volition.
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:53.000]  We have the BBC refusing to report on a Muslim mob
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:54.960]  who attacked whites for being non-Muslims.
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:56.400]  We reported on that.
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:59.160]  They reported on a guy who made a YouTube video
[02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:01.000]  saying he was gonna kill Muslims.
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.360]  That was hate speech, words.
[02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:05.880]  When it comes to actual violent physical attacks
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:07.600]  on people on the street
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:09.280]  where they're asking people are you Muslim?
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:10.160]  Yes, I'm Muslim.
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:13.920]  They recite the secret code words to prove they're Muslims.
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:14.760]  They don't get attacked.
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:15.880]  They get left alone.
[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:18.840]  They go to the next person who says I'm a Christian
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:21.080]  gets the crap beaten out of him.
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:25.320]  Targeting non-Muslim white people an obvious hate crime.
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:27.360]  It's not even being reported on
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:32.040]  by the local BBC Merseyside section of the news.
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:34.920]  That's how locked down they've got this narrative.
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:37.000]  You had the Labour Council being attacked
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.680]  and then making excuses for it
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:40.760]  as Tommy Robinson talked about.
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:43.200]  Absolutely incredible situation.
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:44.640]  You have the situation in Birmingham
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:48.120]  where a 15-year-old girl got raped twice.
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:50.280]  They said, oh, it was a couple of Asian men.
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:54.040]  They didn't even give specific description of them.
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:55.880]  They're still on the loose.
[02:43:55.880 --> 02:43:57.720]  We have this article out of Breitbart
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:43:59.960]  which is also up on infowars.com.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.160]  Swedish shop refuses woman's service
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:05.200]  for not wearing a hijab.
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:07.640]  A woman in Sweden claims that she was denied service
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:09.760]  at a local Somalian owned shop
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:12.080]  because she was not wearing an Islamic headscarf
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:13.960]  and remarked she felt like she was back
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:16.000]  in her home country of Iran.
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:19.480]  Bearing in mind that the original feminist
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:23.080]  Arab Muslim groups back over 100 years ago,
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:26.440]  one of the first things they did, actual feminists,
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:28.960]  was to discard their veils.
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:31.240]  Now, the hijab is celebrated
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:33.440]  as a symbol of female empowerment
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:36.200]  by Western leftist feminists.
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:38.480]  Absolutely incredible turnaround.
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:39.560]  The article continues,
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:42.200]  the woman, a well-known Swedish female rights activist
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:43.840]  named Shoal of Four,
[02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:45.600]  said that she was out shopping for dresses
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:48.360]  and was shown some by the female retail clerk.
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:50.560]  Shortly after, a man who she did use
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:52.040]  to be the owner of the shop
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:54.320]  spoke with the clerk in Somalia about four
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:56.480]  and her lack of a hijab.
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:44:57.960]  Quote, the woman turned to me and said,
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:00.240]  unfortunately, you cannot buy it.
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:01.440]  Imagine going to a store
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:03.560]  and not buying food and milk, I replied.
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:06.040]  Sweden is a democracy, she replied.
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:07.480]  Is it really?
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:08.640]  Yes, it's a democracy.
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:10.520]  I'll get in with or without a hijab,
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:12.040]  four claimed in her piece.
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:14.360]  So now in some shops in Sweden,
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:17.800]  they're literally barring people from entering,
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:19.560]  preventing them from getting service,
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:21.360]  from being able to buy products
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:23.600]  because they're not wearing a hijab.
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:26.720]  That's how bad it is in Sweden.
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:30.960]  Friends closes only de-radicalization center
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:32.800]  because it doesn't work.
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:35.160]  This is out of Westminster.
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:37.960]  The center, which only opened in February of this year,
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:40.640]  will be closed after one of its residents was caught
[02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:43.000]  attempting to board a flight to Syria,
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:44.520]  obviously to join ISIS.
[02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:46.400]  And another was sentenced to formance in prison
[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:48.800]  for acts of domestic violence.
[02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:52.000]  We're gonna go to Alex, he is live on the air, Alex.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:53.200]  Welcome on.
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:54.040]  What's going on?
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:57.120]  Well, I have really been withoted
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:00.000]  to the incredible information you and Roger Stone
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:03.240]  and Tommy Robinson have been covering today.
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:05.280]  And so I had to pop in here near the end
[02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:09.280]  of your three hour stint before the fourth hour host comes up
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:12.760]  just to point out that if you look
[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:14.160]  at what the globalists are doing,
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:15.840]  they know the West is inclusive.
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:17.960]  They know the West is anti-racist.
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:20.520]  They know the West is anti-tribalist
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:22.480]  via our Christian ethos.
[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:26.080]  And so they're using that against us to basically conquer us.
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:31.080]  And it's just like Austria and Australia and Germany,
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:35.080]  many different public schools banning pork on the school
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:39.440]  lunch because it offends Muslims or Sharia law
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:42.600]  or you gotta wear a jibs or they're now having
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:47.120]  to put gates up around Oktoberfest all over Germany,
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:49.760]  even in Munich in places because the Muslims come in
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:52.280]  and beat people up and attack people
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:54.720]  when they see folks outdoors drinking beer
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:56.840]  or you see a woman walking her dog,
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:46:59.720]  they come over and attack her and say, that is unclean.
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:03.200]  I actually had Muslims about 15 years ago
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:06.120]  when I was walking my dog in a public park come over
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:08.200]  and they knew who I was.
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:11.200]  This is before I really went on the big Jag about Islam
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:13.240]  and they said, you know, Alex, we like your show
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:16.480]  but dogs are unclean, why do you have a dog?
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.640]  So they just can't help but getting to everybody's business.
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:23.200]  If folks get mad at the occasional street preacher
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:25.400]  yelling and screaming at you, that's their free speech,
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:27.600]  I support street preachers, some of them are great,
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:29.240]  some of them are very, very obnoxious.
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:31.400]  I think they hurt their cause more than they help it,
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:34.280]  screaming at you with bad breath that you're going to help.
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:38.680]  That said, with Islam, it's a thousand times that.
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:43.160]  They kill you, they murder you if you don't do what they want
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:48.040]  and they ban having dogs, having cats in Islamic countries.
[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:50.240]  That's the reality.
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:52.960]  Communist China is trying to ban having dogs
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:55.880]  because they want to control every fetus of your life.
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:47:58.720]  They want you loving the state, not your dog,
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:00.360]  not your husband, not your wife.
[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:04.320]  It's total authoritarianism and then we have the left
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:06.240]  trying to bring in authoritarianism
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:07.520]  and making us comply with it.
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:09.160]  But I just wanted to point out today
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:12.520]  when I look at Kim Jong-un firing another missile
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:14.600]  with hydrojectory in the Pacific Ocean,
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:17.000]  I'm only 4,000 miles from him right now
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:20.600]  on the westerly most island, Kauai,
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:22.640]  of the United States territory.
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:24.600]  You're in the great state of Hawaii
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:26.000]  and he's fired another missile,
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.200]  threatening to nuke everybody,
[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:29.760]  admittedly has nuclear weapons
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:31.920]  and it just shows us how much danger we're in
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:33.320]  from authoritarianism.
[02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:37.440]  I can fly to Hawaii for $300.
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:41.720]  I can fly from Texas for about 150 bucks
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:44.480]  to Arizona and then for 300 bucks,
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:46.400]  if I buy my tickets right, fly to Hawaii.
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:49.480]  I can stay in a decent hotel for $200, $300 a night.
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:50.760]  I can eat great food.
[02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:55.760]  I can literally experience God's great creation
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:48:59.360]  and have thousands of choices,
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:01.160]  even if I was a blue collar worker
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:02.920]  and saved my money for six months.
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:07.640]  You compare the medicine, the science, the entertainment,
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:10.840]  the culture of the West to everything else
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:14.600]  and it's so dominant, it makes the head spin.
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:16.600]  But it is grandiose, it's decadent,
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:18.800]  it's sickening at a certain point
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:21.760]  and that's the problem is that then there's a mental illness
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:24.200]  that sets in every culture that becomes decadent
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:26.440]  like Rome and many other cultures
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:28.240]  that we then somehow become cuckold
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:31.160]  and obsessed with the barbarian
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:32.960]  and we bring the barbarian in,
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:36.600]  the barbarian incrementally conditions us
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:38.080]  to put up with their behavior
[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:41.400]  and soon basically takes over
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:43.880]  and uses our own openness against us.
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:45.840]  So it's very important to be thankful
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:48.440]  for the freedoms we have that have been hard fought for
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:52.800]  and have politically been fought over as well
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:55.720]  and to really realize that if we're gonna celebrate
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:58.880]  our collective freedom, we have to recognize,
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:01.400]  as you said, the litmus test of the so-called left
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:04.280]  with USA Today and Reuters and AP
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:05.840]  and Atlantic Monthly and the New York Times,
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:08.560]  Washington Post celebrating the last six months,
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:12.400]  the jib as a symbol of feminism
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:14.240]  and covering up the acid attacks
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:16.800]  and the murders of people for their sexual preference
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:20.000]  and women being killed after they're raped
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.080]  and the insanity of these lecturing scumbags
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:24.600]  telling us how to live our lives.
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:26.960]  But of course they show Romans as black
[02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:28.440]  and say Romans were black.
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:32.400]  I mean, listen, again, it's just a war on history.
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:34.800]  We're not bashing anybody no matter what color they are,
[02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:36.720]  but it's this thing about if you're white,
[02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:40.400]  you don't have a history or culture, it has to be erased.
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:43.440]  The Romans and the Greeks,
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:46.000]  we're gonna skip this breaks, we have more time.
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:47.920]  The Romans and the Greeks,
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:49.880]  there wasn't even a racial thing back then,
[02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:52.000]  there was cultural things.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.080]  And there were so few Africans in Europe
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:55.760]  that it was actually, we read the history books,
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:50:57.840]  a novelty and it was actually popular
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:01.080]  and blacks weren't looked down upon,
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:05.760]  but it was known that groups that founded Greece
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:08.640]  founded Egypt, it was in all the history books
[02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:10.760]  and now they've dug up the oldest mummies
[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:13.560]  and they're all basically Southern European,
[02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:15.120]  Eastern European or Greek.
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.120]  We know this, we know the historians
[02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:20.240]  said the Greeks all had blonde hair, blue eyes
[02:51:20.240 --> 02:51:21.920]  till they got taken over by the Moors.
[02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:24.160]  They, most of the Greece islands
[02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:27.360]  were captured by Muslims out of North Africa
[02:51:27.360 --> 02:51:30.880]  and that's why Greeks have dark hair and dark eyes today.
[02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:32.720]  If you go into some of the more remote islands,
[02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:36.320]  there are Greeks today that look like the Greek statues.
[02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:38.000]  They've got blonde curly hair,
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:39.680]  they were described as having blue eyes.
[02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:41.800]  Again, it doesn't matter to me,
[02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:44.760]  it's that you see the extension of the BBC
[02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:47.160]  saying here's what Britons look like
[02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:48.520]  and here's what Romans look like
[02:51:48.520 --> 02:51:51.320]  and it's a black family in Roman Togos.
[02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:55.560]  This is what is pushed, this is what is done.
[02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:58.800]  Just like Dunkirk about the British Expeditionary Force,
[02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:03.440]  400,000 men or 500,000 whenever it was being driven,
[02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:08.440]  driven by the German invasion into France in 1940, 1941,
[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:11.960]  all the way to the sea, Hermann Göring's Luftwaffe,
[02:52:11.960 --> 02:52:15.000]  bombing them, strafing them for a week
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:18.800]  until all the British citizens got their boats basically,
[02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:21.200]  came across the English Channel and picked everybody up.
[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:24.560]  Of course, there wasn't one black person there
[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:28.920]  because this was 70 years ago before the multiculturalism.
[02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:32.160]  And so now England isn't even for white Britons
[02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:37.000]  because it was always black 2,000 years ago in Brittany,
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:41.000]  according to what we're all told by the BBC.
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:45.840]  Again, this, and so USA Today says,
[02:52:45.840 --> 02:52:48.440]  this is a horrible movie, there are no black people
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:49.760]  and there are no women in combat
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:52.640]  and now they have tour of duty coming out,
[02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:56.320]  World War II game where it's women.
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:52:57.680]  Well, yes, it's actually true
[02:52:57.680 --> 02:53:00.680]  that there were some Russian women conscripted
[02:53:00.680 --> 02:53:02.920]  in the Russian military and a few of them were
[02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:07.720]  in the front lines when it came to the invasion of Berlin,
[02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:10.200]  the Battle of Berlin, but that's it.
[02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:11.640]  And again, it's not putting women down,
[02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:14.440]  it's just sorry, it's not true.
[02:53:14.440 --> 02:53:18.800]  Julius Caesar was a man, Adolf Hitler was a man,
[02:53:18.800 --> 02:53:22.800]  George Washington was a man, Jesus Christ was a man,
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:26.520]  Cleopatra was a woman.
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:28.640]  And so again, it makes everybody like
[02:53:28.640 --> 02:53:32.280]  an enmity with each other where facts and history
[02:53:32.280 --> 02:53:37.280]  are like chits or poker chips to be traded around
[02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:40.760]  and changed and rearranged by these horrible,
[02:53:40.760 --> 02:53:44.240]  drooling control freaks that have gotten us
[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:46.760]  to adopt the language, the culture they want
[02:53:46.760 --> 02:53:50.520]  and now they're down to destroying bedrock basic history.
[02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:52.320]  Now they're down to demolitioning everything.
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:55.640]  But again, this modern thing of the last 60 years
[02:53:56.800 --> 02:54:00.120]  of saying that Egypt wasn't white and it was black
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:02.920]  and it was all taught in all the universities,
[02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:03.920]  it was pushed to work.
[02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:06.480]  There was a big fight about that 60 years ago,
[02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:07.800]  people said, don't be racist,
[02:54:07.800 --> 02:54:09.680]  Egypt was founded by subsaharons.
[02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:12.720]  And folks said, well, all the historians said
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:16.120]  that it was founded by people out of Southern Europe.
[02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:17.680]  And the same folks that migrated down
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:20.600]  to the Grecian Islands, basically Macedonians and others.
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:24.200]  And they said, no, that's not true.
[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:25.440]  It was black people.
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:28.840]  Well, it's true that if you go into the latter part
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:32.000]  of Egypt's history, about a thousand years ago,
[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:36.880]  then the population is Arabic and some sub-saharan.
[02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:39.680]  But they've now gone into the mummies DNA testing
[02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:44.680]  and they were as white as the copper tone girl's butt
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:47.920]  and that's just the reality.
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:49.520]  But again, we're not even,
[02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:52.880]  it's like saying a man and a woman are a man and a woman.
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:55.640]  And if a woman wants to become a man
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:58.640]  and then say she got pregnant and it's gonna have a baby
[02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:00.560]  and then the daily male has the headline,
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:03.960]  first man has baby, and then I knew when I read
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:05.600]  the headline it was gonna be a woman
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:07.400]  who said she was a man and it said,
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:09.320]  well, she was gonna have the sex operation
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:12.400]  and have her genitals, her male genitals cut off,
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:17.200]  her scrotum, her testes and her penis cut off,
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:21.840]  or vice versa, it was a woman who was gonna
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:24.240]  try to have that attached, boy, this gets crazy.
[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:29.160]  So, it's a woman that wants to have it attached, excuse me,
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:31.760]  added, boy, this insanity gets crazy.
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:35.840]  And then she then gets pregnant, has a baby
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:38.120]  and they say a man, even though she hasn't had
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:41.520]  her new penis created, I mean, you cannot make this up,
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:43.880]  ladies and gentlemen, and I'm starting to have to discuss
[02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:46.400]  topics like this here on air, but you've got a woman
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.800]  that says she's a man, still has female genitals,
[02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:52.320]  has a uterus, has ovaries, has a baby,
[02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:56.840]  and they say a man has had a baby.
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:58.960]  No, a woman who thought she was a man had a baby.
[02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:02.240]  It's like saying a walrus decided it was a human
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:05.000]  and then became a jet pilot, or it's like saying
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.840]  I identify as a blind person, dump Drano in my eyes,
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:10.600]  and then make taxpayers pay for me to live on welfare
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:12.400]  because I identify as a blind person
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:15.040]  that much of other mentally ill people say it's okay.
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:17.880]  These things are really happening, as you said, Paul,
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:21.320]  and we have to recognize sanity is the most valuable thing
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:23.280]  out there, and that the corporate elite
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:25.440]  are literally sabotaging society,
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:27.600]  so we don't have a debate about transhumanism,
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:29.280]  a debate about fission fusion,
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:30.880]  a debate about quantum mechanics,
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:33.840]  a debate about all this other stuff that's happening,
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:36.680]  AI computers, quantum computing.
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:39.960]  They want us all running around, not with basic freedoms,
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:42.800]  but with the new freedoms to be as mentally ill
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:45.200]  and as mad as the folks in the Tea Party
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:46.320]  in Alice in Wonderland,
[02:56:46.320 --> 02:56:47.960]  and then there's all the government documents,
[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:50.200]  and university documents, back to the 50s,
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:51.800]  we're gonna make literature ugly,
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:53.200]  we're gonna make cartoons ugly,
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:54.680]  we're gonna make architecture ugly,
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:56.320]  we're gonna make it cool to be a slave,
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:56:57.760]  we're gonna make it cool to be a failure,
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:56:59.200]  we're gonna make it cool to be a slacker,
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:00.800]  we're gonna make it cool to not have kids,
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:02.720]  we're gonna make it cool to be this or that
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:06.520]  and not be heterosexual to totally sabotage society.
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:08.600]  That is a fact, but then the people
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:10.200]  that have been caught in this,
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:11.800]  caught in this miserable system
[02:57:11.800 --> 02:57:13.440]  where they're living in mama's basement,
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:15.080]  they're baristas, Hillary says,
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:18.520]  I hate our slug supporters, they're such scum,
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:21.840]  ah ha ha, Facebook documents admit they hate you,
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:23.120]  they wanna keep you isolated,
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:25.200]  their whole liberal cosmologies, mind control,
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:27.880]  but they don't care because once they're in it, Paul,
[02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:29.720]  they just wanna pull everything else down
[02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:31.440]  and make everything else miserable
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:32.920]  because they bought into the trap
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:34.840]  and now instead of wanting to get out of the trap,
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:36.720]  they wanna control demolition,
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:38.440]  everything else that isn't in the trap,
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:40.800]  believing that if everything sinks to a low level
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:42.160]  and there's a giant sucking sound,
[02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:45.560]  that somehow they'll be transcended, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:46.720]  Oh, it's exactly that, Alex,
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:49.000]  who controls the past controls the future.
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:50.920]  It says Ludacris is saying
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:53.880]  that you could go to Ethiopia and Nigeria
[02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:57.880]  and that this is a typical Ethiopian or Nigerian family
[02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:01.320]  and then show a family with blonde hair, blue eyes,
[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:05.040]  white as snow and say that's a typical Nigerian family.
[02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:05.880]  No!
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:08.280]  Or to say your typical Japanese family
[02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:10.800]  of 2,000 years ago to show me and you and go,
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:12.760]  I'm a woman, now I now identify as one,
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:15.400]  you identify as an Easter Bunny
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:17.200]  and just show an Easter Bunny and say,
[02:58:17.200 --> 02:58:19.680]  this is a typical Japanese family,
[02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:24.040]  a typical Japanese samurai of 1,400
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:29.040]  and just show a, you know, Bugs Bunny with a carrot.
[02:58:29.360 --> 02:58:31.680]  That makes sense, too, doesn't it, Paul?
[02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:34.800]  Absolutely incredible, Alex, the revisionism here
[02:58:34.800 --> 02:58:36.320]  and it's again to push the narrative
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:38.480]  that mass uncontrolled immigration is natural
[02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:40.080]  and for everyone to just lie down in it.
[02:58:40.080 --> 02:58:41.280]  Stay there, do five more minutes
[02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:42.400]  and then the next host is coming up.
[02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:44.320]  Don't leave Paul, you get to finish up with that.
[02:58:44.320 --> 02:58:46.440]  Paul Joseph Watson's done an incredible job.
[02:58:46.440 --> 02:58:48.440]  We salute him and the great crew in Austin
[02:58:48.440 --> 02:58:50.400]  and all you, the audience, the affiliates
[02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:53.400]  and the sponsors and the good Lord above, stay with us.
[02:58:53.400 --> 02:58:54.600]  Two plus two equals four.
[02:58:57.680 --> 02:58:58.840]  Today, I'm excited to announce
[02:58:58.840 --> 02:59:00.640]  the new limited shipment of DNA forces
[02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:03.320]  finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[02:59:03.320 --> 02:59:05.800]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list
[02:59:05.800 --> 02:59:06.960]  who've signed up for auto-ship
[02:59:06.960 --> 02:59:09.360]  to receive out-of-stock products like DNA force
[02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:12.240]  and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:14.560]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game changer
[02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:16.320]  like DNA force, we never know
[02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:17.880]  when we will be able to secure
[02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:19.880]  an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:22.840]  The secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup
[02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:26.320]  of patented ingredients like OQ10, systematic enzymes,
[02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:29.440]  NAR, lipoic acid, BioPQQ and many others.
[02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:32.160]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented
[02:59:32.160 --> 02:59:35.720]  175 clinical studies and just one batch of this stuff
[02:59:35.720 --> 02:59:37.880]  costs us more than $30,000.

[02:59:55.960 --> 03:00:03.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:16.720]  You want answers?
[03:00:16.720 --> 03:00:18.360]  Well, so does me.
[03:00:18.360 --> 03:00:20.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.960 --> 03:00:24.960]  Everything turns out.
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:26.960]  All right, final statement before I watch this.
[03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:30.520]  When I say Roger Stone's coming up with big breaking news,
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:34.800]  we have to basically sit on our Intel for days
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:35.840]  before we released it.
[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:38.040]  And these aren't White House leaks.
[03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:40.160]  These are things that the Patriots on the inside
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:41.720]  want the public to know.
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:45.800]  Now, that intense of discussions with Roger
[03:00:45.800 --> 03:00:49.520]  about the fact that we really should hype this up better
[03:00:49.520 --> 03:00:51.080]  who our sources are.
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:52.920]  I mean, not specifically who our sources are,
[03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:56.160]  but that you're really getting stuff at the New York Times,
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:57.920]  the Washington Post would kill for,
[03:00:57.920 --> 03:01:00.200]  and that they're not going to be getting anymore.
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:01.480]  Because they've been using the fact
[03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:05.840]  that they have some people on the inside,
[03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:08.320]  Rents Prevus is caught right handed,
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:12.840]  to leak stuff, to then spin or twist what the info is.
[03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:17.200]  You're getting directly what's going on.
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:19.360]  And I mean, just like I told you six months ago,
[03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:21.800]  Mr. Scaramucci couldn't get in to see the president.
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:25.040]  You know, the president wanted him as a top advisor.
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:26.480]  And Rents Prevus would walk in and say,
[03:01:26.480 --> 03:01:29.280]  well, the president wants you to resign, leave.
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:30.760]  And then he called up some certain people
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:32.960]  and they said, no, it's all bull, wait, wait,
[03:01:32.960 --> 03:01:34.880]  and want to talk to Trump, just don't leave.
[03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:36.000]  You have been given a letter.
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:39.200]  And then Trump got really mad and said, you're kidding.
[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:40.040]  You're kidding.
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:43.160]  I didn't tell you to be fired.
[03:01:43.160 --> 03:01:45.680]  And so that's why six months later,
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:47.840]  Trump wanted him at the top billing.
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:50.160]  As his own group communications director,
[03:01:50.160 --> 03:01:52.200]  and Prevus came in with a new letter saying
[03:01:52.200 --> 03:01:56.280]  that he was under Prevus and Trump got really upset.
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:02:00.160]  But again, we'll see how far Roger goes with all this,
[03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:02.520]  because I have some other sources as well.
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:04.120]  You know, Scaramucci has some great sources,
[03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:08.080]  but this is high level, high level.
[03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:08.920]  I mean, just like we told you,
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:10.720]  Trump wasn't going to have boots on the ground
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:11.560]  to take out Assad.
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:13.120]  And three days later, he said that word for word.
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:16.840]  I mean, this is coming from high up.
[03:02:16.840 --> 03:02:18.640]  And it's important to know,
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:20.280]  but it's very humbling to realize
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:21.880]  these are just people like us.
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:25.080]  I mean, there's not a bunch of Machiavellian stuff
[03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:25.920]  going on with Trump.
[03:02:25.920 --> 03:02:28.880]  He's really, the 3D chess is not 3D chess books.
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:30.320]  He's just trying to do the right thing,
[03:02:30.320 --> 03:02:32.880]  trying to do common sense economic things we know work
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:34.800]  and cultural things we know work.
[03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:38.200]  He's not doing all the weird scheming that normally goes on.
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:40.080]  That's the big secret is it isn't 3D chess.
[03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:42.440]  He's going back to common sense stuff
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:44.680]  that always worked that was thousands of years
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:46.320]  of 3D learning.
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:49.760]  So it seems super advanced and wild and low.
[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:51.520]  It's called just having integrity.
[03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:54.240]  Paul Watson, what do you say to that?
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:55.600]  No, that's exactly it, Alex.
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:56.920]  And, you know, scaring us,
[03:02:56.920 --> 03:03:00.040]  he's being put into route out the leakers.
[03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:01.480]  That's why the media hates him.
[03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:05.000]  Because if he does his job, it's game over for them.
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:06.720]  He's cut it off at the source.
[03:03:06.720 --> 03:03:09.120]  That's why they're now leaking on him
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:10.880]  and trying to bring him down.
[03:03:10.880 --> 03:03:12.600]  But again, that's why they hate him.
[03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:13.440]  Then on the flip side,
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:15.480]  you got this huge scandal with the DNC
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:16.840]  and Wasserman Schultz.
[03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:18.200]  They're blacklisting that.
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:19.800]  That is absolutely massive.
[03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:20.720]  Foreign collusion,
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:23.720]  colluding with a terrorist organization, proof.
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:25.160]  And they're not talking about that.
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:26.680]  That's a collusion story
[03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:28.680]  which you actually have evidence for.
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:31.280]  They're doing everything they can to bury it, Alex.
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:34.440]  Paul, getting back to the cultural stuff,
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:37.520]  you were making the point that it's meant to erase history
[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:40.040]  and make it okay to just absolutely get rid
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:41.240]  of Western culture.
[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:42.560]  That's the third world invasion.
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:44.880]  Not bring folks in to then assimilate
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:46.080]  and create a great melting pot.
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:47.440]  We all like different cultures.
[03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:51.640]  A mix of things make a lot of diverse food,
[03:03:51.640 --> 03:03:54.520]  clothing, literature, you name it.
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:57.200]  I like a foreign film as much as anybody or a foreign meal.
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:03:59.000]  But it's meaning get rid of our culture
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.640]  and then let the corporates manipulate that.
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:05.640]  And that's really the issue is destroying Western culture,
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:07.720]  not just getting us to run up the white flag.
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:09.320]  That's why we've got to fight it and say,
[03:04:09.320 --> 03:04:11.920]  hey, especially to the so-called minorities,
[03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:13.440]  don't you see the manipulation?
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:15.560]  They're trying to make sure you don't have a birthright
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:17.160]  of being in a free, open society.
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:18.720]  Why'd you try to get here?
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:20.640]  And then why are you trying to dynamite it
[03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:21.600]  once you get here?
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:24.120]  No, that's it, Alex.
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:28.800]  The West is the most open, tolerant, non-racist country.
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:32.080]  I mean, Britain, absolutely tolerant of everybody,
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:35.040]  yet we still get demonized as bigoted as racist.
[03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:37.000]  They're trying to rewrite history
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.560]  to, again, take our birthright away from us.
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:42.920]  As you said, literally saying that women in hijabs,
[03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:46.520]  they're a good depiction of Victorian era Britain.
[03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:49.040]  They actually said that in a national newspaper
[03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:51.600]  and said that I got owned for saying something else.
[03:04:51.600 --> 03:04:52.840]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:53.680]  That's right.
[03:04:53.680 --> 03:04:54.960]  They just say you got owned for being right,
[03:04:54.960 --> 03:04:55.960]  for being on target.
[03:04:55.960 --> 03:04:57.640]  Congress saying I got owned,
[03:04:57.640 --> 03:04:59.520]  for saying there's an attempted kill against the president,
[03:04:59.520 --> 03:05:00.640]  which they now admit there is,
[03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:03.280]  for being totally on target and first, I'm bad.
[03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:04.120]  Great job, Paul.
[03:05:06.720 --> 03:05:07.560]  Are you he-
[03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:09.320]  The Constitutional Convention of 1787
[03:05:09.320 --> 03:05:10.800]  was held strict secrecy,
[03:05:10.800 --> 03:05:13.000]  and at the end of the proceeding, citizens gathered
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:14.080]  outside Independence Hall
[03:05:14.080 --> 03:05:16.560]  to learn what had been produced behind closed doors.
[03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:18.200]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall,
[03:05:18.200 --> 03:05:19.120]  a lady asked him,
[03:05:19.120 --> 03:05:20.720]  well, doctor, what have we got?
[03:05:20.720 --> 03:05:22.320]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:05:22.320 --> 03:05:25.280]  To which he responded, a republic, if you can keep it.
[03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:27.640]  But today, not only have we lost a republic,
[03:05:27.640 --> 03:05:30.040]  but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[03:05:30.040 --> 03:05:32.760]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[03:05:32.760 --> 03:05:34.560]  A republic operates under the rule of law,
[03:05:34.560 --> 03:05:35.920]  which protects individual liberties
[03:05:35.920 --> 03:05:37.640]  so that the majority cannot take away
[03:05:37.640 --> 03:05:38.760]  the rights of the minority.
[03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:40.640]  Under republic, the government and its citizens
[03:05:40.640 --> 03:05:41.920]  all abide by the same laws,
[03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:44.280]  regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:45.560]  A democracy, on the other hand,
[03:05:45.560 --> 03:05:46.840]  only leads to mob rule fueled
[03:05:46.840 --> 03:05:48.640]  by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[03:05:48.640 --> 03:05:50.320]  In a democracy, the individual
[03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:52.560]  or any groups of individuals composing the minority
[03:05:52.560 --> 03:05:54.520]  have no protection against the unlimited power
[03:05:54.520 --> 03:05:55.360]  of the majority.
[03:05:55.360 --> 03:05:57.240]  It is a case of majority over man.
[03:05:57.240 --> 03:05:58.720]  In other words, under democracy,
[03:05:58.720 --> 03:06:00.800]  two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:02.840]  But under a republic, the sheep's right to life
[03:06:02.840 --> 03:06:04.320]  is predicted by the rule of law.
[03:06:04.320 --> 03:06:07.400]  This is Kit Daniels with infowars.com.
[03:06:07.400 --> 03:06:08.680]  As most of you already know,
[03:06:08.680 --> 03:06:11.960]  I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:13.920]  And in the last four or five years,
[03:06:13.920 --> 03:06:15.360]  doing more and more research,
[03:06:15.360 --> 03:06:18.360]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment
[03:06:18.360 --> 03:06:21.680]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors,
[03:06:21.680 --> 03:06:24.960]  in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:06:24.960 --> 03:06:28.160]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[03:06:28.160 --> 03:06:30.600]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing,
[03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:31.560]  and then processing.
[03:06:31.560 --> 03:06:34.160]  And so I set out to develop caveman,
[03:06:34.160 --> 03:06:36.960]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth
[03:06:36.960 --> 03:06:40.840]  from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients
[03:06:40.840 --> 03:06:44.280]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body
[03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:45.280]  at the same time.
[03:06:45.280 --> 03:06:47.680]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[03:06:47.680 --> 03:06:50.360]  We're getting results and we're expanding
[03:06:50.360 --> 03:06:52.880]  in the face of the complete media assault
[03:06:52.880 --> 03:06:55.280]  and winning because of your support.

[03:07:26.120 --> 03:07:29.760]  This natural lotion contains 21% zinc oxide,
[03:07:29.760 --> 03:07:32.200]  which is the largest particle size used,
[03:07:32.200 --> 03:07:34.480]  and we do not use nanoparticles.
[03:07:34.480 --> 03:07:35.760]  The larger the particle,
[03:07:35.760 --> 03:07:38.040]  the safer it is for your body.
[03:07:38.040 --> 03:07:40.360]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin,

[03:08:03.320 --> 03:08:06.920]  and learn more about the new SPF 30 sunscreen lotion.
[03:08:06.920 --> 03:08:34.000]  Welcome.
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:35.760]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:08:35.760 --> 03:08:39.560]  And you're here on the Alec Gilmour show at InfoWars.
[03:08:39.560 --> 03:08:42.480]  Big concert attempts in Washington, DC
[03:08:42.480 --> 03:08:46.160]  as a power struggle clearly ensues
[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:49.520]  inside the Trump administration.
[03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:54.120]  And where the president stands is the crucial question.
[03:08:54.120 --> 03:08:58.400]  We have seen the rise of Anthony Scaramucci,
[03:08:58.400 --> 03:09:01.600]  an unabashed Trump loyalist
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:03.800]  who's taking on the mainstream media
[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:06.520]  and taking on the Republican National Committee
[03:09:06.520 --> 03:09:11.120]  quizlings who infect the Trump White House.
[03:09:11.120 --> 03:09:13.880]  For reasons that are hard to understand,
[03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:16.800]  the nationalist Steve Bannon,
[03:09:16.800 --> 03:09:20.720]  formerly associated with brightbar.com,
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:25.160]  has aligned himself with the so-called pragmatists.
[03:09:25.160 --> 03:09:30.040]  Yes, as we revealed exclusively at InfoWars
[03:09:30.040 --> 03:09:34.560]  only hours ago, it was Reince Priebus
[03:09:34.560 --> 03:09:39.200]  who is responsible for the appointment of Rod Rosenstein,
[03:09:39.200 --> 03:09:43.120]  the man who, acting on his own,
[03:09:43.120 --> 03:09:46.480]  appointed special counsel Robert Mueller,
[03:09:46.480 --> 03:09:50.560]  whose job is to be an executioner of Donald J. Trump.
[03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:56.560]  Incredibly, we can report here exclusively at InfoWars
[03:09:56.560 --> 03:10:01.280]  that Rosenstein was appointed at the behest of Congressman
[03:10:01.280 --> 03:10:03.480]  Elijah Cummings,
[03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:08.640]  the African-American left-wing Democrat from Baltimore.
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:11.680]  Yes, you heard that correctly.
[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:14.960]  Priebus took a job recommendation
[03:10:14.960 --> 03:10:17.120]  from a left-wing Democrat,
[03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:18.840]  and other than Maxine Waters,
[03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:23.840]  perhaps the single greatest Trump aider in the US House.
[03:10:23.840 --> 03:10:27.840]  Cummings has attacked me personally, repeatedly,
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:32.840]  claiming falsely that I had some traffic with the Russians
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:36.840]  in an attempt to affect the 2016 election.
[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:40.840]  Here is the latest status.
[03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:45.840]  Reince Priebus is the Cato Katelyn
[03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:47.840]  of the Trump administration.
[03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:51.840]  He's the house guest who doesn't know when to leave,
[03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:54.840]  and like Cato Katelyn,
[03:10:54.840 --> 03:10:59.840]  he jumped on an airplane to Long Island with the president today
[03:10:59.840 --> 03:11:03.840]  in a desperate bid to save his job.
[03:11:03.840 --> 03:11:08.840]  It's abundantly clear that the president has had it
[03:11:08.840 --> 03:11:11.840]  with the leadership of Mr. Priebus,
[03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:16.840]  and I continue to predict that his days are limited.
[03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:19.840]  But like Cato Katelyn,
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:23.840]  Priebus doesn't seem to know how to read the tea leaves.
[03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:26.840]  Doesn't seem to understand the signals he's getting
[03:11:26.840 --> 03:11:31.840]  from Donald J. Trump that it's time to leave.
[03:11:31.840 --> 03:11:36.840]  And then there's the question of who will follow Mr. Priebus,
[03:11:36.840 --> 03:11:38.840]  an all-important question,
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:43.840]  because some on this list are problematic.
[03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:47.840]  For example, there is discussion now,
[03:11:47.840 --> 03:11:49.840]  now confirmed at the U.S.
[03:11:49.840 --> 03:11:52.840]  pardon me, first reported on Infowars
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:55.840]  and now confirmed by the New York Times
[03:11:55.840 --> 03:11:59.840]  that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly
[03:11:59.840 --> 03:12:05.840]  is on the short list of those who would replace Priebus.
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:08.840]  As we discussed yesterday,
[03:12:08.840 --> 03:12:12.840]  ill veteran David Urban very highly thought of
[03:12:12.840 --> 03:12:15.840]  because of the blood and guts effort
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:17.840]  that he waged in Pennsylvania
[03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:21.840]  to carry the crucial Keystone State for Donald Trump,
[03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:25.840]  has taken himself out of consideration.
[03:12:25.840 --> 03:12:28.840]  But there are new reports
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:33.840]  that longtime Washington fixture Wayne Berman,
[03:12:33.840 --> 03:12:36.840]  an enormously capable individual
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:38.840]  who has represented Donald Trump
[03:12:38.840 --> 03:12:41.840]  and the Trump Organization in the past,
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:44.840]  may be under consideration for the chief of staff
[03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:46.840]  position.
[03:12:46.840 --> 03:12:49.840]  Berman, who was a colleague of mine
[03:12:49.840 --> 03:12:54.840]  at the firm of Black, Manafort, Stone and Atwater
[03:12:54.840 --> 03:12:56.840]  almost 40 years ago,
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:13:00.840]  is known as one of the most savvy operators in Washington.
[03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:04.840]  Someone who has deep relationships in the media,
[03:13:04.840 --> 03:13:07.840]  deep relationships in the Congress,
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:11.840]  but a strong and trustful relationship
[03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:13.840]  with President Donald Trump.
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:16.840]  Roger Berman would certainly be superior
[03:13:16.840 --> 03:13:20.840]  to any of the other candidates that are currently being named.
[03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:23.840]  Alex, I think that's the lay of the land.
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:27.840]  As you know, personnel is policy.
[03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:29.840]  That's why the decision on the chief of staff
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:33.840]  coming up shortly is absolutely crucial.
[03:13:33.840 --> 03:13:37.840]  Well, I'm going to be riveted via the InfoWars iPhone Free app
[03:13:37.840 --> 03:13:39.840]  while I'm here with my family
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:42.840]  in the next 45 minutes that you have left transmitting here
[03:13:42.840 --> 03:13:45.840]  46, 47 minutes you have left,
[03:13:45.840 --> 03:13:47.840]  but I just had to come in here
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:49.840]  and we're going to skip this next break
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:51.840]  coming up to see a little bit more time
[03:13:51.840 --> 03:13:53.840]  to bring up obviously the big issue here.
[03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:55.840]  They know now that Trump is going to purge
[03:13:55.840 --> 03:13:57.840]  the people that have been leaking,
[03:13:57.840 --> 03:13:59.840]  the deep staters.
[03:13:59.840 --> 03:14:02.840]  We know that he now has the lay of the land.
[03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:04.840]  We understand that now even Fox News
[03:14:04.840 --> 03:14:06.840]  has intensified their attacks on Trump,
[03:14:06.840 --> 03:14:08.840]  their backhanded attacks.
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:10.840]  They're desperate and they've now signaled
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:13.840]  going back three weeks to go internally,
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:16.840]  but now publicly that they are preparing
[03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:19.840]  to go after Trump physically,
[03:14:19.840 --> 03:14:22.840]  and the Secret Service has visited the pastor,
[03:14:22.840 --> 03:14:24.840]  Brown, who met with the president
[03:14:24.840 --> 03:14:26.840]  and also senior members of Congress
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:29.840]  who discussed the plan to overthrow the president violently.
[03:14:29.840 --> 03:14:31.840]  He has now confirmed that indeed
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:33.840]  his congressional source said the plan
[03:14:33.840 --> 03:14:35.840]  is to violently overthrow the president,
[03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:37.840]  but the Secret Service came to him
[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:39.840]  and demanded his source in Congress.
[03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:41.840]  He said, you have to subpoena me,
[03:14:41.840 --> 03:14:45.840]  but why would you do that if you're the Secret Service?
[03:14:45.840 --> 03:14:50.840]  You have globalists on television
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:51.840]  all over the place saying,
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:53.840]  overthrow the president violently.
[03:14:53.840 --> 03:14:56.840]  You have the former CIA director
[03:14:56.840 --> 03:14:58.840]  with the former head of national intelligence,
[03:14:58.840 --> 03:15:01.840]  you have Brennan and Clapper on the Aspen Institute TV program
[03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:03.840]  hosted by Will Plitzer saying
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:05.840]  a physical overthrow is coming
[03:15:05.840 --> 03:15:06.840]  outside of impeachment.
[03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:07.840]  We're going to remove him.
[03:15:07.840 --> 03:15:09.840]  You've got Atlantic monthly calling for it.
[03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:11.840]  You've got it being discussed
[03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:13.840]  and shopped around at the Pentagon
[03:15:13.840 --> 03:15:16.840]  by former Obama appointees that are high level.
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:18.840]  You've got all this unfolding,
[03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:21.840]  and then you've got Al Gore going on The Late Late Show
[03:15:21.840 --> 03:15:23.840]  two nights ago and saying,
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:25.840]  don't worry, he's going to be removed
[03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:26.840]  in the next few months,
[03:15:26.840 --> 03:15:28.840]  and a big constitutional crisis is coming,
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:30.840]  and everybody's got to just come together
[03:15:30.840 --> 03:15:32.840]  and sit down and take it when it happens.
[03:15:32.840 --> 03:15:33.840]  That's what Brennan's saying.
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:35.840]  So the big issue is what do we do
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:38.840]  as the American people to get the word out about this,
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:40.840]  because they simultaneously have media matters,
[03:15:40.840 --> 03:15:42.840]  the mouth of Soros, saying,
[03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:46.840]  I'm crazy and never sourcing anything I said,
[03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:48.840]  because I was sourcing real clips.
[03:15:48.840 --> 03:15:51.840]  They just show text comments and edited video
[03:15:51.840 --> 03:15:53.840]  to make it sound like I'm just out of the blue saying
[03:15:53.840 --> 03:15:55.840]  they're planning to overthrow the president.
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:15:57.840]  They've announced plans to overthrow him.
[03:15:57.840 --> 03:15:59.840]  They've even had little commenters and bots going,
[03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:00.840]  look how insane he is.
[03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:02.840]  No one's saying this.
[03:16:02.840 --> 03:16:04.840]  So that's how crazy they are.
[03:16:04.840 --> 03:16:05.840]  They're all over the place saying,
[03:16:05.840 --> 03:16:06.840]  kill him, overthrow him.
[03:16:06.840 --> 03:16:08.840]  A top writer, top authors put out a book
[03:16:08.840 --> 03:16:10.840]  about how they should kill the president.
[03:16:10.840 --> 03:16:12.840]  This is all out there.
[03:16:12.840 --> 03:16:15.840]  It's a crescendo of drum beating,
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:17.840]  and then they're moving forward,
[03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:19.840]  but when we try to cause a debate about it,
[03:16:19.840 --> 03:16:21.840]  as they sell it, normalize it,
[03:16:21.840 --> 03:16:23.840]  they say we're insane, it doesn't exist.
[03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:26.840]  So what do you make of all this, Roger Stone?
[03:16:26.840 --> 03:16:28.840]  I'm going to punch out and let you take over,
[03:16:28.840 --> 03:16:31.840]  because the system is really panicking now,
[03:16:31.840 --> 03:16:33.840]  as they realize they can't compromise Trump,
[03:16:33.840 --> 03:16:36.840]  and he's already decimated much of their globalist operations.
[03:16:36.840 --> 03:16:39.840]  Back to Roger Stone for infowars.com and all his shows.
[03:16:42.840 --> 03:16:44.840]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:16:44.840 --> 03:16:46.840]  I think you've hit it right on the head.
[03:16:46.840 --> 03:16:50.840]  Here is why you see this hysteria by those
[03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:54.840]  who are talking about the removal of the president.
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:16:57.840]  I can report exclusively to InfoWars
[03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:00.840]  that the president now understands completely
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:04.840]  the implications of the FISA renderings
[03:17:04.840 --> 03:17:08.840]  at the very end of the Obama administration.
[03:17:08.840 --> 03:17:12.840]  This has been presented to the president as a formal option.
[03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:19.840]  He understands that Clapper, Brennan, Jarrett, Rice,
[03:17:19.840 --> 03:17:22.840]  and presumably the president of the United States himself
[03:17:22.840 --> 03:17:26.840]  had knowledge in advance of the willful,
[03:17:26.840 --> 03:17:30.840]  unconstitutional, illegal mass surveillance
[03:17:30.840 --> 03:17:33.840]  of tens of thousands of Americans,
[03:17:33.840 --> 03:17:38.840]  including yours truly, for strictly political purposes.
[03:17:38.840 --> 03:17:43.840]  This is jail time for the frontline of the Obama administration.
[03:17:43.840 --> 03:17:46.840]  And they know that they are in jeopardy.
[03:17:46.840 --> 03:17:49.840]  That is what explains this hysteria.
[03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:52.840]  I got a report from a White House staffer
[03:17:52.840 --> 03:17:56.840]  only minutes ago that this option has been placed
[03:17:56.840 --> 03:17:59.840]  in front of the president, and he is mulling it
[03:17:59.840 --> 03:18:04.840]  on his way to Long Island for his appearance today.
[03:18:04.840 --> 03:18:08.840]  And I think that explains the absolute hysteria
[03:18:08.840 --> 03:18:12.840]  that you're hearing from the alt-left
[03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:18.840]  and from those who seek to undo the Trump administration.
[03:18:18.840 --> 03:18:22.840]  Additionally, there is, at this point,
[03:18:22.840 --> 03:18:25.840]  appears to be at least a tentative decision
[03:18:25.840 --> 03:18:30.840]  to keep Attorney General Jeff Sessions in place.
[03:18:30.840 --> 03:18:33.840]  This is based, of course, on the idea
[03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:37.840]  that perhaps Sessions has got the message.
[03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:40.840]  Now, as we know from history,
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:45.840]  efforts to root out the leakers by the last four presidents
[03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:49.840]  have been notably unsuccessful.
[03:18:49.840 --> 03:18:52.840]  The announcement by the Attorney General
[03:18:52.840 --> 03:18:57.840]  that he would now pursue a probe into the leakers
[03:18:57.840 --> 03:19:01.840]  is largely, sadly, a waste of time.
[03:19:01.840 --> 03:19:06.840]  In fact, we know that a far more effective approach
[03:19:06.840 --> 03:19:10.840]  against the left would be the indictment of the Obama frontline.
[03:19:10.840 --> 03:19:16.840]  There is national security team for the aforementioned surveillance
[03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:20.840]  at the same time going after Bill and Hillary Clinton
[03:19:20.840 --> 03:19:26.840]  and their associates for the thievery at the Clinton Foundation.
[03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:30.840]  That is the double whammy that the left fear.
[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:33.840]  That is the double whammy that could leave
[03:19:33.840 --> 03:19:36.840]  two presidents incarcerated.
[03:19:36.840 --> 03:19:39.840]  That's why the hysteria.
[03:19:39.840 --> 03:19:42.840]  It's very interesting to watch the criminal enterprise
[03:19:42.840 --> 03:19:45.840]  that is media matters for America.
[03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:48.840]  Researchers that I'm working with can detail
[03:19:48.840 --> 03:19:51.840]  the illegal activities and the trafficking of cash
[03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:54.840]  in violation of both IRS regulation
[03:19:54.840 --> 03:19:57.840]  and federal election law.
[03:19:57.840 --> 03:19:59.840]  And when they began attacking us,
[03:19:59.840 --> 03:20:02.840]  as they began two days ago,
[03:20:02.840 --> 03:20:07.840]  attacking me over my exposure of the role of John McCain
[03:20:07.840 --> 03:20:15.840]  in the fusion GPS phony Russian dossier dog scandal,
[03:20:15.840 --> 03:20:20.840]  which seems to get more and more serious by the moment.
[03:20:20.840 --> 03:20:24.840]  We learn every week that the woman lawyer
[03:20:24.840 --> 03:20:27.840]  who met with Don Trump Jr.
[03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:30.840]  was not only allowed into the company country
[03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:36.840]  despite her obtaining of a visa by the FBI,
[03:20:36.840 --> 03:20:38.840]  but we now have photographs of her
[03:20:38.840 --> 03:20:41.840]  in John McCain's office in meeting,
[03:20:41.840 --> 03:20:45.840]  photographs of her and Hillary Clinton demonstrations,
[03:20:45.840 --> 03:20:50.840]  and now tying her directly to fusion GPS.
[03:20:50.840 --> 03:20:55.840]  The president yesterday tweeted regarding FBI director McCabe,
[03:20:55.840 --> 03:20:59.840]  or I should say, acting FBI director McCabe.
[03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:03.840]  Not only did McCabe's wife receive $700,000
[03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:07.840]  for a state senate race courtesy of Bill and Hillary Clinton,
[03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:14.840]  essentially money laundered through Virginia Governor Terry McCallan.
[03:21:14.840 --> 03:21:18.840]  But more importantly, McCabe authorized the use
[03:21:18.840 --> 03:21:22.840]  of $50,000 of our tax dollars
[03:21:22.840 --> 03:21:27.840]  for an effort to obtain the phony dossier
[03:21:27.840 --> 03:21:31.840]  that was invented by operative Chris Steele
[03:21:31.840 --> 03:21:35.840]  in an effort to smear the president
[03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:38.840]  accusing him of sexual improprieties
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:41.840]  in Moscow many years ago,
[03:21:41.840 --> 03:21:45.840]  a charge that has been completely and totally debunked,
[03:21:45.840 --> 03:21:48.840]  a charge that is fake,
[03:21:48.840 --> 03:21:51.840]  but was designed to destroy the president.
[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:54.840]  When I pointed out John McCain's role
[03:21:54.840 --> 03:21:57.840]  in getting the document picked up in Europe
[03:21:57.840 --> 03:21:59.840]  and brought to the United States,
[03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:03.840]  that got me the vilification of media matters.
[03:22:03.840 --> 03:22:05.840]  What these clowns don't understand
[03:22:05.840 --> 03:22:08.840]  is that I wear their attacks on me
[03:22:08.840 --> 03:22:10.840]  like a badge of honor,
[03:22:10.840 --> 03:22:12.840]  because they would not be attacking me,
[03:22:12.840 --> 03:22:15.840]  but for my effectiveness.
[03:22:15.840 --> 03:22:17.840]  And the reason that they attack info wars
[03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:19.840]  and they attack you, Alex Jones,
[03:22:19.840 --> 03:22:21.840]  is for the same reason,
[03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:24.840]  because we are the tip of the spear.
[03:22:24.840 --> 03:22:27.840]  We are the ongoing effort
[03:22:27.840 --> 03:22:29.840]  to take out the globalists
[03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:33.840]  and help Donald Trump assert his agenda
[03:22:33.840 --> 03:22:36.840]  for real reform.
[03:22:36.840 --> 03:22:39.840]  This is not a bad time to ask you once again
[03:22:39.840 --> 03:22:42.840]  to go to the info wars.com store
[03:22:42.840 --> 03:22:44.840]  and give us the support we need.
[03:22:44.840 --> 03:22:47.840]  You see, we don't have a deep pocketed George Soros
[03:22:47.840 --> 03:22:49.840]  sitting in the background
[03:22:49.840 --> 03:22:53.840]  writing big check, keep info wars on the air.
[03:22:53.840 --> 03:22:58.840]  We don't have super multinational corporations
[03:22:58.840 --> 03:23:02.840]  financing our operations here at info wars.com.
[03:23:02.840 --> 03:23:05.840]  We only have you, the American people,
[03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:07.840]  and we must count on you
[03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:10.840]  to go to the store and give us the support we need.
[03:23:10.840 --> 03:23:13.840]  It's a win-win because there is no product
[03:23:13.840 --> 03:23:16.840]  that you can buy at info wars.com
[03:23:16.840 --> 03:23:18.840]  that will disappoint you.
[03:23:18.840 --> 03:23:21.840]  The super blue toothpaste is a favorite of mine
[03:23:21.840 --> 03:23:24.840]  and those in the stone family.
[03:23:24.840 --> 03:23:26.840]  If you've ever seen my wife, Nydia,
[03:23:26.840 --> 03:23:29.840]  you know she has a gleaming white smile
[03:23:29.840 --> 03:23:33.840]  and she attributes it to the super blue toothpaste.
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:36.840]  She believes and she's used all the product
[03:23:36.840 --> 03:23:38.840]  you can find in a drug store.
[03:23:38.840 --> 03:23:43.840]  She believes between that and the entire line
[03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:47.840]  of oral care product available at the store
[03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:50.840]  that she has found the very best dental product
[03:23:50.840 --> 03:23:52.840]  that you can find.
[03:23:52.840 --> 03:23:56.840]  And when you buy, you're not only getting the very best
[03:23:56.840 --> 03:23:59.840]  with literally thousands of testimonials
[03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:01.840]  and satisfied customers,
[03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:05.840]  but you're also helping finance the fight for freedom,
[03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:08.840]  financing the fight for our free prep,
[03:24:08.840 --> 03:24:11.840]  financing the fight for the First Amendment.
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:14.840]  So Fred, please take a moment,
[03:24:14.840 --> 03:24:18.840]  go to the store here at info wars.com
[03:24:18.840 --> 03:24:21.840]  and support us with any one of the selection
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:23.840]  of the fine product here.
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:25.840]  And if you're not interested in our herbs
[03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:29.840]  or our other all natural formulas or our toothpaste,
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:32.840]  well, then you can help by grabbing a t-shirt.
[03:24:32.840 --> 03:24:37.840]  For example, the Trump Pence 2020 t-shirts
[03:24:37.840 --> 03:24:41.840]  or the Hillary or prison 2017 t-shirts.
[03:24:41.840 --> 03:24:46.840]  That's where you will find that you will wear these
[03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:51.840]  and meet other like minded patriots
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:53.840]  who share our views.
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:58.840]  One of my all time favorite, the CNN is big news t-shirt.
[03:24:58.840 --> 03:25:02.840]  I'm going to be wearing this one at Politicon this weekend
[03:25:02.840 --> 03:25:05.840]  in Pasadena, California.
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:08.840]  So you can get one of these
[03:25:08.840 --> 03:25:11.840]  and you're not only supporting the revolution,
[03:25:11.840 --> 03:25:15.840]  you're not only supporting the fight for reform,
[03:25:15.840 --> 03:25:18.840]  but you're helping us here at infowars.com.
[03:25:18.840 --> 03:25:21.840]  Now you're looking at the famous icon
[03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:24.840]  at Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[03:25:24.840 --> 03:25:28.840]  This is the shirt that Alex Jones put in the history book.
[03:25:28.840 --> 03:25:31.840]  I designed it and then Alex Jones sponsored a contest
[03:25:31.840 --> 03:25:35.840]  here at info wars that allowed us to break through
[03:25:35.840 --> 03:25:39.840]  the mainstream media blackout of the story
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:43.840]  of Bill Clinton and his serial sexual assault
[03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:46.840]  against multiple women.
[03:25:46.840 --> 03:25:49.840]  You see the mainstream media wanted to call this
[03:25:49.840 --> 03:25:53.840]  infidelities or indiscretion,
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:56.840]  but the American people know better.
[03:25:56.840 --> 03:26:01.840]  So please go to the store, grab the product of your choice
[03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:05.840]  knowing that you're going to help not only the fight for freedom
[03:26:05.840 --> 03:26:10.840]  but also help us not only get yourself a great product
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:16.840]  but help us stay alive as we are under attack every day,
[03:26:16.840 --> 03:26:20.840]  not just from the clowns that media matters for America,
[03:26:20.840 --> 03:26:26.840]  but from the tech lab, from Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[03:26:26.840 --> 03:26:31.840]  Believe me, they would seek to limit our ability to reach you
[03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:35.840]  and they do it every day through the manipulation of algorithms
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:41.840]  and a hundred other computer tricks that are designed to stop Trump's revolution.
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:49.840]  They know that it is only through a robust and vibrant alternative media
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:55.840]  that our revolution can succeed and that's why they seek to block us
[03:26:55.840 --> 03:26:58.840]  with a thousand different computer tricks.
[03:26:58.840 --> 03:27:00.840]  How can you circumvent this?
[03:27:00.840 --> 03:27:02.840]  There are two important ways.
[03:27:02.840 --> 03:27:06.840]  If you have a Twitter feed, if you have a Facebook feed,
[03:27:06.840 --> 03:27:11.840]  if you're at Snapchat or Instagram, you are an army of one.
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:17.840]  When you see a compelling story you like on InfoWord or Breitbart
[03:27:17.840 --> 03:27:24.840]  or the Daily Caller or Town Hall or any other number of liberty-oriented sites,
[03:27:24.840 --> 03:27:30.840]  take that link and retweet it, repost it, send it to your friends,
[03:27:30.840 --> 03:27:33.840]  send it to your family and ask them to do the same.
[03:27:33.840 --> 03:27:38.840]  This is how one individual can step up in the fight for liberty
[03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:48.840]  and help us defeat those who simply now fall back on censorship as their strategy.
[03:27:48.840 --> 03:27:51.840]  This is not an inexpensive fight, folks.
[03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:57.840]  We are hoping to have extraordinary expansion here at InfoWords.com.
[03:27:57.840 --> 03:28:01.840]  I myself have agreed to go to five days a week with Alex Jones,
[03:28:01.840 --> 03:28:06.840]  an hour at least, telling you the latest developments from the Trump White House
[03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:09.840]  and what's going on in Washington.
[03:28:09.840 --> 03:28:12.840]  You're not going to hear this at all.
[03:28:12.840 --> 03:28:17.840]  You're not going to get it at any place else other than InfoWords
[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:20.840]  and that's why we need your support.
[03:28:20.840 --> 03:28:24.840]  Building new studios, bringing on new technology,
[03:28:24.840 --> 03:28:28.840]  hiring new people, this all costs money,
[03:28:28.840 --> 03:28:33.840]  but it's worth it because the expansion of InfoWords.com
[03:28:33.840 --> 03:28:39.840]  is the way we win the revolution, the way we save America.
[03:28:39.840 --> 03:28:41.840]  We need your support.
[03:28:41.840 --> 03:28:44.840]  I can't say it more strongly or more infatically.
[03:28:44.840 --> 03:28:46.840]  Please, folks, go to the store.
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:48.840]  Find the products you like.
[03:28:48.840 --> 03:28:52.840]  We've got some sales on right now that are truly extraordinary.
[03:28:52.840 --> 03:28:54.840]  Help us help you.
[03:28:54.840 --> 03:28:56.840]  Help us help America.
[03:28:56.840 --> 03:29:01.840]  Help us stand tall in the fight against the globalists.
[03:29:01.840 --> 03:29:05.840]  I'm Roger Stone and I'm proud to be with you here at InfoWords.
[03:29:05.840 --> 03:29:09.840]  I'm excited about going to five days a week.
[03:29:09.840 --> 03:29:12.840]  I'm going to be bringing you the very best breaking news
[03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:15.840]  out of Washington and the Trump administration.
[03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:19.840]  I think people know we have sources that are better
[03:29:19.840 --> 03:29:22.840]  than any other alternative outlet.
[03:29:22.840 --> 03:29:25.840]  I'm Roger Stone and we'll be right back.
[03:29:28.840 --> 03:29:32.840]  I am also going to report to you on the very latest
[03:29:32.840 --> 03:29:37.840]  on the Bundy trial going on in Nevada where we last week
[03:29:37.840 --> 03:29:40.840]  were among the first called for a pardon
[03:29:40.840 --> 03:29:43.840]  for the Bundy ranchers and their supporters.
[03:29:43.840 --> 03:29:48.840]  The latest actions by the federal judge there will curl your ears.
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:51.840]  It's a complete denial of due process
[03:29:51.840 --> 03:29:55.840]  and an attempt to crush the spirit of those brave Americans
[03:29:55.840 --> 03:30:24.840]  who stood up against the Bureau of Land Management.
[03:30:25.840 --> 03:30:29.840]  I'm Roger Stone and I'm proud to be with you today.
[03:30:29.840 --> 03:30:58.840]  Thank you very much.
[03:30:59.840 --> 03:31:06.840]  I'm David Knight.
[03:31:29.840 --> 03:31:55.840]  Thank you very much.
[03:31:55.840 --> 03:32:24.840]  Thank you very much.
[03:32:24.840 --> 03:32:51.840]  Thank you very much.
[03:32:51.840 --> 03:33:20.840]  Thank you very much.
[03:33:20.840 --> 03:33:26.840]  Welcome back.
[03:33:26.840 --> 03:33:29.840]  I'm Roger Stone here at theinfowars.com
[03:33:29.840 --> 03:33:33.840]  and the Alex Jones show delighted to be with you.
[03:33:33.840 --> 03:33:37.840]  As I indicated in the last segment,
[03:33:37.840 --> 03:33:44.840]  incredible developments in the trial of the Bundy ranchers
[03:33:44.840 --> 03:33:47.840]  and their supporters in Nevada.
[03:33:47.840 --> 03:33:54.840]  Judge Gloria Navarro, an appointee of Senator Harry Reid,
[03:33:54.840 --> 03:34:00.840]  has now barred the jury from hearing the audio tape
[03:34:00.840 --> 03:34:05.840]  of the transmissions between the Bureau of Land Management
[03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:10.840]  and their sharpshooters where they were specifically told
[03:34:10.840 --> 03:34:14.840]  shoot to kill and ask questions later.
[03:34:14.840 --> 03:34:19.840]  This precipitated sniper focusing on the Bundy children
[03:34:19.840 --> 03:34:26.840]  and the release of police dog against members of the Bundy family.
[03:34:26.840 --> 03:34:31.840]  For those of you who are unfamiliar with what has transpired,
[03:34:31.840 --> 03:34:36.840]  the Bundy ranchers were the last family of ranchers farming,
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:41.840]  or should say ranching, in Clark County, Nevada.
[03:34:41.840 --> 03:34:46.840]  And when they fell behind in their payments
[03:34:46.840 --> 03:34:49.840]  to the Bureau of Land Management,
[03:34:49.840 --> 03:34:55.840]  the government launched a Waco-like assault on the Bundy compound.
[03:34:55.840 --> 03:34:59.840]  And when other ranchers from across the West
[03:34:59.840 --> 03:35:03.840]  gathered in support of the Bundy,
[03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:07.840]  they were arrested where they have now been denied
[03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:12.840]  either their first or second amendment rights.
[03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:18.840]  What's outrageous is the attempt by the government
[03:35:18.840 --> 03:35:21.840]  and specifically by Judge Navarro
[03:35:21.840 --> 03:35:26.840]  to deny the Bundy's any legal defense.
[03:35:26.840 --> 03:35:30.840]  They're not allowed to argue their first amendment rights.
[03:35:30.840 --> 03:35:35.840]  They're not allowed to argue their second amendment rights.
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:40.840]  They're not allowed to argue their right to free assembly.
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:43.840]  What is happening here is a disgrace.
[03:35:43.840 --> 03:35:47.840]  Let's cut to my speech in Nevada last week
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:52.840]  where I called on the President to review this case
[03:35:52.840 --> 03:35:58.840]  and to pardon the Bundy in the name of Justice and Mercy.
[03:35:58.840 --> 03:36:00.840]  Let's see the video.
[03:36:00.840 --> 03:36:03.840]  I have known Donald Trump,
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:07.840]  President of the United States for 40 years.
[03:36:07.840 --> 03:36:11.840]  He is a just man.
[03:36:11.840 --> 03:36:13.840]  He is a decent man.
[03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:15.840]  He is an honest man.
[03:36:15.840 --> 03:36:18.840]  He is a compassionate man.
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:21.840]  He is a believer in the U.S. Constitution.
[03:36:21.840 --> 03:36:24.840]  He answers only to the American people,
[03:36:24.840 --> 03:36:28.840]  not to the two-party duopoly that has run this country
[03:36:28.840 --> 03:36:36.840]  into the ground.
[03:36:36.840 --> 03:36:41.840]  And therefore, I appeal to the President,
[03:36:41.840 --> 03:36:46.840]  review this case in the name of Justice,
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:50.840]  in the name of Mercy, in the name of Fairness.
[03:36:50.840 --> 03:36:53.840]  Harden every member of the Bundy family
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:59.840]  and their supporters and do it now.
[03:36:59.840 --> 03:37:03.840]  We will be posting a petition at infowars.com
[03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:06.840]  and at stonecoldtruth.com to the President,
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:08.840]  urging him to review this case
[03:37:08.840 --> 03:37:10.840]  and in the act of mercy and justice,
[03:37:10.840 --> 03:37:13.840]  harden these patriots.
[03:37:13.840 --> 03:37:17.840]  Let's be clear.
[03:37:17.840 --> 03:37:19.840]  We will not be silenced.
[03:37:19.840 --> 03:37:21.840]  We will not be intimidated.
[03:37:21.840 --> 03:37:24.840]  We will not be censored.
[03:37:24.840 --> 03:37:28.840]  We will not go away and we will not shut up.
[03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:34.840]  We are in this fight to the end.
[03:37:34.840 --> 03:37:40.840]  Now, we know that the illegal, unconstitutional
[03:37:40.840 --> 03:37:43.840]  and outrageous actions of Judge Navarro,
[03:37:43.840 --> 03:37:47.840]  a vestige on the bench given to us by Harry Reid,
[03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:50.840]  the single most corrupt man in American political history,
[03:37:50.840 --> 03:37:55.840]  who as a Casino Control Commission
[03:37:55.840 --> 03:37:57.840]  was known as Paper Bag Harry,
[03:37:57.840 --> 03:38:00.840]  because if you gave him cash in a brown paper bag,
[03:38:00.840 --> 03:38:02.840]  you could get whatever you wanted.
[03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:04.840]  This piece of human experiment,
[03:38:04.840 --> 03:38:06.840]  posing as a human being,
[03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:10.840]  is a disgrace to his state and his country.
[03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:21.840]  Thank you.
[03:38:21.840 --> 03:38:22.840]  There you have it.
[03:38:22.840 --> 03:38:25.840]  It was my high privilege and honor
[03:38:25.840 --> 03:38:28.840]  to meet with members of the Bundy family,
[03:38:28.840 --> 03:38:31.840]  the wives, the daughters, the sisters,
[03:38:31.840 --> 03:38:34.840]  who are not incarcerated.
[03:38:34.840 --> 03:38:37.840]  These are brave Americans folks.
[03:38:37.840 --> 03:38:40.840]  The federal government is attempting to destroy them
[03:38:40.840 --> 03:38:42.840]  and their families.
[03:38:42.840 --> 03:38:44.840]  So please, do several things.
[03:38:44.840 --> 03:38:49.840]  One, pray for the Bundy's and their supporters.
[03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:58.840]  Secondarily, the White House phone number is 202-456-1414.
[03:38:58.840 --> 03:39:03.840]  That's 202-456-1414.
[03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:07.840]  If you follow the White House switchboard,
[03:39:07.840 --> 03:39:10.840]  there is a specific place where you are allowed to leave
[03:39:10.840 --> 03:39:12.840]  a message for the president.
[03:39:12.840 --> 03:39:16.840]  Call on the president as a man of justice,
[03:39:16.840 --> 03:39:21.840]  as a man of mercy, as a man of decency,
[03:39:21.840 --> 03:39:25.840]  as a man who believes in the U.S. Constitution,
[03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:29.840]  to pardon the Bundy and their supporters.
[03:39:29.840 --> 03:39:34.840]  And very specifically, to pardon Pete Pastilli,
[03:39:34.840 --> 03:39:39.840]  a journalist who is, pardon me, Pete Santilli,
[03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:43.840]  who is a journalist who has been incarcerated
[03:39:43.840 --> 03:39:46.840]  with the Bundy ranchers and the supporters
[03:39:46.840 --> 03:39:49.840]  for the simple act of asking tough questions
[03:39:49.840 --> 03:39:53.840]  about the actions of the Bureau of Land Management
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:58.840]  and an out-of-control federal bureaucracy.
[03:39:58.840 --> 03:40:02.840]  There is no greater fight in America today,
[03:40:02.840 --> 03:40:06.840]  and our president must do the right thing.
[03:40:06.840 --> 03:40:12.840]  Very disappointed in the sequence of events.
[03:40:12.840 --> 03:40:17.840]  I know many people are unhappy with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[03:40:17.840 --> 03:40:22.840]  But only weeks ago, the Attorney General visited Nevada
[03:40:22.840 --> 03:40:25.840]  where he gave an interview in which he praised
[03:40:25.840 --> 03:40:30.840]  the prosecution in the Bundy case.
[03:40:30.840 --> 03:40:36.840]  For any member of the law, for any officer of the court,
[03:40:36.840 --> 03:40:40.840]  you would know that this is inappropriate.
[03:40:40.840 --> 03:40:45.840]  For the highest law enforcement official in the United States,
[03:40:45.840 --> 03:40:50.840]  who give an opinion like that while the trial is ongoing,
[03:40:50.840 --> 03:40:55.840]  can take the outcome of the trial and can destroy
[03:40:55.840 --> 03:40:59.840]  any chance that the Bundy's have of a fair trial
[03:40:59.840 --> 03:41:03.840]  under our constitutional system.
[03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:06.840]  Please, folks, pick up the phone.
[03:41:06.840 --> 03:41:08.840]  Call the White House.
[03:41:08.840 --> 03:41:11.840]  Let the president know where you stand.
[03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:17.840]  Appeal to him on the basis of justice and mercy.
[03:41:17.840 --> 03:41:20.840]  Anything. Now, let's take up the question
[03:41:20.840 --> 03:41:23.840]  of Attorney General Sessions.
[03:41:23.840 --> 03:41:27.840]  It's interesting that those in the media
[03:41:27.840 --> 03:41:31.840]  who were aghast at Jeff Sessions' appointment,
[03:41:31.840 --> 03:41:36.840]  who were praising the selection of Rod Rosenstein,
[03:41:36.840 --> 03:41:40.840]  the Bush-Clinton-Quisling,
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:45.840]  who appointed Robert Mueller as an executioner of our president,
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:51.840]  are now, unbelievably, praising Jeff Sessions.
[03:41:51.840 --> 03:41:55.840]  Has Attorney General Sessions been compromised?
[03:41:55.840 --> 03:42:00.840]  Why has he not proceeded against the Obama front line
[03:42:00.840 --> 03:42:04.840]  of his NSA team, who were deeply involved
[03:42:04.840 --> 03:42:09.840]  in the surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans?
[03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:12.840]  It's not Alex Jones making this claim.
[03:42:12.840 --> 03:42:17.840]  It's not Roger Stone. It's not infowars.com.
[03:42:17.840 --> 03:42:20.840]  It's the U.S. FISA court.
[03:42:20.840 --> 03:42:25.840]  There is no doubt whatsoever about the legal culpability
[03:42:25.840 --> 03:42:30.840]  of Susan Rice and CIA director John Brennan
[03:42:30.840 --> 03:42:35.840]  and Admiral Roger and Valerie Jarrett.
[03:42:35.840 --> 03:42:39.840]  And, yes, Barack Obama himself
[03:42:39.840 --> 03:42:43.840]  in this wholesale wiretapping, as it were,
[03:42:43.840 --> 03:42:48.840]  of Republicans for solely political purposes.
[03:42:48.840 --> 03:42:52.840]  Now, I am a veteran of the Watergate days.
[03:42:52.840 --> 03:42:55.840]  I was working for Richard Nixon
[03:42:55.840 --> 03:43:00.840]  when he was brought down by two egregious mistakes.
[03:43:00.840 --> 03:43:05.840]  One was an attempt to find the leakers.
[03:43:05.840 --> 03:43:07.840]  Does this sound familiar?
[03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:12.840]  See, Jeff Sessions launching new probes to find the leakers
[03:43:12.840 --> 03:43:17.840]  as egregious as those leaks may be is a waste of time.
[03:43:17.840 --> 03:43:20.840]  The leakers will never be found.
[03:43:20.840 --> 03:43:23.840]  If you want to root out the leakers,
[03:43:23.840 --> 03:43:28.840]  then get the Obama holdovers in various federal departments
[03:43:28.840 --> 03:43:33.840]  who remain in place under President Trump out of office.
[03:43:33.840 --> 03:43:36.840]  That's how you plug the leaks.
[03:43:36.840 --> 03:43:39.840]  But one, it ultimately happened,
[03:43:39.840 --> 03:43:44.840]  is in our frustration to find the leakers,
[03:43:44.840 --> 03:43:50.840]  we resort to the same kind of surveillance and wiretapping
[03:43:50.840 --> 03:43:54.840]  that we're trying to uncover and prosecute.
[03:43:54.840 --> 03:43:59.840]  In short, we become as bad as they are.
[03:43:59.840 --> 03:44:04.840]  That is not the proper response.
[03:44:04.840 --> 03:44:07.840]  So, what will happen now?
[03:44:07.840 --> 03:44:11.840]  I am told from my White House sources only moments ago
[03:44:11.840 --> 03:44:15.840]  that the President believes he has sent enough signals
[03:44:15.840 --> 03:44:18.840]  to Jeff Sessions about what he wants done.
[03:44:18.840 --> 03:44:21.840]  He's waiting for action.
[03:44:21.840 --> 03:44:25.840]  He's waiting to see whether Sessions will initiate
[03:44:25.840 --> 03:44:31.840]  prosecutions against the entire Obama Frontline NSA crowd,
[03:44:31.840 --> 03:44:34.840]  as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:44:34.840 --> 03:44:41.840]  And yes, he wants Jeff Sessions to look into the fusion GPS setup
[03:44:41.840 --> 03:44:44.840]  of Donald Trump Jr.
[03:44:44.840 --> 03:44:47.840]  Why did they target Donald Trump Jr.?
[03:44:47.840 --> 03:44:52.840]  Because he is an unabashed fan of infowars.com,
[03:44:52.840 --> 03:44:56.840]  because he is unafraid to re-quit and re-post
[03:44:56.840 --> 03:45:00.840]  some of the most revealing stories that you see here at InfoWars.
[03:45:00.840 --> 03:45:03.840]  Because he is a patriot who supports his father
[03:45:03.840 --> 03:45:06.840]  and isn't afraid of a fight.
[03:45:06.840 --> 03:45:09.840]  That's why he has been targeted.
[03:45:09.840 --> 03:45:11.840]  Let's be very clear.
[03:45:11.840 --> 03:45:15.840]  It doesn't matter whether Donald Trump Jr. met with one Russian
[03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:20.840]  or 100 Russians, none of those meetings are illegal
[03:45:20.840 --> 03:45:23.840]  or improper.
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:27.840]  In a presidential campaign, and I've been in 10 of them
[03:45:27.840 --> 03:45:31.840]  from Richard Nixon to three campaigns for Governor
[03:45:31.840 --> 03:45:33.840]  and then President Ronald Reagan,
[03:45:33.840 --> 03:45:37.840]  to that great American patriot, Senator Bob Dole,
[03:45:37.840 --> 03:45:40.840]  who campaigned hard for the Trump-Pence ticket
[03:45:40.840 --> 03:45:44.840]  despite the fact that he is in his 90s,
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:48.840]  or whether it was the campaign of Donald Trump.
[03:45:48.840 --> 03:45:53.840]  When someone comes to you and says they had documented proof
[03:45:53.840 --> 03:45:57.840]  of illicit activities by your opponent,
[03:45:57.840 --> 03:46:02.840]  if you did not pursue that to determine whether it was true,
[03:46:02.840 --> 03:46:05.840]  you would be guilty of malpractice.
[03:46:05.840 --> 03:46:10.840]  You would be guilty of undermining your own campaign.
[03:46:10.840 --> 03:46:12.840]  I stress this again.
[03:46:12.840 --> 03:46:17.840]  Donald Trump Jr. has done nothing whatsoever wrong.
[03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:20.840]  Yet the media acts like he robbed a bank.
[03:46:20.840 --> 03:46:25.840]  And the media acts like there is something illegal.
[03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:29.840]  You'll notice that in the last several days,
[03:46:29.840 --> 03:46:35.840]  the entire Russian collusion delusion has disappeared
[03:46:35.840 --> 03:46:37.840]  from the mainstream media.
[03:46:37.840 --> 03:46:42.840]  Now, suddenly, all they want to talk about is Andrew Dice
[03:46:42.840 --> 03:46:44.840]  Scaramucci, as I call him,
[03:46:44.840 --> 03:46:49.840]  and the fact that he is an outspoken New Yorker
[03:46:49.840 --> 03:46:52.840]  who calls it the way he sees it,
[03:46:52.840 --> 03:46:56.840]  and that Scaramucci is sick of the leaking
[03:46:56.840 --> 03:46:59.840]  by those around the president.
[03:46:59.840 --> 03:47:03.840]  Now, I can tell you, folks, in American politics,
[03:47:03.840 --> 03:47:07.840]  the highest privilege and honor you can have
[03:47:07.840 --> 03:47:11.840]  is working for the president of the United States.
[03:47:11.840 --> 03:47:15.840]  A White House job is the epitome of success
[03:47:15.840 --> 03:47:21.840]  for those who consider themselves professional political operatives.
[03:47:21.840 --> 03:47:23.840]  And what happens?
[03:47:23.840 --> 03:47:27.840]  Those that the president bestows this high honor on,
[03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:30.840]  this privilege to work in the White House,
[03:47:30.840 --> 03:47:32.840]  turn around and leak.
[03:47:32.840 --> 03:47:34.840]  And why do they leak?
[03:47:34.840 --> 03:47:39.840]  Well, in some cases, it's to burnish their own bread,
[03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:42.840]  to aggrandize themselves,
[03:47:42.840 --> 03:47:47.840]  and to suck up to elitist, snotty, left-wing reporters
[03:47:47.840 --> 03:47:49.840]  in the mainstream media,
[03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:54.840]  not realizing that they will simply be used and discarded.
[03:47:54.840 --> 03:47:58.840]  In other cases, they leak to pursue an agenda
[03:47:58.840 --> 03:48:01.840]  that is not the president.
[03:48:01.840 --> 03:48:06.840]  So, for example, the leaks leading up to the Paris climate conflict,
[03:48:06.840 --> 03:48:11.840]  where we were told that the president's views were evolving,
[03:48:11.840 --> 03:48:16.840]  that the president was going to Europe to get smart,
[03:48:16.840 --> 03:48:24.840]  that we saw the president moving towards the European view of things,
[03:48:24.840 --> 03:48:33.840]  all designed to lull the president into signing on to the failed Paris Accord.
[03:48:33.840 --> 03:48:41.840]  A perfect example of self-aggrandizing leaks for a political agenda.
[03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:47.840]  Now, we are going into, I think, a crucial period
[03:48:47.840 --> 03:48:54.840]  in which Reince Priebus' job hangs by a literal thread.
[03:48:54.840 --> 03:48:57.840]  And the president will make a crucial decision
[03:48:57.840 --> 03:49:03.840]  hours ahead about which way his administration is going to go.
[03:49:03.840 --> 03:49:07.840]  Will he choose a nationalist?
[03:49:07.840 --> 03:49:14.840]  Will he choose someone who is dedicated to the Trump reform agenda?
[03:49:14.840 --> 03:49:20.840]  My sources tell me the president was amused by the New Yorker's story.
[03:49:20.840 --> 03:49:24.840]  He has not held it against Pierre Mucci in the slightest.
[03:49:24.840 --> 03:49:28.840]  In fact, the president enjoys Anthony Scaramucci's feistyness.
[03:49:28.840 --> 03:49:33.840]  He enjoys the fact that he's a fighter who calls it as he sees it.
[03:49:33.840 --> 03:49:37.840]  I can tell you the president was on the phone with Scaramucci yesterday
[03:49:37.840 --> 03:49:42.840]  no less than five times to talk about the latest development.
[03:49:42.840 --> 03:49:47.840]  I would not, if I were a betting man, be putting my money on Reince Priebus,
[03:49:47.840 --> 03:49:51.840]  the Cato Kalen of the Trump administration,
[03:49:51.840 --> 03:49:56.840]  the house guest who doesn't know when it's time to leave.
[03:49:56.840 --> 03:50:01.840]  We are in the final road of his removal.
[03:50:01.840 --> 03:50:08.840]  But will the president choose Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs official
[03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:13.840]  who heads his economic policy, or Dina Habib Powell,
[03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:18.840]  the globalist bushy who inserted in the White House by Ivanka Trump?
[03:50:18.840 --> 03:50:24.840]  Or will he go with a patriot like Wayne Berman or David Urban?
[03:50:24.840 --> 03:50:27.840]  Only the president knows what he will do.
[03:50:27.840 --> 03:50:32.840]  But after 40 years of being a friend of Donald Trump, here's what I know.
[03:50:32.840 --> 03:50:38.840]  When the president has all the information, when he has all the facts,
[03:50:38.840 --> 03:50:41.840]  when he knows the truth of the situation,
[03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:48.840]  he almost and ultrably will make, inevitably make the very best decision.
[03:50:48.840 --> 03:50:56.840]  My faith, my confidence, our future is in the hands of Donald Trump.
[03:50:56.840 --> 03:50:58.840]  I stand with the president.
[03:50:58.840 --> 03:51:02.840]  Infowars, listeners and viewers, don't lose the faith.
[03:51:02.840 --> 03:51:12.840]  We stand with the president.

[03:54:28.840 --> 03:54:43.840]  Hello, I'm Roger Stone, back on Infowars and the Alex Jones show.
[03:54:43.840 --> 03:54:48.840]  I can now tell you that my sources in Washington tell me
[03:54:48.840 --> 03:54:58.840]  that rights previous will be replaced by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.
[03:54:58.840 --> 03:55:02.840]  Little is known about the views of Mr. Kelly
[03:55:02.840 --> 03:55:08.840]  other than on the narrow question of the war on drugs
[03:55:08.840 --> 03:55:13.840]  in which Mr. Kelly would appear to be on the wrong side.
[03:55:13.840 --> 03:55:19.840]  But you are hearing on infowars.com long before any other major
[03:55:19.840 --> 03:55:27.840]  mainstream media outlet that Kelly will be the next White House chief of staff.
[03:55:27.840 --> 03:55:33.840]  Remember, you heard it here at Infowars first.
[03:55:33.840 --> 03:55:41.840]  I also want you to know that the campaign of Omar Navarro
[03:55:41.840 --> 03:55:48.840]  challenging Maxine waters in a district outside of Los Angeles.
[03:55:48.840 --> 03:55:54.840]  A race that was first identified by Owen Scheuer here at Infowars
[03:55:54.840 --> 03:55:59.840]  as one of the most important in the country
[03:55:59.840 --> 03:56:04.840]  is hosting a fundraiser on Monday night July 31st
[03:56:04.840 --> 03:56:09.840]  where I will be appearing with Mr. Navarro
[03:56:09.840 --> 03:56:14.840]  who I believe is one of the most dynamic and exciting young candidates
[03:56:14.840 --> 03:56:17.840]  for Congress that I have ever met.
[03:56:17.840 --> 03:56:22.840]  Omar Navarro reminds me of a young, hungry Richard Nixon
[03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:28.840]  and he is going to take down Maxine waters in a very difficult fight
[03:56:28.840 --> 03:56:31.840]  an uphill fight in the Democratic district.
[03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:35.840]  But you see folks, the issue is not left right.
[03:56:35.840 --> 03:56:40.840]  The issue is not liberal versus conservative or Republican versus Democrat
[03:56:40.840 --> 03:56:46.840]  because Maxine waters is one of the most corrupt members of the U.S. Congress.
[03:56:46.840 --> 03:56:53.840]  Maxine waters used her influence to push the federal government to bail out a bank
[03:56:53.840 --> 03:56:58.840]  but never revealed that she and her husband are shareholders in that bank
[03:56:58.840 --> 03:57:04.840]  or their husband was on the board of the bank.
[03:57:04.840 --> 03:57:12.840]  Maxine waters campaign paid her daughter $600,000.
[03:57:12.840 --> 03:57:17.840]  For what? This is corruption.
[03:57:17.840 --> 03:57:24.840]  So, folks, come out and support us on Monday night
[03:57:24.840 --> 03:57:29.840]  the 31st at the Trump National Golf Club
[03:57:29.840 --> 03:57:34.840]  in Rancho Calas Verdes, then call for Omar Navarro,
[03:57:34.840 --> 03:57:38.840]  the candidate first identified by Owen Scheuer.
[03:57:38.840 --> 03:57:43.840]  And yes, I'm ready to announce that I will be a strategic consultant
[03:57:43.840 --> 03:57:48.840]  to his campaign, paid the princely sum of $1
[03:57:48.840 --> 03:57:54.840]  to help this fine, liberty-oriented young American be one of the worst,
[03:57:54.840 --> 03:58:00.840]  most liberal, most corrupt Trump haters in the United States Congress.
[03:58:00.840 --> 03:58:08.840]  Show up at the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles in Rancho Calas Verdes, California.
[03:58:08.840 --> 03:58:12.840]  I'll see you there. We need your support.
[03:58:12.840 --> 03:58:19.840]  And folks, go to the Infowars.com store where you can find
[03:58:19.840 --> 03:58:27.840]  the Infowars, Life, Biomy Defense, Probiotic at 20% off.

[03:58:40.840 --> 03:58:49.840]  God bless you, God bless America, and victory or death.
