[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:40.840]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are live it is the first day of
[00:40.840 --> 00:48.520]  November 2011 this year that has basically come in so quickly is about to
[00:48.520 --> 00:55.280]  go out even faster amazing and then we enter 2012 the New Age doomsday system I
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.040]  predict will still be here when we hit 2013 but it is going to be an insane
[01:01.040 --> 01:08.160]  time undoubtedly by the way when I was with Ventura last week with this TV
[01:08.160 --> 01:11.560]  show I can't get into a lot of the TV show but some amazing stuff was
[01:11.560 --> 01:17.560]  discovered but he is going to be joining us tomorrow at 12 o'clock on high noon
[01:17.560 --> 01:25.200]  second hour he will be joining us to break down the TSA his view on occupy
[01:25.200 --> 01:29.480]  Wall Street and a lot more and let me tell you the gov is wound up when he
[01:29.480 --> 01:33.520]  learned that they don't have TSA checkpoints on the highways he got pretty
[01:33.520 --> 01:38.840]  upset because he really doesn't like having his genitals grabbed I don't
[01:38.840 --> 01:46.600]  either by potbellied perf types and he's really enjoying for driving around his
[01:46.600 --> 01:50.640]  RV and avoiding these people and then when I told him that it was kind of like
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.160]  I told him a relative had died or something but after he saw the proof he
[01:54.160 --> 01:59.320]  got pretty upset I think about Ventura folks you can love him or hating but
[01:59.320 --> 02:05.400]  from all the people I've met he is so real he's really just kind of a Minnesota
[02:05.400 --> 02:11.400]  hillbilly he's a great guy and his his political awakening is really
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.440]  accelerating in fact a few times we were talking about Operation Phoenix and
[02:16.440 --> 02:23.880]  Bob Kerry the senator because we were bringing up Colonel Alexander and
[02:23.880 --> 02:29.760]  talking about him I don't want to get into too much but the point is that I
[02:29.760 --> 02:37.480]  was saying yeah I wasn't Alexander involved in me lie and he's like no it's
[02:37.480 --> 02:47.200]  Phoenix and then I was getting that confused with with Bob Kerry point is
[02:47.200 --> 02:52.240]  Ventura really knows this stuff I mean now that guy probably reads a book every
[02:52.240 --> 02:58.520]  couple days big thick political tomes I mean he's really into it is my point
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.480]  you know he'd be sitting there waiting for us to go to an interview with
[03:03.480 --> 03:07.600]  somebody or go to another location where we were investigating things and
[03:07.600 --> 03:13.560]  he'd be reading stuff he just really a character and well Ventura is joining us
[03:13.560 --> 03:18.400]  tomorrow and then I'm bad about calling and booking guests myself and then
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.840]  Jaren's always like look you said you want to get these guests on call them so
[03:22.840 --> 03:28.560]  I called Dave mustang and I waited till about ten minutes for airtime and I
[03:28.560 --> 03:33.960]  called Dave up and he was gonna come to town a few weeks ago but he's gonna come
[03:33.960 --> 03:38.520]  later because he's got to go do his South American tours new album comes out
[03:38.520 --> 03:42.520]  today and I called and woke up Dave mustang I said you're not asleep no but
[03:42.520 --> 03:47.280]  kind of I did Jimmy Kimmel last night yeah no I want to come on your show sure
[03:47.280 --> 03:53.700]  I was like well great and then I had this image of MTV's documentary about Dave
[03:53.700 --> 03:57.920]  mustang about you don't want to wake him up of course I think that was back on
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.080]  the old days the legendary legendary temper reportedly he had all of
[04:03.080 --> 04:08.520]  Metallica scared of him but I think he has he is certainly certainly mellowed
[04:08.520 --> 04:12.760]  over the years but it was funny Jaren's like I'm driving in late because they
[04:12.760 --> 04:17.240]  had wrecks and everything else out there and I get ready at home I was
[04:17.240 --> 04:22.800]  driving in to the broadcast command center this morning and it's against
[04:22.800 --> 04:26.200]  about 15 tell I'm late I'm almost here and Jaren's like well you better call
[04:26.200 --> 04:30.040]  him if you want to get him on he's about to go on his tour I guess Jaren saw
[04:30.040 --> 04:34.080]  that in the news or something and I said well I don't want to wake him up I'm
[04:34.080 --> 04:38.640]  like well I guess he's in San Diego it's it's it's like it's like 845 I'll
[04:38.640 --> 04:43.800]  call him all that's going through my mind is don't be asleep it's just funny
[04:43.800 --> 04:51.680]  if you're a Dave mustang fan going way back okay that's not the news I'll

[08:12.920 --> 08:20.400]  Tuesday November 1st 2011 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours and
[08:20.400 --> 08:24.440]  after I go over a smattering of what I believe is the most important news and
[08:24.440 --> 08:29.000]  information we will open the phones up and go to your calls no guest today I
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.960]  could have a guest but I told the producers that let's just leave the
[08:33.960 --> 08:39.320]  decks clear so that I can cover a lot of news get to a lot of different news
[08:39.320 --> 08:45.680]  clips that I want to analyze today and a lot more we do have Jesse Ventura with
[08:45.680 --> 08:51.120]  breaking news joining us tomorrow in the second hour and I'm gonna probably get
[08:51.120 --> 08:55.800]  Dave Mustaine on sometime this week via telephone I was wanting to get it when
[08:55.800 --> 09:00.000]  he came to Austin but that's gonna come up in a few months or so but Dave
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.680]  Mustaine's new album with Megadeth coming out today and again Liberty
[09:04.680 --> 09:10.440]  oriented exposing the New World Order a style like his last hit album Endgame
[09:10.440 --> 09:16.840]  named after of course I'm very honored my seminal film Endgame blueprint for
[09:16.840 --> 09:22.480]  global enslavement okay here is just some of the news we're gonna be getting
[09:22.480 --> 09:28.520]  at big developments with China and the G20 and China now being the lender and
[09:28.520 --> 09:33.240]  the holder of not just US debt but Euro debt all of this has been finagled
[09:33.240 --> 09:37.160]  and maneuvered by the globalist they bragged about it in the 80s how this
[09:37.160 --> 09:40.920]  century would be the Chinese government century because they want to use that
[09:40.920 --> 09:44.920]  collectivist model to leverage out all their global competition it's the
[09:44.920 --> 09:49.240]  communist Chinese elite teamed up with the robber barons to basically
[09:49.240 --> 09:53.200]  globally consolidate all industrial development on this planet and
[09:53.200 --> 09:59.200]  deindustrialize the West so we have that report Greece is saying hey you think
[09:59.200 --> 10:03.240]  you've just passed this Euro expansion banker takeover for five trillion
[10:03.240 --> 10:08.200]  leveraged off a hundred billion dollar debt of Greece yeah nothing to do with
[10:08.200 --> 10:12.240]  Greece is just an excuse to for a power grab we're gonna have a referendum on
[10:12.240 --> 10:17.360]  this our people are gonna be allowed to vote every other EU country except for
[10:17.360 --> 10:22.160]  what two nations Ireland and one other have not even been allowed to vote on
[10:22.160 --> 10:26.720]  entry to the EU because the vast majority are against it over 80% in
[10:26.720 --> 10:30.440]  major polls in England but they're not allowed to vote David Cameron said of
[10:30.440 --> 10:35.640]  course two weeks ago that he's gonna block a vote in the UK on the people of
[10:35.640 --> 10:44.120]  the UK Northern Ireland England Scotland Wales being able to vote being able to
[10:44.120 --> 10:48.320]  vote on not just being in the Euro which they've been sucked into
[10:48.320 --> 10:53.600]  unconstitutionally without a vote but on the expansion of its powers this huge
[10:53.600 --> 10:59.240]  new power grab so that's all in a big tailspin right now and causing the
[10:59.240 --> 11:02.760]  European stock market to go down a lot of other craziness which is the exact
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.600]  type of volatility the central banks like and I think it's all just a stunt
[11:07.600 --> 11:11.320]  clearly they've had a lot of election fraud going on in Greece or all those
[11:11.320 --> 11:15.120]  Goldman Sachs executives wouldn't be staying in office over there with this
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.720]  long-term scam they set up so that's coming up of the telegraphs reporting
[11:19.720 --> 11:24.120]  something that DNA studies have shown from bones that have been tested from
[11:24.120 --> 11:30.240]  Neanderthal with regular homo sapiens sapien bones and that is that Siberians
[11:30.240 --> 11:35.720]  share DNA with extinct human species will so do northern Europeans I mean you
[11:35.720 --> 11:39.880]  check out my brow ridge ladies and gentlemen but the point is is that it's
[11:39.880 --> 11:43.600]  really from the deeper studies that have been out now for about five years with
[11:43.600 --> 11:48.720]  multiple universities we cover it every few months studying DNA is that it
[11:48.720 --> 11:55.560]  really wasn't a different species it was just a different variety kind of like
[11:55.560 --> 12:01.320]  I've got gray and black rock squirrels at my house that can breed with brown
[12:01.320 --> 12:08.560]  squirrels it's just a variety a variety of squirrel and so this is really just a
[12:08.560 --> 12:14.920]  lot of us spin but it is interesting and no doubt that I'm proud to be part
[12:14.920 --> 12:19.320]  Neanderthal folks and they reportedly had more intelligence advanced
[12:19.320 --> 12:26.680]  intelligence so that is I mean there are quote differences in every group every
[12:26.680 --> 12:33.120]  every group has quote on average gifts that other group of humans don't have
[12:33.120 --> 12:38.200]  but then within any group you're gonna have people who excel even more than
[12:38.200 --> 12:43.280]  others in groups that quote have those special gifts so we're all diverse we're
[12:43.280 --> 12:50.440]  also extremely similar we all bleed red blood but northern Europeans and
[12:50.440 --> 12:55.880]  Siberians are a little bit different and reportedly they've been doing testing
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.640]  on Japanese and other more northern Asians and of course you pat cross the
[13:01.640 --> 13:08.160]  Bering Strait into the Americas quite a long time ago and they've now found
[13:08.160 --> 13:13.720]  Nordic blood in them well no kidding they've dug up Vikings all over all
[13:13.720 --> 13:18.600]  over North America all over Newfoundland all over Canada all over Minnesota this
[13:18.600 --> 13:23.600]  is well known with archaeologists and anthropologists but not really advertised
[13:23.600 --> 13:30.680]  so when you see a Native American they've got Neanderthal which is just an
[13:30.680 --> 13:36.280]  ancient northern European group an Ice Age man
[13:36.280 --> 13:39.720]  you know just certain types were able to live and survive so you got a certain
[13:39.720 --> 13:46.240]  look and then you've of course have got there were predominantly meat eaters
[13:46.240 --> 13:49.760]  that's why they would dig up the skeletons of dead Neanderthal that
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.040]  think these guys were hunchback these guys were hunched over no they were
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.440]  killing large animals all day and attacking Willie mammoth mastodon
[13:59.440 --> 14:08.760]  saber-toothed cats giant cave bears now extinct giant lions that were also
[14:08.760 --> 14:13.640]  extinct Ice Age lions they've gotten into all those caves and France and
[14:13.640 --> 14:17.560]  things with the in the Neanderthal that reportedly invented art and so much
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.280]  more and they've got 40,000 year old caves that are just unbelievable in
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.880]  fact I saw a documentary about it with Herzog's last film just amazing cave of
[14:26.880 --> 14:31.120]  dreams forgotten dreams very powerful and at the end of the film you know they
[14:31.120 --> 14:37.480]  described why the Neanderthals did this is they they wanted to communicate with
[14:37.480 --> 14:42.960]  the future their love of humanity and that is the most sincere human trait is
[14:42.960 --> 14:47.800]  the need to build up the species and survive and it's been a lot of
[14:47.800 --> 14:54.040]  archaeologists and paleo anthropologists believe and it shows that the Ice Age was
[14:54.040 --> 14:59.360]  such an incredible stressor for Ice Age man that that's what brought their
[14:59.360 --> 15:05.320]  technologies to the next level was because of how dangerous it was but
[15:05.320 --> 15:09.120]  I'm gonna I'm now digressing I you're tuning in to hear about news and
[15:09.120 --> 15:19.600]  information but a toast to the Neanderthals all right continuing and
[15:19.600 --> 15:24.880]  they've dug up Neanderthal all over all over Russia all over Spain Germany
[15:24.880 --> 15:31.960]  France up into more than northern clines interesting article will be getting
[15:31.960 --> 15:38.320]  into some of that hey have you ever walked out of a store and and and you
[15:38.320 --> 15:42.440]  got a sandwich at the deli or something sort of eating it or or maybe a chocolate
[15:42.440 --> 15:46.000]  milk you saw in the counter and you grabbed it and then you get up there
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.280]  and the lady forgets to check it out and then you go out through the doors
[15:50.280 --> 15:57.440]  stores are now calling it zero tolerance even if you did it on accident and you
[15:57.440 --> 16:03.920]  went through and paid for $500 of food but forgot a milk or something or or an
[16:03.920 --> 16:11.000]  iced tea you bought out of one of their in-cap areas you will now go to jail in
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.920]  fact I've seen reports or people even try to bring stuff back and point out oh
[16:15.920 --> 16:19.080]  I forgot to pay for this and they still go well it doesn't matter security but
[16:19.080 --> 16:23.120]  wait I came to pay for it it doesn't matter you're going to jail again they
[16:23.120 --> 16:28.400]  say it's corporate policy it's corporate policy that we card a 80 year old woman
[16:28.400 --> 16:37.880]  on a walker I have seen a woman on a cane who looked like she was not far
[16:37.880 --> 16:44.000]  from the grave being one time I saw one at Walgreens buying pipe tobacco for her
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.840]  husband I asked her do you smoke a pipe and she said no it's for my husband
[16:46.840 --> 16:52.320]  he's bedridden smokes his pipe that was years ago I've seen old women try to buy
[16:52.320 --> 16:55.800]  six pack of beer being carted and when they ask for the card it's about
[16:55.800 --> 17:00.600]  mindlessness it's about you're not allowed to make your own decision as a
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.320]  teller and it's getting everybody ready for the cashless society but going back
[17:05.320 --> 17:13.040]  because I didn't finish a point the reason the Neanderthal worm had so many
[17:13.040 --> 17:17.240]  fractures and so many broken bones and were so debilitated was because all
[17:17.240 --> 17:22.480]  they did every day their dial is probably they estimate around 90% meat
[17:22.480 --> 17:28.120]  that's all there was except in that tiny little springtime and summer that they
[17:28.120 --> 17:32.920]  were jumping on the backs of bison they were jumping on the backs of animals
[17:32.920 --> 17:40.120]  they were they were you know running out in placements and you know jabbing
[17:40.120 --> 17:46.400]  spears into the chest of large animals trying to get that meat and and being
[17:46.400 --> 17:53.960]  thrown like bucking Bronco veteran rodeo riders and they looked at the
[17:53.960 --> 18:00.080]  skeletons in X-rays of veteran rodeo riders on different history channel
[18:00.080 --> 18:03.200]  stories I've seen that are excellent and compared it to the Neanderthal bones
[18:03.200 --> 18:07.480]  it's identical so that's why you have this image the Neanderthal hunched over
[18:07.480 --> 18:11.320]  because in the individuals the adult individuals who were dead they had just
[18:11.320 --> 18:14.640]  broken every bone in their body repeatedly so that's basically what was
[18:14.640 --> 18:18.600]  going on within the Neanderthal okay now I digress back into why I raised that
[18:18.600 --> 18:26.200]  other point a pregnant mom says sandwich arrest was horrifying mother with no
[18:26.200 --> 18:32.960]  criminal record went through bought groceries and ate the sandwich that you
[18:32.960 --> 18:40.000]  pay for but the front and forgot about it and they were handcuffed searched then
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.440]  released with $50 bail each there were a deal at the police station lasted a few
[18:44.440 --> 18:48.960]  hours but their daughter spent the night away from her parents in case that
[18:48.960 --> 18:53.520]  a spark nationwide outrage and forced the Safeway supermarket chain to review
[18:53.520 --> 18:58.120]  the incident the family to move to an apartment near downtown Honolulu from
[18:58.120 --> 19:02.680]  California two weeks ago still settling in they ventured out Wednesday to
[19:02.680 --> 19:06.120]  stock up on groceries took a bus got lost ended up the Safeway supermarket
[19:06.120 --> 19:11.320]  famished the former Air Force Staff Sergeant picked up two sandwiches that
[19:11.320 --> 19:16.560]  together cost $5 she opened openly munched on one while shopping saving
[19:16.560 --> 19:20.400]  the rapper to be scammed the register I've actually done this and then walked
[19:20.400 --> 19:24.720]  back in and paid once I was halfway down the road when they forgot to pay for
[19:24.720 --> 19:29.880]  the sandwiches as they checked out with the $50 worth of groceries with a
[19:29.880 --> 19:32.800]  security guard question this I was really embarrassed I was horrified she said
[19:32.800 --> 19:36.800]  they were let upstairs with a couple expected to get a lecture pay for the
[19:36.800 --> 19:41.280]  sandwiches and be allowed to go on their way but instead they said zero
[19:41.280 --> 19:48.000]  tolerance and took them to jail and then of course CPS then took the child they
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.720]  called child welfare services and took the child of course CPS then tried to
[19:52.720 --> 19:58.080]  keep the child and that created this is what it's all about spiders spin webs to
[19:58.080 --> 20:02.000]  catch food the government sees us as their food is that so many people suffer
[20:02.000 --> 20:06.280]  from so many illnesses today why don't doctors know how to help you could it be
[20:06.280 --> 20:09.800]  that our doctors don't know how because there's a nutrition solution and they

[25:48.600 --> 25:52.760]  and unhappy or you're gonna serve your community and be involved in the side
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.000]  of good and then you're not gonna care that you get old and you get wrinkles
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.920]  and your hair falls out because you've got a mission to help build up the young
[25:59.920 --> 26:05.320]  and build up society and invent things and be passionate and stand up for the
[26:05.320 --> 26:09.720]  truth and that's what is fulfilling not the things of this world the
[26:09.720 --> 26:14.120]  artificial things were sold okay I kind of digressed often in the Anders Hall
[26:14.120 --> 26:20.760]  talk and you know the people being arrested because they forgot to pay for
[26:20.760 --> 26:25.080]  the sandwich and I'm telling you I've probably done that 15 times where I am
[26:25.080 --> 26:29.960]  grocery shopping and they've got sandwiches and I eat one especially my
[26:29.960 --> 26:32.920]  wife sends me with the kids when she's busy and I've got three of them and I'm
[26:32.920 --> 26:38.280]  grocery shopping sometimes and I will routinely you know get a water get a get
[26:38.280 --> 26:44.240]  an orange juice get a sandwich or they want some raisins and about 80% of the
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.480]  time I end up paying for it but repeatedly I go out the door and then
[26:48.480 --> 26:53.640]  turn right back around and get back in line and pay for it or more often than
[26:53.640 --> 26:56.760]  not I forget stuff I need to go up and pay for stuff that but go back in and
[26:56.760 --> 27:02.800]  get it and go back out but now that doesn't just get you landed in jail the
[27:02.800 --> 27:08.040]  CPS comes and prays and takes your children doesn't matter when the cops run
[27:08.040 --> 27:12.320]  your thing you have no criminal background you're a Air Force Staff
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.840]  Sergeant working for the system doesn't matter we're taking your kids and we're
[27:16.840 --> 27:21.600]  going to try to keep them we're going to terrorize you because we're a predator
[27:21.600 --> 27:27.080]  government by the way speaking of that you know Louisiana has come out and
[27:27.080 --> 27:31.000]  announced they're not going to allow cash for secondhand sales swap meets
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.640]  garage sales or can't pay for cash get a lawn mower place at selling use lawn
[27:35.640 --> 27:40.640]  mowers and you'll serve felony jail time they have a new spy force doing it
[27:40.640 --> 27:45.680]  cops coming in trying to buy the lawn mower or whatever or again it treats
[27:45.680 --> 27:50.640]  us all as if we're guilty until put in the slammer not until proven innocent
[27:50.640 --> 27:55.840]  guilty until fed on by vampires guilty until overrun and trampled by
[27:55.840 --> 28:01.080]  parasitic corrupt oppressive authoritarian bamboozling con artist
[28:01.080 --> 28:06.160]  criminal parasitical government but that's not enough Louisiana Supreme
[28:06.160 --> 28:10.200]  Court allows vehicle searches on a hunch and later if we have time I'll play the
[28:10.200 --> 28:14.040]  newscast they go that's right officers no longer need probable cause which is
[28:14.040 --> 28:17.080]  like somebody banging on the back of the car saying help me in the trunk or
[28:17.080 --> 28:21.880]  blood on the seat and the guy's got a scratch on his face and acting paranoid
[28:21.880 --> 28:28.160]  or smelling the marijuana now I just think there might be well a hunch
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.920]  doesn't do it in common law but hey who needs that who needs any of this let's
[28:32.920 --> 28:36.800]  get rid of it all after all-time magazine and Newsweek say the problems the
[28:36.800 --> 28:40.280]  Constitution you notice as we get rid of the Constitution everything goes to
[28:40.280 --> 28:46.920]  hell in a handbasket but the answer is we didn't get rid of enough of it so
[28:46.920 --> 28:52.040]  Louisiana Supreme Court allows vehicle searches on a hunch talking on a cell
[28:52.040 --> 28:56.240]  phone or entering and texting another car a sufficient justification for a
[28:56.240 --> 28:59.400]  warrant will search Louisiana and they say they'll actually download your
[28:59.400 --> 29:03.480]  contents of your phone just like TSA does now Louisiana Supreme Court allows
[29:03.480 --> 29:08.120]  vehicle searches on a hunch and this has been out for a few months but now
[29:08.120 --> 29:11.920]  they're starting it and they just set up checkpoints we're searching everybody
[29:11.920 --> 29:16.800]  we got a hunch there's something illegal in 300 cars backed up oh and look
[29:16.800 --> 29:21.880]  who's helping TSAs here they're gonna help us now now I haven't even gotten to
[29:21.880 --> 29:27.600]  the big news yet US Fears coordinated uncordinated Israeli strike on Iran
[29:27.600 --> 29:35.880]  that's out of Ynet News out of Israel we got more reports of Al Qaeda targets

[29:39.640 --> 29:44.880]  millions of dollars by NATO in the US just north of there and so of course

[33:47.640 --> 33:53.080]  criminal the Oklahoma City cover-up artist you name it he is up there oh
[33:53.080 --> 33:55.760]  yeah we have his emails from Oklahoma City saying we got to cover this up

[34:00.960 --> 34:08.160]  he never knew that the DOJ chief under him knew and never told him about gun
[34:08.160 --> 34:13.440]  walker and operation fast and furious here's the problem and by the way get
[34:13.440 --> 34:16.160]  me Paul Watson online I'm gonna have him write an article right now get him
[34:16.160 --> 34:19.400]  online I want to talk to him on air please be answers thank you I need to
[34:19.400 --> 34:25.200]  give him directions right now we happen to have the press releases and the
[34:25.200 --> 34:32.240]  speeches of Holder when he gave speeches about the program releasing and
[34:32.240 --> 34:39.360]  tracking guns to Mexico almost two years ago last week on the news we on the
[34:39.360 --> 34:44.640]  infowars nightly news we showed Napolitano last week testifying that she
[34:44.640 --> 34:51.360]  had never heard of any gun walking program or fast and furious then we
[34:51.360 --> 34:56.960]  cut to a press conference in 2009 with her they're talking about fast and
[34:56.960 --> 35:01.360]  furious and operation gun runner and what they were doing they are red-handed
[35:01.360 --> 35:06.360]  caught perjuring themselves and now they're perjuring themselves again in
[35:06.360 --> 35:11.000]  front of Congress and I doubt anything will be done you know why because as I
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.280]  told you from the federal documents in the Sinaloa drug cartel trial in
[35:15.280 --> 35:20.040]  Chicago we've known for a very long time that and the because the government
[35:20.040 --> 35:24.200]  announced national security and said yes it's true that cocaine is allowed to be
[35:24.200 --> 35:30.200]  shipped in by the time every month and guns are shipped into them by the ATF by
[35:30.200 --> 35:37.960]  the DEA FBI border patrol and several other agencies Coast Guard they are all
[35:37.960 --> 35:42.560]  as dirty as it gets does that mean your son or daughter in the Coast Guard's
[35:42.560 --> 35:47.360]  bad no they're out there you know going after citizens you catch a fish one it
[35:47.360 --> 35:50.400]  shorter than it's supposed to be and throwing the book at them there they're
[35:50.400 --> 35:54.320]  out there you know patrolling around and the citizens are all cowering and fear
[35:54.320 --> 35:58.000]  I'm sorry I've seen it that's what this country is about now I'm not saying that
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.760]  the Coast Guard doesn't do some good work my point is at the top these agencies
[36:01.760 --> 36:07.960]  are run by narcotics trafficking gun-running mafias and the nightmare
[36:07.960 --> 36:11.440]  is only going to get worse as long as we're naive and what it is to say two
[36:11.440 --> 36:14.560]  weeks ago he said oh by the way in this investigation it's going to come out
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.240]  Bush was running a similar program what a different name the exact same stinking
[36:19.240 --> 36:24.920]  thing they've they've never gotten rid of any of this and and it makes me so
[36:24.920 --> 36:29.760]  angry during the break they didn't put it on screen while Paul's talking it's
[36:29.760 --> 36:33.480]  got him testifying that he didn't know first they said none of the Justice
[36:33.480 --> 36:36.680]  Department knew and that they didn't give the orders to the ATF and now that's
[36:36.680 --> 36:39.800]  all come out to be a lie and now it's come out the White House was ordering it
[36:39.800 --> 36:43.840]  all of course the White House was ordering it all they did was then
[36:43.840 --> 36:48.440]  blaming on the Second Amendment something Bush or Clinton never did it goes
[36:48.440 --> 36:53.000]  back to Iran Contra it goes back before that this government has always armed
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.040]  certain rebels and certain groups that attack the other groups that are
[36:57.040 --> 37:04.320]  growing drugs to control the flow of it 500 billion dollars a year coming in to
[37:04.320 --> 37:14.120]  the United States 500 billion dollars a year of course the government and the
[37:14.120 --> 37:18.520]  big banks are involved of course there's clandestine armies being funded to try
[37:18.520 --> 37:23.640]  to control it I mean are you you think crack houses are hiding 500 million
[37:23.640 --> 37:27.940]  dollars you think these stupid idiots are robbing around with gold rims making
[37:27.940 --> 37:31.480]  chicken feet off drug sales of the people keeping the cash and they get
[37:31.480 --> 37:35.120]  any of this is hit the government made the stinking drugs illegal so that they
[37:35.120 --> 37:40.080]  could jack up the stinking prices and so all the crackheads and meth heads and
[37:40.080 --> 37:43.680]  every all the rest of them I'll break into your house and business to then go
[37:43.680 --> 37:48.500]  pay their taxes to the bankers when they buy the drugs it's another tax to the
[37:48.500 --> 37:52.760]  New World Order and I'm sick of it and I'm tired of it I don't like the drug
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.920]  users who use the prescription hardcore drugs or the illegal ones any of it
[37:57.920 --> 38:03.280]  you're all being conned kids never use it the first time never get on it and
[38:03.280 --> 38:09.000]  I'm talking about caffeine alcohol you name it it's all bad news a lot of you
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.720]  could do it in moderation alcohol or caffeine or whatever but a lot of us
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.060]  can't the point is is that this is how modern slavery works they put
[38:17.060 --> 38:22.280]  chemicals out that they know people want and then when you use the chemicals
[38:22.280 --> 38:26.240]  and get addicted they put you in a prison owned by banks that launder the
[38:26.240 --> 38:33.200]  drug money and I've had enough of it man I tell you DOJ official new of ATF
[38:33.200 --> 38:39.440]  gun walking in April 2010 bring up Paul Watson please Paul yeah I know you've

[38:53.240 --> 38:58.400]  Defense Authorization Act preparing for a organized U.S. citizen resistance
[38:58.400 --> 39:03.840]  including a leadership of governors against a federal takeover again this
[39:03.840 --> 39:07.920]  whole system is set up to fight the American people in the States homeland
[39:07.920 --> 39:12.640]  security use the occupation force of the bankers and Paul's actually got that in
[39:12.640 --> 39:19.880]  the bottom of his article and Hale drudge for doing such a great job just use
[39:19.880 --> 39:27.840]  the Norse term skull to drudge you could use the term hip hip hooray want to use
[39:27.840 --> 39:34.640]  the 1920s colloquialism Bravo I guess Bravo is that Latin is that Spanish I
[39:34.640 --> 39:39.520]  don't know good job the point is is good job to drudge report calm getting the
[39:39.520 --> 39:43.200]  sound to so many millions more federally funded street lights cable of
[39:43.200 --> 39:49.760]  recording conversations we told you this 12 years ago it's in my film 13
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.400]  years ago it's in my film police day 2000 but but the news that we covered was
[39:53.400 --> 39:58.360]  in 1998 they call them gunshot detectors and intelligent street lights they
[39:58.360 --> 40:02.240]  listen to you they record you Austin's got them everywhere the average sheep
[40:02.240 --> 40:05.840]  will don't even know her care but now the feds are announcing they are well
[40:05.840 --> 40:11.320]  in intelligent streets systems now being installed in major cities rogue
[40:11.320 --> 40:15.560]  website bill runs into more opposition AFP we're gonna get into all of it but
[40:15.560 --> 40:23.960]  the reason I brought Paul up right now is I went into anger mode I went into
[40:23.960 --> 40:29.320]  anger mode when I saw during the break Holder saying he never knew and his
[40:29.320 --> 40:34.120]  deputy knew it in telling when Holder and I know Paul you can pull up the just
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.840]  just type in something like Holder gave press conference on gun run air in 2009
[40:38.840 --> 40:44.480]  2010 we have the video that I heard the nightly news last week we gave it the
[40:44.480 --> 40:47.960]  headline it's on YouTube now Paul and fade him down so I go to him just for
[40:47.960 --> 40:56.040]  seconds or some background noise thanks hey guys just just pop what Paul down
[40:56.040 --> 41:01.000]  for a minute cuz I'm not gonna go to him yet okay thank you going back to what
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.360]  I was saying here because this is important for everybody to understand
[41:04.360 --> 41:10.080]  who's out there okay this is why this is so key and so frustrating these are
[41:10.080 --> 41:18.720]  criminals out in the open right in front of us doing this to us okay 100%
[41:18.720 --> 41:25.960]  last week we showed Janet de Paulitano at a press conference in 2009 we're gonna
[41:25.960 --> 41:34.240]  show it again next hour saying and up there with her deputy attorney general
[41:34.240 --> 41:39.040]  up there talking about the gun runner vast and furious program then we cut to
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.840]  her last week in testimony saying she'd never heard of such a plan 100% pure
[41:44.840 --> 41:49.000]  perjury and the Republican leadership knows this but doesn't want to cover it
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.200]  because Bush is involved as well under the same program different name okay
[41:54.200 --> 41:58.440]  that's what's going on here just a political scoring we could destroy this
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.240]  corrupt political system with this and open up their entire mafia operation
[42:02.240 --> 42:06.520]  with this this is literally the sort of Damocles hanging over their chicken
[42:06.520 --> 42:12.920]  neck okay these are larceness scumbag trash criminals who will rob everything
[42:12.920 --> 42:17.720]  and rob the pension funds and launch World War three and destroy us if we
[42:17.720 --> 42:22.160]  don't bring them to justice enough is enough for all of you deniers out there
[42:22.160 --> 42:26.080]  for all of you people out there that won't wake up doubt criminal this out of
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.120]  control bureaucracy is and the special interest that put it in power it's time
[42:30.120 --> 42:34.760]  to stop living in fantasy land on fantasy island it's time to live in the
[42:34.760 --> 42:38.760]  real world or we don't have any future look at your children and ask yourself
[42:38.760 --> 42:43.480]  will you grow up and face the facts and and realize how much trouble we're in or
[42:43.480 --> 42:47.200]  will you keep sucking your thumb and destroy our future okay I'm not gonna
[42:47.200 --> 42:52.080]  get mad I just am sick of these crooks man and I don't like having to risk my
[42:52.080 --> 42:57.200]  life to fight them and my everything but I've got to do it I need more you to
[42:57.200 --> 43:05.560]  stand up and more of you take a deep breath I need more you to stand up get
[43:05.560 --> 43:10.440]  involved and to wake up so that we can all move against these people because
[43:10.440 --> 43:14.160]  here's the danger point all their criminality is coming out now and if we
[43:14.160 --> 43:19.080]  don't start exposing their criminality now and and really driving for real
[43:19.080 --> 43:23.480]  justice all of this corruption coming out of they get away with it will just
[43:23.480 --> 43:26.960]  set the precedent for more and more evil to be accepted kind of like they
[43:26.960 --> 43:30.640]  admittedly grow the opium in Afghanistan with our US troops guarding it and ship
[43:30.640 --> 43:33.840]  it out but then there's no investigation or discussion they just throw it in our
[43:33.840 --> 43:42.440]  face that they're doing it okay we have them we have Napolitano engaged in
[43:42.440 --> 43:47.880]  perjury on video caught it's public the White House ran this and went one
[43:47.880 --> 43:53.720]  further than the predecessors not just arming drug gangs to control the drug
[43:53.720 --> 43:59.640]  market and to jack up prices but actually then blaming the Second Amendment for
[43:59.640 --> 44:02.720]  the total destabilization and now I've seen numbers I've been corrected it's
[44:02.720 --> 44:06.960]  not 40,000 dead that's mainstream media numbers here in three years in Mexico
[44:06.960 --> 44:13.680]  it's 60,000 dead the Mexican major TV is reporting 60,000 dead I mean if you
[44:13.680 --> 44:17.200]  stop for a layover as a stewardess in Mexico sitting now you got a good
[44:17.200 --> 44:19.840]  chance of being killed in your hotel room I saw that yesterday I mean it's
[44:19.840 --> 44:28.160]  just total hell genocide implosion sinking into the ocean just war zone
[44:28.160 --> 44:32.440]  and it's all over the drugs being illegal and now it's spilling into the US
[44:32.440 --> 44:36.840]  I'm going to Paul I'm going to Paul here but Paul I need you I know we put out
[44:36.840 --> 44:39.280]  reports on this but we need to really throw down the gauntlet you know a
[44:39.280 --> 44:46.080]  total proof just department lying you know caught perjury we need to put it
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.680]  out need to get the YouTube report that's up there on on our YouTube from
[44:50.680 --> 44:54.440]  our nightly news last week where we or it's at presentplanet.tv where it's
[44:54.440 --> 45:01.200]  called the Palatano cotton perjury I'm gonna play it again next hour but the
[45:01.200 --> 45:05.960]  point is we have her lying we have Holder traveling around an 09 and 010
[45:05.960 --> 45:10.680]  speaking out against the Second Amendment in Texas New Mexico Arizona
[45:10.680 --> 45:15.200]  Nevada and California bad-mouthing the Second Amendment in all those states for
[45:15.200 --> 45:18.840]  what's happening in Mexico and saying we have a program tracing guns in the
[45:18.840 --> 45:23.360]  Mexico that prove this and then it turns out the documents he ran the whole
[45:23.360 --> 45:27.640]  thing now he's saying he knows nothing about it perjuring himself again
[45:27.640 --> 45:33.920]  before Congress we have them we have them we have them dead in our sights at
[45:33.920 --> 45:39.520]  point blank range politically and this can open up the entire criminal
[45:39.520 --> 45:46.120]  cesspit for the public to look at this can open the entire criminal government
[45:46.120 --> 45:50.920]  wide open and somebody has got to because the media is like stumbling
[45:50.920 --> 45:54.480]  around going well he you know he perjured himself and now he's up there
[45:54.480 --> 45:58.720]  perjuring himself again and so is the lady installing street lights with
[45:58.720 --> 46:02.560]  hidden microphones in them and telescreens at the Walmart and at the mall
[46:02.560 --> 46:06.760]  of America saying spy on your neighbors I mean wake me up from this nightmare and
[46:06.760 --> 46:11.760]  warrantless checkpoints now run by the feds on the highway I mean wake me up
[46:11.760 --> 46:17.560]  from this end it stop it come on there's the thing it's gonna get worse and
[46:17.560 --> 46:22.600]  worse let's go to Paul Watson Paul do you realize why I am in such a state over
[46:22.600 --> 46:25.080]  this right now
[46:25.080 --> 46:37.880]  well well yes Watson you're on the air well I mean it's not DOJ official new
[46:37.880 --> 46:45.120]  of ACF gum walking in April 2010 Lanny A. Brewer well of course he knew he was the
[46:45.120 --> 46:51.200]  one who informed Eric Holder about it three months later and CBS News has got
[46:51.200 --> 46:58.280]  the documents on that so for him to head up again after in 2009 he briefed
[46:58.280 --> 47:03.800]  Congress on project gun walk I'm talking about Eric Holder and project gun
[47:03.800 --> 47:09.760]  walk there was of course the overarching theme of which fast and furious
[47:09.760 --> 47:15.280]  with all these reincarnation gun running to Mexico so it's late and perjury as
[47:15.280 --> 47:19.640]  he said last week the Politano was caught doing the same thing she get
[47:19.640 --> 47:25.440]  press conference conference in 2009 explaining the whole project and they
[47:25.440 --> 47:29.800]  should get so last week and so she never heard of it until after the death of the
[47:29.800 --> 47:34.680]  war patrol agent well listen you're on a cell phone Paul you're on a cell phone

[47:55.920 --> 48:00.800]  total perjury and just go over all of this because because the mainstream media
[48:00.800 --> 48:04.320]  is not covering it I mean they admit wow it looks like he's perjuring himself
[48:04.320 --> 48:10.080]  looks like he gave stinking press conferences about this program I mean
[48:10.080 --> 48:14.600]  this is like this is like them saying Barack Obama was an elected president or
[48:14.600 --> 48:20.120]  George Washington didn't exist or I mean it's so a hundred percent caught
[48:20.120 --> 48:22.880]  lying Paul
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.720]  well not just the documents though cuz see people won't read the DOJ documents

[49:12.200 --> 49:17.160]  thing Paul and I for one have had enough of it I for one of not putting up with
[49:17.160 --> 49:21.040]  it and I want to throw the gauntlet down to these slime bags I mean these are
[49:21.040 --> 49:26.480]  people allowing people to bring drugs in and then meanwhile shipping guns out
[49:26.480 --> 49:31.520]  including gun gun guns to gangs in the US I mean their crooks of course they're
[49:31.520 --> 49:36.080]  putting up street lights that listen to us of course they're militarizing the
[49:36.080 --> 49:39.800]  police of course they're getting ready for martial law of course they're
[49:39.800 --> 49:45.000]  reading our email these are criminals criminals get it through your head

[49:50.000 --> 49:58.320]  abortion and open borders and oh my god is there no way and carbon taxes and the
[49:58.320 --> 50:04.200]  fellow reserve Herman Kang mobster Watson I'm gonna let you go but how long

[50:10.680 --> 50:16.320]  job I'll see you buddy okay I have gone beyond anger in fact I just physically
[50:16.320 --> 50:19.040]  got nauseated here on air probably because I haven't eaten and I ran this
[50:19.040 --> 50:24.720]  morning I jogged this morning and swim so I probably need something but I'm in
[50:24.720 --> 50:31.560]  a I am in an absolutely disgusted view I cannot look at Holder I cannot look at
[50:31.560 --> 50:38.760]  at Reno's reincarnation Napolitano I mean just the lying disgusting pastiness
[50:38.760 --> 50:45.120]  of these weak scum perched on us doing all these horrible things to us running
[50:45.120 --> 50:50.240]  flu hoaxes with deadly vaccines Gardasil garbage just everything they do all
[50:50.240 --> 50:54.720]  these murdering wars with Obama prancing around talking about peace giving
[50:54.720 --> 50:59.600]  al-Qaeda crews what weapons systems shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles I
[50:59.600 --> 51:03.360]  mean come on this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[51:03.360 --> 51:07.720]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[51:07.720 --> 51:11.760]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[51:11.760 --> 51:15.680]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[51:15.680 --> 51:19.320]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[51:19.320 --> 51:23.880]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[51:23.880 --> 51:27.920]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[51:27.920 --> 51:31.720]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[51:31.720 --> 51:35.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[51:35.360 --> 51:39.680]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[53:58.840 --> 54:28.080]  today. It is archetypally sickening. It is disgusting. It makes me want to
[54:28.080 --> 54:34.120]  vomit physically to know these are crooks to know they're involved in a
[54:34.120 --> 54:39.680]  criminal takeover of our country and to know that they fully intend to carry
[54:39.680 --> 54:46.720]  out all manner of horrible wickedness and these puppets the politano Mueller
[54:46.720 --> 54:53.600]  Holder they'll come and go but the sickening criminal anti-liberty agenda
[54:53.600 --> 54:59.480]  I mean they're really destroying our country right now just like they're
[54:59.480 --> 55:10.160]  destroying Mexico and they are 100% not just in memos but on video at press
[55:10.160 --> 55:13.320]  conferences I'm gonna play it later in the next hour after I go to calls after
[55:13.320 --> 55:22.680]  I've settled down on video all of them running the program and saying we're
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.800]  tracing guns we're doing all this and now caught and then they still go up and
[55:26.800 --> 55:31.400]  say we didn't know this was happening and that's the tip of the iceberg we
[55:31.400 --> 55:36.040]  know they're shipping guns into Indiana Chicago Tampa other cities I told you
[55:36.040 --> 55:39.800]  that six eight months ago now it's in the news but just a minor footnote they
[55:39.800 --> 55:44.760]  ship guns to groups in the United States that are the cartels that are in
[55:44.760 --> 55:53.360]  favor they allow drug cartels to operate right here in Austin I mean it is the
[55:53.360 --> 55:59.160]  government is on the take the government is the mafia and does that mean the
[55:59.160 --> 56:03.480]  average Dudley do right cop is bad no that mean the average bureaucrats bad
[56:03.480 --> 56:09.520]  no but the country has cancer we don't have much time to get rid of it I mean
[56:09.520 --> 56:13.760]  if you can't recognize tyranny when it's in in your face then you don't have any
[56:13.760 --> 56:17.120]  hope now the good news is people are starting to wake up we're finding out
[56:17.120 --> 56:20.480]  who the good guys are under the bad guys are we're getting all sorts of media aid
[56:20.480 --> 56:23.880]  from groups we never even knew where our friends who are concerned about what's
[56:23.880 --> 56:27.080]  happening and you're seeing other people who we always thought were good
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.360]  showing their true colors right now people are deciding which side they're
[56:31.360 --> 56:37.520]  on and that's why I try to have fun with this show I try to you know just be a
[56:37.520 --> 56:41.600]  regular person but I try to enjoy the fact that we're having an effect but I
[56:41.600 --> 56:46.400]  can't because because it's too little too late sometimes you know I have that
[56:46.400 --> 56:55.560]  fear I mean I know we're in danger we're in grave danger we're in serious
[56:55.560 --> 57:00.040]  danger and I'm past even getting chills now I'm just sick of it I'm tired of it
[57:00.040 --> 57:04.560]  it's ridiculous to have these criminals running all over us and we won't wake up
[57:04.560 --> 57:11.920]  to it I mean people have woken up but they haven't woken up to just how bad it
[57:11.920 --> 57:20.320]  is they haven't woken up to just how crazy reality is just how I mean think
[57:20.320 --> 57:24.240]  about it these criminals have been operating since 1947 with total national
[57:24.240 --> 57:28.360]  security anonymity and unlimited funding now what do you think what happened to
[57:28.360 --> 57:32.520]  any group if that happened over time the worst of the worst would get in power
[57:32.520 --> 57:37.640]  and recruit more of the worst the worst and you would get a criminal mass build
[57:37.640 --> 57:41.880]  up until it exploded into tyranny and you'd have people running around putting
[57:41.880 --> 57:44.760]  up street lights that listen to you and sticking their hands down your kids
[57:44.760 --> 57:49.160]  pants and taxing you and spiking your water with fluoride to brain damage in
[57:49.160 --> 57:53.880]  trying to push mercury filled shots on you and GMO food and releasing mosquitoes
[57:53.880 --> 57:59.480]  that have vaccines in them so you can't avoid it New York Times yesterday I mean
[57:59.480 --> 58:04.760]  I mean it it's just the the what criminals come up with is just so out of
[58:04.760 --> 58:09.400]  control criminals like screwing stuff up they like robin banks because they like
[58:09.400 --> 58:16.040]  robin banks psychopaths like doing bad things because they like it well you

[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.880]  agents having fist fights in the Phoenix office saying this is killing people I
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.840]  won't be part of it and being ordered by their supervisors to continue it it
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.240]  wasn't just them ordering gun shops to sell guns to certain people that was the
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:10.440]  cover to blame the Second Amendment they were shipping 18 wheelers of guns into
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:15.480]  Mexico to certain key cartels they were shipping them into the drug cartels in
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:20.640]  the US and coming up later we have the video clips I'm going to show you big
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.720]  sis caught lying and I'm going to show you the news article Paul wrote about it
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.960]  last week we did a nightly news report on as well where she gave a press
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.480]  conference with the Deputy Attorney General she's standing behind him while
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.480]  he talks about this very program and then she gets up last week and says she
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:44.720]  never heard of it and perjured herself I mean it is it makes Nixon saying I'm
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:51.040]  not a crook I'm not a crook it is it is everything we've known is going on and
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:56.800]  then some all coming out what did civil Edmunds say on the day of 9-11 FBI NSA
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:02.460]  translator listening to the Arabic what did she say she heard when she broke
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.040]  her gag order two years ago she testified secretly to Congress and they
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.560]  told her a little lady you don't tell anybody now what you know that's how
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.600]  they always do it tell us what you know in secret under oath little sweetie cake
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:21.920]  and then then we're going to get to the bottom of this and then after they find
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:27.520]  out she's like okay Al Qaeda was under US government command under the CIA command
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.840]  and they were talking about drug dealing money laundering child kidnapped
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.960]  trafficking sex trafficking weapons selling and bin Laden was under their
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:42.120]  command or someone they were calling bin Laden and this is the intercepts NSA
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.520]  intercepts they're like little lady you are bound under congressional gag
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.520]  order you don't tell anybody that and then it goes on and on and on this is
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:56.840]  what the government does it's who they are and if we continue to be naive there
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.520]  is no future now I'm gonna try to settle down because I blew up during the break
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.840]  they had the TV on in there and I was listening to Holder and they had it on
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.680]  screen that he denied knowing but said his deputy knew I mean he is such a
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:14.360]  liar this came directly from the White House and of course above that the only
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.760]  thing different is Bush didn't blame the Second Amendment for their operation he
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:23.160]  just used to control everything and then our Coddocks and the money coming in
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.400]  they went one further and blame the Second Amendment and that's why they
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.400]  gave press conferences admitting gunrunning they've all given press
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.560]  conferences Watson's doing a new article boiling it all down with a new
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:40.040]  perjury you know a lot of people have been trained to accept lying and perjury
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.680]  by government they've been trained to accept CIA drug dealing they've been
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.040]  trained to accept corruption collateral damage all of that torture
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:54.040]  secret arrest police state but I I guess have the gift of it still hits me it's
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:58.520]  still upsets me and today it hit me hard I mean going back about 40 minutes ago
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:04.920]  during that break it hit me hard it hit me so hard I feel like I've been run
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:10.680]  over right now because man these are some bold crux I mean they're going up
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.440]  before Congress and we don't nothing like Sergeant Schultz and Hogan's heroes I
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:21.240]  know nothing nothing and they're right there caught red-handed it's like the
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.560]  cops bust somebody and they've shot videos of themselves over 10 years
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.840]  cutting up women they've kidnapped and and they've got all this video of them
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.240]  doing it themselves and there are the graves in the basement and the guy gets
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.960]  up on stand and says I didn't do this it's ridiculous I mean it's it's
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:42.760]  something to behold because you know the Republicans aren't gonna go after them
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.400]  on this and you know it's all just a bunch of political point scoring going
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.320]  on I mean here's another headline operation armed crusaders DHS to
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.840]  Palatano's own Mexican gun trafficking program yeah they were all involved in
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:01.680]  it I mean this stuff is all just coming out in CBS AP Fox News and they don't
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:08.440]  care what's their answer they just come out and say we're not involved in this
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.920]  and you know there's blackmailing going on you know they've released the Knicks
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.760]  and tapes right when they were about to set him up and bring him down he was
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.120]  like you know the Kennedy thing we need to get under those documents I happen to
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.840]  know a few things here tricky dig ties I might have to bring that up to the to
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.440]  the FBI and other people Kennedy think they want to look into that a little
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.520]  course he knew he was involved in the killing of Kennedy the evidence is
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.080]  overwhelming show me that this kind of stuff goes on and they all just they all
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:45.680]  just use this against each other and then here I am just wanting my second
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.520]  amendment wanting my private property wanting my family not wanting the
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.800]  government to come take my kids I mean I read articles earlier where you forget
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.760]  to buy some chocolate milk when you're getting groceries like I've done or a
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:01.120]  sandwich you have no criminal record and they come and arrest you you know hey
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.880]  did you pay for that sandwich wrapper you have in your hand we've been watching
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:08.240]  on the surveillance oh I forgot let me pay we're taking your kids I mean that's
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.760]  that's associated press today
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:20.160]  it didn't matter if she was a master sergeant on leave because she's
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.360]  pregnant that matter of her and her husband have no criminal record it
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:30.640]  doesn't matter you have a $5 sandwich you forgot to pay for I mean I'll
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.640]  guarantee you these cops that took her to jail I had the CPS take her kids I
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:40.560]  will guarantee you they have walked out of a store with something everybody I
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.160]  know who's done it
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:51.000]  I've been on the run before going to 7-Eleven while I'm gassing up get water
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.200]  grab a donut and eat eat the donut by the time I get to the counter and then
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.080]  walk out and come back in and pay for the Krispy Kreme you could tell I don't
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.160]  eat donuts anymore somebody buys them every day at the office and I have to
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:10.000]  look at them and not eat them the point is is that we've all done this I mean
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.680]  yeah if they if they sure cop gets your license runs it okay no criminal record
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.360]  I'm sure it's a mistake you know the point is it's this now if you've got
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.960]  somebody trying to eat a sandwich and get out of there but they just bought
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:26.160]  groceries and they've got you know five convictions of shoplifting go ahead and
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.560]  arrest them I mean you know that that's the whole point of this system but then
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:41.320]  it's not enough after they'd arrested her they took her daughter you know
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.720]  there's no terrorist actually see so this whole see something say something
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:52.640]  is they see a mother drink one glass of wine with her children at a luncheon in

[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:02.480]  and they pull her over and take her two kids away saying well you you had you
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.240]  know you you drink one drink and drove and that's illegal I mean is that the
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.680]  type of world people just ready to tattle ready to dial a number ready to

[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:09.640]  the US economy is right now will we have a v-shaped recovery or will it be a
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:14.320]  w-shaped one where the nation slips back into recession of course if you think
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.920]  that Washington can spend or inflate its way out of a downturn you've got
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:22.000]  nothing to worry about but as you know I have my doubts so let me tell you about

[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:54.440]  change I'm afraid the trend will continue call Midas Resources today at

[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.000]  really my name I'm not you know I think that's a cool name I wasn't putting it
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  down I was actually born here too I met you down at the in the Fed and Dallas
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.400]  being like kids we took a picture with you I don't know if you remember not I
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.120]  remember all the great folks there I'm sure I recognize you thank you for
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:53.120]  coming out to stand up against the real enemy you know I'm angry this whole
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.720]  thing makes me angry and talk to my brother which is a huge historian and
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:02.840]  he firmly believed that now 11 wasn't an inside job which blew my mind and I
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:08.520]  opened his eyes and and awoke awoken him and he's just like well you need to run
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.440]  for office is what he said you got to do something run for office is like that's
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:16.600]  not something I can do but I know I have to do something and watching the
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:20.880]  documentaries in and and get on a Charlotte Fitzgerald last week I took
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:25.280]  my children out of school because it was a red root red women red ribbon week
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.880]  drug awareness week or whatever and the school is giving me a hard time for that
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.760]  yeah no they've got the statistics drug use has only gone up under this they
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.600]  actually teach kids how to use drugs at those and introduce it it's shown that
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.120]  sex education actually gets kids interested in sex because they teach you
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:48.960]  about things that you know nine ten year olds wouldn't even be thinking about
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:54.600]  and so they destroy their innocence it'd be one thing when they were 12 13 14 to
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.240]  teach them about diseases and you know about about how the human body works but
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.200]  no no this is all sexual indoctrination drug indoctrination when I went to
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:10.880]  school the cops teaching anti drug awareness I knew were involved with
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:15.360]  police dealing drugs so they're basically they're advertising their product to the
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:22.000]  children and it's totally sick it's totally evil and it's all done by
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.640]  design Hollywood making drugs look cool that's all product placement and so the
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.920]  school is saying you're bad because you don't want them there being politically
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.280]  brainwashed you know why we've gone from number one in the world to now dead last
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.520]  and then some behind every industrialized country because it's all
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:42.320]  about political thinking it's all about political correctness it's all about
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:48.280]  drugs it's all about safety it's all about tagling it's all about anti
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:52.640]  bullying it's all about don't run at recess don't don't don't shake hands
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.800]  it's all about prisoner training instead of reading writing an arithmetic you
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.000]  know people ask why the economy is falling apart our education system has
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.400]  been destroyed by design we've been deindustrialized by design the taxes
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:10.480]  are too high on the middle class that's why we're falling apart but so the
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:14.920]  school's quote giving you trouble huh well what they had said was when I had
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.400]  called them let them know because I have a pre-care and two kindergartners and a
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.280]  fifth grader and I let them know that they would not be attending school and
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:26.000]  they and they said well they had to talk to the principal it was up to him
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.800]  whether he wanted to excuse it or not that's like I really don't care about
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.680]  your point system I'm just letting you know my children aren't gonna be there
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:36.520]  this week and they had a counselor call me and make sure that I understood what
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.600]  the week was about and I opened her eyes and I and I gave her the link to the
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:46.160]  Charlotte it should be a interview that that was done and she was she was not
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.360]  aware and she's like well I'm glad that you are aware but the principal decided
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:55.160]  not to excuse my absences and send me papers in the mail or letters in the
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.440]  mail let me know that they were extensive absences so I guess they're
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.880]  gonna follow up on that which I really don't care now listen listen here's the
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.320]  deal you go to the principal's office with all the news articles magazines or
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.520]  the CIA's been caught bringing drugs in where fast and furious is connected to
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:19.440]  drug trafficking and you say look I'm done okay number one certainly kindergartners
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.720]  shouldn't be taught about drugs it's all about what's in mommy and daddy's
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.400]  medicine cabinet to this is the state look the schools are reeducation camps
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.000]  now and if you've got to have them in there the best thing to do is pull them
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.520]  out during the brainwashing sessions but look you're doing the absolute right
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.160]  thing listen you know all over the country they give kids inoculations now
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:47.000]  without asking the parents California has passed a law to do it and and I'll
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.120]  guarantee you when it comes time for an oculation this same public school will
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:56.160]  lie to you and tell you it's the law at that point they're engaged in racketeering
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:01.200]  and fraud and at that point you should sue them they know there's no law they
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:05.520]  know they threatened to kick your kid out and then trigger truancy which is a
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.400]  law but not when they kick your child out now it's not truancy so it's all
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:16.920]  color of law racketeering scam and so you let them know that and you let them
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.360]  know that you may think you're even gonna gang up on me and try to call CPS you
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.600]  go ahead and do it I'll sue you personally and you may beat the rap but

[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:03.840]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.200]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:12.360]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:16.400]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:20.280]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:24.560]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:33.040]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:40.960]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:12.440]  listen I figured something out over the last few years that I haven't really
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.720]  articulated properly then I'm going back to your calls in the news but it's this
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:24.920]  Americans are big-hearted good people on average the soul to the earth and I've
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:27.680]  been around the world but I've also talked to people more well traveled than
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:34.240]  I America is a great place but because we think it can't happen here it's like
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:37.960]  we're a dodo bird when the sailors showed up at the island these dodo birds
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.840]  walk right over to them they were hungry they conk them on the head and eat them
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:45.160]  they became extinct because we haven't dealt with as much tyranny as some
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:48.800]  other countries we're like domesticated animals that just don't even know what's
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:56.080]  going on but I've already told you that analogy the point I wanted to get at
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.360]  here
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.220]  oh I don't even remember the point I was gonna make me out cuz I got off into my
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:07.600]  dodo bird analogy it'll pop in my head in a minute
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:15.200]  oh I remember what it is it's hospitality people are into hospitality all over
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:19.440]  this nation and I always heard people say yeah people in New York are rude
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.800]  Yankees are rude I think my experiences being in New York dozens of times the
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:31.360]  people are great smart hard-working really nice friendly it's the the police
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:38.520]  are pretty darn rude so I guess that's what we're tourists get that idea people
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:42.360]  tend to have cliches in their head of folks from Europe have come to Texas and
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.800]  I whole life people from other parts of the country they say where's the tumbleweeds
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:48.800]  where's the horses I'm like well you drive about a hundred miles west of here
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:55.640]  you'll find them you know the state's gigantic but it's these cliches but
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:01.400]  getting back to the point I'm making is that it's people think it's almost like
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:09.720]  hospitality to let bureaucrats boss you around or to grovel people kind of hat
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:14.600]  in hand go up to the DMV counter people kind of hat in hand go up to the school
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:20.400]  principle people kind of hat in hand now it's one thing if someone's respectful
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:27.080]  of you to be respectful to them but we've kissed up to government so long
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.600]  that they actually think that they are our bosses now on average and they treat
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:36.000]  us like trash and we've also brought in so many tens of millions of people from
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.640]  third-world countries a lot of them very intelligent and hard-working but they're
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:44.640]  used to hardcore tyranny so they step and fetch and the system has gotten used
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.000]  to that especially and they think well this is the way it is and so you'll see
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.920]  police in New York narrow their eyes and walk over to somebody who throws the
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.120]  wrong thing in the trash and threaten them and wreck them a ticket and try to
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.880]  intimidate them and they've been told to do that the system wants you to feel
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:08.480]  small and I couldn't believe it when I flew out of Austin one guy's a fan last
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.440]  week or guess more than a week ago now at the TSA hey Alex how you doing it one
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:16.400]  guy older guy the gray hair goes this is Alex Jones he's a troublemaker I thought
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:22.320]  he was joking but then he went further it was like yeah he's a troublemaker and
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:26.920]  I said yeah I'm going to expose the TSA with Jesse Vidura in Las Vegas yeah he's
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:31.120]  suing you guys and the guy's like where are you going you know stuff like that
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:34.720]  and then I was when I was when I flew back and was walking to the airport he
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.560]  was walking by me and actually tried to kind of look at me intimidate me he was
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.560]  kind of I mean that guy is a joke do you think you intimidate me what is your
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.320]  problem how embarrassing for you that you've got this uppity attitude when
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:54.080]  you're a quote public servant but see you know you're not a servant you know
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:59.920]  that it's a thugs world it's a little nobody's world isn't it in your system
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.880]  while America collapses this short little time where devils like you get to
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:09.960]  have their fun I've never had the TSA do anything to me at Austin but be
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:14.200]  respectful and nice other parts of the country buildings Montana treated like
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:18.320]  absolute trash along with old ladies I mean I thought I was a Nazi Germany I've
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.520]  had the LA people make fun of me and laugh at me and ask me about a problem
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:31.440]  and I got in their face and that was two black guys I think they were racist but
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:39.960]  but the point is is that is that you could only take so much of these people you
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:43.240]  can only take so much of it and I tell you Jesse Ventura can't take anymore I
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:46.600]  mean you bring up the TSA to him he's a guy who's all into controlling his anger
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:52.120]  and you could tell he physically looks like a you know a volcano under the
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:56.400]  surface when I told him that they had checkpoints on the roads he said that's
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.920]  not true it can't be true I showed him and he was mad for an hour not not
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:04.680]  showing it but literally like I guess you're right it's true I I mean that's
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:09.600]  a normal response though to America has an internal checkpoints and now they
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.400]  want to grab our genitals there it's normal to get upset it's normal to
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.480]  grieve it's normal to get angry it's normal I can't take it anymore and I'm
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:30.400]  going to your calls but you know all of you authoritarians I careful what you
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.320]  wish for you think you got all this firepower and all the surveillance and
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:38.080]  all over the country for years but now they're just announcing it they've got
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.160]  microphones listening for hundreds of yards around in parks I saw articles
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:45.480]  national parks have them hidden everywhere the government all feels like
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.040]  they've been let in on the secret little command centers and they go in listen
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:53.160]  to everybody and they've got cameras and rest stops and now in hotel rooms and
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:58.080]  school bathrooms and they all get off on it all you idiots in government and
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:00.840]  corporate America that think you're part of the power structure because you're
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:04.760]  led into the national security level and you're given a little stipend of cash
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:10.080]  have you looked at yourselves at your grade scores at your psychological score
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:13.960]  at what you look like physically you've been hired because you're the only
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:20.600]  trash they can get to carry out this type of evil okay and you know at first
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.440]  the TSA wasn't like this is we're gonna check bags for bombs it was just
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:29.680]  regular types of curable one job but as they asked me to do more and more the
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.600]  people get either more and more stupid or more and more evil and so now the
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.080]  epidemic of TSA robbing everyone and child molesting is in the news every
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.280]  day of course I mean what type of man wants to grab children's genitals all
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:51.520]  day hmm what type of man wants to rub my chest I never even aired the audio of
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:54.080]  this I think at the end of the day because I'm embarrassed by it because I
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:57.520]  had to get on the plane I wanted to go ahead and see what was gonna happen I
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:01.000]  knew they were gonna go ahead and find me and throw me out or arrest me so as I
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.680]  said I don't like it I do this with protest and you know the guy was like
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:10.600]  I'm just gonna check here what you wouldn't go as its own word he would do
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:17.000]  it at the end as people like this like to exercise it out in the open that's
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.600]  why Bill Gates like to you know release the deadly mosquitoes onto a crowd he's
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:24.240]  with and and say he's releasing them worldwide to vaccinate you whether you
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:29.720]  like it or not criminals like to flaunt it and and the criminal type that the
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:37.320]  criminal psychological makeup you see I abhor the idea of making someone do
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:42.600]  something just to make them do it I'm powerful I'm aggressive I'm hyper
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.880]  dominant to the point of I want to see people empowered and built up little
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:52.600]  trash likes to sit there and bully people around real men like to take on
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:57.320]  bullies real men like to get on the field and defeat the enemy not sit there
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:04.120]  and and and and what mow down women and children societally all right I'm done
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:09.800]  I'm done and I'll just get to the fast and furious next hour it's so important
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:14.200]  but I've got to somehow get out of this mode of just frothing anger and get my
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:21.520]  articles and highlight them and go over some of the clips here man oh let's go
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:27.600]  ahead and this is a journey into slavery so so to finish the simple thought
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:35.480]  people think it's like being friendly or or being being humbled to let people
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:39.160]  abuse you and boss you around who are in government or corporate systems they
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:45.960]  think it's respectful and and also high-powered lawyers I know that I'm
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:50.000]  friends with and business people they go well I don't let them get to me yeah
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.480]  they body scan me then they grab my genitals but I there just yeah you're
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.920]  right it's all a bunch of theater but I just I just I just deal with it you know
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:03.240]  there's also this male attitude of I'm just gonna muddle through it I listen
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:09.160]  you don't do that with your rights you don't well I'm tough I'll just take it
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:15.280]  well I'm you know what I'm gonna let this person you know I mean if I go to a
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.400]  lunch counter somewhere like at barbecue and people are rude to me I'll say why
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:22.520]  are you being rude to me because see I know it's uncomfortable for them and
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.080]  it's uncomfortable for me but I've got to do that I've got to do that in front of
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.840]  my children I'm not looking for trouble but if you're looking for it you came
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:34.840]  to the right place you understand that I'm not here to be walked on I'm not a
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:41.520]  floor mat you understand that and that's what America is about listen if you
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.800]  don't like being uppity about your rights if you don't like being into
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.840]  freedom if you don't like being in the private property if you if you like this
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.880]  collectivism you shouldn't be here you can debate whether you like collectivism
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.320]  better or not or what system we should have but see this is the country that
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:59.360]  became the wealthiest and the most powerful on the free market not what we
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:05.320]  have now this crony capitalist garbage and so you people that that that they
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:10.480]  call me extreme and a throwback in a hillbilly or a radical because I really
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:15.040]  know what America is all about you are the people out in left field okay and I
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.600]  don't care how many dramas or TV shows demonize Patriots I don't care how many
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:25.240]  cop shows demonizes how many government training manuals demonizes I know I'm
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:29.680]  right I know I've read the Federalist papers I know I do the hard research I
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.560]  know I've been proven right and I know where this country is going and you're
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:40.920]  not gonna like it a lot of you play mind games with yourselves as well you play
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:44.880]  these mind games that convince yourself you're part of the power structure you
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:47.480]  people are in for a rude awakening well you're already starting to wake up aren't
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.120]  you know the awakenings here it's just you haven't woken up to one-tenth of it
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:54.760]  yet and when you wake up to one-tenth of it you haven't woken up to one one
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:58.840]  thousands of it because the more I learn the more I'm blown away that it's
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:03.680]  always 50 layers more sickening and horrible than I could even imagine if
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:09.080]  you can't imagine it they're doing it because there's seven billion people and
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.120]  hundreds of millions of government control freaks and people and can you
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:19.640]  imagine all the stuff they the Bible says the wicked invent evil they went
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:25.120]  about inventing new forms of wickedness I forget the exact quote inventing evil
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.840]  inventing twistedness inventing mental illness and sickening this and weakness
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:38.400]  that's what we're facing okay okay I'm gonna go to legend or Lyndon I can't

[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:04.680]  Alexander 100% correct and I'm a victim of this tyranny and this is a red alert
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:08.800]  we are under severe attack right now I'm in federal court and my case number is
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:15.840]  10 is h-10-2698 I took him to federal court the Houston police both my
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:20.360]  police Department of Justice Harris County Jefferson County try to put me and
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:25.480]  my brothers in jail the life over false accusation and also they stole all our
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:30.840]  children so we at war now this is a red alert we have no criminal history we
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.680]  never done nothing wrong in life I'm an inventor and I'm a scientist and I've
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:38.760]  been trying to patent the project to open the industry for this country but so
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.720]  far it's fell on death that's who they assassin or come after his inventors
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.520]  well they've gone after hundreds of thousands of inventors the last 100
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:50.360]  years wow so what did they do to you this woman accidentally walked out with a
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.800]  sandwich will she ate it in the store and then she bought groceries but they
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:58.640]  went ahead and took her took her child from her and she's a master sergeant
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:05.160]  that's associated press what crimes are they accusing you of this they're
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:10.360]  accusing me of indecency with a child and and they and what they did was
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:15.000]  someone went in a lie because this my girlfriend's cousin hated our family so
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.960]  she went and told his lie the accuser police proved that the lie wasn't there
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:22.680]  they didn't even investigate right they threw it out but boom I picked up which
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:27.600]  is double jeopardy but what happened was they wanted to get us so bad what
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.840]  messed them up this is why they hadn't put me in jail because they've been
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:33.240]  trying to put me in jail for two years I was working for Houston yellow cab at
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:37.280]  the time of the accusation they said this happened in 2003 in Beaumont I was
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.200]  not in Beaumont 2003 I was working for Houston yellow cab in 2003 that whole
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:44.760]  year and I have my light bill where I was living they couldn't even place me in
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:48.000]  that county and that's the that's why I went to federal court once I went to
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.920]  federal court they tried to run away so they took Beaumont and Jersey County ran
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:56.080]  over to the Eastern District I'll tell you what the new witch hunt is
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:00.840]  dying Corrin Halliburton can be in the Houston Chronicle running giant white
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:04.800]  slavery rings that means sex slavery men women children you name it and they
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:08.320]  get in no trouble there's congressional hearings no trouble then they have these
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:17.600]  witch hunts out there and I saw a case where a a fella shot showed showed my
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:23.600]  film Dark Seekers of Sidemohemian Grove gave a copy to a 14-year-old kid to show
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:27.800]  his parents and and the police came and arrested him saying he may have
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:31.640]  sacrificed a child because the cops watch the Bohemian Grove thing in LA and
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:35.960]  I saw the court case documents that was hard to believe first they arrested him
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:39.280]  saying that they thought he'd done this ritual he's like no this is a film
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:44.880]  released it's on national TV it's on it's on it's on trio network then they
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:48.680]  said okay well you tried to molest the 14-year-old even the 14-year-old said
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:55.720]  no he didn't touch me and so he went to jail for showing them my film I mean
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:00.720]  they listen they will they can send a ham sandwich to prison that's been proven
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:05.360]  they only want to put innocent people in jail though it came out that in Texas
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:10.760]  alone Houston Chronicle in one year they released 200,000 aggravated felon
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:16.080]  illegal aliens a napolitano does it because they want them here I mean this
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:19.320]  is so incredible and then they will throw the book at innocent people all
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:25.640]  day long because again the government is a bunch of wicked devils I'm telling you
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.480]  it now some police departments aren't completely evil and that sounds like the
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:32.640]  police investigated found out it wasn't true but some police departments they
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:36.760]  don't care if you have a hundred percent iron-clad alibi look what the DNA
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:40.960]  evidence shows more than a third of the people on death row are totally innocent
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:46.000]  and I saw a case just a few months ago we're a case out of Georgetown for 20
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.640]  years the prosecutor knew that the guy on death row was innocent and tried to
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:55.440]  cover it up just for his career I mean you talk about evil on you you know
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:01.680]  somebody's innocent and you are gonna let them die just for your own I mean
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:05.100]  that is evil and that's only the tip of the iceberg
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:10.040]  Lyndon anything else I want to tell you this we got a plan on we got a good
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:13.880]  plan once we get out of all this mess out of court we got a plan me and my
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:18.080]  brother to stop this tearing and we're gonna we got a plan for industry and
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:22.760]  we got a plan to stop the new order's agenda which is to take over the market

[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:11.040]  rogue website bill that would quote in the internet as we know it that's what
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:14.480]  one congressman is saying is running into more opposition if people learn how
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:18.720]  unconstitutional it is ending the process that's all coming up but right

[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:29.400]  hey mr. Jones are you good brother oh man I just I just wanted to make a plea to
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:33.240]  the American people if you didn't mind I'm from Canada I live in Victoria I can
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:38.040]  see Port Angeles Washington from my balcony and I just I'm a bleeding heart
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:42.080]  Canadian for your country I love you guys but not your government but the
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:45.880]  people because do you guys talk about your hospitality earlier it's not just
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:51.520]  that it is just this amazing spirit that just burns off of all the good true
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:55.800]  blooded American people that like thank you Canadians are Canadians are very
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:59.920]  nice and very friendly as well and again it seems like the nicer the
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:03.500]  people the more evil the government gets because it's like we think it's
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:08.000]  hospitality to be bossed around that's the opposite of how we should behave oh
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:13.640]  I know man like it's just sad you know if our forebears could see either one of
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.720]  our countries right now they'd be crying because you know what I'm looking at a
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:21.760]  picture of George Washington crossing the Delaware in the ice in the snow and
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:25.400]  you know the big old story about how his balls were hanging out that those are
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:30.200]  the people who founded your country and if you guys don't get that back if you
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:33.560]  guys can't find that now then you know what you're not just letting yourselves
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:37.840]  down or your children down people look to America because you know why that's
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:41.200]  the shining light Reagan said it's best man you guys with the city on the hill
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.400]  and if you guys don't play for it then we're letting the whole world down and
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:50.300]  it's 1776 worldwide brother it is imagine and he talked about Washington
[02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:56.680]  crossing the Delaware letting it all hang out he was crossing over to Trenton
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:00.080]  to fight the Germans the Hessian mercenaries I think it was like four to
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:04.840]  one and the point is a bunch of men froze to death on the nighttime below
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:11.440]  zero March people were falling through one the case of crossing into Trenton
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:16.080]  and it was a desperate gamble they had one one battle and he needed that
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:20.600]  propaganda victory and it's just amazing to now turn into this where our news is
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:24.880]  saying now is the Declaration of Independence legal can you say government
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:28.360]  isn't God and they're actually now demonizing the Declaration of Independence
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:33.200]  because you read that it is the opposite of what has been set up today I
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:37.400]  appreciate your call good to hear from you beautifully said Nathaniel let's go

[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:35.160]  can and the child's under there squealing and crying and begging and you
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:39.440]  know that child symbolizes all the people being hurt by tyranny the globalist
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:43.640]  people being starved to death by carbon taxes the World Bank UN program in
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:48.320]  Honduras and Uganda lining people up and murdering them for their property that's
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:51.960]  even in the New York Times but they're like well it's for the earth the fact
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:57.360]  that all of this is going on and I need more people to help me instead people
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:00.720]  are like oh well the government's bad but that car is not that heavy on that
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:07.800]  kid yeah it's just this attituder oh we couldn't pick the car up if we tried and
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:10.840]  you know the thing is those of us that are fighting tyranny we've got the car
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:14.440]  actually we're starting to lift up we can feel it starting to move but we need
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:19.000]  your help and it's just frustrating and let me tell you something it's going to
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:28.480]  get really evident it's going to get extremely evident in the years to come
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:36.200]  just how crazy and just how insane all of this is going to get and and a lot of
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.000]  you are going to wish you to done something you know there are a million
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.080]  things you can do speaking out to your neighbors standing up when people boss
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.920]  you around in the system learning the Bill of Rights the Constitution history
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:53.760]  common sense start a website start a radio blog go to an access TV show you
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:59.080]  know I had a dream last night and and you know you have a dream and then you
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.200]  forget about it right after you wake up it's what they say write it down right
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:05.200]  when you wake up but sometimes you wake up you don't even think about it and
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:08.800]  later in the day you remember it and I had a dream last night that I woke up
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:14.560]  from because a lot of times now I have dreams about video editing I have dreams
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:18.960]  where I'm doing the radio show I have dreams when I'm washing dishes you know
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:24.240]  just regular stuff I have dreams where I'm driving but I have these dreams now
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:27.760]  I've always had them and I have a lot where I'm working all night while I'm
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:31.560]  asleep and I'm thinking about this article or this report or this
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:36.480]  legislation and in my dreams I have all these epiphanies and a lot of better
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:40.040]  thoughts I already had at a point but never really covered on air and so my
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:45.320]  subconscious is saying cover this look at this and and trying to recall the
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.000]  whole dream I don't have total recall obviously and I don't have the times I
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.680]  want to go back to Alex and others that are holding the dream last night was
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:11:01.360]  about Alex you know you have noticed that in Pakistan in Central Asia and in
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:08.120]  India and in Africa and in the Middle East and in Latin America the UN has been
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:13.640]  caught thousands of times in the last 50 years giving people live polio and
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:20.200]  actually spreading the polio on purpose and Alex you have the documents on that
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:24.680]  you have the US government reports you shouldn't you know you've showed them
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:28.000]  before but do another report on it you know this is my subconscious I guess
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.960]  you could say God an angel whatever this is going on my dream and your inner
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:38.320]  voice whatever and you've got to show them that document were a hundred plus
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:44.680]  million people in the US contracted lethal cancers by the 70s the government
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:48.080]  estimates from the polio vaccine and you've got to show them the number of
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:53.680]  people wounded by regular polio and that the cancer deaths dwarf that and you've
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:58.000]  got to show where it's part of a Pentagon weaponized program and you need
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:03.160]  to do that and then my dream went into Pakistan but instead of just seeing the
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.360]  news articles it's it's like one of these dreams where you're in Pakistan
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:11.440]  you're actually watching the clinics and I mean how your brain conjures up these
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:15.960]  3d images of the people their faces it's like it's real I've actually had
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:19.120]  dreams that actually come true 100% before but I shouldn't even get into
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:23.360]  that the point is and I'm and I'm watching these CIA people injecting
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:32.880]  folks with the with the vaccine that they know has polio in it weaponized it
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:37.880]  kills almost everybody they give it to now I wake up about 3 a.m. and sweaty I
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:44.240]  get up I go to the bathroom I go against a good glass of water and I sit there and
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:50.680]  I'm just like is that real and I'm like yeah yeah I've got all those news
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:54.480]  articles but I've got it there's something there in the dream what is it
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:59.120]  okay it's the connections that been a lot and that's right so he gives me a
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.360]  headache right now just to recall this and so just now I'm talking to the last
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:07.200]  caller who's bringing up his mom who's a medical doctor and he's trying to show
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:10.640]  her documents that you know the vaccine zone inserts where it says it causes
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:15.760]  brain damage gion beret narcolepsy you know cancer and she won't look she gets
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:18.800]  emotional and says her son needs to be put on psychotropic we're gonna go back
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:25.120]  to him in a minute and when he's talking it makes me remember in fact give me a
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:28.240]  document cam shot please guys wherever you want wherever the cameras aimed all
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:31.280]  I'll put the article for prison planet TV viewers but I'll give you the
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:36.240]  headlines so you can look this up yourself and as he's talking I run out
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:41.600]  during the break after he's done speaking the weird thing is that camera
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:45.040]  used to be able to like aim right here and then my shadow wouldn't be on it
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:49.280]  now but I think it's because we changed that light position okay well let's do
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:52.240]  it over here I don't care if there's a shadow I mean the fact is I just we I
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:56.320]  just want to get a close shot on it yeah I mean I don't care if I can hold it
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:00.040]  right here we'll show it that way thanks they change one light in here and it
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:10.960]  change everything okay continuing so I'm sitting there and he's talking and I'm
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.040]  remembering all this because you're having a dream about the CIA injecting
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:27.200]  people with live polio and claiming that the program was supposedly to get DNA
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.480]  so you could find out if bin Laden was staying there when that has nothing to
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:35.160]  do with it like bin Laden was out there getting getting vaccinated and you
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.120]  realize it's just a cover story of another fake cover story people are
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:43.360]  saying what are you talking about here's the London Guardian from July 2011
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:48.600]  Monday July 11th CIA organized fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:55.720]  Laden's family DNA senior Pakistan doctor who organized vaccine program in
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:01.040]  Abbottabad arrested by ISI for working with US agents and it was in the AP
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:05.800]  Reuters everywhere this is admitted a CIA organized fake vaccination program in
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:09.680]  the town where it believed Osama bin Laden was hiding is an elaborate attempt
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:13.520]  to obtain DNA from the fugitive al Qaeda leader's family a guardian
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:17.320]  investigation is found yeah like they're gonna be going to the government
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:23.320]  facility for the free shots as part of extensive preparations for the raid that
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:28.600]  killed bin Laden in May believe that I got a bridge I'll sell you CIA agents
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:33.400]  recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organize the vaccine drive in Abbottabad
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:38.960]  even starting the project in the poor part of town to make it look more
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:42.560]  authentic according to Pakistan US government officials how would how would
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:46.560]  that magically get the bin Laden family over there in a city of like a million
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:49.960]  people or whatever it is to have them go to the free clinic I mean this is just
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:56.040]  it's like saying we wanted to get Alex's DNA so we were his family so we went to
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:16:01.000]  north Austin 20 miles from him and hoped one day he'd come in the clinic I
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.560]  mean it's like we wanted to catch a shark so we we for five minutes dropped a
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:09.680]  line in the water in the middle of nowhere with no sharks around I mean
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:13.480]  it's just it's just like we wanted to find an Easter Bunny so we went looking
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:17.800]  around for one of the field or we went snipe hunting I mean it's just total
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:27.040]  bull total and unmitigated bull now again I woke up and I thought this was a
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:30.680]  program and I've got to do research on because I know I've seen it over the
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:34.880]  years actually they just in a minute jaren found two of the articles where in
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:40.400]  Pakistan in US government programs through doctors that were hired and UN
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:44.000]  programs they've shot them up with real polio and we actually were able in a
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.040]  minute one minute because it took the first two minutes to the of the break
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:53.360]  to grab these articles we were able to get this these articles here it is CA
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:58.200]  organized fake vaccination drive Pakistan CIA vaccine Rouge reports
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:01.680]  sparks fear and look what kind of vaccine it is look at the photo it's
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:10.040]  polio liquid that's the one they give you the live polio with boys and girls you
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:16.920]  know our pediatrician here in Austin he's since retired one day you know I
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:20.560]  would go to him because he doesn't really push vaccines but he's not anti
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:24.800]  vaccine he just won't harass you if your children aren't vaccinated and he came
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:28.880]  to me or you can keep documenting over here if you want thank you he came to
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:35.800]  me and you know while he was shaking my son out we was about three and he said
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:39.720]  you know Alex I watch your show sometimes he goes you know I volunteer
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:42.680]  like most doctors do once a year for city clinics for the poor and you know
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:48.200]  we were given people live polio vaccine that does have the cancer virus
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:53.080]  SV 40 in it even though that that's really illegal in the US that's what we
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:56.840]  were given to give the poor kids on the east side I said well come on my show and
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:18:00.600]  he goes no don't you dare quote me he goes I know you're a journalist and
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:04.920]  it's just like doctor doctor privilege with the patient you will not tell
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:08.680]  anybody who I am that I told you that I said okay but I'll say you told me I
[02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:12.480]  just won't say who my doctor is who my son's doctors I mean you know why
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:16.840]  wouldn't he come out and talk about this you know there he is he comes over
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:26.120]  you know top of his class pediatrician I've looked him up and and he just he
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:30.760]  just he'll tell me that but he won't tell anybody but but again I woke up
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:36.160]  saying investigate this this is key Alex and the dream was elaborate I can't
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:39.320]  remember at all and then I had to remember where it is this real now now
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:42.120]  you're saying well you're saying the government gives people live polio oh
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:53.480]  really here it is here it is right here vaccine linked polio hits Nigeria CBS
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:59.640]  news again you can type in polio vaccine had live virus Pakistan you can pull
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:03.760]  that up that we'll search that next here's another one mutant polio virus
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:08.760]  spreads in Nigeria that's just one of the latest articles but it goes on to
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:13.840]  to just say in the article that it was the World Health Organization vaccine
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:18.960]  spreading the virus and it might extend behind Africa a new super deadly one
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:24.920]  because it turned out it was a live weaponized version in the polio vaccine
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:32.880]  they gave them and it says Africans believe that the Western world's plan
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:37.520]  to sterilize Africans or give them AIDS the sad polio reality fuels misguided
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:43.240]  fears and underscores the challenges authorities face using a flawed vaccine
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:46.080]  but what did Bill Gates come out yesterday and say and what are the
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:50.520]  New York Times say they're gonna release the mosquitoes with the vaccine in them
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:54.200]  whether you like it or not and so whatever they want to give you is loaded
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:59.480]  into the backs into the mosquito and it's basically high-tech viruses that are

[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:28.480]  yeah every waking second all I think about is the fact that in hundreds of
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:34.680]  countries the UN has been caught I mean listen I've seen anthropology films
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:38.640]  made in the 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s I'm really into it I took it in college
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:44.360]  where they would land anywhere aborigines in in Australia Africans in
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:49.520]  Africa you know native Indians groups in South America they would beg for the
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:53.880]  medicine men to check their kids out and give them medicine they'd come to get a
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:59.080]  broken leg fixed and the well-meaning doctors in the Peace Corps you know came
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:05.200]  but now all over the world the villagers whether it's in Asia or Africa run and
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:09.160]  then that was in the CBS article they're like it's unfortunate that they gave
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:13.120]  them live polio and it's spreading worldwide because it adds to the myth
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:16.840]  the government did this folks do you really believe that in some African
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:22.280]  countries half the women or more have HIV they had a BBC study a decade ago
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:27.360]  finding it's funny the these women had some of these young girls have not had
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:33.880]  sexual relations they've been medically examined their hymen is still in place
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:39.040]  and they have HIV and they've been medically examined they've not been
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:44.200]  penetrated the other way and they said oh it must be that the the the aid workers
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:48.680]  are using the same needle over and over again and it turned out that wasn't the
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:53.960]  case it's in the vaccines I'm gonna say it again it's in the vaccines people say
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:58.440]  well why is it so bad in Africa I've had medical doctors on it's on record my
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:02.320]  dad who's a dentist had read this in the medical literature in the 80s and was
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:06.120]  telling me about it and it was all the big news everybody was scared he said
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:09.720]  no he said it's probably very specific this is my dad when I was in high school
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:14.160]  it's probably in junior high then in the early 80s he explained that the
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:17.800]  coupler points on the virus and later that was in the news and my dad sits
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:20.880]  around reading medical journals that's what he's into he's a bookworm kind of
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:25.080]  like my son is I guess kind of like I am but even more so and he said it doesn't
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:34.320]  have the virus doesn't it's designed for it's designed for a Negro but it'll
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:40.400]  also affect people of color and basically the cell ports northern Europeans
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:47.480]  especially do not have the cell ports do do not have the the the coupler points
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:50.200]  and I'm just going from what he told me I don't know all the specifics but I've
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:55.800]  read it later for the virus to even plug in and people usually say well I knew a
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:27:00.160]  white guy died of HIV and I'll say let me guess they were gay they had thousands
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:04.280]  of sexual partners and they use hard drugs and they're like yeah how did
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:08.560]  you know that because if you've used a ton of bad methamphetamine or other
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:12.320]  drugs that have been cooked up and have all the toxins in it it gives you an
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:16.600]  already an autoimmune disease and then you don't have T lymphocytes and
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:22.400]  sometimes a northern European can get HIV if you get a giant blood transfusion
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:31.120]  you can get HIV if you're Anglo it's a weapon to kill black people period let's
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:35.560]  say that again and you know what I'm going to do whole newscast on I know
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:39.920]  it's all you I tend to I tend to things I covered 10 15 years ago at nauseam to
[02:27:39.920 --> 02:27:43.160]  never really get back into it or just talk about it briefly because well I
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:47.080]  know about it then you should know about it no I mean I got our audience is a
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:51.200]  hundred times what it was 16 years ago I need to go back over all these basics
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:54.920]  here so and show you the documents just like I showed you last week the
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:59.200]  Rockefeller Foundation documents to put steroids in vaccines this is not a game
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:06.640]  this is not a game okay let's go ahead and go back to Alex to Colorado you got
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:09.800]  about two minutes for the he was on earlier at the first little five minute
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:13.120]  segment so your mom's a medical doctor she's making fun of you why don't you
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:18.760]  give her the Rockefeller documents on adding steroids to vaccines yeah I will
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:24.520]  definitely I wanted to go back to a little fact as well in 1959 77.5 of
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:29.160]  paralytic polio victims received the vaccine so they're hearing before the 87th
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:36.160]  Congress in 1962 so also a lot of credence to what you're saying well no I
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:39.040]  mean if you just I've got all the documents you I mean you can type in
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:42.480]  when I said about the Rockefellers well that was one program to add
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:46.000]  steroids the other was a vaccine that actually sterilizes your reduces
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.680]  fertility they got a whole class of them and they started it in the 60s by the
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:53.800]  80s they have the report saying well we've produced it now time to use it
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:59.840]  but you can pull up the you can pull up US government documents on numbers of
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:05.360]  Americans infected by SV 40 and you'll get the photo copies US Congressional
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:12.040]  reports 100 million who contracted what were rare cancers that killed them 100
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:16.520]  million devastating New World Order op most people listening have a family
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:21.320]  member killed by the globalist just through the polio weapon system anything
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:25.680]  else sir I know I said you said you had one more point that's why I hold you
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:34.160]  over oh um about all right I was talking about that they wouldn't believe me but
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:38.680]  you can show them the majority of the EPA and FDA scientists going to Congress
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:42.080]  and saying I mean you can give them BBC saying it's sevenfold increase in bone
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:46.560]  cancer will they not look at that information I'm sure they just go back
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:51.960]  to their emotional response so I know wow incredible we're on the March the

[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:31.960]  it's easy to find those boxes to watch the shows there as well okay so if three
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:36.280]  and a half million people watched our Bilderberg coverage on just Justin TV
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:40.640]  when Aaron and Paul were over in over in Switzerland can you imagine what's
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:44.600]  going to happen with this with a 24-hour plus transmission if everybody
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:48.600]  gets this link out to folks we could have a million viewers on top of our 3
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:52.360]  million listeners and viewers if people spread this link out to everyone they
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:59.440]  know okay I got really angry about this at the beginning of the first hour
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:06.480]  because during the break I saw Eric Holder, Napolitano and others again
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:10.720]  lying and saying they never knew about Fast and Furious about any gun running and
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:14.200]  Paul Watson is doing an article on this right now when they're on record with
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:20.160]  press conferences 09 and 010 with Holder in Texas I remember I remember
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:24.000]  reading the article and Paul's found it and is about to do an article on it at
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:29.160]  info wars.com and he said yeah you know he blamed the Second Amendment for
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:32.680]  Mexico's problems and said because we're tracking the guns into Mexico and our
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:37.160]  program Fast and Furious and now all the memos have come out but we have the
[02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:44.400]  videos of this so now they've gone back to Congress and said well my deputy knew
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:50.560]  but I didn't know when he's been caught in the White House is running it and it
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:57.520]  gets into so many other areas but it crick in my neck it gets into so many
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:01.000]  other areas in the Sinaloa drug cartel case with the feds of declared national
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.920]  security and aren't denying that they gave Sinaloa the power to ship unlimited
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:09.160]  cocaine in and to ship guns to them I mean I mean this is incredible this is
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:13.680]  about controlling the drugs this is a war over the drugs and then they just
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:17.440]  wanted to backhand the Second Amendment and blame us for the carnage in Mexico
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:22.680]  well needless to say this is blown up in their face but I wanted to bring these
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:28.080]  crux down not just Obama but the entire criminal system eight agencies involved
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:32.560]  in this this people who say they wouldn't stage 9 11 or wouldn't finance and
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:38.240]  protect the terrorist bare minimum this is killed more than 9 11 these guns now
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:43.320]  they're saying 60,000 dead on in Mexican TV and Mexican newspapers our media says
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:50.440]  40,000 plus in in three years I mean this is this is serious business and now
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:54.400]  it's spilling over here and killing citizens cops border patrol you name it
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:59.260]  there's another article out of the examiner operation
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:06.960]  armist crusades DHS or arm crusaders DHS and Apollo Thanos own Mexican gun
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.600]  trafficking program so now they're spinning it saying well we did talk
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:14.560]  about gun-running programs but those are other ones we have see it's just all
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:18.720]  part of a giant program so we didn't purge ourselves on Fast and Furious and
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:25.720]  Project gun-runner we have other ones yeah you bet it's a full-on war now we've
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:33.080]  got a clip coming up of David W. Ogden he was the deputy Attorney General and
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:37.320]  with him in the press conference is the Apollo Tana but that's coming up this is
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:43.320]  in 09 admitting all of this okay and then and then we have a clip we're gonna
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:49.040]  play first of her last week before Congress saying she doesn't know anything
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:53.040]  about this and never did and we've got her in stinking press conferences and I
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:56.600]  know there's memos that that show they were running it and we're in full
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:01.320]  command under her orders and holders but the video that no one can argue with
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:06.560]  this though they're saying they knew nothing I know nothing as Sergeant
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:11.160]  Schultz would say I love to imitate him about gun-running period and tracing it
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:16.920]  here she is caught but here she is first being grilled last week you learn of
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:21.920]  Fast and Furious for the first time I learned of it after the death of agent
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:28.200]  Terry and when did you learn that gun walking was part of Fast and Furious I
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:36.240]  would say sometime between his death and the early spring to your knowledge is
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:40.160]  ever has anyone ever communicated or did anyone communicate with Mexican
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:44.800]  authorities that guns were being allowed to cross our border into Mexico in
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:51.200]  contravention of their gun laws I can only speak for communications that I
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:54.400]  know of and I know of no such communications so someone at the
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:59.200]  Department of Justice had to know about Fast and Furious for the T3 to ever
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:03.680]  have been approved correct I just can't comment I don't know that there was a
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:08.480]  T3 approved in Fast and Furious if there were a T3 approved in Fast and
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:12.560]  Furious and and there were the Department of Justice what had to have
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:17.120]  known about it correct I'm gonna leave that for your own investigation sir I'm
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:22.760]  just not gonna comment or go beyond what I know and what I know is that after the
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:30.320]  death of agent Terry if the Fast and Furious label became a parent and we
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:35.000]  became knowledgeable about it obviously there were problems with the operation
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:38.840]  obviously it did not succeed let's stop right there vector general she gets
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:42.040]  shoot out even more it's it's up at prison planet TV you want to see the full
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:47.320]  report now notice she said we became aware of the Fast and Furious label
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:52.680]  they're playing games and now they come out today confirming that going oh we
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:58.520]  were running all of this we were running all of this it's just we had a
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:02.440]  different name for it oh we were running guns and actually giving them to a
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:08.680]  that was a different name oh see she's playing mind games here like Bill
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:14.800]  Clinton said well you lied about you know is he was well depends on what is is
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:21.720]  con artist behavior mind games and we're trained at love mind games so we
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:28.400]  like oh good good then we've got several clips one of one of David W. Ogden the
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:32.040]  deputy attorney general and then she's behind him while he's speaking about the
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:36.080]  gun-running program that she didn't know about until a couple years later this is
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:40.040]  from 2009 I know in the newscast we had the date let's go ahead and play that
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:45.200]  clip DOJ's Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives is increasing
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:49.320]  its efforts by adding 37 new employees in three new offices using ten million
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:53.160]  dollars in recovery act funds and redeploying 100 personnel to the
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:58.160]  southwest border in the next 45 days to fortify its project gun runner which is
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:02.600]  aimed at disrupting arms trafficking between the United States and Mexico
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:09.840]  ATF is doubling its its presence in Mexico itself from five to nine personnel
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:14.880]  working with the Mexican specifically to facilitate gun tracing activity which
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:18.960]  targets these guys are too cowardly to go to Mexico this is in the United States
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:26.480]  the oh look it pause for a minute please now now yeah yeah back it up some now
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:29.840]  now again they've also perjured and said they don't anything about project gun
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:34.160]  runner now now there is the deputy attorney general talking about project
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:42.760]  gun runner with mr. Napolitano excuse me cousin it right behind him and then she
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:48.560]  comes over to talk about it this is 2009 and Paul Watson has an article on it
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:53.240]  what was the headline agenda Paul a tonneau caught a big sis caught perjuring
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:56.360]  herself he's got the dates and everything in there in the article from last
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:59.760]  week she got a new one coming out today with the latest perjury but but go back
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:05.480]  to the clip now now she totals over the person funding street lights that listen
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:09.680]  to you the person that has homeland security sticking their hands down your
[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:13.640]  children's pants the the person who ships tens of thousands of guns to drug
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:19.360]  cartels and gives them authorization to bring cocaine in she now totals over
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.800]  remember I just showed you the clip where she knew nothing oh but that was last
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:29.000]  week a couple years ago she did here it is the illegal weapons and their sources
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:36.920]  in the United States and then again you see that she's with him there and then
[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:40.480]  there's the question now go to the other clip of her in the same press conference
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:45.520]  that's the last clip he and then we have a still shot of the actual article that
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:50.920]  Paul wrote about this we can tell people about that in closing here here she is
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:57.880]  at that press conference in 2009 bragging about project gun runner here it is but
[02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:01.320]  our department has a very broad mission and we have to be able to multitask
[02:45:01.320 --> 02:45:06.760]  destroying America and as we multitask one of the things that has happened one
[02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:10.720]  of the changes in the threat environment has been what is going on in
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:21.640]  Mexico several things one is first of all you've got to
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:26.720]  interdict the arms you got to stop them from going into Mexico we're coordinating
[02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:31.240]  with Mexico because they can do more by way of southbound screening on their
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:35.720]  side of the border but then the Department of Justice moving their
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:41.560]  agents down there as David said in increasing tracing that will help us
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:47.920]  identify who are who who was putting those arms into the arms both those guns
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:55.640]  into the arms of the traffickers moving south and out of that there can
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:46:00.640]  recently we've seen more prosecution of actual arms dealers who are intentionally
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:06.160]  and knowingly putting arms into the hands of the smugglers so that is part you
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:11.280]  know she sounds like she's on something I mean I I've just been around women
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:14.960]  that are pill poppers and that's the a talk by shat I mean maybe that's just
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:23.360]  how she talks I mean just what a what a disgusting blob what a disgusting filthy
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:28.280]  enemy of America shipping guns into Mexico and of course the North American

[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:29.680]  news and it's actually in my stack and I'm so flipped out about about secret
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:33.160]  streetlight microphones listening to us all over the country that I'm just I

[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:51.320]  nightmare over I you know I I am I'm a trader I trade their you know futures
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:55.160]  contracts and I listen to the to the news and I heard I come across the wire
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:50:00.840]  this morning I couldn't believe it and you know they're just doing everything
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:08.320]  they can to to you know observe the will of the people well I mean I mean my
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:13.840]  view is preliminary Greece is actually saying no to the globalist before they
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:16.640]  totally give up what's left of their sovereignty and go into this debt slave
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:19.880]  deal kind of like Germany in the Versailles treaty what's your view of
[02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:26.640]  it absolutely I think that it's it's coming to a head over there and they're
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:31.480]  getting scared I think the globalist are in the bank the banking mafia over
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:35.480]  there is just shaking in their boots because if they know that if Greece
[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:39.640]  implodes and they default a hundred percent that's going to trigger those
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:44.520]  TDS's and you know stay there it's only five minutes overdrive so we get all
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:48.360]  the other colors but you know that's what's so crazy why do the globalist

[02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:04.360]  orderly coup a counter coup against the banker Goldman Sachs coup where they
[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:07.840]  put their people in as the finance minister the president popping dry off
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:12.000]  by the whole thing I mean because again a hundred billion the Greek so most of
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:15.080]  it isn't even their dad's derivatives the government has signed them on to
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:19.000]  bankers derivatives and now Europe just passed a 1.4 trillion rescue package
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:22.520]  for a hundred billion and is going to leverage it to five trillion Bob
[02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:26.240]  Shabin says four and a half trillion Kaiser says five trillion it's different
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:31.280]  numbers in the news hidden in the news but the point is it's not Greece's debt
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:37.960]  just like Iceland said no and the and you don't pay this and then get out of it
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:43.160]  it gets worse so finish up your point John from South Carolina yeah I mean

[03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:01.240]  hate to say it but it looks like a bunch of homeless people set up in town not
[03:01:01.240 --> 03:01:05.200]  looking so hot and then so I'm going back from Oakland because we were in
[03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:09.880]  San Jose we drove by the Oakland Coliseum and they've got a great big huge
[03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:14.640]  billboard up it's about 20 feet by 20 feet and the sign reads it's an
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:18.360]  advertisement for a restaurant but not going to do that but it says
[03:01:18.360 --> 03:01:24.200]  star of a country rate a nation and this is just like three or four miles from
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:27.800]  the occupied thing but that was kind of an interesting thing to see on a
[03:01:27.800 --> 03:01:31.680]  billboard it's kind of play you know you know it's an advertisement it's still
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:38.040]  kind of a oddball thing the other thing is last year my wife and myself were on
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:43.040]  our property in Northwest Arkansas and this is private property it's marked we
[03:01:43.040 --> 03:01:48.160]  have three private gates and over a mile of dirt road we have a process server
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:53.480]  come on the property service and papers were on the little minor thing anyway
[03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:58.000]  while the guy was on the property asking how he got through the gate he didn't
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:02.640]  respond so I walked past his car to go and check one of the gates the guy
[03:02:02.640 --> 03:02:09.880]  jumps in his car and backs into me I call the police the cops respond walk up
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:13.560]  to the guy shake his hands and say hey Doug how are you doing they ended up and
[03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:19.120]  I'm I'm I had just broken my collarbone the day before actually they arrested me
[03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:22.960]  for assaulting this guy which I had all I did was call the cops because he hit
[03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:27.600]  me with his car they videotaped their own thing they kicked my door down and
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:32.640]  arrested my whole family who had nothing at all to do with this we took them to
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:38.800]  court and after eight months of waiting to go to court our lawyer which cost me
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:45.280]  $3,000 said in the end I'm gonna go home you may go to jail so the best thing to
[03:02:45.280 --> 03:02:50.760]  do is we'll just kind of deal and get out of here so you don't know the good
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:56.240]  government is now by and large insane power-tripping criminals who think
[03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:00.880]  they're invincible we're gonna fall just like Mexico we're gonna implode in a
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:06.000]  just lawless bedlam it was pretty incredible and I have one other little
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:11.840]  weird thing to say we heard through weird channels that some friends some
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:16.720]  people that we know went through a TSA checkpoint where they did the hands down
[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:21.520]  their pants thing and these guys were ready for they had put chunky peanut
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:26.120]  butter in their underwear I appreciate your call that's just too much that's
[03:03:26.120 --> 03:03:30.480]  that's hilarious that's off I've heard of stuff like that there's actually a
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:35.280]  joke that a comedian does about that let's go ahead and go to James in
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:48.680]  California go ahead one thing I wanted to talk about of course I honor you for
[03:03:48.680 --> 03:03:52.680]  your work and everything but yesterday you were talking about the mass
[03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:57.640]  hypnosis things something a little more individual I was experienced I
[03:03:57.640 --> 03:04:07.200]  experienced back in 1985 I happened to be paralyzed from a spinal injury and I
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:12.680]  was seeing a doctor who had told me he was involved with a gentleman from the
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:21.840]  military and had learned hypnosis what this relates to is to make a long story
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:27.840]  short is how we do not hear about any of the people who possibly had something
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:37.360]  to do with rigging the World Trade Center for collapse basically I was did
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:42.640]  this deep hypnosis and wound up getting control of my muscle spasms that I have
[03:04:42.640 --> 03:04:49.040]  left over from my injury and actually walked down a flight of stairs incredible
[03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:52.640]  I know hypnosis you know that the that's the big secret the Olympic athletes
[03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:56.600]  last few decades is hypnosis build it you know the body can live like twice
[03:04:56.600 --> 03:05:00.440]  what it thinks it can great points I'm sorry right of time see you back
