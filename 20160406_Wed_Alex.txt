[00:00.000 --> 00:21.040]  Ladies and gentlemen we are live we are broadcasting worldwide today I'm your
[00:21.040 --> 00:24.600]  host Alex Jones I have a very special report I want to air first off straight
[00:24.600 --> 00:30.680]  up on this Wednesday the sixth day already of April 2016 transmission by
[00:30.680 --> 00:34.960]  John Bowne his reports are so important ISIS Supreme Commander Hillary
[00:34.960 --> 00:40.440]  Clinton lectures America on ISIS obviously they put the full power of
[00:40.440 --> 00:44.880]  the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and the establishment in a huge
[00:44.880 --> 00:51.320]  way against Donald Trump and he lost to Ted Cruz in Wisconsin they're trying to
[00:51.320 --> 00:55.080]  create a meme now this is the fall of Donald Trump and the fall of populism
[00:55.080 --> 00:59.160]  we've got Roger Stone joining us in the second hour today to break down what's
[00:59.160 --> 01:03.920]  really happening and a lot more but first the John Bowne report and then
[01:03.920 --> 01:09.920]  we'll get into incredible over-the-top political correctness at a new level so
[01:09.920 --> 01:16.120]  get ready for that they've created ISIS Hillary Clinton created ISIS with
[01:16.120 --> 01:22.960]  Obama he is becoming ISIS's best recruiter they are going to people
[01:22.960 --> 01:29.000]  showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.720]  recruit more radical jihadists Hillary Clinton would have us all forget about
[01:33.720 --> 01:38.680]  the failed regime changes she oversaw in Egypt and Libya that led up to the
[01:38.680 --> 01:43.600]  stage rollout of Benghazi as an actual Marine Sergeant pointed out to Bill
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.400]  Clinton on the campaign trail back in February eight-year back-to-duty service
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.320]  two tours direct I had the 31 I had seven that were killed six wouldn't be on
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.040]  return and I have met with many of these gold star parents and family so I've
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.520]  seen them what do you think I've seen them warrant and the thing is that we
[02:02.520 --> 02:06.360]  had four lives in Benghazi that were killed and your wife tried to cover it
[02:06.360 --> 02:13.240]  up Benghazi now commonly known as a bungled covert operation nothing less
[02:13.240 --> 02:19.200]  than a CIA arms transfer of Gaddafi's pilfered arsenal to ISIS Hillary's
[02:19.200 --> 02:25.000]  accusations of Trump now being somehow responsible for ISIS are on their face
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.080]  laughable the way Donald Trump talks about terrorism and his you know very
[02:31.080 --> 02:35.840]  insulting language toward Muslims is making him the recruiting sergeant for
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.560]  ISIS in January of this year Soros dropped eight million dollars to boost
[02:40.560 --> 02:45.520]  Hillary's sluggish campaign while we are all overwhelmed and diverted by the
[02:45.520 --> 02:49.960]  ISIS chaos the New World Order bankers extend their tentacles into their
[02:49.960 --> 02:54.840]  customers bank accounts worldwide as zero hedge reports WikiLeaks has now
[02:54.840 --> 02:59.600]  verified what former head of the Bank of England Mervin King admitted one month
[02:59.600 --> 03:03.560]  ago when he said that Europe's economic depression is the result of
[03:03.560 --> 03:10.800]  deliberate policy choices made by EU elites it is also what AIG bank strategist
[03:10.800 --> 03:15.680]  Bernard Connolly said back in 2008 when laying out what Europe wants the
[03:15.680 --> 03:19.600]  evidence is staggering as WikiLeaks published the transcript of a
[03:19.600 --> 03:25.360]  teleconference that took place on March 19 2016 between the top two IMF
[03:25.360 --> 03:30.080]  officials in charge of managing the Greek debt crisis Paul Thompson the head
[03:30.080 --> 03:36.160]  of IMF's European department and Delia Velkulescu the IMF mission chief for
[03:36.160 --> 03:41.360]  Greece the IMF officials say that a threat of an imminent financial catastrophe
[03:41.360 --> 03:46.320]  as the Guardian puts it is needed to force other players into accepting its
[03:46.320 --> 03:52.160]  measures such as cutting Greek pensions and working conditions or as Bloomberg
[03:52.160 --> 03:58.120]  puts it considering a plan to cause a credit event in Greece and destabilize
[03:58.120 --> 04:02.520]  Europe under the banner of the globalist soft war through the terror of
[04:02.520 --> 04:07.280]  ISIS Europe is gradually being forced into total submission while many
[04:07.280 --> 04:11.080]  Americans bitterly cling to their blind ignorance in the face of an upcoming
[04:11.080 --> 04:24.400]  storm respect the fact is we had four dead Americans was it because of a
[04:24.400 --> 04:27.840]  protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night or decided they'd go
[04:27.840 --> 04:33.240]  kill some Americans what difference at this point does it make it is our job
[04:33.240 --> 04:37.280]  to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.520]  ever happening again senator as ISIS Brigadier General Hillary Clinton
[04:41.520 --> 04:45.840]  lectures the home of the brave and the land of the free the average American
[04:45.840 --> 04:52.440]  citizen is genuinely insulted John bound for info wars.com another

[05:06.960 --> 05:11.320]  host Carol Costello abruptly ended a segment Tuesday after a guest brought
[05:11.320 --> 05:17.200]  up Hillary Clinton's 1975 legal defense of an accused child rapist appearing on
[05:17.200 --> 05:21.360]  CNN newsroom with Carol Costello on Tuesday Newsmax Steve Malzburg who
[05:21.360 --> 05:25.040]  supports Donald Trump said when you get one-on-one especially if it's Hillary
[05:25.040 --> 05:28.680]  Donald Trump will go places nobody is willing to go bringing up Clinton's
[05:28.680 --> 05:32.800]  women who say they were intimidated by Hillary having them come forward and
[05:32.800 --> 05:37.640]  speak that's one of the issues but you also have to remember the Bacha boys in
[05:37.640 --> 05:42.440]  Afghanistan when I was in Afghanistan she sanctioned child rape and let it
[05:42.440 --> 05:46.960]  happen she didn't care Hillary Clinton is pure or evil and Hillary Clinton's
[05:46.960 --> 05:50.440]  crying in wine and saying she's had enough of Bernie Sanders guess what

[06:58.920 --> 07:04.440]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would
[07:04.440 --> 07:08.400]  hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to
[07:08.400 --> 07:14.280]  organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[07:14.280 --> 07:19.840]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but
[07:19.840 --> 07:23.800]  in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[07:23.800 --> 07:28.800]  pathogens added to the food and water to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[07:28.800 --> 07:33.760]  vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death I
[07:33.760 --> 07:39.440]  personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with

[07:50.320 --> 07:54.520]  many heads today it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and
[07:54.520 --> 07:59.280]  it starts at info wars life.com with Anthroplex
[08:00.880 --> 08:07.160]  born upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[08:07.160 --> 08:14.520]  tyranny over the mind of man Thomas Jefferson it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[08:14.520 --> 08:17.520]  radio network
[08:20.240 --> 08:28.520]  April 6th 2016 on this Wednesday worldwide broadcast the private run for
[08:28.520 --> 08:33.120]  profit Federal Reserve that got its economic beachhead in New York City in
[08:33.120 --> 08:38.920]  1913 has now basically taken over the United States and almost the entire
[08:38.920 --> 08:46.680]  world with its economic fraud you got to hand it to those far foreign central
[08:46.680 --> 08:52.440]  banks and those foreign Robert Barron families they know how to conquer a
[08:52.440 --> 08:59.400]  country by stealth coming up today we are going to have the aftermath and we're
[08:59.400 --> 09:06.400]  going to look forward into the future I talked to Roger Stone a few weeks ago
[09:06.400 --> 09:10.760]  and he said that he thought Trump would lose Wisconsin because the whole power
[09:10.760 --> 09:15.320]  structure was lining up against him there in the brainwashing campaign to
[09:15.320 --> 09:22.760]  end all brainwashing campaigns he also three months before Trump lost Iowa told
[09:22.760 --> 09:28.880]  me privately that he thought that was the case and last night he predicted
[09:28.880 --> 09:33.960]  yesterday afternoon to me on the phone exactly what the lost numbers would be I
[09:33.960 --> 09:38.680]  don't know how much of this inside baseball he'll get into on air but man I
[09:38.680 --> 09:43.400]  wish I wish I could tell you all the stuff that Roger Stone tells me that
[09:43.400 --> 09:50.920]  guy is amazing and what's coming up at the convention this year in Cleveland
[09:50.920 --> 09:55.080]  we're gonna be there I'm gonna bring as much of the crew as I can but it's so
[09:55.080 --> 09:58.640]  important obviously to run info wars here in Austin Texas David Knight's gonna
[09:58.640 --> 10:03.080]  be co-hosting here I'm gonna be there for at least a week probably more because
[10:03.080 --> 10:08.240]  this is going to be the open attempt steal the popular vote from the American
[10:08.240 --> 10:13.720]  people the RNC is back on national television openly saying they are going
[10:13.720 --> 10:19.240]  to select someone probably not even Cruz or casing another top Republican
[10:19.240 --> 10:23.880]  Karl Rove said this last week but another top Republican said oh well we may
[10:23.880 --> 10:28.400]  select casing so we're gonna be taught here that isn't about our popular vote
[10:28.400 --> 10:34.080]  now it's about the king makers RNC chairman suggest case it could be picked
[10:34.080 --> 10:40.040]  as nominee Karl Rove and others say no we'll want a fresh face so we'll play
[10:40.040 --> 10:44.880]  all of those clips coming up this is really the curtain being pulled back in
[10:44.880 --> 10:54.080]  a big big way also finally NBC News Reuters associated press four days
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.240]  after I made this point just pointing out that the mainstream media is the
[10:58.240 --> 11:04.040]  lagging stumbling brachiosaurus of the dinosaurs falling into the dustbin of
[11:04.040 --> 11:09.880]  history constantly Obama is now being asked and others are being asked in
[11:09.880 --> 11:15.120]  press conferences why are there no Americans out of tens of thousands of
[11:15.120 --> 11:24.840]  people listed in the Panama Papers there's another question and Wayne
[11:24.840 --> 11:30.240]  Madsen's written about this from four wars calm investigative journalist why
[11:30.240 --> 11:36.200]  will none of the Soros publications or pundits even talk about it well because
[11:36.200 --> 11:39.520]  when you're involved in something you don't want to draw attention to
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.400]  yourself it's come out the Rockefeller Foundation this is on record the
[11:44.400 --> 11:52.400]  Rockefeller Foundation the Carnegie Endowment the Ford Foundation and two
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.880]  of Soros's foundations have been running this data dump for two years with the
[11:56.880 --> 12:03.200]  media preparing it and within days it's falling flat on its face as a
[12:03.200 --> 12:09.200]  calculated system to go after legal offshore accounts of people with as
[12:09.200 --> 12:16.040]  little as $20,000 in them of course it's the biggest data dump in history the
[12:16.040 --> 12:21.840]  biggest theft of data hundreds of times bigger than wiki leaks because it's
[12:21.840 --> 12:28.240]  just provincial it's a giant slice and it vaguely is connected to the British
[12:28.240 --> 12:32.120]  Prime Minister's father and it's vaguely connected to this soccer player and oh
[12:32.120 --> 12:38.680]  my gosh we found an account of this European Prime Minister and when you
[12:38.680 --> 12:45.280]  go for a state planning and you got $50,000 a mainline lawyer when you're
[12:45.280 --> 12:48.480]  setting up a trust fund for your kids college we'll try to get you to put it
[12:48.480 --> 12:55.480]  offshore it's legal it's lawful but they act like it's all the pelican brief or
[12:55.480 --> 13:02.160]  something and it's totally illegal so remember the big megabanks have created
[13:02.160 --> 13:06.440]  2.2 quadrillion in the last decade or so it's really more than that in totally
[13:06.440 --> 13:10.760]  counterfeit fraudulent paper they fix the interest rates they fix the stock
[13:10.760 --> 13:19.280]  markets they fix the currency rates to the tune of trillions a day that's what
[13:19.280 --> 13:23.880]  the currency market is it's in the multi trillions and they're slicing
[13:23.880 --> 13:29.160]  billions off the top every day totally rigged they don't deny it
[13:29.160 --> 13:33.080]  I know people like Bob Chapman on 20 years ago talking about it and people
[13:33.080 --> 13:37.680]  roll their eyes since then it's rolling stone associated press headline
[13:37.680 --> 13:44.480]  everything is rigged for a select group and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the
[13:44.480 --> 13:48.200]  number one and number two funders of everything from Hillary Clinton to
[13:48.200 --> 13:54.760]  Barack Obama to Ted Cruz to the gun control groups the open borders the
[13:54.760 --> 14:00.280]  sponsors of all the ethnic culture events that aren't celebrate art
[14:00.280 --> 14:05.200]  literature this and that of black culture Hispanic culture Asian culture you
[14:05.200 --> 14:08.280]  go to these things we have a report coming out soon they just had the Bob
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.480]  Bullock Museum that had a whole section on the plan of San Diego and how it was
[14:12.480 --> 14:17.960]  a Chicano civil rights movement the Germans in World War one funded the
[14:17.960 --> 14:24.000]  Mexicans in Big Bend across the border to attack hundreds of people were
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.720]  killed and it was the plan of San Diego to kill all whites all white males
[14:30.720 --> 14:34.720]  above the age of 16 and I knew it was at Bob Bullock I actually saw it in the
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.760]  paper my friend Steve Mason kept trying to go down there it closed the other day
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.240]  that exhibit but he got some footage we're gonna show that to you but man
[14:42.240 --> 14:48.640]  that's I mean that's being celebrated at the Bob Bullock natural history Texas
[14:48.640 --> 14:54.240]  Museum the plan of San Diego I learned about the plan of San Diego like 18
[14:54.240 --> 14:57.040]  years ago out of the
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.000]  Mexican Independence Day parade they're always people wearing the plan of San
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.120]  Diego shirts and a Hispanic professor from UT said Alex you know what the plan
[15:06.120 --> 15:11.800]  of San Diego is because you might want to look into it and it's just crazy and
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.720]  again it's not the free Hispanics or free Mexico it's just to get us all
[15:15.720 --> 15:20.800]  fighting with each other but at the University of Texas they teach people
[15:20.800 --> 15:26.560]  that are in cultural studies the plan of San Diego is a good thing to kill the
[15:26.560 --> 15:30.360]  white people and and you go see the new Black Panther Party and the Black Lives
[15:30.360 --> 15:34.360]  Matter groups in countless videos saying we just be better off if all the whites
[15:34.360 --> 15:40.360]  were dead that's just classic genocidal garbage that every culture has engaged in
[15:40.360 --> 15:50.720]  against itself and others this is a human aberrant behavior and by the way I
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.880]  was against the World War one the Austrian Hungarian Empire did not start
[15:55.880 --> 15:59.880]  that the British started it they had a quote German problem because the Germans
[15:59.880 --> 16:03.720]  were outmaneuvering them with industry and free trade and defeating their Empire
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.080]  and the Dutch were upset about it a bunch of people were mad at the Austrian
[16:07.080 --> 16:12.840]  Hungarian Empire and Germania itself it was dominating economically but they had
[16:12.840 --> 16:18.720]  a very medieval military command it was high-tech very medieval the war cult
[16:18.720 --> 16:23.320]  and they just messed with the Germans so they got into that war people asked
[16:23.320 --> 16:26.960]  why would Mexico be allied with Germany and attack the United States in World
[16:26.960 --> 16:37.160]  War one because Germany went in there after the Spain left and took over for
[16:37.160 --> 16:44.280]  the Austrian Hungarian Empire and so again I've got so much news to cover and
[16:44.280 --> 16:48.960]  I'm digressing it's just frustrating to know history and to see the public not
[16:48.960 --> 16:55.400]  aware of history but just because England started just because the British
[16:55.400 --> 16:59.800]  Empire started a war with Germany to bring them down doesn't mean I support
[16:59.800 --> 17:06.400]  German operations to attack the United States so why are Americans not
[17:06.400 --> 17:12.480]  included in the Panama Papers NBC Night Nightly News ask we were asking that on
[17:12.480 --> 17:18.200]  Sunday because it's totally tailored to put the Anglo-American establishment in
[17:18.200 --> 17:21.600]  the driver's seat worldwide to extradite anybody they want including
[17:21.600 --> 17:25.600]  foreigners or the black bag American citizens that legally and lawfully take
[17:25.600 --> 17:30.120]  their money out of the US after tax money and try to protect themselves only
[17:30.120 --> 17:33.560]  big mega corporations are allowed to take their money offshore and be tax
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.400]  exempt and that's before tax money you can't take your after tax money and put
[17:38.400 --> 17:42.920]  it overseas because they can always find some ignorant federal grand jury more
[17:42.920 --> 17:48.280]  than happy to indict you one of the many remarkable things about the massive
[17:48.280 --> 17:52.560]  leak of documents known as the Panama Papers is what's so far been lacking
[17:52.560 --> 17:56.800]  Americans the documents related to Panamanian law firm that specializes
[17:56.800 --> 18:00.320]  in creating shell companies for many of the world's richest people proved a
[18:00.320 --> 18:03.480]  glimpse into how secret fortunes and ill-gotten gains are moved through a
[18:03.480 --> 18:06.400]  shadowy financial network according to the international Consortium
[18:06.400 --> 18:11.440]  investigative journalism the special consortium that you could the
[18:11.440 --> 18:15.120]  international consortium well if you just switch that international and

[23:58.320 --> 24:11.040]  I want to get into the election over-the-top brainwashing and political
[24:11.040 --> 24:16.920]  correctness and a lot more but first I was this morning driving into work
[24:18.960 --> 24:23.600]  well first off was another bizarre day I was out there hiking for about an hour
[24:23.600 --> 24:28.080]  this morning up and down these hills and Lance Armstrong is just running at full
[24:28.080 --> 24:32.240]  speed up and down the hills right where I'm at in the middle of nowhere keep
[24:32.240 --> 24:38.160]  running into Lance Armstrong and the guys just charging up and down like massive
[24:38.160 --> 24:43.080]  degree hills up and down like a mountain goat I don't know why I'm throwing that
[24:43.080 --> 24:47.640]  in there it was just part of my bizarre life hundreds of square miles of places
[24:47.640 --> 24:51.040]  and I go here it's Lance Armstrong I go there it's Lance Armstrong he must live
[24:51.040 --> 24:56.640]  down there anyways side issue I was thinking about it then but then I was
[24:56.640 --> 25:05.200]  also thinking about it driving into work that we're having our whole future
[25:05.200 --> 25:10.640]  stolen our destiny stolen I know I make that point a lot but man when they
[25:10.640 --> 25:14.640]  announced that okay there is little tech in all the new cars so the police can
[25:14.640 --> 25:18.040]  remote control your vehicle it's for your own good and when somebody runs from
[25:18.040 --> 25:24.560]  the cops we'll just disable their car I first read about that like 20 years ago
[25:24.560 --> 25:28.840]  and only select vehicles had it but police were starting to do it out in LA
[25:28.840 --> 25:32.920]  where the helicopter sends an order out to the car and there's a program already
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.280]  inside its ignition basically that turns the car off well it's way beyond that
[25:37.280 --> 25:41.280]  it's gonna tax us it's going to track us it's going to control us and we're just
[25:41.280 --> 25:46.560]  allowing this whole system to be built that controls every facet of our lives
[25:46.560 --> 25:53.320]  and is run by globalist that are anti-human and we know the smartphones
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.360]  and the iPads and the screen time dumps us down lowers our IQ hurts our
[25:57.360 --> 26:03.640]  relationships it's not healthy the way we're going it'd be one thing if we were
[26:03.640 --> 26:08.320]  rapidly evolving technologically and physically in some good direction we are
[26:08.320 --> 26:16.120]  devolving we are rotting we are falling apart and I love the right-wing fake
[26:16.120 --> 26:22.200]  Christian PC police as well if I use the word evolve or devolve they go there's
[26:22.200 --> 26:26.840]  no such thing as evolution I'm not debating Charles Darwin's evolution
[26:26.840 --> 26:31.040]  that the pop liberals don't cover properly and that you don't cover
[26:31.040 --> 26:38.840]  properly but no I don't believe in pop evolution and neither does the elite you
[26:38.840 --> 26:42.360]  might want to research what they actually believe even the New York Times is
[26:42.360 --> 26:48.560]  reported what the majority of scientists and genetic engineers believe and they
[26:48.560 --> 26:55.280]  have a word for it maybe I should not even say the name that'll make people
[26:55.280 --> 27:03.520]  want to go look it up but basically the movie Prometheus is their creation
[27:03.520 --> 27:10.520]  story that's what they believe I'm not saying that's necessarily what I believe
[27:10.520 --> 27:15.080]  I'm telling you what they believe they believed it since the time of Charles
[27:15.080 --> 27:20.600]  Darwin and then they teach you some pop garbage that they don't even believe but
[27:20.600 --> 27:25.880]  let me digress out of that the reason I was going down this road for the short
[27:25.880 --> 27:34.280]  segment is that whether you believe there are other entities and other
[27:34.280 --> 27:45.800]  dimensions aliens other worlds whatever you want to call it take the movie
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.720]  Pacific Rim cheesy fun movie to take ten-year-old kids to but at least the
[27:50.720 --> 27:55.640]  preface that we always thought life would come from space not from a
[27:55.640 --> 28:06.520]  interdimensional fracture in the Pacific Rim that just shows how we have to
[28:06.520 --> 28:11.520]  think outside the limited little box that we've been put in but but I'm not
[28:11.520 --> 28:15.680]  even saying that's what's going on the elite in their own words from Ray Kurz
[28:15.680 --> 28:20.600]  Weld do you name it say that they believe they're merging with machines to
[28:20.600 --> 28:24.760]  create the new Superman the uber mention and of course every time we start
[28:24.760 --> 28:30.960]  hearing about Superman and uber mention every time we start seeing that and
[28:30.960 --> 28:35.200]  hearing that look out government start massacring people because you're
[28:35.200 --> 28:41.120]  profane ugly stunted animals anyways according to them you know I love the
[28:41.120 --> 28:47.560]  1940s and 50s because almost everything you see in comic books at that time was
[28:47.560 --> 28:53.920]  it plagiarized but to a great extent was basically taken from Norse and Germanic
[28:53.920 --> 29:03.640]  legend and then superimposed onto mutant Superman man of steel Superman uber
[29:03.640 --> 29:09.840]  mention overrace superrace masterrace but by the time you know World War two
[29:09.840 --> 29:16.520]  rolls around Superman is battling Hitler and of course they admit all this to you
[29:16.520 --> 29:21.720]  they general public propaganda piece and the first new Superman man of steel
[29:21.720 --> 29:26.760]  where he's against eugenics but Zodd is for it he wants to kill everybody on
[29:26.760 --> 29:31.160]  Krypton and rebuild but then the planet blows up we can do that so he comes to
[29:31.160 --> 29:35.160]  earth is gonna kill everybody and then repopulate the earth with the uber
[29:35.160 --> 29:40.360]  mention and the establishment is just in your face telling you what they're gonna
[29:40.360 --> 29:44.440]  do to you and your family so I'm just here warning you okay that's all I'm
[29:44.440 --> 29:47.360]  getting that here we'll be back I'm gonna get into the election and more stay

[30:18.680 --> 30:23.800]  Foundation as well as George Soros Open Society Foundations has shown its slip
[30:23.800 --> 30:27.440]  by declaring that it will not make available the entire cache of hacked
[30:27.440 --> 30:33.320]  documents from the Panamanian law firm Mozac Fonseca instead ICIJ maintains
[30:33.320 --> 30:37.480]  that it does not want to expose sensitive information of innocent private
[30:37.480 --> 30:41.320]  individuals along with the public figures we have heard this type of language

[32:16.960 --> 32:20.840]  there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even
[32:20.840 --> 32:25.200]  keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine we drill down more than
[32:25.200 --> 32:30.000]  7,000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.560]  iodine on top of that we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling
[32:34.560 --> 32:39.120]  it is the purest cleanest strongest out there quite frankly I'm flattered that
[32:39.120 --> 32:43.440]  with the launch of survival shield Nathan iodine that major brands and major
[32:43.440 --> 32:46.600]  companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they
[32:46.600 --> 32:50.800]  have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have it is

[33:12.920 --> 33:18.240]  so much for joining us again finishing up with what I was covering last segment
[33:18.240 --> 33:22.760]  I'm not trying to be negative but I've made films on the subject they're free
[33:22.760 --> 33:28.600]  online like blueprint for global enslavement end game blueprint for
[33:28.600 --> 33:32.280]  global enslavement and so many others in their own words their own admissions
[33:32.280 --> 33:37.880]  you can go back to documentaries I made 17 18 years ago and watch them and like
[33:37.880 --> 33:44.760]  90% of it's come true and it didn't come true they had already made attested it
[33:44.760 --> 33:48.880]  they already had it they were announcing that they were going to be rolling it
[33:48.880 --> 33:58.800]  out and the end of the story tells you they mean business so now I see what
[33:58.800 --> 34:03.440]  they say they want to do next and I know they mean business and so I'm freaked
[34:03.440 --> 34:10.320]  out I mean it's like five years ago when Patras was head of the CIA he did an
[34:10.320 --> 34:14.040]  interview with wire magazine admitted no all new tech from washing machines to
[34:14.040 --> 34:18.640]  dryers your refrigerator to your smart watch will be tracked in real time we're
[34:18.640 --> 34:22.360]  going to watch and listen to you but don't worry it's AI computers doing it
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.720]  so if you're not a terrorist it won't flag it for a human don't worry what you
[34:26.720 --> 34:30.440]  having sex with your wife don't worry what it is we're not going to look at
[34:30.440 --> 34:34.840]  you with the algorithms unless you're a terrorist folks they fund al-qaeda and
[34:34.840 --> 34:40.320]  ISIS they are using all the data they're selling it to corner markets and to be
[34:40.320 --> 34:46.720]  ahead of trends where only select corporations can compete you go that's
[34:46.720 --> 34:50.000]  fine they'll know what we really want give it to us no they know what you want
[34:50.000 --> 34:56.900]  and figure out how to not give it to you it's mind control it's future prediction
[34:56.900 --> 35:05.120]  technology it's on record we told folks about stingray 16 years ago by name three
[35:05.120 --> 35:10.280]  years ago Mikhail Phelan made international news when he got the
[35:10.280 --> 35:19.640]  secret documents from the city there in Washington State Seattle where it was
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.160]  their own telephone towers everywhere calling it police communications what
[35:24.160 --> 35:28.720]  was really homeland security grabbing everyone's info cracking into your phones
[35:28.720 --> 35:37.640]  lifetime video audio fake transformers fake power poles fake light poles they
[35:37.640 --> 35:42.680]  were putting those up in 1998 in Austin Texas a listener sent us the federal
[35:42.680 --> 35:46.400]  register where they were spending millions to put it in it's in my film
[35:46.400 --> 35:52.040]  police state to the takeover what I'm getting at is we are far down this road
[35:52.040 --> 35:58.600]  far down and next they're coming with forced inoculations next they're
[35:58.600 --> 36:02.320]  coming with an economic collapse so bad most families have to live in government
[36:02.320 --> 36:07.240]  run dormitories like North Korea or Cuba North Korea and Cuba could have food
[36:07.240 --> 36:12.960]  and water and jobs humans are incredibly organized and ingenious and hard-working
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.760]  most Cubans now live in dormitories because they won't let you fix your
[36:16.760 --> 36:21.600]  house or have one they want you in a dormitory with a cot so your kids can't
[36:21.600 --> 36:30.400]  be kids they're raised by the state it's raising us like chickens the great
[36:30.400 --> 36:33.720]  leap forward the Cultural Revolution they're now going to do a high-tech
[36:33.720 --> 36:39.240]  version of that here underclaward and Piven underage into 21 all these are
[36:39.240 --> 36:44.520]  just plans that carry out the same domestication the same imprisonment
[36:44.520 --> 36:50.240]  you put Native Americans on reservations where had the British gotten that they
[36:50.240 --> 36:56.920]  done that in Ireland they done that in Scotland first look it up the German
[36:56.920 --> 37:01.560]  concentration camp comes from the American reservation and the American
[37:01.560 --> 37:08.400]  reservation comes from the British and a lot of times we do to others what's been
[37:08.400 --> 37:13.240]  done to us you know that Andrew Jackson who put millions of Native Americans in
[37:13.240 --> 37:18.600]  concentration camps and killed them you know his mother and brother both died in
[37:18.600 --> 37:25.720]  the British concentration camp when he was 11 and 12 took two years one of
[37:25.720 --> 37:31.280]  that one of them first his mom his dad had died previously he was in the
[37:31.280 --> 37:40.680]  Revolutionary War for five years from the age of 10 to 15 and he was in giant
[37:40.680 --> 37:44.320]  Indian Wars where he saw whole cities destroyed see we lost a lot of those
[37:44.320 --> 37:48.320]  early wars I'm not saying it's good what Jackson did I'm just saying think of the
[37:48.320 --> 37:52.960]  time he was in his mother and brother died in a concentration camp he saw
[37:52.960 --> 37:58.320]  almost everybody he knew killed by the natives after that point so he became
[37:58.320 --> 38:04.880]  their destroyer I'm just telling you where all this stuff comes from ladies
[38:04.880 --> 38:11.160]  and gentlemen you can look it up for yourself Hitler was fascinated with the
[38:11.160 --> 38:18.000]  West and with news articles reprinted from the 1860s and on that he would read
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.440]  for hours a day sometimes and modeled much of Nazi Germany and what he did
[38:22.440 --> 38:29.880]  off of what he read in serialized articles in the press much of it twisted
[38:29.880 --> 38:36.560]  and fictional much of his operation Barbarossa in Russia was tailored on the
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.160]  Indian Wars how to round up the Russians and other Slavs and kill them I don't
[38:41.160 --> 38:45.280]  mean to go off to history lesson I apologize it's just all so incredibly
[38:45.280 --> 38:51.360]  interesting isn't it and we're being put into an electronic concentration camp
[38:51.360 --> 38:54.640]  we're being made where we don't have our own jobs can't produce our own food and
[38:54.640 --> 39:00.040]  are totally dependent on the system and they admit that's their plan for heaven's
[39:00.040 --> 39:05.160]  sake let's not go down this road the average bureaucrats not your enemy the
[39:05.160 --> 39:09.360]  average cops not your enemy the average person working at a corporation's not
[39:09.360 --> 39:13.080]  your enemy they're compartmentalized they don't know what's going on they're
[39:13.080 --> 39:17.400]  scared they just want to have a future you've got to let them know going along
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.920]  with the system destroys your future you can go along with it halfway to survive
[39:22.920 --> 39:26.640]  at this point but be building alternatives while you legally and
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.640]  lawfully culture jam and sabotage the new world order and when enough people
[39:32.640 --> 39:38.080]  understand this and the lights come on collectively game over and by the way
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.240]  we're very close to that point it's why the enemy is full throwing their full
[39:42.240 --> 39:48.360]  power against the people right now worldwide I'm gonna get into the election
[39:48.360 --> 39:55.400]  news a lot more right now first I want to tell you guys this is a half eaten
[39:55.400 --> 40:00.880]  bottle because I take these every day at lunch DNA Force plus is back in stock
[40:00.880 --> 40:05.840]  but we rushed this in because it's been sold out for months and the new labeling
[40:05.840 --> 40:11.680]  isn't done so it will not say plus it will just note that it has another key
[40:11.680 --> 40:18.800]  enzyme ingredient acid that massively accelerates the uptake of the key
[40:18.800 --> 40:24.720]  ingredients that are in DNA Force it's the same strength of everything else the
[40:24.720 --> 40:29.520]  all-new DNA Force plus is back in stock a new powerful ingredient same price
[40:29.520 --> 40:34.280]  again an all-new ultra strength version of DNA Force is back in stock and in
[40:34.280 --> 40:37.840]  force life calm with a new powerful ingredient for the same price as
[40:37.840 --> 40:42.280]  original DNA Force read about the new ingredient in force life calm DNA Force
[40:42.280 --> 40:45.720]  has been sold out for months and we expect to quickly sell out of its limited
[40:45.720 --> 40:50.840]  shipment DNA Force is loaded with the patented bio PQQ with a huge dose of
[40:50.840 --> 40:55.440]  that which is back by 175 clinical studies and truly hard to secure it's
[40:55.440 --> 41:00.120]  like 12 to $14,000 a kilo for us this patented ingredient in DNA Force
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.640]  contains more potent antioxidant activity than vitamin C it's something
[41:04.640 --> 41:10.360]  like 400 cartons of blueberries and has been associated with nerve growth factor
[41:10.360 --> 41:13.800]  it's way beyond that we're just we're just not even going to say what we're
[41:13.800 --> 41:19.600]  allowed to say go research it for yourself look there's a reason why just
[41:19.600 --> 41:25.600]  one ingredient DNA Force causes and then cost so much money I say 12 to 14,000 a
[41:25.600 --> 41:29.940]  kilo but it's like over two kilos of batch so it's $30,000 per batch DNA
[41:29.940 --> 41:33.800]  Force is extremely hard to produce and when we run out we are often out of stock
[41:33.800 --> 41:41.320]  for months visit m4slife.com and get the all new DNA Force and m4slife.com again

[42:42.880 --> 42:46.440]  know it's budgeted in that you're going to be buying it at least one more time
[42:46.440 --> 42:50.280]  so we can afford to hold it back we can't afford to have a bunch of inventory
[42:50.280 --> 42:57.240]  sitting around here and these products are so hard to make so clean so pure so
[42:57.240 --> 43:02.360]  ridiculously high quality because we want to pass California standards that
[43:02.360 --> 43:06.120]  are basically made to not be able to pass it's very hard to pass them which we
[43:06.120 --> 43:10.800]  do so that's why it's hard to keep these type of products in stock we want to

[43:34.240 --> 43:39.880]  high-quality products and people liking them and using them and wanting to
[43:39.880 --> 43:42.680]  support what we're doing so I want to thank you all for your support you make

[43:51.200 --> 43:55.280]  Craigslist and add in the paper put up a billboard for the show or the station
[43:55.280 --> 44:00.680]  we're all in these stations are all in I'm all in this is a war money and energy
[44:00.680 --> 44:04.880]  must be spent in a war or we'll lose everything there's not a choice in my
[44:04.880 --> 44:08.920]  view and a lot of you know that and I want to thank you but others are on the
[44:08.920 --> 44:13.400]  fence Liberty is not a spectator sport this is for all the marbles there's no
[44:13.400 --> 44:17.800]  longer any doubt that we're being dominated and taken over it's a natural
[44:17.800 --> 44:21.280]  instinct to want to resist this tyranny and say no and I know you want to stand
[44:21.280 --> 44:26.480]  up so I'm saying let's redouble our efforts together and let's pray for God
[44:26.480 --> 44:31.680]  to give us guidance to direct us in what we should do and to ask for providence
[44:31.680 --> 44:36.320]  that's not mumbo jumbo folks history shows it my life I've experienced it
[44:36.320 --> 44:42.080]  ask God for providence ask God to make you a leader ask God to help you be
[44:42.080 --> 44:48.000]  straight and strong and have understanding and if you do it from a pure heart and
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.080]  not searching for power God will give you those opportunities it'll start
[44:52.080 --> 44:57.680]  popping up in your face every day it's it's it's it's it's it's amazing but
[44:57.680 --> 45:03.000]  it's got to be for the right reason with a pure heart and you got to be ready to
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.080]  be persecuted but I'm telling you you with a cheerful face go up against the
[45:08.080 --> 45:14.120]  persecution one door closes five other doors open it is amazing and you'll be
[45:14.120 --> 45:18.160]  fulfilled within yourself you'll never get fulfilled with Madison Avenue and
[45:18.160 --> 45:21.760]  Wall Street and the world that's why the more world you get the more you want
[45:21.760 --> 45:26.080]  because nothing will quench your thirst like being a good human who loves God
[45:26.080 --> 45:31.200]  and loves God's creation and is trying to help others now all I'm offering is the
[45:31.200 --> 45:36.080]  truth as they say in the matrix nothing more you have to understand that with
[45:36.080 --> 45:44.240]  discernment comes great sorrow but it's a sweet sorrow but I'm telling you people
[45:44.240 --> 45:49.080]  made a decision to be spiritually blind culturally blind they've decided to not
[45:49.080 --> 45:53.480]  know what's happening it's totally in your face now you start admitting things
[45:53.480 --> 45:58.400]  to yourself you start opening your eyes up to a wider world the universe is
[45:58.400 --> 46:07.280]  gonna flash into view like a hidden image that was always there empowerment
[46:07.280 --> 46:13.280]  and fulfillment is waiting for you but you've got to open the door God comes
[46:13.280 --> 46:20.760]  knocking but it's free will you got to open the door the world in this satanic
[46:20.760 --> 46:26.400]  system sneaks up tries to take your free will tries to deceive you and I'll tell
[46:26.400 --> 46:33.480]  you the Faustian truth here it's a lie that it's never too late to turn back as
[46:33.480 --> 46:36.880]  long as you want to turn back and have that thought it means you're not totally
[46:36.880 --> 46:41.760]  committed to evil you can go so far with free will as totally committing lock
[46:41.760 --> 46:45.640]  on the door throwing away the key and deciding you want to be evil that's the
[46:45.640 --> 46:50.120]  ultimate sin knowledge of good knowledge of God's promise knowledge of what you
[46:50.120 --> 46:55.160]  could do knowledge of experiencing the Holy Spirit and all the understanding
[46:55.160 --> 47:04.040]  comes with it downloading a little spark of God into your soul you experience
[47:04.040 --> 47:10.520]  that and then you reject it and say I know you are I know you're real I know
[47:10.520 --> 47:17.040]  it and I choose to go this way God does it damn you to hell you make the
[47:17.040 --> 47:21.920]  decision to flip that switch yourself you're the one that gets in the elevator
[47:21.920 --> 47:28.480]  and says take me to the bottom instead of take me to the top and when you get
[47:28.480 --> 47:33.520]  asked to go to the top you open up on that high-rise in a metaphysical way
[47:33.520 --> 47:37.760]  and a big old helicopter comes right down in lands and it's a next level you
[47:37.760 --> 47:41.720]  ready to get on the helicopter and then you get taken to a mountaintop and it
[47:41.720 --> 47:48.640]  goes from there up up up in through and beyond are you ready can you handle it
[47:48.640 --> 47:53.920]  or do you want your God to be sports and mainstream movies and TV and all this
[47:53.920 --> 48:00.880]  empty crap that question is up to you if you're ready to be fulfilled you're not
[48:00.880 --> 48:04.880]  gonna find it in these establishment churches you're gonna find it in
[48:04.880 --> 48:11.360]  admitting that God's real and that Jesus Christ was God in the flesh to
[48:11.360 --> 48:16.120]  experience what his creations were going through with a message to humanity
[48:16.120 --> 48:20.080]  that's why the whole world hates real Christians and hates that message and
[48:20.080 --> 48:25.280]  hate and the Pharisees hate it because they've twisted it and it's all meant
[48:25.280 --> 48:29.120]  to deceive you and destroy you I'm sorry I'm preaching I'm gonna stop right
[48:29.120 --> 48:33.160]  there and when I preach it's not on some moral high ground that I'm the perfect
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.880]  guy and boy I'm a good boy and I waited till I got married to have sex and I
[48:37.880 --> 48:44.120]  never spoke to marijuana cigarette and all that bull when I get up here and
[48:44.120 --> 48:47.480]  tell you what I've experienced it isn't to make me feel big like I'm some high
[48:47.480 --> 48:51.880]  priest and you're lowly you got to come to me for empowerment and enlightenment
[48:51.880 --> 48:58.760]  no you got to go to God for that and that's what these devil churches hate
[49:00.240 --> 49:06.440]  they're there to make you feel guilty and to serve them they become the
[49:06.440 --> 49:12.160]  accuser they become the deceiver all right I'm gonna stop I gotta get it look
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.520]  Trump lost in Wisconsin by a lot of points we knew that was coming they
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.320]  put their whole power against him with all the establishment people that listen
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.280]  to every talk radio show the Republican system and the Republican machine and the
[49:25.280 --> 49:29.040]  Democrat machine and all the rest of it to say that you know if you didn't win
[49:29.040 --> 49:32.040]  Wisconsin he'll lose the rest of the country to create a mind control
[49:32.040 --> 49:37.760]  perception that he's going down and if the public buys into that it just shows
[49:37.760 --> 49:44.000]  one more time they can fool people into quote wanting to bet on the winner just
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.280]  like Bernie Sanders is winning early states Hillary just stole the delegates
[49:47.280 --> 49:51.080]  created the perception he couldn't win so that then she would start winning but
[49:51.080 --> 49:54.320]  she's so unpopular she's starting to lose again so they're saying well we'll
[49:54.320 --> 49:58.440]  just take you know his delegates at the convention and Trump's way ahead still
[49:58.440 --> 50:02.080]  as well he's gonna win California he's gonna win New York he's still gonna win
[50:02.080 --> 50:07.100]  by a massive portion but they're creating the idea that it's okay for John
[50:07.100 --> 50:11.480]  Kasich to get it or maybe somebody with no delegates that's what they're all
[50:11.480 --> 50:17.840]  saying I have those clips when we come back Obama scolds Donald Trump on

[54:06.960 --> 54:11.360]  it comes to the Trump campaign and just calling it like it is not not saying
[54:11.360 --> 54:16.000]  the way he wants it to be but basically breaking down how it really is again
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.760]  thank you for joining us second third to fourth hour straight ahead first let me
[54:21.760 --> 54:26.160]  read some of these headlines Trump campaign calls Ted Cruz a Trojan horse
[54:26.160 --> 54:31.400]  after Wisconsin loss that's out of the week and they're saying he is a
[54:31.400 --> 54:35.000]  Republican establishment well absolutely they're even saying they're not gonna let
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.120]  him have it they're just gonna give it to Paul Ryan or Kasich I mean you talk
[54:38.120 --> 54:42.920]  about a shell operation and they say it on Fox and CNN and MSNBC to get
[54:42.920 --> 54:49.280]  everybody ready for it now we have a shock new national poll now this is
[54:49.280 --> 54:52.560]  questionable because all the other polls say the opposite takes the lead in
[54:52.560 --> 54:57.080]  Reuters poll Ted Cruz does over Donald Trump for the first time the first time
[54:57.080 --> 55:02.800]  Donald Trump hasn't led in the tracking poll in 2016 we'll talk about that with
[55:02.800 --> 55:08.280]  Roger Stone RNC chairman suggests Kasich could be picked as nominee even
[55:08.280 --> 55:13.080]  though he just has a fraction of what Donald Trump or Ted Cruz have Pierce
[55:13.080 --> 55:17.320]  Morgan's come out on the Michelle Field story saying anyone with a brain who
[55:17.320 --> 55:23.280]  thinks that this is an insult or an assault is living in cloud cuckoo land so
[55:23.280 --> 55:28.440]  even Pierce Morgan gets it right about that very very dangerous precedent right
[55:28.440 --> 55:35.160]  there but let's go ahead and go to this first clip Obama scolds Obama at a
[55:35.160 --> 55:42.840]  Freudian slip Obama scolds Trump Obama should be scolding himself being a
[55:42.840 --> 55:48.120]  communist organizer nobody just given all his jobs given all his power and
[55:48.120 --> 55:52.080]  saying Donald Trump doesn't know how the world works that's like Obama saying if
[55:52.080 --> 55:56.560]  you have a business you didn't build that or you can keep your doctor I mean
[55:56.560 --> 56:01.200]  just it's ridiculous let's go ahead and play this club first of all they're
[56:01.200 --> 56:05.800]  impractical we just talked about the difficulties of trying to enforce huge
[56:05.800 --> 56:12.280]  outflows of capital the notion that we're going to track every Western Union you
[56:12.280 --> 56:18.640]  know a bit of money that's being sent to Mexico you know good luck with that then
[56:18.640 --> 56:24.640]  we've got the issue of the implications for the Mexican economy which in turn if
[56:24.640 --> 56:28.840]  it's collapsing actually sends more immigrants north because they can't find
[56:28.840 --> 56:36.040]  jobs back in Mexico but this is just one more example of something that is not
[56:36.040 --> 56:41.600]  thought through and is primarily put forward for political consumption now
[56:41.600 --> 56:44.360]  let's go ahead there's two different responses from Donald Trump the second
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.600]  one he is really mad here's the first one Donald Trump responds to Obama's
[56:47.600 --> 56:52.880]  saying he doesn't know anything about the world he said you don't know much
[56:52.880 --> 56:56.840]  about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world
[56:56.840 --> 57:00.680]  generally what do you have to say to President Obama look I've been very
[57:00.680 --> 57:04.480]  critical because I happen to think he's incompetent as a president and I know
[57:04.480 --> 57:09.760]  more about nuclear than he will ever know in other words we are right now the
[57:09.760 --> 57:13.760]  policeman of the world we have 19 trillion in debt going to 21 trillion
[57:13.760 --> 57:18.720]  dollars in debt what's going on in this country is crazy we have a bubble we're
[57:18.720 --> 57:23.560]  sitting on top of a bubble and yet we're giving we're giving military
[57:23.560 --> 57:29.360]  protection to Japan and Germany and Saudi Arabia and South Korea and many
[57:29.360 --> 57:33.640]  many other countries I could keep stop there we because the ruling class has
[57:33.640 --> 57:37.880]  military control over those countries makes them take our factories and jobs
[57:37.880 --> 57:42.400]  because then our elite get the money deindustrializing us with a controlled
[57:42.400 --> 57:47.080]  market that's it Donald that they're occupied by the globalist that's why
[57:47.080 --> 57:51.480]  they won't get free military then our government gives North Korea the
[57:51.480 --> 57:56.040]  reactors to make the nuclear weapons to keep them hostage see there's the real
[57:56.040 --> 57:59.960]  geopolitical facts let's go ahead and go to Trump really mad about this here's
[57:59.960 --> 58:05.760]  the second clip did you hear Obama yesterday Obama yesterday started
[58:05.760 --> 58:13.040]  showing his tremendous disappointment at Iran for violating the deal I said I
[58:13.040 --> 58:18.960]  could have told you that five months ago you're so incompetent you are so
[58:18.960 --> 58:30.680]  totally incompetent as a president you are so incompetent I mean honestly he
[58:30.680 --> 58:35.320]  did honestly he doesn't have a clue folks we're going to break stay with us
[58:35.320 --> 58:38.320]  there's more behind that than incompetence I'll tell you in 70 seconds
[58:38.320 --> 58:47.480]  there's a lot more than that we'll be back visit GCN live.com today

[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:23.000]  segment Dr. Group on the mystery flu and more that's still going around in the
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:30.240]  third hour and in the fourth hour today we have host David Knight
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:38.600]  chaperoning that transmission I want to get into political speech control
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:44.960]  because there's an update DOJ agents have raided the home of the Planned
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:54.000]  Parenthood activist who coordinated some of the videos at CBS News Sacramento
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.120]  and we've seen a Texas grand jury indict some of the people that went in and
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:04.160]  showed clear fraud in my view clear breaking of the law but this is
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.320]  persecution of journalism people didn't know body parts were being sold there's
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.720]  laws against it they were violating all sorts of different laws and that's all
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.880]  come out but instead they want to keep this multi-billion dollar a year
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.760]  industry going they don't want women to know this is happening so these people
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.320]  are now being persecuted but look it just draws more attention to it it shows
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.280]  everybody what's going on in fact I have a whole stack dealing with political
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:33.720]  correctness and how it leads to arrest in its final phases gap apologizes for ad
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:43.400]  accused of racism because it shows four little girls and one of the white girls
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:50.240]  has her arm leaning on the black girl which just shows a form of friendliness
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.000]  and a way to balance out the scene but no no no that's that's that's that's
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.280]  covert brainwashing to teach people to just look for covert racism everywhere
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:06.640]  you go isn't that just cute by the way that's her adopted sister that's her
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.640]  adopted sister in real life too thank you CJ for reminding me of that were you
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:17.440]  on air just then yes I love it good come on air more that's why I've been
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.040]  begging them for years to do it I think a lot of great points in my ears
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.960]  sometimes I just wanted on air unless it's a really embarrassing mistake I've
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:27.400]  made or something we can do that off there but seriously I don't have people
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.320]  in my ear tell me what to do but they do help me out with names or facts or you
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.240]  know something that's coming up or I'm can't think of something half the time
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.560]  they pop in my head like I'm like who's that actor who's in such-and-such and
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.840]  they'll tell me but but just think about that where you're taught brown paper bag
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:48.000]  brown bag and then everyone politically correct you know in an office will then
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.520]  try to go around and and grovel to the quote minorities to make them feel secure
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.000]  when that only makes everybody feel creeped out I mean it's just totally
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.800]  uncomfortable totally weird and then gap apologizes we're sorry we didn't mean
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.000]  it like that but we're sorry for showing a family together and oh my gosh it's so
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  terrible no no no CNN host cuts off interview after guest mentions Hillary's
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.640]  defense of child rapist as a lawyer it's a fact they did it but you're not
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:24.560]  allowed to talk about her that way oh and of course folks have found other gap
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.040]  ads with a black girl putting her arm on the head of a little girl that's just
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.880]  meant to balance out the scene and show they're all comfortable with each other
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:39.880]  and friendly but you see and the black girl has a shirt that says epic but she's
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:44.360]  the center of the piece she's the old cool kid who they're targeting you want
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.320]  to be the cool kid wear this and all the other kids will flock around you that's
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.440]  the real manipulation but instead it's racism just so you're just looking for
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:58.200]  the codes everywhere like a schizophrenic basket case loon here's another one BBC
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.720]  reports China's great firewall blocks its creator the designer of China's great
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.120]  firewall has been mocked online after he reportedly had to bypass the censorship
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.200]  system and he helped create during a public event where he was down there
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.720]  pushing it and these guys work with Zuckerberg to help censor us it's all
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:19.920]  one big happy family Planned Parenthood David Dalladin I think his name speaks
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:26.160]  out on his home being raided undercover investigators home in California was
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.800]  raided by officials under the office of California Attorney General's office I
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.000]  team Port Authority cops say surprise terror drills pose danger to officers
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.320]  we're gonna get into some of that more censorship raised hands in England raise
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:46.000]  in your hand to ask a question violates safe space policy not allowed to walk
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.600]  not allowed to talk not allowed to touch not allowed to raise hands that's
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.760]  beyond a super max prison and you pay two hundred thousand dollars to get one
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:02.160]  of these degrees Joe Biggs here with info wars calm RNC Chairman suggests case
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.760]  it could be picked as nominee despite Ohio governor being way behind in the
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.280]  delegate count well that just shows you the dirty trickery they're willing to go
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.720]  to someone that no one really wants to vote for and putting them in after
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.360]  yesterday's Wisconsin primary results came in RNC Chairman rents previous
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.640]  suggested to Sean Hannity that Ohio governor John Casey could still end up
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:26.800]  being the nominee despite the fact that he is far behind both Trump and Cruz in
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.600]  the delegate count Hannity asked previous if he thought Republican voters
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.080]  would feel outright anger frustration and a sense of betrayal if Trump had a
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.600]  400 delegate leave but was not given the nomination previous deflected the
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:44.080]  question referring to previous brokered conventions the establishment both left
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.720]  and right they're willing to go as far as bringing in the guy in last place a
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.960]  little red caboose and allowing him to represent you in the presidential

[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:20.480]  mind
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.960]  ladies and gentlemen we are live now here in the second hour broadcasting
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.880]  worldwide coming up later in the hour I'm gonna play some of these clips last
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:34.920]  week MSNBC and others freaked out media matters run by the White House freaked
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:42.840]  out Buzzfeed alternate all of them read it that oh my gosh the evil Roger Stone a
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:48.360]  former head of Trump's campaign went on the Alex Jones show and said that we
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:53.680]  should be upset if they take the popular vote at the RNC away and give it to
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.840]  somebody else and of course stones been saying for months they may give it to
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.800]  Paul Ryan or to Mitt Romney was zero delegates that even sounded wild to me
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.240]  but I knew everything Stone keeps talking about comes true so I believed it
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.640]  and sure enough the last few weeks Carl Rhodes come out and said oh we need a
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.520]  fresh face we don't even need any delegates we the party can decide and
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.880]  then MSNBC sat there and said can you believe it they want to have millions
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:25.640]  of people there so that when they try to steal it the public can say no yeah we
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.400]  have to go point out that the popular votes always been honored by these
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:34.120]  delegates unless it's very very close you have a public election you have all
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:40.160]  this money spent you have false advertising saying that you go vote one
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:46.520]  man one vote one woman one vote you decide 2016 you decide 2012 you decide
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.360]  2008 you decide you decide you decide and now they're saying oh no we changed
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.560]  the rules way back and we're not gonna let you do that I believe that's in
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.440]  defensible even the parties claim they have all this internal power when you
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.920]  hold yourself out as a public watchdog when you hold yourself out with false
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.720]  advertising we show all the instances where they say your vote counts come
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:15.080]  join our party that this is fraud now Roger Stone was there in 1980 and help
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:20.320]  stop them stealing it from Reagan he was there in 76 as well and his business
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:28.240]  partner Paul Manafort also was there he's been hired by Trump again we didn't
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.440]  want to sit here and you know brag about how how influential stone and his in
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.680]  his cohorts are but you know the point is they know more about what they're
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.720]  doing than some of the other folks and the good news is even Politico came out
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.680]  a few days ago and said look Manafort Stone and others more and more have
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:47.640]  been proven right about how they try to steal the delegates and so they're
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.120]  coming in more and more to try to stop it but stone is still on the outside of
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.840]  the campaign so he can get more done that's why they've announced he's been
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.600]  banned on CNN a month ago now MSNBC through the White House run media
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.760]  matters has announced he's banned and it's because he's so effective and he's
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.720]  telling the truth now he's whether still 44 after or so then we're gonna get into
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.200]  some other news today and I'm gonna try to give him the floor to really walk
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:18.000]  through what happened in Wisconsin where this is going what the next phase is
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.680]  and how we stop him going into Cleveland and beyond but this is a big big deal
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:29.600]  because even if you hate Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders they're robbing both of
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:36.740]  them Trump more spectacularly if they get away with this with party bosses on
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:41.160]  TV like previous and others bragging that your vote doesn't count my god
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.520]  what's next so here to tell us what's happened and what's next is Roger Stone
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:51.400]  of stonezone.com we carry both of his books on the Bush crime family and the
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:56.840]  Clinton sex crimes and in for store.com I should also add so thank you so much
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:01.040]  mr. Stone for joining us right now what you think front and center right now
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.040]  well Alex first of all I want to thank you because nobody has been more
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:10.240]  effective in terms of revealing the secret game plan of the party
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:16.560]  king makers their entire disdain for the democratic process their attempt to
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:23.400]  completely discard the the will of the American people those Republicans in
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.240]  some places Democrats and independents who have voted in overwhelming numbers
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:35.680]  for Donald Trump now this race is changing almost by the hour and I think
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:42.040]  it's important to understand that Trump has fashioned a communications based
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:48.080]  strategy from the beginning and this was all him no one else can take credit
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:54.560]  for this it was his vision to go into the primary states hold these enormous
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:01.400]  rallies and then stand out as the only nationalist in a field of globalists and
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.560]  to tell people the shocking and hard truths about our current fiscal
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:13.960]  situation our current trade policies our current immigration policies which have
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:21.080]  left our country unsafe and then of course the incoherent foreign policy
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:27.000]  that has been pursued by the Bushes and the Clintons and the Bushes and the
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:33.720]  Obamas so I think it is vital to understand that now we're in a phase of
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:42.400]  the campaign where organization matters where knowledge of the arcane rules that
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:49.160]  surround delegate selection matters and but that doesn't mean that the will of
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:54.760]  the people can no longer be manifested we saw this in the Republican National
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:00.840]  Convention in 1940 when thousands of hearings of Wendell Wilkie stormed
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.480]  Philadelphia to make their presence known and there was a popular surge and
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:12.920]  the bosses of the party who were more likely to be for Harold Stassen or Tom
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:22.680]  Dewey or Robert Taft bowed to the will of the people we saw it again in 1952 in
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:30.120]  kind of a reverse where the popular desire for Eisenhower put direct
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.920]  pressure on the party bosses who were lined up for Senator Robert Taft so
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:42.760]  history is repeating itself now what do we need to look for next weekend in
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:49.160]  Colorado look for the big steal Donald Trump will be stolen blind by a
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:56.840]  combination of the Romney Bush Cruz faction of the Colorado establishment
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:03.280]  look to Wyoming where they're going to chisel more delegates away from Donald
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:09.760]  Trump look to Arizona a state that Donald Trump won overwhelmingly in a
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.800]  primary but wait and see they're going to send delegates to the convention who
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.960]  are not loyal to Donald Trump and just in a reputed for new listeners Roger
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:27.040]  Stone stonezone.com you know the top Trump advisors out there confident you
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.120]  predicted I mean I've got to go through all these videos there's so many of them
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.800]  everything that happened unlike and I'm not kissing your butt it's true unlike
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.680]  anyone else out there period in the media I mean you have you have not put
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:42.880]  out bull to just get attention like so many political opponents have done you
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.200]  given everybody the true inside baseball from the smoking rooms but
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:51.080]  predicting what would be in the smoking rooms before it happened you said they'd
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:56.560]  steal Texas the Texas Association the Texas board has come out and said no
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.920]  there was fraud you said that they would do all these things you said they would
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.560]  try to steal Louisiana Arizona Tennessee even though Trump won all those
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:10.560]  they now just give it to Cruz and nakedly admitted it's so crazy so now
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.440]  you're saying they're gonna steal these other states would they dare try to
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.720]  steal California or New York I mean he's gonna win those with huge majorities
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:21.920]  will they just tell us doesn't matter the wooden man the vampire Ted Cruz gets
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:27.320]  them well what we don't know is whether Ted Cruz who some refer to as fat
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:33.520]  Dracula got any palatability in states like New York New Jersey and
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.880]  Pennsylvania remember New York is not taker to winner take all its winner
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:45.440]  take most but Trump has to win 50% in every congressional district in order
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:52.880]  to sweep all three delegates were he to win but do so with less than 50% then
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:59.040]  Ted Cruz or more likely John Kasich could pick up one delegate per
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:05.040]  congressional district now look Alex as I've said many times on your show I do
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:11.520]  not work for Donald Trump I do not work for his campaign I have no formal or
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:19.560]  informal role I am merely a friend of Donald Trump from 40 years standing a
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:25.520]  nationalist and someone who has having been through nine Republican
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:31.560]  presidential campaigns some insights to the process Trump said the other day
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:38.040]  that John Kasich should drop out with all due respect I disagree with that I
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:45.440]  think Trump benefits from split opposition I think Trump benefits from a
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:51.640]  divide in the establishment and I say this for John Kasich at least he has
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:58.280]  had the courage to climb in the arena at least he has had the courage to
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.920]  contend as opposed to Mitt Romney who's wearing pancake makeup right now
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:09.160]  standing in the bullpen waiting desperately for the call to be the
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.680]  compromise candidate of the establishment on a late ballot so I
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:21.040]  actually think it is beneficial for John Kasich to stay in this race sure let me
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:26.160]  bring this point up to you in the states of New York New Jersey Pennsylvania
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:32.880]  believe me Kasich has more going in those places than Ted Cruz and then I
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.720]  think Trump can continue to benefit from split opposition we're going to break
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.880]  them up but I want to ask you specifically about Kasich he seems so
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.440]  confident I understand during this period it's good to have it split up but
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.600]  what about party bosses and others have been going on Fox and others and saying
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.960]  oh we think Kasich's the guy we're gonna give it to you know once they get to
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:56.120]  the convention do you think that they're just patting him on the head or do
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:00.280]  you think that's true because other party bosses like Roeve say they want to
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:05.360]  bring in a Paul Ryan or somebody well I think the boss the part the party bosses
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:11.040]  are not of one mind I've said on this show and elsewhere that I think John
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:17.720]  Kasich has a backup strategy to emerge as a vice presidential candidate who is
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:22.640]  a running dog for the establishment much in the way that George HW Bush was
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:28.120]  forced on Ronald Reagan and who was ultimately able of course to undo much
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:33.240]  of the Reagan Revolution when he sure raised taxes Roger I'm gonna break stay

[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:16.880]  grid has just been written incredibly the author has agreed to give away
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:22.360]  several free copies but only for a limited time to GCN listeners he simply
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:26.800]  asked that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost even
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:31.560]  better if you're one of the first 17 online today he will actually FedEx the
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.840]  book to you why do this why would he spend extra money and all that bother
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.080]  to FedEx his new book the answer is simple America's power grid is in grave
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.320]  danger and most Americans are clueless find out what's going on behind the
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.960]  scenes and why the most common question this author gets is do you fear for your
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.040]  life go to war on the grid dot com that's war on the grid dot com don't
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:58.560]  wait war on the grid dot com
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:12.200]  Roger Stone is our guest and look all I can tell you is this I've been involved
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:16.760]  politically for 25 years on every 21 I've never seen anything like this I
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.600]  can't wait to be in Cleveland everybody has to be there we're gonna have
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:26.000]  websites up soon we're going to be you know pushing everybody to just be there
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.520]  and and and to tell them don't steal it and then when they do steal it have such
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:35.720]  an outcry politically that America knows that a fraud has taken place because
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:40.240]  if we just sit there and don't demonstrate or don't get upset it will
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:46.440]  normalize these fat cats who claim they now appoint who can run for office so
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.320]  basically how would you describe this Roger Stone you call it the big steel I
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:57.880]  call it canceling the election because if you select the candidates isn't that
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:01.400]  then a form of canceling the real election and just having a ceremonial
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.680]  event and then aren't we just communist China where the party appoints its own
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.640]  presidents and then appoints its own successors isn't that a dictatorship of
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:13.760]  oligarchy sir what would you as a political expert call it I think what
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:17.960]  they're trying to do here Alex is rig the election so if we have an election in
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.800]  both which can both candidates are globalists with the exact same agenda
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:28.640]  putting forward different rhetoric to try to sound different then we get a
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:34.160]  replay of the last election Mitt Romney and Barack Obama both believed in
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:39.480]  endless war erosion of our civil liberties massive debt and borrowing
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:45.480]  bailouts for the big banks an interventionist foreign policy that
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:50.040]  costs us blood and treasure but isn't in the best interests of the United States
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:57.480]  immigration policies that very soon will bring hordes of Islamic youths rampaging
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.680]  through our major cities raping pillaging killing defacing public
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:09.240]  property terrorizing honest citizens that is where we're headed if we get a
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:18.200]  two-party duopoly election in which the globalists use legal trickery to choose
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:25.120]  both candidates frankly I feel sorry for Bernie Sanders I think Bernie Sanders is
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:30.880]  a sincere socialist I think he's an honest man I don't agree with him on
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.480]  virtually anything other than trade where we have some substantial agreement
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:41.280]  but they're robbing him too they're cheating against him too because the
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:48.080]  globalist king makers insist on nominating both major candidates and
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:54.720]  they will ensure that no one else isn't let into these debates the libertarian
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.320]  party candidate the green party candidate the constitutional party
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:04.360]  candidate these individuals will never have an opportunity to be in the
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:09.160]  presidential debates and therefore sadly most Americans will never even know
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:15.720]  that those options are legally available to Roger Roger I have the Politico
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:20.440]  article here MSNBC edits out Roger Stone interview so before you learned that
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.400]  you were banned by the White House officially through their organ I mean
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:29.000]  they literally call the shots through media matters showing how controlled our
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.680]  media is in this country you were like in the old Soviet Union to use your words
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:38.040]  edit it out of the photo edit it out of the video this is simply amazing but
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.080]  MSNBC does like to play clips of my show so I'd like you to specifically
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:47.000]  communicate to them they are a dying dinosaur sir but communicating to them
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.240]  they freaked out over your point of saying millions should come to Cleveland
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.480]  so what is your message directly to them and others well Alex gonna be honest
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:02.040]  with you I'm very disappointed this is Soviet style censorship I didn't say
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:07.560]  anything vile or even impolite all I spoke about with two of the most
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:12.640]  respected journalists in American political coverage Mark Halpern and John
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:18.640]  Heilman we did a brief segment on Bloomberg television in which we talked
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.000]  about the fact that you and I and Pat Buchanan and Paul Nagy and other
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.840]  patriots are working together to turn out the people who voted for Trump in
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:36.000]  these primaries and caucuses in Cleveland for a mass-based peaceful
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:43.200]  nonviolent demonstration immediately some in the media tried to say Stone is
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:50.480]  advocating violence I have specifically denounced violence but it is not
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:57.600]  inappropriate for the delegates from a given state to hear directly from their
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:04.040]  constituents from the people they ostensibly represent in Cleveland and
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:07.520]  that's a no-brainer that's a no-brainer when they're openly stealing the popular
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:12.040]  vote they act like we're space aliens from Mars with three heads because we
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:15.760]  say we're gonna go to Cleveland and let the media and the whole nation know
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:19.760]  we're being robbed it's like asking a woman who's being mugged and raped in a
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:23.840]  parking lot not to scream for help I want to come back and talk more about what
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.400]  we do to stop these people how we make sure Trump wins and more with Roger
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:33.080]  Stone we'll be back folks I'm telling you we're talking to the Relief
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.120]  quarterback for the whole Trump operation to win this thing stay with
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.280]  us

[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:10.720]  journalists to bury a cache of hacked documents article up by Wayne Madsen the
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.600]  international consortium of investigative journalists which receives its funding
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:18.560]  from the CIA connected US agency for international development and Ford
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.680]  Foundation as well as George Soros open society foundations has shown its slip
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:27.360]  by declaring that it will not make available the entire cache of hacked
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:33.200]  documents from the Panamanian law firm Mozac Fonseca instead ICIJ maintains
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.400]  that it does not want to expose sensitive information of innocent private
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.200]  individuals along with the public figures we have heard this type of language
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:45.440]  before with massive leaks including the classified national security agency

[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:22.400]  the Alex Jones show Donald Trump is under attack because he's a
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:29.320]  nationalist and he doesn't want to see America fall into globalist control it's
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:34.680]  that simple and that's why the entire establishment is against him the
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:39.960]  American people claim that they want better trade deals lower taxes here's
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:46.440]  someone who will fight to deliver that do they know really will try to get it
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:51.000]  done they know it's not an empty promise and the criminals that have hijacked
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:59.480]  this nation are now so arrogant so evil that they are on national TV both
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:03.080]  Democrat and Republican go and your popular vote doesn't count it never
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:08.480]  did after the billions and billions and billions of false advertising saying
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:15.440]  go out and vote or you get the government you know you ask for it's
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:20.200]  unprecedented and regardless Donald Trump has already won because he forced
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:25.600]  the power structure to cheat openly he came out and talked about the issues
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:30.320]  nobody else would because they were bought and paid for he's a game changer
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:36.120]  Donald Trump is a hero he has amazing courage I disagree with him on some
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:43.840]  issues but that's more of a age gap issue with him being almost 30 years
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:49.600]  older than me Donald Trump's got them scared to death for real this is an
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:55.280]  epic time to be alive and we don't get behind Donald Trump if we don't get
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:35:00.640]  behind Roger Stone at stonezone.com and stopthesteel.org this guy is busting
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:04.640]  his butt people just now realize how important Roger Stone is they just now
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.320]  realize what he's doing behind the scenes and the battles he's fighting that's
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.200]  why they're banning him everywhere because he's exposing what they're doing
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:16.120]  everybody's got to go to stopthesteel.org we're gonna be putting up the
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:20.680]  tales mirrors of what he puts out and he's gonna be our general there on the
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:27.280]  ground all I'm asking our listeners to do is to come in mass to defend the first
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.320]  amendment and the right to vote and to be observers and to be citizen
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:35.920]  journalists everyone should be booking hotels and things in the suburbs the
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:39.160]  republicans have already grabbed all the other hotels people should be staying
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.120]  in nearby cities whatever you have to you need to be there and I want to ask
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:47.000]  roger stone right now to give us marching orders on this particularly the
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.080]  key days when it's most important to be there obviously the aftermath of an
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:55.240]  attempted steal millions of people there who are trumpians that'll send a
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.280]  message don't steal it this could be the moment the establishment blinks but we
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:04.680]  went either way resistances victory they blink we get our candidate we win they
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:09.640]  don't bleak blink they openly steal it they reveal themselves ten times worse I
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:14.720]  mean this is a win-win the only way we lose is not taking action do you agree
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:20.000]  with that what are our directives from your historical understanding of this
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.240]  sir and then other news tidbits of what else we need to know mr. Stone well a
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:29.320]  couple things I want to I want to touch on Alex first of all I have been looking
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:37.640]  at a very interesting quick study comparing the polling results with the
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:43.880]  actual results as reported by the state of Wisconsin on a finite district by
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:49.360]  district basis it is literally scientifically impossible for there to
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:56.960]  be this broad a swing between the polling results and the final results now
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:03.480]  the Walker machine has always been adept at vote stealing Richard Charnan a
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:09.600]  respected mathematician by the way a man of the left but someone I respect for
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:16.240]  candor has done a yeoman work on a monograph showing how the Walker machine
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:23.680]  has stolen votes in past gubernatorial races and in a past recall so I suspect
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:29.600]  funny business in Wisconsin secondarily I would ask the folks who are with us
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:37.160]  here today send an email to msnbc.com and let them know you won't put up with
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:43.320]  Soviet style censorship that you believe in free speech you believe in the first
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:48.960]  amendment and the idea of banning people like Roger Stone because I am
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:53.960]  politically incorrect is an outrage they should be fighting to get you on I
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:57.240]  mean I mean it's crazy they're not looking for ratings but not looking for
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.160]  inside truth of what's going on they know you're a central figure one of the
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:04.880]  top people in the Trump campaign your partner basically runs the Trump campaign
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.520]  now I know you don't want to you know brag about that but it shows they're
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.440]  scared to death of you well Alex and all over I think that's a slight over
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.720]  statement let me be very clear once again I will do anything I possibly can
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:23.120]  to succeed in the nomination and election of Donald Trump what remains to
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:28.160]  be seen though is whether the Trump campaign as it is constituted can
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:36.080]  retool itself for the trench warfare that is ahead my partner Paul Manafort
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:42.520]  a partner of 15 years a friend of mine of almost 50 years someone I've known
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:47.800]  since childhood is without any question the single best convention
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:53.560]  organizer and strategist in the country whether the Trump campaign gives him the
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:39:00.320]  authority and the resources he needs to score a win for Donald Trump remains to
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.400]  be seen I'm disappointed in the Trump campaign in Wisconsin not the efforts of
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.920]  Donald Trump no one worked harder no one was more valiant in the effort he did
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:18.640]  enormous number of of campaign events I also salute the Trump family Ivanka
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.200]  Trump who's just given birth to her third child still doing call-in radio
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.960]  shows in Wisconsin even though she's not ready to get back on the trail Donald
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:34.720]  Jr. Eric I'm incredibly proud of the Trump family they worked very hard how
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:37.920]  hard he'll work for this country I mean the other candidates don't campaign like
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.480]  this Obama didn't campaign like this I mean Trump is absolutely his ass the
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:50.320]  fix was in in Wisconsin so and we cannot tolerate censorship at the MSNBC let's
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.280]  be clear because are you saying that Trump probably really won Wisconsin
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.840]  clearly the whole fix was in with the media both parties money the super PACs
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:04.880]  cruises super PAC that I think legally isn't supposed to be operating there right
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.840]  he massively was outspent there's no question about that I'm not prepared to
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:16.720]  say that it was stolen I'm waiting for the final analysis from Richard Charnin
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:22.320]  who I respect is one of the best election analysts and a specialist in how
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:28.200]  they steal using computerized machines but it is suffice it to say there was
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:34.280]  substantial monkey business as we have seen ironically in every state where
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:42.560]  Ted Cruz has prevailed let's go through them Kansas Texas Oklahoma Utah massive
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:47.640]  voter fraud we're not talking about a few isolated incidents that could be
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:52.440]  explained by by true machine now on record and taking delegates that aren't
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:57.840]  his this is sick yeah it is it is an all-out assault by the establishment
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:03.080]  here's the irony of course if Donald Trump is not the nominee Ted Cruz will
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:07.920]  not be the nominee the globalists don't like him not because of his politics
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:12.120]  they're perfectly comfortable with his politics he's one of them but because of
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:17.040]  his personality so they will push him aside he's not a team player so it's
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:21.120]  true that he's really cold and nasty and like sociopathic well you've seen him on
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:27.240]  television he's shifty literally Alex nothing that comes out of out of Ted Cruz
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.800]  his mouth is the truth he is a congenital liar he was on making Kelly
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:38.600]  the other night accusing me falsely again of planting the National
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:45.640]  Enquirer story Ted show me the proof put up or shut up he's a foreflusher the guy
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:51.640]  is a fraud he is a globalist who's been a low-level family retainer for the
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:55.880]  bushes sure well our liberal investigative journalist Wayne Madsen
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:59.680]  who you know has you know great pedigree he's investigated and he says it does
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:04.320]  point towards Rubio and not Trump yeah I had nothing whatsoever to do with this
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:09.120]  and by the way if I were going to plant a story with the National Enquirer as a
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:14.600]  dirty trick why would I allow myself to be quoted in said story I've been called
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:19.960]  a lot of things Alex but stupid is not one of them no one of them what else is
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.680]  key for us to know sir with your weekly update we really appreciate your time
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:26.800]  and then again what do we do I want our viewers and listeners I know full well
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.560]  we have 15 million viewers and listeners that on YouTube and have them
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:35.840]  stations Facebook everywhere we have algorithms that tell us it's around 14
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:39.640]  to 16 million so I say 15 million it varies every month but growing people in
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:47.040]  the United States who are able to be able to try to get out to Cleveland so
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.760]  there's 15 million people in the United States couple million in Canada to
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:54.560]  everybody should stand up for free and open elections we need everybody to be
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:58.040]  there to monitor this and to let the Republican establishment know they can't
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.880]  do it I mean folks you must be in Cleveland when is the best time for them
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:05.200]  to get there obviously they're going to stay in a city nearby it'll be too
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:08.120]  expensive to stay in the city because they're jacking up prices and
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:11.800]  incredibly don't let the Republicans keep you from being there folks you must
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:15.720]  be there I'm gonna be there what do we do Roger Stone well first of all let's
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:19.840]  give up kind of an overview of what we have planned we will have a mass rally
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:25.640]  a stop the steel rally in which Alex you have graciously agreed to speak I will
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:30.040]  speak there will be other speakers we are going to try to arrange low-cost
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:36.880]  housing through some colleges that are closed in July where their dormitory
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:43.440]  space may be rented so we're working on that we will have demonstrations at
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:49.000]  specific hotels where there are delegates so we can let them visually see
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:55.960]  the will of the people we will have a daily protest we will man the ramparts
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:59.480]  every day and hey it's a free country if we're staying in the hotel we can go
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:03.120]  knock on their hotel room door like you said right well and I have friends in
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:07.120]  every delegation so I will be able to tell you which state delegations are
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:11.480]  involved in the big steel which party leaders are ring leaders in the big
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:17.640]  steel we do not advocate violence we're not talking about roughing anybody up
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:23.240]  we're talking to people is being a presence to let people feel the pressure
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:28.480]  of the American people and those who have bothered to vote in these primaries
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.400]  and caucus yeah we're the victims that they're openly robbing as we speak in
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:37.440]  the state where I live in Louisiana Tennessee Arizona where he's winning
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.360]  they're just stealing it openly admitting it and then they turn it around
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:46.480]  on MSNBC like it's bad that meet that we might want to go demonstrate I mean I
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.600]  don't normally stutter that's so outrageous I have trouble getting those
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.960]  words out of my mouth Roger well it's typical of the liberal double standard so
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:45:00.440]  the international criminal George Soros and his henchman David Brock advocate
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:06.560]  violence send people to the Trump rallies to try to inspire violence yet
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:13.040]  they turn around and they they accuse us falsely of promoting violence I am
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:19.080]  promoting nonviolent protest in Cleveland well here's the good news for folks
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.520]  there's a lot of libertarians conservatives only to demonstrate this
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.520]  associated with the socialists in the commies this is a battle against them
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:28.040]  and Soros that financed the violent overthrow of Middle Eastern countries and
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:34.080]  Ukraine and bragged about it on CNN to Fareed Zakaria so folks the police
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:40.120]  they're in that city our patriots on average they understand this is a war
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:44.040]  against local government police they understand that Donald Trump is a
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.960]  populist that wants to make America great again and I can tell you right now
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:51.680]  we are going to have not the support but the defense of the police knowing
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:55.920]  we're in the right protecting our first amendment against the Soros trash and
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.440]  we're gonna outnumber them 50 to 1 if you take action this will be a day long
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:06.360]  remembered okay it's time to stand for the roaches that are the trash and the
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:12.680]  Nazi collaborators like George Soros Roger so watch the website stop the
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:18.360]  steal or very shortly we will be posting details we're in negotiations with the
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:22.320]  convention bureau in the city of Cleveland for an outdoor permit for a
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:28.800]  massive rally we're gonna do this by the book but in numbers there is strength
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:35.320]  we need a massive turnout so if you don't have a summer vacation planned this
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:40.200]  will be your big cancel it this is the battle for the Republic in my 20 plus
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:43.480]  years of activism I've never been involved in something this important
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:49.960]  Cleveland I'm told is beautiful in July so come on out stand up for your country
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:54.720]  stand up for the right to vote stand up to George Soros and Obama and the
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:47:00.440]  Muslim Brotherhood and all this scum indeed all right Roger Stone stone
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:05.040]  zone.com I will have more details you're working hard what else can people do to
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:09.720]  support you let me just say this final point I know for an absolute fact I'm
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:15.560]  going to disclose here that the formal account for the Republican convention the
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:20.560]  one that Reince Priebus is carrying around in his breast pocket has Donald
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:28.760]  Trump at 1205 votes right now the the king makers the bosses the insiders are
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:35.920]  getting growingly confident they can stop the Trump revolution and I say don't
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:40.800]  bet the ranch. That's gonna be news making what you just said flesh that out
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:45.000]  for folks that aren't you know experts on the Arcania as you call it on the
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.040]  Byzantine system of the delegates explain what he's got in his pocket. Well
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:52.840]  what it means of course is that the party bosses know the plan they know how
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:48:00.720]  many votes they intend to steal in Wyoming they know how many votes they
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.960]  intend to steal in Arizona they know how many votes they intend to steal next
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:09.320]  weekend in Colorado they know where they're going to try to chisel votes
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:14.640]  from states that Trump has already won overwhelmingly so their private secret
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:21.920]  vote count shows them stalling Donald Trump but it's not over till it's over
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:27.280]  and Donald Trump and the Trump campaign have many strategic options left open to
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:32.600]  them it remains to be seen whether the campaign can be retooled and whether
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:38.440]  politically experienced people can be put in key places to replace those
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:43.840]  incredibly enthusiastic but less experienced people who I salute for
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.880]  being for Donald Trump but I was distressed to learn Alex that the woman
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:54.280]  who ran the Trump campaign in Wisconsin was the same woman who ran the losing
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:49:00.360]  Trump campaign in Oklahoma and prior to that this nice woman had no political
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:07.600]  experience whatsoever this is a time for experience this is a time to get some
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.040]  of the grizzled veterans who were for Ron Paul many Ron Paul supporters working
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:17.680]  with us in these conventions and time for the people that are supporting
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.960]  Sanders to realize Hillary's gonna steal it you should stand with Trump for
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.080]  populism and get past the political correct brainwashing you know it's a
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:30.800]  bunch of political warfare garbage the the the whole elite you claim you hate
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:35.240]  are against Trump don't be morons in fact a lot of them are saying they're
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:40.080]  gonna vote for Trump that's a beautiful thing simply amazing well Roger Stone
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:44.000]  we'll get another update from you soon anytime you want to pop in and break news

[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:02.880]  heart is pitter-pattering right now because we're just being robbed nakedly
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:05.400]  by the globalists in front of everybody right now I mean this is just too
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:10.400]  insane now we've had our reporters on the ground all over the east coast all
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.560]  over Wisconsin in the Midwest Joe Biggs followed these groups so they were
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:20.000]  gonna have the biggest protest ever marching from one state to another he
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.360]  was there shot a lot of viral videos was in the midst of these people those
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:29.520]  videos are up obviously on info wars calm and prison planet calm there is so
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:34.480]  much going on so much happening so I want to have Joe Biggs here with us for
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:37.680]  the balance of this segment till we go to break at the end of the hour and for
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.120]  five more minutes after that and then we're gonna just cover so much of the
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:46.800]  other news we haven't gotten to yet in the third hour today but first off we're
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:52.640]  also gonna be discussing the coming default wave is shaping up to be among
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:57.560]  the most painful in history that's Bloomberg politics there's so many
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:00.720]  triggers so many things financially happening right now that are kicking off
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:07.740]  and militarily that's why I say my gut is just not in a night you know my gut
[01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:10.800]  was in a knot before we went over the cliff now I feel like we're in the
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:17.680]  the battle I mean I feel so alive it is ridiculous and I just can't wait to go
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:22.400]  to Cleveland I cannot wait to see the Soros trash the Republican bots trash
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:28.360]  for myself I cannot wait wild horses could not drag me away this is so
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:31.880]  historical it's so much bigger than Trump and I keep saying that but listen to
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:35.720]  me please please if you don't like Trump fine or stuff about him I don't like
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:41.840]  either but here's the deal he's got him scared to death because he's a
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:45.760]  nationalist he doesn't want to have one-sided deals and screw us over he is
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:50.840]  into prosperity and he doesn't like the New World Order and they know it they
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:55.000]  know it and the signals he sent and the things he's been doing and the way he's
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.120]  been playing the system they are scared of him he thinks he's smarter than them
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:04.800]  and you know what he is now the question is are we smarter than the
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:09.280]  globalist we're going to Joe Biggs here in just a moment also don't forget I'm
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:13.240]  gonna send six or seven people including myself to Cleveland for a week that is
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:18.040]  gonna be I'm not complaining it's just to get on that field we're talking you
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:25.920]  can't even get any type of lodging there because the Republicans a year out
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:29.040]  bought everything in the city you've got to go get houses condos things like
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:32.240]  that that's what we're doing and we're talking stuff 10 miles away that takes
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:35.600]  30 minutes to get there is a thousand dollars a night okay and I'm talking to

[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:46.600]  went you know buy your lonesome out there the lone wolf in the media covering
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:51.960]  this and what your experiences told you and what this foreshadows going into
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:58.160]  this summer of rage so I was in Pennsylvania I was at Philadelphia and
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:02.520]  that was the start at Independence Hall for democracy spring now this was
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:07.120]  supposed to be one of the largest civil uprisings in America and that just
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:13.800]  quite frankly was not the fact maybe 300 people showed up to the event 3424
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:17.760]  people I believe it was actually signed up and pledged to go out there and said
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:21.960]  that they would even be willing you had to check a box to be arrested if it came
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:26.520]  to that point you know so they had a couple speakers I had this lady Gabby
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:30.240]  Hoffman she's an actor come out and talk about democracy spring and how much
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.120]  they love Bernie Sanders and how they want to take money out of politics and
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.960]  they don't want people to feel like they're being forced with money to vote
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:41.600]  for certain people like Hillary Clinton and some of them even said Donald Trump
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:44.520]  and I said well he's not really taking money from anybody so you can't use that
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.640]  argument but there's one thing I can tell you about Philadelphia at
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.840]  Pennsylvania as a whole there's a lot of Trump supporters you have to remember
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:59.200]  about a month ago 46,000 Democrats switched over to Republican for this
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:03.920]  year to vote for Donald Trump and in Massachusetts 20,000 people as well did
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.040]  that and that's why there's panicking and having to steal the delegates at the
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:10.640]  state level and that's key though it seems like the George Soros funding and
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.600]  the Black Lives Matter whole crew is kind of sputtering we saw that in
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:18.560]  Wisconsin there'd be like 20 people against Trump and 5,000 there to see
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:22.960]  Trump but still he lost the evidence is overwhelming they stole Wisconsin as well
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:27.840]  Wisconsin think about this this is up to Annie you know when I was out there in
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:31.920]  Philly there's so many people who were for Trump everywhere when people were
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:34.880]  talking about I had a little Trump thing on my phone people were like oh yeah
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:38.920]  Donald Trump yeah and they would just want to you know talk about it but one
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.960]  of the interesting things is they have unions in Pennsylvania you've got unions
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:46.120]  over there in Jersey you've got the unions up in New York and I talked to a
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:49.080]  lot of union guys they don't want to be on camera right now because based on the
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:53.280]  fact that these are Democrat states they're all primarily Democrat so but
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.800]  what they said is if Donald Trump would be willing to come out on TV in support
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:02.040]  of the union the teamsters they're gonna get their votes those family members
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:05.720]  are gonna get theirs so forth and so sure but the unions are obviously gonna go
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.800]  for him because it's the blue-collar Americana appeal the rest of it no no
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:11.920]  they're most of them will only tell people this was a guy was telling me
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:15.640]  said his bosses will tell his guys to go for Hillary Clinton because that's what
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:18.760]  they do sure sure but but I think they're not gonna follow those orders at
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:22.680]  this point plus they should be thanking him for being it's NAFTA and GATT and
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:27.400]  all the things the big unions sold out to yeah I mean the unions are a joke they
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:31.840]  become a lobbying organization for open borders so the unions need to stop being
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:35.200]  on power trips and I'm telling you they don't get behind Trump they're idiots

[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:36.520]  the establishment thinking because I've never seen such a wake-up call Joe and
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:40.240]  he was saying you know most people you ran to on the east coast or Trump
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:44.760]  supporters yeah the South loves him the California is gonna go for him the
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:49.640]  conservatives there man I just what are they thinking and what other tidbits did
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:52.960]  you notice while you're on the east coast I know you caught this sports riot
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:56.200]  on tape I mean yeah I was in Philadelphia I was there covering
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:01.520]  democracy spring there was a train crash that happened some guys were on a live
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:06.320]  track they know there's a train coming it's 20 is 2016 how do people get hit
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:10.120]  by trains how do you leave something on a train when you on a train track when
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:14.240]  you know that that's being it's being used like I don't understand how a lot
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:16.800]  of the trendies think that the train's gonna stop for them they don't know it
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:20.120]  can't stop I mean one of the guys that died been working for Amtrak for 40
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:24.040]  years the other guy 20 years you know they're you know been doing this their
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:28.560]  entire life maybe it was complacency I don't know but they'd left this backhoe
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:32.080]  right there on the side of the track they clip the train ball of fire a lot
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:36.760]  people got hurt two people died I mean let me tell you America has some of the
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:40.400]  worst trains in the world I think only North Korea's are worse I mean our
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.360]  country is falling apart when they had a they had that extremely deadly when it
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:47.440]  was 30 miles north just last year and up in Philly there was another train wreck
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:51.040]  a few weeks ago not just from the backhoe look our trains can't go over 50
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:55.440]  miles an hour the beds are so bad my grandmother used to go take college
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:00.000]  courses got her master's degree or whatever shooting from Teague Texas down
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.440]  on a bullet train to Houston that went over 110 miles an hour and back now
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:08.760]  those same trains won't go 45 miles an hour I just don't know how this kind of
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:13.120]  stuff happens you know how do the trains go 110 miles an hour when my grandma was
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:17.720]  20 and now they don't well they're claiming these things go like 150 miles
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:20.000]  an hour through this rural neighborhood but I just don't see it because I've
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.080]  seen them zipping by and they didn't look they're going too fast where I was at
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:27.000]  they can't they fly off the rails they haven't updated the rails yeah what
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.800]  else did you mean so many videos Joe what else did you pick up so when I was
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:34.280]  out there I heard about the NCAA basketball championship and I found
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.480]  out that Villanova is a school that's actually just right outside of
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:40.320]  Philadelphia and I saw reading some articles and a lot of the police were
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.560]  already gearing up they got riot gear there was helicopters being on standby
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:47.840]  they said they had people from different counties showing up so I thought this
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.040]  would be something interesting to cover so I actually drove up to the Villanova
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:56.200]  campus and got out there about an hour early before the basketball game started
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.240]  and found out that they were actually having a live watch party at the
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:02.440]  Villanova basketball stadium the championship was being held down here
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:07.400]  in Houston Texas and we sat inside and I let the cameras roll and you know the
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:11.440]  guys Villanova won all the students thousands of kids come running out into
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:17.400]  the streets screaming jumping up on poles lighting a cardboard cutouts of what
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.360]  looked like the UNC basketball coach the rival team that they played screaming
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:25.280]  you know that they hated Temple another university that's close by and this is
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:29.440]  mindless tribalism notice these are mainly white kids yeah and this is it
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:34.040]  doesn't matter black white people act like this tribal idiocy they won't stand
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:37.840]  up for their freedoms they'll just run around and act like morons and burn and
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.840]  break things because a stupid team won a game yeah it's pretty ridiculous I mean
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:44.600]  this school it's a rich it's a very rich campus I mean there's a Ferrari
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.920]  dealership on campus I mean that shows you what's going on but I mean as this
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:53.800]  was going on there were riot police everywhere cops on horses cops on
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:57.120]  motorcycles there was like four helicopters flying overhead bottles
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:00.320]  flying but they won't ride at the TPP takes their rights away or they won't
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:06.040]  ride they stole the delegates exactly I'm sorry look at how pale and dumb and
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:11.920]  soft they look look in their eyes I mean this is our future look at these goons
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:15.800]  oh my gosh I mean I got one guy he was sitting there he saw my phone I had a
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:20.440]  Donald Trump thing on it and the guy goes Donald Trump yeah and then he threw
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.160]  a bottle through the air I mean these kids have no idea what they're doing
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:28.480]  they're just out running around but I mean why can't we have our youth to get
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:32.760]  this excited about politics why can't I don't mind the redhead hopper on
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:35.800]  excited like see the woman excited that's good stuff no but I mean you think
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:39.160]  I'm not trying to be mean but they just they look like they're 14 yeah this
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:43.600]  arrested development I mean I wasn't acting like that at 20 I just don't get

[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:04.800]  chairman suggests case it could be picked as nominee despite Ohio Governor
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:08.600]  being way behind in the delegate count well that just shows you the dirty
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:12.240]  trickery they're willing to go to someone that no one really wants to vote
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:16.280]  for and put them in after yesterday's Wisconsin primary results came in RNC
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:20.480]  chairman rents previous suggested to Sean Hannity that Ohio Governor John case
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:24.800]  it could still end up being the nominee despite the fact that he is far
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:28.960]  behind both Trump and Cruz in the delegate count Hannity asked previous
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:33.360]  if he thought Republican voters would feel outright anger frustration and a
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:37.800]  sense of betrayal if Trump had a 400 delegate leave but was not given the
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:41.400]  nomination previous deflected the question referring to previous brokered
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:46.280]  conventions the establishment both left and right they're willing to go as far

[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:50.800]  now he's grown old Merrill Haggard 79 died of pneumonia I guess this mystery
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:58.400]  flew it's going around and guess why Dr. Group was set up for this show two
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:03.960]  weeks ago and came here from Houston to be in studio with us today the mystery
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:08.960]  flew the mystery pneumonia killing massive numbers of people it was around
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:16.960]  two years ago and killed my uncle my cousin two of my cousins and now it's
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:23.360]  back in the hospitals won't say what it is so we were already gonna be covering
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:29.000]  this and boom it's taken Merrill Haggard the hag if Weldon wants to get his
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.400]  acoustic guitar ready and come in here and do poncho and left you maybe in the
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:39.560]  no man's land between the third and fourth hour he could do it or he can
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:43.880]  come in here and set up with his electric guitar if he wants to but he did
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:49.200]  an amazing job yesterday with that town's van zant song that you just heard
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:53.560]  Merrill Haggard Willie Nelson singing country music legend Merrill Haggard dies
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:58.840]  at 79 Bakersfield California he was an oaky but part of that big flood out
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:04.240]  there in the Dust Bowl country music legend and native Oklahoma Merrill
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:08.880]  Haggard has passed away on his birthday he was 79 years old the singer song
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:13.560]  runner was one of the pioneers of the Bakersfield sound Haggard was also
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:17.160]  involved in the outlaw country movement yeah he got into country music when he
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:21.000]  heard Johnny Cash come sing at San Quentin I mean truth is stranger than
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.160]  fiction in addition to his 40 number one hits Haggard has won just about every
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:31.920]  music award last month Haggard hit mama tried was selected for presentation in
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:36.160]  the national recording registry Haggard was inducted into the country music
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:42.600]  hall of fame in 94 he is the Oklahoma music hall of fame so Merrill Haggard
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.880]  dead at 79 and this just broke five minutes ago literally great job the
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:53.080]  crew grabbing that song so quickly that's why Dr. Group is here with us
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:59.720]  Dr. Group for me former army operative in his own right and of course holds a
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:04.160]  many different medical degrees you can find out more at info wars.com in the
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:08.840]  bio section of our guest or at global healing center.com Dr. Group will be
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:12.480]  with us for the balance of the hour than David Knight takes over in the fourth
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:19.000]  hour and I had a whole stack of news for why he was coming on the show today and
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.320]  what he was going to be discussing flu season peaking later than usual that's
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:29.560]  the Idaho State Journal stand to the community grieves after educator dies
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:33.720]  from complications from the flu and it's killing people in the lungs flu season
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:38.440]  hits new highs but massive vaccinations happening people say you need to take the
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:41.720]  shot so I don't get sick but they're the people that have taken it that are
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:45.680]  dying so many times I mean if you're protected then you're protected I thought
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:51.320]  flu season hits new highs and it's going so late we have another article others
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:57.240]  dying that are prominent so it just expands North Carolina reports eight
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:02.080]  more deaths from influenza we're gonna be breaking this down but Merrill Haggard
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:08.400]  dead at 79 certainly some sad news but his great music will live on forever the
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:11.840]  hag is dead I guess I could try to call up Willie Nelson I've hung out with him
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:15.520]  in a while but he's friends and maybe get his take on this but what we really
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:20.000]  want to do is take this sad death and draw attention to more and more of these
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.120]  mystery illnesses that are out there and the studies that admit when you take the
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:28.040]  regular flu shot it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next year and
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.480]  lowers your immunity but that's not something they tell people they tell
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:35.240]  them just get the flu shot every year even though they've had studies out for
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:40.320]  20 years that three consecutive flu shots in a three-year period doubles your
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:45.320]  chances of early onset of Alzheimer's so we're gonna discuss all of this with
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:49.720]  Dr. Edward group also one of the top formulators of products at info wars
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:53.520]  life comm doc thanks for coming in today thanks for having me on appreciate it
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:57.560]  this really underlines or highlights what you were already coming in to talk
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:03.160]  about one minute two minutes before you're going on the hag is dead well
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:07.480]  who comes running in here touch your music share in his own right pretty darn
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:12.240]  successful and then it's on the same subject you're about to cover that is
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:16.920]  weird it is weird it what's weird is what happened to me about three weeks ago
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:21.080]  I was with my family on spring break in Utah Park City near Valley where we go
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:25.920]  every year and when I got there I looked in the sky and I saw chem trails
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.080]  everywhere and my wife said to me oh my gosh look at all these chem trails
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:33.680]  everywhere and so we started walking around the town and everybody was
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:38.040]  coughing and hacking and has respiratory illnesses and people were
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:41.440]  actually saying I was asking a couple people said what's going on around here
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:45.400]  and they said well they're calling it the Park City flu and so I didn't think
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:50.200]  anything of it and I ski for a couple days and on day three I start feeling
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:53.960]  really bad I'm looking up I'm like great now my whole vacation is going to be
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:58.600]  ruined I don't even get sick I know that if I get sick there's something
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:04.760]  seriously going on and I can literally feel it in my body and I know that when
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:07.720]  there's something man-made or there's something strange or some sort of
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:15.080]  biological weapon that there's something else going on so I'm knocked out in the
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:19.040]  bed can't even move I'm drinking three bottles of silver a day I'm taking a
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:23.680]  hundred drops of oregano I'm taking a bunch of iodine and I'm barely getting
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:28.040]  by my throat my respiratory everything is going on so like on day three I can
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:32.120]  finally start getting to the computer so I start looking and saying there's
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:35.800]  something weird going on I need to find out what it is so I'm thinking it's
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:38.840]  spring break all over the country is going to be spring break for the next
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:44.160]  three weeks that's the perfect time for them to spray and you know everybody
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:48.320]  leaves their hometown for spring break right so they're all going to the East
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:51.280]  Coast they're all going to the West Coast they're going to Arizona they're
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:55.360]  going skiing in Colorado in Utah so I start looking at the different
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:58.760]  chemtrail websites and trying to figure out what's going on sure enough I came
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:03.360]  up with you know digging deep enough with chemtrail flu and realize that they
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:08.600]  heavily sprayed the East Coast the right along the border of Canada and the
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:12.000]  United States so the whole North they squared in the United States and by the
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.960]  way they cover a lot of this with geoengineering it's admitted they're
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:20.560]  doing it there are UN treaties on it they have proven they are retrofitting
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:25.320]  planes they also add key compounds to jet fuel so it's compartmentalized we
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:30.520]  have the patents so even the companies don't know they're directed by homeland
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:35.120]  security just to do it that's why even NASA admits the earth is now 30% darker
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:41.520]  you can type in satellite images of chemtrails from space that's the layman's
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:46.240]  term but this is going on there's also low altitude spring going on they admit
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:51.640]  CIA testing in almost every city of the US in some cases spring chemicals
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:56.000]  biologicals radiologicals on towns then having the military doctors in the
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:03.440]  hospitals to quote test the response so secret human testing is massive most the
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:07.520]  public only knows about black people and Tuskegee because they wanted the public
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:12.520]  to know and think oh it's just the black people no folks no they've been
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:17.840]  injecting large parts of the population with syphilis in the vaccines you think
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:21.240]  it's a vaccine is really syphilis my grandmother got polio from the polio
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:26.680]  vaccine one week later this is a massive eugenics operation as Prince Philip
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:31.560]  talked about please continue so of course me being a researcher I wanted to
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:36.640]  dive into this even more and at the same time by the way we're getting emails
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:39.720]  from people that are sick all over the nation this has been going on like I
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:44.000]  said about three weeks ago it started and I don't even think we're in the real
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:50.360]  big you know pandemic part of it yet people get tested and don't even have
[02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:53.800]  the flu virus they just say people I know an awesome is I'm taking people to
[02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:56.720]  the doctor and they said this well we just caught the flu we don't know what
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:00.640]  it is this is definitely not the flu I mean they're going in and they're
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:04.280]  getting flu shots obviously they're getting they're being told it's influenza
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:09.440]  but the research that I pulled up it's not any we can link all these things with
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:12.880]  the pneumonia and the respiratory and the heart conditions that are going on
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:17.440]  over the all across the US like I said they sprayed not only and they not
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:20.840]  only did they square in the US but they also sprayed right across the middle of
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:24.480]  the US that's why you're seeing all these deaths and everything happened along
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:27.880]  the East Coast the West Coast along the South and everything else and Merrill
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:32.600]  Haggard just died and Merrill Haggard just died so I pulled up some sample
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:36.080]  there's a there's the an agency in Victoria British Columbia because
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:41.360]  whatever they're doing up there is really taking a bad people are having
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:46.680]  really bad reactions and this this life this samples were given to this lab
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:49.960]  that are licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency and they found
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:55.560]  ethylene dibromide which is a pesticide a banned pesticide which causes severe
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:18:01.440]  respiratory reactions at low levels they found Pseudomonas originosa which not
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:06.000]  only causes respiratory infection but also attacks the immune system I told
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.880]  my wife I said it I feels like there's three organisms that are attacking me at
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:15.800]  once that was before I knew this and sure enough they identified three
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:20.480]  organisms the second one is seracea marcessans which is an antibiotic
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:27.560]  resistant bacteria which causes pneumonia endocarditis and meningitis and the
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:32.240]  last one was streptomyces and molds capable of inducing heart disease upper
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:35.160]  respiratory they now admit there's all these weird mutated moles that are
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:38.800]  killing the bats killing the turtles cause people have heart attacks brain
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:44.080]  tumors are growing and young people suddenly from mold molds getting through
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:47.360]  the blood brain barrier and then molds growing in the brain I mean what have

[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:56.920]  stream dumps in all over the United States so it was this is insane top it
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:00.040]  off with the aluminum nanoparticles that they're spraying down on us and
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:03.000]  everything else which is an admitted giant secret program they admit they're
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:07.320]  doing it billions being spent spraying us with aluminum and Monsanto's coming
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:12.360]  out with seeds that can grow in aluminum soil and then you got the Zika virus
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:17.080]  which they admit is linked to mutations and engineered with the Rockefeller
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:21.720]  Foundation creating it a souped-up version right I mean you cannot make this
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:25.960]  up you cannot make it up it's happening if you talk to farmers all over the
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:31.640]  world the aluminum nanoparticles are causing a very acidic soil messing up
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:35.640]  all the plants including organic foods and beverages and it's something that
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:39.560]  needs to be stopped obviously what most of us being raised down a greenhouse to
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:42.920]  be organic because you test it and it's got aluminum and it's just raining out
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:45.840]  of the sky that's what we're doing we're setting up greenhouses at our farm to
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:50.080]  grow all the urge just so we can protect them from the air stay there I want to

[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:20.320]  Haggart died when the country was from the mystery pneumonia slash flu that put
[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:26.320]  Joe Beggs in the hospital clack before else and Weldon Henson who's super
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:30.040]  healthy he was in the hospital and almost me I thought I literally thought I was
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:34.760]  gonna die there for a minute let's hear a little bit more from the hag before the
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:45.680]  Beatles and yesterday when a man could still work still would
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:25:10.680]  we'll play this part then we'll get back to the broadcast we are until we
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:13.760]  admitted to ourselves by the end of the song though he says stop rolling down
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:23.600]  Hill going to Joe Beggs briefly because I've forgotten seeing him walk around
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:26.800]  the office that he was in the hospital sick as he been in his life he always
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:30.640]  brags he doesn't get sick they couldn't say it was flu couldn't say it was
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:34.480]  pneumonia had pneumonia and this is just all over the country and the media is
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:39.720]  not really reporting on it I mean it's here or there but this is scary and then
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:44.160]  you have congressional hearing reports where they call Kim trails an exotic
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:50.040]  weapon system it's going on all sorts of different cocktails are being sprayed on
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:54.240]  us and they tell us it's ice crystals until the early 90s when the Nobel
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:58.720]  Prize was when we're coming up with this and Nobel Prize was one for it there
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:04.840]  were no Kim trails condensation trails ice crystals formed above 20,000 feet in
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:08.040]  the summer a little bit lower in the winter it was ice crystals and they
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:12.640]  faded away within a minute I sit there and watch these working in the garden
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:17.240]  whatever spray they're there three hours later expanding and drifting down
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:23.640]  forming cloud banks they teach kids in university textbooks but also an
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:27.120]  elementary textbooks the entire gamut that there's a program to save the earth
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:32.200]  from solar radiation it's a government program and it is anti-human and
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:35.280]  poisoning the earth Joe Biggs tell folks what happened to you it was
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:38.120]  interesting I was just sitting in my desk and I was listening to a doctor group
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:41.480]  speak about the matter and how they were there's huge Kim trail dump up north
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:45.360]  so I was just recently in Philly you know two weeks prior to that I was
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:50.000]  deathly ill I was in a hospital on and off I lost about 10 pounds like all I
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.400]  could do was sleep I had no energy I felt like I was on my deathbed I woke up
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:57.600]  in cold sweats and it reminded me because when I was in Philly I had a
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:01.960]  conversation at the democracy spring protests I was actually speaking to one
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:05.440]  of the older gentlemen that lived out there's whole life and he says hey man
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:07.880]  make sure you stay warm he's like you don't want to catch the pneumonia that's
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:12.040]  going around and I said that's funny you say that I just had the flu and pneumonia
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:15.160]  and he goes man he's like you probably got the chemtrail flu and that's what
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:18.160]  they're calling it right now in Philly this is coming from a bunch of Bernie
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:21.400]  supporters from Trump guys that are out there I spoke to a lot of people are
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:24.400]  getting a lot of people are dying from pneumonia notice how the public knows
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.920]  even people that aren't listeners know about the chemtrail flu people know
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:33.760]  that we've got an evil multinational global force against us it's not aliens
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:38.520]  but it might as well be it's a global secret technology that uses all of our
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:42.920]  tax money to build these huge Manhattan project programs and then you use them
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:47.040]  against us yeah the last time I had the flu I was like 12 years old you know I
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:51.080]  got when I joined the military when they started forcing us to take those flu
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:56.000]  shots I would get sick from time to time but I mean this was the full-on flu I'm
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:59.520]  in the bed then I was able to get pneumonia I mean I literally thought I
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:03.520]  was gonna die a couple days there was so bad that I didn't even know who I was
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:07.720]  speaking to I couldn't walk I fell over and that's when I had to get someone to
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:11.120]  help me drag me pick me up and take me to the hospital they took all these tests
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:14.520]  they found out that I had flu a and then they did chest x-rays and I'm finding
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:18.000]  out that I had pneumonia as well on top of that I thought I was gonna die so
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.920]  this is something that people really need to look into you know the fact that
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:24.440]  I know the more vaccines we get the worse it gets Joe thank you we're glad you
[02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:28.360]  didn't go the way I'm Earl Haggard amazing tell folks what's coming up we're
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:32.320]  going to break this but some of the US code okay so as I was looking into it
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:38.840]  even more HR 2977 is a bill that was introduced into the 107th US Congress in
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:45.560]  2001 and chemtrails were referred to as an exotic weapons system and
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:50.600]  supposedly chemtrails spraying over humans in the US gained its legality
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:57.440]  from US code title 50 section 1520 which gives the Secretary of Defense
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:04.400]  authority to order testing involving the use of a chemical agent or biological
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:09.920]  agent on civilian population for research purposes that's right well US
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:15.360]  code title 50 shepherd US code title 50 shepherd 32 so section 1520 a paragraph
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:21.200]  B quote prohibits secret testing including lethal unless it's for research
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:27.040]  or law enforcement purposes yeah so it's okay to kill us or test on us it was for
[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:31.360]  research or law enforcement purposes yeah that's right and in what you what
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:35.600]  people don't realize is when they block the UVB rays is a whole nother eugenics
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:39.960]  program you block the body and the plants ability to grow properly and you
[02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:44.880]  block vital and that's why Cass Sunstein at the White House wants a law banning
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:48.840]  saying sunlight is good he wants a law where your kids aren't allowed to have
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:53.640]  it it's child abuse run they might as well be aliens and the GCN radio
[02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:56.320]  network
[02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:04.120]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com no no no CNN host cut off interview after guests
[02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:07.840]  mentions Hillary's defense of child rapists CNN host Carol Costello
[02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:12.160]  abruptly ended a segment Tuesday after a guest brought up Hillary Clinton's
[02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:18.240]  1975 legal defense of an accused child rapist appearing on CNN newsroom with
[02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:22.520]  Carol Costello on Tuesday Newsmax Steve Malzberg who supports Donald Trump said
[02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:26.320]  when you get one-on-one especially if it's Hillary Donald Trump will go places
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:29.920]  nobody is willing to go bringing up Clinton's women who say they were
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:34.040]  intimidated by Hillary having them come forward and speak that's one of the
[02:30:34.040 --> 02:30:38.920]  issues but you also have to remember the botcha boys in Afghanistan when I was in
[02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:43.720]  Afghanistan she sanctioned child rape and let it happen she didn't care
[02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:47.960]  Hillary Clinton is pure or evil and Hillary Clinton's crying and whining
[02:30:47.960 --> 02:30:51.960]  since she's had enough of Bernie Sanders guess what Hillary America has had

[02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:10.000]  known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:13.960]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding
[02:32:13.960 --> 02:32:18.200]  fluoride the bad member of the halogen family in the water they took the good
[02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:23.160]  halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:27.240]  it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and
[02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:32.760]  family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the
[02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:37.520]  connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:41.520]  be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these
[02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:45.480]  studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine
[02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:50.440]  is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival
[02:32:50.440 --> 02:33:15.440]  shield x2 today at info wars life calm or by calling 888-253-3139

[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:04.400]  back a surplus now they tell me to be careful because it might get to the point
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:08.080]  where you know we get too many orders and then we don't have it held back but
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:12.680]  for now we've been able to do that 10% off when you sign up for auto ship you

[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:23.440]  for prison classic shirt but it is a new design from the original but it looks
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:28.040]  almost the same legalized freedom info wars comm is in red not white on the
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:32.720]  back and where it says hillary for prison 2016 it says under it till the end of
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:37.400]  time that was a very very popular shirt our second most popular shirt ever I
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:40.720]  said it was limited edition it was gone for three months people got really mad
[02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:44.760]  and so okay I brought it back but technically I always got to keep my
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:47.960]  word here it is a different shirt but it's pretty much the same and those are
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:53.080]  available at infowarstore.com that helps from the operation now I personally
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:56.440]  need to drink this three times a day this tastes way better than any fruit
[02:34:56.440 --> 02:35:00.960]  punch I've ever had it's flavored by the vitamin C and things that are in there
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:07.240]  it really is amazing and I hope that people will try it out it'll be a month
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:11.360]  until we get more of it in and that's the issue Dr. Group probably produces
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:15.920]  60% of our products we have two other big well-known established you know top
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:20.440]  labs that are the highest quality in the country and it took us two years there
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:25.000]  are hundreds of other vitamin mineral you know type fusions out there that are
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.720]  you know pretty good in many cases but the point is we wanted to make the very
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:32.600]  best with the highest quality at the lowest price with the best taste and
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:36.840]  that's what we have developed here we're very very proud of it this is really the
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:41.160]  best multivitamin to make sure your kids have their multivitamins that you have
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:43.800]  it you don't forget to take it to make sure you're getting that better
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:49.960]  absorption infowarstore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 now Dr. Group I
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:54.640]  want you to get deep into the aerosol manipulation of our weather what's
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:57.920]  being piggybacked on this because most of the government officials are told this
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:01.960]  is weather modification well just like they piggyback and other operations are
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:05.840]  piggybacking here there's always a cover reason that's dangerous and
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:11.280]  necronian but many other sub levels and Trojan horses that is the modus operandi
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:16.440]  of the globalist that were up against but separately DNA force that you
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:21.560]  developed with my father who's a chemist not just a retired oral surgeon and
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:25.840]  dentist and he's actually worked on drugs that have been approved by the FDA
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:32.000]  with the military wound wound you know systems to stop you know wounds being
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:35.240]  infected dry socket things like that he had always wanted to produce a
[02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:39.080]  nutraceutical level system that was a lot less than we have to get at medical
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:42.080]  clinics because here's the deal you got to go to medical clinics and doctors to
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:45.600]  get the super nutraceuticals in many cases that's why I went to group he's
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:48.240]  had one of the biggest labs in the country one of the biggest private
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:51.320]  hospitals until he got out of that you know he's the guy that can actually
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:55.160]  prescribe stuff that is prescription this isn't prescription but it's stuff
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:58.960]  where you have to have doctors involved be able to even talk to the labs that
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:02.400]  haven't I mean it's good to have medical doctors and people just even be able to
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:08.800]  interface and get the licensing to be able to get from Mitsubishi America the
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:14.520]  bio PQQ of the highest quality that cost again $30,000 to make a batch of DNA
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:20.520]  force 12 to $14,000 a kilo this has a huge dose not of the synthetic garbage
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:24.960]  that's out there that's $40 a bottle for a dose lower than just what's in this
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:28.360]  and that's only one of the ingredients so I'm pitching something here to you
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:33.560]  because it's amazing and by the way very soon we're gonna have some major
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:39.440]  athletes and people that I didn't even try to get here who separately tried this
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:44.760]  and separately tried some of the other products that it's been approved through
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:48.480]  the anti-doping agency some of these athletes have to do that the super
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:52.640]  multivitality the DNA force it got approved they used it and they said
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:55.920]  listen I hardly use other supplements because I don't get much of an effect
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:59.960]  this is incredible I want to endorse it so this is an amazing product DNA force
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:03.960]  Dr. Grupp let's spend a few minutes on this this is back in stock explain to
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:09.640]  people why it's such a game changer well you working with your dad you know we
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:15.160]  all we always look at and I always look at doing research what the root cause of
[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:18.920]  all the problems are to begin with and as all the products that you carry that I
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:23.720]  develop for you all address the root cause of a problem for example iodine
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:29.360]  deficiency we have the iodine vitamin D with the vitamin D deficiency we wanted
[02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:33.640]  when you came and you said the one the holy grail you want the holy grail of
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:38.880]  all nutraceutical supplements what is the holy grail of all nutraceutical
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:44.080]  supplements it's got to be something that works on the cellular level right I
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:48.680]  mean because that's all we are is a hundred trillion cells what's inside the
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:54.600]  cell the mitochondria what is the main cause of every single disease out there
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:58.800]  we've talked about it a million times mitochondria finally give up all the
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:02.600]  chemicals in the toxins coming in through the air the food the water the
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:06.960]  beverages everything they come in where through the intestinal tract the
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.880]  intestines are just made up of cells the cardiovascular system made up of cells
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:16.960]  every single system endocrine everything is made up of cells so when we
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:21.160]  looked at the cells and what's happening with the cells and how the cells become
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:25.280]  toxic and the chemicals that are altering the ATP function and the
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:28.880]  chemicals that are coming inside the cell and floating around in the cytoplasm
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:33.920]  and some cells have five mitochondria some cells have thousands of micro
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:38.680]  mitochondria that's the powerhouse of the cell and we started looking at the
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:44.200]  damaging effects of free radicals and chemicals at the intracellular level
[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:49.360]  that was how DNA force was born and by the way we don't make claims on the other
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:53.320]  products other people with vitamins and minerals and supplements too we like to
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:57.800]  be safe again the health Nazi sites and I mean that like Seinfeld you know
[02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:02.040]  soup Nazi the people that are really into the best stuff you are like their
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:06.320]  god I mean they just you are the highest standard with your great products you
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:11.760]  developed and then they sit there they research what's in DNA force they go
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:16.920]  crazy gaga because you can go to the site and see the 70 plus studies all of
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:20.520]  it on what it's known to do so what can we tell people this is known to do
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:24.000]  because I started taking it two years ago when it first came out and again
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.640]  this is true story my finger was chopped off except for the skin on one side when
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:30.960]  I fell off a boat where I was helping some people who had a boat fire and like
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:36.720]  Travis Kevin boot was there was dangling by a piece of skin it was numb this
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:41.400]  just happened about 1415 right before 9-11 it's about 16 years ago for 12
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:45.600]  years or so it was just numb on one side then began to tingle it's really weird
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:49.160]  then it just came back and the feelings all back in my finger that's because this
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:53.840]  is patented to regrow nerves I mean it's incredible there's no doubt this is
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:57.200]  not one of my favorite supplements it probably is my favorite supplement but I
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:02.720]  take everything but this is the reason why it's so expensive first of all my
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:08.760]  number one priority like yours Alex is the customer's health and that's the
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:12.800]  first thing that we look at I want to provide the highest quality best
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:17.520]  ingredients stuff that I know is going to be effective stuff that I know
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:20.960]  individuals are going to get results with and stuff that's going to change
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:27.400]  literally change their health for the for the betterment of their life and so
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:31.040]  they don't have to deal with anything and it starts at the cell if you add up
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:34.480]  all the ingredients that we have in DNA for us and you were to buy those
[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:38.680]  separately you would be spending two probably three hundred dollars because we
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:43.360]  use the highest quality best ingredients and I look it's it's fun to go
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:49.800]  through and read all of the third-party reviews on this product because I was a
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:53.240]  really good was we can't put in there cuz it's a third-party site highly rated
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:58.160]  you know the stuff that you know we have high standards we don't let the reviews
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:01.360]  through that are just incredible so there's people that have had bald spots
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:05.400]  or their hair starts to grow back another big response is that nerve people
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:10.000]  that had nerve damage spinal injuries they regain their feeling people have
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  foot drop all of a sudden that's that's better and they can walk again I mean
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.120]  literally you're creating miracles because what you're doing is you're
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:22.800]  repairing the cells and a lot of the supplements out there aren't focused on
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:29.960]  getting into the cellular mitochondrial regrowth and when the mitochondria dies
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:35.880]  and the cell dies or when new cells come about from that they're even
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:40.280]  unhealthier than the cells before so it's ready to die in emergency divides
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:44.280]  you'll get so many divisions of the telomeres that's when your body shuts
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:48.080]  down that's why they people people look old because their cells are dead and
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:53.480]  dying so what we want to do is when that cell divides we want a healthier cell
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:57.000]  division and let's take for example the digestive tract your cells divide you
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:01.360]  get new cells every 24 hours it's one of the most rapidly dividing cell structure
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:06.920]  just like the skin is the epithelial cells the same ones we want the new
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:11.480]  that's why another big response in the in the reviews is that my skin is
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:19.080]  healthier I look more radiant my nails my hair all of that with the nerve all of
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:22.400]  it's let me ask you this sometimes if I take it I got a pretty tough stomach on
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:26.960]  it stomach though a couple DNA force I get a little bit of a stomach ache that's
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:30.800]  usually because of the enzymes we have in there and the ends I need to take it
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:34.640]  with food so you don't really necessarily need to take it with food but
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.320]  usually that's going to be some imbalance in your stomach you prop your
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:42.520]  hydrochloric acid levels might be off a little bit it's different with
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:46.920]  everybody but that's a good thing that we put those enzymes in there as well
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:51.640]  what we have is we have the biopq q which is found as the original life
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:57.460]  form multi antioxidant mineral that's found in space dust which has in
[02:43:57.460 --> 02:44:03.040]  comments and what is it 50 containers cartons of blueberries don't have this
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:07.240]  much antioxidant power so we have the pitero pure in there too that's it that's
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:11.760]  it which contains different components health-giving components and antioxidants
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:17.760]  that are contained in blueberries the equivalent of 500 cartons of blueberries
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:22.200]  that you would have to eat so really this is an antioxidant it's an anti-aging
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:27.480]  system it's a cellular repair mitochondrial repair and since everything
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:31.560]  starts at the cellular level you're getting all these nutrients into the
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:37.440]  base of that and what we've done with this new batch of DNA force I'm always
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:41.640]  looking for new and exciting things that we can add to these formulas to bring
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:47.040]  the quality up that's why constantly we're looking at improving the quality
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:50.680]  and adding new things that's why it's now DNA force plus though we haven't changed
[02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:55.640]  the label yet so this new DNA force batch has the addition of an omry listed
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:45:01.080]  organic folvic acid and it's just like the shellage that we use as well the
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:06.560]  folvic acid is the base core component of all cellular life it's made from the
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:11.120]  decomposition of plants and that decomposes into a humus structure and
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:16.320]  folvic acid is one of the components of that folvic acid contains 77 different
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:22.320]  base ionic minerals and folvic acid has there you can type in folvic acid
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:27.280]  clinical studies and you're gonna see the benefits China Japan traditional
[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:32.480]  Chinese medicine has used folvic acid for centuries and what folvic acid does is
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:38.280]  it focuses on the cell it hydrates the cell we have a dehydration problem that's
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:42.240]  just as bad as the mystery flew out there we have 90% more than maybe she
[02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:46.080]  admitted that that scurvy is coming back because even people eat fruits and
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:49.440]  vegetables their guts are so dead with no flora they're not absorbing and are
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:56.400]  breaking it down so what is folvic acid do trance helps transport essential
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:02.760]  vitamins minerals amino acids into the cell okay so it's like the 18 wheeler
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:08.560]  delivering and it pushes out toxic materials from the cell they did a study
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:13.080]  I can't remember where it was on fish that swim in water high in folvic acid
[02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:17.960]  they had six times less the metals and aluminum in their body because they were
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:23.080]  exposed to folvic acid we have we had in the DNA force and didn't even increase
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:26.800]  the price or anything this is an added benefit and it's on the label on the
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:30.040]  back we haven't changed the main level on the front to call it DNA force plus
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:34.920]  we have a limited run and again it does have so many things in it that are hard
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:39.360]  to source hard to get that's why we're sold out half the time of DNA force it's
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:42.120]  just because the formula is that good folks that's not a gimmick where we're
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:45.600]  sold out all the time of some of these key things it's the more complex the
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:50.360]  product is the harder it is to get the truly pure clean organic the harder it
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:54.480]  is to pass all the standards and when we don't we just don't put it out I mean
[02:46:54.480 --> 02:46:58.840]  nobody else does that that's that is true quality control right there that is
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:03.680]  true I would love to have sources but our rigorous process of vetting sources
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:07.440]  for these products and getting these materials in and it's only getting worse
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:12.480]  across the industry because everybody is trying to jump into the nutraceutical
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:16.680]  and ride the organic bandwagon right now you have pharmaceutical companies that
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:20.640]  are in bet investing hundreds of billions of dollars right now into the
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:23.920]  probiotic and we now have big pharma contacting us saying hey we want to work
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:28.560]  with you with our laboratories I mean it's just crazy it is crazy but the good
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:33.360]  thing is if you a lot of those pharmaceutical companies and people they
[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:38.680]  don't they don't have the 20 years of background into looking at raw materials
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:42.000]  they don't know how to properly vet the raw materials and what they want to do
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:45.200]  is they want to patent something they want to take something change it their
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:50.680]  own probiotic a man-made probiotic that they can patent and then sell listen it
[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:56.520]  goes back to nature nature is our medicine everything nature is the next
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:03.840]  thing nature is the high-tech nature not drugs nature info wars life calm
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:09.000]  powered by nature not drugs exactly and that's why the the globalists and the
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:12.680]  in the powers to be out that's that's not hype of course we're even allowed to
[02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:15.920]  say that because that's in the studies how did bio PQQ I'm there's much other
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:22.760]  stuff in there how did how did it make my finger nerve come back in because
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:28.240]  bio PQQ activates the cells in the mitochondrial level and starts
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:35.400]  repairing so as your nerve cells start to reproduce every time they reproduce
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:38.360]  that's why it was a slow process and it started going to a little bit of a
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:42.320]  tingling feeling and then after a period of time it came back because the
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:46.840]  next generation of cells were stronger and they were healthier if you look at
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:50.720]  the stairway to health where you're sitting here and you're eating and
[02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:54.480]  exposed to all these chemicals and toxins most people are standing still or
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:48:58.120]  they're going down one stair every day and that's why they're sick they're
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:01.920]  debilitated they're getting degenerative diseases they're on pharmaceuticals and
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:07.440]  they're slowly dying if you start looking at providing the body with the
[02:49:07.440 --> 02:49:12.440]  essential things that is deficient in like the iodine and and like the winter
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:18.840]  sun and and then focusing also at the cellular level so you can absorb all
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:23.760]  those things into the cell properly you can hydrate the cell properly then you
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:29.720]  get cellular activation you get and so just like your body just like your body
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:34.120]  it's almost like stem cells and it's oxygen we need these things you need all
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:38.840]  these compounds in your cell I picked all the compounds that you need in your
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:41.440]  cell that's a great point they're talking about like all these cancers and
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:45.560]  heart attacks and and heart death being reversed with stem cells well how do you
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:51.600]  just activate your stem cells you give your cells what they need to to produce
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:55.720]  said they go pulling out of somebody else and put them in you exactly it's
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:58.880]  amazing I want to go to break and come back and talk more about the chem

[02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:55.440]  while so much of the public is asleep I guess when they brainwashed us that you
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:59.480]  know we need to take care of our country that's why we're really wanting to take
[02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:03.280]  care of our country and we really do we really are passionate about it and and
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:09.360]  we spend all of our time every single day just trying to help the environment
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:13.520]  and help everybody live a healthy life I mean it's just it's amazing when you
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:17.960]  just walk around and you see people and you just want to walk up to them it's
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:23.560]  it's just the sheeple out there that are just you see mothers pushing around
[02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:28.480]  little babies and in their lap they have a big bag of Cheetos and a 62 ounce
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:32.200]  Coca-Cola and you're thinking to yourself oh my gosh look at that baby
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:36.960]  drinking all that high fructose corn syrup and eating all that MSG and no
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:41.560]  wonder the general public seems so brain dead yeah I mean if you're breathing
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:45.400]  the chemicals every single day you're eating the chemicals every single day
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:54.160]  you're you know exposed to stress from the negative aspect of the median you
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:57.800]  ultimately you're just gonna be sick and you're gonna sure how do I do that and
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:01.040]  we're gonna go to break and come back and play this trailer because I feel it's
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:04.840]  positive to fight the tearing to cover the evil the corruption so to expose it
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:08.000]  to stop it but it does have a negative effect even though I realize it's
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:13.440]  positive to do still it gets to me personally how do you do what you do and
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:18.600]  not have it weigh you down well one of the things I do is meditate every day
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:22.720]  and that helps out tremendously I try to meditate at least you know when I'm
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:25.640]  starting to feel stressed out I'll just stop what I'm doing and have a
[02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:28.760]  meditation chair in my office I turn the lights off and go over there and just
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:32.520]  meditate for the first five minutes my brain is going a million miles an hour
[02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:37.120]  and I'm I can't believe this is going on but then I just it calm it really calms
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:40.520]  me down and let me learn to get centered just focus yeah just just centered and
[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:45.880]  focus and I tell you what one of the most common reviews product reviews for
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:51.080]  DNA force is the fact that it calms you down I went through all the reviews on
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:55.640]  your site and and kind of came up with the top five and honestly just about
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:58:00.120]  every review mentions how they're suffering from anxiety and stress and
[02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:05.120]  one of the biggest things that it does is calms them down keep some focused and
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:10.600]  keep some happy because your body picks up when it's not operating properly yeah
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:14.560]  exactly of course it does but when you repair the cells the cells can then
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:19.400]  produce the dopamine and the serotonin and produce all the good compounds that
[02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:23.040]  your body the normal high we're supposed to have on life alter the amount of
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:26.440]  stress that everything God gave us is just the pleasure of life the pleasure
[02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:29.600]  of raising children the pleasure of kinship the pleasure of men and women
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:34.440]  together I mean it's just all one giant blessing when we follow God's plan back

[03:00:20.520 --> 03:00:28.520]  final segment with myself and then dr. griffin anthony you should already are coming in part of the fact that things get confused here is why we're so successful
[03:00:28.520 --> 03:00:46.520]  you know first was gonna be david night host the fourth hour and then we realized hey you're here we were gonna have a meeting about new product development and then i realized i'm going to have another meeting like 3 30 so i can't be here now if you host the fourth hour but we'll just do it again tomorrow over the phone and you know the sign that we do get confused and
[03:00:46.520 --> 03:01:01.520]  you know the sign that we're booked is the sign that we're taking action there was a big study out on that just last week showing that fact people that don't want the animating contest of liberty they're already dying what do we do in closing here about the tv sickness the screen
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:15.520]  sickness the iq dropping this whole matrix like society that we do live in how do we stay focused and not to get brain damaged by that pay attention to yourself i mean so many people are focused on
[03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:22.520]  are focused on so many outside things they're focused on their work they're focused on their family they're focused on
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:34.520]  going to the doctor's office getting on medications to bring it all back in and say what's really important to me instead of spending hours watching the news at night or watching a bunch of shows on tv
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:52.520]  those are hours you could be spending taking care of yourself spending time with your kids prioritize your life you know god family yourself if you're sick if you're not taking care of yourself nothing else in your life is going to be functioning properly that you're going to have problems with your family your work everything
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:02:07.520]  one of the things that i've learned is that the healthier you are and the more you look at yourself and controlling your stress levels and focusing on yourself the happier you become as a person and the more you get in control yourself i'm still a mess but compared to
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:21.520]  myself five years ago it's like an eighty eighty percent is better and now the last twenty percent it's easier and easier and look at everything around you that's benefited from just getting my kids need healthier they behave so much better
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:33.520]  it's amazing you know i dropped the ball hopefully you guys will cover this some this is a bombshell robert deniro was threatened we have this directly from andrew wakefield to not show their film you know his son obviously was autistic from it
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:43.520]  he was going to show it they went after him i wondered man what did take threatened to narrow he's pretty powerful he was threatened by the government wakefield gave us the exclusive the article just went up and i didn't even plug it
[03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:59.520]  i tell you what i hope everybody watches watches vaxxed from wakefield who has been under so much scrutiny in the last ever since he started his anti vaccine campaigns and education of people are for and he's been proving correct
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:15.520]  he's been proven absolutely correct speaking of films let's go out to break and you'll come back with anthony with the trailer of the new film revelation with charlie daniels general boykin alex jones and more
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:31.520]  first things i remember frosty carolina mourners of the cheery fire crackling of my mama's big blackwood cook stove i'm charlie daniels today something's wrong and we all know it the nation has been hijacked by international forces
[03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:47.520]  boom i got shot through the shoulder my first thought was damn that hurts even hollywood couldn't make up stuff like this the people of the world are waiting for americans to wake up
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:04:07.520]  we the people have the right to keep and bear arms the average citizen is photographed 300 times per day uh the fansans right here beheadings uh beatings uh torturing uh burning people in barrels
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:19.520]  is indicative i think of their confidence now that it doesn't matter if this is open we'll have some power here that they can't take us down the biggest stumbling block to this plan is the united states of america
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:45.520]  why is that because we have a tradition of individual freedom and liberty we have to protect america and the american way of life first world government is only the beginning the caucus crowed friends denial will not stand once they have control they plan on absolutely dehumanizing humanity
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:53.520]  and that's just one of the trailers is another powerful trailer on info wars dot com we'll be back on the other side with doctor group and hands on the gucciardi

[03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:37.520]  he is far behind both trump and crews in the delegate count hannity asked prebus if he thought republican voters would feel outright anger frustration and a sense of betrayal if trump had a 400 delegate leave but was not given the nomination
[03:05:37.520 --> 03:05:57.520]  prebus reflected the question referring to previous brokered conventions the establishment both left and right they're willing to go as far as bringing in the guy in last place a little red caboose and allowing him to represent you in the presidential election you can find more reports like this info wars dot com i'm joe biggs

[03:08:20.520 --> 03:08:36.520]  and i hope that we're back as the fourth hour i'm anthony good shardy we're gonna keep going on with dr group into overdrive we've got a lot of news that alex didn't cover in fact he's bringing in more as we speak right now including festival threatened by quote high government officials
[03:08:36.520 --> 03:08:51.520]  not to show anti vaccine from paul joseph watson and we've got some more but with moral haggard dying today which is surreal when an icon dies there is an element of surrealism that goes along with it and you wonder you know what is he
[03:08:51.520 --> 03:09:02.520]  thinking on his death bed when he had pneumonia multiple times double pneumonia ended up dying today on his birthday and you wonder about jeez it's kind of absurd when you look up his name
[03:09:02.520 --> 03:09:08.520]  i don't see my political correctness tax sorry no worries hey it's live it's teleprompter yeah absolutely there it is thank you
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:15.520]  well they are banning everything because it's what would they just ban again they're just banning raising your hands in england is not racist in class
[03:09:15.520 --> 03:09:22.520]  well it makes sense i had my whole stack from today and i swear it was in here and i ran out i was telling you guys keep going sorry that's alright
[03:09:22.520 --> 03:09:33.520]  could be in here too alright hey it's live it's awesome right no we got panama papers british banker funded north korean arms but on the moral haggard thing
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:47.520]  it's crazy when an icon dies because you think about both the vastness and the kind of routine aspect such as if you look up moral haggard wikipedia and a bunch of other websites
[03:09:47.520 --> 03:09:57.520]  automatically change so it goes from in the matter of minutes you'll always notice this if someone dies on wikipedia he was and they just put you know death in their instant
[03:09:57.520 --> 03:10:06.520]  like within minutes they have it all done it's like jeez in a matter of minutes his entire profiles change to you know his legacy and he what he did in his life
[03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:15.520]  and how he died today and everything and you wonder what are these people thinking on their death bed right someone accomplished like him sure thinking of all the a lot of really amazing
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:23.520]  things he did but what are his regrets and what are people thinking on their death bed when they have something like double pneumonia and remind me of this story from huffington post
[03:10:23.520 --> 03:10:32.520]  that was one of the most shared articles of last year the top five regrets of the dying and then we're going to get into this news so here are the top five regrets of people on their death bed
[03:10:32.520 --> 03:10:42.520]  they did an actual study and they figured these were the top five regrets isn't this interesting so number one the number one regret from people on their death bed is
[03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:52.520]  I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself not the life others expected of me number two is I wish I hadn't worked so hard
[03:10:52.520 --> 03:11:03.520]  number three is I wish I'd had the courage to express myself number four is I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends number five is I wish that I had let myself be happier
[03:11:03.520 --> 03:11:14.520]  so it's something to consider the top five regrets of the dying with moral Haggard passing away reminds me of this story top five regrets of the dying and consider that while you're living instead of on your death bed
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:28.520]  now tell you what just to just to comment on that that's why time is so valuable because time is something you never get back you know you can you know lose money and make money again you there's
[03:11:28.520 --> 03:11:37.520]  anything else in life in the physical you can lose your house or get a new house or anything like that but time is so important somebody once said to me
[03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:48.520]  you know when I had kids you're really only going to have about six Christmases with your kid because your kid won't understand Christmas until their three and by the time they're nine they know
[03:11:48.520 --> 03:12:01.520]  you know about Christmas and everything so you know every moment is so precious because whatever you lost today is is gone you know so that's why you really need to take advantage of
[03:12:01.520 --> 03:12:15.520]  you think to yourself you're stressed out you're angry and everything usually everything works itself out anyway and then you look back two weeks later when you suffered from all this stress and anxiety and anger and emotional problems and then
[03:12:15.520 --> 03:12:25.520]  you know later on you're saying I just was under so much pressure and stress and anger for two weeks what did that do to my body and now everything's okay anyway
[03:12:25.520 --> 03:12:36.520]  you know those are those are all really good things that people should look at in their life and appreciate time and appreciate every minute that they have I that's why I try to
[03:12:36.520 --> 03:12:50.520]  you know yes there's a million things going on yes I want to help change the world yes I want to you know be an activist and one of the one of the biggest victories actually that we've had on this planet is the fact that the
[03:12:50.520 --> 03:13:10.520]  dark act the GMO labeling failed in the Senate and they by one vote I mean that's that's got to be one of the biggest progressions that we've made in the healthcare and the environment and food supply ever so it's little things like that that you work so hard on
[03:13:10.520 --> 03:13:19.520]  but then don't forget about the little things and don't forget about the people that are important to you and don't forget about yourself either you have to take time to reflect and realize all the things you've done all the things you've worked
[03:13:19.520 --> 03:13:32.520]  towards all the things as a collective intellectual revolution that we've achieved you know no matter what that is yeah you and I both were on Capitol Hill giving a speech about the dark act and and that's that's been
[03:13:32.520 --> 03:13:47.520]  accomplished when Monsanto and the companies put in $50 million the Grocers Association to lobby against it I mean that's a huge win and a huge loss for them and then General Mills coming out and announcing they're going to start labeling and these companies that are not going to be putting
[03:13:47.520 --> 03:14:01.520]  any more genetically modified foods that's pure activism at the heart of what we're all about changing the world and more and more people are realizing that and it's it's not me or you that made that change happen
[03:14:01.520 --> 03:14:12.520]  it's everybody out there that's making a difference that sent all those letters to the Senators and that are proponents of spreading the word and educating everybody they know about those
[03:14:12.520 --> 03:14:26.520]  and even if you don't care about GMOs or you don't care about health and you think they're great just think about what that represents a company that is making multi-billions of dollars and then shelling out tens of millions or hundreds of millions over you know long spent
[03:14:26.520 --> 03:14:37.520]  of time to stop these things from happening to stop labeling initiatives and all that and then a grassroots initiative not multi-powerful you know omnipotent companies going against another one
[03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:45.520]  but grassroots people like the March Against Monsanto woman who's just a housewife that just you know her kids were eating junk and she said well gee there's an issue with this
[03:14:45.520 --> 03:15:00.520]  it's grassroots people so again even if you don't care about health aspect of it or the GMO aspect of it it's representative it's representative of everything right it's representative in the political world where no one is standing for the political correctness anymore
[03:15:00.520 --> 03:15:13.520]  where no one is standing for the fake politicians anymore where Congress's approval rating is in the toilet and nobody likes any of the most of the candidates because they're up there you know flapping around talking like a puppet
[03:15:13.520 --> 03:15:26.520]  so people are tired of it and it's representative of the overall revolution that I see happening and that's why things are happening like threats from high level government officials to not show certain films or whatever and again even if you don't agree with the films
[03:15:26.520 --> 03:15:40.520]  I'm not even sure I agree with this film that was going to be shown but the truth is you should be allowed to show things as long as it's not you know direct defamation or libel or whatever that expands people's reality and make them question the reality
[03:15:40.520 --> 03:15:52.520]  because if we're not doing that constantly that's how we get into the world we're in now where we're essentially just going into an establishment meat grinder right where we're told our entire lives this is how we have to live this is how we have to behave
[03:15:52.520 --> 03:16:05.520]  and if we don't stop it too then next thing you know new things will be coming out that we just didn't even see in the first place and now children around the world are spending less time outdoors than prisoners
[03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:16.520]  for 80 years young Americans have been depressed and anxious and no one is quite sure why and on the tech realm which I think could be a good thing but also a bad thing Samsung patents smart contact lenses with built-in cameras
[03:16:16.520 --> 03:16:28.520]  and Nvidia is powering the world's first self-driving race car so there's all this stuff happening all this development a lot of amazing powerful things a lot of ridiculous things going on at the same time
[03:16:28.520 --> 03:16:37.520]  and we're just sitting here and if we don't analyze our position and refocus and say wait a minute okay let's let's get back to the foundation of what needs to be changed and what needs to be fixed
[03:16:37.520 --> 03:16:46.520]  and reclaim our you know personal freedoms and really just push forward in human empowerment it's not going to be a very good time I don't think
[03:16:46.520 --> 03:16:56.520]  there's a lot of good and a lot of bad happening and has been happening for the last couple not last couple years for the last 10, 15, 20 years it just seems to be getting worse and worse
[03:16:56.520 --> 03:17:16.520]  but the same time things are getting better I mean we are in these times all of us everybody's listening to this show and many people around the world we are part of that revolution I mean we're right in the middle of this movement this revolution this change that's happening right now for the better
[03:17:16.520 --> 03:17:34.520]  and when our children and their children look back the history books the history books that are going to be written in the future in the next 20 years 30 years 40 years are going to be talking about this what we're involved with right now they're going to be like this was the
[03:17:34.520 --> 03:17:54.520]  core of the revolution that changed the world and the teachers are going to be teaching about this it's like the you know the Civil War World War two or the Vietnam War whatever this is going to be the revolution the health care revolution the revolution that the people took back their
[03:17:54.520 --> 03:18:12.520]  own rights and the Constitution comes back to the original Constitution and all these different bills and all this stuff that has taken over our rights to do most anything I mean they can just declare martial law we have no rights at all so the good thing is when you think
[03:18:12.520 --> 03:18:30.520]  about that and you think about the future at least that's what I think about it's like you know years people aren't really recognized until years and years and years later I mean we think back of Tesla and Einstein right now and what they did and all the changes that are written about from all of the great
[03:18:30.520 --> 03:18:46.520]  leaders in history they're not recognized till 20 30 40 years down the road Van Gogh only sold a single painting in his lifetime a single painting for a very small amount what would be nowadays about $1000 Tesla was definitely an outcast you know some some recognition
[03:18:46.520 --> 03:19:04.520]  Jefferson just completely outshadowed him Tesla was an outcast all of the great figures that we now you know say how smart Galileo okay all these figures that we look at and say what what revolutionary intellectual just powerhouses how amazing they were generally outcasts
[03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:19.520]  ignored hated over and over and over again they would have all been diagnosed with autism or ADD definitely crazy people definitely crazy they would have all been and for the record I don't I'm I'm not saying I don't think you're saying that we're anywhere near these people at any capacity I think
[03:19:19.520 --> 03:19:34.520]  it's more about the movement itself intellectual revolution towards personal freedom towards human empowerment away from the mega bureaucracies taking control of everything and looking at everything you're doing and telling you what you can and can't do in a boiling point like you said where the legislation is just so
[03:19:34.520 --> 03:19:49.520]  absurd and the politicians are just so corrupt that it cannot last anymore so it's a peaceful information based revolution that is absolutely coming so we're going to come back we're going to take some phone calls to give out the number when we come back and talk about this high government official shutting down a film we're back with

[03:24:40.520 --> 03:25:01.520]  we're taking calls throughout the entire hour also we're going to talk about is something that Dr. Group and talked about this a little bit before but this is just another example of something where someone says something that is actually an expert and understands how it works that's against the so-called status quo of the of the verdict right
[03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:23.520]  it's the establishment view on something and they're called crazy now you might have been called crazy in your life before for something maybe something minor by a few people in your life or for a few days or a few months but imagine being called crazy for 20 years on something that you know you're right about and having the courage to continue stating it over and over
[03:25:23.520 --> 03:25:42.520]  and over again what even though everyone's calling you crazy even though your your friends your md friends your surgeons are calling you insane on stuff and that is not to just you know to your own horn for you but that's what you've done for about over 20 years on gut health saying it's the center of everything it has to do with your mood it has to do with your your mental health
[03:25:42.520 --> 03:26:01.520]  even saying this I mean definitely since I've known you what now 20 something how many years 20 plus years and every single time it seems like it comes out later and later and later but look at this the New York Times magazine can the bacteria in your gut explain your mood the rich array of
[03:26:01.520 --> 03:26:16.520]  microbiota in our intestines can tell us more than you might think this is just one piece that I printed off I used you know I've done another segment on this where I'd like 20 pieces mental health may depend on creatures in the gut scientific American who would totally be your biggest
[03:26:16.520 --> 03:26:32.520]  saying mental health may depend on creatures in the gut and of course that big paper we talked about before where it's basically that your entire health your predisposition to many diseases is based on the microbiome in your gut which is totally central to everything you've been
[03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:47.520]  totally central and it's routine in every single one of your protocols but you're insane your bad person how dare you run clinics for the past 20 years and help people and teach them about this stuff very upsetting what you have to say about yourself
[03:26:47.520 --> 03:27:07.520]  I've been saying for a long time the closely guarded top secret of the medical profession is gut health is something they never want you to find out about because I'm not a super genius or anything like that I just am a research
[03:27:07.520 --> 03:27:25.520]  scientist I look at the root cause of problems and in my quest years and years and years ago to find the root cause of disease and actually back then my goal was cancer I was like the one I was called the first alternative oncologist in the nation
[03:27:25.520 --> 03:27:44.520]  because we were focusing with our research team on what's the real root cause of cancer and how can we prevent cancer and that led us to every other disease because when we figured out the root cause of cancer that also led us to the solution on how to prevent
[03:27:44.520 --> 03:28:05.520]  and what to do if you know what causes disease it's easy to learn how to rectify that and my first book was health begins in the colon disease starts in the colon the gut and I was called everything my office was raided by the FDA I was almost thrown in jail I had black cars following me around
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:19.520]  and let's be clear let's be clear let's talk for a minute so when you say the medical system doesn't want you to know this to me you know I have lots of MD friends couple surgeon friends couple dentist friends they in my view they get it
[03:28:19.520 --> 03:28:35.520]  okay what some of them are integrated I think most doctors most doctors have good intentions I think most doctors have good intentions they want to help people I think it's the big mega drug companies that have been caught time and time again it's not a conspiracy theory
[03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:50.520]  okay it's not a conspiracy theory they've been caught time and time again getting rid of the drug trials trials and by the way I think sometimes we should take pharmaceutical drugs if you have a really bad infection take an antibiotic I don't know if you agree with me on that I think sometimes they're good sometimes they're good okay sometimes people need them
[03:28:50.520 --> 03:29:06.520]  but I'm just backing up your point explaining it in a way that look there's billions of dollars at stake there's billions of dollars at stake how much money would be lost if everyone got their gut health right and then here here's a point to everyone says well if it was just that easy everybody would do it
[03:29:06.520 --> 03:29:22.520]  well really because it's it's actually kind of easy to lose weight you eat less and you work out every day but how many people are obese well gee if it's just that easy well it's not just that easy but you can do it right but there are billions of dollars of interest money wedging against you
[03:29:22.520 --> 03:29:35.520]  hedging against you in a Las Vegas bet that you're not going to do it right they've got a blackjack table there's throwing billions down just hoping that you're not going to do it psychological warfare exactly so we'll be right back and continue on the subject with Dr. Group this is the Alex
[03:29:35.520 --> 03:29:37.520]  Jones show

[03:30:39.520 --> 03:30:54.520]  we have heard this type of language before with massive leaks including the classified national security agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden well there you have it again George Soros trying to manipulate what it is you see here and believe this is out of control

[03:33:18.520 --> 03:33:21.520]  so talk about the definition of live radio
[03:33:21.520 --> 03:33:28.520]  alex just walked in with facebook mentions going which is the live streaming service on facebook on his alex jones page started talking to us
[03:33:28.520 --> 03:33:30.520]  and that's always a lot of fun
[03:33:30.520 --> 03:33:35.520]  i think i personally think that facebook mentions is an awesome tool to reach people
[03:33:35.520 --> 03:33:40.520]  so if you're not on there if not on alex's facebook sign on and watch his mentions
[03:33:40.520 --> 03:33:46.520]  probably competing with us right now but you know what that's alright watch this don't go there don't watch him we're more entertaining
[03:33:46.520 --> 03:33:51.520]  so we're gonna talk more about this gut health connection we've been talking about what our doctor group's been doing for 20 years
[03:33:51.520 --> 03:33:53.520]  is talking about gut health how it's the center of everything
[03:33:53.520 --> 03:34:04.520]  now we're gonna take some of your calls on adrenals energy supplements to help with memory heart issues nerve damage inflammation lots of lots of stuff
[03:34:04.520 --> 03:34:13.520]  so doctor group just finishing up we're talking about scientific american new york times pretty much every news outlet ever is now putting out stories
[03:34:13.520 --> 03:34:21.520]  that gut health is really really important it's pretty much the center of your health the microbiome the way in which it affects your mood
[03:34:21.520 --> 03:34:27.520]  stuff you've been saying for years i've only been saying it probably for five years or four years you've been saying it for 20 years
[03:34:27.520 --> 03:34:30.520]  so you're kind of like the grandfather of this
[03:34:30.520 --> 03:34:34.520]  yeah i'm not really the grandfather of it because if you look back in history
[03:34:34.520 --> 03:34:36.520]  you know hypocrisy
[03:34:36.520 --> 03:34:45.520]  you know three thousand years twenty five hundred years ago the modern the grandfather of the modern push the thing is the the medical communities
[03:34:45.520 --> 03:34:53.520]  burned all kinds of books in the 1930s and 40s because this is what those doctors were talking about with all the chemicals that were being developed
[03:34:53.520 --> 03:35:02.520]  starting well with the AMA in 1898 with fishbine really trying to suppress one of their main missions was to suppress natural medicine
[03:35:02.520 --> 03:35:09.520]  because they knew it was a threat they closed down all the mineral spas around the country they started burning all the books
[03:35:09.520 --> 03:35:15.520]  i've tracked down a lot of those books from the 1920s and 1930s all the way up to the 1950s
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:21.520]  and guess what they were saying the same exact thing that we're saying now eat a clean diet eat organic foods
[03:35:21.520 --> 03:35:28.520]  cleanse your body on a regular basis keep they used to just have people eat dirt to get the probiotics in their system
[03:35:28.520 --> 03:35:36.520]  nowadays the soil is contaminated with all kinds of other things but the good news is that's what we're here for to develop these things to
[03:35:36.520 --> 03:35:45.520]  to give people the solutions they need and yes i always have been a big gut proponent because everything starts in the gut
[03:35:45.520 --> 03:35:53.520]  your gut is connected to every single organ your gut is the largest endocrine organ that you have
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:36:01.520]  the surface area of the size of a tennis court in your gut and your gut is a whole living world it's your connection to the outside
[03:36:01.520 --> 03:36:08.520]  when you put stuff in from the outside it's supposed to go in get processed and come out the other side and everything that you don't want to use
[03:36:08.520 --> 03:36:16.520]  the problem is with all the chemicals and everything else that we're ingesting on a regular basis
[03:36:16.520 --> 03:36:25.520]  it's burning holes in the gut wall causing leaky gut syndrome and people aren't chewing their food properly and all of these issues are burning the gut
[03:36:25.520 --> 03:36:33.520]  destroying the gut and that's why I've always said the first point is to clean the gut when you want to repair your health
[03:36:33.520 --> 03:36:41.520]  put back in the proper probiotics that you need on a regular basis cleanse it with an oxygen based colon cleanser like oxy powder
[03:36:41.520 --> 03:36:49.520]  iodine is extremely important for the gut health tissue once you repair the gut a lot of the other problems start going away and going away
[03:36:49.520 --> 03:36:57.520]  and now you're seeing mainstream they just can't hide it anymore okay because they're looking bad you know all these people are saying
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:04.520]  well why didn't we have the best scientists in the world the best pharmaceutical companies that are working on all this why aren't they saying anything about that
[03:37:04.520 --> 03:37:13.520]  oh you know it's so funny you said that the one main article about this that started all this again where they came out and said that there was a predisposition to heart disease and cancer or whatever
[03:37:13.520 --> 03:37:20.520]  if you don't have a good microbiome in your body the guy I think it was from AstraZeneca maybe we can pull it up we made a big deal of it a while ago
[03:37:20.520 --> 03:37:29.520]  the guy from AstraZeneca said if you would have told me I'm paraphrasing if you would have told me five years ago there was a link between gut health
[03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:35.520]  and the development of disease and the prevention of disease I would have laughed at you or I would have laughed
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:44.520]  well you know he wouldn't have laughed at us and funny I took that quote actually I took that quote with an image and took that and then a headline of an article I wrote five years ago
[03:37:44.520 --> 03:37:55.520]  called like you know probiotics essential for health and mental or what function or whatever and put his quote on top right like if you would have told me that he's the lead researcher for AstraZeneca
[03:37:55.520 --> 03:38:02.520]  whatever the company was you know not to throw out the wrong company but he was one of the top guys top scientist for the drug company like if you would have told me five years ago
[03:38:02.520 --> 03:38:11.520]  what about four thousand years ago because you are right I mean this has been ancient medicine and I don't want to keep harping on this for too long let's take a call but this has been ancient medicine
[03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:17.520]  there's just you are reinvigorating the lost art in a lot of ways
[03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:27.520]  they know all the medical community all the pharmaceutical companies they know they're losing out they're seeing thousands millions of dollars going to the natural industry
[03:38:27.520 --> 03:38:38.520]  every single month every single day probably people are proactively wanting to get off their pharmaceuticals because they know that they're just a bandaid they're not addressing the root cause of the problem
[03:38:38.520 --> 03:38:44.520]  and they're moving towards natural things so they're in a panic right now how are they gonna make money in the future
[03:38:44.520 --> 03:38:55.520]  well they have to embrace some of these natural things that's why they're putting hundreds of millions of dollars into all these studies for guts and they're trying to come up with their own patented probiotic strains
[03:38:55.520 --> 03:38:58.520]  and they're looking into the hemp compounds the cannabinoids
[03:38:58.520 --> 03:39:09.520]  so they can continue to profit because they see where the money is going they see where the people are going that people are becoming more health conscious they can't suppress it anymore
[03:39:09.520 --> 03:39:21.520]  and all the internet and all the information technology that's out there people are taking more responsibility for their own health they're doing more research they're not just believing what their doctor says and saying
[03:39:21.520 --> 03:39:36.520]  okay I'm just again maybe it's not even their doctors what they saw an ad on CNN about try this medication it may kill you and make symptoms worse and give you 16 brain aneurysms but try it and it's like smiling old women like oh it's so beautiful right
[03:39:36.520 --> 03:39:47.520]  so that's when they go in there like sure let me type that online and it's like 16 pages that are CPC like paid for advertising on Google by that company and they read it and it's like well let me see is this a good choice for me
[03:39:47.520 --> 03:39:56.520]  it's like it's absolutely a good choice for you it's awesome and there's this disclaimer at the bottom of the website like this will actually give you 15 heart attacks don't take it if you're doing anything or drinking any alcohol at all
[03:39:56.520 --> 03:40:05.520]  and you're like awesome then you go to the doctor and again I have friends or doctors who will tell me this the patients will go in and they'll say can I get such and such and the doctors say
[03:40:05.520 --> 03:40:12.520]  well that's maybe not right for you maybe you should try this preventative stuff first or maybe a lighter or something and they're like no I want this
[03:40:12.520 --> 03:40:22.520]  so that's what they're also dealing with they're dealing with people that now that you can directly advertise pharmaceutical drugs to consumers who are uneducated on the subject of no idea what it is truly truly no idea what it is
[03:40:22.520 --> 03:40:29.520]  I mean if you ask people what pharmaceuticals they're taking and they say okay such and such and such and such say well do you know what is even in that
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:37.520]  like you wouldn't go to the store and buy I mean presumably buy a huge tub of food that just says food
[03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:49.520]  and I was like what's in that you know like 99.99% of the population on prescription medications you can say can you tell me the ingredients in that prescription medication you're taking
[03:40:49.520 --> 03:40:57.520]  they'll just say the brand name say well no what's in it actually they have no idea they have no clue what they're taking they don't look at the interactions or anything
[03:40:57.520 --> 03:41:03.520]  and that is the scary part and the doctors some of them will say well I tell them not to you know they don't want they demand it
[03:41:03.520 --> 03:41:06.520]  and they'll find other doctors it's called doctor shopping it's a real thing
[03:41:06.520 --> 03:41:16.520]  95% of the pharmaceutical medications out there damage the gut cause constipation damage the gut lining
[03:41:16.520 --> 03:41:19.520]  even basic pain relievers and stuff alright let's jump to some of these calls
[03:41:19.520 --> 03:41:29.520]  so he's got Ryan in Illinois and he wants to talk about energy and the adrenals which I think is kind of like the gut it's essential and it's kind of a core function to a lot of things
[03:41:29.520 --> 03:41:31.520]  and anyway Ryan what's on your mind?
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:42.520]  Yeah I'm a graphic designer I always feel tired when I go to work and on the way I usually think that coffee will help but it doesn't help me with my energy
[03:41:42.520 --> 03:41:52.520]  and I still feel kind of sleepy I don't know if it's hypothyroidism like my dad has or vitamin D levels what are you guys saying?
[03:41:52.520 --> 03:41:53.520]  Anything doctor group?
[03:41:53.520 --> 03:42:02.520]  Yeah Ryan you and millions of other people are suffering from low energy and fatigue around the country a lot of it has to do with stress
[03:42:02.520 --> 03:42:09.520]  but more importantly it has to do with your body's ability to communicate between organ systems
[03:42:09.520 --> 03:42:18.520]  so what I've found is the first thing that people need to do when they're suffering from low energy levels is to cleanse everything out of their body
[03:42:18.520 --> 03:42:27.520]  because if you look at the root cause of it your endocrine system is not functioning properly and that could be because of a bunch of different endocrine disrupting chemicals
[03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:33.520]  it could be because of stress, high toxins in the food, multiple, multiple things
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:41.520]  but I can tell you this low energy levels are directly associated with toxemia which means your liver is not functioning properly
[03:42:41.520 --> 03:42:51.520]  your liver is congested again going back to the bow you'd be amazed at how much energy people get after they do a colon cleanse
[03:42:51.520 --> 03:43:00.520]  an intestinal cleanse for six days then what I say to do for low energy levels is to do at least one liver cleanse if not three liver cleanses
[03:43:00.520 --> 03:43:11.520]  because the liver is your main functioning organ that processes your nutrients, helps you break down fats, helps you assimilate different things
[03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:19.520]  neutralizes toxins coming in so once your body is clean and your self healing mechanism becomes active again
[03:43:19.520 --> 03:43:27.520]  then your energy levels will start coming back up so all in all what you're doing is you're addressing the root cause of your energy levels
[03:43:27.520 --> 03:43:35.520]  when you take medications that are stimulants like Adderall or something or you take coffee, anything like that
[03:43:35.520 --> 03:43:44.520]  all you're doing is you're putting a stimulant into your body which is going to synthetically increase your metabolism or give you that energy burst
[03:43:44.520 --> 03:43:48.520]  I tell you what a big huge problem is right now is energy drinks
[03:43:48.520 --> 03:43:50.520]  doesn't that just obliterate your adrenals?
[03:43:50.520 --> 03:43:57.520]  it obliterates your adrenal glands over a period of time but your adrenal glands are an endocrine organ
[03:43:57.520 --> 03:43:58.520]  and they're so tiny
[03:43:58.520 --> 03:43:59.520]  just like your thyroid is
[03:43:59.520 --> 03:44:06.520]  people don't realize you think about these big powerful adrenal glands they're like what are they they're super tiny they're super easy to tax out
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:11.520]  and it's also I guess a paradoxical would be the terminology for the paradoxical situation Ryan
[03:44:11.520 --> 03:44:17.520]  where and I've been in this before where you're tired because you're working all day working all day
[03:44:17.520 --> 03:44:20.520]  too tired to work out but then guess what happens when you don't do anything
[03:44:20.520 --> 03:44:22.520]  you get more tired
[03:44:22.520 --> 03:44:28.520]  it's almost like if you could break through that that function too it's like you have to actually get up and do something
[03:44:28.520 --> 03:44:30.520]  if you're sitting around all day it sounds like you're a graphic designer
[03:44:30.520 --> 03:44:34.520]  but I'll also question you this people that are tired and I didn't want to take too long on this
[03:44:34.520 --> 03:44:37.520]  let me just say one thing before you say that and another huge
[03:44:37.520 --> 03:44:38.520]  interrupt the way
[03:44:38.520 --> 03:44:39.520]  before I forget
[03:44:39.520 --> 03:44:41.520]  just smack me in the face and start talking actually
[03:44:41.520 --> 03:44:45.520]  one of the most important elements is for the whole endocrine system
[03:44:45.520 --> 03:44:46.520]  iodine
[03:44:46.520 --> 03:44:50.520]  and I can pretty much guarantee if you have hypothyroidism and you're
[03:44:50.520 --> 03:44:54.520]  and your endocrine system is not functioning up to full capacity
[03:44:54.520 --> 03:44:57.520]  that you're severely iodine deficient so no no
[03:44:57.520 --> 03:45:00.520]  no hard feelings on the interruption over there
[03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:02.520]  I'm joking I don't care
[03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:05.520]  so no exactly and I would also say
[03:45:05.520 --> 03:45:08.520]  people are living a life sometimes
[03:45:08.520 --> 03:45:10.520]  when they think about going to work
[03:45:10.520 --> 03:45:13.520]  and I think there's also an artificial tiredness that happens
[03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:15.520]  because it's mentally fatiguing
[03:45:15.520 --> 03:45:17.520]  it's like think about
[03:45:17.520 --> 03:45:20.520]  gee I have to go to work today on a Monday are you like sluggish and tired
[03:45:20.520 --> 03:45:24.520]  but what if you just won five billion dollars and you're going on at all expenses
[03:45:24.520 --> 03:45:26.520]  paid crews around the world
[03:45:26.520 --> 03:45:28.520]  think about the difference about that how do you feel about that
[03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:30.520]  wow you're actually excited maybe that's some energy
[03:45:30.520 --> 03:45:33.520]  so I'd also question about you know whether or not you're at a good place in your life
[03:45:33.520 --> 03:45:36.520]  and if you like the direction you're heading because a lack of motivation
[03:45:36.520 --> 03:45:41.520]  and a lack of kind of hope in the future also drains people I think too
[03:45:41.520 --> 03:45:45.520]  I had a question one time they asked somebody I heard a doctor ask somebody
[03:45:45.520 --> 03:45:47.520]  that had low energy joking around he said
[03:45:47.520 --> 03:45:50.520]  if you knew there was a million dollars in gold
[03:45:50.520 --> 03:45:54.520]  buried two or three hundred feet in the earth
[03:45:54.520 --> 03:45:57.520]  how hard would you work to get that
[03:45:57.520 --> 03:46:01.520]  and everybody's like well I would just be digging nonstop for days
[03:46:01.520 --> 03:46:05.520]  I mean think about that how much energy that would take to dig through rock
[03:46:05.520 --> 03:46:08.520]  to get to a million dollars worth of gold that's buried a hundred feet down
[03:46:08.520 --> 03:46:11.520]  I've drawn that parallel before yeah it's interesting yeah they have actually
[03:46:11.520 --> 03:46:14.520]  interesting it is a it is a component I mean
[03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:17.520]  you know happiness has a lot to do with that happiness in your life
[03:46:17.520 --> 03:46:19.520]  how happy are you in your relationships
[03:46:19.520 --> 03:46:22.520]  how happy are you like what I was talking about earlier
[03:46:22.520 --> 03:46:25.520]  can you look in the mirror in the morning
[03:46:25.520 --> 03:46:28.520]  and say I am happy with myself
[03:46:28.520 --> 03:46:30.520]  I'm happy with my body
[03:46:30.520 --> 03:46:32.520]  I'm happy with my life
[03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:34.520]  whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:36.520]  oh my gosh
[03:46:36.520 --> 03:46:38.520]  you're doing something very offensive Dr. Group
[03:46:38.520 --> 03:46:40.520]  you're actually talking about real topics and real solutions
[03:46:40.520 --> 03:46:42.520]  and issues in people's lives and they're very upset
[03:46:42.520 --> 03:46:44.520]  some people are very upset about that
[03:46:44.520 --> 03:46:46.520]  alright you're doing something very bad
[03:46:46.520 --> 03:46:48.520]  you're trying to help them with their bodies
[03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:50.520]  and you're talking about real problems in their life
[03:46:50.520 --> 03:46:52.520]  that's triggering me right now actually
[03:46:52.520 --> 03:46:54.520]  I'm talking about solutions
[03:46:54.520 --> 03:46:56.520]  are you having some problems in your life you need to talk about
[03:46:56.520 --> 03:46:57.520]  that's really upsetting me
[03:46:57.520 --> 03:46:59.520]  because I could be a psychiatrist too
[03:46:59.520 --> 03:47:01.520]  and we could just kind of work through those problems
[03:47:01.520 --> 03:47:03.520]  and give you advice for a small fee
[03:47:03.520 --> 03:47:05.520]  awesome alright Ryan thanks for your call
[03:47:05.520 --> 03:47:07.520]  let's go ahead and talk to
[03:47:07.520 --> 03:47:09.520]  Kara
[03:47:09.520 --> 03:47:11.520]  I think it's supposed to say Carlos in Virginia
[03:47:11.520 --> 03:47:13.520]  you want to talk about inflammation which again
[03:47:13.520 --> 03:47:15.520]  is another root issue so that's why I'm choosing these
[03:47:15.520 --> 03:47:17.520]  Carlos what do you have to say about inflammation
[03:47:17.520 --> 03:47:19.520]  hello sir can you hear me
[03:47:19.520 --> 03:47:21.520]  absolutely
[03:47:21.520 --> 03:47:23.520]  yes I was
[03:47:23.520 --> 03:47:25.520]  wondering about systemic inflammation
[03:47:25.520 --> 03:47:27.520]  and autoimmune
[03:47:27.520 --> 03:47:29.520]  diseases such as psoriasis
[03:47:29.520 --> 03:47:31.520]  what would you recommend
[03:47:31.520 --> 03:47:33.520]  naturally to
[03:47:33.520 --> 03:47:35.520]  combat those type of issues
[03:47:35.520 --> 03:47:37.520]  Carlos let me tell you
[03:47:37.520 --> 03:47:39.520]  that practically every
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:41.520]  single negative
[03:47:41.520 --> 03:47:43.520]  health condition out there
[03:47:43.520 --> 03:47:45.520]  is associated with inflammation
[03:47:45.520 --> 03:47:47.520]  I mean and which could come from the gut
[03:47:47.520 --> 03:47:49.520]  because you could have inflammation
[03:47:49.520 --> 03:47:51.520]  maybe it's like a secondary thing too
[03:47:51.520 --> 03:47:53.520]  you know from the gut
[03:47:53.520 --> 03:47:55.520]  the gut has an issue and then the rest of the body
[03:47:55.520 --> 03:47:57.520]  systemically responds with inflammation
[03:47:57.520 --> 03:47:59.520]  right so whenever you have
[03:47:59.520 --> 03:48:01.520]  inflammation it's a response
[03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:03.520]  it's a sign
[03:48:03.520 --> 03:48:05.520]  that you have a lot of different things going on
[03:48:05.520 --> 03:48:07.520]  and you can associate any disorder
[03:48:07.520 --> 03:48:09.520]  heart disease with inflammation
[03:48:09.520 --> 03:48:11.520]  of the veins and arteries, diabetes
[03:48:11.520 --> 03:48:13.520]  there's inflammation of the pancreas
[03:48:13.520 --> 03:48:15.520]  arthritis inflammation
[03:48:15.520 --> 03:48:17.520]  of the joint tissue it doesn't matter
[03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:19.520]  what condition
[03:48:19.520 --> 03:48:21.520]  you have if you have gut problems
[03:48:21.520 --> 03:48:23.520]  you have cellular inflammation
[03:48:23.520 --> 03:48:25.520]  again what you want
[03:48:25.520 --> 03:48:27.520]  to do is you have to think
[03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:29.520]  what causes that inflammation
[03:48:29.520 --> 03:48:31.520]  what is really causing that autoimmune
[03:48:31.520 --> 03:48:33.520]  autoimmune is just when
[03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:35.520]  your body fights itself
[03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:37.520]  it's one of the worst things your body
[03:48:37.520 --> 03:48:39.520]  turns against itself
[03:48:39.520 --> 03:48:41.520]  your body thinks that your own body
[03:48:41.520 --> 03:48:43.520]  is
[03:48:43.520 --> 03:48:45.520]  attacking it so that's an autoimmune
[03:48:45.520 --> 03:48:47.520]  so that means what causes all that
[03:48:47.520 --> 03:48:49.520]  I can tell you it really shows how
[03:48:49.520 --> 03:48:51.520]  unnatural of a response
[03:48:51.520 --> 03:48:53.520]  in the first place something is going on
[03:48:53.520 --> 03:48:55.520]  right if your body thinks that its own
[03:48:55.520 --> 03:48:57.520]  self is an enemy what is happening
[03:48:57.520 --> 03:48:59.520]  to trick it to that point right
[03:48:59.520 --> 03:49:01.520]  right it all boils down to too many
[03:49:01.520 --> 03:49:03.520]  chemicals and toxins in your body
[03:49:03.520 --> 03:49:05.520]  and not enough coming out of your body
[03:49:05.520 --> 03:49:07.520]  on a daily basis your body is overburdened
[03:49:07.520 --> 03:49:09.520]  just like 90%
[03:49:09.520 --> 03:49:11.520]  of the people's bodies out there
[03:49:11.520 --> 03:49:13.520]  it's hard to avoid all these things
[03:49:13.520 --> 03:49:15.520]  we have to take a proactive approach to clean
[03:49:15.520 --> 03:49:17.520]  to eliminate these chemicals and toxins
[03:49:17.520 --> 03:49:19.520]  from coming into the body
[03:49:19.520 --> 03:49:21.520]  but then also clean them all out
[03:49:21.520 --> 03:49:23.520]  you know
[03:49:23.520 --> 03:49:25.520]  everything is in simplicity
[03:49:25.520 --> 03:49:27.520]  and that's one of the things that I learned
[03:49:27.520 --> 03:49:29.520]  because I was taught
[03:49:29.520 --> 03:49:31.520]  before I was going to do the medical
[03:49:31.520 --> 03:49:33.520]  thing about all the prescription medications
[03:49:33.520 --> 03:49:35.520]  and then I was taught
[03:49:35.520 --> 03:49:37.520]  how to prescribe natural
[03:49:37.520 --> 03:49:39.520]  medicine to everybody
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:41.520]  but I realized that even with the natural
[03:49:41.520 --> 03:49:43.520]  stuff unless you take two steps back
[03:49:43.520 --> 03:49:45.520]  before you take two steps forward
[03:49:45.520 --> 03:49:47.520]  you still have a toxic body
[03:49:47.520 --> 03:49:49.520]  what you really need to do is
[03:49:49.520 --> 03:49:51.520]  in order to truly activate your self healing
[03:49:51.520 --> 03:49:53.520]  mechanism and to reduce that
[03:49:53.520 --> 03:49:55.520]  inflammation sure there's some things
[03:49:55.520 --> 03:49:57.520]  you can take for inflammation
[03:49:57.520 --> 03:49:59.520]  oregano oil works really good
[03:49:59.520 --> 03:50:01.520]  silver works really good
[03:50:01.520 --> 03:50:03.520]  white willow bark, hawthorn
[03:50:03.520 --> 03:50:05.520]  you know there's different types of herbs
[03:50:05.520 --> 03:50:07.520]  that you can use
[03:50:07.520 --> 03:50:09.520]  but why not
[03:50:09.520 --> 03:50:11.520]  just address the root cause of it
[03:50:11.520 --> 03:50:13.520]  and that's going to be changing up your diet
[03:50:13.520 --> 03:50:15.520]  eating organic foods
[03:50:15.520 --> 03:50:17.520]  drinking nothing but pure clean water
[03:50:17.520 --> 03:50:19.520]  for at least three months
[03:50:19.520 --> 03:50:21.520]  I don't know what you're drinking if you're a coffee drinker
[03:50:21.520 --> 03:50:23.520]  anything else
[03:50:23.520 --> 03:50:25.520]  but one of the best ways to eliminate inflammation
[03:50:25.520 --> 03:50:27.520]  in the body is just do nothing but drink
[03:50:27.520 --> 03:50:29.520]  pure clean water and I usually add
[03:50:29.520 --> 03:50:31.520]  organic apple cider vinegar by the way
[03:50:31.520 --> 03:50:33.520]  that also helps work
[03:50:33.520 --> 03:50:35.520]  to reduce the inflammation
[03:50:35.520 --> 03:50:37.520]  but
[03:50:37.520 --> 03:50:39.520]  gut get your gut cleaned and healthy
[03:50:39.520 --> 03:50:41.520]  get your liver cleaned and healthy
[03:50:41.520 --> 03:50:43.520]  and start that process of detoxification
[03:50:43.520 --> 03:50:45.520]  absolutely we'll be back
[03:50:45.520 --> 03:50:47.520]  with some more and some more news
[03:50:47.520 --> 03:50:49.520]  from multiple different sources on some truly
[03:50:49.520 --> 03:50:51.520]  interesting topics
[03:50:51.520 --> 03:50:53.520]  for our back is the Alex Jones show Anthony Gutiarty and Dr. Group
[03:50:53.520 --> 03:50:55.520]  stay with us
[03:50:59.520 --> 03:51:01.520]  my name is Don Wiskin
[03:51:01.520 --> 03:51:03.520]  and at 42 years old I suffered a massive heart attack
[03:51:03.520 --> 03:51:05.520]  and was told I'd be on disability
[03:51:05.520 --> 03:51:07.520]  for the rest of my life
[03:51:07.520 --> 03:51:09.520]  what did I do?
[03:51:09.520 --> 03:51:11.520]  I created Extendivite
[03:51:11.520 --> 03:51:13.520]  a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs
[03:51:13.520 --> 03:51:15.520]  which rebuilt my heart
[03:51:15.520 --> 03:51:17.520]  and gave me back my life
[03:51:17.520 --> 03:51:19.520]  over 17 years now
[03:51:19.520 --> 03:51:21.520]  I have made this formula
[03:51:21.520 --> 03:51:23.520]  available to you
[03:51:23.520 --> 03:51:25.520]  so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did
[03:51:25.520 --> 03:51:27.520]  clean your blocked arteries
[03:51:27.520 --> 03:51:29.520]  and strengthen your heart
[03:51:29.520 --> 03:51:31.520]  and boost your natural immune system
[03:51:31.520 --> 03:51:33.520]  I'm 60 years old now
[03:51:33.520 --> 03:51:35.520]  and I still work every day
[03:51:35.520 --> 03:51:37.520]  to get your Extendivite call
[03:51:37.520 --> 03:51:39.520]  1-877-928-8822
[03:51:39.520 --> 03:51:41.520]  that's 1-877-928-8822
[03:51:41.520 --> 03:51:43.520]  or visit
[03:51:43.520 --> 03:51:45.520]  heartdrop.com
[03:51:45.520 --> 03:51:47.520]  Extendivite is only
[03:51:47.520 --> 03:51:49.520]  $69.95 for a two month supply
[03:51:49.520 --> 03:51:51.520]  of either capsules or liquid
[03:51:51.520 --> 03:51:53.520]  Extend your life
[03:51:53.520 --> 03:51:55.520]  with Extendivite
[03:51:57.520 --> 03:51:59.520]  as if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough
[03:51:59.520 --> 03:52:01.520]  now they're adding ammonia
[03:52:01.520 --> 03:52:03.520]  it's true some municipalities are now adding
[03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:05.520]  ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply
[03:52:05.520 --> 03:52:07.520]  it's a disinfectant called chloramine
[03:52:07.520 --> 03:52:09.520]  but with a trusted big
[03:52:09.520 --> 03:52:11.520]  Berkey water filter you can keep chloramine
[03:52:11.520 --> 03:52:13.520]  out of your water
[03:52:13.520 --> 03:52:15.520]  new NSF EPA certified lab test
[03:52:15.520 --> 03:52:17.520]  show EPA Berkey water filters

[03:54:17.520 --> 03:54:19.520]  we took calls we talked about
[03:54:19.520 --> 03:54:21.520]  some really important news that you can use
[03:54:21.520 --> 03:54:23.520]  in your life from gut health
[03:54:23.520 --> 03:54:25.520]  to you name it
[03:54:25.520 --> 03:54:27.520]  and I'm actually upset that we didn't mention
[03:54:27.520 --> 03:54:29.520]  this earlier because that was one of the reasons
[03:54:29.520 --> 03:54:31.520]  Dr. Groups here today is that DNA
[03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:33.520]  force is now back in stock
[03:54:33.520 --> 03:54:35.520]  in infowarslife.com
[03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:37.520]  it's been out for months and this is a product
[03:54:37.520 --> 03:54:39.520]  that it's one of those products where
[03:54:39.520 --> 03:54:41.520]  you say stuff about it and it sounds made up
[03:54:41.520 --> 03:54:43.520]  so when I say that the pqq
[03:54:43.520 --> 03:54:45.520]  that's found in stardust
[03:54:45.520 --> 03:54:47.520]  the bio pqq is backed by
[03:54:47.520 --> 03:54:49.520]  135 clinical studies
[03:54:49.520 --> 03:54:51.520]  $80,000 or so
[03:54:51.520 --> 03:54:53.520]  per unit that we buy it in
[03:54:53.520 --> 03:54:55.520]  that sounds crazy but it's actually true
[03:54:55.520 --> 03:54:57.520]  and DNA force which is
[03:54:57.520 --> 03:54:59.520]  I think one of the coolest names of the infowarslife products
[03:54:59.520 --> 03:55:01.520]  is
[03:55:01.520 --> 03:55:03.520]  really one of those products
[03:55:03.520 --> 03:55:05.520]  that in the development phase
[03:55:05.520 --> 03:55:07.520]  Dr. Group had to go back and forth with all these different people
[03:55:07.520 --> 03:55:09.520]  to get all the contracts and everything
[03:55:09.520 --> 03:55:11.520]  just to put it in there the bio pqq
[03:55:11.520 --> 03:55:13.520]  which is just one ingredient
[03:55:13.520 --> 03:55:15.520]  he has some information on it too he's going to share
[03:55:15.520 --> 03:55:17.520]  175 clinical studies more
[03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:19.520]  about the excellent activity
[03:55:19.520 --> 03:55:21.520]  then vitamin C
[03:55:21.520 --> 03:55:23.520]  just one of the ingredients
[03:55:23.520 --> 03:55:25.520]  the coq10 you name it
[03:55:25.520 --> 03:55:27.520]  it's all in DNA force
[03:55:27.520 --> 03:55:29.520]  and he added a new ingredient this run
[03:55:29.520 --> 03:55:31.520]  fulvic acid
[03:55:31.520 --> 03:55:33.520]  with no extra charge
[03:55:33.520 --> 03:55:35.520]  on the bottle themselves so it's the same price for everybody
[03:55:35.520 --> 03:55:37.520]  it's back in stock with a new ingredient
[03:55:37.520 --> 03:55:39.520]  you don't have to pay any more money
[03:55:39.520 --> 03:55:41.520]  honestly it's my favorite product
[03:55:41.520 --> 03:55:43.520]  I was saying earlier it really is
[03:55:43.520 --> 03:55:45.520]  the holy grail I mean obviously
[03:55:45.520 --> 03:55:47.520]  you can reactivate your body's self healing mechanism
[03:55:47.520 --> 03:55:49.520]  you can cleanse your body
[03:55:49.520 --> 03:55:51.520]  but there are certain nutrients
[03:55:51.520 --> 03:55:53.520]  antioxidants and systems
[03:55:53.520 --> 03:55:55.520]  inside the cell that are really hard
[03:55:55.520 --> 03:55:57.520]  to get
[03:55:57.520 --> 03:55:59.520]  in a normal diet
[03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:01.520]  and that's really what we wanted to focus on with DNA force
[03:56:01.520 --> 03:56:03.520]  was just providing the cell
[03:56:03.520 --> 03:56:05.520]  all the nutrients and everything
[03:56:05.520 --> 03:56:07.520]  it needs and with the addition of fulvic acid
[03:56:07.520 --> 03:56:09.520]  I mean this product is amazing
[03:56:09.520 --> 03:56:11.520]  it's
[03:56:11.520 --> 03:56:13.520]  it's something I would recommend people take on a regular
[03:56:13.520 --> 03:56:15.520]  basis every day every other day
[03:56:15.520 --> 03:56:17.520]  the results
[03:56:17.520 --> 03:56:19.520]  the reviews
[03:56:19.520 --> 03:56:21.520]  I read the reviews
[03:56:21.520 --> 03:56:23.520]  literally changed people's life
[03:56:23.520 --> 03:56:25.520]  all the info wars life
[03:56:25.520 --> 03:56:27.520]  products
[03:56:27.520 --> 03:56:29.520]  how gratifying is it
[03:56:29.520 --> 03:56:31.520]  to be able to go home every single day
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:33.520]  for me, for you
[03:56:33.520 --> 03:56:35.520]  and know that you've made a difference
[03:56:35.520 --> 03:56:37.520]  in somebody's life
[03:56:37.520 --> 03:56:39.520]  everybody's job was like that
[03:56:39.520 --> 03:56:41.520]  this is actually real
[03:56:41.520 --> 03:56:43.520]  we do actually care about these things
[03:56:43.520 --> 03:56:45.520]  we do actually spend hours and hours
[03:56:45.520 --> 03:56:47.520]  talking about this, development on the phone
[03:56:47.520 --> 03:56:49.520]  meeting, going and flying places
[03:56:49.520 --> 03:56:51.520]  this is the real deal, this isn't a joke
[03:56:51.520 --> 03:56:53.520]  it's why we sit up here, we're super proud of these products
[03:56:53.520 --> 03:56:55.520]  super super proud, Dr. Group
[03:56:55.520 --> 03:56:57.520]  is absurdly obsessed with quality
[03:56:57.520 --> 03:56:59.520]  and admittedly it even annoys me sometimes
[03:56:59.520 --> 03:57:01.520]  how obsessed he is
[03:57:01.520 --> 03:57:03.520]  it's just level 10
[03:57:03.520 --> 03:57:05.520]  there's nothing better period
[03:57:05.520 --> 03:57:07.520]  I'd also mention
[03:57:07.520 --> 03:57:09.520]  we're not sitting here making recommendations
[03:57:09.520 --> 03:57:11.520]  to the callers for their health
[03:57:11.520 --> 03:57:13.520]  please, please do not
[03:57:13.520 --> 03:57:15.520]  just listen to us, this is just
[03:57:15.520 --> 03:57:17.520]  information
[03:57:17.520 --> 03:57:19.520]  go and speak to a qualified healthcare professional
[03:57:19.520 --> 03:57:21.520]  go and speak to a medical doctor
[03:57:21.520 --> 03:57:23.520]  or integrated medical doctor, whatever you want to see
[03:57:23.520 --> 03:57:25.520]  just speak to someone for your health
[03:57:25.520 --> 03:57:27.520]  that actually can talk to you
[03:57:27.520 --> 03:57:29.520]  we have what, 10 second phone call with you
[03:57:29.520 --> 03:57:31.520]  and I'm not a qualified healthcare professional
[03:57:31.520 --> 03:57:33.520]  speak to somebody that is a
[03:57:33.520 --> 03:57:35.520]  qualified healthcare professional
[03:57:35.520 --> 03:57:37.520]  and always get their advice before starting anything
[03:57:37.520 --> 03:57:39.520]  or really doing anything that is important
[03:57:39.520 --> 03:57:41.520]  for your health, so I just wanted to remind you guys
[03:57:41.520 --> 03:57:43.520]  of that, we're not trying to tell you what to do
[03:57:43.520 --> 03:57:45.520]  we're not giving medical advice
[03:57:45.520 --> 03:57:47.520]  we're not giving medical advice 100%
[03:57:47.520 --> 03:57:49.520]  but we do have the ability to sit up here
[03:57:49.520 --> 03:57:51.520]  and talk about some things we know and read some studies
[03:57:51.520 --> 03:57:53.520]  and share some information
[03:57:53.520 --> 03:57:55.520]  that we've learned probably the hard way
[03:57:55.520 --> 03:57:57.520]  definitely the hard way, so Dr. Group
[03:57:57.520 --> 03:57:59.520]  thank you so much for all that you do

[03:58:05.520 --> 03:58:07.520]  live stream, so this is nothing to us
[03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:09.520]  anyway, thanks for having me on
