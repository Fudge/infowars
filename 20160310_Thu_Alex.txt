[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:33.200]  ladies and gentlemen I'm your host Alex Jones it is Thursday March 10th 2016
[00:33.200 --> 00:39.440]  we're gonna be live here for the next four hours ladies and gentlemen there is
[00:39.440 --> 00:45.640]  so much happening obviously but what I want to dive into first is the fact that
[00:45.640 --> 00:52.840]  Ted Cruz in the last few days has had multiple members of the Bush family and
[00:52.840 --> 00:59.000]  more importantly the Bush apparatus joined his national finance team to get
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.760]  him money now it was known that he came out of the Bush power structure George
[01:05.760 --> 01:12.560]  W. Bush and that his wife Et Goldman Sachs was a key operator helping get the
[01:12.560 --> 01:16.760]  TPP set up years before it was even publicly known that it was being
[01:16.760 --> 01:22.360]  developed the fact that Goldman Sachs helped finance some of his early
[01:22.360 --> 01:26.080]  campaigning in Texas now becomes very very clear that the Bushes know that
[01:26.080 --> 01:32.840]  their name is mud and so they have been deploying slick political operatives like
[01:32.840 --> 01:41.040]  Ted Cruz into the system to place this sleeper cell or sleeper operator in
[01:41.040 --> 01:46.840]  government and in the U.S. Senate so that he can then activate at a later date
[01:46.840 --> 01:52.080]  and carry out their operations which we now see trying to knock out the dark
[01:52.080 --> 01:56.560]  horse populist candidate Donald Trump now I personally want to believe in Ted
[01:56.560 --> 01:59.880]  Cruz he's said a lot of great things he's done a lot of great things in the
[01:59.880 --> 02:04.040]  Senate defending the Second Amendment you name it but I've been weighing the
[02:04.040 --> 02:08.400]  evidence and before I was you know leaning towards him and give him the
[02:08.400 --> 02:12.320]  benefit of the doubt a lot of folks got mad at me about that saying hey he's got
[02:12.320 --> 02:16.560]  a CFR background with his wife Goldman Sachs you know working inside the Bush
[02:16.560 --> 02:20.720]  operation and I said well maybe he's broken away from them let's see what
[02:20.720 --> 02:27.120]  happens we've even seen the new land commissioner here in Texas who is a
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.720]  Bush grandson of Herbert Walker saying I don't like the CFR I don't like the
[02:31.720 --> 02:36.880]  Tribal Tribal Commission I don't like the New World Order I want to be against
[02:36.880 --> 02:41.000]  that and they're getting elected on the back of that so we see them coming out
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.080]  with rhetoric that we know isn't true when it's the case of George P. Bush or
[02:47.080 --> 02:50.960]  whatever his name is this is how they are operating and they think we're
[02:50.960 --> 02:57.280]  stupid and now the weight is going towards Cruz being a clear Manchurian
[02:57.280 --> 03:01.960]  candidate of the Bush crime family I don't think we can convict him of it but
[03:01.960 --> 03:06.360]  there's enough question there that I'm done with Ted Cruz at this time if he
[03:06.360 --> 03:10.360]  stays in the Senate and does good things down the road I will support him but
[03:10.360 --> 03:14.820]  he's done a lot of things that are are really really bad and he's done some
[03:14.820 --> 03:19.080]  flip-flopping and some support of some of these globalist operations he was
[03:19.080 --> 03:23.400]  early on part of the plan to bring an amnesty this is very very serious we're
[03:23.400 --> 03:28.040]  gonna be discussing this today with callers and more you can tweet your
[03:28.040 --> 03:32.720]  your points we'll read some on on air to real Alex Jones today let me know what
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.000]  you think now separately from that we've got Trump continuing to dominate
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.080]  we've got the media attacks heating up they're still asking him why won't you
[03:41.080 --> 03:46.520]  disavow the Ku Klux Klan whether it's 18 times or 25 times or 39 times or 47
[03:46.520 --> 03:51.400]  times you know that it's up to they just keep saying why won't you deny it it's
[03:51.400 --> 03:55.480]  going to attempt to again target those that aren't paying attention out there
[03:55.480 --> 03:58.560]  we're gonna be breaking that down but the really big news is the fact that they
[03:58.560 --> 04:04.320]  can't defeat Liberty they can't defeat free speech because it's so popular the
[04:04.320 --> 04:08.840]  truth is coming out they can't defeat sunshine they run like roaches from it
[04:08.840 --> 04:13.280]  so they're openly trying to adopt the European globalist models of censorship
[04:13.280 --> 04:17.920]  they are already arresting people in areas of Europe that deny man-made
[04:17.920 --> 04:21.400]  global warming or climate change period they're already trying to go after
[04:21.400 --> 04:27.600]  professors doctorates and their their tenure now that's starting here and we
[04:27.600 --> 04:32.320]  have chilling testimony coming up after the break from a congressional committee
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.960]  with Loretta Lynch who I just said the word Lynch sorry they actually want to
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.440]  ban that word I'm not getting actually they are banning it at some campuses and
[04:40.440 --> 04:45.520]  the word master because that's hurtful this cult now is talking about the the
[04:45.520 --> 04:54.320]  FBI is looking into prosecuting people that deny that any climate change isn't
[04:54.320 --> 04:58.040]  man-made we're gonna go to break we'll be right back I'm Alex Jones stay with us
[04:58.040 --> 05:03.920]  military drone technology is back in the headlines recently SEO a subdivision of
[05:03.920 --> 05:07.960]  the US military with ties to DARPA released a video of micro drones being
[05:07.960 --> 05:12.400]  launched from an F-16 fighter at 430 miles per hour the Washington Post
[05:12.400 --> 05:17.400]  article titled veil of secrecy lifted on Pentagon office planning avatar fighter
[05:17.400 --> 05:21.600]  and drone swarms the announcement also represents another step toward total
[05:21.600 --> 05:25.520]  autonomous military robotics a technology that top experts such as Elon
[05:25.520 --> 05:29.480]  Musk and Max Tegmark have been warning scientists to think twice about SEO
[05:29.480 --> 05:32.760]  also said in the same announcement they have successfully developed and tested
[05:32.760 --> 05:37.160]  avatar flight technology our new project not previously reported is called
[05:37.160 --> 05:40.960]  avatar and calls for the Pentagon to pair high-tech fifth-generation fighter
[05:40.960 --> 05:44.280]  jets with unmanned versions of older jets which would be flown without a
[05:44.280 --> 05:48.360]  pilot for the first time imagine this technology in the hands of the same
[05:48.360 --> 05:51.480]  government that was also forced to admit this week that it had been using
[05:51.480 --> 05:55.320]  domestic drones for domestic surveillance operations Rob Dew reporting for

[09:17.920 --> 09:22.760]  have ever covered period not just when it comes to free speech but to every
[09:22.760 --> 09:28.040]  other basic fundamental freedom they are using models in Europe that they're
[09:28.040 --> 09:32.680]  testing to ban free speech to bring in civil emergencies and to even ban the
[09:32.680 --> 09:38.280]  name mother and father to ban crosses to ban churches but but the Muslims can do
[09:38.280 --> 09:41.240]  whatever they want and the government actually takes over churches you pull up
[09:41.240 --> 09:44.600]  the articles and turns them into mosque so they can mutilate their daughters put
[09:44.600 --> 09:48.360]  hoods on their heads be hives suits everything but the Lord mother and
[09:48.360 --> 09:53.240]  father's not allowed now you've heard Al Gore you've heard others say they need a
[09:53.240 --> 09:58.280]  leftist spring in America and Europe to ban our free speech to come at us with
[09:58.280 --> 10:03.080]  the torches now the Attorney General in testimony I'm about to play so chilling
[10:03.080 --> 10:09.080]  has come out and said they have the FBI looking and investigating free speech in
[10:09.080 --> 10:15.080]  America and they're looking at arresting people that deny anthropogenic
[10:15.080 --> 10:22.680]  climate change the UN is calling for Lord Moncton's arrest now they've been
[10:22.680 --> 10:26.760]  caught in their internal emails worldwide in climate gay admitting they're
[10:26.760 --> 10:31.800]  fixing the numbers to hide the decline in temperature this is all about global
[10:31.800 --> 10:36.200]  government and worldwide taxation but regardless of what you think about the
[10:36.200 --> 10:47.080]  scheme to have a congressperson from road island openly coming out and asking
[10:47.080 --> 10:52.520]  her hey can't we ban free speech can't we do this and she says yes we have the
[10:52.520 --> 10:57.720]  FBI looking at it senator a Sheldon White House Democrat of road island in
[10:57.720 --> 11:02.360]  the congress in the Senate hearing having this meeting now think about that
[11:02.360 --> 11:05.080]  we're gonna play the club in a moment and they do it so calmly they go well you
[11:05.080 --> 11:10.200]  know the tobacco companies got caught lying about cigarettes giving you
[11:10.200 --> 11:16.040]  cancer can't we prosecute people and in New York state they're already trying to
[11:16.040 --> 11:21.400]  prosecute the Attorney General there scientific papers and professors that
[11:21.400 --> 11:25.240]  have written papers about the Sun being the main driver of climate no kidding
[11:25.240 --> 11:28.280]  when you're tipped away from the Sun you you have winter when you're tipped
[11:28.280 --> 11:32.840]  towards it you have summer duh and she says yes we're looking at
[11:32.840 --> 11:37.640]  prosecuting them they mean business and that's why they're bullying everyone's
[11:37.640 --> 11:42.040]  free speech to try to make everybody basically submit to all of this so let's
[11:42.040 --> 11:46.440]  go ahead and go to this clip
[11:46.440 --> 11:51.560]  Madam Attorney General the similarities between the mischief of the tobacco
[11:51.560 --> 11:57.400]  industry pretending that the science of tobacco's dangers was unsettled
[11:57.400 --> 12:01.720]  and the fossil fuel industry pretending that the science of carbon emissions
[12:01.720 --> 12:07.000]  dangers is unsettled has been remarked on widely
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.720]  particularly by those who study the climate denial apparatus that the
[12:11.720 --> 12:16.680]  fossil fuel industry has erected under president clinton the department of
[12:16.680 --> 12:19.720]  justice brought and won a civil
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.360]  riko action against the tobacco industry for its fraud
[12:24.360 --> 12:27.160]  under president obama the department of justice
[12:27.160 --> 12:32.120]  has done nothing so far about the climate denial scheme
[12:32.120 --> 12:36.280]  a request for action by the department of justice
[12:36.280 --> 12:42.760]  has been referred by you to the fbi my question to you is other than civil
[12:42.760 --> 12:46.760]  forfeitures and matters attendant to a criminal case
[12:46.760 --> 12:50.520]  are there other circumstances in which a civil matter
[12:50.520 --> 12:53.400]  under the authority of the department of justice
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.400]  has been referred to the fbi senator thank you for the
[12:57.400 --> 13:00.840]  that raising that issue and thank you for your work in this area i know your
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.280]  commitment is deep this matter has been discussed we have
[13:04.280 --> 13:07.880]  received information about it and have referred it to the fbi to
[13:07.880 --> 13:11.160]  consider whether or not it meets the criteria for what we could
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.080]  take action on i'm not aware of a civil referral at this time i will look into
[13:15.080 --> 13:18.520]  that and and get back to you i'm but i'm not aware of a civil referral
[13:18.520 --> 13:22.200]  outside of the one that that you just raised are there any civil cases with
[13:22.200 --> 13:27.560]  the united states as plaintiff within doj civil division in which the fbi
[13:27.560 --> 13:31.400]  is preparing the case for the civil division
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.560]  are you regarding climate change regarding any matter
[13:35.560 --> 13:39.160]  i'm not i couldn't give you that information right now as in terms of
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.640]  whether or not we can take that as a question for the record
[13:41.640 --> 13:46.280]  thank you ladies and gentlemen that's what they're actually
[13:46.280 --> 13:51.000]  openly saying now they admit they want to take our guns they admit that
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.960]  they think the family is bad and that manhood is bad
[13:53.960 --> 13:57.880]  they are bringing in driverless cars to track and trace and tax us
[13:57.880 --> 14:03.480]  they are trying to restrict speech everywhere and bully our speech
[14:03.480 --> 14:06.360]  i've told you the stories and and the stories have been in the press with
[14:06.360 --> 14:09.880]  other people where i'm just out in the public and
[14:09.880 --> 14:12.680]  people come over and tell me i need to check my white privilege
[14:12.680 --> 14:18.440]  it's mainly white people doing it this is a open form of political
[14:18.440 --> 14:22.280]  oppression this is what we saw happen in the old
[14:22.280 --> 14:27.240]  soviet union but it's beyond that not even the soviets tried to ban the family
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.720]  and tear down manhood this is beyond that they want us domesticated
[14:31.720 --> 14:36.440]  they want us dumb they want us weak and coming up through the show today we're
[14:36.440 --> 14:39.800]  going to be focusing in on political correctness and just looking at how
[14:39.800 --> 14:42.920]  many forms of free speech are being restricted
[14:42.920 --> 14:46.760]  i remember seeing a texas case just a few years ago where an eight-year-old girl
[14:46.760 --> 14:52.040]  on study hall had a bible in her bag and one of the teachers saw it and took it
[14:52.040 --> 14:55.160]  and threw it away and said this can't be in the school
[14:55.160 --> 14:59.000]  well you have a right to your bible you have a right to speak about how you
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.200]  love god at the lunch table or anywhere else you have a right to talk about dirt
[15:02.200 --> 15:05.720]  bikes or or or oil painting or hunting
[15:05.720 --> 15:09.080]  and shooting or whatever you can talk about you like to go to the opera or
[15:09.080 --> 15:12.120]  you like ballet or you like rock and roll
[15:12.120 --> 15:17.000]  you could talk about that you like buda or or or or
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.760]  anything you want as long as it's not a call to action of violence
[15:20.760 --> 15:23.560]  you can see the stories all over the place where they go you can't hand out
[15:23.560 --> 15:27.240]  christmas cards see first it's the school can't have christmas but now
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.480]  you don't have free speech they hand out christmas cards totally unconstitutional
[15:31.480 --> 15:36.120]  you can't say a school prayer you can't thank god when you become the valovictorian
[15:36.120 --> 15:41.240]  or the salutatorian and they bully and they push and they drive and they
[15:41.240 --> 15:44.760]  just won't stop it in europe they say the muslims don't like
[15:44.760 --> 15:48.600]  trickered uh you know uh uh you know halloween either or
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.160]  uh at the universities they don't like costume parties so we have to ban
[15:53.160 --> 15:57.800]  those and the professors that say no we need free speech are fired
[15:57.800 --> 16:01.960]  to the point that major comedians won't even go out who are liberal
[16:01.960 --> 16:05.720]  two colleges we all know about this there's thousands of examples
[16:05.720 --> 16:10.280]  literally that we could discuss and they're doing this because the liars
[16:10.280 --> 16:13.400]  these corrupt people cannot deal with the fact that we
[16:13.400 --> 16:17.480]  have the truth on our side and so now
[16:17.480 --> 16:20.840]  they want to start with oh banning being racist
[16:20.840 --> 16:24.440]  and then ban words that are offensive and then ban
[16:24.440 --> 16:28.680]  oh denying man-made climate change it never ends
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.360]  it is a pandora's box it's open we have to recognize
[16:32.360 --> 16:35.400]  whether you see yourself as liberal libertarian conservative
[16:35.400 --> 16:39.560]  christian agnostic it doesn't matter we should all come together around basic
[16:39.560 --> 16:43.000]  free speech and realize that serious salutarianism
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.320]  has raised its ugly dirty head now the other big news
[16:47.320 --> 16:49.960]  and i covered this earlier we're gonna get to it more later
[16:49.960 --> 16:53.160]  is neil bush who's the smartest of the family
[16:53.160 --> 16:57.160]  is is is the cunning scam artist with the snl's and
[16:57.160 --> 17:00.840]  all the rest of it billions looted you know the real
[17:00.840 --> 17:04.760]  criminal energy of the family in my view he is now behind
[17:04.760 --> 17:10.280]  the finance committee for uh mr cruce and you add that to the whole history
[17:10.280 --> 17:13.560]  of him coming out of uh george w bush's operation
[17:13.560 --> 17:16.520]  and all these globalist trade deals and his wife being goldman sacks
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.240]  and cfr now this tips the scale to where i do not trust
[17:21.240 --> 17:25.320]  ted cruz i appreciate what he's been like in the senate for four years i hope
[17:25.320 --> 17:28.360]  that continues he may really rehabilitate himself but this
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.520]  move and the dirty tricks and the way he's going
[17:32.520 --> 17:36.680]  over donald trump and having glenn beck on his side really pushes it over the
[17:36.680 --> 17:38.600]  edge now let's shift yours to the real enemy
[17:38.600 --> 17:42.520]  hillary clinton this is up on info wars dot com
[17:42.520 --> 17:46.840]  and it's it's all over the news uh missing clinton email
[17:46.840 --> 17:51.880]  claims saudi's finance ben gazi attacks well saudi arabia ran the proxy armies
[17:51.880 --> 17:56.120]  in ben gazi with nato in the west to topple qaddafi that's the fact
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.200]  that that al qaeda group that attacked the embassy or the substation
[18:00.200 --> 18:03.640]  the safehouse with with the three warehouses of weapons the missiles and
[18:03.640 --> 18:07.560]  and uh other high impact weapons
[18:07.560 --> 18:11.480]  they were on record the security force it's all on record
[18:11.480 --> 18:14.600]  that the state department had hired for this general city
[18:14.600 --> 18:18.200]  then they had everybody pull out because the ambassador wasn't going along with
[18:18.200 --> 18:21.560]  the turkish ambassador that showed up that day and one of the three warehouses
[18:21.560 --> 18:25.320]  of high impact weapons to give to what would become ices
[18:25.320 --> 18:28.600]  now you see saudi arabia admitting they want to give missiles to ices and oh
[18:28.600 --> 18:32.760]  magically they already have them so turkey got upset
[18:32.760 --> 18:36.040]  criminal elements of our government got upset and so the security was pulled
[18:36.040 --> 18:39.560]  and you know the rest of the story he was wiped out and they've had the heroes
[18:39.560 --> 18:43.320]  that survived on fox news saying no we were told to stand down
[18:43.320 --> 18:46.440]  we heard the message it came from the head of the state department
[18:46.440 --> 18:49.800]  as i said who gave us order it's from the very top
[18:49.800 --> 18:54.120]  eight people on their sat phones were like no no no this is over 13 hours
[18:54.120 --> 18:58.280]  eight hours of the siege so everybody else got word to get out evacuate you
[18:58.280 --> 19:01.400]  just better but oh the key person the city and then

[19:13.560 --> 19:16.280]  thousands heard about it that's why it's such a big deal

[24:13.320 --> 24:20.200]  oh no we are live on this march 10 2016 edition of the alex
[24:20.200 --> 24:25.960]  joneshow alex will be live um in about an hour's time with former trump advisor
[24:25.960 --> 24:29.160]  roger stone so be sure to stay tuned for that
[24:29.160 --> 24:33.080]  ton of news coming up in the meantime we've also got info wars reporter
[24:33.080 --> 24:37.080]  richard reeves talking about the collapse of the rubio campaign
[24:37.080 --> 24:41.560]  and in the final hour we've got ed martin president of the eagle forum
[24:41.560 --> 24:45.240]  he's going to talk about how the gop establishment plans to steal this
[24:45.240 --> 24:49.320]  nomination from trump we're going to get into the latest on that
[24:49.320 --> 24:53.320]  as i said ton of news coming up we're going to get into detail after the
[24:53.320 --> 24:57.400]  break but just to summarize glenbeck has basically had another
[24:57.400 --> 25:01.240]  huge meltdown he's lashing out at matt drudge
[25:01.240 --> 25:06.760]  of all people matt drudge who had a huge umbrella he allows a diversity of
[25:06.760 --> 25:11.160]  opinions on his website he basically promotes everyone
[25:11.160 --> 25:14.920]  and yet now glenbeck has come out on his radio show yesterday
[25:14.920 --> 25:19.720]  lashed out at matt drudge because he hangs around with alex jones
[25:19.720 --> 25:22.760]  those are his words and we're going to get into
[25:22.760 --> 25:28.120]  where that originates from why beck is acting increasingly vindictive and
[25:28.120 --> 25:32.040]  bitter about this whole trump nomination process
[25:32.040 --> 25:35.480]  so we're going to get into detail on that we're also going to get into
[25:35.480 --> 25:39.160]  hillary clinton being asked last night at the debate
[25:39.160 --> 25:43.400]  about if she will be indicted or what she will do if she's indicted
[25:43.400 --> 25:47.720]  over her email scandal again as alex just previously mentioned
[25:47.720 --> 25:52.600]  this missing emails come out about how the saudis financed the banghazi attacks
[25:52.600 --> 25:56.040]  this has received very little attention despite the fact that it's been
[25:56.040 --> 25:59.560]  floating around for a while now released by the hacker
[25:59.560 --> 26:02.840]  gucifer so we're going to get into that as well
[26:02.840 --> 26:06.760]  and i've talked about twitter censorship over and over again social media
[26:06.760 --> 26:11.400]  censorship on this show and still most people don't get how
[26:11.400 --> 26:14.760]  important it is so i'm going to talk about it again
[26:14.760 --> 26:18.520]  because we've got the hill now reporting that twitter is
[26:18.520 --> 26:22.440]  openly and this has proven now censoring
[26:22.440 --> 26:25.560]  hashtags that are negative towards hillary clinton
[26:25.560 --> 26:29.880]  and replacing them with positive hashtags we've also got a story about
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.760]  how twitter is banning anonymous accounts because they quote
[26:34.760 --> 26:40.280]  harass isis supporters they're actually banning people on twitter
[26:40.280 --> 26:44.760]  because they criticize isis extremists we're going to play a video on that and
[26:44.760 --> 26:49.160]  explain how this ties into the larger environment of
[26:49.160 --> 26:53.240]  twitter trying to reshape the 2016 election
[26:53.240 --> 26:57.240]  by drowning out conservative voices and now their
[26:57.240 --> 27:01.320]  censorship purge has become so widespread and so dominant
[27:01.320 --> 27:05.880]  that people who go on twitter and criticize isis supporters who quote
[27:05.880 --> 27:08.760]  harass them because now that's the new definition of
[27:08.760 --> 27:13.080]  harassment is criticizing someone they instituted this Orwellian
[27:13.080 --> 27:16.120]  trust and safety council back a couple of months ago
[27:16.120 --> 27:19.800]  headed up by top feminists who think that
[27:19.800 --> 27:23.720]  disagreeing with feminists is harassment so now
[27:23.720 --> 27:28.600]  disagreeing with jihadists is harassment and twitter's shutting down all these
[27:28.600 --> 27:32.200]  anonymous accounts as part of that process yes they are
[27:32.200 --> 27:35.960]  shutting down isis accounts but they're also shutting down people
[27:35.960 --> 27:42.280]  who criticize isis meanwhile we've got yet another celebrity
[27:42.280 --> 27:46.200]  who joked about donald trump's assassination
[27:46.200 --> 27:49.560]  again trump is apparently the only presidential candidate
[27:49.560 --> 27:54.360]  about whom it's okay it's perfectly fine to make jokes about his assassination
[27:54.360 --> 27:59.480]  despite the fact that he's right in the center of the crosshairs
[27:59.480 --> 28:02.840]  he had secret service protection as of last year
[28:02.840 --> 28:07.160]  he wears a bulletproof vest at all times and you will
[28:07.160 --> 28:11.880]  know why given the amount the deluge of death threats he receives on twitter alone
[28:11.880 --> 28:16.120]  on a daily basis you go to twitter on any day
[28:16.120 --> 28:19.880]  you type in in quotation marks assassinate trump
[28:19.880 --> 28:24.680]  you will see a deluge and yes most of this content is just vulgar most of
[28:24.680 --> 28:28.280]  its crap most of its people making jokes
[28:28.280 --> 28:31.960]  but some of these people are serious in fact there was an agitation who is
[28:31.960 --> 28:35.720]  about to be deported basically he agreed to be deported
[28:35.720 --> 28:39.480]  because he made a direct death threat against donald trump
[28:39.480 --> 28:44.520]  so now we have yet another celebrity coming out and doing the same thing
[28:44.520 --> 28:48.760]  facebook twitter takes no action whatsoever against
[28:48.760 --> 28:52.920]  these people if they do it takes them six months to do so
[28:52.920 --> 28:56.120]  you remember i covered the article recently where i pointed out
[28:56.120 --> 29:00.600]  there was a kill donald trump account on twitter it remained online for six
[29:00.600 --> 29:04.120]  months it took me writing an article about it
[29:04.120 --> 29:07.320]  it was gone within minutes of the article being published
[29:07.320 --> 29:11.720]  so again we have this amazing double standard with social media
[29:11.720 --> 29:16.440]  where for example now on facebook people are being banned for a period of
[29:16.440 --> 29:20.600]  seven days from facebook for posting anything with the word
[29:20.600 --> 29:24.600]  faggot in it even if it's a critique of somebody else
[29:24.600 --> 29:28.680]  using the word faggot even if it's a joke like a meme
[29:28.680 --> 29:33.880]  people are being banned on facebook this purge is really accelerating
[29:33.880 --> 29:37.560]  after zuckerberg met with merkel back a few months ago
[29:37.560 --> 29:40.360]  to make that vow to kick people off social media
[29:40.360 --> 29:43.880]  who are critical of the migrant crisis we're going to tell you why it matters
[29:43.880 --> 29:47.320]  why it threatens free speech coming up on the alex jones show live
[29:47.320 --> 29:51.880]  don't go away we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:51.880 --> 29:56.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:58.680 --> 30:02.440]  glenn beck opened his radio show today going off on what the hell has happened
[30:02.440 --> 30:06.600]  to matt drudge the conservative radio host was spurred on this morning by
[30:06.600 --> 30:10.920]  drudge photoshopping rubio as a midget after he didn't win a single state last
[30:10.920 --> 30:14.360]  night beck said ever since judge started hanging out with alex jones
[30:14.360 --> 30:18.120]  he's gone to this weird conspiratorial place where he can't even trust any

[30:37.240 --> 30:40.680]  donors are pressuring marco rubio to drop out of the race immediately when
[30:40.680 --> 30:44.120]  cnn aired a similar report two days ago the drama was high as rubio's
[30:44.120 --> 30:48.040]  communications manager storm cnn to set the record straight that his candidate
[30:48.040 --> 30:52.120]  was not even entertaining the notion and three hours ago fox news aired a very
[30:52.120 --> 30:55.240]  similar report and earlier today cbs did the same

[33:13.320 --> 33:29.160]  it's alex jones we are back on the alex jones show live this march 10th edition
[33:29.160 --> 33:33.800]  as i said alex will be coming up with roger stone former trump advisor
[33:33.800 --> 33:38.360]  we've also got ed martin coming up he of course has worked with roger stone
[33:38.360 --> 33:43.720]  exposing how the gop plans to steal this nomination from trump we're going to
[33:43.720 --> 33:47.640]  hit some of this news first media ice is reporting
[33:47.640 --> 33:52.040]  and bearing in mind we've had running battles with glenn beck for the past
[33:52.040 --> 33:56.120]  10 years solid you know we criticized him for his
[33:56.120 --> 34:00.280]  characterization of ron paul supporters as domestic terrorists we're going to get
[34:00.280 --> 34:03.080]  to that in a moment so it's been a back and
[34:03.080 --> 34:07.080]  forth process but over the last several years of course alex has gone to great
[34:07.080 --> 34:11.160]  lengths including writing an open letter to donald trump
[34:11.160 --> 34:15.000]  to glenn beck i'm sorry to try and bridge this gap to try and
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.520]  reach out to beck and say why do you keep attacking us
[34:18.520 --> 34:23.800]  we've since largely ignored glenn beck as his media platform collapses which i'm
[34:23.800 --> 34:26.680]  going to get into the stats on that in a moment
[34:26.680 --> 34:30.520]  but now glenn beck is back once again attacking alex jones
[34:30.520 --> 34:34.840]  and bizarrely lashing out at matt drudge
[34:34.840 --> 34:39.000]  media right reports glenn beck i don't know what the hell has happened to matt
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.680]  drudge glenn beck opened his radio show today
[34:42.680 --> 34:46.440]  going off on quote what the hell has happened to matt drudge
[34:46.440 --> 34:50.520]  the conservative radio host was spurred on this morning by drudge photoshopping
[34:50.520 --> 34:54.920]  rubio as a midget after he didn't win a single state last night
[34:54.920 --> 34:59.640]  so you had this photoshop image which most of you probably saw it yesterday
[34:59.640 --> 35:05.320]  up on the drudge report it's marco rubio shrunk down so that he looks like a
[35:05.320 --> 35:08.360]  dwarf basically if that's the politically correct term
[35:08.360 --> 35:12.200]  and that was the top banner drudge headline for for half of yesterday
[35:12.200 --> 35:16.840]  glenn beck's not happy about that and that he said he said in this article
[35:16.840 --> 35:21.000]  ever since drudge started quote hanging out with alex jones
[35:21.000 --> 35:25.320]  he's gone to this weird conspiratorial place where he can't even quote trust
[35:25.320 --> 35:30.600]  any news coming from him anymore beck's radio program apparently used to use
[35:30.600 --> 35:33.560]  the drudge report all the time but now they don't even bother
[35:33.560 --> 35:36.920]  and beck suspected that the donald trump campaign
[35:36.920 --> 35:42.760]  is behind the drudge rubio photoshop here's another article out of bright
[35:42.760 --> 35:45.720]  bar glenn beck matt drudge and bright bar are
[35:45.720 --> 35:48.840]  nothing but shills for trump but we're not shills for
[35:48.840 --> 35:51.720]  crews even though glenn beck promotes ted
[35:51.720 --> 35:56.840]  cruise on a daily basis of course on his radio show wednesday beck blasted drudge
[35:56.840 --> 36:01.400]  and bright bar news is nothing but shills for gop frontrunner donald trump
[36:01.400 --> 36:05.240]  but beck stated that he and his staff have proven themselves not to be shills
[36:05.240 --> 36:09.880]  for senator ted cruise quote matt drudge and bright bar they'll never
[36:09.880 --> 36:12.600]  say it but they are nothing but shills for trump
[36:12.600 --> 36:16.760]  and he basically went on to say why is matt drudge
[36:16.760 --> 36:21.640]  posting a photoshopped image of rubio why is he hanging out with alex jones
[36:21.640 --> 36:27.560]  and this is on the same day or the day after drudge
[36:27.560 --> 36:33.000]  splashes the blaze right on top of his website gives them all that traffic
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.360]  even after beck had lashed out at drudge basically what's happening here
[36:38.360 --> 36:42.920]  and you can go on websites like quank cast and see this for yourself
[36:42.920 --> 36:46.360]  every single conservative website that has either endorsed
[36:46.360 --> 36:51.960]  trump or given him a fair shake not aligned with the geop establishment
[36:51.960 --> 36:55.320]  any website that has not relentlessly attacked trump
[36:55.320 --> 36:59.080]  has seen its traffic and its popularity go through the roof
[36:59.080 --> 37:02.680]  you can see this with drudge you can see it with bright bar
[37:02.680 --> 37:09.240]  you can see it with info wars but the blaze glenn beck's website
[37:09.240 --> 37:15.880]  went from attracting 29 million unique visitors per month back in november 2014
[37:15.880 --> 37:22.280]  to a year later dropping to just 16.4 million unique visitors
[37:22.280 --> 37:30.440]  glenn beck dot com also plunged from 4.4 million to 1.4 million unique visitors
[37:30.440 --> 37:35.320]  and this is that the daily beast basically glenn beck's media empire
[37:35.320 --> 37:42.360]  is collapsing they just had another ceo quit it's basically a revolving door
[37:42.360 --> 37:46.920]  they've got managers all over the place stepping on each other's toes
[37:46.920 --> 37:50.440]  and their traffic's dropping through the floor
[37:50.440 --> 37:53.560]  because of course beck has come out in support of ted cruise
[37:53.560 --> 37:58.360]  he's railed against donald trump and now basically it's getting personal he's
[37:58.360 --> 38:02.440]  lashing out at matt drudge simply because drudge has been largely
[38:02.440 --> 38:07.000]  sympathetic to trump so it's emblematic of this
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.920]  bizarre media landscape where you've got a huge fissure within the conservative
[38:10.920 --> 38:15.240]  movement where some to their credit i mean they're
[38:15.240 --> 38:17.640]  right in a way they're sticking to their guns and saying that
[38:17.640 --> 38:22.040]  donald trump doesn't have conservative principles we're not going to support him
[38:22.040 --> 38:24.680]  and people like steven crowder have said that
[38:24.680 --> 38:29.080]  benship hero but with beck it seems bizarrely personal
[38:29.080 --> 38:32.520]  and it seems to be linked to the fact that his media empire
[38:32.520 --> 38:37.480]  is basically collapsing right now of course we've pointed out again and again
[38:37.480 --> 38:41.000]  that beck is not a true conservative himself
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.040]  so for him to level that charge at donald trump
[38:44.040 --> 38:47.160]  and donald trump's supposed supporters in the media
[38:47.160 --> 38:53.400]  is the height of hypocrisy this is an article that i wrote back in 2007
[38:53.400 --> 38:58.440]  this is nearly 10 years ago complaints flood cnn this is when he was back on
[38:58.440 --> 39:02.920]  cnn after beck's me as ron paul supporters as
[39:02.920 --> 39:06.440]  terrorist bearing in mind of course that ron paul
[39:06.440 --> 39:11.880]  the ron paul movement and his supporters laid the groundwork for the tea party
[39:11.880 --> 39:15.240]  out of which ted cruz came in the first place
[39:15.240 --> 39:19.960]  out of which many of the trump you know the trump phenomenon much of that came
[39:19.960 --> 39:23.800]  back in 2007 when beck was on cnn of course he was
[39:23.800 --> 39:28.600]  singing a different song he basically smeared ron paul supporters as
[39:28.600 --> 39:32.440]  terrorists even said the army should be used on them
[39:32.440 --> 39:36.600]  because they represented quote a physical threat
[39:36.600 --> 39:39.400]  and you can actually go back to this article
[39:39.400 --> 39:43.480]  and the video on cnn where beck stays all this is still embedded
[39:43.480 --> 39:47.480]  surprise it still works youtube normally deletes a lot of stuff
[39:47.480 --> 39:50.280]  certainly after 10 years it's a surprise that it's still there
[39:50.280 --> 39:55.400]  but in that video you can see beck openly smearing ron paul supporters
[39:55.400 --> 39:59.720]  the very people who laid the groundwork for the tea party
[39:59.720 --> 40:04.200]  for candidates like ted cruz saying that they were domestic terrorists that
[40:04.200 --> 40:07.800]  they represented a threat and should have the army used against them
[40:07.800 --> 40:14.760]  why well because ron paul held a money bomb on november the fifth
[40:14.760 --> 40:21.080]  and that coincides with the attack on the british parliament 400 years
[40:21.080 --> 40:26.760]  previously by guy forks who was the first domestic terrorist
[40:26.760 --> 40:30.760]  so you can go back and watch this bizarre monologue which we played on the radio
[40:30.760 --> 40:33.560]  show several times over the past 10 years
[40:33.560 --> 40:39.160]  where beck basically equates ron paul and his supporters to domestic terrorists
[40:39.160 --> 40:43.320]  because they had a money bomb on november the fifth
[40:43.320 --> 40:47.000]  and the fact that it was called a money bomb meant that it was linked by with
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.440]  guy forks and his terrorist attack on the british parliament
[40:50.440 --> 40:55.320]  400 years beforehand again quite the stretch
[40:55.320 --> 40:59.000]  but glenbeck did an entire eight-minute segment
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.120]  making this equation between ron paul supporters and domestic terrorists
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.520]  he's been a phony from the very beginning so it's quite rich for him to
[41:08.520 --> 41:12.040]  lash out at other people within the conservative movement
[41:12.040 --> 41:19.080]  and call them phonies 2012 here's another article glenbeck compares ron paul
[41:19.080 --> 41:22.520]  to a psalma bin laden this was of course during the
[41:22.520 --> 41:26.440]  previous uh presidential nominee campaign during the
[41:26.440 --> 41:30.440]  debate ron paul expressed his foreign policy mantra which
[41:30.440 --> 41:33.880]  is that the united states should refrain from military
[41:33.880 --> 41:39.000]  adventurism the very same kind of foreign policy now being espoused by
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.400]  donald trump previously by rand paul before he dropped out of the race
[41:43.400 --> 41:46.360]  so ron paul said during the debate that basically
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.600]  we can't be going we can't have another iraq we can't have another libya
[41:50.600 --> 41:54.600]  glenbeck came out afterwards and equated him to a psalma bin laden
[41:54.600 --> 41:58.840]  for saying those words that was in 2012
[41:58.840 --> 42:02.520]  then we have this from september last year beck
[42:02.520 --> 42:06.840]  any tea partyers who hate obama and like trump
[42:06.840 --> 42:11.560]  might just be racists so again he equated tea party members who had
[42:11.560 --> 42:16.840]  thrown their support behind trump with racists and said basically they
[42:16.840 --> 42:20.200]  they're only voting for trump because they hate president obama
[42:20.200 --> 42:23.960]  if you hate president obama and you support trump
[42:23.960 --> 42:29.480]  you're a racist that was the extent of the evidence for making that claim
[42:29.480 --> 42:33.720]  so again you go to quankas you look at the conservative websites that have
[42:33.720 --> 42:38.440]  enjoyed traffic spikes over the past year you can look
[42:38.440 --> 42:40.920]  at bright part you can look at the drudge report
[42:40.920 --> 42:45.000]  you can look at info wars they've all steadily climbed
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.600]  go and look at the blaze dot com and it's definitely declined
[42:50.600 --> 42:56.200]  because because beck has basically abandoned most of his readership
[42:56.200 --> 42:59.480]  they're furious with him i see it in the comments on the blaze
[42:59.480 --> 43:04.200]  again and again he's lost almost half his web traffic
[43:04.200 --> 43:08.520]  there's a civil war with managers stepping on each other's toes
[43:08.520 --> 43:13.240]  a revolving door of ceo's within his media corporation
[43:13.240 --> 43:17.000]  so now a lot of people are basically saying that this is collapsing the
[43:17.000 --> 43:20.440]  daily beast part of an article saying that you know his empire
[43:20.440 --> 43:24.440]  his media empire is collapsing now we have beck
[43:24.440 --> 43:29.560]  bizarrely lashing out at matt drudge because he quote hangs around with
[43:29.560 --> 43:33.800]  alex jones now you remember the late andrew brightbott
[43:33.800 --> 43:38.040]  who of course was very close with matt drudge worked on the drudge report with
[43:38.040 --> 43:42.360]  matt drudge before he started brightbott.com
[43:42.360 --> 43:46.120]  he wasn't a fan of glenn beck now we've got this clip from brightbott
[43:46.120 --> 43:51.000]  it was december 2011 not long before he died tragically
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.200]  here's what andrew brightbott had to say about glenn beck rolled the clip
[43:56.200 --> 43:59.960]  beck supporters in the past beck has made mistakes
[43:59.960 --> 44:03.080]  and the supporters come out and try to defend him
[44:03.080 --> 44:06.440]  because beck is a coward and will not defend himself
[44:06.440 --> 44:09.640]  when he makes a mistake or lies about the person
[44:09.640 --> 44:13.640]  hold it i want you i want to go hang i want to go back over this
[44:13.640 --> 44:17.560]  you're saying glenn beck's a coward glenn beck's a liar
[44:17.560 --> 44:20.440]  and you're saying glenn beck steals material from people
[44:20.440 --> 44:24.520]  oh yes i mean this is well documented and whenever he does it he never
[44:24.520 --> 44:29.160]  answers to the charges uh he's a coward he will not have me on the
[44:29.160 --> 44:35.800]  radio show he won't have himself on me on gbtv he refused to have me on fox
[44:35.800 --> 44:39.880]  when he threw me under the bus during the charade thing i asked to be on tv or
[44:39.880 --> 44:44.440]  radio to explain why he had it wrong months later
[44:44.440 --> 44:48.920]  we found out why he wouldn't have me on is because he lied to his audience on
[44:48.920 --> 44:51.560]  television
[44:52.680 --> 44:55.880]  so they have andrew brightbott on a radio show
[44:55.880 --> 45:01.400]  basically months before he died calling glenn beck a liar calling him a thief
[45:01.400 --> 45:05.720]  saying that he poached content that he stole content and employees from
[45:05.720 --> 45:10.120]  brightbar.com those are andrew brightbott's allegations
[45:10.120 --> 45:15.320]  basically that he threw him under a bus blocks him from appearing on fox news
[45:15.320 --> 45:18.840]  now where have we heard that before of course glenn beck was
[45:18.840 --> 45:22.600]  instrumental in blocking alex jones from appearing on fox news
[45:22.600 --> 45:27.560]  now it's perfectly acceptable to decide who you don't want on your own show
[45:27.560 --> 45:30.920]  who's content you don't want to feature on your own website
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.240]  that's perfectly fine but when you start to try and exert influence and bully
[45:35.240 --> 45:38.920]  and intimidate other news networks other news outlets
[45:38.920 --> 45:42.680]  into not having people on simply because you've got some kind of bizarre
[45:42.680 --> 45:46.600]  personal grievance with them which glenn beck did to alex jones
[45:46.600 --> 45:49.800]  which he did to andrew brightbott according according to brightbott's
[45:49.800 --> 45:53.320]  own words then that gives you an insight into the
[45:53.320 --> 45:57.240]  personality of glenn beck this is a very vindictive
[45:57.240 --> 46:01.320]  individual this is somebody who is seemingly now
[46:01.320 --> 46:05.080]  lashing out because his media empire is collapsing
[46:05.080 --> 46:10.600]  again lost nearly half of its traffic over the past 18 months
[46:10.600 --> 46:15.080]  coinciding with many of these other conservative websites
[46:15.080 --> 46:19.160]  increasing in popularity having traffic spikes
[46:19.160 --> 46:24.200]  after they either endorsed donald trump or at least gave him a fair shake
[46:24.200 --> 46:28.280]  whereas of course beck has sided with crews at every point which is perfectly
[46:28.280 --> 46:32.280]  fine but it's just this vindictive spiteful attitude
[46:32.280 --> 46:35.160]  he's basically the equivalent of a social justice warrior
[46:35.160 --> 46:40.040]  he's triggered by support for trump so he's lashing out all these different
[46:40.040 --> 46:44.760]  people even matt drudge who is the most polite
[46:44.760 --> 46:49.800]  genteel person you would ever want to meet who has created an umbrella for a
[46:49.800 --> 46:54.600]  diversity of voices on his website who gave the blaze.com
[46:54.600 --> 46:59.880]  the top banner headline today with the loretta lynch story about you know
[46:59.880 --> 47:03.480]  punishing climate deniers so drudge has done nothing
[47:03.480 --> 47:07.400]  against glenn beck he's promoted him he's sent traffic his way
[47:07.400 --> 47:11.240]  but now beck because he has a problem with alex jones and because he has a
[47:11.240 --> 47:13.640]  problem with trump supporters in general
[47:13.640 --> 47:17.000]  is lashing out he's throwing his toys out the pram
[47:17.000 --> 47:21.320]  he's behaving like a cry baby triggered social justice warrior
[47:21.320 --> 47:25.080]  and it's going to be interesting to see how this all boils down if
[47:25.080 --> 47:29.640]  you know that they succeed in aligning support against donald trump
[47:29.640 --> 47:32.840]  which basically guarantees a hillary clinton victory
[47:32.840 --> 47:36.280]  and the fallout of that in the aftermath when it comes to
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.080]  the landscape of conservative media so very interesting that glenn beck would
[47:41.080 --> 47:44.840]  come out not just against you know brightbar.com
[47:44.840 --> 47:48.680]  not against info wars not against alex jones we've seen that before
[47:48.680 --> 47:54.120]  but against matt drudge extremely extremely bizarre i'm sure alex will
[47:54.120 --> 47:57.800]  have his own comments on that when he comes on the show here
[47:57.800 --> 48:01.480]  in around 50 minutes time let's move on to some more news though
[48:01.480 --> 48:05.560]  this is out of zero hedge is the establishment rigging ohio's intentionally
[48:05.560 --> 48:09.480]  confusing ballot against trump this is very
[48:09.480 --> 48:13.160]  interesting this is out of zero hedge and the daily sheeple
[48:13.160 --> 48:16.360]  we all know the elite are on the war path against donald trump with everyone
[48:16.360 --> 48:20.200]  from pundits to major world leaders to the pope speaking out against him
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.200]  newt gingrich recently said it's because trump isn't part the secret societies
[48:24.200 --> 48:28.680]  and hasn't taken the initiation rights we played that clip on the show
[48:28.680 --> 48:33.240]  well now it's being alleged that ohio's g.o.p has intentionally set up a
[48:33.240 --> 48:38.120]  confusing ballot in a bid to try to make sure donald trump does not win
[48:38.120 --> 48:42.120]  now we saw some of these dirty tricks in texas
[48:42.120 --> 48:46.360]  on super tuesday where people would go to vote for trump
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.080]  and they'd come back and see that their ballot had been cast for marco rubio
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.360]  of course it didn't sway the outcome but very bizarre shenanigans
[48:56.360 --> 49:00.600]  now this ballot in ohio if you go to the website you can take a look at this
[49:00.600 --> 49:04.120]  image the republican ballot in ohio this year apparently
[49:04.120 --> 49:07.800]  has two checkmarks leaving a lot more questions and
[49:07.800 --> 49:11.080]  answers about whether or not voters will understand how it works
[49:11.080 --> 49:14.520]  so basically what it is if you want to vote for donald
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.840]  trump in ohio in the primary you have to check
[49:18.840 --> 49:24.920]  two different boxes for donald trump and from what i can see
[49:24.920 --> 49:28.600]  for no one else so you have to actually check two different boxes for donald
[49:28.600 --> 49:33.000]  trump they're saying that this could be used to spoil the ballot and to negate
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.720]  many of these votes for donald trump so again dirty tricks potentially
[49:37.720 --> 49:42.120]  in ohio roger stone was on the show a couple of weeks ago and said that they
[49:42.120 --> 49:47.560]  were investigating that very issue dirty tricks in ohio to negate
[49:47.560 --> 49:51.720]  trump votes so let's keep an eye on that one that one's out of zero hedge
[49:51.720 --> 49:54.360]  now we're going to get into this more after the break but we'll touch on it
[49:54.360 --> 49:58.760]  now this is out the gateway pundit dem debate question
[49:58.760 --> 50:02.280]  hillary clinton will drop out of race if you're indicted we're going to go to
[50:02.280 --> 50:05.640]  this video after the break but it ties into this report
[50:05.640 --> 50:08.680]  out of medium.com which has been circulating on the
[50:08.680 --> 50:12.040]  internet for a few days now but has not received that much traction
[50:12.040 --> 50:15.400]  it's finally beginning to get the attention it deserves
[50:15.400 --> 50:18.920]  one of the leaked emails obtained by gucifer which was handed to
[50:18.920 --> 50:23.320]  rt which basically received no attention whatsoever
[50:23.320 --> 50:27.480]  actually states that the Benghazi attack the assassination of ambassador
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.280]  stevens was financed by none other than Saudi
[50:32.280 --> 50:37.080]  arabia now we know we've had the 28 pages controversy with 9 11
[50:37.080 --> 50:40.200]  now we've got potential evidence of Saudi Arabia
[50:40.200 --> 50:45.960]  being behind the Benghazi attack an apparent attempt by clinton to conceal
[50:45.960 --> 50:50.040]  the details of that in this email so we're going to get to that after the
[50:50.040 --> 50:53.080]  break we're going to play this clip from the debate last night
[50:53.080 --> 50:56.280]  and we're going to get to our guests coming up roger stone ed martin it's

[54:07.160 --> 54:11.880]  beautiful prayer
[54:11.880 --> 54:15.080]  we're back live on the Alex Jones show I'm Paul Joseph Watson
[54:15.080 --> 54:19.080]  this is out the gateway pundit dem debate question Hillary Clinton
[54:19.080 --> 54:23.000]  will drop out of race if you are indicted that's the question that was
[54:23.000 --> 54:28.200]  asked of Clinton during last night's debate here's the clip
[54:28.200 --> 54:32.280]  and now I have a question about your emails your Republican opponents say
[54:32.280 --> 54:35.400]  that those emails have endangered our national security
[54:35.400 --> 54:40.040]  when you were secretary of state you wrote 104 emails in your private server
[54:40.040 --> 54:44.520]  that the government now says contain classified information according to the
[54:44.520 --> 54:48.360]  Washington Post analysis that goes against a memo that you personally
[54:48.360 --> 54:52.600]  sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them
[54:52.600 --> 54:56.200]  to use official email precisely because of security concerns
[54:56.200 --> 54:59.880]  so it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself
[54:59.880 --> 55:02.920]  and a different set of rules for the rest of the state department
[55:02.920 --> 55:07.880]  so who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did
[55:07.880 --> 55:12.840]  was it President Barack Obama and would you draw out of the race
[55:12.840 --> 55:16.120]  if you get indicted well whore hey there's a lot of questions in there and
[55:16.120 --> 55:19.080]  I'm going to give the same answer I've been giving for
[55:19.080 --> 55:22.680]  many months it wasn't the best choice I made a mistake
[55:22.680 --> 55:26.840]  it was not prohibited it was not in any way
[55:26.840 --> 55:30.600]  disallowed and as I've said and as now has come out
[55:30.600 --> 55:35.640]  my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government but
[55:35.640 --> 55:40.200]  but here's the cut to the chase facts I did not send or receive
[55:40.200 --> 55:44.760]  any emails marked classified at the time what you're talking about
[55:44.760 --> 55:48.680]  is retroactive classification and the reason
[55:48.680 --> 55:53.560]  that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information
[55:53.560 --> 55:57.160]  public I asked all my emails to be made public
[55:57.160 --> 56:00.040]  then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in
[56:00.040 --> 56:03.880]  and some other parts of the government we're not exactly sure who
[56:03.880 --> 56:07.320]  has concluded that some of the emails should be now
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.080]  retroactively classified they just said the same thing to former
[56:11.080 --> 56:15.640]  secretary colon powell they have said we're going to retroactively
[56:15.640 --> 56:20.120]  classify emails you said personally now I think
[56:20.120 --> 56:23.000]  he was right when he said this is an absurdity
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.520]  and I think that what we've got here is a
[56:26.520 --> 56:31.560]  case of over classification I'm not concerned about it I am not worried
[56:31.560 --> 56:34.600]  about it and no democrat or american should be
[56:34.600 --> 56:39.160]  either the questions were
[56:43.160 --> 56:46.600]  there was no permission to be asked it had been done by my predecessors
[56:46.600 --> 56:50.280]  it was permitted I didn't have to ask anyone if you get indicted would you
[56:50.280 --> 56:52.440]  drop out oh for goodness and it's not going to
[56:52.440 --> 56:55.960]  happen I'm not even answering that question
[57:00.120 --> 57:03.880]  of course the audience there is packed with clinton supporters trying to give
[57:03.880 --> 57:08.120]  their answer some veneer of legitimacy and she sounds very
[57:08.120 --> 57:11.000]  confident that she's not going to be indicted of course
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.480]  we know the clinton machine is very good at paying off people intimidating people
[57:15.480 --> 57:18.360]  so it's no surprise that she's that confident about it
[57:18.360 --> 57:23.080]  but of course this comes after the justice department granted immunity to
[57:23.080 --> 57:26.760]  the staffer who set up the clinton email server
[57:26.760 --> 57:31.560]  suggesting that he might be about to testify about crimes committed
[57:31.560 --> 57:36.200]  in front of a grand jury and then we've got this out of medium.com
[57:36.200 --> 57:40.360]  missing clinton email claims Saudi's finance Benghazi attacks
[57:40.360 --> 57:45.000]  basically Sydney Blumenthal who is a close clinton confidant clinton's
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.560]  advisor sent her an email to her private server
[57:49.560 --> 57:53.080]  containing intelligence that Saudi Arabia
[57:53.080 --> 57:57.400]  bankrolled planned the Benghazi attack that led to the death of
[57:57.400 --> 58:01.240]  ambassador Christopher Stevens now what's interesting about this
[58:01.240 --> 58:06.120]  email is that it doesn't appear in the emails that the state department has
[58:06.120 --> 58:09.080]  released to the public now let me read this segment from the
[58:09.080 --> 58:12.280]  article because this is key I mean if she's going to be
[58:12.280 --> 58:15.960]  indicted this is basically what they're going to go with if
[58:15.960 --> 58:18.360]  if they can you know carry through with it
[58:18.360 --> 58:21.720]  quote this missing email is certainly something that would have been requested
[58:21.720 --> 58:26.120]  as part of the investigation as it was sent before February 1st
[58:26.120 --> 58:30.920]  and clearly relates to Libya so why is it missing we're going to get into why it's
[58:30.920 --> 58:35.640]  missing after the break on the Alex Jones show breaking news at infowars.com

[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.680]  so hillary clinton is very confident that she won't be
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.920]  indicted over the email scandal but we have this new
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.000]  breaking story about how her close advisor sydney blumenthal
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.280]  sent her an email to a private email server
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.400]  detailing with intelligence information how
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.560]  Saudi Arabia funded and planned the Benghazi attack
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:52.280]  now this email was missing from the official list of emails released
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.080]  publicly by the state department and this medium.com article
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.240]  explains why and explains why this could be a huge new development in the
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.520]  hillary clinton email scandal why it could indeed lead to her
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:09.000]  indictment so from the article this missing email is certainly something
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.960]  that would have been requested as part of the investigation
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.200]  as it was sent before february 1st and clearly relates to libya
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.640]  the fact that it's missing and again this is blumenthal
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.800]  saying to hillary we've got intelligence the Saudis were behind the
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.800]  Benghazi attack bearing in mind Saudi Arabia has
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.520]  been a huge donor to the clinton foundation
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.000]  but why was it missing from the public release by the state department
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.360]  here are two possibilities outlined in this article one
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.240]  the state department does have a copy of this email
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.840]  but deemed it top secret and too sensitive to release
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.880]  even in redacted form this would indicate that sydney blumenthal was sending
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.840]  highly classified information from his aol account to secretary clinton's
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.440]  private email server despite the fact that he never even had a
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.760]  security clearance to deal with such sensitive information in the
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.360]  first place if this scenario explains why the
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.560]  email is missing classified materials were mishandled
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.960]  so this could be absolutely huge here's the second possibility
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.240]  why this email didn't appear in the publicly released list
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.920]  by the state department the state department doesn't have a copy this is
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.920]  the alternative scenario and this email was deleted by both
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:30.600]  clinton and blumenthal before turning over their subpoenaed emails to
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.520]  investigators which would be considered destruction of
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.120]  evidence and lying to federal officials this also
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.560]  speaks to the reason why the private clinton email dot com server
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.880]  may have been established in the first place if blumenthal were to regularly
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:50.440]  send highly sensitive yet technically unclassified information from his aol
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.560]  accounts clinton's official government email account
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.440]  it could have been revealed with the foia request freedom of information act
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.560]  is already been established that hillary clinton deleted
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.440]  15 of sydney blumenthal's emails to her this discrepancy was discovered
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.040]  when blumenthal's emails were subpoenaed although state department official
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.240]  claims that none of these 15 emails have any information
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.000]  about the Benghazi attack it would seem from the subject line
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.760]  that this email does and it's missing from
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:26.200]  the public record that's why this is huge in either of these scenarios
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.720]  clinton and her close associates are in violation of federal law
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.080]  in the most generous interpretation where this email is simply a collection
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.720]  of rumors that blumenthal heard and forwarded unsolicited to clinton
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:42.120]  it would make no sense for it to be missing again if it's no big deal why is
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.640]  it missing from the officially released public emails
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.080]  it would not be classified if it was a bunch of hot air and it certainly
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.360]  wouldn't be deleted by both blumenthal and clinton at the
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.720]  risk of committing a felony in the least generous
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.760]  interpretation of these facts blumenthal and clinton
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.320]  conspired to cover up an ally of the united states
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.680]  funding the assassination of one of our diplomats
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.560]  in libya that's why this is huge we've had the massive controversy over the
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.000]  redacted 28 pages suggesting Saudi Arabian
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.280]  involvement in the 9-11 attacks now we've got intelligence suggesting
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:26.600]  Saudis bankrolling the terrorists that attacked
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:32.040]  the Benghazi consulate of course which for days afterwards was blamed on a
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.600]  youtube video by the Obama administration
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.440]  now it's coming out that this information was sent to clinton in an email it
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.160]  doesn't appear in the publicly released list of
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.160]  state department emails which is now available for everybody to see
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:52.280]  why not why is this one missing is it because it contains highly sensitive
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.400]  material or is it because clinton doesn't want it on the public record
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.600]  will be back with more news after the break stay tuned
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.800]  military drone technology is back in the headlines
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:05.720]  recently sco a subdivision of the u.s military with ties to DARPA
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.600]  release a video of micro drones being launched from an f-16 fighter at 430
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.480]  miles per hour the washington post article titled
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.080]  veil of secrecy lifted on pentagon office planning avatar
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.680]  fighter and drone swarms the announcement also represents another
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.760]  step toward total autonomous military robotics a technology that top experts
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.680]  such as elon musk and max tegmark have been warning scientists to think twice
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.720]  about sco also said in the same announcement they have successfully
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.720]  developed and tested avatar flight technology our new project not
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.160]  previously reported is called avatar and calls for the pentagon to pair
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.160]  high-tech fifth generation fighter jets with unmanned versions of older jets
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.880]  which will be flown without a pilot for the first time
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:49.240]  imagine this technology in the hands of the same government that was also
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.920]  forced to admit this week that it had been using domestic drones for domestic

[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.800]  info wars reporter richard reeves who has of course has been covering the
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.800]  primaries for us for the past couple of months now
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:57.640]  richard cnn's reporting top rubio supporters trump attacks are backfired
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.760]  it was rubio's one saving grace that he looked
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.520]  or was able to act at least presidential now we have him
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.840]  engaging in personal attacks talking about donald trump small hands and
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.560]  making allusions to his penis size not very presidential
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.320]  so is this the end for marco rubio is this the beginning of the collapse of
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.800]  his campaign will it happen before we even get to florida
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.640]  well ball that's exactly what may happen you know and
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.320]  i think uh don trump usually doesn't drop the ball on anything but i think
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.280]  he dropped the ball the other night when he was talking about his hands he
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.360]  should have talked about that they were an indicator of his big big brain
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:41.080]  you know so it uh he is really on the ball on so many things
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:45.320]  now one thing that came out yesterday is that
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.920]  jeb bush is supposed to meet with cruise
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.920]  rubio and casick that meeting is supposed to happen today
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:57.640]  before the before the debate tonight so we can look for
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:02.520]  any kind of surprise right now folks what it is is when marco went
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.000]  negative when marco lost decorum which is another senate that's decorum is a
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.040]  synonym for political correctness which about 25 percent of the republican
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:17.080]  party plus or minus are all about decorum you can be right
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:21.160]  on every issue you can be pro-life pro-constitution you can be right down
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.520]  the line small government conservative etc
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.920]  but when you go outside of decorum like marco rubio did which those were those
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.480]  that's his key block that is his key block of support
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.600]  then boom that's when you saw the single digits
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.200]  coming out you saw him not do that well in super tuesday
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.360]  because he went out of decorum the thursday prior to super tuesday at the
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.680]  university of houston debate you saw him perform poorly super tuesday
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.640]  then you saw it get even worse the saturday afterwards after last
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.360]  thursday when he had another night of debate when he was outside of decorum
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.960]  those folks that establishment faction of the party
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.920]  they're all about decorum another word for that is politically correct
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.080]  activity another word is go along get along which is why
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:15.720]  we're in the situation that we're in because we've had go along get along up
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.800]  there in washington dc for so long so those people aren't able to yet look
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.320]  in the mirror and realize that they're a big part of the
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.640]  problem now that being said let's talk about the dangers to donald trump
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.440]  this is a very dangerous point right now because
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:35.000]  the the powers that be have got their political calipers out
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.600]  and they're looking at all right do we want to
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:43.480]  have rubio dropout maybe perhaps even before the debate
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:47.160]  you know one scenario we could happen is casick
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.760]  and rubio don't come out for tonight's debate and all of a sudden
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.240]  you have the one-on-one with trump and cruz that's a possibility
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.840]  another likely scenario is is they had the discussion
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.960]  they had the debate as scheduled everything goes as planned you could have
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:06.440]  one or both dropout or they could both stay in and then they could evaluate
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:10.760]  all right how did marco do tonight at thursday night's debate
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.440]  i don't think he can rehab himself with his establishment that they were
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.520]  trying to get to come to rubio he cannot rehab himself with one
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.800]  good night of debate so i think they're really looking
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.720]  at having marco rubio step out of the race prior to
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.360]  tuesday's vote in florida they're going to try to in a backhanded fashion
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.040]  shift the establishment votes to ted cruz who has
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:37.160]  good decorum uh they've got the john casick
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.200]  he's got the good decorum you know so they're gonna try not to let him go to
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.400]  casick in florida they want him to go to cruz to try to defeat
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.960]  trump and in ohio casick has got the decorum so they'll
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:52.440]  try to point the establishment to casick or if casick drops out pre-ohio
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.640]  as well then obviously they're gonna point the
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.960]  establishment faction to cruz again so these are the dangers paul
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.040]  and i think it's a very very dubious moment that we have here
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.120]  so you're basically saying that the geop establishment now is putting pressure
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:12.600]  on rubio to take one for the team so that his support will all be handed over
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:16.600]  to ted cruz and basically they're trying to consolidate that because they
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.200]  can't have this split support between casick rubio and
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.400]  ted cruz because it's just not going to be enough to overturn donald trump's
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.120]  surging popularity well in most states you see marco rubio now in
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:32.360]  single digits you see john casick in single digits most states
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.560]  they know that they've got just a very small of a amount of percentage
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.360]  that they can swing one way or another and now
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:43.240]  as alex talked about earlier in the show neil bush joining the finance team
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.080]  of the ted cruz campaign the news of the jeb bush meeting with
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.880]  cruz rubio and casick so i'll tell you what a lot of things are in the works
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.280]  and as miriam witcher the hispanic lady from las vegas that is totally pro trump
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.840]  pointed out marco rubio is looking for a job right
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:01.400]  now he's never going to have more leverage
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.680]  he's never going to have more leverage than he does right now
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.120]  after super tuesday even if he wins florida
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:11.080]  he's still going to have less leverage because mathematically
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:16.440]  he has zero chance almost mathematically of being able to go into
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:22.120]  the rnc in july with a majority with the 1237 1237 delegates
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.040]  his mathematical odds of that right now are are pretty low as a matter of fact
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.240]  even for the frontrunner don trump don trump has to win
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:33.400]  54 percent of all the upcoming delegates
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:38.120]  to get that 1237 number he's only at 43 percent right now so
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.760]  historically over the last few months he's not been able to achieve the
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:47.000]  necessary 50 percent or better he's in a position where he needs 54 percent
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.520]  ted cruz is in a position right now where he needs 62 percent
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.560]  and needless to say marco rubio and casick
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.480]  are you know up there in the high 60s low 70s a percent
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.840]  of upcoming delegates they need to win which may basically means they're
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.960]  mathematically out now like i said marco's looking for a job
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.640]  he can't run for his senate seat he was blocked out of that florida has rules
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.840]  where if you're running for president you can't run for senate you can't be
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.480]  on two places on the ballot in florida so he is out of the senate
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.600]  okay which is great news because he's proven himself to be
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.080]  a tea party trader and so it's great news that marco rubio will not be in the
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.640]  senate but he's not going to be president either
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.080]  unless there's some stroke of genius by the establishment
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.960]  but i just can't imagine it marco's looking for a job
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.840]  it's going to be very easy right now he's got more leverage than ever right
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.000]  now with the establishment it would be very easy for co-brothers or
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.400]  any number of you know jeb bush cronies to come in there and offer marco a
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.800]  sweetheart deal right now to step out
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.800]  now of course one of the problems that the GOP establishment is going to have
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:57.480]  with this brokered convention is the fact we've got this rule 40b which
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.240]  requires the nominee to have the majority of delegates from at least
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.080]  eight states now currently it doesn't appear as if anyone but
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.000]  trump is going to have that do you think they're going to change that rule
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.720]  right before the convention to try and screw over donald trump
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.240]  right see that's one thing if people study robert's rules of order and they
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:20.920]  read different books on it conventions are one and lost
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.960]  before the convention actually happens that's what the convention the rnc
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.160]  is being won or lost right now people talk about a brokered convention
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:33.640]  well when you see a meeting with jeb bush cruise marco rubio and in case it
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:38.120]  that my friends is a facet of a brokered convention
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.640]  so it's going on that rule change could happen
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:45.480]  by the rules committee uh right there meeting before the convention
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.160]  because that's it's one thing that rob did and i reported back in december
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.360]  they're going to bend rules break rules break laws bend laws
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.960]  and potentially they're going to break heads to do what they need to do so
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.080]  that's one thing we do by calling it out on this show
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:05.080]  by exposing what the powers to be could be up to or maybe up to or will be up to
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.880]  that we can stop part of what they're doing because that's like
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:12.040]  in ohio there's all kinds of reports coming out it was reported i think by
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.840]  you or alex earlier that in ohio there's all kinds of
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.720]  regulators as a matter of fact it was you paul you were talking about
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.120]  that the even though ohio primary ballot is confusing where you've got to check
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.240]  two different boxes or names to be able to vote for
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.000]  donald trump so a lot of irregularities in ohio
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.240]  we're going to be looking at that we're going to be studying we're going to be
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.280]  watching and i know roger stone's coming up i'm sure he knows more
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.480]  about ohio than i do but folks i'll tell you what
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.800]  one thing that scares the new world order even more than millions of patriots
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.240]  here in the united states already awake i'll tell you
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.440]  the thing that scares the new world order more than millions of patriots awake
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.720]  here in the u.s and globally thanks to the info wars dot com and the alex
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.360]  jones show and paul watson is networked networked
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:00.440]  and organized networked and organized patriots
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:04.200]  internationally and nationally here in the u.s and a way to do that
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.640]  is how to take your country back from the elite
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:16.120]  become a delegate because if this does become a contestant
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:20.440]  did we loot yeah we lost richard there but yeah he's basically summing up there
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.040]  this is going to be very interesting as we get closer because it doesn't look
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:27.880]  like trump is going to get those 1237 delegates which of
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.560]  course means a brokered convention but they will then have to change the rules
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:36.520]  because only trump would be in a position to take that brokered convention so
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.760]  there's always a there's always a way to fix things right before the convention
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.000]  that's what they've done in the past that's what they'll probably do in the
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.280]  future but we're going to get more into that with ed martin and roger stone
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.680]  coming up as well as alex jones this is the alex jones show live breaking news

[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:20.280]  we've got him back on the line now Richard just finishing off you were
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.720]  talking about rubio trump how they're going to try and
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:28.360]  screw him over possibly at the convention finalizing your comments on
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:32.200]  that issue well the danger is also it's not just
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:36.440]  the convention the convention looms down the road but the immediate danger is
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.200]  if rubio casik dropped out potentially you could have rubio when
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:46.360]  or crews went florida and crews may even went Ohio if casik were to drop out so
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.840]  those are the immediate dangers that they could shift this
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.400]  and then if that happens if crews were to pull out Ohio
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.080]  in florida with that manipulation potential manipulation
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.600]  then all of a sudden that puts trump and crews pretty much tied
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.320]  in the delegate race they're going to be kind of close to tied
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.480]  and they're both going to be in a position where they're going into a
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.440]  contested convention i think if that happens but
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.640]  here's i want to i want to break some news right now paul this is some news i've
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.680]  been needing to report and haven't gotten it out
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:18.200]  since january since january i've been on ted crews
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.400]  you know following him going to several of his events
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:27.880]  and twice in person info warriors twice in person i have invited personally
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.120]  ted crews come on the alex general show the info wars dot com show
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:36.760]  and through subordinates i've invited him three or four times probably total of
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:41.800]  six times county two personally he said oh yeah yeah let's make that happen
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.240]  well info warriors when you're out there and you visit ted crews out there on
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.200]  the campaign trail let's ask him why will he
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.520]  have a meeting with jeb bush tonight why will he hire neil bush
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:57.160]  for his finance team but why will he not come on info wars dot com the alex
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.760]  jones show so that's what i'd like to ask of ted crews at this point
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.840]  now another thing is i think on a different
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:09.400]  pivot point is that trump has not tapped into two big groups of voters that i
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.000]  think he can get and if if we have a premature rubio
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.960]  dropout and a premature premature casick dropout
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.040]  one thing trump needs to do is reach out immediately for these two blocks of
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:23.320]  voters low hanging fruit that i know he can get
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.400]  one block of voter that i know he can get is from the cruise campaign if donald
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.280]  trump will talk constitution at somewhat close to the level
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:36.440]  that cruise talks constitution then i think a lot of cruisers
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.800]  are ready to come to trump but they're scared that he doesn't talk about the
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.280]  constitution enough so they're scared of that so
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:46.360]  he can get a good chunk of cruise voters if he talks about the constitution
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:50.120]  now another thing is trump is always exposing a lot of true items
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.320]  he can expose the fact look the democrats primaries are so rigged
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.800]  that bernie is politically dead man walking they're gonna give it to hillary
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:03.320]  it's a done deal the only reason i think they keep it competitive i think the
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.680]  new world order rigs that primary between hillary and
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.200]  and bernie to try to keep it interesting is because they know a lot of that
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.040]  anti-establishment vote that goes to bernie will come to trump
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.720]  either now or in the prime in the general for sure so i think trump
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:21.640]  should just call it out he should come out on the debate or on the sunday talk
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.480]  shows this weekend and say look you guys you democrats are ready to dump the
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:30.360]  establishment come on over bernie's done hillary's in let's get let's get it
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:34.200]  going it's gonna be trump hillary running for the general
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.080]  there richard because we're coming up on the break but thanks for joining it
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.200]  joining us richard reeves of course after the break
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.440]  alex jones is coming up with roger stone to drop some more
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.920]  info on the latest with trump rubio ted cruise and the rest of it
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:53.240]  but we've got the hill dot com reporting and this is key
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.680]  how twitter is attempting to shape the democratic primary
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:00.920]  twitter is important is fueled revolutions throughout the world it's
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.600]  not just a social media platform to share cat pictures
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.720]  you look at egypt tunisia libya all those governments had to shut down twitter
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.640]  to try and prevent these revolutions which eventually happened
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.920]  so it should be a shock to americans reports the hill
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.440]  recently in our own country a grassroots hashtag
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:24.360]  has been used to debate the stances of one of our own presidential candidates
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:30.040]  and it was shut down by twitter not by the u.s government by twitter
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.960]  the same twitter that lobbied for net neutrality and to keep twitter alive
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.600]  around the world so basically of course you had this
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.600]  confrontation between a black lives matter protester and hillary clinton
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:44.040]  about a week ago now just over a week ago that began
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:48.680]  trending on twitter they shut down the hashtag
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.480]  and replaced it with a hashtag say something good about twitter
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:58.440]  so now they're actively shutting down the hashtag in this case which hillary
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:03.320]  to deflect criticism of hillary clinton at this crucial time
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:08.520]  so now we've got documented proof on top of all the censorship of conservative
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.560]  voices the shadow banning kicking people off twitter
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:15.960]  entirely that they're now trying to game the hashtags
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.720]  so that americans voting in this year's presidential election
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:25.000]  won't find out about hillary clinton and her dubious past
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.800]  this is crucial again this emphasizes how social media has become key
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:33.880]  in shaping not just in motions we had the huge facebook study where they
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:36.520]  actually were able to change people's emotions
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.840]  but now potentially the next president of the united states will get into it
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:43.320]  more later in the show but alex jones is coming
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:47.960]  off it's the alex jones show live info wars dot com don't go anywhere
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:58.600]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:02.360]  glenn beck opened his radio show today going off on what the hell has happened
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.240]  to matt drudge the conservative radio host was spurred
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:09.800]  on this morning by drudge photoshopping rubio as a midget after he didn't win a
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.560]  single state last night beck said ever since drudge started hanging out with
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:16.280]  alex jones he's gone to this weird conspiratorial
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:20.040]  place where he can't even trust any news coming from him anymore
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.680]  well no one really likes you beck so get over it
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:26.360]  fox news reports little marco rubio to suspend campaign
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.960]  and take on a full-time job at a phone party in miami no i'm just playing but
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.840]  ted cruise better not tweet that link there's an article up by truce revolt
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:37.160]  ongoing will he or won't he drama has fox news reporting today that his big
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:41.000]  donors are pressuring marco rubio to drop out of the race immediately when cnn
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.680]  aired a similar report two days ago the drama was high as rubio's communications
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.480]  manager storm cnn to set the record straight that his
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:51.320]  candidate was not even entertaining the notion and three hours ago fox news
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:55.160]  aired a very similar report and earlier today cbs did the same

[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.520]  from deep in the heart of texas broadcasting worldwide
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:51.560]  paul joseph watson is co-hosting with us from her britannic majesties london
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:55.800]  england and the one the only uh trump confidant friend of 40 years former
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.880]  head of his campaign a guy out there doing great battle against
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:04.600]  the anti-trump forces across the land is of course roger stone i'm going to
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.400]  punch out of here in a moment and come back
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:11.400]  some in the fourth hour because i just want to have a fresh perspective on an
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.360]  interview with stone we've had a lot of powerful interviews with him he has
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.960]  revealed dozens and dozens and dozens of big stories
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:22.520]  months and weeks before it actually breaks so we can get the inside baseball
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.080]  and where he sees this campaign going with trump and how they're going to
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:28.360]  battle back against it uh what he sees with the broger
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.040]  conventions that he first warned of richard reeves six months ago here on
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:35.560]  this very broadcast now it's in us today now it's in the
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.440]  wall street journal now it's in the washington post going yeah it's no big
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:42.360]  deal we just won't let you have it they're trying to mainline
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:46.200]  this type of corruption like yeah the tpp secret the hands over our total
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:50.280]  sovereignty the secret multinationals no big deal
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.880]  so that's what they're doing but but we're here raising the alarm and the
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:58.120]  american people have never in modern history been
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:01.320]  this awake you heard me a year ago six months ago say this is a historic
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.600]  moment we're entering a crossroads people are upset
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.760]  they're angry the the system is collapsing like a rotten barn in a
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:14.280]  in a tornado the facade is coming down from the establishment termites
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.880]  eating through their own system greedily
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.240]  nothing like this in modern politics has ever happened and because
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:24.600]  we weren't in the technotronic era before this nothing has happened like
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:28.600]  this in us history probably world history so the phenomenon
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:32.920]  will be studied for hundreds of years into the future if we even survive as a
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.880]  planet and as a species the stakes are that high
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:39.000]  they're that dangerous with north korea threatening to nuke south korea the
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.600]  russians threatening to invade the the time of crisis is here because a
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.360]  great time of change is here and a lot of forces are scrambling
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:50.040]  to be on top as the new order comes in whatever new order
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:53.400]  that's going to be now paul watson is going to conduct this interview i just
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.160]  want to congratulate roger stone and donald trump and all the trumpian
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.960]  supporters because now we know ted cruise who i likely did the senate
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.080]  who i want to believe in because he's from here in texas at least you know he's
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.520]  a texas senator he's from canada no big deal i don't care you can be a you know
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.040]  adopted son here it's just that using that mantle
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.920]  he's got a lot of conservatives libertarians to go with him but now
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:18.440]  having the bush team and marvin bush probably the most evil of the bushes
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.480]  when it comes to you know white collar operations
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:25.880]  coming in uh and and and running his finance campaign with other bush
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.240]  backing uh really really is serious because rubio's
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:32.360]  shanking so i guess we'll start there roger you're only with us for
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.000]  20 more minutes till the end of the hour i want paul to be able to conduct the
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.440]  interview but i've kind of set the floor here for what we're talking about
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:41.080]  have i kind of laid out some of the key points we should cover
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.440]  yeah and i think you've uh you've hit right on it look uh we now know that
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:49.560]  there was a secret meeting carl rove attended uh mich mcconnell was there
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:53.800]  paul ryan some internet billionaires billionaires on top of
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.120]  billionaires uh all frantic to stop donald trump now
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:03.080]  alex you and i have seen this movie in 1964 when the conservative movement took
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.680]  over the republican party at the grassroots and the establishment
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:10.280]  rockefeller scranton romney's father didn't wake up until
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.320]  late and then they went hysterical he's a madman golden
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.280]  mortars a madman he's a racist he's a bigot
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:20.040]  he is unfit to be president he's mentally unstable
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.040]  he'll start a nuclear war he'll push the button uh and of course those were all
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.600]  lies uh to stop the uh the revolution it's now back for another
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.600]  for another uh a go so absolutely i'm just going to say this in closing and
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.160]  hand it back over to you and paul's going to conduct the interview
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:39.240]  mr stone but stonezone.com we sell both of your new best-selling books
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:43.720]  on the bush crime family and of course uh on the sex crimes of the clinton's
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:48.040]  in full war store.com uh back to you roger congratulations on
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:51.880]  all your great work and paul you take it over
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:55.800]  questions the politics i just this interests me because this is a story
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.320]  that i've covered on a basically daily basis now
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:03.720]  the explosion of threats towards donald trump on twitter we had a new york
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.880]  times columnist a couple of weeks ago joking about his assassination
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:12.680]  we had another leftist activist yesterday joking about his assassination
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:16.920]  we've got an egyptian guy who's basically agreed to be deported because he made a
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.040]  direct death threat against donald trump
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:23.560]  you know trump's had secret service protection since last year
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:27.480]  you came out with a revelation that he wears a bullet proof vest at most of
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.560]  his events are you concerned for the safety of donald trump at this point
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.320]  given all these threats? well i think he is in harm's way because
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.920]  he's a truth teller and anytime in american politics we've had a truth
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.520]  teller uh you know perhaps it was john f kennedy
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.960]  being a perfect example uh the powers that be have
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:50.360]  removed him so uh trump is demonstrating enormous physical
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.480]  and personal courage by continuing to go to these
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.840]  enormous rallies now everybody who attends the rally
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:00.840]  is theoretically uh supposed to go through a mag machine
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:04.680]  to ensure that they have no weapons uh with them
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:08.680]  uh but there have been breakdowns in that system that i'm aware of
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:15.160]  uh so it is uh it is of concern to me uh at the same time uh it's it is uh
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:18.920]  perfectly acceptable for say this fellow wilson
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:22.600]  uh from tallahassee a a political consultant
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:26.440]  to say on twitter that somebody should put a bullet in trump
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:32.600]  but then to be a commentator for cnn on politics this is the same
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:38.520]  wilson who said that donald trump must be having anal sex with
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:43.720]  inculter on twitter yet he is an esteemed member of the cnn
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:49.320]  commentary lineup so one wonders about uh their judgment there at cnn as you
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.800]  know i of course have been banned because i'm too much of a truth teller
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:58.120]  whether it is the true uh sexual predator record of the
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:02.120]  clintons and hillary's rolling covering it up or whether it is the origins of
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:05.160]  9 11 uh i don't think you know the clinton news
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:09.800]  network is uh would rather air mr wilson than myself
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:14.120]  do you think that ban that cnn ban came directly from the clintons on order of
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.200]  the clintons then well we know that pressure was put on cnn by
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.480]  the pressure group media matters for america which is a george soros
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:27.800]  funded front and of course cnn was uh they folded
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:31.960]  the idea of any news organization folding to the demands of a specific
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:35.480]  pressure group right or left is antithetical to the
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:40.840]  idea of a free press so their motives i think are clear on the other hand
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:45.320]  in all honesty on any given day you can reach far more people here at info
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:48.360]  wars dot com than you could ever hope to reach
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:54.760]  on cnn this is the new media they are the dying old media
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.840]  now getting back into trump of course he needs this magic number of delegates
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.800]  1237 looks like that's going to be an uphill struggle going forward
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:08.360]  then we've got this rule 40 b with the convention which of course states that
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:12.280]  the nominee has to have a majority of delegates from at least eight states to
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:15.080]  be a viable contender at that convention
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.280]  do you think that they're going to change the rule right before that
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.040]  convention just to try and basically screw over trump
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.880]  well they're actually required to change the rule uh rule 40 b expires it has to
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:33.000]  either be amended or replaced or entirely repealed you see
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.960]  the republican national convention is not governed by state or federal law
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.000]  it's governed owned by only by its own rules
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.360]  therefore the credentials committee could theoretically
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.120]  look at the states where ted cruise has won that have employed
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:52.440]  what appears to be a pattern of voter irregularity and outright voter fraud
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:55.880]  we have reports of this in texas we have reports of this in oklahoma
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:59.720]  we have reports of this in kansas we have reports of this in main
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:03.880]  we have reports of this in hawaii and now we have early reports of a monkey
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:08.280]  in with the absentee ballots in ohio uh and we haven't even gotten to the
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:12.360]  florida primary yet so the convention could conceivably
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:16.440]  trump could conceivably challenge those delegations is having been fraudulently
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:19.720]  elected and have them replaced at the convention
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:23.320]  unclear whether he would have the votes to do that
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:29.320]  but recognize that he would still get to cleveland with the largest single block
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:33.080]  of delegates and that really puts you in a very strong position
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.520]  even if he fell short on the first ballot
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:41.480]  doesn't reach the magic 1237 which he may not because
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:45.160]  the primaries going forward here are proportional most of them
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.600]  there's actually some question about whether california is winner take all
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:52.280]  due to some ambiguity there in the in the rules
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.960]  so uh if trump does not run the table
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.360]  meaning win everything he can't afford to lose even small contests like hawaii
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:04.360]  or portorico or the virgin islands all of which he lost
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.800]  it's now a delegate game so um it it remains to be seen
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:11.400]  meanwhile the establishment is playing a multi-handed
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:15.880]  game in other words i'm not sure whether the uh the white knight for the
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.720]  establishment is mitt romney or whether it is uh or
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:23.160]  whether it is uh paul ryan or whether it is
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:28.120]  uh uh john casick i don't think we know that yet they'd all like to be the
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:32.040]  anti-trump and they're all at the table with their block of delegates not to
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:35.960]  mention of course ten crews now i wanted to
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:39.640]  touch on romney as he did just then of course a few weeks ago he suddenly
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:42.200]  emerged out of nowhere to start attacking
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:46.280]  donald trump that kind of backfired uh you speculated
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.040]  with your inside sources that he could be put forward as a candidate that he
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:54.200]  could enter the race he's since denied that on a couple of occasions
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:58.120]  do you see do you still think that romney is a potential candidate to enter
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:02.840]  this race or has that basically failed now no actually i think he already has
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:06.600]  entered the race to be the compromised candidate
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:11.160]  that the convention turns to the rules committee could pass a rule saying
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:14.440]  you're not required to have received any delegates whatsoever
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.920]  to be considered by this convention see the depending on who's running and has a
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.760]  majority at the convention and in these pivotal committees
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.840]  but romney is uh he's all warmed up and he's in the bullpen he's got his makeup
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:30.760]  on and he's waiting for his 15 minutes whether or not he gets in the race
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:34.520]  formally and tries to win some late delegates in california
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:37.960]  and new jersey depends on the results of march 15
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:41.400]  remember the filing deadlines for some of the late primaries
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.960]  go as late as late april you could still contend in california new jersey and
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:51.320]  several other large states so it's not over uh till it's over i did predict
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:55.800]  right here that romney would be blasting uh trump and maybe making his
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:58.920]  availability known uh i think he's waiting to see what
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.840]  happens to marco before he decides whether to become a candidate
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:08.920]  or how formal his candidacy should take in terms of form
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:12.040]  now the polls show as of this moment that
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:17.160]  ruby on crews have a good shot at beating hillary clinton in a potential
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:21.560]  runoff trump's obviously still behind clinton in a lot of these polls
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.640]  are donald trump supporters going to vote for a candidate handpicked by the
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.160]  gop establishment if they feel cheated by this
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.960]  brokered convention that you're talking about
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:35.800]  no i think the real problem here of course is that any net results probably
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:41.000]  tears the party in half uh even the nomination of trump some
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.840]  establishment republicans will go support hillary i say let them go
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:48.440]  trump unlike these other candidates can bring in
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.040]  millions of people who aren't voting today millions of people who stopped
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:55.080]  voting millions of people who are new to the process or
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.520]  millions of people who are disgusted they stopped voting because they figured
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:01.240]  out that both parties are the same and it doesn't really matter
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:04.600]  so i think he can bring new people to the process that nobody else
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.400]  can offsetting any losses he may have get he may get among republicans
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.240]  on the other hand if there's a compromise candidate if somebody is jammed
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:16.680]  down the throat of the convention and trump gets to cleveland with the
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:19.640]  largest chunk of delegates this close to the nomination
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.560]  and he is denied it this nomination won't be worth having
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:28.520]  those millions of trump voters don't vote for a other republican nominee
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:33.240]  and the election is lost i think trump has made this case very articulately
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:37.080]  himself so uh i'm not concerned about polls that
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:41.560]  show him slightly behind hillary clinton in all those polls he is as we say in
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:44.440]  the business in range and he hasn't opened fire on
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.560]  hillary yet he's only engaged her on a few matters
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:50.680]  such as her husband's history as a sexual predator
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:54.920]  and her role as a an accessory after the fact in his sex crimes
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:58.600]  and she recoiled she said she's not going to discuss it anymore
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:02.200]  that round went to donald j trump uh he's fearless
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:05.400]  he's a brawler he understands that you're gonna have to
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:10.280]  grab her and pull her down you can't metaphorically of course rhetorically
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:14.120]  you can't go around the country as john mccain did
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:17.480]  praising barack obama is a great senator and a great american
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.000]  you're gonna have to take her on in a very aggressive way
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.480]  she's going to scream sexism and that you're a brute and so on but
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:29.000]  it's the fact you have to make your case on the facts her
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.800]  her abusive women her horrific record as secretary
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:38.360]  of state and of course the epic thievery of the clinton foundation or but three
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:43.720]  of the issues that i think she is incredibly vulnerable on
[01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:49.000]  now by the same token i was wondering if it is trump versus clinton if that's
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.920]  the presidential runoff is it going to be an added philip
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:56.600]  to trump the potential that he will get all these
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:00.520]  voters that would have supported bernie sanders because i can imagine that
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:04.360]  all those bernie sanders voters who become you know disenfranchised if hillary
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.960]  gets the nomination they're not going to vote for somebody like rubio
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:11.320]  they're not going to vote for ted cruise but many of them would vote
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.760]  for donald trump as an anti-establishment candidate
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:18.920]  do you agree with that i think that's a very very astute observation look i
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.560]  think that the bernie even bernie's support is not
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:24.920]  monolithic bernie has supporters who are on the hard
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:28.360]  left and they won't be voting for donald trump he's too much of a free
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:32.200]  enterprise and too much of a conservative but there are a bunch of
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.040]  voters voting for bernie who are very much like the voters who are voting for
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.560]  trump they're angry they're disaffected they do see the
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:43.880]  million the billionaire class and the wall street class having it all
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:47.400]  trump is the first guy in this race who's called for additional taxes on
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:51.400]  hedge fund managers then jeb was for forced to follow him
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:55.400]  so uh they they kind of share trump's populist message
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.720]  i think those are the voters that will move to donald trump trump has to make a
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:04.680]  a concerted effort to attract them uh because at the end of the day although i
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.680]  think bernie has hit his stride rhetorically tell the billionaires they
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.080]  can't have it all pretty good stuff i don't think he will rest the nomination
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:17.640]  for millery clinton now i just wanted to touch on
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:21.400]  hillary's email scandal because we had the the staffer yet
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.040]  last week i believe given immunity by the justice department he can now testify
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:30.040]  in front of a grand jury which it looks like that's what might happen
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:35.720]  we also had this uh strange email leak where one of the emails talks about
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:40.760]  Benghazi being funded by the Saudis that wasn't included in the official
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:44.840]  publicly released state department list of clinton emails
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:48.360]  how likely do you think this indictment of hillary is
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.800]  given a confidence in the debate last night where she basically
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:56.600]  uh brushed it aside completely do you think an indictment is likely
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:01.320]  uh look i have no particular inside information has she violated the law
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:06.600]  without question does that require the proof of intent no it doesn't criminal
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.040]  negligence alone would be enough for an indictment
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:14.200]  there is a prepundant rinse of evidence there's also precedent which we've
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.840]  seen americans like general david patryas
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.880]  prosecuted for misuse of top secret documents
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:24.360]  and had his career ruined uh now the other question though is not what does the
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:27.320]  fbi find and what did they recommend i think
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:31.880]  the fbi will recommend her indictment it's what does this political justice
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:36.040]  department do and what leverage does hillary have hillary
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:40.120]  i think uh will uh will probably get a walk from
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:44.040]  from the obama administration otherwise they're afraid that she will
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:47.240]  nail the other valerian jerry's role in vanguards
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:52.920]  bringing the hits the scandal back okay
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:56.680]  that's the next okay we'll be back with roger stonestonezone.com

[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:19.960]  former trump advisor and close trump confidant roger stone
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:23.880]  stonezone.com roger just wanted to ask you a quick
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:27.960]  final question we had new gingrich appear on fox news last week
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:31.720]  he basically said the establishment hates trump because he wasn't part of a
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:35.320]  secret society and didn't partake in the rituals
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:40.040]  my question is there panic at a trump presidency merely born out of the fact
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:43.240]  that you know he's unpredictable he's hard to control
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:47.080]  or is it more than that and do you think they have a chance of controlling
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:51.240]  trump if he gets into the oval office
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:01.320]  the american people and that is precisely why the lobbyist class this is
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:05.320]  the the consultant class the political establishment the two
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:12.360]  party duopoly the bush clinton bush obama
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:17.160]  bush or clinton or trump continuum is so upset
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:20.760]  this is a putiation of 30 years of failed policies
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.800]  the neocon adventurous foreign policy disastrous fiscal policies that have
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:29.000]  left us broke disastrous immigration policies
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.240]  that have left our streets unsafe disastrous trade policies that have put
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:37.960]  us at a billion dollar disadvantage these people have destroyed our economy
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:42.040]  and they're destroying our country and people are upset about it so upset that
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:46.200]  they're ignoring the propaganda war being paid for by the billionaires and
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:50.040]  this deluge of television ads attacking for trump for trump
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:54.200]  university which is an absurdity a real estate course
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:59.560]  and the american people are not buying into the big media smears of trump as a
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:04.680]  nazi as a hitler as a fanatic it's hysterical is what you're getting
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.280]  you're getting hysteria from the anti-trump forces and i think it's
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:12.280]  backfiring look when you've been attacked by the pope when you've been
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:15.080]  attacked by the chinese government when you've been attacked by the former
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:20.440]  president of mexico vincente box and now being compared to that being
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:26.280]  attacked by mit romney is like being bit by a mosquito
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:30.520]  all right that's going to wrap it up roger stonestonezone.com thanks for
[01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:34.200]  joining us great to be here many thanks there goes roger
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:38.440]  stone will be sure to have him back on the show very shortly in the next
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:42.120]  segment we've got ed martin which is interesting because he wrote an article
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.960]  with roger stone how the gop insiders plan to steal the
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:50.280]  nod from trump that was on breitbart.com about a week ago
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:53.560]  so we're going to delve more into that we've also got
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:57.880]  more news items to cover again getting back to this because it's so crucial
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:01.400]  how twitter is attempting to shape the democratic primary
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:07.160]  this is now confirmed that twitter is censoring hashtags on their own
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:10.600]  platform to make hillary clinton look good
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:15.720]  to hide hillary clinton scandals it's openly confirmed now that they censored
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:19.240]  the witch hillary hashtag which of course began
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:23.080]  trending after hillary was confronted by the black lives matter
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:28.200]  protester basically accusing her of being a racist not good publicity
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.360]  it started to go viral that hashtag was killed
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:35.720]  and now it emerges and perhaps we'll have time later in the show to play this
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:39.640]  clip that twitter is now shutting down
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:43.640]  anonymous account members of the activist group anonymous
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:49.240]  for quote harassing extremists that's right if you actually criticize
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:53.560]  isis supporters twitter is now suspending
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:58.520]  deleting those accounts which is quite interesting given the
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:04.040]  back in october saudi arabia which of course has been funding isis
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:09.000]  all along the way basically became twitter's second biggest shareholder
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.840]  saudi arabia of course donates generously
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:17.000]  to the clinton foundation which is why we have this related story about the
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.040]  email potentially being censored about the
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:26.360]  saudi's bankrolling the Benghazi attack so now this all is beginning to tie
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:29.640]  together and twitter is censoring people who
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:35.640]  criticize isis supporters and of course it's defending hillary clinton we'll
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:37.960]  be back with ed martin after the break in four

[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:22.680]  of the info war
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:29.080]  the final era of the alex jones show ed martin of billis
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:32.760]  schlafly's eagle forum is coming up in the next segment to talk about how they're
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:35.000]  going to try and steal the nomination from
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:38.600]  donald trump top story on info wars dot com right now
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:43.080]  former u.s. attorney grand jury is investigating hillary
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:46.680]  the former u.s. attorney says that he believes a grand jury has been convened
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:50.760]  to investigate hillary clinton over her homegrown email server
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:55.960]  quote the bureau has between 100 and 150 agents assigned to the case they would
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:59.720]  not have that many people assigned to a classified information case
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:05.400]  this attorney told the daily caller so it looks like that may indeed be happening
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:10.280]  we've also got this story from kit daniels mass exodus thousands of lifelong
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:14.760]  democrats jump to trump now we saw this in ohio
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:18.600]  i talked about that earlier this week on the show where we had a thousand
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:23.400]  democrats in one county alone registered to become republicans so they could vote
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:26.760]  for donald trump now we have over 46 000
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:30.680]  pennsylvania democrats of switch parties to vote for donald trump
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:33.800]  joining thousands of other lifelong democrats in blue states
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:39.240]  doing the exact same thing so again many of these bernie sanders supporters
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.600]  probably a minority given their political outlook
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:46.120]  are likely to vote for trump far more likely than they're going to vote for
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:50.120]  ted cruise or marco rubio should hillary clinton
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:54.040]  be bernie sanders which appears almost inevitable at this point
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:58.520]  but switching back to this twitter issue again twitter has now been called
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:03.320]  censoring trending hashtags to hide hillary clinton
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:08.680]  scandals to hide dirt about her now we've also got twitter banning
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:16.120]  anonymous accounts a quote harassing isis extremists here's the clip from rt
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.400]  but activists from the anonymous hackers group which targets the feeds of isle
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:28.920]  supporters claim their accounts have been suspended too
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:32.760]  we spoke to one of them he asked for his voice to be disguised
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:37.320]  in the last uh about two months we've had literally dozens of accounts suspended
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:42.120]  my account went down without notification uh never received an email or anything
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:44.680]  from twitter and about two hours later it came back
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:47.640]  but at the same time 15 other accounts went down
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:52.200]  had a few accounts that did receive an email all it stated was a table uh
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.600]  violated the tawhiz other accounts received no notification there's still
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:00.280]  many accounts that have been suspended and not reinstated
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.440]  the ban comes amid twitter strengthening its rules on online harassment
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:09.400]  we asked the company to comment on the suspension of the accounts
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:12.680]  we condemn the use of twitter to promote terrorism
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:16.120]  and the twitter rules make it clear that this type of behavior
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:20.920]  or any violent threat is not permitted on our service
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:25.320]  the anonymous activists also accused twitter of not taking into account their
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:29.480]  work in helping to identify and suspend isle linked accounts
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:33.560]  they add that if it wasn't for their efforts twitter would be flooded with
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:38.600]  terrorists previously the hackers group declared war on islamic state
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:42.280]  anonymous will hunt you islamic state all across the world
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:46.760]  you are parasites that kill the innocent we will find you and we'll never let you
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:49.480]  go get ready for a massive blowback from
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:53.240]  anonymous and numerous cyber attacks the war has started
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:57.080]  beware the anonymous activist we spoke to
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:00.920]  says the ongoing fight against islamic state is making the terrorists lose
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:06.120]  ground online literally thousands of accounts
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:10.680]  are going down uh and it used to be that the accounts were coming
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:15.720]  right back i can see now that that in the end
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:19.880]  more accounts aren't coming back and we are actually slowing them down
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.200]  the size of the accounts have shrunken and i think they're losing losing grip
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:27.240]  on what they're doing their online activity has
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:31.160]  actually went down uh they're not as active in
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:34.440]  in as fierce as they used to be fight that we are fighting right now on
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:38.120]  twitter is focusing on removing graphic content
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:43.400]  from islamic state terrorists so our children don't have to see it
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:47.160]  so there you have it twitter banning people who quote harass
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:50.760]  isis extremist amazing censorship will be back
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:55.480]  after break with ed martin of the phyllis slafley's eagle form to talk about
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:05:01.800]  donald trump stay tuned military drone technology is back in the headlines
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:05.720]  recently sco a subdivision of the u.s military with ties to darpa
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:10.600]  release a video of micro drones being launched from an f-16 fighter at 430
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:13.480]  miles per hour the washington post article titled
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:17.640]  veil of secrecy lifted on pentagon office planning avatar fighter
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:21.480]  and drone swarms the announcement also represents another step toward total
[02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:25.080]  autonomous military robotics a technology that top experts such as
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:28.360]  elon musk and max tegmark have been warning scientists to think
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:31.160]  twice about sco also said in the same announcement they have
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:35.480]  successfully developed and tested avatar flight technology our new project
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:39.160]  not previously reported is called avatar and calls for the pentagon to pair
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:43.160]  high-tech fifth generation fighter jets with unmanned versions of older jets
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:45.880]  which will be flown without a pilot for the first time
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:49.560]  imagine this technology in the hands of the same government that was also forced
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:52.920]  to admit this week that it had been using domestic drones for domestic

[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:44.200]  ed welcome to the show great thanks thanks for having me on paul joseph great
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:47.800]  to be with you now you wrote this bright bar piece
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:51.880]  back now a couple of weeks ago with roger stone how the gop insiders plan to
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:55.160]  steal the knot from trump it remains to be seen whether
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:59.560]  trump can get this magic number of delegates 1237
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:03.800]  we've also got this rule 4cb with the convention
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:07.000]  which requires a nominee have the majority of delegates from at least
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.240]  eight states if trump doesn't achieve that delegate number which it looks like
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:15.080]  you know it's going to be a struggle just outline for the listeners the process
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:19.400]  by which the gop establishment is going to try and steal this from him
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:23.000]  at a broken convention yeah well listen and this is very important i know
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.600]  everybody's focused on the races are upcoming on tuesday and a week after
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:29.480]  and a week after but as you look towards cleveland
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:32.280]  you've got to figure out what the playbook is
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:35.880]  that has been used in the past and how it can be used again and so there's a
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:39.560]  couple of key points number one is when you get to the
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:43.880]  convention if you're a delegate you first have to go before the credentials
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:47.720]  committee and in the past one of the ways to block
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:50.840]  conservatives from being seated or actually just anyone is to use a
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:54.200]  credentials committee the credentials committee is made up of
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:00.040]  56 times two that's 50 states plus six territories who are all considered
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:03.640]  members the rnc they each get two members now think of this
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:07.800]  guam gets two members on the credentials committee and so does california
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:10.840]  texas gets to and so does northern mariana silo now
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:14.680]  you say to yourself that's crazy those six little stay in the territories are
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:18.840]  going to have an outsized influence and they tend to be influenced by
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:22.440]  wait for it the establishment and so here's the thing you're going to have a
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:26.200]  vote on credentials first to see how you seat the delegates and for example
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:29.480]  what if rubio drops out next week after he doesn't do well on
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:32.760]  florida rubio's delegates are supposed to vote
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:37.080]  for rubio on the pledged first round what if some of the rubio delegates start
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:40.680]  announcing we're going to vote for uh a cruise or we're going to vote for
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:44.360]  uh somebody else they could not be seated they could be blocked from being
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:47.800]  seated for being outwardly against the candidate they're pledged to
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.160]  that that's just one choke point the next choke point is the rules committee
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:54.680]  same drill 56 states times two 112 members
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:58.040]  and they're going to be setting the rules for the convention
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:01.160]  people don't realize this the day before the convention
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:04.600]  all of the rules under which they are currently operating
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:08.520]  expire and they must be ruled again they must be voted on again
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:11.640]  now so think about this if you called the rnc right now and said
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:15.800]  i'm um joe blow i'm running i want to run for president how do i get nominated
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:19.880]  they would point you to rule 40 they wouldn't tell you that rule 40 expires
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:23.720]  the day before the convention but it does and so what we know we have another
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:27.480]  choke point where a rules committee made up of generally more establishment
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:31.160]  leaning uh delegates will make a decision about
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:35.160]  what the rules can be and here's an example current rule 40 says you must
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.880]  have a majority of permanently seated majority of a
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:40.760]  permanently seated delegates that's a credentials fight
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:45.000]  of at least eight states but that rule expires what if they put in a rule that
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.120]  says you have to have the support of any delegate
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:51.800]  well they're only a handful of free agent delegates so-called super delegates
[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:54.760]  but what if one of those delegates stood up and said i'm for paul ryan
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:58.200]  and he can be nominated i mean this is the kind of hijinks that's going to go
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:00.760]  on if people aren't aware of it and ready to
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:06.440]  fight back and kind of engage fully and that that delegate count you know the
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.040]  majority of delegates from at least eight states that can be amended to any
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:12.120]  number and this has happened before they
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:16.280]  they used it to get ron paul out of the way that's correct right
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:19.400]  exactly that's exactly right so that that that delegate they could decide it's
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.520]  five before so what this is a good example the ron paul
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:26.680]  listeners will remember in tampa when they when they got to the tampa
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:30.280]  convention the rules committee met and the romney boys came in the guy's
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:34.840]  name is ben ginsburg and he said let's change that to a majority of
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:40.760]  eight states from a plurality of five states that was meant to block ron paul
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:43.720]  from being put into nomination they didn't want him to speak
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:47.320]  my point is that they're going to be a group that are going to be establishment
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:50.840]  leaning that are going to pass rules like that and and remember
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:54.120]  you know one of the key things on rules motions and rules
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:58.920]  is that whoever acts first owns the the framework of the debate i don't know if
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:01.960]  you've seen this much uh well joseph you know we get to a
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:05.000]  meeting in it whoever file makes the first motion
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.880]  tends to frame the way the argument goes so
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:11.480]  we you know conservatives and anti establishment folks
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:14.920]  have to understand we've got to have people that frame the debate
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:18.920]  and and own the you know why should it be that paul ryan should be eligible to
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:22.120]  be nominated but that's outrageous but that's what they're floating
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:25.800]  and so we've got to figure out how to be an aggressive on the front end of that
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.000]  and i think that's the first part by the way the nuclear option
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.040]  and i don't know if this was talked about i know roger stone and i wrote a
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.880]  column a few weeks ago the nuclear option that's that's out there
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.160]  it'll take the party down to the ground but i believe that the establishment
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:44.520]  will ultimately do it is to decide that no delegates are bound
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:49.720]  you see until 1976 delegates were not bound except by the pressure of politics
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:53.880]  and in 1976 jerald ford was afraid that the delegates who were going to the
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:57.960]  convention were being persuaded by reagan and so they made them bound
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:02.200]  by 1979 they 80 they unbound them and there's an argument that could be made
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.600]  that delegates are free to vote their conscience
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:08.680]  imagine if they get to the convention and there's a big hullabaloo over the fact
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:12.840]  that democrats voted in our primaries and people are swaying our election
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:16.920]  with outside money and we should let the delegates vote their conscience
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:20.200]  if they do that they'll all vote their conscience and i think they'll steal
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:24.200]  the the nomination i think those are the kinds of options that could happen
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:28.040]  now i wanted to ask you about mit romney because of course a few weeks ago he
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:31.640]  appeared out of nowhere he started attacking donald trump
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:36.120]  he gave this ridiculous speech which basically fell flat on its face it
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:39.240]  looked like it completely backlashed against him
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:43.000]  but there were rumors a few weeks ago that he would enter the race even at this
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.600]  late stage just to try and take it away from trump do you think he
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:51.000]  still will at this stage enter the race at any point
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.600]  well no listen i mean there are only a handful of candidates
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:58.120]  who are nationally vetted that would be sort of
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:02.680]  able to run for president i mean you know the fact is that you have to have gone
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:06.280]  through the meat grinder at a high level to be able to do this you know in
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:09.880]  terms of your background and and vetting and a few of them are names we
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:13.640]  know you know ron paul is one uh rick perry is one
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.040]  scott walker is one certainly romney is the one i think romney though eliminated
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:21.800]  himself from any future political career of any kind i mean i think
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:25.800]  his speech was so dumb i mean the good news is
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:29.400]  the establishment is not only greedy and lazy
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:32.440]  they're dumb i mean it was a dumb speech if he had wanted to
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:35.800]  to hurt trump he should have you know given a speech that was
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:39.800]  less dramatic and more sort of you know you'll still saw as you
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:42.760]  eat an elephant one bite at a time you know you don't eat an elephant all at
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:45.800]  once and what i what i think romney did there was
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:50.040]  self-indulgent and selfish and silly but whoever put him up to it and
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:53.160]  allowed him to do it eliminated him he will not be the nominee there's no
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:56.840]  chance his career is over his his uh political life is
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:01.240]  ended uh and you know i think we can eliminate him so now we're back down to
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.200]  only if the establishment goes to the outside
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:07.800]  they've got paul ryan they've got scott walker they've got a few others
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:11.240]  and uh but i think mit romney's career is over it was so
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:15.480]  poorly done and so silly and so i mean it really was um
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:19.160]  a kind of a hateful kind of conduct to do that
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:22.120]  in the way he did it and of course by the time he was finished speaking
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:25.720]  they were showing the clip of romney saying nice things about trump and
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:28.600]  and uh how he appreciated his great success and
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:35.960]  it just made romney look like a fool now this brokered convention if
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:40.440]  if they pick someone over trump if they use it to oust trump if they hand pick
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:45.320]  a GOP establishment candidate on vast numbers of
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:49.640]  trump supporters going to protest against that by not voting for him isn't
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:53.560]  this just handing the election to hillary clinton
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:58.760]  of course of course but i recall well uh a wall street uh wall street financer
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:01.560]  quoted um you know anonymously of course who said
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:04.760]  we'll take hillary or jeb we just can't have anybody
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:08.280]  you know like rand or anybody who's totally outside the norm
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:12.920]  i mean as i've said to people for for a year i was in the rnc i was on the team
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:17.240]  i saw it up close um the the fact is that they have about 10 ways
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:20.440]  that they can force a guy like trump that can beat him
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:23.880]  and and they've done this to cruise too but it but certainly trump uh
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:26.840]  and they've tried about seven of them and they the seven haven't worked and
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:29.560]  it's really annoying to these powers but they can't believe it usually when you
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:33.240]  make a gap like uh trump made they're able to force the press covers it you
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:36.040]  get eliminated uh and you know that this is the uh
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:38.680]  you know the fred thompson or whoever you know think about these guys that were
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:41.480]  flashers in the pan and went away in this case
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:45.960]  uh trump is is hanging there but they have 10 ways and they haven't tried eight
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:49.720]  nine and ten and you know nine is to steal it at the convention
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:53.720]  and ten is to take the party down and they will not give up this is that this
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:57.640]  is an old-fashioned racket uh they're running a racket the guy's in power
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:00.680]  it's money it's power it's prestige and they
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:04.680]  will lose their life and their lifestyle if the racket is broken up
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:07.720]  so before they allow that to happen they will take down the party
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:11.240]  and they will let hillary or bernie or anybody else win they don't care about
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:14.360]  the country or the party they care about their own racket
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:17.640]  and that's what they'll do and so i think you know people need to be aware
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:21.960]  don't be surprised um the other thing i'll tell you about joseph i i think
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:25.480]  people don't understand is they won't try to announce that they're taking the
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:28.440]  the nomination away they will start what i call
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:33.000]  dumpster fires they'll have a fight in the platform committee over
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.480]  marriage and over on international policy and then they'll have a fight in
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:40.760]  rules over the future of the republican party
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:44.280]  and the convention and then in the credentials they'll have a fight over
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:47.480]  you know whether we should honor the people who had one or two delegates
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:52.040]  they'll start a series of dumpster fires to create so much anger and hate and
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:55.080]  resentment amongst the candidates uh and and the
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:57.960]  proponents of the candidates you know the delegates for them
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:01.560]  that they'll they'll shoot for what i call the 1880 solution
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:05.480]  in 1880 three three guys came to the republican convention
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:09.960]  and they were um they were they hated each other by the time the 34 ballots were
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:13.560]  over so much they just hated each other there was fist fights at all
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:16.440]  that they went outside the convention to nominate someone so
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:20.120]  the danger is not just that uh someone else steals it
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:25.160]  it's that people get distracted by other fights and other chaos and other
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:28.680]  you know they'll they advertise in a riot gear you know they're now saying if
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:31.400]  the trump people are disenfranchised they'll be riot
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:37.960]  this is all meant to create uh acrimony and chaos to try to cause problems
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:41.880]  okay we're coming up on the break now but ed martin will stay with us i also

[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:17.400]  and i'm talking to ed martin he's the president of phyllis
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:21.720]  schlafly's eagle forum it's eagle forum.org
[02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:25.960]  now ed let's just say that you know trump gets the delegates or he comes out on
[02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:29.800]  top of this broken convention according to the polls
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:33.640]  trump trails hillary in a hypothetical runoff by
[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:37.800]  around six points at this stage cruises slightly ahead of her
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:43.080]  rubio's four points ahead of her first of all what explains that deficit when it
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:47.640]  comes to trump versus clinton and what tactics must trump adopt
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:53.320]  to defeat hillary if he becomes a nominee well you know i often tell people
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:57.800]  that you know phyllis schlafly the organization that i had in her career
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:01.400]  she's always been involved in politics and republican party politics she just
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:04.840]  thinks often you hear phyllis give a speech she'll say politics is where the
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:09.480]  action is and phyllis schlafly lost twice for congress and i lost
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:13.000]  a race for congress and a race for attorney general in missouri where i live
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.760]  and you learn a lot when you run a race now one of the things you learn is that
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:20.360]  the primaries very different than the general and especially
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:24.840]  you get defined after the primaries over and you define yourself and your
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:27.160]  opponent and here's what i would say at this point
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:30.040]  uh four years ago we would have had mit romney and people would have been saying
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:33.400]  things like obama's a failed president and mit romney's a very
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:36.440]  you know honest guy or whatever how are you phrased that i mean now he's so
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:39.240]  shown himself to be sort of uh i think very um
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:44.600]  un uncharitable is a nice way to say it and not very not very good for us but
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:47.800]  um they defined him immediately after the primary as a
[02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:51.640]  a greedy oligarch and a heartless guy and all this stuff and the media
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:55.080]  participated with the democrats so i often caution people
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:59.000]  um you know marco rubio to me he would be easily defined by the media and the
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.280]  democrats as a very light and uh sort of an empty
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:05.880]  suit and and they would make fun of him and they'd make him kind of look like
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:08.200]  uh a lightweight i think that's just the political
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:11.880]  fact of life he can give nice speeches and be uh charming at all
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:15.320]  and i think ted cruise um and and donald trump they
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:19.080]  will face a similar challenge the difference is donald trump is known
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:23.240]  100 percent uh almost nationwide he's defined as a
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:26.520]  sort of leading businessman and uh and kind of the
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.280]  the apprentice guy and and ted cruise even though he's more well known
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:34.440]  is mostly well known by republicans i suspect ted cruise would be defined as a
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:38.040]  hard right you know nasty guy is what they would do to him and i think those
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:41.080]  numbers would change i just go by what i know
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:45.720]  from politics right now we have to look at how hard it is to win the
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:49.160]  nominee excuse me win the election in america for republican
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.200]  you have to thread the electoral college needle
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:55.080]  in large part because ted kennedy and the democrats have
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:58.600]  have transformed the country by illegal illegal immigration and
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:02.120]  and growing dependency of voters on government but we have to thread the
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:04.680]  needle and i think one of the strengths of trump
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:09.400]  is that he is attracting a whole bunch of folks i know the mic group in new jersey
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:12.600]  i know a whole bunch of guys that are cops and work in new york
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:16.040]  they like trump and he's growing now i think there's an attraction and i
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:19.480]  don't get me wrong i think cruise uh can also attract some of them
[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:22.760]  uh but i think trump is those numbers i don't buy them and i think look at
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:25.880]  hillary's the best candidate we can face because she is
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:32.600]  so well known as a corrupt unpleasant person uh and she's also captive to
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:35.880]  wall street in the big interest in the multinational i do think the one
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:38.760]  missing story and i didn't get to listen to the whole show today
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:42.200]  the missing story that's not yet her uh permeated
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:45.720]  into the general consciousness is these globalists
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:49.880]  who are meeting off the shores of of georgia you know phyllis laffley wrote
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:53.720]  about the bill de berg she defy she used a bill de berg term the first time
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:58.920]  in the 1960s she wrote about it but they started this in the 50s 57 56
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:03.720]  it's globalists who want to subvert the nation to an internationalist vision
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:07.160]  and it's destroying the world and certainly destroying america and that's
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:11.880]  that's another part of what's at stake now i talked about this earlier on the
[02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:15.720]  show but i wanted to ask you about it there's this huge fish in our within
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:19.640]  the conservative movement especially in terms of media
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:24.680]  over donald trump we've got glenn beck lashing out at matt drudge because he
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:28.360]  put up a photoshopped image of uh marco rubio
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:31.880]  on the other hand we you know we've got websites like brightbot which have seen
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:35.720]  their traffic spike since they you know semi-induced trump even though
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:39.560]  they say they haven't while the blaze glenn beck's website of course he is
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:42.760]  endorsed head cruise that has been plummeting
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:46.680]  do you understand the concerns expressed by some on the right that trump is
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:51.800]  you know not a true conservative or do you think they're making a huge mistake
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:56.840]  and that people like glenn beck are just acting out of their own vindictiveness
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:01.080]  basically well i think that every election
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:05.640]  is a choice and every election is uh at the at the heart of it you have to make
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:09.080]  a choice and you look at someone and what they stand for
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.600]  you know what phyllis schlafly has said about donald trump
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:15.960]  is that before he was running all the candidates
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:20.600]  wanted to talk about tax cuts and the military and different things
[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:25.880]  and trump drove the point to trade and how the international trade deals are
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:28.600]  destroying america and how damaging they are
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:32.680]  and immigration how illegal immigration and immigration legally
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:36.520]  is transforming the country without donald trump i don't believe
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:39.800]  that the candidates would be talking like that and i think it's a little bit
[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:44.360]  like the 1970s late 1970s ronald reagan
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:48.200]  was certainly a great concern okay i'm not thought we'll be back after right
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:51.720]  with ed martin stay tuned empires on the run
[02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:56.440]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:02.360]  glenn beck opened his radio show today going off on what the hell has happened
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:05.320]  to matt drudge the conservative radio host was spurred
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:08.920]  on this morning by drudge photoshopping rubio as a midget
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:12.920]  after he didn't win a single state last night beck said ever since drudge started
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:16.280]  hanging out with alex jones he's gone to this weird conspiratorial
[02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:20.040]  place where he can't even trust any news coming from him anymore
[02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:22.680]  well no one really likes you beck so get over it
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:26.440]  fox news reports little marco rubio to suspend campaign
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:29.960]  and take on a full-time job at a phone party in miami now i'm just playing but
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:32.920]  ted cruise better not tweet that link there's an article up by truce revolt
[02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:37.160]  ongoing will he or won't he drama has fox news reporting today that his big
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:41.000]  donors are pressuring marco rubio to drop out of the race immediately when cnn
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.760]  aired a similar report two days ago the drama was high as rubio's communications
[02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:47.400]  manager stormed cnn to set the record straight the
[02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:51.320]  discandidate was not even entertaining the notion and three hours ago fox news
[02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:55.160]  aired a very similar report and earlier today cbs did the same
[02:30:55.160 --> 02:30:59.560]  stay tuned for more reports info wars dot com i'm joe biggs brain force it's

[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:25.240]  forum dot org just got cut off by the break there ed but you get into this
[02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:29.000]  fissure within the media particularly the conservative media
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.320]  the debate of whether donald trump is a true conservative just finalize your
[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:37.080]  comments on that yeah real quickly thank you i i think um
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:40.280]  you know i i'm i'm often harkening back to ronald reagan
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:42.680]  up on when phyllis and others talk about reagan
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:46.120]  um people weren't worried about some of reagan's positions because
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:50.360]  nancy reagan rest her soul was liberal and uh you know pretty liberal lady and
[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:53.800]  and reagan ended up doing some liberal things but on the big question
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:34:00.440]  in 1978 79 people knew reagan understood that communism was evil and the soviets
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:05.080]  were the enemy and he was a strong macho charismatic guy and he carried the day
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:08.600]  well i would submit to you today that there was only a few candidates and
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:12.200]  ted cruises one who's done pretty good and trump is one that's led the way
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:16.280]  on the fundamental issue of whether america will be a sovereign nation
[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:20.920]  that is our trade deals illegal immigration uh trump has led the way
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:23.720]  and i think on some of the other issues i'd like to
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:27.960]  know for sure where he'll be but i think on judges for example when he talks
[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:31.240]  about clarence thomas as a model clarence thomas is one of my
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:33.800]  favorite people in public life i think that's good right so
[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:37.160]  but on the big question uh i think it's a it's a big
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:40.200]  you know it's kind of a starting point and so the media can't stand it by the
[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:42.520]  way and the reason the media can't stand it is because
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:46.200]  the media and the multinationalist globalist corporations
[02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:49.320]  have to have these trade deals to make their money
[02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:52.280]  and they have to have illegal immigration and open borders and it's so
[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:55.720]  it's they have they have to resist it and that's why they're all fading and
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:59.320]  even fox news is lacking in credibility and not even but
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:03.160]  certainly more day by day because of their being in the tank for the
[02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:08.200]  globalist vision of uh of open borders and uh and trade deals that got america
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:11.400]  so i i i think the definition of conservative
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:17.800]  is someone who puts the americans first not the globalists or wall street or
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:20.840]  anything else and if you put americans first
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:25.240]  you're gonna address the first threat and the first threat is these um
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:31.000]  these huge losses of sovereignty now another issue i wanted to delve into
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.520]  because this is something that i cover on a weekly basis now
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:39.080]  these threats against trump we know that trump now wears a bulletproof vest to
[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:42.520]  most of his his events he's under secret service protection
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:46.120]  we have reports that you know al chapo was targeting him
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:49.400]  every single day on twitter you have these death threats
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:53.240]  there was an egyptian guy who basically just had to agree to be deported
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:56.600]  because of a direct death threat he made to trump on facebook
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:35:59.720]  we've got frothing from the liberals about how they're gonna
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:04.840]  leave america if trump becomes president completely unhinged maniacal reaction
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:09.560]  we've got these crazies crashing trump events every time he gives a speech
[02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:13.560]  i mean i'm concerned for donald trump safety not as some part of
[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:16.840]  dark conspiracy where the gop establishment would take him out
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:21.320]  but just the sheer amount of crazies and the vitriol being directed against him
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:27.240]  are you concerned for donald trump safety uh yeah i i would say i'm concerned
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:31.800]  for uh trump safety and for uh cruises too and for and for a number of these
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:35.720]  guys but i want to point to the to the the culprit here the culprit is
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:39.560]  a leftist culture that has decided that whether it's
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:44.280]  black lives matter or i'm from st louis uh and we had ferguson it was a totally
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:49.000]  trumped up engineered effort by uh by soros funded
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.800]  groups i mean what they're doing is they're conditioning people to recognize
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:58.040]  their frustration and then to act in terrible ways
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:01.080]  and i really think that this is a danger and again you know this is
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:04.280]  this is uh more where you know you say more information is better and all
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:07.960]  but i think we're starting to see uh when we find out
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:11.000]  that there's a real problem so yeah sure i mean i i'm i'm concerned
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.280]  about violence uh in ways that i don't think we've ever expected
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:18.120]  what's not true is that trump is creating the violence
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:22.040]  or that cruises creating the violence or that somehow the speeches and the talks
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:26.120]  that's not true what is true is the culture and american life
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:30.520]  has become coarser but that's a leftist move and uh and i think we have to be
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:34.040]  careful there again i think i said earlier in the program
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:37.160]  one of the things that the left will do when they're losing
[02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:41.240]  is divert attention through violence and rioting
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:44.840]  and killings and things like that that sometimes they just use them when they
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:48.360]  occur you know there's no doubt that this kid in ferguson was killed
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:51.320]  he died and then they used the situation to say something
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:55.240]  absolutely different from the truth um but um but yeah i'm very worried about it
[02:37:55.240 --> 02:37:58.680]  and i think um i think most people you know i ran for office as head of a
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:02.520]  party here most people that observe politics have seen the edge take up and
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:05.800]  this is where i think obama is not a he's not an honest man
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:11.640]  obama has been a terrible part of degrading how we live and encouraging
[02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:16.280]  people to be so frustrated and shrill and to think that violence is an
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:19.400]  appropriate way to feel it's terrible stuff
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:22.920]  well i mean we had you know time magazine and others after ferguson come out
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:26.120]  and write articles called in defense of looting
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:29.480]  we've got you know black lives matter people chanting
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:32.920]  what do we want dead cops while they're marching in new york city
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:37.640]  we've got the ideological guru who the three founders of black lives matter
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:41.240]  ascribe the whole movement to being a sartre chicor
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:46.520]  who is a convicted cop killer on the fbi's most wanted domestic terrorist list
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:49.960]  so you know we had ishmael brinsley in new york killing the two
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:53.320]  nypd officers as part of a black lives matter avenger attack
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:57.320]  there are these kind of people out there and yeah as you said they're blaming it
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:39:01.320]  on trump claiming he's racist and bigoted when
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:05.400]  he's got more than double the support from muslims in america than any other
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:08.760]  gop candidate in fact all of them put together more than double
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:12.520]  he's got uh he's set to break records for black support
[02:39:12.520 --> 02:39:17.160]  so while this racist bigoted narrative seems to fester on the surface there's
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:22.760]  no real depth to it is there no and and look this is the um
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:26.840]  they want to distract from anything but what is really happening
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:30.840]  what is really happening in this country is a lot of people
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:34.040]  i think it's more than a majority we're going to see over the next six months
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:38.360]  are waking up to the fact not only that the government is corrupt
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:41.880]  and that the people in power in both parties are running a racket
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:45.480]  and people know that but they're waking up to the fact that these
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:49.240]  internationalist efforts corporate and otherwise are
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:53.880]  are really degrading what is america and what is our nation and what who we're
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:57.720]  oh we are so the people are waking up to that now they're going to distract with
[02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:00.040]  violence and i agree with you and it's a false thing
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:03.400]  but that the press and the media won't cover it because donald trump is not
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:07.560]  winning because he's charming or because of stakes or trump
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:11.800]  university he's winning because he's speaking directly to
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:15.400]  what i would call a dramatic change in american
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:20.920]  culture way of living specifically the trade deals and immigration nobody in
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:22.680]  this country i mean when he said i want to
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:26.680]  i want to pause on all muslim immigrants i didn't meet a person that
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:29.400]  thought that sounded out of control or inappropriate
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:32.440]  now i know a bunch of people i'm not saying there are many liberals but i know
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:35.160]  some the media covered that like it was insulting
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:37.400]  you know i did an exit poll in one of the early states
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:41.240]  come in 90 percent of all republicans agreed with the idea of banning muslims
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:44.520]  that's not what trump i think said but my point is only that
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:48.600]  they're so out of touch and what they're trying to do is stoke up violence and
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:52.200]  anger when what's really happening is people i think are getting empowered
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:54.840]  and i think that's what we have to have and by the way it has to extend the
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:59.480]  congress and has to extend to the courts i mean we need everybody to get back
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:03.560]  into the understanding of what we're supposed to be about
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:07.480]  not what they want to become and want to be kings of you know i find the
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:10.280]  supreme court these people think they're in charge of the world
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:14.120]  they have a role in our system and and so i think people are awakening and i
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:17.000]  think that's why you're seeing so much energy
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.440]  okay i think that's a good place to wrap it up ed just tell people how they can
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:24.840]  get involved with eagle forum yeah well the first way is eagle forum

[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:52.440]  eagle forum dot org thanks for joining us ed and we're going to move on now to
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:56.200]  more news before we hit another um info wars report
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:59.960]  info wars message to bernie sanders supporters we've got that coming up
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:03.240]  but this was a top story on info wars dot com this morning
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:08.040]  top danish imam admits a gender for muslims to conquer euro
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:11.880]  again this is not me saying it it's not alex jones saying it
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:15.480]  undercover footage broadcast by a danish tv station shows mohammed food
[02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:19.160]  al-barazi the head imam of the mosque of islamic union in
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:22.360]  denmark which of course has taken in a lot of these
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:25.400]  uh muslim migrants from the middle east and north africa
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:30.280]  admitting that the goal of the migrant influx is for muslims to conquer euro
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:34.280]  so he basically said quote right now we are in a time when we are opening
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:37.960]  these countries they spoke to islamic experts
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:40.680]  professors tina megard and professor thomas hoffman
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:43.800]  who agreed that the islamist understanding of the word open
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:49.240]  means to conquer the imam also basically said that muslims arriving in the west
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:52.440]  shouldn't be expected in fact shouldn't full stop
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:57.800]  integrate into western society quote when i came to this country 23 years ago
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:02.120]  we were only 55 000 muslims now we are 300 000
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:05.240]  hence the conclusion of this talk is that it's possible to live in this
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:08.520]  country without melting in you must understand the
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:12.280]  conditions without melting into society so this top
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:16.040]  imam in denmark with this undercover footage basically admits that
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:20.920]  yes this wave of muslim migrants is to conquer europe and in fact if you look
[02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:23.480]  in the quran and it's quoted in this article
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:30.600]  the concept of hijra or jihad by emigration is celebrated in the quran
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:33.960]  so it's no surprise to see these top imams calling
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:37.720]  for exactly that calling for muslims to emigrate to the west
[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:41.880]  to spread the religion of islam now of course got no problem with them having
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:45.800]  their own religious beliefs it's when they're imposed on others
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:49.480]  that it becomes a problem that is the heart of islamism
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:53.000]  we've previously featured a video which is in this article
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:56.680]  from another imam who gave a speech at a mosque in jerusalem
[02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:01.000]  basically said europe is decrepit they have no fertility
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:05.480]  we need to go to europe we can conquer europe by breeding them out
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:11.160]  again not me saying that not alex jones one of the top imams in jerusalem
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:15.240]  and it's no surprise that you know they're being welcomed in given what
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:19.240]  green party politician stefanie von berg said in front of the german
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:23.080]  parliament and we featured this quote before because it's absolutely
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:27.400]  shocking she said quote our society will change our city will be radically
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:32.280]  changed i hold it in 2030 years there will no longer be german majority in our
[02:44:32.280 --> 02:44:36.120]  city i want to make it very clear especially
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:40.200]  towards those right wingers this is a good thing
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:43.640]  so she's basically saying that muslim migrants will
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:48.280]  become a majority in german cities they will replace
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:53.880]  the native german population and that that is a good thing
[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:58.520]  which is unsurprising the consequence of that this is out of afp
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:01.720]  rising fortunes of right wing populists in europe
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:05.480]  a wave of right wing populism has swept across europe in recent months as the
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:09.400]  continent struggles with its biggest refugee crisis since world war two
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:13.960]  now the problem here of course is that many of these populist parties which
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:17.960]  have been growing in support for the past couple of years now
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:21.080]  i mean there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that but
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:25.560]  some of them are actually fascist parties so again the point i've made over
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:29.000]  and over again classical liberals refusal to stand up for
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.680]  liberal beliefs has created this vacuum where people's
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:35.960]  they're not being represented their concerns aren't being represented
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:40.520]  their voices are being censored simply for expressing concern about the pace of
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:45.400]  this migrant invasion that vacuum has created a space
[02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:49.240]  where extremists have flooded in so now you're getting extremist parties
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:51.880]  being elected in europe and that's going to be a problem going forward
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:55.560]  we're going to go to this video now info was messaged to bernie sander
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:58.360]  supporters the establishment knows what's at stake
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:02.440]  do you here's the clip i've seen signs that several businesses throughout
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:06.600]  austin who were scotch supporters ron paul four years ago now with bernie
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:11.800]  sander signs to many it may not make sense because they are polar opposites
[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:16.520]  ideologically but there is some common ground both ron paul and bernie
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:20.040]  sanders followed their principles consistently over decades of public
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:24.600]  office in a word authentic you know what these guys are
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:27.320]  about both ron paul and bernie sanders had a
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:31.240]  long association with the mainstream political party that they were never
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:34.360]  really a part of they were never part of the club
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:38.040]  never part of the establishment that's why the establishment hates them
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:42.200]  is why we identify with them we're not in that club either
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:45.800]  and the supporters of both of these men speak of the movement behind their
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:50.120]  candidates as a revolution but the system is obdurate
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:53.560]  it hates change the establishment of both parties
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:57.400]  each has its own ways of controlling access to power
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:00.920]  an article today on the dredger port speaks of the undemocratic democrat
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:04.840]  party rules at issue are the super delegates the super
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:08.680]  heroes of the party current office holders former office
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:13.800]  holders party apparatchiks and lobbyists in fact
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.400]  one out of seven 14 percent of the super delegates
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:21.160]  are lobbyists or former lobbyists bernie sanders
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:26.440]  started out as a 450 delegate underdog hillary was one sixth of the way to the
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:29.480]  finish line before the first vote was cast
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:34.280]  so far seven million people have voted but 473 people
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:38.040]  that none of us know account for 42 percent of the delegates
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:42.280]  so far and last night's michigan election hillary lost but got more
[02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:46.120]  delegates both parties are dishonest and oppressive
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:49.640]  the political parties should be abolished or replaced with new parties
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:53.160]  but with the rules currently in place the best we can hope for
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:56.760]  is a hostile takeover a hostile takeover is easier
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:01.080]  under the rules of the republican party as nate silver of 538 pointed out
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:04.760]  the rules of the republican party are not as restrictive as the democrat
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:07.880]  party's rules and it helps if you have a billionaire who
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:11.640]  doesn't need the money of the multinational corporate donors
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:15.320]  donald trump doesn't have the grandfatherly demeanor of ron paul or
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:19.080]  bernie sanders but as gruff as he may be he's not dependent on
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.440]  establishment donors and he's willing to fight and there's some
[02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:26.040]  commonality between trump bernie sanders and ron paul
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:29.560]  like bernie and ron trump has also stood consistently
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:33.000]  and alone against the establishment for decades
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.840]  trump stan has been in opposition to unfair trade that is taking our jobs
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:41.720]  and destroying our economy 35 years ago he paid a hundred thousand dollars
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:45.080]  for an ad in the new york times to oppose the trade and war
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:49.080]  policies of the multinational corporations the globalists
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:53.000]  he has opposed the republican orthodoxy of so-called free trade
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:57.560]  and of being the world's policemen and he has set it to their face
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:01.320]  he's called for ending NAFTA for auditing the fed for releasing the secret
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:06.360]  28 pages of the 9-11 report he will stop TPP and PTIP
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:12.120]  and stop the exporting of jobs neocons and those who want to provoke wars for
[02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:15.560]  profit for the military industrial complex are his biggest critics
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:19.800]  for all his bluster he has long criticized american militarism

[03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:13.800]  is what we've been saying for years about the agency and i want to cover a
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:18.040]  lot of articles some cases of why it's got to this point
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:21.640]  and uh and then talk about the money that cps gets
[03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:26.040]  when they get children and put them into foster care because that is their main
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:29.800]  mission is to keep money coming into the system and the case
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:33.080]  of course the texas case workers are they're complaining about the
[03:01:33.080 --> 03:01:37.080]  the big caseloads well that's because it's a money making operation so they're
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:41.800]  really not interested in quality it's quantity quantity so they're up in arms
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:45.560]  about it they don't want to lose their jobs i heard about this uh come
[03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:50.120]  driving in today as an npr reporter who was just couldn't believe this judge
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:54.040]  wanted to do an investigation and and rebuild cps i mean
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:57.240]  just the the cases that i've heard about we covered one
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:02:02.440]  of a little girl a two-year-old girl a few years ago up in round rock
[03:02:02.440 --> 03:02:06.120]  her somebody snitched on him said they they saw him smoking marijuana or
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:08.760]  smelled it they came took their little girl away
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:12.680]  brought her to this monster who then beat her to death a two-year-old girl
[03:02:12.680 --> 03:02:15.880]  and i'm going to show you the photos of this little girl beautiful little girl
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:20.360]  snuffed out because of greedy child kidnappers
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:23.480]  that's what they are cps is child kidnapping at its finest
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:27.080]  and i'm sure there's some good people in cps who do a good job
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:31.400]  but their main mission is to bring in more money i don't think it's to help
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:34.280]  these little kids and then when they get them in their care they feed them with
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:37.000]  drugs all kind of stuff i'm going to get more into that
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:40.840]  also when we get back um and now appears that the fbi is going to be
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:44.440]  investigated in the shooting of levoy finnecombe which i think it's a
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:48.360]  murder personally and um we're going to play a
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:51.560]  report that david knight and joe biggs filed a couple days ago
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:56.360]  on that subject and uh we're going to and then i've got a weird story
[03:02:56.360 --> 03:02:59.400]  of the guy it was i think he was a former marine
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:03.400]  who shot the idaho pastor who was a ted crew supporter
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:07.880]  well you're not going to believe what this guy thinks what he posted on his
[03:03:07.880 --> 03:03:11.640]  facebook page but here's one of the articles idaho pastor shot day after
[03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:15.880]  praying at ted cruise rally he was shot by a marine who they just
[03:03:15.880 --> 03:03:20.680]  picked up recently in uh dc he was on the fence of the white
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:23.880]  house and you're not going to be trying to protect
[03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:27.800]  barack obama actually so it gets weirder from there let me
[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:32.280]  tell you what this is uh a story if you're into david icor anything you'll
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:36.520]  you'll definitely um kind of i guess relate to what this guy is coming from
[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:39.160]  yeah manhunt underway well they've caught the guy now
[03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:42.840]  and uh the news report that i'm going to play is just going to blow your mind i'm
[03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:47.960]  also going to take your phone calls 800 259 9231 start calling in

[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:56.920]  and i'm also going to play a little bit of a clip from last night from our
[03:03:56.920 --> 03:04:00.920]  debate coverage obviously the democratic debate is not
[03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:04.680]  as popular with our audiences covering the republican debates but we felt
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:07.640]  we ought to cover at least one of them i think this is our second
[03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:10.840]  coverage of the debate we hadn't done one since i think jim webb
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:14.600]  had been in the race when it was a three person race now it's just a dog and
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:18.440]  pony show between two wolves fighting over uh making government
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:21.960]  bigger making you pay for it so we're going to get into all that once again
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:26.440]  the number to call in is 800 259 9231 one of the
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:29.320]  interesting things we did last night during that live debate coverage is take
[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:33.400]  live skype phone calls we had several people call in so that was really
[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:36.360]  interesting we're trying to do things you know make things
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:40.440]  more interactive and get more people to let you know

[03:05:01.640 --> 03:05:05.560]  recently sco a subdivision of the u.s military with ties to darpa
[03:05:05.560 --> 03:05:10.520]  released a video of micro drones being launched from an f-16 fighter at 430
[03:05:10.520 --> 03:05:13.320]  miles per hour the washington post article titled

[03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:21.320]  and drone swarms the announcement also represents another step toward total
[03:05:21.320 --> 03:05:25.000]  autonomous military robotics a technology that top experts such as
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:28.600]  elon musk and max tegmark have been warning scientists to think twice
[03:05:28.600 --> 03:05:30.920]  about seo also said in the same announcement they
[03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:34.520]  have successfully developed and tested avatar flight technology
[03:05:34.520 --> 03:05:38.200]  our new project not previously reported is called avatar and calls for the
[03:05:38.200 --> 03:05:41.480]  pentagon to pair high-tech fifth generation fighter jets with
[03:05:41.480 --> 03:05:44.840]  unmanned versions of older jets which will be flown without a pilot for the
[03:05:44.840 --> 03:05:47.960]  first time imagine this technology in the hands of the
[03:05:47.960 --> 03:05:51.400]  same government that was also forced to admit this week that it had been using
[03:05:51.400 --> 03:05:54.200]  domestic drones for domestic surveillance operations

[03:07:58.360 --> 03:08:08.360]  you
[03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:25.000]  well apparently it's okay to joke about the assassination of presidential
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:29.800]  candidate donald trump as paul joseph watson alluded to earlier
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:33.320]  here's the article he's talking about that he wrote vice editor jokes about
[03:08:33.320 --> 03:08:36.840]  trump assassination to save america from fascism
[03:08:36.840 --> 03:08:40.440]  vice contributing editor and left-wing activist molly crabapple has become the
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:43.320]  latest public figure to joke about wanting to see donald trump
[03:08:43.320 --> 03:08:47.320]  assassinated uh she tweeted out
[03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:50.840]  the you know there's like a twitter thing going on she's like i'm imagining
[03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:53.720]  them as stone cold operatives about to assassinate trump who are also
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:56.920]  adorably in love she followed up with another tweet glorifying the would be
[03:08:56.920 --> 03:08:59.800]  assassins a handsome married couple who are also
[03:08:59.800 --> 03:09:04.200]  assassins taking um who tasked with saving america from fascism
[03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:08.120]  well she was really left-wing she wouldn't have said handsome married couple
[03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:13.240]  she would have said something like uh body body amorphous whatever who knows
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:18.280]  what those those people are into but i want to play a couple videos real quick
[03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:22.520]  and the big story with donald trump the last night we showed this he got 39
[03:09:22.520 --> 03:09:27.000]  percent of the muslim or the people in dearborn michigan who are a majority of
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:30.680]  the people there are muslim so people want to say he's racist
[03:09:30.680 --> 03:09:34.200]  and he hates muslims and he's xenophobic well why are muslims voting for him
[03:09:34.200 --> 03:09:38.200]  why are hispanics voting for him because they believe in what he's saying
[03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:42.680]  and uh so let's go to the cnn um donald trump voter turnout biggest story in
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:47.960]  politics the democrats are down 30 35 percent
[03:09:47.960 --> 03:09:52.840]  they're down from what they were we're up by 50 percent and even more than that
[03:09:52.840 --> 03:09:56.040]  you're talking about millions of people so i actually think it's the biggest
[03:09:56.040 --> 03:10:00.360]  story in politics today and i hope that the republicans will embrace it
[03:10:00.360 --> 03:10:04.040]  we have don't forget we have democrats coming over
[03:10:04.040 --> 03:10:07.800]  very importantly we have independents coming over
[03:10:07.800 --> 03:10:11.880]  and they haven't done that ever probably ever and with all of these people
[03:10:11.880 --> 03:10:14.920]  coming over we're gonna have something very very special
[03:10:14.920 --> 03:10:19.880]  if i win and if i get to go against hillary polls is showing that i beat her
[03:10:19.880 --> 03:10:22.920]  and some of the polls have been beating her very easily because when you take
[03:10:22.920 --> 03:10:26.520]  advantage we will take many many people away from the democrats and we'll take
[03:10:26.520 --> 03:10:30.040]  many many people away that normally go democrat
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:34.520]  as independents and we're seeing that we're seeing that we had people come
[03:10:34.520 --> 03:10:38.520]  over here who have never voted republican who have never even thought
[03:10:38.520 --> 03:10:42.040]  about it and they came and they voted republican and i'll tell you another
[03:10:42.040 --> 03:10:46.120]  group of people that i've seen and i'll be signing autographs after a speech
[03:10:46.120 --> 03:10:50.760]  and we'll be talking to people and i've had many many people say
[03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:53.560]  and it was a beautiful thing to hear it mr trump
[03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:58.600]  i'm 67 years old many people i'm 67 years old
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:03.000]  i've never ever voted before i've never come close
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:07.560]  to voting before this is the first time i'll ever vote
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:12.760]  and that's so amazing it's so amazing yeah he's definitely woken up the sleeping
[03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:15.240]  giant whether you agree with his policies or not
[03:11:15.240 --> 03:11:18.840]  his rhetoric his barnstorming is really waking
[03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:21.880]  woken up a lot of people and gotten them gotten them to vote there was another
[03:11:21.880 --> 03:11:25.800]  story i read about that guy who had a donald trump sign in his yard
[03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:29.560]  and uh three hispanic youths came over and pulled it out
[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:32.920]  and uh he said you're gonna put that back and uh they pulled a gun on him and
[03:11:32.920 --> 03:11:35.800]  then his neighbor ran into his house and came out with a gun and said i got
[03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:38.840]  your back bro and those guys back down and
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:41.800]  left without an incident happening but that's just another
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:45.480]  um yeah there it is hispanic gang members arrested after crumpling
[03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:49.480]  trump yard sign and pulling gun on trump supporter i think one of them was a
[03:11:49.480 --> 03:11:52.840]  teenager and two of them were adults so either 18 or over
[03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:57.400]  um i just watched the video of the guy and he's like y'all gonna put that back
[03:11:57.400 --> 03:12:01.560]  you know i thought it was funny and now but this is what ted cruise thinks of
[03:12:01.560 --> 03:12:04.360]  trump supporters he doesn't think too much about them he's not really
[03:12:04.360 --> 03:12:07.000]  interested in what they have to say doesn't think they have much substance
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:11.080]  here it is from his mouth and so what is happening listen
[03:12:11.080 --> 03:12:16.360]  donald does well with voters who have relatively low information who are not
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:20.360]  that engaged and who are angry and they see him as an angry voice
[03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:24.600]  where we are beating him is when voters get more engaged and they get more
[03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:28.760]  informed when they inform themselves they realize his record
[03:12:28.760 --> 03:12:32.440]  he's what they're angry at he is the corruption and if you want
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:37.560]  someone to stand up to washington the only one who has been doing so in this
[03:12:37.560 --> 03:12:41.320]  race is me yeah he will stand up to washington
[03:12:41.320 --> 03:12:45.000]  right by his side he's going to have golden sacks right there
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:48.120]  leading the way paving the way you know he's going to push a bunch of trade
[03:12:48.120 --> 03:12:50.760]  deals through a bunch of globalist trade deals
[03:12:50.760 --> 03:12:53.400]  that is what you're going to get with ted cruise unfortunately that's the way it
[03:12:53.400 --> 03:12:57.480]  is and now he signed on with the bushes what do you think that means
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:00.520]  the writings on the wall he's going to pick bushes is running mate
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:03.880]  i mean if you can't see it i'm sorry that's how it's going to be
[03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:07.720]  and you know what happens when bushes become vice presidents
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:11.960]  you know what happens so let's look at this article now fbi agents under
[03:13:11.960 --> 03:13:15.240]  criminal investigation in lavoix fennecum shooting
[03:13:15.240 --> 03:13:18.760]  now a second video has come out it's a cell phone video and we're going to
[03:13:18.760 --> 03:13:22.920]  show you that in a second from a report but it turns out
[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:26.840]  however officials announced that one fbi agent suspected of lying about firing
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:30.680]  twice at fennecum and he's got four other agents suspected
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:33.720]  and helping him cover up that lie and they were hiding the bullets and just
[03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:37.240]  not reporting the shots i mean that's a big deal
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:40.840]  these guys they released that video that drone shot
[03:13:40.840 --> 03:13:44.600]  and they were like huh see who's going for his gun well and then some of the
[03:13:44.600 --> 03:13:49.480]  the protesters came out and said that gun was stolen that wasn't his gun
[03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:53.240]  and then it looks like well he was fired upon and killed by uh it looks like a
[03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:57.240]  long rifle now and it wasn't the handguns that killed him so he was
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:14:00.840]  there was multiple people in multiple positions that was an ambush setup
[03:14:00.840 --> 03:14:05.160]  another local sheriff in oregon called it a ambush
[03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:09.560]  so let's go to that report right now from david david knight and joe biggs
[03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:13.480]  joe biggs here with info wars dot com now david and i just
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:17.640]  saw the shocking footage released by the oregonian
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:21.480]  right after they've already come out and said that lavoix fennecum's
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:25.160]  murder was justified now we have raw cell phone footage
[03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:31.320]  from shawna cox inside the vehicle that proves that they were shooting at them
[03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:34.680]  beforehand completely going against the actual narrative of the story
[03:14:34.680 --> 03:14:37.240]  that the feds came out within the first place i mean what are your first thoughts
[03:14:37.240 --> 03:14:40.040]  on seeing this video you know it was really heart-wrenching
[03:14:40.040 --> 03:14:43.800]  to look at this i i gotta say what i saw there was murder
[03:14:43.800 --> 03:14:47.880]  and attempted murder of three other people in the vehicle
[03:14:47.880 --> 03:14:59.080]  hey you can see what's happening and the way the
[03:14:59.080 --> 03:15:02.360]  the video is set up and and again it was put up on the oregonian site but it was
[03:15:02.360 --> 03:15:06.040]  released by the sheriff's department do shane uh is that the way you pronounce
[03:15:06.040 --> 03:15:09.800]  the shoots okay the shoots the county released us they're the ones who are
[03:15:09.800 --> 03:15:13.000]  doing the investigation this comes on the day
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:16.360]  that the law enforcement has told us that the shooting of lavoix fennecum was
[03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:20.200]  justified this flies in the face of that
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:23.720]  this is an outrage that they would put this up there that they would say that
[03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:27.240]  law enforcement is justified how are you justified in shooting a man with his
[03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:30.600]  hands up and you can see that that's what happened here you can see that
[03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:34.120]  they're taking potshots for a very long time at the people who are in the car
[03:15:34.120 --> 03:15:37.400]  and the way this video is set up they superimpose the cell phone footage
[03:15:37.400 --> 03:15:42.200]  from shawna cox who is in the vehicle uh in the backseat with victoria sharp with
[03:15:42.200 --> 03:15:45.560]  ryan bundy uh lavoix lavoix fennecum is driving
[03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:48.360]  okay so she's taking it from the back corner so you can see what's going on
[03:15:48.360 --> 03:15:53.000]  they superimpose that with the footage from the fbi and here's the thing joe
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:56.360]  we've said from the very beginning this footage from the fbi
[03:15:56.360 --> 03:16:00.440]  along with their phony lying narrative was set up to hide
[03:16:00.440 --> 03:16:04.280]  this murder they did a very low resolution aerial footage
[03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:07.640]  without sound so you can't tell what's going on you can't tell when the shots
[03:16:07.640 --> 03:16:11.800]  were fired they've done this from the very beginning this that was a video
[03:16:11.800 --> 03:16:14.760]  that mainstream media went with for a very long time that was a video that
[03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:18.440]  everybody saw now after they say well it's a justified shooting
[03:16:18.440 --> 03:16:22.440]  now you can see what happens you can hear when the shots are fired you can see
[03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:25.480]  that they're shooting them as they're driving up to the barricade
[03:16:25.480 --> 03:16:28.760]  you can see that they're shooting lavoix fennecum as he gets out of the car
[03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:32.360]  with his hands up to take fire away from the rest of the people
[03:16:32.360 --> 03:16:35.880]  in the vehicle he was a hero to take the fire
[03:16:35.880 --> 03:16:39.160]  to uh to sacrifice himself for those people in the car yet
[03:16:39.160 --> 03:16:42.280]  they still tried to shoot the people in the car totally outrageous
[03:16:42.280 --> 03:16:45.160]  yeah and that kind of goes with the entire point that we were trying to make
[03:16:45.160 --> 03:16:47.560]  back when it happened they said that he was reaching for a gun
[03:16:47.560 --> 03:16:51.240]  in fact you hear those shots first as the hands are going up
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:55.240]  so that could possibly be him reaching in pain going oh my god he just got shot
[03:16:55.240 --> 03:16:58.440]  and then they go and they're going in after that and continuing to shoot
[03:16:58.440 --> 03:17:01.960]  now after lavoix dead laying there in the snow they continue to shoot again
[03:17:01.960 --> 03:17:06.600]  that's when ryan bundy takes a shot as well and you can see the glass shatter
[03:17:06.600 --> 03:17:10.120]  and they also continue to fire what seems to be beam backgrounds to break the
[03:17:10.120 --> 03:17:13.160]  glass so they can then shoot in the tear gas they did
[03:17:13.160 --> 03:17:17.400]  and all you can hear is victoria victoria sharp a very young girl scared crying
[03:17:17.400 --> 03:17:21.160]  praying you know the entire conversation leading up to this no one was like i've
[03:17:21.160 --> 03:17:24.040]  got a gun i'm going to make this last stand the guy just said if you're going
[03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:28.200]  to shoot me do it stop wasting my time i'm trying to go meet the uh the
[03:17:28.200 --> 03:17:31.240]  sheriff and grants pass follow us we're on our way to see the sheriff you can
[03:17:31.240 --> 03:17:35.960]  follow us yeah it's absolutely amazing joe and again it was
[03:17:35.960 --> 03:17:39.480]  they did this so that they could hide what they had done and we've had a law
[03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:43.000]  enforcement officer look at this and critique what these people did
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:47.080]  the guy who the two guys who came up appeared to be the ones when he was
[03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:50.360]  still standing there were shots that were being fired at him as he got out of
[03:17:50.360 --> 03:17:53.240]  the vehicle with his hands up then he walks a little bit further out and in
[03:17:53.240 --> 03:17:57.160]  the video that the fbi released you can see one guy coming from where the
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:01.960]  blockade was and he is shooting at lavoix finnecombe and he points out this guy
[03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:07.400]  has exposed himself to hostile fire from the vehicle if in fact there are
[03:18:07.400 --> 03:18:11.080]  dangerous people in there they're treating this guy as if he is a threat to
[03:18:11.080 --> 03:18:14.840]  their lives and yet he's coming out of a vehicle they don't know who's in this
[03:18:14.840 --> 03:18:18.520]  this other vehicle the vehicle has stopped but they feel that they have to
[03:18:18.520 --> 03:18:22.120]  shoot this guy with his hands up okay exposing himself to fire
[03:18:22.120 --> 03:18:25.880]  from the vehicle then they pull back and they shoot at the vehicle
[03:18:25.880 --> 03:18:29.560]  okay so if they were dangerous they could have killed this officer the other
[03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:34.120]  officer who's coming from out of the snow is shooting across at the other
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:38.520]  officers he's this basically a crossfire they've set themselves up in so it's
[03:18:38.520 --> 03:18:42.760]  amazingly incompetent if you look at it from a law enforcement perspective but
[03:18:42.760 --> 03:18:47.000]  it is outright murder and attempted murder if you watch this video it's
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.800]  absolutely outrageous i don't know what else to say i mean it's just one of the
[03:18:49.800 --> 03:18:53.960]  most amazing things that i've seen to superimpose the reality of what's
[03:18:53.960 --> 03:18:58.360]  going on with this line david night has nails around on the head amazingly
[03:18:58.360 --> 03:19:00.520]  incompetent if you look at where those two
[03:19:00.520 --> 03:19:03.720]  shooters are that are on the ground ones right behind the car i've got it up
[03:19:03.720 --> 03:19:06.840]  here you can see it you see him get right behind the car i've got it up on the
[03:19:06.840 --> 03:19:10.200]  screen right here guys and then you have the other one who's firing right into
[03:19:10.200 --> 03:19:13.800]  his other fellow officers who does that nobody does that
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:18.360]  you never fire right into your fellow officers yet he felt justified doing
[03:19:18.360 --> 03:19:21.800]  that this other officers right behind the car
[03:19:21.800 --> 03:19:25.400]  exposing himself to if they're they were worried about shots coming from this
[03:19:25.400 --> 03:19:27.640]  car he didn't care he knew because he knew
[03:19:27.640 --> 03:19:31.320]  that these guys were unarmed he knew that they were peaceful he knew that they
[03:19:31.320 --> 03:19:34.200]  were not going to fire first they were totally
[03:19:34.200 --> 03:19:37.880]  totally involved in the murder of a man who died on his feet
[03:19:37.880 --> 03:19:41.560]  and hopefully he will be remembered and his death will not be in vain
[03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:46.520]  um and we'll be right back with more i mean it's just disturbing to see this

[03:24:23.480 --> 03:24:26.040]  ted cruise rally and then he was shot the day after
[03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:30.040]  and now they finally found this guy at the gates of the white house of all
[03:24:30.040 --> 03:24:32.840]  places but let's go to uncle willy in washington first
[03:24:32.840 --> 03:24:36.200]  wants to talk about trump and cruise go ahead uncle willy
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:40.280]  hey rob how you doing i'm doing great
[03:24:40.280 --> 03:24:44.920]  listen i've been trying to call for about a year so i'm glad i got through
[03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:49.640]  i've been listening for about a year and i absolutely love this this program
[03:24:49.640 --> 03:24:53.000]  um we're not a program we're a show we're not trying to program you in any way
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.480]  shape or form we're trying to give you information so you can make your own
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:58.440]  decisions by the way but go ahead uncle willy
[03:24:58.440 --> 03:25:03.160]  i got you okay um i my wife and i totally support
[03:25:03.160 --> 03:25:07.240]  uh trump for president i think that would be so exciting to finally vote for
[03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:12.760]  somebody that we absolutely believe in um secondly i got three points
[03:25:12.760 --> 03:25:18.520]  secondly if the choice is uh ted cruise we would vote for him but it
[03:25:18.520 --> 03:25:22.120]  would be depending upon who his vice presidential mate
[03:25:22.120 --> 03:25:25.480]  if he's a typical uh establishment republican
[03:25:25.480 --> 03:25:29.320]  we would not vote for ted cruise and the third thing
[03:25:29.320 --> 03:25:33.960]  is i get a little tired of roger stone's
[03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:42.120]  um comments about ted cruise and his wife look women are far beyond
[03:25:42.120 --> 03:25:46.520]  the age where they should be kept in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant
[03:25:46.520 --> 03:25:51.320]  okay their career decisions are their business
[03:25:51.320 --> 03:25:55.880]  and it's not ted cruise's fault that his wife worked for goldman sacks
[03:25:55.880 --> 03:26:00.600]  it's not ted cruise's fault that she worked for condoleezza rice for a while
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:06.920]  that's ridiculous and i really get tired of that being pushed and pushed and
[03:26:06.920 --> 03:26:12.040]  pushed and i just think we need to think independently and not just follow
[03:26:12.040 --> 03:26:17.080]  whatever line some supporter keeps keeps pushing
[03:26:17.080 --> 03:26:21.720]  well i think the case against ted cruise is building rapidly personally for myself
[03:26:21.720 --> 03:26:25.240]  i mean he does have you could say there's no ties to goldman sacks but there are
[03:26:25.240 --> 03:26:30.440]  ties there and goldman sacks is one of the main companies involved in the 2008
[03:26:30.440 --> 03:26:32.920]  banking crisis and it's probably been involved
[03:26:32.920 --> 03:26:37.480]  since then i mean these goldman sacks goes into countries and destroys them
[03:26:37.480 --> 03:26:40.600]  that's what this company does so people involved with that you have to wonder
[03:26:40.600 --> 03:26:43.960]  about their moral character and ted cruise walks to walk around
[03:26:43.960 --> 03:26:48.440]  pretending he is the moral center of everything and that whatever he says is
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:52.200]  you know piously moral well let's look at your wife
[03:26:52.200 --> 03:26:55.960]  you know this is the person you married so i think you had to do the same thing
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:26:58.840]  with you know hillary clinton here's your husband
[03:26:58.840 --> 03:27:02.040]  what kind of person is your husband what does that say about you if you're not
[03:27:02.040 --> 03:27:05.000]  going to repudiate that stuff now she hasn't been accused of anything but
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:08.040]  you have to look at who she works to surrounds herself with and now
[03:27:08.040 --> 03:27:11.960]  who is ted cruise surrounding himself with two bushes
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:15.000]  a cruise in the bush i don't know if you can trust him that's all i gotta say
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:19.080]  but thanks for calling uncle willy and uh thanks for listening to us and
[03:27:19.080 --> 03:27:22.680]  remember we are a show we're not trying to program you in any way shape or form
[03:27:22.680 --> 03:27:26.360]  let's go to robin washington it's time about a protest going on in washington
[03:27:26.360 --> 03:27:29.960]  right now rob what's going on oh thanks for taking my call
[03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:33.880]  mm-hmm yeah i just thought it was incredible that
[03:27:33.880 --> 03:27:38.040]  story about the protesters in western washington university
[03:27:38.040 --> 03:27:44.680]  uh i listened to a radio station k gmi that's local out of belliam
[03:27:44.680 --> 03:27:48.280]  basically live a stone's throw from there but i thought it was
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:52.120]  uh hilarious the news story that they put on
[03:27:52.120 --> 03:27:58.040]  was the protesters were attacked by a discredited person in the car you know
[03:27:58.040 --> 03:28:03.560]  that was blocked by them blocking traffic and in the news story it said
[03:28:03.560 --> 03:28:08.440]  uh injuries included uh dislocated shoulder
[03:28:08.440 --> 03:28:13.000]  uh sprained fingers and bruises and i wouldn't have when looked at the video
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:19.080]  was a nine-second video and there's a woman who points at the car the whole
[03:28:19.080 --> 03:28:23.640]  thing seems uh staged to me but it didn't mean it could be
[03:28:23.640 --> 03:28:26.760]  true i just thought that was uh hilarious i'm not even pulling that up i've
[03:28:26.760 --> 03:28:30.920]  pulled up protest western washington university and i don't even see anything
[03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:35.320]  oh yeah if you go to k gmi

[03:36:42.920 --> 03:36:45.880]  steps of the white house so let's roll that report
[03:36:45.880 --> 03:36:50.200]  a bizarre turn of events in a story that caught the attention of the nation
[03:36:50.200 --> 03:36:55.240]  a pastor gunned down in his church parking lot igniting a multi-state manhunt
[03:36:55.240 --> 03:36:58.040]  came to an end on the other side of the country
[03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:02.360]  kyle odum was apprehended safely and without incident in washington dc this
[03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:05.160]  evening prior to his arrest court lame police chief lee
[03:37:05.160 --> 03:37:08.280]  white says odum threw several items over the fence
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:11.160]  at the white house the initial information i'm receiving is that those
[03:37:11.160 --> 03:37:13.480]  included some flash drives along with some other
[03:37:13.480 --> 03:37:17.720]  unknown items today odum was on his facebook page he posted a bizarre rant
[03:37:17.720 --> 03:37:20.840]  about why he opened fire on pastor tim remington
[03:37:20.840 --> 03:37:25.880]  and that post helped lead authorities to him abc news now confirming that police
[03:37:25.880 --> 03:37:29.400]  were able to track odum after this post in which he said
[03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:33.080]  the world is ruled by an ancient civilization for mars
[03:37:33.080 --> 03:37:36.920]  pastor tim was one of them and he was the reason my life was ruined i shot
[03:37:36.920 --> 03:37:40.200]  pastor to it at him 12 times there is no way
[03:37:40.200 --> 03:37:44.600]  any human could have survived that event odum also changed his profile picture
[03:37:44.600 --> 03:37:49.480]  to a hand drawing of a creature with green eyes that same picture
[03:37:49.480 --> 03:37:53.000]  found in a manifesto odum sent to kekso ifor news
[03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:56.760]  the pages of that rambling statement laid out his belief that remington was
[03:37:56.760 --> 03:37:59.640]  a martian and so were many members of the u.s house of
[03:37:59.640 --> 03:38:03.800]  representatives and the senate as well as some members of the israeli
[03:38:03.800 --> 03:38:07.800]  leadership also in the manifesto a note to president obama
[03:38:07.800 --> 03:38:12.200]  not a threat but a message warning him about the martians telling him
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:16.200]  to stay strong i don't know what you make of that but
[03:38:16.200 --> 03:38:22.120]  this this poor guy obviously has got some thinking to do
[03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:26.040]  and i mean if he thinks you know we could be ruled by aliens i don't know but
[03:38:26.040 --> 03:38:29.400]  we have yet to see one in that hand drawn description kind of reminds me of
[03:38:29.400 --> 03:38:32.840]  the leprechaun story when they thought there was a leprechaun up in the tree
[03:38:32.840 --> 03:38:38.680]  and i think it was alabama somewhere and they showed the artist sketch
[03:38:38.680 --> 03:38:42.760]  but now let's get to something really serious what's going on in cps in texas
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:46.280]  is truly revolutionary and i think is going to start a chain reaction going
[03:38:46.280 --> 03:38:49.480]  through the rest of the country because cps is an organization
[03:38:49.480 --> 03:38:52.920]  out of control of course it was formed to do something good to protect children
[03:38:52.920 --> 03:38:56.600]  who were being abused and put them in families where they could be safe
[03:38:56.600 --> 03:39:00.840]  but that's not what's happening now cps is not an organization that i think
[03:39:00.840 --> 03:39:05.080]  does that anymore uh here's a new american story when cps
[03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:09.240]  kids and apps children for money and you read down in it talks about how they
[03:39:09.240 --> 03:39:13.320]  get thousands of dollars per child that they keep in foster care
[03:39:13.320 --> 03:39:16.760]  and the longer those children stand foster care the more money they get
[03:39:16.760 --> 03:39:21.880]  and they also get more money as they are able to prescribe them more drugs
[03:39:21.880 --> 03:39:25.400]  so they always go in to visit the psychologist or psychiatrist and the
[03:39:25.400 --> 03:39:28.680]  psychiatrist gives them more more drugs and they get more money
[03:39:28.680 --> 03:39:32.920]  and the point is not to reunite these children with their families
[03:39:32.920 --> 03:39:36.760]  the point is to keep more children in the system so the system gets more money
[03:39:36.760 --> 03:39:42.280]  here's the article from december 17 2015 federal judge finds texas has broken
[03:39:42.280 --> 03:39:46.360]  foster care system says she'll order changes
[03:39:46.360 --> 03:39:52.120]  the long term foster care in texas is broken and routinely does grave harm
[03:39:52.120 --> 03:39:56.040]  to children already dealt a tough hand a federal judge ruled on thursday
[03:39:56.040 --> 03:39:59.240]  us district judge janice graham jack of corpus christie
[03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:03.160]  said the state violated the constitution by keeping about 12 000 youngsters for
[03:40:03.160 --> 03:40:07.320]  years in underfunded and poorly run system where rape abuse
[03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:12.680]  psychotropic medication and instability are the norm
[03:40:12.680 --> 03:40:16.200]  all right i'll read that one more time guys can you put the camera on that so
[03:40:16.200 --> 03:40:21.400]  we can see that rape abuse psychotropic medication
[03:40:21.400 --> 03:40:26.360]  and instability are the norm right there that's what she said and that's
[03:40:26.360 --> 03:40:29.160]  quoted but the system despite 20 years of reports and
[03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:32.840]  attempted fixes keeps harming children it's supposed to help
[03:40:32.840 --> 03:40:37.400]  the stinging opinion reads now i'll get into what changes she's going to
[03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:40.840]  propose but one of the defendants in that case
[03:40:40.840 --> 03:40:45.000]  the top official in the texas department of family and protective surfaces dfps
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:47.960]  announced that he is stepping down may 31st
[03:40:47.960 --> 03:40:52.040]  and that's judge john specia jr announced friday he intends to retire after
[03:40:52.040 --> 03:40:56.040]  30 years of public service so that's what yeah i guess you get to do
[03:40:56.040 --> 03:41:01.000]  after you you run a system for that with this federal judge says for 20 years
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:04.840]  it's totally broken you get to retire get a healthy pension
[03:41:04.840 --> 03:41:08.920]  and uh i guess he probably retired so he'd get no investigation
[03:41:08.920 --> 03:41:12.600]  now we have texas caseworkers who are going up to the the capital
[03:41:12.600 --> 03:41:15.240]  and they want to fight tooth and now against this court order potentially
[03:41:15.240 --> 03:41:18.440]  costly reforms of the state's foster care system and
[03:41:18.440 --> 03:41:20.840]  position that's drawn fierce criticism from child
[03:41:20.840 --> 03:41:24.440]  welfare advocates so they're trying to say oh but it's everything's fine we
[03:41:24.440 --> 03:41:29.080]  don't we don't need to make changes so let's look at a few stories that maybe
[03:41:29.080 --> 03:41:31.960]  maybe they do need to make changes investigators looking to death of
[03:41:31.960 --> 03:41:35.480]  infant and foster home authorities are investigating the death of a three
[03:41:35.480 --> 03:41:39.400]  month old boy who died in a temple foster home on saturday
[03:41:39.400 --> 03:41:43.560]  um julie moody of child protective services uh is investigating the death
[03:41:43.560 --> 03:41:46.200]  of the child in foster home while cps was investigating
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:49.320]  the biological family so they pulled these kids out they put them in foster
[03:41:49.320 --> 03:41:53.160]  homes and then they die here's a case just up north here of austin
[03:41:53.160 --> 03:41:57.080]  this is from 2014 justice for toddler beaten to death
[03:41:57.080 --> 03:42:00.600]  as her foster mother is sentenced to life in prison for her murder and here's a
[03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:03.640]  picture of the vile creature scroll down to that so we
[03:42:03.640 --> 03:42:07.000]  can see the creature who beat a two-year-old girl to death
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:11.320]  they think with like an iron pole or something and then you can see pictures
[03:42:11.320 --> 03:42:15.160]  of the little girl her name was alex hill she was two years old when she died
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:19.400]  as a result of massive brain hemorrhaging now why what was the threat
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:22.840]  what were her parents doing were they beating her no
[03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:26.600]  a neighbor turned them in because they smelled marijuana the police showed up
[03:42:26.600 --> 03:42:30.440]  they admitted that they were smoking it so they immediately took the girl away
[03:42:30.440 --> 03:42:33.080]  that's why you don't talk to these people when they come to your house
[03:42:33.080 --> 03:42:36.600]  you ask them to make an appointment and you record everything and you don't
[03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:38.920]  answer anything unless you have an attorney present
[03:42:38.920 --> 03:42:42.040]  you do not incriminate yourself because anything you say canon will be used
[03:42:42.040 --> 03:42:43.880]  against you and this is all done color law
[03:42:43.880 --> 03:42:47.080]  they just take the child there's no court there's no due process
[03:42:47.080 --> 03:42:49.320]  they take the child while they're investigating and while they were
[03:42:49.320 --> 03:42:53.480]  investigating she died children slain and mass
[03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:57.000]  murder were abused in foster care judge says
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:42:59.960]  david connelly charged with capital murder after eight found dead
[03:42:59.960 --> 03:43:05.800]  inside home that's in harris county cps involved before teen girl stab killed
[03:43:05.800 --> 03:43:12.920]  in lubbock county and texas cps makes changes after child's death
[03:43:12.920 --> 03:43:16.440]  so there's a lot of death going on in the foster care system
[03:43:16.440 --> 03:43:22.360]  you would i think you're 12 000 times more likely to be abused in foster care
[03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:25.240]  but they don't want to make changes and what's the judge asking for let's look
[03:43:25.240 --> 03:43:28.920]  at these horrible changes the judge is asking and once it's done once the
[03:43:28.920 --> 03:43:32.120]  judge one that's done in 30 days requiring each child in long-term care
[03:43:32.120 --> 03:43:35.720]  to have a special attorney as well as a court appointed special
[03:43:35.720 --> 03:43:41.240]  advocate they also they have a special master
[03:43:41.240 --> 03:43:44.600]  will study child abuse in the homes and group homes and treatment centers the
[03:43:44.600 --> 03:43:47.400]  masters will push for the state to move children
[03:43:47.400 --> 03:43:51.160]  who have not had severe behavior or physical impairments
[03:43:51.160 --> 03:43:55.320]  to be in less restrictive settings cps would also improve case files
[03:43:55.320 --> 03:43:58.040]  to it keeps on children including annual photos
[03:43:58.040 --> 03:44:01.480]  to help identify runaways it will also stop placing children in certain foster
[03:44:01.480 --> 03:44:05.000]  homes and unsafe placements like foster group homes that like 24 hour
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:09.560]  awake night supervision uh marcia robinson laury the founder of the
[03:44:09.560 --> 03:44:13.240]  new york based child children's rights which led to the effort to have these
[03:44:13.240 --> 03:44:16.280]  similar suits filed in dozens of states called jack's decision stunning and
[03:44:16.280 --> 03:44:19.800]  painstakingly researched and she also said texas has certainly one of the
[03:44:19.800 --> 03:44:24.760]  worst foster care systems in the country
[03:44:24.760 --> 03:44:28.680]  so this is good news this is something i think a lot of people
[03:44:28.680 --> 03:44:32.440]  have been fighting for um the deceased senator
[03:44:32.440 --> 03:44:37.320]  nancy schaefer was fighting for this she was killed in her home they say by her
[03:44:37.320 --> 03:44:40.840]  husband who then committed suicide i don't believe that one second she was
[03:44:40.840 --> 03:44:43.160]  getting into these people these are child kidnappers
[03:44:43.160 --> 03:44:46.520]  and they want to do harm to children and they place them in with people
[03:44:46.520 --> 03:44:50.040]  who really want to do harm with children and they get paid to do this it's
[03:44:50.040 --> 03:44:54.760]  totally disgusting so let's go to your calls again once again so
[03:44:54.760 --> 03:44:57.640]  hopefully we can turn that into an article and get more information out to
[03:44:57.640 --> 03:45:01.320]  people dave in pennsylvania wants to talk about the obama phone lady at the
[03:45:01.320 --> 03:45:05.800]  ohio convention bramney he sucks

[03:48:47.400 --> 03:48:49.800]  know we are going to these two conventions
[03:48:49.800 --> 03:48:52.920]  coming up the democratic national convention and the republican national
[03:48:52.920 --> 03:48:55.400]  convention so that sounds like we might be able to
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:48:58.120]  work something out thanks for calling mark i really appreciate i'm going to
[03:48:58.120 --> 03:49:01.960]  jump now go to phil in florida phil what do you want to say about
[03:49:01.960 --> 03:49:05.880]  ted cruise yeah that just what that guy that called
[03:49:05.880 --> 03:49:08.520]  in earlier that was complaining about roger stone
[03:49:08.520 --> 03:49:12.680]  kind of peripheral implications that he was some kind of sexist
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:17.320]  is ridiculous the thing about info wars is that we do not underestimate the
[03:49:17.320 --> 03:49:20.360]  women and that his wife may actually have her
[03:49:20.360 --> 03:49:24.760]  satanic hopes in him well we don't know if she's
[03:49:24.760 --> 03:49:28.120]  we don't know if she's satanic or not but i will say this here this came out of
[03:49:28.120 --> 03:49:31.800]  media i ted cruise lies uh right to christian
[03:49:31.800 --> 03:49:34.760]  journalists face about tithing you know if you're a christian you're supposed
[03:49:34.760 --> 03:49:38.440]  to give 10 to the church oh they estimate he gives
[03:49:38.440 --> 03:49:42.760]  like less than one percent so that's i guess that's a christian
[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:48.280]  for you i don't know but go ahead cfr connection
[03:49:48.280 --> 03:49:52.280]  right yeah connected to cfr and goldman and all that stuff i mean
[03:49:52.280 --> 03:49:56.920]  you don't get in there unless you're uh in some kind of eyewide shut convention
[03:49:56.920 --> 03:50:00.280]  sure and you know one thing about donald trump he just came out and
[03:50:00.280 --> 03:50:03.880]  didn't endorse richard hospice that he's one of his advisors and richard hospice
[03:50:03.880 --> 03:50:06.520]  i think head of the cfr so we have to watch that too
[03:50:06.520 --> 03:50:09.960]  we have to be aware of every nook and cranny because he's globalist for
[03:50:09.960 --> 03:50:14.280]  everywhere and their their agenda is to get rid of national borders and
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:17.720]  create a one-world government and that's what we're fighting against because
[03:50:17.720 --> 03:50:21.640]  when you have one when that goes away it's autonomous robots on the streets
[03:50:21.640 --> 03:50:25.240]  it's chips in your hand it's tracking everywhere
[03:50:25.240 --> 03:50:27.880]  there are they're going to try to do with the cars first and then you know 10
[03:50:27.880 --> 03:50:30.520]  years from now it's going to be a grain of rice stuck in your hand it'll probably
[03:50:30.520 --> 03:50:34.200]  smaller than that so we have to be aware of all that we'll be back one more

[03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:34.600]  analysis of it the next day we'll see if it's uh
[03:54:34.600 --> 03:54:37.800]  that was a total ambush hatchet job they did last time on
[03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:41.480]  donald trump with megyn kelly in the front and then he was getting hit from
[03:54:41.480 --> 03:54:45.960]  either side between ted cruise and uh the incredible shrinking rubio
[03:54:45.960 --> 03:54:51.480]  let's go to travis in texas let's talk about cps travis go ahead
[03:54:51.480 --> 03:54:56.520]  hey how you doing rob i'm doing great hey thanks for everything you guys do out
[03:54:56.520 --> 03:55:02.360]  there and info wars appreciate it i was calling about uh just the your cps
[03:55:02.360 --> 03:55:05.800]  thing going on my wife's and cps here in texas
[03:55:05.800 --> 03:55:09.640]  yeah what does she think of these changes that are being proposed
[03:55:09.640 --> 03:55:13.400]  well they they're trying to do some good changes at least uh
[03:55:13.400 --> 03:55:17.640]  they have a new group coming out that they just started called alternative
[03:55:17.640 --> 03:55:21.560]  response where these investigators are also
[03:55:21.560 --> 03:55:26.200]  doing uh an alternative response group where they're gonna
[03:55:26.200 --> 03:55:29.880]  they're sticking with the families and trying to work
[03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:35.640]  towards resolutions by offering um resources because their priority is to
[03:55:35.640 --> 03:55:40.120]  keep the families together i know there's been some bad incidences
[03:55:40.120 --> 03:55:44.040]  where these where cps has been made to look
[03:55:44.040 --> 03:55:47.800]  pretty bad but i know for a fact that they're
[03:55:47.800 --> 03:55:52.680]  understaffed heavily and these case workers are taken on probably
[03:55:52.680 --> 03:55:58.280]  20 to 30 cases on one investigator and now they're doing an alternative
[03:55:58.280 --> 03:56:02.600]  response group where these case workers are also having to go out and
[03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:08.200]  revisit families that had cases closed just to check on the kids
[03:56:08.200 --> 03:56:11.560]  so they're they're way overworked and it's getting real
[03:56:11.560 --> 03:56:15.640]  it's it is getting hard on them but uh i think that's the plan though i think
[03:56:15.640 --> 03:56:19.960]  the plan is to keep them overworked so they can't do quality it's a it's about
[03:56:19.960 --> 03:56:23.080]  quantity it's about getting kids into the system
[03:56:23.080 --> 03:56:27.400]  you know not everybody has a perfect day you know i don't think you take a kid
[03:56:27.400 --> 03:56:30.200]  away from a home because you catch you know one of the guys that they didn't
[03:56:30.200 --> 03:56:33.240]  even catch the guy smoking pot he just admitted to it
[03:56:33.240 --> 03:56:37.640]  they took the kid the kid gets beaten to death i mean you can't have that
[03:56:37.640 --> 03:56:40.040]  you cannot have a system like that and say that that
[03:56:40.040 --> 03:56:44.520]  well you know when it's it's not just one bad apple too the foster care system
[03:56:44.520 --> 03:56:48.600]  and it's the cps people that should be in charge of the foster care system and
[03:56:48.600 --> 03:56:51.640]  if something's going on they need to be getting rid of these
[03:56:51.640 --> 03:56:55.560]  foster care people but they get the money from it and the money is too
[03:56:55.560 --> 03:56:59.320]  alluring that's my feeling but go ahead continue
[03:56:59.320 --> 03:57:02.760]  yeah you have to you have to understand that cps isn't going out
[03:57:02.760 --> 03:57:06.520]  finding these people these people are report are you know they get the
[03:57:06.520 --> 03:57:10.360]  reports from other people they're concerned for about children
[03:57:10.360 --> 03:57:13.880]  and then when the cps investigator goes out there
[03:57:13.880 --> 03:57:18.920]  they investigate the parents and and in the well-being of the child and then
[03:57:18.920 --> 03:57:23.720]  from that point on they have to determine if these parents
[03:57:23.720 --> 03:57:26.520]  are capable of taking care of the children or not
[03:57:26.520 --> 03:57:30.520]  right and then okay and then once that happens which
[03:57:30.520 --> 03:57:34.920]  it could be you know i haven't seen a case so far
[03:57:34.920 --> 03:57:41.640]  where there's been marijuana involved for an example and a kid gets taken away
[03:57:41.640 --> 03:57:45.400]  they have to look to their immediate family first to see if there's a place
[03:57:45.400 --> 03:57:49.240]  that they can place the child with in their immediate family before they go
[03:57:49.240 --> 03:57:52.360]  into foster care well that didn't happen alex hill
[03:57:52.360 --> 03:57:55.880]  she was immediately taken away and it's a sad sad case
[03:57:55.880 --> 03:57:59.880]  thanks for calling travis for providing that other side of the
