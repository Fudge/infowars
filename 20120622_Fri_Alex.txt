[02:06.440 --> 02:13.320]  dark night rises the final installment with the Christian bail piece because
[02:13.320 --> 02:17.880]  it's full of propaganda we happen to have been able to talk to somebody who
[02:17.880 --> 02:22.000]  did see one of the screenings one of the focus groups now they they they
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.400]  changed some of the editing after this person saw it but we pretty much got the
[02:26.400 --> 02:32.600]  plot and we're going to spoil the whole thing here on here it's what we do I'm
[02:32.600 --> 02:37.760]  just I'm not going to give it all away you notice I mean we did a whole review
[02:37.760 --> 02:42.240]  of Prometheus was all this speculation and people like oh there's no way this
[02:42.240 --> 02:45.960]  is really what it's about and you notice you go watch my review secrets of
[02:45.960 --> 02:51.320]  Prometheus leaked and eight minute video this one's eight minutes to and it's
[02:51.320 --> 02:57.200]  exactly what I said it was and people are like well why review movies well when
[02:57.200 --> 03:00.600]  it gets into directed
[03:01.320 --> 03:09.680]  transpermia panspermia what the elite believe in that that humans were seated
[03:09.680 --> 03:13.960]  here by aliens whether you believe that whether it's true or not the point is
[03:13.960 --> 03:20.560]  the ruling class believes this and the documents that I present in that little
[03:20.560 --> 03:28.200]  piece on secrets of Prometheus film leaked is accurate and we show their
[03:28.200 --> 03:32.320]  quotes the documents the world leaders what they're into and that woke up a lot
[03:32.320 --> 03:39.040]  of people now I will be reviewing the rise of the dark night the final
[03:39.040 --> 03:44.480]  installment that's coming out I will be giving you a review a little less than a
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.240]  month for comes out July 20th and I'm not hurting their film and doing in a
[03:48.240 --> 03:52.680]  favor and I'm not going to spoil the whole thing I'm mainly going to analyze
[03:52.680 --> 03:58.320]  the propaganda in it because it's in all these major films and people especially
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.440]  the childlike adult men who don't think of themselves as powerful or effective
[04:03.440 --> 04:09.000]  but fantasize about supermen all day that's why they never get off the couch
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.720]  they never get involved because they're children that they have the minds of
[04:12.720 --> 04:17.480]  children arrested development and they they could never fight Terry because
[04:17.480 --> 04:22.200]  they're not Superman or Batman or the Green Lantern they can't fly around in
[04:22.200 --> 04:28.640]  outer space and fight you know planet-size demons like Green Lantern and by
[04:28.640 --> 04:32.240]  the way I can go see those films and enjoy them and think they're entertaining
[04:32.240 --> 04:37.400]  but when I sit there watching 35 40 year old men who in an eyeing and acting like
[04:37.400 --> 04:43.600]  my son well he acts less boy like it really freaks me out that's what I'm
[04:43.600 --> 04:47.000]  saying nothing wrong with these films if you're aware you're being bombarded
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.360]  propaganda nothing wrong with it as long as you're aware of that and and as long
[04:51.360 --> 04:55.400]  as you don't mix fantasy with reality but the big news is coming up stay with
[04:55.400 --> 04:59.320]  us I've even gotten into the news we'll be right back

[09:11.080 --> 09:16.520]  entirely hung out for a few days but another very interesting mind and he is
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.760]  gonna be doing a quick interview with me tomorrow okay wow where where to start
[09:22.760 --> 09:30.280]  here obviously one of the big rating agencies Moody's has downgraded some of
[09:30.280 --> 09:36.280]  the big mega banks but investors have pointed out everyone's known this for a
[09:36.280 --> 09:42.480]  long time and now they've gotten multiple bailouts for Spain multiple
[09:42.480 --> 09:48.240]  bailouts for Greece and all these other bailouts in places like Ireland and
[09:48.240 --> 09:53.480]  other places and they call it a bailout but most the money the same in every
[09:53.480 --> 09:58.240]  country is always over 90% goes to the banks who then lecture us on how we're
[09:58.240 --> 10:02.440]  spending too much and how weird you know the reason that we're going into a
[10:02.440 --> 10:06.840]  global depression and then they point at the dependent people government
[10:06.840 --> 10:14.720]  employees welfare folks and say that they're the cause of everything when
[10:14.720 --> 10:19.480]  they're a very small part of it and and they're the group though that's
[10:19.480 --> 10:25.200]  dependent whether they're good or bad that the system then rallies out to call
[10:25.200 --> 10:31.520]  for more government but the majority of the money goes to the bankers but I'm
[10:31.520 --> 10:35.640]  going to get into this more later it's just that Mario Monty the big Goldman
[10:35.640 --> 10:41.160]  Sachs guy that they installed they admit they they installed him
[10:42.400 --> 10:47.920]  Mr. Monty came out and said we have a week to save the Eurozone every couple
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.760]  weeks we hear we have a week give us 200 billion more for Greece give us a
[10:53.760 --> 10:58.320]  hundred and something billion this week for Spain no it's another 300 billion
[10:58.320 --> 11:02.960]  the next week and now it's 500 billion and you got one week to give us this
[11:02.960 --> 11:08.240]  money and so you give the money to the banks I was looking at numbers even out
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.600]  of the Canadian papers that have come out in the last year where they borrowed
[11:12.600 --> 11:17.720]  less than 50 billion dollars in the 80s in Canada the government did from the
[11:17.720 --> 11:21.360]  private banks that own the private central bank up in Canada that they
[11:21.360 --> 11:29.280]  call a government bank the National Bank of Canada and now that money is over
[11:29.280 --> 11:38.080]  400 billion dollars and it all comes from money that was paid back in just a
[11:38.080 --> 11:43.480]  few years but it was designed to be paid back part of it slower so that now the
[11:43.480 --> 11:48.200]  country's in debt to these private banks that made it up out of nothing you see
[11:48.200 --> 11:53.320]  when you're a shareholder of the private Federal Reserve or the private Bank of
[11:53.320 --> 11:57.880]  England or the private you know other central banks around the world and in
[11:57.880 --> 12:03.560]  the stock of these banks is all owned by the same group it's less than 10 banks
[12:03.560 --> 12:07.480]  globally six big banks here in the United States they're all interconnected to
[12:07.480 --> 12:15.840]  the European banks it's all one big metastasizing cancer and there's no
[12:15.840 --> 12:23.080]  way to ever pay it back they designed the whole derivative scam show that it's
[12:23.080 --> 12:27.120]  mathematically impossible it's a black hole that's what they call it in
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.380]  financial circles that sucks everything into it and once they get their
[12:31.380 --> 12:35.120]  minions into office everywhere they just keep holding you hostage saying give
[12:35.120 --> 12:40.000]  us a hundred billion more this week 300 billion the next week 500 billion the
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.600]  next week that's what they're saying right now and it's always or everything
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.400]  will collapse at the end of the week we have one more week and but this will
[12:48.400 --> 12:52.480]  fix it this time and then a week later we need 500 billion more or it will
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.400]  totally collapse and they're saying Germany you haven't paid enough into the
[12:57.400 --> 13:01.600]  eurozone and Germany by the way is the one that's in the greatest debt now and
[13:01.600 --> 13:06.760]  they act like it's Germany rising again Germany runs the euro Germany signed all
[13:06.760 --> 13:12.520]  of its sovereignty over to the unelected EU bureaucracy so it's another red
[13:12.520 --> 13:19.600]  herring like shrewd move Germany you took over without firing a shot and I
[13:19.600 --> 13:23.020]  told you years ago they would start with Greece because it's little 2% of the
[13:23.020 --> 13:26.840]  eurozone and then make it all it's all about those Greeks well we've got to do
[13:26.840 --> 13:29.920]  it as a whole thing will come down oh it's all about those Spanish oh it's all
[13:29.920 --> 13:33.400]  about those Italians oh it's all about it's all about those Swiss because they
[13:33.400 --> 13:37.280]  won't join the euro it's all about those Germans it's all about those French it's
[13:37.280 --> 13:41.640]  all about those yellows people they only work one hour a day and then they get
[13:41.640 --> 13:47.320]  months of vacation lazy people there and part of that's true because you've got
[13:47.320 --> 13:53.000]  giant government bureaucracies of bossy henpecking agents that come and get in
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.800]  your face in these countries and it is out of control and there is but but it
[13:59.800 --> 14:05.280]  doesn't matter that's what the banksters set up that's their client group that
[14:05.280 --> 14:10.440]  that squat on type of the countries in a parasitic fashion you know they tell
[14:10.440 --> 14:14.640]  the cops as the memos have come out you've got to write so many tickets you've
[14:14.640 --> 14:20.080]  got to get so many arrests quotas we or we're gonna have to lay off officers and
[14:20.080 --> 14:25.120]  the cops go out write the money and it ends up going to the city or the county
[14:25.120 --> 14:30.200]  of the state and most of it around 76% goes into international derivatives
[14:30.200 --> 14:35.120]  investments that's never coming back and no amount of ticket writing no amount of
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.160]  taxes is going to fix anything in fact they knew when they massively increase
[14:40.160 --> 14:45.000]  VAT and created a new expanded sales tax to be paid directly into the euro in
[14:45.000 --> 14:51.520]  Greece that it would stall the economy less than six months into this Greece is
[14:51.520 --> 14:57.760]  in cardiac arrest all the major hospitals are working without pay the
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.000]  powers going off there are people starving on the streets crime has
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.040]  tripled the last six months this is in the news today people are starving like
[15:07.040 --> 15:13.040]  it's Argentina in 2000 2001 go from the richest country in Latin America on par
[15:13.040 --> 15:15.720]  with the US to just I've talked to people that have been down there Ted
[15:15.720 --> 15:19.240]  Anderson was down there a couple years ago just good-looking families not
[15:19.240 --> 15:25.440]  normal drunk homeless people living on in in in doorways okay just garbage
[15:25.440 --> 15:29.440]  everywhere people crapping in the streets I mean this is what they'll do and
[15:29.440 --> 15:33.480]  by the way they've now done that to Greece and so when you ratchet up the
[15:33.480 --> 15:40.200]  taxes in an already stalling economy the news is tax receipts plummet in Greece
[15:40.200 --> 15:43.040]  in fact guys I meant to cover that yesterday was in the stack just type
[15:43.040 --> 15:49.600]  in tax revenue plummets in Greece what wait wait you raise the taxes and less
[15:49.600 --> 15:54.800]  comes in that's the plan that's the plan they've got them leveraged into total
[15:54.800 --> 16:01.120]  debt made up by nothing by the bankers on record and now look at California they
[16:01.120 --> 16:07.080]  passed the carbon tax 20 something percent starts past it last year starts
[16:07.080 --> 16:12.840]  going in to effect this year and already it's called the Great Exodus you've
[16:12.840 --> 16:19.280]  seen that because hundreds of different types of businesses have the expenses
[16:19.280 --> 16:24.520]  passed on to them by the carbon taxes that are on key areas the economy and
[16:24.520 --> 16:29.840]  then out in California second-war state for prisons you're competing against
[16:29.840 --> 16:34.360]  prison industries with an average 23 cents an hour pay rate building
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.560]  everything from solar panels to engine parts to telemarketing you got seven
[16:39.560 --> 16:45.760]  million people behind bars working for 23 cents an hour below the Chinese
[16:45.760 --> 16:50.880]  slave wage and all these idiot good old boys wonder why they're going bankrupt
[16:50.880 --> 16:58.280]  yeah they got cable TV and then prisons yeah I saw it on TV no they don't they've
[16:58.280 --> 17:02.120]  got cable TV and minimum security white-collar prisons because the white
[17:02.120 --> 17:07.760]  collar people have set it up that way those have folks in Texas most of the
[17:07.760 --> 17:11.720]  prisons no longer have air conditioning and they're not built to not have air
[17:11.720 --> 17:15.280]  conditioning one thing if you had old long buildings with windows on both
[17:15.280 --> 17:20.240]  sides you could open up it's still hellish over 110 degrees inside they
[17:20.240 --> 17:24.480]  have the Texas prisons now in the last few years do not most of them do not have
[17:24.480 --> 17:33.160]  air conditioning anyway side issue the point is is that this is a total
[17:33.160 --> 17:38.680]  takeover of society and they put the prisoners in who are nonviolent they
[17:38.680 --> 17:42.320]  come out can't get a job at their felons now and so they now got a college
[17:42.320 --> 17:46.760]  degree in crime and the crime rate goes up the amount of drugs being shipped in
[17:46.760 --> 17:51.560]  goes up the police get more corrupt the society breaks down and the new American

[24:54.160 --> 24:59.480]  how many executives and millionaires and people that are successful I talk to who

[34:27.400 --> 34:31.920]  that it's official we say tomorrow you know if it was a Monday we'll say
[34:31.920 --> 34:36.320]  tomorrow next you know tomorrow's Tuesday and today was Monday in the third
[34:36.320 --> 34:40.040]  hour we will take calls from TSA whistleblowers and then we'll get a call
[34:40.040 --> 34:43.640]  and I'll say that sounds interesting and then we'll put them on hold and they
[34:43.640 --> 34:47.480]  can give us proof of who they are and it'll be even bigger we need to really
[34:47.480 --> 34:54.160]  start using the attributes we have which is millions of listeners every time
[34:54.160 --> 34:58.200]  there's a tragedy a mass shooting or also something you know breaking in the
[34:58.200 --> 35:02.240]  news we always have people right there on the campus calling in with the
[35:02.240 --> 35:07.040]  ambulances and the sirens in the background I can be anywhere in the
[35:07.040 --> 35:11.600]  US and say yeah I'm here you know over here at this trailer park you know parked
[35:11.600 --> 35:17.960]  here in the in the SUV doing the radio show or parked here in the bus and 20
[35:17.960 --> 35:21.000]  minutes later somebody pulls right in there a listener I'm in the middle of
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.680]  nowhere in Arkansas or Virginia or California we have listeners everywhere
[35:26.680 --> 35:32.360]  and not just in the US we can open the phones up during the flu in Mexico and
[35:32.360 --> 35:35.600]  just load the lines we have our own computerized lines everything take over
[35:35.600 --> 35:39.880]  100 calls and just hundreds of calls from Mexico about what was happening with
[35:39.880 --> 35:43.800]  the flu down there and what was really developing remember back when that was
[35:43.800 --> 35:48.480]  happening I want to open the phones up for Australians to call in because the
[35:48.480 --> 35:53.320]  carbon taxes start next Monday across the board prices in some areas are going
[35:53.320 --> 35:59.960]  to go up 50% you order lamb chops it's 50% because those are eating grass that's
[35:59.960 --> 36:03.800]  for the carbon and it's bad and they they have flatulence so the big tax I
[36:03.800 --> 36:07.760]  mean just hundreds of taxes inside of it whatever the bureaucrats want they give
[36:07.760 --> 36:10.760]  waivers for their friends and this is the global model this is what's starting
[36:10.760 --> 36:15.200]  up here and I'm gonna open the phones up to Australians or I could open the
[36:15.200 --> 36:18.680]  phones up to Germans well what do you think being told you've got to bail out
[36:18.680 --> 36:24.120]  all these big banks and quote welfare recipients in these countries I mean
[36:24.120 --> 36:30.320]  that's going to be a powerful and informative and newsmaking sector of
[36:30.320 --> 36:35.600]  this show so I am ordering my crew to make me because you know like a bird dog
[36:35.600 --> 36:42.040]  runs off down rabbit trails that's a good thing and a bad thing but I need to
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.720]  be you know directed here sometimes so I did just just I'm the program director
[36:46.720 --> 36:49.360]  here but I'm telling you guys to make sure I stay on the straight and narrow
[36:49.360 --> 36:55.600]  here and we can like pat and a pablo being in fashion will mount shockers in
[36:55.600 --> 36:59.760]  the chair there's a small shock and then know when I'm interrupting too much
[36:59.760 --> 37:07.640]  to that get hyper my brain's burning with information you just that's enough
[37:07.640 --> 37:12.960]  be the first radio show everywhere of like enough people vote you know like
[37:12.960 --> 37:16.680]  it people are mad at me suddenly big cattle prod comes down out of the
[37:16.680 --> 37:21.640]  ceiling I think the show would have high ratings we did that I'm not trying to
[37:21.640 --> 37:24.520]  just get ratings here I'm trying to just tell the truth and cover the news but
[37:24.520 --> 37:28.440]  there's a lot of funny stuff we could do okay that's enough that's enough that's
[37:28.440 --> 37:35.960]  enough I'm digressing let me get to our top story today out of all this news
[37:35.960 --> 37:39.160]  we've already mentioned and everything that's coming up and the guests we have
[37:39.160 --> 37:46.120]  joining us like Joel Gilbert who wrote dreams from my real father a story of
[37:46.120 --> 37:51.160]  reds and deception pretty compelling case that they discovered who Obama's real
[37:51.160 --> 37:57.760]  daddy is so that is coming up the filmmaker will be joining us and in the
[37:57.760 --> 38:00.520]  third hour for about 30 minutes we're going to have Lord Moncton pop in from
[38:00.520 --> 38:03.920]  Rio de Janeiro with his big report it's always informative a lot of breaks big
[38:03.920 --> 38:09.040]  news here they're making the tree this time secret but he has his ways of
[38:09.040 --> 38:13.320]  ferreting these things out he's been locked out of the conference as well if
[38:13.320 --> 38:16.400]  you had police beat him up once even though it is for no reason that was on
[38:16.400 --> 38:21.200]  video I was talking to reporter comes over and tackles him that was a Copenhagen
[38:21.200 --> 38:25.600]  get a parachute in when they were locking him out in Durban last year that's
[38:25.600 --> 38:30.640]  on video I'm not I'm not joking he said Alex have you seen me parachute in I had
[38:30.640 --> 38:33.600]  him on the nightly news I went no really you did they pull it up and I'm
[38:33.600 --> 38:37.920]  watching Moncton parachuting out into the event and then side issue I'm
[38:37.920 --> 38:44.000]  digressing that's coming up now this next story should get me really mad but
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.640]  it's why they're discredited and it's why they're a joke I didn't notice this
[38:50.640 --> 38:57.880]  until about almost a weekend to it and I happen to see a comment about newspapers
[38:57.880 --> 39:03.960]  all over the Midwest especially ran syndicated columns and it turned out
[39:03.960 --> 39:07.680]  there were a bunch of them so this was done in a concerted effort all over the
[39:07.680 --> 39:11.960]  Midwest but also in Montana Wyoming everywhere there's rural people that are
[39:11.960 --> 39:15.600]  a little bit more street smart when it comes to not trust in the government
[39:15.600 --> 39:20.080]  people that live closer to reality than some of the you know modern city folks
[39:20.080 --> 39:24.960]  that only watch dancing with the stars I saw listeners commenting saying Alex
[39:24.960 --> 39:29.680]  you got to get on this it's in you know both my local papers and it's in papers
[39:29.680 --> 39:32.760]  all over the Midwest and then I investigate it was all over the country
[39:32.760 --> 39:38.080]  when I say 500 publications it was 500 plus that came up on Google News if you
[39:38.080 --> 39:45.080]  typed in EPA drones okay this is just a few days ago now it's hundreds more so
[39:45.080 --> 39:52.040]  there is a concerted effort everywhere all over newspaper so many I can't even
[39:52.040 --> 39:57.680]  keep track of it saying oh the hoax has been exposed there are no drones no drones
[39:57.680 --> 40:03.240]  are coming there were never drones and the evil well only 15 or so that I've
[40:03.240 --> 40:08.320]  seen and say Alex Jones Matt drudge drudge report.com info wars.com
[40:08.320 --> 40:11.880]  normally they just blame others that picked up my report that drudge picked
[40:11.880 --> 40:17.360]  up that others then picked up but but but we're in there as the culprits as the
[40:17.360 --> 40:24.600]  source of the lie and we are deceptive we are discredited they say we have been
[40:24.600 --> 40:31.760]  routed I mean it's just Washington Post LA Times where's the LA Times another
[40:31.760 --> 40:35.840]  article the same day three days ago saying it's incredible people are really
[40:35.840 --> 40:39.880]  upset about the drones everywhere and drones over LA and drones here and drones
[40:39.880 --> 40:43.920]  there then another article saying the crazy people think there's drones what's
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.960]  happened here is this has captured people's imagination it's finally
[40:48.960 --> 40:53.200]  something a symbol wait a minute the drones that are used to kill the evil
[40:53.200 --> 40:56.040]  brown people you know we mean you know that's kind of the archetypal idea the
[40:56.040 --> 41:00.320]  evil turban people that the evil 9-11 vipers that the globalist publicly
[41:00.320 --> 41:04.000]  fun to attack Syria and Libby and everywhere else there's more news of
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.760]  that today you know they well it's okay to have drones killing them but still
[41:08.760 --> 41:13.040]  people know what is a remote control some of these are autonomous AI computers
[41:13.040 --> 41:18.240]  Terminator Skynet you know we don't like this but I guess it's okay it's for
[41:18.240 --> 41:23.520]  Al Qaeda so so this really became a big issue and states were getting upset and
[41:23.520 --> 41:30.600]  they introduced legislation on Monday in the house Ron Ron Paul has supported it
[41:30.600 --> 41:35.320]  Rand Paul has supported accompanying legislation in the Senate it was really
[41:35.320 --> 41:39.280]  gained in traction so what do they do they play possum there's no drones no
[41:39.280 --> 41:45.560]  no no though you know the people on Fox News what's her name Megan Kelly I
[41:45.560 --> 41:50.520]  forget yeah we have the clip in there yeah she she got it wrong it was not
[41:50.520 --> 41:55.060]  unmanned drones it was EPA spying on farmers and ranchers all over the
[41:55.060 --> 41:59.920]  country in Cessna's with camera pots so yes we're spying but it's not drones and
[41:59.920 --> 42:06.120]  you're discredited and all they did was go into our article and with one link
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.360]  about their spying and then we had other links about their research projects
[42:10.360 --> 42:14.280]  using unmanned drones to spy and they just took that one area and built a
[42:14.280 --> 42:23.120]  straw man and said it wasn't true and ran 500 plus articles on the news just
[42:23.120 --> 42:28.840]  clicking Google news thousands of hits I saw on blogs and in democratic
[42:28.840 --> 42:33.440]  operative sites just saying haha doesn't exist Alex Jones the evil cook
[42:33.440 --> 42:37.720]  conspiracy theorists right we extremists and then his cohort drudged it
[42:37.720 --> 42:41.360]  picked it up and made it go viral and everyone picked it up and they're
[42:41.360 --> 42:46.880]  discredited and and and and and the Fox News girl she said okay we're wrong
[42:46.880 --> 42:52.040]  it's not drones it's manned aircraft spying and the Daily Show picked it up
[42:52.040 --> 42:57.680]  haha it's so funny so I called Watson up and he was on vacation for a week and a
[42:57.680 --> 43:01.600]  half visiting family he gets back I talked to him Wednesday night I said
[43:01.600 --> 43:05.800]  listen I know I've read articles on air and I said I've sent some to you do an
[43:05.800 --> 43:13.240]  article on this I said I sent you a list of the EPA the FDA the the Department
[43:13.240 --> 43:18.760]  of Agriculture with all these drones and they've been buying them since 2009 three
[43:18.760 --> 43:23.280]  years ago here it is so he did the article today he did the article today
[43:23.280 --> 43:27.600]  and here it is he went and found a whole bunch more and it's admitted and yes
[43:27.600 --> 43:31.600]  they're doing it of course they are I saw articles five six years ago and we
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.920]  pulled them back up where they have the NSA spy satellites first article I saw
[43:35.920 --> 43:42.040]  was in the Denver Post and it was about farmers building barns when they've been
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.960]  told they can't with environmental laws and being caught expanding a barn with
[43:46.960 --> 43:51.600]  a spy satellite I mean and I pulled up the other day literally you have 15
[43:51.600 --> 43:56.160]  articles 20 articles a big stack and read them on air about this okay so yes
[43:56.160 --> 44:02.520]  it's going on and it just shows how they roll it all out and say they're spying
[44:02.520 --> 44:05.800]  on you and they're arming them and there's predator drones run by the Air
[44:05.800 --> 44:09.800]  Force are resting people on their ranches in North Dakota I mean you saw
[44:09.800 --> 44:14.720]  that last year and there have been more arrests now and they're using them and
[44:14.720 --> 44:18.840]  they're coming on people's property and so we finally wake up people finally get
[44:18.840 --> 44:23.280]  upset they get up in arms politically and the psych warfare goes he doesn't
[44:23.280 --> 44:26.960]  exist and there's all these condescending articles laughing at everyone
[44:26.960 --> 44:32.920]  strategically in all the farming towns and my listeners have been calling me
[44:32.920 --> 44:36.960]  send me clippings of it it's just everywhere there are no drones it's no
[44:36.960 --> 44:40.760]  big deal oh but we are watching you with cessness they've been doing that for 20
[44:40.760 --> 44:46.400]  years now it's getting bad they fly over and if after a rainstorm this is
[44:46.400 --> 44:51.360]  happening all over the country now and they either say you've got a puddle that
[44:51.360 --> 44:54.600]  formed in a ravine on your property and then come and say it's a wetland and
[44:54.600 --> 44:58.680]  try to take it they're actually taking houses every every day I see it every
[44:58.680 --> 45:01.360]  few weeks but if you look there's just thousands of cases a year I mean it's
[45:01.360 --> 45:06.960]  crazy look it up or they go and they show that you've got a feedlot on your
[45:06.960 --> 45:12.000]  own property and it rains and they show brown water running off towards a stream
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.720]  a half mile away and they come with fines with that as the evidence and find
[45:17.720 --> 45:25.080]  you for that life the little bits of cow manure they've always been bovine and
[45:25.080 --> 45:28.000]  animals walking around there were probably more buffalo running than there
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.880]  are cows today they've done metric breakdowns on that actuaries what do
[45:31.880 --> 45:35.000]  you think their dung did ran into the rivers what do you think makes the big
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.200]  Nile Delta so healthy for the fish you ever watch National Geographic that
[45:40.200 --> 45:45.880]  would be basically a dead river if it wasn't for wait for it hippopotamus
[45:45.880 --> 45:54.400]  poop again this is part of life on our planet if a pig farm or the big
[45:54.400 --> 45:58.200]  industrial pig farm you know with a half million pigs and toxic methane
[45:58.200 --> 46:01.160]  dumping out killing rivers oh they always get left alone of their big
[46:01.160 --> 46:06.920]  aggro no it's little farms little ranches everywhere there's a guy who
[46:06.920 --> 46:10.280]  creeps around his part of one of these groups where we've got a family ranch
[46:10.280 --> 46:14.440]  back to 1830 in East Texas and he goes around harassing people and doing all
[46:14.440 --> 46:18.560]  sorts of stuff and trying to cause problems and it's like the mafia and
[46:18.560 --> 46:22.440]  the local town ends up kissing his hind end to make him leave him alone how
[46:22.440 --> 46:26.960]  about people get back in his face you see it's pathetic what we've turned to
[46:26.960 --> 46:32.440]  turned into as a country and we're just so accustomed to the mainstream media
[46:32.440 --> 46:37.560]  lying about us we don't even get upset about it anymore I mean they called
[46:37.560 --> 46:43.720]  yours truly you know a liar that I published quote bogus articles to
[46:43.720 --> 46:48.520]  deceive people and you know occasionally we get something wrong or a date wrong
[46:48.520 --> 46:52.280]  or I mean I mean I make mistakes but not as much as a lot of people got a
[46:52.280 --> 46:56.260]  pretty good track record it sounds wild what we talk about because reality is so
[46:56.260 --> 47:01.240]  wild but the mainstream media they try to lie so many times especially if it's
[47:01.240 --> 47:04.920]  been politicized if it's just all this car wrecked here at this intersection
[47:04.920 --> 47:09.400]  it's usually true or if it's watermelon's cost this much at Winn-Dixie this
[47:09.400 --> 47:15.360]  week or this mayor got reelected or they're putting in a bypass on the
[47:15.360 --> 47:20.200]  highway here or this this company went bankrupt yeah yeah yeah that's true but
[47:20.200 --> 47:25.240]  when it's some big political agenda and you see it in 500 newspapers in a week
[47:25.240 --> 47:30.200]  that there are no drones that is a specific order that goes out from the
[47:30.200 --> 47:34.840]  highest levels of the power structure that whoa just like the TSA thing this
[47:34.840 --> 47:39.160]  drone thing people realize that hey we're the enemy now our money's being used
[47:39.160 --> 47:45.400]  against us there's this Skynet above us it's flying and government loves that
[47:45.400 --> 47:49.800]  idea that it's God and they're gonna with our tax money launch 30,000 drones
[47:49.800 --> 47:53.840]  it's all been announced and then we start talking about it drudge breaks the
[47:53.840 --> 48:01.200]  Berlin Wall of media blackout it goes viral and then they freak out yeah
[48:01.200 --> 48:05.960]  this that Missoulean article was syndicated in a bunch of bunch of
[48:05.960 --> 48:09.160]  places out of Montana show folks that that's one of the articles where it says
[48:09.160 --> 48:13.840]  I'm a conservative talk radio host Alex Jones published the bogus drone story on
[48:13.840 --> 48:18.440]  his website info wars.com on June 4th complete with a photograph of a military
[48:18.440 --> 48:22.760]  drone flying through blue skies yeah with a link to wire magazine and CBS about
[48:22.760 --> 48:27.040]  them arresting people with military drones over the US for for farming
[48:27.040 --> 48:31.960]  infractions I mean it's in the news the next day the New American a bi-weekly
[48:31.960 --> 48:34.800]  owned by the ultra conservative John Burt society reported the bogus story
[48:34.800 --> 48:38.320]  the story credited Nebraska's congressional delegation for the news
[48:38.320 --> 48:41.840]  the gist of the New America story was that drones are being used to spy on
[48:41.840 --> 48:46.200]  large feedlots were cattle urine and feces highly concentrated and
[48:46.200 --> 48:51.480]  potentially threatened water supplies it goes on how it was picked up box news
[48:51.480 --> 48:56.040]  and then they got asked questions you know at the White House press conference
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.520]  and it's so terrible and there's other articles but the evil drudge reports for
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.600]  one that edit he's got too much power people don't listen to us anymore it's
[49:03.600 --> 49:09.000]  terrible this is what they do well here's the article and I want folks I
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.160]  noticed in almost all these articles though I clicked on them our people were
[49:12.160 --> 49:15.400]  hammering and going oh what about this link what about that what about wired
[49:15.400 --> 49:18.440]  magazine what about what about the admissions of the drones being used by
[49:18.440 --> 49:23.160]  the government for environmental reasons and manned aircraft point is we're
[49:23.160 --> 49:28.080]  inspired on point is you don't want momentum building to kill legislation you
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.560]  want to act like it's not fashionable to be against drones see it's all about you
[49:32.560 --> 49:36.240]  being ignorant they think you're stupid you'll just oh it's not fashionable oh I

[55:56.400 --> 55:59.840]  was like three years old it was playing on one of those 45s you know on a
[55:59.840 --> 56:04.160]  child's record player that's an actual rap there I didn't come up with that I I
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.000]  just I'd be play I'd be plagiarizing if I didn't tell you that I remember hearing
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.440]  that on some Sesame Street comedy record or something I think it was oh my
[56:14.440 --> 56:19.840]  gosh we've now really plunged into weirdness hey it's gallows humor I can't
[56:19.840 --> 56:23.560]  just be serious all the time this stuff gets to me okay
[56:23.560 --> 56:33.280]  oh boy so by the way I saw the comments on this article at info wars.com by
[56:33.280 --> 56:38.680]  Paul Watson drone used to spy on Miami partygoers and the folks that shot it
[56:38.680 --> 56:43.280]  you know they have these Bay party deals they do the Miami Beach Memorial Day
[56:43.280 --> 56:47.440]  weekend celebrations and it's kind of a hip-hop crowd out there all dressed up
[56:47.440 --> 56:51.200]  in bathing suits it is the beach and I see all these comments you've gone to a
[56:51.200 --> 56:58.040]  new low showing us this hip-hop Gardens Jones this is absolutely disgusting what
[56:58.040 --> 57:01.760]  that people like to drive around and dress up in fancy cars and go have fun
[57:01.760 --> 57:07.040]  at the beach there are worse crimes and I see comments like good they look
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.200]  dangerous it's good to watch them with a drone the point is is there's 30,000
[57:11.200 --> 57:15.120]  drones being launched and I mean it's a lot of the comments here are like this
[57:15.120 --> 57:22.840]  is this is not family material it's some women in bathing suits at the beach the
[57:22.840 --> 57:27.640]  point here is that it's an exhibit because this is the only video of the
[57:27.640 --> 57:31.560]  drone and I went and searched the term drones in Miami and they've bought three
[57:31.560 --> 57:35.360]  different ones they've got a big one that's like a many many predator that
[57:35.360 --> 57:39.000]  flies around up to 10,000 feet watching people quietly and they got one that
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.800]  sounds like a weed eater taken off and they've got this one and it's got
[57:42.800 --> 57:46.280]  flashing lights they want you to know it's there it's a police drone and it's
[57:46.280 --> 57:52.240]  the only video of it in action I'm sick of everything becoming oh my gosh I saw
[57:52.240 --> 57:58.720]  some women in some bathing suits okay don't watch the video if it's so
[57:58.720 --> 58:05.160]  incredibly horrifying okay I don't think it's women in bathing suits you don't
[58:05.160 --> 58:10.240]  like I think it's black people you don't like anyways that's another issue I
[58:10.240 --> 58:13.280]  never got to this yesterday and I've got to get to it this is the media doing
[58:13.280 --> 58:16.960]  this they've got these new ads out billboards TV ads I want to play one of
[58:16.960 --> 58:21.440]  them where it says being white is inherently unfair and evil and they're
[58:21.440 --> 58:24.280]  running these and see I'm gonna give you the rest of story do you know what
[58:24.280 --> 58:28.160]  these ads actually do these are actually meant to create racial division so the
[58:28.160 --> 58:31.600]  government can be the referee and so people never actually become friends and
[58:31.600 --> 58:35.320]  get along this is to make everybody uncomfortable and it's gonna actually

[1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:09.080]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:20.720]  number one at New York Times best-selling author about a month ago
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:26.360]  Dr. Jerome Corsi told me I had to see this film dreams from my real father
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:31.360]  directed by Joel Gilbert who's joining us via video Skype for TV and radio
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:36.480]  listeners here in just a moment a story of reds and deception and he's sort of
[1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:39.480]  telling me the claims in the film it wasn't out yet and I was sent a screener
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:44.960]  a few weeks ago and after I saw it it fit into a lot of the research we've done
[1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:50.000]  again we don't know who Obama is that's been proven it was just in the news
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.920]  yesterday in the Daily Mail Obama's grandfather tortured by the British a
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:58.040]  fantasy like most of the president's own memoir and they now have had to admit
[1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:01.320]  the White House came out what last year and said well a lot of the memoir is
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:08.280]  just a composite what we'd like to say it's it's fiction parts up I mean his
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.640]  name was Barry Sataro he had this other name he looks nothing like the Kenyan
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:17.320]  dad the State Department had his dad thrown out saying it wasn't his dad he
[1:09:17.320 --> 1:09:21.800]  had a dead person social security number everybody knew him as Barry all these
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:27.120]  other fake names nobody's got stuff sealed his Harvard you know papers have
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:32.040]  been sealed but then we get some of them we get his publicist for 17 years 16 and
[1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:35.840]  a half years saying he was born in Kenya his wife on in speeches saying just
[1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:38.960]  five years ago four years ago he was born in Kenya we went back to his
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:44.840]  homeland Kenya his grandmother saying it the records are cut out over there but
[1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:49.880]  then did she go over there to have that story that he was born there and then
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:55.760]  later they changed it I don't know because the guy they say is his daddy it
[1:09:55.760 --> 1:10:00.520]  be like if they showed James Earl Jones and said well his last name's Jones
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:04.880]  he's Alex Jones his daddy he said looks nothing like Alex Jones the Kenyan dad
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:10.400]  totally different shape skull different nose you know you can tell the
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:14.480]  different African tribes by the way they look look nothing like Barack Obama who
[1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:21.760]  looks like he's about 80% white well dreams from my real father it's
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:26.740]  unbelievable and it's got shocking research and and supposedly Obama's
[1:10:26.740 --> 1:10:30.440]  mother and compromised positions and then I was thinking back wait Bill
[1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:35.240]  Clinton's mother was an admitted lady of the night and the guy they said was his
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:40.120]  dad wasn't his dad and then we know she frequented with the governor Rockefeller
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:45.120]  and then I looked into that you know 15 years ago and it was all true and then
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:49.800]  his mother dies right as he's elected Obama's mother dies right as he's
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:56.320]  elected amazing and so this is the type of people they want totally compromised
[1:10:56.320 --> 1:11:01.960]  his mother's CIA his grandmother CIA the granddaddy that's all admitted so we
[1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:06.120]  don't really know who this guy is we know his mother is who they say from my
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:10.800]  research now we have this video discounted it just came out this week
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:14.440]  at info wars.com you also get a free citizen rulebook it supports us
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:19.080]  supports the filmmaker this is a very powerful film it's available again in
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:24.280]  info warshop.com you've got to see it we're gonna for people watching on the
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:27.320]  video stream we're gonna show some side-by-side photos and things we'll
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:30.880]  describe these for radio listeners on XM and other stations out there
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:34.960]  terrestrial stations but it is powerful you got to see it because I was kind of
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:40.040]  like yeah there's some evidence I put it in and it's like whoa and caution if
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:44.440]  there's children watching they cover up the genitals and things but it is
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:50.880]  somewhat pornographic as well so just be aware of that but this is coffin nails
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:54.600]  politically to Obama and the point is even if he's a puppet he's totally
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:11:59.640]  blackmailed by foreign interest we're in grave danger ladies and gentlemen this
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:06.520]  guy is not who he says he is now the director is Joel Gilbert I'm not gonna
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:11.120]  try to even go over all of his bio but he is a contributing editor for national
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:15.080]  security and foreign policy family security matters org and appears
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:20.440]  frequently as foreign policy analyst national radio shows TV major institutes
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:24.760]  briefing councils briefing governments you name it I'm not gonna get into his
[1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:34.240]  whole bio but he joins us here today and Joel this is really scary stuff I
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:37.720]  mean I would imagine you're watching your back I'm gonna try to shut up and
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:41.200]  give you the floor but this is pretty compelling I have a lot of questions tell
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:47.480]  us about yourself how you discovered this and and your basic thesis about who
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:51.960]  this guy really is again thank you for joining us okay great to be here Alex
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:55.960]  thank you I got into this really accidentally if you look over my
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:12:59.720]  shoulder you can see on the sky I produced a film a couple years ago called
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:05.160]  atomic jihad off many of the jobs coming war and Obama's politics of defeat and
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:10.800]  when I researched that film I watched over 200 speeches of Barack Obama and I
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:15.360]  noticed something very strange every time he spoke about the rich and the poor
[1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:20.880]  he he became very excited his voice went up a full octave and he would scream
[1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:24.880]  and be so happy and then he'd go to another subject and he'd be calm again
[1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:30.360]  and that set me off to think this guy has a passion for class struggle it was
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:34.400]  very obvious but it did not fit his background I knew he went to an
[1:13:34.400 --> 1:13:39.480]  exclusive prep school he went to Harvard Law so I read his book dreams from my
[1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:45.560]  father and I saw many many references to Marxism he specifically went to
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:50.160]  Occidental College he arrived at Occidental College at age 18 admittedly
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:55.880]  as a committed revolutionary Marxist he's went into organizing he went into
[1:13:55.880 --> 1:14:02.200]  socialist conferences I realized it was a life journey in socialism so I said
[1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:06.360]  well what was his experience that he could show up at 18 years old as a
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:10.920]  Marxist he must have had a very different experience than any of the other kids
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:15.640]  at the exclusive Panahoa school so I noticed a very interesting passage in
[1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:20.240]  dreams from my father where he said that he would visit Frank Marshall Davis's
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:26.280]  house the communist propagandist with his grandfather regularly since age 10 and
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:33.120]  he said quote when I visited Frank it was as though I was witnessing some
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:39.480]  complicated unspoken transaction between Frank and my grandfather now that
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:43.960]  was pretty strange so I decided to investigate Frank Marshall Davis and
[1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:49.560]  right away you could see that Davis has a striking resemblance to Obama same
[1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:56.400]  height 6 to same forehead same eyes the jawline shocking resemblance while the
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:01.520]  Kenyan Obama looked nothing like him so I said well how could that be and that
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:06.600]  started about a two-year investigation where I dug up archives of Frank Marshall
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:11.760]  Davis from two universities that were buried I went to Hawaii and investigated
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:17.040]  Davis I found 500 copies of the Honolulu record which is a newspaper
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:23.800]  communist run newspaper that Davis wrote for and I found that Davis was not
[1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:29.200]  only the biological father of Barack Obama but also the ideological father
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:34.320]  in Davis's writings which I include a lot of those newspapers in the in the DVD
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:38.880]  he flawlessly mirrored official Soviet propaganda he was a member of the
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:43.160]  Communist Party he actually came to Hawaii he was sent to Hawaii by
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:48.080]  Communist Party USA in 1948 on the orders of the Kremlin common-term
[1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:53.960]  international to help ferment a communist takeover of the islands at that
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:59.480]  time the Russians felt that Hawaii was an obstacle to Russian expansion in Asia
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:05.640]  so Davis went to Hawaii and helped lead a communist attempt at taking over the
[1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:10.760]  government with the ILWU was the International Longshoremen's Association
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:16.160]  eventually failed but Davis went on to write in favor of socialized medicine
[1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:21.240]  he blamed America for starting World War two he denounced the Marshall plan he
[1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:29.480]  supported socialized medicine he wanted wealth redistribution so I concluded at
[1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:33.840]  that time that the people who were asking where's the birth certificate were
[1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:38.560]  asking the wrong question that the real question was who's the real father and
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:43.440]  that's the key to understanding Barack Obama's plans for the country and that's
[1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:48.360]  the key to understanding his ideology but I'm convinced and you can look at the
[1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:53.960]  film and see all the evidence that Davis is in fact the biological father and I
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:17:00.040]  found convincing evidence that Obama's mother and Dunham had an intimate
[1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:06.160]  relationship with Davis found over 30 photos of of and Dunham in various
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:10.440]  compromising states of nudity we covered everything up with black bars to be
[1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:14.760]  respectful but we show that there was an intimate relationship with Davis I
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:18.640]  actually went to the house in Hawaii there's a photo if you're on Skype and
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:24.080]  we found I took the measurements and there's and in all kind of compromising
[1:17:24.080 --> 1:17:27.960]  things but we took the measurements and found that that was the house and the
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:33.040]  photos are traced to Davis who was a amateur photographer so on the one hand
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:37.760]  there was absolutely and there is absolutely no evidence that Obama's
[1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:43.120]  mother and Dunham ever even met the Kenyan Obama no evidence they were
[1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:49.160]  married no photos nothing we have a lot of evidence of an intimate relationship
[1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:53.600]  between Frank Marshall Davis the communist propagandist and and Dunham
[1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:58.840]  Obama's mother so the whole Kenyan thing is elaborate to throw us off and make
[1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:04.040]  us think that's what's going on I believe it's all subterfuge to avoid a
[1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:09.680]  much much darker darker past then I mean let's be clear let's go back to and
[1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:13.160]  Dunham though I mean I mean it looks just like her I've blown it up these are
[1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:17.320]  not photoshopped how did you get these photos go through all that you've been
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:21.160]  to the house you've looked inside it matches the photos this is bombshell
[1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:27.560]  yeah it matches the floor it matches the photos and the photos are obvious
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:31.280]  evidence want to state one more piece of strong circumstantial evidence
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:36.760]  Davis of course is known for writing a book called sex rebel black he talks
[1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:43.520]  about 30 years of nefarious activities and sexual deviation and being
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:48.320]  interested in young girls and so on so and Dunham think about it she takes
[1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:53.920]  Barry to Indonesia for a couple years she comes back from Indonesia and tells
[1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:59.440]  the Grants Obama's grandfather something to the effect of I'm going back to
[1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:05.720]  Indonesia but you know the guy that I used to pose nude for that engaged in
[1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:10.360]  all these activities I think young Barry should be raised by him so when I go
[1:19:10.360 --> 1:19:14.240]  back to Indonesia you should take Barry to this guy's house three times a week
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:19.520]  and spend his childhood with him now that makes no sense unless Davis is the
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:25.000]  is the actual biological father let's be clear the grandpa Obama says would take
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:29.440]  him over there oh absolutely we have unbelievable I spoke to the neighbors
[1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:33.640]  former neighbors of Frank who are living and they said that Barry and they've
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:37.640]  been interviewed by other people that Barry came over at age 10 about three
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:41.880]  times a week and we have Obama himself in his book dreams from my father where
[1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:46.600]  he chronicles and talks about Frank listen it's his dad I can't believe this
[1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:50.440]  was just so big and I want to talk about where you got the photos of her in the
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:55.960]  Betty Page stuff with the other women I mean this is unbelievable this is
[1:19:55.960 --> 1:20:03.520]  unbelievable we'll be right back I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount
[1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:07.000]  of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was

[1:20:11.520 --> 1:20:16.520]  as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what
[1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:20.600]  I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great

[1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:18.400]  Dreams from my real father directed by Joel Gilbert story of reds and deception but
[1:24:18.400 --> 1:24:24.080]  again you got CIA people involved in all this it looks just like him and then
[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:27.160]  there it is because we've got dreams for our father I checked it when I got this
[1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:30.760]  video he does talk about going to his house every week and him and his
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:36.080]  grandpa having this little secret and and then it and then his mother I mean
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:40.880]  it's her in these photos let's go back to this how did you get these photos
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:47.480]  Joel these photos from several researchers who have to go on name
[1:24:47.480 --> 1:24:51.760]  they are actually folks up in San Francisco who use something called a
[1:24:51.760 --> 1:24:57.440]  usenet it's these binary photo collections of all kind of erotic
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:02.960]  photos from the Betty Page era from the the old and now they can use face scans
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:07.240]  off the photos to digitally analyze and I know you but yeah you blur the folks
[1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:10.240]  out but they're they're in the film you've got some of these sources in the
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:15.640]  film absolutely we also show that you can see the teeth of even as much as the
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:19.320]  photos look identical you can even see there's a match for the teeth and we've
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:23.960]  absolutely established both from the timeline the house the objects in the
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:28.720]  house even the couch is an exact match to the couch that Frank Marshall Davis
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:33.400]  sat on in many photos oh yeah I mean you've got them this is incredible it's
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:37.920]  Obama's dad but let me tell you what this means though people say oh that's his
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:42.400]  dad let me tell you what it means Obama's sold himself to America as the
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:47.600]  multicultural ideal he was above politics because his father was a ghost
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:51.680]  herder from Kenya so he could bring people together that's how the story
[1:25:51.680 --> 1:25:57.560]  went so people's perceived Obama as a nice man with an inspiring family story
[1:25:57.560 --> 1:26:02.920]  this film demonstrates that it is much more likely that Obama has a deeply
[1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:08.720]  disturbing family background that he hid in order to hide a Marxist political
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:14.000]  foundation if that's true which we believe it is that means there was no
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.760]  improbable love that he talked about in his convention speech we have a probable
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:25.800]  liar in the White House and a probable fordurer of documents all to hide this
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:31.040]  political foundation which is now revealing itself as a socialist Marxist
[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:36.840]  foundation that Frank Marshall Davis himself helped to nurture in Hawaii and
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:41.160]  in Chicago sure but just to be clear Frank Marshall Davis the same house the
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:45.480]  same couch he is admitted photographer writes a book about his porno you know
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:51.200]  type exploits Obama admits or Mary Cetero that his grandfather would take
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:55.120]  him over there constantly when he was a kid and then you've got the photos I
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:59.280]  mean this is open and shut this should be massive international news right now
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:05.080]  it should be it's quite disturbing that the main news outlets the cold so-called
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:09.200]  mainstream media including some conservative ones the only conservative
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:13.120]  site covering it is actually the world that daily's done a great job they even
[1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:17.120]  have a new magazine where they wish Frank Marshall Davis on their world net
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:22.040]  weekly a happy father's day because they're the only one recognizing and
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:26.840]  covering it and the reason for this is because Obama's election was not a
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:32.240]  sudden political phenomena it was the result of an American socialist movement
[1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:37.720]  that for 30 years has been quietly infiltrating the economy universities and
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:42.520]  the media such that we've gotten to the point where the so-called media is
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:47.800]  simply a extension of the Democratic Socialist Party and will not cover
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:53.320]  anything that reveals anything negative about Obama we've come to a very
[1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:59.440]  frightening state of journalism of First Amendment in this country this is
[1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:04.320]  incredible your film just came out are you authorizing folks to put this on
[1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:09.320]  access television or to have screenings if it's not for profit we're inviting
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:13.200]  people to contact us on the website to schedule screening so we can coordinate
[1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:16.800]  the screenings around the country we have someone actually who's coordinating a
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:22.600]  very large screening in Charlotte in North Carolina for the same week as the
[1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:27.480]  Republic of the Democratic Convention so we're gonna have a counter convention
[1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:30.520]  going on this should be handed out everywhere I mean I mean I would just
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:34.000]  recommend because I'm I know a little bit about viral campaigns guerrilla
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  campaigns I would call for the screenings be coordinated with presses
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:41.760]  stuff that's great but I would tell everybody to air it on access television
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:45.240]  as long as it has a link back to your website because I'm telling you access
[1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:49.000]  is one of the best secret weapons out there if you authorize people to do
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:53.520]  that if they email you they will put it on and you can reach millions because
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:56.320]  there are thousands of these channels and in the aggregate it's millions of
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:01.040]  viewers they should email us it will we will prove those one by one but you
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:04.600]  would think there are a hundred thousand journalists in this country Alex a
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:08.720]  hundred thousand you would think that one of them would want to win the public
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:12.840]  surprise all they would have to do is look at the research in this film and
[1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:17.120]  put it in a newspaper on a website and you've won the public surprise you've
[1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:21.160]  got the story of the century you showed that the president United States ran
[1:29:21.160 --> 1:29:26.240]  for president and was elected on a false background which he intentionally
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:31.560]  promoted to hide an agenda that was irreconcilable with American values this
[1:29:31.560 --> 1:29:37.720]  is the story that has to be told and that Americans should all buy the DVD and
[1:29:37.720 --> 1:29:41.240]  I mean even when he was a teenager in college all these top communists treated
[1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:45.840]  Obama like he was royalty because he was the son of their God the ultimate
[1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:52.400]  anti-American commie will be right back we're on the March the empires on the

[1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:14.800]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's

[1:31:18.840 --> 1:31:23.400]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:31:23.400 --> 1:31:27.440]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:31.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:34.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:31.760]  I've seen the film my gut tells me this is Obama's daddy and the evidence all

[1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:39.480]  State Department said it wasn't his dad and threw him out we know Obama's got
[1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:42.240]  fake social security numbers well the social security number of a dead person
[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:48.080]  the list goes on and on the film is available by Joel Gilbert dreams of my
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:55.200]  real father at info wars shop.com or by calling 888-253-3139 and he

[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:35.840]  it's in his daddy's oh it just blows me away that that he's got the same couch
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:41.080]  with his mother bending over on it he says he's goes over there when he's 10
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:45.640]  every week with his grandfather when he gets left there by his mother he's the
[1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:49.560]  top commie leader involved in the foundations that later support Obama and
[1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:53.320]  treat him like royalty when he's at Bill Ayers house when he's out of high
[1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:59.600]  school I mean this guy has absolutely been on the fast track with the commies
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:04.400]  and the big nasty globalist foundation them that are funding them I mean this
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:12.720]  is just disgusting to see this going on the voice is the same the couch with his
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:16.600]  dad Frank Marshall Davis I'm calling him his dad now sitting on it and then his
[1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:22.120]  mother all spread eagle on there with other women this just absolutely is
[1:35:22.120 --> 1:35:27.840]  devastating and it needs to get out there this is unbelievable dreams from
[1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:32.680]  my real father story of reds and deception directed by Joel Gilbert one
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:41.760]  program note I'm not doing the nightly news this week because I am I am trying
[1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:45.840]  to judge the reporter contest and make an announcement next week which I will do
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:50.840]  next Thursday maybe even earlier I've already 99% shows and you know the two
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:54.520]  reporters were gonna hire those $10,000 in prizes all the other stuff we're
[1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:59.160]  doing but I should have added there is a nightly news show every night we had
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:02.920]  like an hour-long Max Kaiser interview premiere that was shot in Europe last
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:10.760]  night a bunch of troops on the streets in Connecticut doing riot control at the
[1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:16.600]  Puerto Rico day parade we have just a lot coming up tonight as well we're
[1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:23.000]  having a lot of old reports we did best of mixed in with new breaking stuff and
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:27.560]  I'll be back Monday night it's just that we've been so busy every once in a
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:30.840]  while I'm gonna do these pit stops because once we officially launched it's
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:34.160]  already gonna picked up by some TV systems cable and also in Europe they
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:37.520]  just downloaded off the site giving them permission they edit it together and do

[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:30.880]  Gilbert maker of dreams from my real father I'm just gonna sit back for the
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:34.320]  next 10 minutes and give you the floor I'm gonna have to shut up because this is
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:37.560]  so riveting I'm gonna have to literally stick a sock in my mouth and I've got
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:41.440]  so many questions that I'm gonna open the phones up for specific questions for
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:50.680]  you okay so listen listeners it's 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 specifically
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:55.420]  for our guests Joel go ahead okay let me cover a few other important things the
[1:37:55.420 --> 1:37:59.760]  film details and chronicles a lot of evidence that of course the father is
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:04.680]  Frank Marshall Davis and what this means in terms of how Obama intentionally
[1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:09.680]  misled the public in order to get elected but the film is an entire life
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:13.640]  journey it's essentially a counter-autobiography you can just replace
[1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:18.640]  dreams from my father which is proven to be fairytale with dreams from my real
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:23.200]  father which is much much closer to the complete truth so we cover his entire
[1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:27.280]  life history and I want to point out a very important area because in this
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:32.440]  election Obama keeps talking about how he inherited a problem state of economy
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:37.920]  because of George Bush's policies or the free market policies well in fact this
[1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:43.400]  state of affairs came about primarily because of the subprime mortgage crisis
[1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:48.760]  and this started during the Clinton administration because it started actually
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:52.560]  in Chicago and guess who was in on the subprime mortgage crisis creating the
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:58.400]  foundation for it was none other than Barack Obama he lied in the debates with
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:02.880]  McCain when he said he only represented acorn for the motor voter act which was
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:07.560]  a disaster on its own because we know that 9-11 hijackers had registered to
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:12.120]  vote under motor voter as well as a lot of other voter fraud but Obama also
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:18.640]  represented acorn ensuing Citibank and he forced them to change their policies
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:24.760]  their lending policies to reduce the criteria and charge them with racism so
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:30.360]  Obama when working for Davis Minor forced Citibank to settle and lower their
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:33.760]  lending standards and then acorn warmed their way into the Clinton
[1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:37.880]  administration through Henry Cisneros and it was Clinton who ordered the
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:42.200]  lowering of lending standards across all lending institutions Fannie Mae and
[1:39:42.200 --> 1:39:47.000]  Freddie Mac that's what led to the the big crisis subprime mortgage crisis that
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:50.720]  exploded at the end of the Bush administration so it's Obama himself
[1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:56.360]  that helped start that process that we still are struggling with today the
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:00.240]  socialists decided back in the 80s and these were conferences that Obama
[1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.240]  attended these socialist scholars conferences that they would push the
[1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:09.360]  Democratic Party to the far left and force them to embrace socialism as their
[1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:14.840]  natural ideology for polarization they would polarize the society amongst
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:20.960]  black and white amongst economic classes now they have a new strategy they've
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:25.640]  stopped talking about problem-solving now Obama wants to help middle-class
[1:40:25.640 --> 1:40:30.560]  families that's his new story I have to make sure everyone understands you don't
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:35.960]  have to hardly even Google it to realize that socialist economies do not have a
[1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:41.040]  middle class they have one lower class where everybody's impoverished and the
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:45.920]  political elites control the wealth and simply consider everyone else has pawns
[1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:50.360]  so when you see Obama talking about helping the middle class he has
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:54.640]  disdain for the middle class they cling to their guns in religion and you can
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:59.480]  see that even some of the mainstream authors that are coming out like David
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:06.200]  Moranis in his book he detailed the fact that Obama's mother took him to
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:10.760]  Seattle when he was three weeks old so the public is starting to realize that
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:15.800]  Obama's original nativity story is false but they're not asking the next
[1:41:15.800 --> 1:41:22.160]  question this film not only asked the question provides the answer with a
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:27.880]  Moranis details which we all knew this for some time is that Obama's story that
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:32.000]  he had a loving family of improbable love and when his father went to Harvard
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:38.160]  when he was two years old the family broke up that's a lie we know that Obama's
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:43.680]  mother applied to move to Seattle in March of 1961 at the same time that the
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:48.280]  Kenyan Obama applied to extend his visa and for a work permit and that three
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:51.760]  weeks after Obama's birth he was in Seattle with his mother while the Kenyan
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:56.120]  Obama remained in Hawaii for one more year so knowing that this story is not
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:00.920]  true we have to start looking at well what could be true and what certainly is
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:06.840]  true is that there was no Obama family the Kenyan is not related to Barack Obama
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:10.960]  at all I don't call him Barack Obama senior because there never was a junior
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:15.480]  don't forget they called him Barack Obama the second which means another
[1:42:15.480 --> 1:42:20.280]  person if it really was the son of it would have called a junior so the Kenyan
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:25.680]  Obama is absolutely not related to the present United States and the problem is
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:31.200]  that he built his political career on this fable to hide a Marxist political
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:36.160]  foundation which is completely unacceptable to the American public we
[1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:40.040]  like everyone to again check out the film dreams for my real father and if
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:43.880]  you're on Skype you can see that there's just no resemblance to the
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:46.960]  killer we've been we've been showing the side-by-side photos and exhibits you
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:51.400]  sent us but please does someone just joined us recap the entire story for
[1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:55.880]  people and the bombshell evidence the couches matching the house the porno
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:42:59.160]  photos the Betty Page stuff with his mother
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:05.080]  Obama admitting he would go visit weekly as a child with Frank March I mean
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:09.080]  this is incredible correct they're basically by all Obama's own admission
[1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:13.720]  there is no evidence that his parents were ever married or even ever met
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:18.800]  except for a visit to Hawaii by the Kenyan Obama which I have detailed was
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:23.440]  related to a problem they were having with the scholarship to punnaha when
[1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:29.680]  Obama went to punnaha school at age 10 he went there we believe on a scholarship
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:34.800]  for affirmative action the problem was he had a white mother and a birth
[1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:39.960]  certificate that we believe said father unknown is how they left it because they
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:44.440]  couldn't show Frank Marshall Davis and the Kenyan Obama didn't want to be part
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:48.880]  of the responsibility for the child so the Kenyan Obama had to show up in
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:53.520]  Hawaii in order to get him his scholarship at punnaha but Obama admits
[1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:57.000]  that there's no evidence his parents were ever married in his book he says
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:01.680]  that even when the Kenyan Obama died he had no evidence that could show he was
[1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:07.520]  a son to make a claim on the estate we have a ton of evidence photographic
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:13.160]  circumstantial timeline witnesses in Obama's own words we have evidence of an
[1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:18.240]  intimate relationship between and done on Obama's mother and Frank Marshall Davis
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:23.640]  we have the fact that Obama admits he was partially raised by Davis and we
[1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:30.360]  have an ideological mirror between Barack Obama the president and Frank
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:36.640]  Marshall Davis's ideology that was anti-white anti-American anti-capitalism
[1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:42.120]  that is dedicated to the undermining of all the foundations of what makes
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:47.880]  America great Frank Marshall Davis was a very bitter angry communist and I
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:54.000]  believe we have the dream from his real father in the White House in the person
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:59.360]  of Barack Obama and you also show how so many of Obama's speeches are word for
[1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:03.760]  word what Davis wrote in his own communist newspaper I mean it's
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:09.320]  stunning this is his daddy you put it all together I mean it's incredible and
[1:45:09.320 --> 1:45:13.360]  you just happened to notice because of his speeches when he got excited and in
[1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:18.000]  his book up where he gets excited talking about this guy he would visit
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:21.960]  with and little hints that there was something strange when my grandfather and
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:26.480]  him why I was being taken there I mean he again criminals always hide things in
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:31.080]  plain view they they love to tell they love to leave a little nugget
[1:45:31.080 --> 1:45:35.680]  Barack Obama dropped a number of I call them breadcrumbs throughout his book
[1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:40.400]  that he alludes to the fact that this Kenyan Obama is not related to him and
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:46.600]  that Davis is the only person he refers to in his autobiography by his real name
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:54.880]  of Frank he refers to him 25 times again and again so I think this is the key
[1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:59.640]  time the voice and I mean it's him I mean you know when somebody look a lot of
[1:45:59.640 --> 1:46:03.360]  the guys that work here have sons and you see their sons they look like them
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:07.040]  they act like them I mean you can tell when somebody's their daddy I mean you
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:10.880]  see my dad sitting next to me he looks just like me except he's got brown hair
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:15.760]  or not you know dirty blonde hair I mean the age spots if you look at Obama's
[1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:21.480]  age spots coming out all over his face identical to Davis Obama is left-handed
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:26.840]  as is Davis they are literal mirrors of each other and Obama has dropped us
[1:46:26.840 --> 1:46:30.080]  little breadcrumbs but I get emails from people again and again who got
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:35.680]  advanced copies and they say thank you this is the first cohesive understanding
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:40.800]  where all these little things that just weren't right all that's exactly and
[1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:45.240]  that's just how this info operation works is that they throw out they have
[1:46:45.240 --> 1:46:48.720]  her say in speeches when he was campaigning we went back to where he
[1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:54.320]  was born Kenya they have it it's all obvious Hillary puts it out that oh he
[1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:59.280]  wasn't really born here so everybody follows that knowing the whole time it's
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:06.000]  unbelievable it's unbelievable well I when I was making the film I was very
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:10.720]  careful not to reveal any of the content until it was finished now that it's out
[1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:15.840]  there I think Americans finally have a chance to understand the real agenda of
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:20.940]  Barack Obama and it is not problem-solving and fair play it is
[1:47:20.940 --> 1:47:26.040]  undermining the capitalist system and doing away with the foundation of
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:32.680]  America's greatness and exceptionalism to reduce America to a weak power in the
[1:47:32.680 --> 1:47:36.960]  world and well exactly I mean Bush and all these guys are bad but but I mean
[1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:42.560]  Obama 20 billion to ship General Motors to China Obama carbon to everything a
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:47.480]  foreign saboteur couldn't do this good of a job destroying this country well
[1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:52.280]  unfortunately this is where we are today and if we didn't have such a corrupt
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:58.360]  media and a complete lack of truth in the Democratic Party every time I listen
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:03.520]  to any Democrat there's a hundred percent blind blind support for Obama's
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:09.360]  agenda with total dishonesty look at how he's giving Libya and Syria to Al Qaeda
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:15.360]  he is not stupid he knows for instance that if you run up trillions and
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:20.040]  trillions in deficit he knows this will bankrupt and ruin the United States he
[1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:23.480]  knows this I want to play clip I'm gonna come back this is this is with phone
[1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:26.600]  calls keep you five minutes the next hour if you can do it we got Lord Monta
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:30.040]  coming up from the UN confab where they're openly calling for world
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:34.720]  government the end of capitalism but communism doesn't exist this is Obama's
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:39.320]  mentor one of Americans put in reeducation camps and killed this is Larry
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:44.920]  Grathwall at the highest levels of the underground with the weathermen with
[1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:49.760]  Bill Ayers how they were gonna kill us in the camps here it is I brought up the
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:54.400]  subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government you know we
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:49:00.120]  we become responsible then for administrating you know 250 million
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:08.200]  people and there was no answers no one had given any thought to economics how
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:12.480]  are you gonna clothe and feed these people the only thing that I could get
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:16.600]  was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:21.240]  and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:25.840]  States they also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:31.000]  protect against what they called the counter-revolution and they felt that
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:36.760]  this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:43.360]  establishing reeducation centers in the Southwest where we would take all the
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:49.320]  people who needed to be reeducated into the new way of thinking and teach them
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:54.200]  how things were going to be I asked well what is going to happen to those
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:50:01.000]  people that we can't reeducate that are diehard capitalists and the reply was
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:05.720]  that they'd have to be eliminated and when I pursued this further they
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:10.280]  estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:16.200]  reeducation centers and when I say eliminate I mean kill 25 million people
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:23.200]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:31.880]  graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers and
[1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:38.360]  hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:44.880]  dead serious oh what's the document I got two months ago the army confirmed
[1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:51.240]  reeducation camps have been set up that's an info wars calm we're gonna come
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:55.080]  back with our guests and your calls Joel Gilbert dreams of my real father
[1:50:55.080 --> 1:51:02.640]  available at info warshop.com stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know
[1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:06.240]  that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:10.160]  vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:13.640]  seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:17.000]  outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:20.760]  could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put
[1:51:20.760 --> 1:51:25.480]  together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:30.080]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your
[1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:33.720]  family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified

[1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:43.320]  ahead go ahead concept you're on the air from from New York yes just to give you
[1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:46.680]  an idea of who I am I was at the Bilderberg protest with the boombox and
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:49.360]  the microphone you remember me on yes I remember meeting you sir you have a
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:53.120]  question for our guest good to get us to talk to it's actually more of a
[1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:58.640]  comment just from reading bloodlines of the Illuminati how all the presidents
[1:54:58.640 --> 1:55:04.960]  are linked to bloodlines of ancient rulers of the world I just want to make
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:12.080]  a comment that you know his illigitimacy is definitely a compromise because they
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:17.480]  want to keep him on a short leash and if he doesn't go with the program am I
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:23.160]  still on there yes sir man I'm really trying to look yeah anyways they want to
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:27.560]  keep him on a short leash so that if he does go against their program they can
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:31.880]  just say oh he wasn't legitimate and then make everything that he's done no
[1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:36.520]  and void I also want to make the comment that if we the reason why we don't
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:40.880]  really know who his family are is that he's not really our first African
[1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:46.520]  American president because he's not lineage that goes back to slavery you
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:50.120]  know I mean there's all right listen I hear you do you have any comments on
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:55.880]  that my comment is the the main risk we're looking at is things that have to
[1:55:55.880 --> 1:55:59.640]  do with blackmail from other governments if I could figure this out
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:03.720]  simply by asking the right question once I asked the right question who's the
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:09.000]  real father I found the information so when I saw that video of Obama leaning
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:14.600]  over to Medvedev and he said after the election I'll be more flexible and then
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:20.320]  Medvedev said I'll tell Vladimir that made my skin crawl because Putin former
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:25.880]  KGB head he must know all of this as do many other intelligence agencies we know
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:29.480]  the United States lost its manufacturing industries it's suspected
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:35.480]  because Obama not Obama Clinton gave the Chinese the most favorite nation
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:40.920]  status in the 90s and the Panama Canal it just gets worse real fast bill in
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:46.680]  California you're on the air go ahead hi Alex I Joel my question is this I've
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:52.440]  read Jerome Corsi's book The Obamination a good book and if it turns out that
[1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:56.760]  Davis is the father how do you see Joel how do you see your research
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:56:59.880]  complimenting Jerome Corsi's research because the question book is written
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:03.080]  under the assumption that Kenyan Obama was the father well that's the thing I
[1:57:03.080 --> 1:57:07.000]  mean Corsi now is changing his whole thing he knows Obama isn't who they
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:10.840]  said but now he understands because he worked in intelligence that this was an
[1:57:10.840 --> 1:57:16.320]  elaborate fraud within a fraud within a fraud that's standard procedure at these
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:21.040]  levels and I mean Corsi believes that what has been developed by Joel is
[1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:27.360]  accurate yeah Corsi and I have discussed all of this several times we were doing
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:32.840]  some joint research and we shared some research and he concurs with me at this
[1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:37.920]  point that Davis is the most likely father and even for anyone you can look
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:42.520]  at the video and it's so obvious the time it's ridiculous everybody it's his
[1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:46.200]  dad you can look at him the voice he hung out with him as a kid
[1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:50.520]  even beyond that it's the film demonstrates throughout the whole his
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:54.880]  whole life story that Davis is his ideological father which is even more
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:59.800]  dangerous than the biology but the mannerisms it's his dad anything else
[1:57:59.800 --> 1:58:04.720]  shall build that was all thanks for taking my call thank you let's jam in one
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:09.320]  more and he can answer when we come back Damien in South Carolina go ahead yes
[1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:16.680]  Mr. Gilbert my one question is this we who believe what's going on here is to
[1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:20.080]  be true is what you're talking about often me Republicans Democrats fellow
[1:58:20.080 --> 1:58:23.240]  Americans who just feel like oh you're a birther or you're a truth there on the
[1:58:23.240 --> 1:58:27.400]  9-11 issue whatever what is the one fact that we can just throw in their face
[1:58:27.400 --> 1:58:31.420]  like a silver bullet that will make them believe what is his mother doing on

[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:16.480]  or info warshop.com or 888-253-3139 we only got about four or five minutes
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:21.920]  left what is the most what do you say was my just as birther I mean how do you
[2:01:21.920 --> 2:01:24.880]  respond to that I mean first they said his name wasn't Barry Cetero now they
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:28.800]  admit that the records are sealed you know I mean they're constant they're
[2:01:28.800 --> 2:01:33.320]  covering something up you have stumbled right into it hiding in plain view what
[2:01:33.320 --> 2:01:38.720]  do you say to somebody well I tell them it's so convoluted what Obama has
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:42.720]  created it's impossible to say one little fact toy that's why I put the film
[2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:47.680]  together as a 90-minute full Obama history where you can see how the story
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:53.360]  all puts together so what I tell people is simply Obama is taking you for a
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:01:58.800]  fool the socialists they use black people they use the middle class and they
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:03.240]  discard them later after they wage their war against the middle class and
[2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:07.960]  against any chance that minorities have of being successful by eliminating
[2:02:07.960 --> 2:02:13.240]  socialist leaders are always you Genesis that hate black people well Obama just
[2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:18.120]  like Frank Marshall Davis was in charge of recruiting blacks to the Communist
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:22.680]  Party in Chicago and Hawaii and he was rejected didn't work very well because
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:26.200]  blacks were religious people they rejected communism because it was
[2:02:26.200 --> 2:02:31.000]  atheist Obama went into these communist organizations in Chicago as an
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:36.080]  organizer to recruit black people because they thought a frontman with a
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:39.680]  black face could succeed where the communists had failed that's what
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:42.720]  Margaret Sanger said she said we got a higher blacks poses liberals to kill
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:47.720]  these weeds let's take a quick call here let's talk to Julio in Illinois in
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:54.120]  Chicago speaking of the the Chicago mob Julio you're on the air yes this all
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:56.960]  makes sense Joe we all have to have prayers for this man this is
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:00.480]  unbelievable I'm shocked I'm still shocked at hearing that weather underground
[2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:05.760]  comment but anyway this all makes sense you talk about Marshall's you know sex
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:11.240]  craze you know sex rebel book and Obama's mother and her escapades a
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:15.480]  very tutorial has the same type of tendencies here in Chicago with Rahm
[2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:20.800]  Emmanuel the down low club and man's country and I just have a question Joe
[2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:24.480]  how can I get in contact with you to set up a screening here in the second
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:30.960]  by the way I know Julio he is a reporter so I guess you just email Joel

[2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:41.040]  screening request or check all the different press reviews are up there

[2:03:57.080 --> 2:04:01.700]  question go how do you think Obama's ideological background fits into his
[2:04:01.700 --> 2:04:06.240]  global globalist agenda of being a being on the UN Security Council on
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:09.360]  going to war at the behest of the United Nations yeah what do you make of that
[2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:15.480]  like putting our military under UN command well Obama as communism is a
[2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:22.040]  universalist ideology as is Islamism they there's a nexus between Islamism
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:26.800]  and communism and Marxism they both believe that American capitalism is
[2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:31.320]  an enemy that has to be destroyed so by putting the United States at the behest
[2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:36.040]  of the UN is part of the internationalist agenda all right we're gonna
[2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:40.640]  have to get you back on next week to talk about this Joel Gilbert the film

[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:34.000]  with the last interview that we had the next 40 minutes or so Lord Christopher
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:39.120]  Monkton joins us from Rio de Janeiro via video Skype while it holds up he's got
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:42.480]  breaking news here's we're gonna write to him then I'm gonna have my review of
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:48.320]  the new New World Order propaganda police state rise of the dark night we've got
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:52.280]  the spoilers all of it and not too many spoilers but that's coming up in a
[2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:56.600]  special presentation to very end of the show today on the Friday edition I'll
[2:08:56.600 --> 2:09:05.000]  be back this Sunday or to 6 p.m. Central live on the Sunday show now Lord
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:10.760]  Christopher Monkton is the head of science public policy dot org he was a
[2:09:10.760 --> 2:09:15.000]  top advisor Margaret Thatcher he's an inventor he's also run some of the
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:19.640]  biggest newspapers in England so he's also a journalist and he is the guy
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:24.160]  that's broken I'd say more than anybody the big stories on the fascistic
[2:09:24.160 --> 2:09:28.600]  control freak nature of the fake greens ignoring all the real environmental
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:33.320]  issues and they're there believe me and just making it a total takeover of
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:38.240]  society with carbon taxes the rest of it he's got big breaking news now and they
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:42.000]  have video that they're breaking here they're gonna show you and describe for
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:48.240]  radio listeners of just the lavish fashion shows caviar all of it you know
[2:09:48.240 --> 2:09:52.320]  the Eve the Eve the carbon footprint these pigs let all of them living off
[2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:55.720]  our tax money while they want you to die which is what the UN does everywhere
[2:09:55.720 --> 2:10:01.320]  their whole agenda is death ladies and gentlemen we're gonna talk about that with
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:05.480]  Lord Monkton joining us from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where they've
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:10.920]  painted Christ green and literally going full bore with a religion to give us
[2:10:10.920 --> 2:10:15.040]  the report thank you so much for joining us sir it's a real pleasure with you
[2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:20.680]  Alex and just on that statue of Christ standing high over rear did know the
[2:10:20.680 --> 2:10:27.800]  iconic symbol of the city built in 1888 and for the first time instead of
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:34.560]  appearing as glorious glittering white marble it's a lurid green color however
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:38.760]  the Almighty has a sense of humor and for the last few days throughout the
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:45.000]  conference there has been low cloud and heavy rain so that this lurid green
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:51.520]  statue has been almost entirely invisible from anywhere in Rio I'll tell
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:55.240]  you it's like the green horse of apocalypse a pestilence or whatever
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:11:00.120]  this is ridiculous of course they have a statue there too in Brazil and in their
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:04.360]  capital of Prince Charles is as the Christ saving them with his
[2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:09.080]  environmental lordship but but Lord Monkton let's continue here what I know
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:12.120]  you've got a lot of breaking news tell us what you've seen the last few days
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:18.520]  there I think the most significant thing having been to many UN conferences as
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:24.560]  an official delegate to a non-government organization over the years is that
[2:11:24.560 --> 2:11:28.520]  delegates from non-government organizations such as the one that I'm
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:32.120]  with here which is the committee for a constructive tomorrow a responsible
[2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:37.480]  and sensible environmental group and we have now for the first time ever been
[2:11:37.480 --> 2:11:43.280]  excluded from sitting in on the official plenary sessions where the
[2:11:43.280 --> 2:11:47.640]  negotiations are actually going on we are not allowed access to the world's
[2:11:47.640 --> 2:11:54.000]  news media either we aren't even allowed to see copies of each successive draft
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:58.720]  of the negotiating text the last one we saw was the one that came out before the
[2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:04.960]  conference even began and so this censorship by the UN is something new
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:08.280]  and Alex I think I know
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:14.600]  all right we lost him there also sponsored by the UN not so long ago
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:20.280]  and there too I was they tried to ban me from the conference but I got in that
[2:12:20.280 --> 2:12:24.480]  time I got a copy of the negotiating document and revealed it to the world
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:29.360]  as a result of which within 24 hours half of the document which contained all
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:34.040]  the lunatic proposals that I had expressed had been dropped and the UN
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:38.560]  doesn't want that humiliation again so it has decided that in this so-called
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:44.720]  transparent conference in fact nobody is allowed anywhere near the negotiating
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:48.600]  delegates no one is allowed to see the working documents of the conference
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:55.360]  until the conclusions are merely handed down to us on high at the end
[2:12:55.360 --> 2:12:59.960]  we've been showing a video that we're going to show from front to finish you're
[2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:07.560]  breaking here from science and public policy.org of the lavish parties the
[2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:15.080]  runway models the the caviar you know the giant jets coming in I mean this is
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:21.800]  quite this makes a secret service orgy look tame well it is extremely lavish
[2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:28.480]  for instance Richard Branson flew in here on one of his own planes huge carbon
[2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:34.080]  footprint there and his minders on seeing me in the room made him walk three
[2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:37.720]  quarters of the way the long way around the room so that he didn't end up
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:42.360]  running into me and having to talk to me David Suzuki the environmental freak
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:47.920]  he is here too I took him by the hand and he dived away by the way he calls
[2:13:47.920 --> 2:13:53.760]  humans maggots he ran away because he didn't want to talk to me or be
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:59.920]  photographed shaking my hand these people are running scared they know Alex
[2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:04.800]  that it's all over they know that the world has become cynical and breaking
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:10.760]  news here if you like last week we sent spies in they do it to us so now we're
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:16.360]  doing it to them spies to go into the meeting of the international local
[2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:21.160]  government group called Italy which is implementing secretly on the ground in
[2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:25.600]  various places including the United States the measures of the so-called
[2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:30.000]  agenda 21 environmental thing which means effectively closing down in the
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.520]  west and these people said among themselves they didn't realize we were
[2:14:34.520 --> 2:14:39.240]  listening but they're encouraging each other no longer to use the word
[2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:44.040]  environment no longer to talk about climate change because they said to each
[2:14:44.040 --> 2:14:49.040]  other we know now that the people are not buying this message anymore we'll
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:52.920]  have to think of something else and what this means Alex is that we are
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:58.920]  winning and further breaking news on this the pre-session draft that's the
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:02.760]  session that's the draft of the negotiating text at this conference that
[2:15:02.760 --> 2:15:07.960]  was produced before the conference even began by the various beavering away
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:12.640]  working groups of pointy-headed leftists that put these things together
[2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:18.680]  start out with an admission that the world's most serious problem is not
[2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:24.960]  climate change it's poverty so they've now abandoned fish officially right at
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:29.360]  the top the whole climate storyline of course there's still waffle about it in
[2:15:29.360 --> 2:15:35.480]  the main text but it's no longer described as the most serious problems it
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:40.280]  always was in all previous UN conferences now now of course sir you
[2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:45.040]  you've broken down the numbers here but tell people briefly what would happen if
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:48.960]  they were able to put their carbon taxes in because yes we've defeated them on
[2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:53.040]  the surface which is a devastating victory another wonderful victory and
[2:15:53.040 --> 2:15:57.000]  and and they're imploding as you've chronicled and help to help you engage
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:02.040]  in but they're still implementing by stealth and at a state and city level
[2:16:02.040 --> 2:16:06.440]  as Schwarzenegger said they would do leading their attack flotilla three
[2:16:06.440 --> 2:16:10.800]  years ago in Copenhagen and they have gone with that strategy so what's going
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:13.800]  well I guess you don't know fully what's going on because they barge you but I
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:18.960]  know you have spies inside well that's right we were able to get into the the
[2:16:18.960 --> 2:16:23.760]  equally group meeting last week and they told us everything because they thought
[2:16:23.760 --> 2:16:29.240]  we were part of them they didn't realize we were in fact not part of them and so
[2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:34.080]  they were very track that they wanted to fool the people by using the
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:38.200]  environment as an excuse but they were no longer willing to use the word
[2:16:38.200 --> 2:16:41.480]  environment they're no longer willing even to use the word green it's now
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:45.760]  hated by the majority of the voters and instead and they're no longer talking
[2:16:45.760 --> 2:16:50.520]  about climate change either because they have now realized that the public have
[2:16:50.520 --> 2:16:55.000]  seen right through this nonsense and that if they were to go on using that
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:59.680]  language then ultimately they would completely lose the argument if indeed
[2:16:59.680 --> 2:17:04.080]  they haven't completely lost it already so what is happening of course is that
[2:17:04.080 --> 2:17:08.240]  around the world there are these local authorities at local government level
[2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:15.040]  trying to put into effect what the UN wants which is the instruments of
[2:17:15.040 --> 2:17:20.200]  effectively global government interfering at a local level that's what it
[2:17:20.200 --> 2:17:27.400]  is all about and anyone who believes in democracy ought to be concerned about
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:32.960]  this and worried that they are no longer willing to speak honestly and that's why
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:37.320]  they won't use the environment anymore they won't use the word green but
[2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:42.640]  they're being dishonest with us what they really want is absolute totalitarian
[2:17:42.640 --> 2:17:46.080]  power and we're gonna break down what else you've learned I just made an error
[2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:51.320]  because you're your your office get pointed the video out to us I misunderstood
[2:17:51.320 --> 2:17:55.920]  the crew the video of them lavishing themselves with the runway models and
[2:17:55.920 --> 2:17:59.200]  the caviar and the champagne is from and of course you would know this because
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:03.760]  you're in Rio see fact dot org I've seen some of their other videos they're
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:09.120]  doing a great job that's another group I need to get on the show see I am here
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:13.120]  as a representative of the committee for construction so so we were corrected
[2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:17.400]  okay that's why your crew gave it to us yes okay good absolutely these are my
[2:18:17.400 --> 2:18:21.720]  team here and I am part of their team if you like and they are okay that's where
[2:18:21.720 --> 2:18:24.800]  the confusion is I was told here's Lord Moncton's footage we're breaking it and
[2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:29.440]  so now I understand so we are correct it really is you know the wonderful job
[2:18:29.440 --> 2:18:32.280]  let's just move on from that now what else do you know we're about to go to
[2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:36.640]  break what else what else is breaking there so the most important thing is
[2:18:36.640 --> 2:18:43.560]  that there's a feeling of absolute alarm here a gloom on the part of the usual
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:48.840]  suspects they've got children as it propagandized children they're
[2:18:48.840 --> 2:18:53.160]  exploiting and they've got them to do posters showing the Sun dressed up as a
[2:18:53.160 --> 2:18:58.160]  doctor talking to planet Earth and saying the disease that you've got is
[2:18:58.160 --> 2:19:03.760]  humans in other words little children are being taught by these left-wing
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:09.400]  extremists wow that humans are a poison on the planet and should be wiped out it
[2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:14.800]  is it couldn't get more serious than that and I think that's what they do is
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:20.240]  they push this idea that humans are disease but now they're brutalizing
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:23.480]  children with this to wreck their self-image I've been told of Austin
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:28.280]  children in in in first grade or kindergarten crying when they come home
[2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:33.640]  because they're filthy devil humans this is child abuse it is exactly that
[2:19:33.640 --> 2:19:38.760]  it is illegal in Britain to do that to children and it ought to be illegal in
[2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:44.280]  the United States too so if any parents are listening to this or watching this
[2:19:44.280 --> 2:19:49.240]  and have heard their children being propagandized in this way then they
[2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:55.040]  should complain to the police about child abuse because that is you're quite
[2:19:55.040 --> 2:19:58.600]  right Alex that's exactly what oh it's the worst time they're telling children
[2:19:58.600 --> 2:20:03.240]  they're crud they're murdering the earth for a long time we talk about building

[2:24:24.440 --> 2:24:33.440]  all right Lord Montyn is our guest with breaking news and he's there working
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:37.720]  with the great folks of and seeing their videos at cfact.org he's working with
[2:24:37.720 --> 2:24:44.520]  that organization and tell us what else you're discovering and finding because
[2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:49.240]  ladies and gentlemen when I get up here and I say it's child abuse to tell five
[2:24:49.240 --> 2:24:54.280]  and six year olds humans are scum I saw an ABC News of Australia look it up
[2:24:54.280 --> 2:24:59.440]  they have a video game they make the kids play at school where little pigs and
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:03.880]  chickens and goats and cows have their heads chopped off and blood sprays this
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:08.840]  is seven and eight year olds when the humans take up too much carbon and then
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:18.560]  humans though can kill themselves now suicide is exploding promiscuity is off
[2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:24.440]  the charts with the diseases and the abortions people don't care about
[2:25:24.440 --> 2:25:28.240]  themselves anymore on average they don't care what the government's doing this
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:32.320]  is large segments who buy into the hype a lot of people just buy into hype they
[2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:37.000]  do whatever they're told I have talked to mothers at homeschooling group
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:41.640]  meetings who took their children out professionals doctors lawyers because
[2:25:41.640 --> 2:25:44.120]  one mother starts telling it the other dad starts telling it why they took them
[2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:48.000]  out of public school because they'd have their six or seven year old some cases
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:53.520]  five-year-old at Austin public schools this is all over the country and they
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:25:56.480]  tell them you're killing the earth you're hurting things so when they drive
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:26:02.400]  by a housing development or something the little girls cry and wretch and say
[2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:07.800]  I'm killing bunnies ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen these people are
[2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:13.200]  the scum of the earth they want control of all the research all the resources
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:17.520]  board Monkton what do you do about this level of criminal filth that have turned
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:23.320]  the schools into reeducation camps now the first thing to do is to do your best
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:30.360]  to try to get real hard evidence from inside your child's classroom of what
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:35.760]  is being said to your child there are various ways you can do this get in
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:39.360]  touch with your local homeschooling group that's three million children the
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:42.400]  states now educated by homeschooling groups so they're free of this
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:48.360]  propaganda but they will tell you how to find out what is going on in your
[2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:53.560]  child's school what is being said to your child what kind of threats and
[2:26:53.560 --> 2:26:58.560]  bullying is going on in the name of saving the planet as you know as the
[2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:01.640]  planet was trying to be saved two thousand years ago it doesn't need to be
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:07.600]  saved again but this is this propaganda that humans are a disease on the earth
[2:27:07.600 --> 2:27:12.880]  this propaganda which is being spread by images drawn by propagandized children
[2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:18.120]  here at the Rio conference this is and your phrase is absolutely correct it is
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:22.480]  child abuse but you need to get if you're a parent the hardest possible
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:28.880]  evidence of what is being said and then you need to go to your local police or
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:35.880]  FBI and make a formal complaint because it is a criminal offense to abuse
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:42.120]  children and the abuse can be mental as well as physical and this is mental
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:47.640]  abuse of children if they're reduced to tears by these appalling foolish stories
[2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:53.160]  about how humans are killing the planet and you need to go and report it and go
[2:27:53.160 --> 2:27:57.640]  on reporting it until somebody in the public services does his job
[2:27:57.640 --> 2:28:02.920]  investigates and arrests these teachers and sends just one or two of them to
[2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:08.240]  jail that's all it will take and the rest of them will run for cover and will
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:13.480]  not dare to try to pedal this sort of propaganda to six and seven year olds
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:18.480]  ever again it is disgusting again your word Alex and you're absolutely right
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:25.040]  children have the right to the innocence of their childhood they
[2:28:25.040 --> 2:28:30.720]  should not be exploited by the hard Marxist left among the teaching
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:35.760]  profession and the way to stop them is to find out very carefully exactly what
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:39.800]  is being said to your children and then if what is being said is something that
[2:28:39.800 --> 2:28:44.680]  you think amounts to mental abuse of your children do not take it lying down
[2:28:44.680 --> 2:28:48.640]  you should say a complaint to the head teacher and if you don't get
[2:28:48.640 --> 2:28:53.760]  satisfaction there then complain and remember the teacher that said if you
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:58.000]  criticize Obama you'll be arrested and we have the tape two years ago of Al
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:02.520]  Gorda a group of middle school students at elementary saying your parents are
[2:29:02.520 --> 2:29:08.440]  wrong you go tell them to support the carbon taxes right now I'm sure you heard
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:15.000]  that is illegal in Britain he could be taken to court for that if it happened
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:20.320]  in Britain in America thanks to the right of free speech you can even say
[2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:25.800]  that kind of thing to children and get away tell folks you got his his film
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:31.400]  removed from schools proving it was a fraud what we did it was we got them in
[2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:35.720]  order that they could show it in schools they had to send 77 pages of
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:39.760]  corrective guidance around so they had to stop showing it in effect yeah
[2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:43.600]  exactly stay there other tidbits of what's happening at this criminal

[2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:15.480]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true

[2:32:19.560 --> 2:32:23.400]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:32:23.400 --> 2:32:27.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:30.840]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:32:30.840 --> 2:32:34.200]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their

[2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:23.480]  okay lord moccain we've only got about seven minutes left till we go
[2:33:23.480 --> 2:33:26.680]  our next report really appreciate you joining us from rio
[2:33:26.680 --> 2:33:30.840]  obviously next week or in the aftermath you can give us the full data dump
[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:35.560]  the fact that they're not releasing their agenda and their plan shows that they
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:38.840]  are cratering what do you expect them to do now a
[2:33:38.840 --> 2:33:43.560]  b what are other pieces of intel you've been able to glean there
[2:33:43.560 --> 2:33:48.920]  on the brazilian coast i think the most important thing is that because they
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:55.400]  have withheld each new draft of this document as it is negotiated
[2:33:55.400 --> 2:33:58.920]  they are plainly frightened that we would do to them what we did to them at
[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:02.920]  durban and at copenhagen which is to reveal the sheer
[2:34:02.920 --> 2:34:06.680]  nonsense that that the negotiators have been putting into these
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:10.680]  drafts so that when the public laughs at them worldwide they have to drop it from
[2:34:10.680 --> 2:34:13.320]  the draft this time they want to keep it all secret
[2:34:13.320 --> 2:34:17.160]  right until the end of the conference and then announce that all the draft
[2:34:17.160 --> 2:34:21.080]  including all the silly things they they had to take out at durban they're now
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:24.440]  trying to put them back in again uh has been accepted
[2:34:24.440 --> 2:34:28.760]  and is therefore de facto it's all done that nothing anyone can do about it
[2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:32.600]  that's their strategy it is going to fail because
[2:34:32.600 --> 2:34:38.520]  with cfact.tv and cfact.org with whom i am on this trip
[2:34:38.520 --> 2:34:44.280]  we will be producing the most detailed and factually based analysis of the
[2:34:44.280 --> 2:34:48.440]  final document when it eventually emerges that is available
[2:34:48.440 --> 2:34:52.120]  anywhere and you will then have the chance to get on to your politicians
[2:34:52.120 --> 2:34:56.360]  in particular in the united states your senators in case they try to get any new
[2:34:56.360 --> 2:35:00.280]  treaty through based on this document and say to them
[2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:05.080]  there is no legitimate basis for any treaty
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:08.120]  based on anything coming out of the conference here in rio
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:11.720]  we will provide you with the detailed ammunition
[2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:15.960]  we will send it to you for posting at info wars.com
[2:35:15.960 --> 2:35:20.680]  so that you have the details as well and you can of course get all our reports
[2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:26.200]  from cfact.tv and cfact.org and if you want to take part in our
[2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:30.280]  petition to world leaders telling them to pay no attention
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:33.720]  to the marxists and pointy heads assembled in large numbers
[2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:39.640]  here in rio then please go on to cfact.org and make sure you vote in that
[2:35:39.640 --> 2:35:45.400]  petition you can participate if you will participate and help us in this way
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:48.920]  this will make sure that the message gets through
[2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:53.000]  to our political leaders that we will not take this lying down
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:56.600]  we will not allow negotiations in a democratic countries
[2:35:56.600 --> 2:36:00.840]  to take place behind closed doors of these international gatherings
[2:36:00.840 --> 2:36:05.000]  we will not allow this obsessive secrecy but the rule is very simple
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:10.280]  if they have if they only hide something if they've got something to hide
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:13.960]  and they're hiding the entire negotiating text
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:19.240]  that means they are running scared scared of the few people here who like me
[2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:22.840]  have seen through this nonsense and are not going to let them get away
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:27.240]  now undoubtedly you've got moles sneaking around
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:31.960]  and i mean oh hopefully hackers don't get in like last time
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:35.720]  and and and get to climate emails who they admit it's all a big scam
[2:36:35.720 --> 2:36:39.080]  i mean i've got a feeling how long is the conference running
[2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:42.760]  i've got a gut feeling we're going to end up getting a leak
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:46.440]  the conference is due to finish today whereupon of course the
[2:36:46.440 --> 2:36:50.040]  text should be available but as you know elix the way they
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:54.040]  script these things for the left-wing media and that means nearly all the
[2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:57.960]  media is that they always go into an extra day or
[2:36:57.960 --> 2:37:02.280]  two and then at four in the morning a day or two after the conference should
[2:37:02.280 --> 2:37:05.640]  have ended they emerge with their ties around their ears
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:09.880]  and their hair all in a mess and their unshaven faces
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:15.000]  and a one smile on their face and saying that we've done it we've reached
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:18.920]  agreement the general feeling so far
[2:37:18.920 --> 2:37:23.560]  among the left is that they're not going to get what they want even behind closed
[2:37:23.560 --> 2:37:26.760]  doors they're not going to succeed in getting what they want but of course
[2:37:26.760 --> 2:37:31.480]  they will declare it a victory anyway as they always do
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:35.240]  but we will be telling you in detail what the truth
[2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:39.320]  is about what they've decided we will summarize the long
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:43.400]  turgid document that comes out we will explain for instance the capacity
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:46.040]  building when you see that phrase means creating
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:50.520]  enormous bureaucracies which become permanent and start acting as leeches on
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:54.040]  the taxpayers we will explain all the un gobbledygook
[2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:58.200]  so that you understand that what is really being done here
[2:37:58.200 --> 2:38:01.640]  is yet another attempt to turn the united nations
[2:38:01.640 --> 2:38:05.480]  into a world government i've been shoved aside
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:10.040]  by un goons here just the other a couple of nights ago i was dining at a
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:13.160]  fashionable restaurant standing outside waiting for my car
[2:38:13.160 --> 2:38:16.760]  and up comes the dictator of rwanda surrounded by
[2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:20.200]  wagons full of un goons one of them gets out and pushes me
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:23.880]  into the rose bushes nearby so the dictator could walk
[2:38:23.880 --> 2:38:26.920]  unencumbered into the restaurant this is the
[2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:30.280]  un regime we are all going to have to know and hate
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:35.000]  as it evolves they are becoming more arrogant as they get more money and
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:38.600]  power from the un's member states and again all around the world if you're
[2:38:38.600 --> 2:38:42.200]  watching this there is one thing you could really do to help here
[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:46.680]  that is to get your local member of parliament or congress
[2:38:46.680 --> 2:38:51.960]  to ask an official question about how much money is paid by your country
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:57.000]  to the un the un ipcc the un the framework convention on
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.640]  so they can fly around constantly guzzling alcohol partying
[2:39:01.640 --> 2:39:05.320]  uh prostitutes that comes out i mean it is incredible
[2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:09.080]  ask your parliamentaries to find out how much this is costing
[2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:13.000]  because in britain we are drawing up plans in the united kingdom independence
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:17.560]  party to leave the un there's no long before
[2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:21.640]  coming to this organization and and we are moving towards it's not yet
[2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:25.480]  settled but we're moving towards the idea that we should leave the un
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:28.520]  as switzerland's already done they've never played any part in it
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:33.160]  just come out and stop paying it is look look the un has been caught as you
[2:39:33.160 --> 2:39:34.920]  know even in the new york times admits it
[2:39:34.920 --> 2:39:38.600]  lining people up in africa and latin america and shooting them to take their
[2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:41.160]  property lord montan thank you so much and we'll get a
[2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:44.840]  debriefing from you when you get back to the uk thank you so much

[2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:00.200]  hyperbole when we talk about how evil they are
[2:40:00.200 --> 2:40:03.320]  they have countless publications and i want to see this new one where they
[2:40:03.320 --> 2:40:07.080]  tell children they're evil you're a parasite you're scum
[2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:11.880]  we've shown you the cartoons and other things

[2:40:32.440 --> 2:40:36.120]  again ladies and gentlemen very important to expose what the united
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:40.680]  nations is up to it is absolutely imperative
[2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:45.960]  that we become aware of this and that we expose them
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:53.800]  everywhere i go i see propaganda
[2:40:54.920 --> 2:40:58.920]  i'll just get up and get it yeah i needed water earlier i just

[2:41:07.880 --> 2:41:13.080]  it's over oh there we go i basically drank
[2:41:13.080 --> 2:41:18.920]  tabasco ladies and gentlemen uh i mean it's like salt now for me but
[2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:22.520]  we're gonna have to obviously skip the network break coming up stations out
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:26.520]  there should not be running over this speaking of wonderful stations let me
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:29.960]  give you a plug uh just this week we've gotten two new
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:35.240]  affiliates wgpa allentown pennsylvania
[2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:39.880]  and the biggest station in noxville we've been on outside noxville wbcr for
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:43.240]  more than a decade they're great folks weekdays but they're picking up sunday
[2:41:43.240 --> 2:41:49.000]  show on wnox 100 000 watt fm so very very exciting
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:52.600]  wnox and wgpa very thankful to all the great
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:41:55.480]  affiliates we're getting a couple new affiliates every week
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:42:01.320]  now the show is exploding and there you have it wnox 100.3
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:05.160]  wow front page uh front page promotion there we just went to the site and
[2:42:05.160 --> 2:42:09.080]  we're front page so they're testing us out on the weekend
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:13.960]  to a little bird might tell me maybe move into where neil
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:19.160]  boards says when he retires the point is the show is exploding all
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:21.800]  over the country as people discover that this is
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:25.720]  unscripted no teleprompter no notes what we've said even though
[2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:29.160]  it sounds crazy is coming true it's really happening
[2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:34.600]  now after my professional coughing fit on air
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:40.040]  people will ask why are you doing movie reviews of prometheus
[2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:46.920]  or of the new batman film that is coming out why are you
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:50.360]  doing this well it's because there are more messages
[2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:56.360]  implanted in popular culture than there are you know even in the news
[2:42:56.360 --> 2:43:00.520]  that's just one level of propaganda and whereas i like a good movie
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:04.360]  i like a good entertainment fantasy movie it's fine when you see messages in
[2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:06.360]  these films you need to be able to point them out
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:10.440]  and by pointing them out we get other people who've never thought about any
[2:43:10.440 --> 2:43:15.480]  manipulation going on to start thinking for themselves
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:20.280]  now batman the dark night rises is coming out uh july 20th
[2:43:20.280 --> 2:43:23.960]  and i mean no ill will towards people that made it but it's it's full
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:28.600]  a propaganda so we review the last two films and now the third film
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:32.120]  we have talked to folks that have seen screeners of it
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:35.640]  in focus groups but they made some changes since then so we're not a hundred
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:40.280]  percent sure on the entire plot but that's not even what we're
[2:43:40.280 --> 2:43:43.880]  even doing here we are analyzing just from the trailers
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:47.400]  and some other information what the films have contained
[2:43:47.400 --> 2:43:52.920]  and the message that they're selling to the public so here is our review
[2:43:52.920 --> 2:43:57.800]  ahead of time our breakdown of the propaganda uh from the leak we have
[2:43:57.800 --> 2:44:00.760]  that's pretty much the whole film but there's been some few changes we're
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:04.520]  told uh and more and from the trailer and again the last two films
[2:44:04.520 --> 2:44:08.200]  so here it is and then don't worry if you're a radio listener
[2:44:08.200 --> 2:44:12.920]  in the next uh hour or so we'll post it at info wars dot com it's on the web
[2:44:12.920 --> 2:44:16.600]  yet i'm going to premiere it here the audio for radio listeners the video for
[2:44:16.600 --> 2:44:20.040]  people watching on prismplanet.tv and then we're going to upload it to our
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:23.960]  big official youtube channel in the next hour it will be live at info wars
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:27.480]  dot com and throughout the weekend you're able to go there and watch this
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:31.480]  then we're going to come back after this is over and get into some other news i
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:35.560]  haven't hit yet concerning fast and furious and this is looking
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:40.040]  like obama's waterloo so stay with us here is my
[2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:46.600]  breakdown uh warning there are spoilers of the new batman film
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:59.080]  one of the most anticipated movies in a long time is about to come out
[2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:03.400]  the dark night rises get ready because we are going to
[2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:10.840]  leak spoil and decode the new batman film that's coming out
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:16.600]  we're going to get into the meaning behind the meaning the secrets behind
[2:45:16.600 --> 2:45:19.880]  the secrets but first understand this is one of the
[2:45:19.880 --> 2:45:23.960]  most successful propaganda franchises out there
[2:45:23.960 --> 2:45:29.400]  selling tyranny for all of you that say it's just a movie
[2:45:29.400 --> 2:45:34.840]  for more than 50 years the department of defense has paid and financed for most
[2:45:34.840 --> 2:45:40.600]  major action films they all have a unified propaganda
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:45.560]  message telling you on the idea that you're powerless
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:50.280]  and that you can't protect yourself only shadowy groups
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:53.720]  by violating your rights and liberties can keep you safe
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:45:57.400]  throughout the batman franchise any vigilantes
[2:45:57.400 --> 2:46:01.560]  other than batman are powerless pathetic
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:08.360]  fat stupid or psychopathic to understand the conclusion
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:11.720]  of the dark night series we first have to go back
[2:46:11.720 --> 2:46:18.120]  to the beginning in batman begins a secret society known as the league of
[2:46:18.120 --> 2:46:22.280]  shadows led by ross al ghoul played by liam
[2:46:22.280 --> 2:46:27.400]  nison seeks to put a poisonous psychotropic drug in the water
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:31.000]  supply to drive a gotham the archetypal new york
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:34.680]  into total insanity then he will bring order
[2:46:34.680 --> 2:46:38.840]  out of the chaos and as all informed people know
[2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:42.360]  governments have been fluoridating water supplies for more than 60 years
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:47.480]  causing brain damage and cancer so we see here in the first installment a
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:51.160]  revelation of the method or the power structures showing you how they operate
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:54.280]  that there are secret societies that manipulate
[2:46:54.280 --> 2:46:57.880]  for good and bad bruce wane the aristocrat
[2:46:57.880 --> 2:47:02.120]  the banker the globalist has his secretive system
[2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:08.840]  and then there's the evil outlanders trying to come in and take over
[2:47:08.840 --> 2:47:14.600]  in part two batman the dark knight we're introduced to the joker now let's
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:19.000]  analyze the underlying messages here he is a
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:24.840]  non-conformist a libertarian type who makes his own clothes and
[2:47:24.840 --> 2:47:30.280]  burns money nothing matches on prince dna
[2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:35.560]  dental clothing is custom no labels he doesn't go along with the main line
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:40.200]  consumerist corporate culture and so he's got to be
[2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:47.080]  a murdering psychopath who enjoys blowing up hospitals bridges ships and
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:47:53.640]  killing police officers but our hero the rich banker industrialist
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:57.640]  bruce wane have developed a system to hack into cell
[2:47:57.640 --> 2:48:01.640]  phones and use them to create a sonar system that can give them a three
[2:48:01.640 --> 2:48:06.520]  dimensional view of what's happening by using defense department technology
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:09.880]  they were developing to hack into all the cell phones
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:16.040]  and use them as audio microphone systems they're able to save the city
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:22.280]  because they violate everyone's rights and spy on them without warrants
[2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:25.720]  so again it aids and abets and gives comfort
[2:48:25.720 --> 2:48:31.560]  the criminal elements in the nsa who on record are spying on the american people
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:36.280]  and using all of our appliances from smart meters
[2:48:36.280 --> 2:48:40.520]  to computers to smartphones to spy on us all of it
[2:48:40.520 --> 2:48:47.880]  is pro tyranny propaganda we now move from part two to part three
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:54.040]  the dark night rises so let's start decoding the dark night rises
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:57.960]  number one look at the name the dark night
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:03.240]  rises and we're told that he's willing to give it all up
[2:49:03.240 --> 2:49:08.840]  you've given them everything not everything
[2:49:08.840 --> 2:49:12.200]  not yet oh you've already given these people so much
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:19.640]  i haven't given everything so he's this christ figure this dark christ who is
[2:49:19.640 --> 2:49:25.800]  fighting the evil secret society led by bane who is coming to destroy
[2:49:25.800 --> 2:49:31.400]  babelon the beautiful city here's a few juicy spoilers
[2:49:31.400 --> 2:49:34.920]  batman gets his back broken in a fight with bane
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:38.760]  at the end as bane is dying we learn that he's a Darth Vader character
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:42.760]  who can't survive without the mask which is the recurring cyborg
[2:49:42.760 --> 2:49:47.080]  archetype that humanity can't live without machines
[2:49:47.080 --> 2:49:53.000]  who is bane he's a symbolic demon a destroyer a symbol of the hegelian
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:58.440]  dialectic order out of chaos to the conscious mind
[2:49:58.440 --> 2:50:02.120]  these symbols don't register to the subconscious
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:08.120]  they are clear commands just like you're a computer
[2:50:08.120 --> 2:50:11.400]  the power of hollywood the power of images
[2:50:11.400 --> 2:50:15.480]  the program the mind is not debated and the pentagon
[2:50:15.480 --> 2:50:19.480]  and madison avenue know that remember back in 1975
[2:50:19.480 --> 2:50:24.280]  went for more than two years the beaches were almost empty in the united
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:29.080]  states and areas of europe and australia because people were so scared
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:32.280]  that a giant shark was going to eat them
[2:50:32.280 --> 2:50:36.120]  psychological warfare chiefs certainly paid attention to that
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:40.360]  even though on average less than five people die a year
[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:44.360]  from great white shark attacks worldwide people would not
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:47.720]  go in the water and were demanding shark patrols
[2:50:47.720 --> 2:50:51.880]  and more lifeguards for a non-existent threat
[2:50:51.880 --> 2:50:56.040]  and that's what these movies do not just these batman films
[2:50:56.040 --> 2:51:01.160]  every one of these films has terrorist blowing up major cities constantly
[2:51:01.160 --> 2:51:05.880]  to create the psychological illusion that there's big sharks out there that
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:09.000]  want to eat you and there's terrorists under every table
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:13.240]  that want to attack you and your family and you notice at the end of jaws
[2:51:13.240 --> 2:51:17.960]  the shark has been killed he's been defeated but still the beaches
[2:51:17.960 --> 2:51:22.200]  remained empty you are being subconsciously programmed
[2:51:22.200 --> 2:51:26.920]  when you go in one of these movies and just turn yourself over to it
[2:51:26.920 --> 2:51:30.280]  and suspend a disbelief you become a willing
[2:51:30.280 --> 2:51:33.640]  victim to have your mind literally programmed
[2:51:33.640 --> 2:51:37.800]  in that key fear state because when the mind is in that fear state
[2:51:37.800 --> 2:51:43.240]  it is wide open to be reprogrammed and now in the new film we see the football
[2:51:43.240 --> 2:51:47.400]  game blown up we see the police helpless
[2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:50.760]  if the state doesn't take every right we've got
[2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:54.120]  and turn our children against us and set up highway checkpoints
[2:51:54.120 --> 2:51:58.200]  and launch 30 000 armed drones and listen to our phone calls
[2:51:58.200 --> 2:52:02.200]  and none of us are safe because the non-existent threat of
[2:52:02.200 --> 2:52:08.760]  Usama bin Laden and al-ciyeda and bane are going to get us
[2:52:08.760 --> 2:52:13.000]  the key to understanding why the social engineers want males
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:16.200]  in an arrested development junior high mentality state
[2:52:16.200 --> 2:52:22.920]  is simple through thousands of films and video games we are bombarded with the
[2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:27.400]  idea that threats always come in the form of a
[2:52:27.400 --> 2:52:32.600]  giant evil monster or terrorist who openly announces themselves
[2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:38.440]  not through slow cultural death and men are presented with an idea of arnold
[2:52:38.440 --> 2:52:43.240]  Schwarzenegger the herculean figure or somebody like batman
[2:52:43.240 --> 2:52:47.160]  defeating the enemy all by themselves because the public
[2:52:47.160 --> 2:52:51.240]  is powerless that's why now when i talk to so many men they say
[2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:55.000]  oh you're such a hero you go out and confront politicians you go out and
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:57.560]  you know fight for freedom i'm glad you're there
[2:52:57.560 --> 2:53:00.680]  what do you mean i'm just an average person like you
[2:53:00.680 --> 2:53:03.640]  we're not fighting big green martians from mars
[2:53:03.640 --> 2:53:07.720]  we're not fighting you know shadowy groups like bane unless you talk about
[2:53:07.720 --> 2:53:10.200]  the private fellow reserve this hijacked this country
[2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:14.840]  we're fighting the new world order we're fighting a corporate
[2:53:14.840 --> 2:53:19.080]  takeover system with regulations and and red tape
[2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:23.480]  that doesn't announce itself as an enemy but it just oozes in with bureaucracy
[2:53:23.480 --> 2:53:27.080]  to dominate and usurp our lives we're fighting the un
[2:53:27.080 --> 2:53:30.920]  and agenda 21 and a federal government bought and paid for
[2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:37.320]  by foreign interest engaging in treason when you're conscious or awake aware
[2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:41.160]  watching when you don't suspend your disbelief
[2:53:41.160 --> 2:53:46.040]  you see the programming the manipulation the hypnotic suggestions
[2:53:46.040 --> 2:53:49.960]  right there like it's written on the wall but when you're unconscious like a
[2:53:49.960 --> 2:53:54.920]  general population you are wide open to be victimized by
[2:53:54.920 --> 2:53:58.360]  this programming hey i like a good action
[2:53:58.360 --> 2:54:01.160]  adventure and movie as much as the next person
[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:04.680]  there's nothing wrong with enjoying a film if you're aware of the implanted
[2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:08.440]  images but it's important that people become
[2:54:08.440 --> 2:54:12.120]  conscious of the manipulation that's going on so please
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:15.720]  share this presentation with your friends and family and visit info wars
[2:54:15.720 --> 2:54:20.600]  dot com or slash batman where we've posted some other examples
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:33.880]  of brainwashing they're taking place in our culture
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:37.880]  that's right and we are going to post that video in the next hour at info wars
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:42.040]  dot com at that url that we just mentioned it's not up yet we'll add
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:45.080]  some documentation other film reviews that i've
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:48.200]  done are going to be showing a bunch of my film reviews tonight
[2:54:48.200 --> 2:54:54.760]  on the nightly news seven o'clock central at prisonplanet.tv
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:55:00.280]  now again foolish people out there will say oh it's just a movie
[2:55:00.280 --> 2:55:04.520]  we showed documents during the video if you're a radio listener that show
[2:55:04.520 --> 2:55:10.840]  where foreign governments the pentagon corporate interests all pay
[2:55:10.840 --> 2:55:14.600]  or even the script writing of these films they pay to have things written
[2:55:14.600 --> 2:55:18.920]  into the script they pay to have subliminals added
[2:55:18.920 --> 2:55:23.880]  it's all there and you're being bombarded there's a reason the public
[2:55:23.880 --> 2:55:26.840]  many people are like zombies there's a reason people don't care about
[2:55:26.840 --> 2:55:29.160]  themselves there's a reason because the whole culture is
[2:55:29.160 --> 2:55:33.160]  telling you overtly your trash and that death is good and kill grandma and kill
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:35.720]  children up to age three and euthanize everybody and
[2:55:35.720 --> 2:55:38.680]  they're teaching the kids that they're scum and that humans need to die and
[2:55:38.680 --> 2:55:42.120]  that we're hurting the earth and then there's covert messages that were
[2:55:42.120 --> 2:55:45.880]  scum and trash and garbage and that it's sexy and cool just to die
[2:55:45.880 --> 2:55:49.400]  we're being programmed to turn off our survival instincts
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:53.560]  we're having our human propulsion system deactivated we're having
[2:55:53.560 --> 2:56:00.200]  our rudders our compass removed and so it's just a
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:03.960]  bunch of aimless people looking to the television looking to the culture to
[2:56:03.960 --> 2:56:09.400]  give them guidance i follow what you say why aren't i happy
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:13.560]  and the systems like do more of what i say take some prozac
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:17.400]  you know mutilate your body take these drugs
[2:56:17.400 --> 2:56:20.360]  do all this that will fulfill you and then it doesn't fulfill it you think oh
[2:56:20.360 --> 2:56:23.720]  my gosh i better do more but you're not even thinking you're just
[2:56:23.720 --> 2:56:29.080]  subconsciously being programmed and following what they tell you to do
[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:32.520]  grown men are like children most of them when i talk to them
[2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:37.320]  children women i mean look at the feminist revolution
[2:56:37.320 --> 2:56:40.520]  women act on average like complete pieces of me
[2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:44.760]  they're totally unhappy they're running society now i was down at ut
[2:56:44.760 --> 2:56:49.000]  yesterday shooting footage for another report we're gonna air next week
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:52.360]  and i was just it was nothing but women and then
[2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:55.560]  who was it jacob senator was it uh no jacob senator wasn't there he was putting
[2:56:55.560 --> 2:56:58.920]  that piece together it was erin it was rob do one of them had read the
[2:56:58.920 --> 2:57:01.720]  statistic it was true i was about to say it they looked at me and they said
[2:57:01.720 --> 2:57:04.680]  forget which one it was they're walking across the parking lot
[2:57:04.680 --> 2:57:08.200]  from the natural history museum and they said yeah because women pay back their
[2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:11.640]  student loans it's just it's just amazing when you
[2:57:11.640 --> 2:57:14.600]  realize all the programming and the deeper you get into it
[2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:17.880]  and again it's not that we don't want to empower women it's not to empower you
[2:57:17.880 --> 2:57:22.280]  your new husband is the state and he's gonna abort your babies he's gonna
[2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:25.480]  inject you with cancer viruses he's gonna give you breast cancer
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:28.360]  and he's gonna chop your body up and sell your organs when you die
[2:57:28.360 --> 2:57:32.840]  when you die that's a loving husband isn't it it's nice to see men your boys
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:35.880]  falling apart it's great you're ruling the roast as
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:39.320]  hitler said first you get the women then you've got the children so follow the
[2:57:39.320 --> 2:57:42.280]  men and 80 plus percent of advertising targets
[2:57:42.280 --> 2:57:44.520]  women
[2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:47.960]  and not all women have succumbed to it men have turned in on average to just
[2:57:47.960 --> 2:57:52.760]  total jellyfish rest of development about age 12 mentally
[2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:57.080]  uh women uh are hyper tarts on average but can't
[2:57:57.080 --> 2:58:00.440]  find fulfillment and are going completely insane
[2:58:00.440 --> 2:58:04.360]  you know the police are out of control on average because the public's out of
[2:58:04.360 --> 2:58:08.840]  control we are a immoral degenerate filthy
[2:58:08.840 --> 2:58:13.720]  fallen society rotting and we're not going to be able to turn
[2:58:13.720 --> 2:58:17.960]  that around without recognizing all of us
[2:58:17.960 --> 2:58:21.640]  recognizing good from evil on the fast and furious again house
[2:58:21.640 --> 2:58:25.480]  committee um suspects say cover up no kidding and
[2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:28.360]  they're still gonna have the meeting with him they say they may compromise
[2:58:28.360 --> 2:58:31.880]  that's terrible news we need to bring criminals to justice not set the
[2:58:31.880 --> 2:58:35.640]  precedent they can do whatever they want more coming up but i will be live on
[2:58:35.640 --> 2:59:02.200]  the radio this sunday four to six be sure and join us
