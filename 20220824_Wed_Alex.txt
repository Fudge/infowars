[00:00.000 --> 00:04.880]  Founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats
[00:11.720 --> 00:18.660]  Well Alex you're the gladiator and you keep on pounding the opposition. I love it Alex Jones. Nice. Yeah, you've been demonized
[00:20.960 --> 00:27.000]  I mean you must be a threat if they call you out by name Alex Jones Alex Jones Alex Jones
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.840]  Yeah, I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories Alex Jones
[00:33.840 --> 00:39.240]  Obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bully. You didn't call me to testify in America
[00:39.240 --> 00:46.400]  I have a right to fix my accusers and you congressman doge are a liar and a fraud the real election medley is by Facebook and Google and others
[00:46.400 --> 00:50.560]  That are shadow banning people that are outright banning people and they're blocking conservatives
[00:50.560 --> 00:57.600]  Involved in their own first amendment political speech info war tells viewers that the world is out to death. The FCC is cracking down on
[00:57.840 --> 01:04.160]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones info war is just lost their war on info yesterday Apple
[01:04.160 --> 01:10.400]  I choose video and Spotify YouTube Twitter and Facebook have all blocked Alex Jones and info wars
[01:10.400 --> 01:17.600]  So there's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying can you ban this person? I want them shut down
[01:17.600 --> 01:22.360]  I want them silence. I want to mute it. I think they are horrible for our society. I want them shut down
[01:22.640 --> 01:26.880]  I want them silence Alex Jones, which is now been taken off Facebook thank God
[01:26.880 --> 01:32.200]  But who is the most banned news network in the world info wars dot com info wars?
[01:32.200 --> 01:37.480]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones info wars comes to mind. What's happened with info wars
[01:37.480 --> 01:43.760]  I would love it if you would follow up also about Alex Jones info war info wars. You want info wars president Trump is
[01:43.760 --> 01:51.880]  The info wars president Trump appeared on Jones's show. He actually went on Jones's show and said your reputations
[01:51.880 --> 01:54.280]  It's amazing. I will not let you down
[01:54.280 --> 02:11.640]  And the way as well, why do you hate the first amendment so much that man's breath
[02:18.280 --> 02:20.280]  I'm getting pissed out
[02:20.280 --> 02:25.920]  The defibrillator didn't work with me. It's all straightforward attack. That's the real power. Hello
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.240]  This is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex
[02:35.520 --> 02:39.600]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the first amendment
[02:39.600 --> 02:53.480]  But instead attack dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech
[02:59.560 --> 03:07.040]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set
[03:07.040 --> 03:13.240]  We've got to have a civilian national security force. That's just as powerful just as strong
[03:13.800 --> 03:19.400]  Just as well fun growing concerns that the IRS is building an army of new auditors
[03:20.880 --> 03:26.320]  When it comes to the internal revenue service the IRS your first thoughts are likely about money and taxes not
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.760]  Tactical training. That's the kind of training though typically associated with the FBI or secret service
[03:31.760 --> 03:34.640]  Yes, the tax ban is also getting trained in a similar way
[03:34.640 --> 03:39.600]  Senate passes sweeping tax climate change package
[03:39.760 --> 03:49.440]  It hires 80 plus thousand IRS agents in the legislation to target blue collar and middle-class people to shut down small businesses
[03:51.200 --> 03:55.800]  An IRS internal report shows heavily armed agents
[03:56.200 --> 04:01.640]  Practicing and all-out assault on a suburban home as part of their training exercise
[04:01.640 --> 04:10.280]  These agents now carry firearms. They wear tactical gear and according to a recent job posting at irs.gov
[04:10.840 --> 04:15.760]  Internal revenue agents will now be authorized to use deadly force
[04:22.600 --> 04:24.600]  You don't want them coming after you
[04:24.600 --> 04:37.560]  They are putting everyone on a list to either be raided or arrested or charged with terroristic threats. That's what they're doing
[04:39.800 --> 04:44.760]  Bottom line, you don't want the IRS coming after you with this or with this
[04:45.720 --> 04:50.120]  They are the kind of accountants that are prepared for anything with the IRS
[04:50.120 --> 04:53.480]  You're under arrest. You're going to jail, buddy

[05:55.080 --> 06:17.080]  To support our longtime viewers and listeners and for new folks to take advantage of it
[06:17.080 --> 06:25.640]  Live from Austin, Texas. It's alex jones
[06:29.160 --> 06:33.640]  It's wednesday august 24th of a year is 2022
[06:35.720 --> 06:38.600]  And i told you in the last few years it was coming
[06:39.640 --> 06:41.640]  And i hammered on it
[06:41.640 --> 06:43.640]  And i tried to warn people
[06:43.640 --> 06:49.960]  But trump didn't listen and the poison shot was even more deadly than i thought it would be
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.080]  Even though top scientists predicted everything that happened
[06:53.160 --> 06:55.160]  I found it a little too bold
[06:55.160 --> 06:59.720]  When they tried to put in a regime of forced inoculation worldwide and a worldwide medical ID
[07:00.200 --> 07:05.800]  To be tied to the carbon tax the social credit score and the universal basic income all officially rolled out now
[07:06.840 --> 07:09.480]  I thought they would have a placebo or something
[07:09.480 --> 07:14.600]  Or some of it just didn't do anything so they'd set the precedent and not have any bad effects
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.840]  Instead they went ahead and went right to the nanotech bio weapon
[07:20.120 --> 07:22.600]  And now the democrats are officially coming out
[07:23.320 --> 07:25.320]  I have dozens of articles
[07:25.640 --> 07:32.200]  Saying trump is to blame for the poison vaccine and the vaccine is a poison and the vaccine is killing people
[07:32.200 --> 07:38.520]  Trump absolutely completely and totally has been set up
[07:39.720 --> 07:44.680]  And they were holding the economy hostage telling him that he had to do all this if he didn't ram it through
[07:46.040 --> 07:48.040]  And he rammed it through
[07:48.440 --> 07:51.400]  And now he's like well, you shouldn't kick the military out for not taking it
[07:51.400 --> 07:55.640]  You shouldn't make kids take it in it shouldn't be mandatory. That's good trump, but it's a
[07:56.280 --> 07:57.800]  day late
[07:57.800 --> 07:59.800]  And a lot of lives short
[07:59.800 --> 08:02.040]  There's still time for trump to extricate himself
[08:03.240 --> 08:08.120]  And expose this people say well who cares let him burn. He's getting a lot of good republicans elected
[08:09.160 --> 08:12.840]  He understood the new world order the un he secured the borders. He
[08:14.040 --> 08:17.400]  Stabilized the dollar he made us the number one energy exporter again
[08:18.680 --> 08:20.680]  The enemies of freedom hate trumps cuts
[08:22.200 --> 08:25.160]  And that's what makes it so sad that he wouldn't listen to his
[08:25.160 --> 08:31.720]  Advisors like don jr. Who's been warning him and roger stone has been warning him and i've been warning him
[08:33.320 --> 08:38.920]  Now last week i put on an emergency warning to the president saying you're going to be set up by this and
[08:40.520 --> 08:43.240]  President reached out and said why why are you so upset?
[08:44.920 --> 08:48.360]  And i shot another video over the weekend an emergency message part two
[08:48.840 --> 08:54.920]  Explaining that you're being set up and the left went crazy and thought i was currying favor with disannas or currying favor
[08:54.920 --> 08:58.360]  With trump then i i'm a politico like them i'm not a politico
[08:58.920 --> 09:02.120]  I don't make decisions off of what it does for me
[09:02.840 --> 09:08.440]  I make decisions off what it does to fight for humanity which i'm a part of that's how i operate
[09:09.720 --> 09:13.960]  But both stories went viral tens of millions of views online and helped trigger a bigger debate
[09:13.960 --> 09:19.880]  And that was my point by saying trump i'm done with you if you don't come out against fauci and berks
[09:19.880 --> 09:24.600]  And dazzic and gates now they have set you up
[09:26.040 --> 09:29.160]  And that became really clear right when the vaccine was about to roll out
[09:30.120 --> 09:34.440]  First the democrats roll for it the so-called vaccine and then right as it was about to roll out
[09:35.960 --> 09:38.760]  They're like we don't trust this we don't trust trump
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  We're not taking anything he comes up with
[09:41.640 --> 09:45.800]  And i knew it was all a bunch of democrat deep state people that were actually behind it in the whole history
[09:45.800 --> 09:52.840]  I knew trump had actually killed gain of function studies in 2017 when he got in and actually stopped a lot of fauci's operations
[09:53.320 --> 09:56.600]  So trump did a lot of good things and you know, he ran through monoclonial
[09:57.320 --> 10:00.520]  Antibodies that worked great didn't have any side effects to save a lot of people
[10:00.920 --> 10:03.960]  I had family on the edge of death took it five hours later. They were better
[10:04.680 --> 10:06.200]  literally
[10:06.200 --> 10:08.200]  so
[10:08.680 --> 10:10.680]  It it's a mixed bag
[10:11.080 --> 10:14.360]  But we're going to open the phones up today on this subject because here it is
[10:14.360 --> 10:22.040]  Politico ap all of them trump white house exerted pressure on fda for covid 19 emergency
[10:22.520 --> 10:25.000]  Use authorization house report fines
[10:26.120 --> 10:32.760]  Now of course trump pushed warped speed. That's not a singer, but they're already putting reports out. He's to blame. He's the problem
[10:33.960 --> 10:39.480]  And you've got walensky and berks and redfield and fauci
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.040]  All of them saying it wasn't their fault. It's trumps fault now
[10:45.080 --> 10:47.560]  This is so obvious. We can see this from a mile away
[10:48.920 --> 10:51.000]  And now trump is a sitting duck
[10:51.960 --> 10:53.960]  This is disgusting
[10:53.960 --> 10:57.400]  But the left's gonna have a problem though after they worship the shot as
[10:58.040 --> 11:00.040]  mammon from heaven
[11:01.880 --> 11:06.040]  And now they're gonna flip on a dime and the new thing will be trump killed all these people
[11:06.040 --> 11:09.720]  So it's trumps tree. He's sitting in it
[11:11.160 --> 11:18.360]  Unbelievable trump white house exerted pressure on fda for covid 19 emergency use authorization house report fines. We're gonna hit
[11:19.400 --> 11:21.080]  these reports
[11:21.080 --> 11:23.320]  In a moment, but first there's a short compilation
[11:24.040 --> 11:26.520]  of the democrats pre positioning themselves
[11:27.480 --> 11:30.760]  Right when the vaccine was coming out when trump thought he was about to win reelection
[11:31.160 --> 11:34.200]  And then as soon as he was out then they said that they wanted to make it mandatory
[11:34.200 --> 11:38.760]  And you could see the moves they're making plain as day here it is
[11:39.160 --> 11:45.720]  I think it's going to be a very skeptical american public about taking the vaccine and they should be we can't trust the president
[11:46.440 --> 11:48.440]  and take his word and
[11:48.680 --> 11:53.240]  Take a vaccine that might cause harm to us if and when the vaccine comes
[11:53.560 --> 11:57.640]  It's not likely to go through all the tests that needs to be ended trials that are needed to be done
[11:57.880 --> 12:02.760]  Let's just say there's a vaccine that is approved and even distributed before the election
[12:02.760 --> 12:04.600]  Would you get it?
[12:04.600 --> 12:10.920]  Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us when we finally do god willing get a vaccine
[12:11.240 --> 12:13.240]  Who's going to take the shot?
[12:13.240 --> 12:16.280]  Who's going to take the shot? We will need to have access
[12:16.920 --> 12:24.120]  To the vaccine results so we can make our independent assessment to make sure that donald trump's fingerprints are not on it
[12:24.280 --> 12:26.600]  You can be the first one to say put me sign me up
[12:27.320 --> 12:30.120]  They now say it's okay. Is the vaccine safe?
[12:30.120 --> 12:34.840]  Uh, frankly, I'm not going to trust the federal government's opinion
[12:35.560 --> 12:42.840]  And I wouldn't recommend to new yorkers based on the federal government's opinion and the question of whether it's real when it's there
[12:43.160 --> 12:46.680]  That requires enormous transparency. Would you trust that vaccine?
[12:46.840 --> 12:49.560]  There's very little that we can trust that comes out of donald trump's file
[12:49.720 --> 12:54.200]  We cannot take for granted this process will be free of political influence
[12:54.200 --> 13:01.560]  I don't trust the president and I don't trust the FDA if donald trump can't give answers and the administration can't give answers
[13:01.560 --> 13:07.160]  These are questions the american people should not have confidence. You're going to say to the american people now
[13:07.560 --> 13:10.600]  Here's a vaccine. It was new. It was done quickly
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.560]  But trust this federal administration and their health administration that it's safe. I will say that
[13:17.560 --> 13:24.600]  I would not trust donald trump. Hey, how confident are you in the approval process of the FDA right now?
[13:24.840 --> 13:26.360]  How confident am I?
[13:26.360 --> 13:31.080]  Uh, I'm not that confident. Yes, I would be hesitant, but I'm gonna ask a lot of questions
[13:31.480 --> 13:38.840]  You're going to need someone other than this FDA and this cdc saying it's safe
[13:39.240 --> 13:42.520]  You've got to make all of it available to other experts across the nation
[13:43.080 --> 13:44.920]  So they can look and see
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.520]  So there's consensus. This is a safe vaccine. What I'm worried about is that there's some sort of october surprise
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.880]  And that there's a pressure put on the decision makers here to announce the vaccine in october of 2020
[13:56.040 --> 14:04.520]  We're going to put together our own group of doctors and medical experts to review the vaccine and the efficacy and the protocol
[14:05.160 --> 14:10.440]  And if they say it's safe, then i'll go to the people of new york and I will say it's safe
[14:10.440 --> 14:14.920]  But if donald trump tells us I should take that we should take it. I'm not taking it
[14:19.720 --> 14:21.240]  So
[14:21.240 --> 14:23.800]  For one month six months before the election
[14:24.760 --> 14:27.240]  There was an exact talking point that snow and your
[14:27.960 --> 14:30.040]  That's when you know, it's coming right from the new world order
[14:30.680 --> 14:38.120]  There was a word-for-word talking point by all the democrat talking heads and cnn and abc and msnbc and the new york times the washington post
[14:38.120 --> 14:46.120]  That we cannot trust this vaccine and then suddenly they flipped and said not only can you trust it?
[14:46.120 --> 14:48.120]  You should be made to take it just a few months later
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  They were putting that into the record
[14:51.240 --> 14:57.160]  Knowing people don't have a long-term memory on average to then bring it back later as the cover for what they did
[14:57.640 --> 15:01.240]  Trump has a silver lining. He never said it should be mandatory
[15:01.720 --> 15:03.720]  And he never said it should be for children
[15:03.720 --> 15:09.000]  They immediately began to say should be mandatory before he was even removed from office via election fraud
[15:09.880 --> 15:13.400]  Trump needs to release all his communications with these people how they came to him
[15:13.640 --> 15:16.920]  How they recommended warp speed how they said this would get the country going
[15:17.640 --> 15:21.160]  Because we've seen pieces of those communications and we know they did it
[15:21.640 --> 15:26.120]  Then they flipped once he took the bait and set him up set us up
[15:27.880 --> 15:30.520]  If trump listens to me very carefully to be listens to you
[15:30.520 --> 15:37.400]  He'll be able to actually bring these people to justice, but they're intending to bring him down
[15:38.600 --> 15:43.160]  With this hit us with a bio weapon hit us with their bio weapon shot
[15:44.600 --> 15:47.160]  And then turn around and blame it on us their main target
[15:48.840 --> 15:55.080]  This is a big big deal drew her nanos is going to pop in respond to this loss of open phones throughout the broadcast today
[15:55.320 --> 15:57.320]  Stay with us. This is a big big deal
[15:57.320 --> 16:05.000]  People say Alex Jones crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guys a nutcase. You got these rants and all that
[16:06.600 --> 16:08.200]  What they miss
[16:08.200 --> 16:11.960]  Is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics
[16:12.520 --> 16:14.840]  Of signal not noise if you look at the signal
[16:15.560 --> 16:17.560]  and you compare that
[16:17.640 --> 16:25.240]  To pbs and npr and bbc and we'll do what alex jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there
[16:25.240 --> 16:29.960]  And if you're a sent the human being and just watching it you say we've got alex jones as a head of this
[16:29.960 --> 16:34.120]  Not only that he kind of explained it. You are one of the great thinkers of this
[16:34.680 --> 16:38.120]  That is very rare. You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.400]  And see that in this new book. I got to tell you when tony lions first approached me. I read this thing
[16:43.400 --> 16:46.200]  I go. This is it. This is no beetry
[16:46.760 --> 16:50.360]  You're not going to be flipping pages or you're going to be having a pin out and you're going to be underlying stuff

[18:05.800 --> 18:10.520]  Most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life the big tech companies
[18:10.520 --> 18:16.360]  They don't want you to read this book. They want to control what you think what you do what you read
[18:16.520 --> 18:22.440]  But you don't want that and alex jones doesn't want that and this book shows you what's happening and gives you
[18:22.680 --> 18:26.840]  The sort of playbook for how to fight against it and so by buying this book
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.560]  You're going to prove that censorship doesn't work that freedom is alive in this country
[18:31.880 --> 18:33.880]  This is essential reading
[18:33.880 --> 18:38.200]  And you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in
[18:38.200 --> 18:43.000]  It's not going to be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in libraries
[18:43.080 --> 18:48.200]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can but they're not going to be able to do it
[18:48.360 --> 18:52.600]  Prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset. Thank you, alex jones

[19:58.280 --> 20:06.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[20:16.280 --> 20:19.080]  Your phone calls coming up. I'll give the toll free number out in a moment
[20:20.920 --> 20:23.800]  For a very critical reflection point right now, please
[20:23.800 --> 20:28.680]  Pay attention info wars tomorrow's news today
[20:38.440 --> 20:41.320]  So I know pr when I see it
[20:42.520 --> 20:46.360]  I know pre-programming when I see it and once you're conscious of the enemy's operations
[20:47.080 --> 20:49.560]  What they're gonna pull what they're gonna do it becomes crystal clear
[20:49.560 --> 20:55.480]  It's all I knew that they were starting a war with russia and ukraine over the last eight years
[20:56.120 --> 20:58.120]  it's coming to a head
[20:58.520 --> 21:00.200]  and
[21:00.200 --> 21:02.440]  I looked up when the snow
[21:03.320 --> 21:05.320]  on the ice melts in ukraine
[21:05.720 --> 21:11.800]  Then I called up some of my sources that I knew were already over in that area leave it at that
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.560]  And I said I think they're not being invasion
[21:16.680 --> 21:18.360]  other russians
[21:18.360 --> 21:20.360]  They said yeah by the end of february
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.160]  I came on air and told you that but I didn't need those sources
[21:28.760 --> 21:30.760]  To be able to tell you that
[21:31.800 --> 21:35.800]  I mean these are the people over there training ukranians how to shoot down russian helicopters
[21:36.760 --> 21:40.520]  When I got up here on air and I told you that was coming it wasn't it wasn't pulled out of the air
[21:42.120 --> 21:43.880]  now sometimes
[21:43.880 --> 21:49.480]  The globalists are planning something and we talk about it to try to stop it and they change their plan then we're wrong
[21:51.080 --> 21:53.080]  That's why we're only 95 accurate
[21:55.080 --> 22:00.520]  And a lot of the things that we think we've been wrong about later. It turns out we were right about and I'm not saying that
[22:01.240 --> 22:03.240]  To say oh, I'm smart
[22:03.240 --> 22:10.680]  Once you know the new world order and you've got all the deep state and all the democrat leaders invested in the poison shots and bill gates involved
[22:10.680 --> 22:17.880]  And they come to trump and say we can't ever end the lockdown because it won't be a vaccine unless you do this accelerated program
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.960]  And they don't criticize him when he first announces it
[22:23.640 --> 22:27.320]  And then right before it comes out they go he's to blame when it hurts everybody
[22:29.400 --> 22:31.800]  And the talking points the exact same script
[22:33.560 --> 22:38.520]  Just like worldwide they use the build back better in the great reset. It's a campaign slogans
[22:38.520 --> 22:43.800]  It's a campaign slogans. It's a global new world order corporate fascist party
[22:45.720 --> 22:50.520]  A play a short clip though trump's done this hundreds of times from the beginning saying you shouldn't be made to take it
[22:51.640 --> 22:54.280]  And things along those lines. So that's a saving grace
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.120]  Because remember it's the democrats that tried to make everybody take it and in many places like healthcare
[23:00.120 --> 23:05.560]  They did and across the world. They're beating people up and taking them to jail that leave their houses and haven't had it
[23:05.560 --> 23:09.560]  But it's like italy and australia and austria
[23:12.200 --> 23:13.400]  It's incredible
[23:13.400 --> 23:20.600]  But now there's a house report that it was trump made them put out the experimental shot and there's serious concerns about it now
[23:22.440 --> 23:25.640]  Oh, no concerns for fiser or maderna or bill gates
[23:28.520 --> 23:30.520]  No
[23:30.520 --> 23:34.280]  It's all trumps fault and it is kind of trumps fault
[23:34.280 --> 23:36.280]  Well, he walked
[23:37.080 --> 23:39.080]  Right into
[23:39.480 --> 23:41.480]  The trap
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  Absolutely walked right
[23:45.320 --> 23:49.880]  In to the trap and i'm not trying to throw the baby out with the bath water here
[23:50.840 --> 23:53.720]  The new older hates trump. They want to take him out. That's why they set him up with this
[23:55.080 --> 23:57.240]  When open the phones up then what do we do?
[23:58.600 --> 24:00.760]  And you had to stand us early on went along with it too
[24:00.760 --> 24:05.640]  He just was smart enough to figure it out and started to remove himself from it the last year and a half
[24:06.520 --> 24:09.480]  Boys trump would have done that but now that he knows all this
[24:10.120 --> 24:12.120]  And isn't doing anything
[24:13.320 --> 24:18.280]  He goes from somebody we can forgive like balsam aros never really pushed it but he let him do it
[24:18.600 --> 24:23.480]  We apologized six months ago and again a month ago and said i am so sorry. I'm proud of my life
[24:23.880 --> 24:25.720]  I'm proud of the work i've done
[24:25.720 --> 24:27.320]  I never tried to hurt you on purpose
[24:27.320 --> 24:31.400]  But i should have opposed this completely this damn thing doesn't work and it hurts people
[24:31.560 --> 24:36.760]  And we should bring the justice those that are for trying to force it and they've got the un and his own supreme court
[24:37.160 --> 24:41.000]  Trying war crimes on him for opposing the shot being mandatory
[24:43.320 --> 24:46.840]  Truth is trump took fiser money. They were one of his biggest donors
[24:46.840 --> 24:56.040]  And they scripted it all where trump would be the hero
[24:58.280 --> 25:01.880]  Look at these headlines. Well first, let's play the club of trump saying it should be mandatory
[25:03.160 --> 25:10.200]  Do you mean a fully approved vaccine for everyone the full public or a partially approved vaccine with emergency use?
[25:10.280 --> 25:15.960]  Now we're looking for a full vaccine for everyone that wants to get it not everybody's gonna want to get it
[25:15.960 --> 25:20.200]  But we're looking at a full vaccine. Is that a correct statement? Yeah, we'll please
[25:21.880 --> 25:25.320]  So the answer is the answer is yes, we're working for a fully approved vaccine
[25:25.400 --> 25:29.320]  But we'll also use the tools we have for instance emergency use authorization
[25:29.880 --> 25:37.240]  As as appropriate we use all of our regulatory tools to bring vaccine available for the entire american population by january
[25:39.320 --> 25:44.040]  Unbelievable the devil speak fully approved for emergency use meaning not fully approved
[25:44.040 --> 25:46.040]  It's a little word games right there
[25:46.840 --> 25:48.840]  Decepticon activity
[25:50.040 --> 25:52.040]  So trump's in a pickle
[25:52.440 --> 25:54.840]  Because the wheels are coming off if you read the spars
[25:55.720 --> 26:01.880]  2025 2028 document that's really a battle plan blueprint for attack like a bank robber plan
[26:02.520 --> 26:05.800]  But set years in the future, but it's really in the year 2020
[26:06.520 --> 26:07.880]  2023
[26:07.880 --> 26:10.200]  by the middle of the second year
[26:10.200 --> 26:17.560]  Of the vaccine rollout. They admit it doesn't help you and hurt you and then leaders get blamed and get in trouble for it
[26:19.080 --> 26:22.760]  And there's a whole un overhaul of medicine to make sure it never happens again
[26:23.320 --> 26:25.400]  It has hundreds of tweets in it
[26:26.120 --> 26:31.480]  That then later this was a year before they released the virus. They actually used on twitter
[26:32.760 --> 26:36.920]  The wef the un word for word. They just changed the acronyms
[26:36.920 --> 26:40.520]  So you just open the blueprint up every day and it tells you what you do today
[26:41.320 --> 26:43.320]  It tells you what you do tomorrow
[26:44.200 --> 26:51.160]  It's like our air force the strategic air command with the bg-2s. They train on flying into russia and dropping
[26:52.040 --> 26:55.480]  hydrogen bombs and launching hydrogen bomb tip cruise missiles
[26:56.360 --> 27:02.600]  And they have battle plans. They have war games and those war games are what they'll actually do when they launch an attack
[27:02.600 --> 27:07.320]  Well spars 2023 20 25
[27:08.840 --> 27:10.600]  2026
[27:10.600 --> 27:14.920]  Is an actual battle plan so the people carrying it out can go? Oh, no
[27:15.960 --> 27:22.520]  FBI if they did their job or others. Oh, no, I just have this war game. We're not actually doing it
[27:23.880 --> 27:29.160]  But just like with the nuclear forces the war game for the submarines and the aircraft and the missile silos
[27:29.160 --> 27:37.160]  Is the exact attack profile where they tell the submarine captains and they tell the bg-2 captains and they tell the
[27:39.080 --> 27:41.080]  Intercontinental ballistic missile commanders
[27:43.400 --> 27:46.280]  Launch plans seven four nine eight three six delta
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.520]  Let's pull up that plan. All right primary targets initiate program
[27:50.520 --> 27:59.480]  Turn keys launch
[28:00.040 --> 28:02.040]  That's the same thing here
[28:02.040 --> 28:04.040]  It's a damn
[28:04.040 --> 28:05.640]  playbook
[28:05.640 --> 28:09.640]  And you can capture your enemies playbook and not know what play they're gonna play when it's worse than a playbook
[28:09.720 --> 28:11.720]  It's a choreographed script
[28:12.360 --> 28:14.680]  Like a shakespearian play these war games
[28:14.680 --> 28:21.960]  And if they do this we do that and if we do this they do that and if this country comes in we do that
[28:22.840 --> 28:25.480]  And they thought 30 40 moves out and i'm sitting there
[28:25.720 --> 28:31.160]  We do a three hour analysis of it the former head of defense intelligence agency reads it and says this is real
[28:31.400 --> 28:33.560]  This is the battle plan. This is what they launched
[28:34.840 --> 28:40.840]  Now he can't tell you all the classified stuff he knew or how he stopped trump from authorizing the release of this stuff in china
[28:41.080 --> 28:43.080]  in 2017 general flin
[28:43.080 --> 28:47.880]  But he can say watch what jones says. This is their plan
[28:49.480 --> 28:55.240]  I don't need classifications to be the head of the defense intelligence agency to see the enemy operation. It's all completely clear to me

[33:57.320 --> 34:01.640]  Your word of mouth and your support your Hernandez is joining us at noon
[34:01.640 --> 34:06.280]  Give his take on trump and now the democrats are now blaming him for the poison shots
[34:06.280 --> 34:12.280]  But I want to give the toll-free number out on this issue and this issue alone
[34:12.920 --> 34:15.800]  We don't screen your phone calls in we're not going to control what you say
[34:16.760 --> 34:18.760]  We want a clean phone line
[34:19.400 --> 34:21.400]  And then we want you
[34:21.480 --> 34:23.480]  to talk about that topic
[34:24.040 --> 34:28.840]  We do free-for-alls a lot, but routinely I have your new listener. I want to hear from everybody
[34:28.840 --> 34:34.680]  On the specific issue of who do you blame for the poison shot more?
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.200]  Who do you blame the wuhan the chycoms bill gates peter dazik
[34:41.720 --> 34:47.960]  Fauci who are obama who in 2015 at chapel hill north carolina their own scientist said they're creating
[34:48.920 --> 34:55.080]  superstars bio weapon cross bc's chimeric viruses and obama moved the project to wuhan
[34:55.080 --> 34:58.760]  Trump but as usual obama isn't even in the discussion
[34:59.480 --> 35:01.480]  or the people that control obama
[35:02.120 --> 35:04.840]  And we sit here chasing our tails and now they've set
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.440]  Trump up the populist movement and the crew in seconds found the article on a new scientist
[35:13.160 --> 35:15.160]  from 2015
[35:15.800 --> 35:17.800]  Where they were warning of gain of function
[35:19.480 --> 35:21.240]  Bio weapons
[35:21.240 --> 35:27.000]  And if you try to talk about that you get censored by big tech who's heavily invested in it
[35:27.640 --> 35:29.640]  lab main coronaviruses trigger debate
[35:31.080 --> 35:38.040]  The creation of gain of function chimeric SARS like viruses has scientists discussing the risk of gain of function research
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.120]  And they know hearings are coming when the republicans get in they know they're the ones behind it
[35:44.120 --> 35:51.240]  And instead of trump figuring that out and extricating himself. He sits there
[35:52.680 --> 35:54.680]  Like a giant orange gremlin
[35:56.840 --> 35:58.840]  I mean that nicely I call myself a goblin
[35:59.720 --> 36:01.720]  He sits there
[36:02.040 --> 36:04.680]  And lets himself be sucked into this black hole
[36:04.680 --> 36:13.720]  Imagine if trump comes out and says he was lied to and mislead and calls for Fauci's arrest. He'll be hailed as a hero
[36:14.680 --> 36:20.680]  Hey, I listen to the scientists. I listen to the doctors monoclonials, you know Fauci wasn't for that, but I said do it
[36:20.680 --> 36:24.920]  They work great. I had no idea they'd pull this and he didn't he's not a bio
[36:25.800 --> 36:28.280]  engineering genetic engineering
[36:28.680 --> 36:30.680]  virologist
[36:30.680 --> 36:35.960]  All right, I'm going to give the toll free number out
[36:36.440 --> 36:41.720]  It's 877-789-2539 877-789 alex
[36:42.200 --> 36:44.200]  877-789-2539
[36:45.400 --> 36:48.520]  First-time callers long-time callers you agree you disagree
[36:48.600 --> 36:55.960]  I really want to hear what you have to say the wild card of the people having a voice to millions of viewers and listeners
[36:56.360 --> 36:58.360]  I just love it
[36:58.360 --> 37:01.720]  We're going to take phones throughout the full broadcast today
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.080]  Marjorie Taylor Green told me she'd come on Wednesday. I talked to her Friday
[37:08.360 --> 37:13.240]  But we haven't been able to get her on because she got SWAT team rated last night in a SWAT event
[37:14.040 --> 37:16.280]  We have been swatted. I have been swatted
[37:16.760 --> 37:19.480]  I never really talked about it because I don't want to encourage those that do it
[37:20.040 --> 37:22.040]  But I've been swatted
[37:23.160 --> 37:25.160]  Five times
[37:25.960 --> 37:27.960]  That we know of
[37:27.960 --> 37:31.320]  And the police just had my address in their database and
[37:32.520 --> 37:36.520]  At the first time they just know it's bs. They come knock on the door and they say you got swatted again
[37:38.120 --> 37:40.840]  And they went next level a few months ago. I haven't talked about this yet
[37:42.680 --> 37:44.760]  But they filed just you know what they're up to
[37:45.400 --> 37:47.720]  through a computer system out of washington state
[37:49.160 --> 37:51.480]  Which means it was internally done a fake
[37:52.280 --> 37:54.280]  arrest warrant
[37:54.280 --> 37:57.960]  Out of washington state for years truly for raping children
[37:59.240 --> 38:02.360]  We were contacted by the travis county sheriff's department. My lawyer was
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.800]  And they said they hit a bunch of other texas counties
[38:06.440 --> 38:08.440]  They've never seen that before
[38:08.680 --> 38:14.440]  In their internal system arrest warrant alex jones a judge frost that doesn't exist signed it
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  And there's a criminal investigation going on
[38:17.080 --> 38:22.920]  They're they're pissed because it's not about alex jones. They're like we got people filing fake arrest warrants now
[38:22.920 --> 38:24.920]  How are they doing this?
[38:24.920 --> 38:27.560]  They still haven't figured it out. There's an ongoing investigation
[38:27.960 --> 38:33.720]  But i'll just go ahead and tell you it's not fun. None of us. We're not being investigated. There's an ongoing investigation of whoever did this
[38:35.960 --> 38:37.960]  Multiple child rates
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.120]  And you saw what trended on twitter the last few days and I don't have the money and I don't want to do it
[38:44.120 --> 38:46.120]  But at a certain point I got to sue people
[38:46.440 --> 38:48.440]  They have democratic party operatives
[38:48.440 --> 38:55.080]  Running headlines alex jones's cell phone contained child porn mixing it with the two-year-old fake story
[38:55.320 --> 38:59.240]  That we sent child porn to the sandy hook families. Know somebody who's pro
[39:00.200 --> 39:01.640]  anti gun
[39:01.640 --> 39:03.640]  anti alex jones
[39:03.640 --> 39:10.680]  Sent an email with hidden child porn link senate. They asked for all these key terms in discovery. We gave them the emails
[39:11.720 --> 39:13.720]  unopened emails
[39:14.440 --> 39:17.320]  And then the news ran headlines alex jones caught with child porn
[39:17.320 --> 39:20.600]  And in documents he gave sandy hook parents
[39:22.520 --> 39:27.880]  So there's just no end to these people and they're really pissed we're exposing their pedophilia
[39:28.360 --> 39:30.360]  You have to understand the people we're finding
[39:32.120 --> 39:38.360]  They're pedophiles the large majority of the leadership of the people opposing us literally rape children
[39:39.720 --> 39:41.720]  So just remember that's who they are
[39:42.280 --> 39:44.280]  and never forget that
[39:44.280 --> 39:47.960]  That's why they're targeting children for gender reassignment mutilation
[39:48.600 --> 39:53.880]  All the rest of it. It's about destroying children and stealing their energy. That's what gets them big mojo
[39:54.440 --> 39:56.200]  with their god
[39:56.200 --> 39:58.840]  so again eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine

[40:17.480 --> 40:21.560]  Now they've had their big run now. They've poisoned billions of people now
[40:21.960 --> 40:26.760]  Oh, are they going to blame trump in australia or trump in germany or trump in france or england? No
[40:28.280 --> 40:31.160]  But domestically they're going to try to blame him for this shot
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.880]  But that will go worldwide and will save you more lives when it comes out that the shot was deadly poison
[40:37.880 --> 40:39.880]  incredible

[41:06.280 --> 41:08.280]  We get an average of 10 000 calls
[41:09.080 --> 41:12.040]  One time we had over 30 000 calls in just two hours
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.440]  That's how many great losers we got trying to call in we love you, uh, but

[48:38.840 --> 48:44.520]  Federal judge protects the religious rights of Marines refuse cobit vaccine a big victory also an info wars.com
[48:46.440 --> 48:50.760]  Washington Post opinion. I'm a doctor. Here's why my kids won't wear masks this school year
[48:50.760 --> 48:56.040]  So they abuse us then they turn around as the heroes who are all against it though when we were telling you
[48:56.040 --> 49:02.920]  Two and a half years ago two years ago a year ago six months ago. We were the devil. We were the worst people on earth for telling you
[49:04.200 --> 49:07.480]  Next year's news today. Thank you for backing us. Thank you for standing with us
[49:07.480 --> 49:13.080]  That's why they want to shut down because we're good and we care about ourselves and that means we care about everybody
[49:13.400 --> 49:15.400]  Because it's all symbiotic
[49:16.200 --> 49:20.040]  Big live evil as you can screw people over and I haven't come back on you. That's a fraud
[49:22.280 --> 49:24.280]  All right
[49:24.280 --> 49:27.160]  Let's go to your phone calls and the order that the calls
[49:27.720 --> 49:29.720]  Have been received
[49:29.800 --> 49:31.800]  Jordan in new jersey. Thanks for calling
[49:33.160 --> 49:37.960]  Hi, Alex. Uh, I I'm sorry about the first time caller thing. I I didn't I heard a free for all
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.280]  Oh, no, I said free for all. It's okay. It's okay. I apologize. No, no
[49:42.840 --> 49:46.920]  It's my fault. I said free for all then I saw I thought I saw some long-time callers
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.320]  I actually wasn't long-time callers calling in so I said, let's just do first time. Let's just let's just get to your point
[49:51.320 --> 49:55.720]  Go ahead. Okay. So, um, I just want to say this whole thing about the responsibility
[49:56.120 --> 49:58.520]  Where all this comes from as far as the whole release
[49:59.080 --> 50:03.240]  Right and then the inoculation program. I just want to make this theme known
[50:03.720 --> 50:07.320]  Uh, the national, um, you know, uh, defense real authorization acts
[50:07.800 --> 50:14.120]  All right, starting after, uh, you know, the 9 11, um fiasco and um, you know, of course
[50:14.680 --> 50:18.920]  That's right. They've been preparing this whole biomedical force inoculation tyranny
[50:19.480 --> 50:21.160]  for decades
[50:21.160 --> 50:26.360]  Yes, and it buried in all the and this is how they get all the republicans to go along all this crap too without them having any
[50:26.440 --> 50:29.960]  Sort of problem, right? Um, is they have them agree to these?
[50:30.360 --> 50:32.360]  um, nbaa's
[50:32.600 --> 50:35.960]  And and and each one become you can see in each step
[50:36.440 --> 50:41.240]  Um, them getting to human experimentation. That's right. Whether it's brazil or germany or the u.s
[50:41.640 --> 50:48.120]  They have the government signed non-disclosure acts and indemnified big pharma when they rolled this out and big pharma had financed
[50:48.120 --> 50:54.600]  And put all the major regulators in charge and the boards not just of our government but other governments who then advised the president
[50:55.160 --> 50:57.160]  And presidents to go along with the scam
[50:57.320 --> 51:02.120]  That's what you call capture of governments or penetration of governments that claus Schwab talks about
[51:03.400 --> 51:09.480]  Correct and the military industrial complex is all part of this big giant cabal that is trying to consolidate their power
[51:09.560 --> 51:13.480]  And 9 11 is a key event which makes you this fulcrum as you've discussed
[51:13.480 --> 51:21.800]  Uh, starting there picking up people like me in 2003 and slowly building this info army to where now you are fighting the ultimate battle
[51:22.040 --> 51:26.600]  Alex and you are now vested with all the power of all that information
[51:27.080 --> 51:32.280]  Um, and and all that knowledge that you put into great reset that we now need to um
[51:32.760 --> 51:38.680]  Do the power of gray skull, right and get and get and become what we need to be in order to fight the next part of this
[51:38.680 --> 51:45.560]  And that's why I I just the nvaa is though is where they built all the the national defense authorization act
[51:45.640 --> 51:51.320]  You're absolutely right and they had the model states health emergency powers act at george w bush rammed through
[51:51.800 --> 51:56.040]  For force inoculations as well. In fact, it's the exact same plan going back
[51:56.440 --> 52:02.280]  Uh to his second administration for the masking the six feet of separation all that was in that document
[52:02.280 --> 52:07.880]  Yes, and if and and if we're still questioning as to what to do people need to go back and look at all those
[52:07.960 --> 52:13.320]  Authorizations and find out where there might be more steps that might be taken by these psychopaths
[52:13.400 --> 52:17.800]  Because that's the blueprint exactly guys type in model states health emergency powers act
[52:18.280 --> 52:20.280]  2000 and
[52:20.520 --> 52:21.560]  five
[52:21.560 --> 52:23.000]  looked at up
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.560]  All right, sir great points amazing call. Thank you jordan
[52:25.560 --> 52:31.960]  And we are taking a long time callers for some callers that was just me going down a rabbit trail. Uh, let's talk to, uh,
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.160]  tom in tennessee you're on the air go ahead, sir
[52:36.680 --> 52:40.120]  Hey, what's going on now? Let's hope you're doing good brother. Um, I just wanted to say that
[52:40.120 --> 52:45.000]  I think it was kind of a double-edged sword for trump if he wouldn't have come up with a vax and
[52:45.720 --> 52:47.160]  You know push that
[52:47.160 --> 52:53.880]  He'd have been blamed for you know every death that happened because of covet but since you know, obviously since he did come up with one
[52:53.880 --> 52:57.320]  Uh, you know they're blaming them for the for the repercussions of it
[52:58.600 --> 53:03.880]  Um, but as but as far as moving forward, you know, I think trump's kind of
[53:04.760 --> 53:06.280]  becoming like a
[53:06.280 --> 53:09.640]  A toxic x that you know, obviously there's still feelings, but
[53:10.440 --> 53:12.440]  It might just be time to move forward
[53:12.520 --> 53:13.720]  um
[53:13.720 --> 53:15.720]  You know move on from it
[53:15.960 --> 53:19.000]  No, I agree, but they're gonna try to whether we love trump or hate trump
[53:19.000 --> 53:25.560]  They're gonna try to parlay everything into him as the as the sacrificial lamb and blame him thus blaming us
[53:26.040 --> 53:28.040]  And I don't see that dog hunting
[53:28.280 --> 53:34.680]  Especially if trump can extricate himself from this. That's that's why I've issued emergency message after emergency message to the president
[53:35.800 --> 53:40.760]  Absolutely, absolutely, but I mean there's a point though. I mean, you know, he's he's not
[53:41.400 --> 53:44.840]  He's not really backing down and taking responsibility for you know
[53:44.840 --> 53:51.240]  What he what he has done or at least shifting that responsibility a little bit to some of the officials that he took that advice from I think
[53:52.280 --> 53:57.480]  You know as far as as far as uniting and and and moving, you know, the country in the right direction
[53:57.480 --> 54:01.320]  I mean if if he's not going to deny it and shift responsibility, I think, you know
[54:02.600 --> 54:04.600]  We're losing hope
[54:04.600 --> 54:07.240]  I hear you and DeSantis is smart enough to get himself
[54:07.720 --> 54:10.600]  Away from it, which is again not about protecting DeSantis
[54:10.600 --> 54:15.160]  That'll make the whole thing fall apart then they can inject six-month-old babies with it
[54:15.560 --> 54:20.600]  That's why I that's why I'm going after trump using DeSantis knowing he's jealous of DeSantis
[54:20.840 --> 54:25.640]  So if we start empowering DeSantis is doing the right thing trump out do the right thing and I explained that last week
[54:25.720 --> 54:30.600]  I'm just simply trying to get trump to come out against it to save children. God bless you brother. I appreciate your go
[54:31.400 --> 54:38.520]  Let's go to Jason in Texas. Who is to blame for this? Is it trump? Is it bill gates? Because you know somebody's gonna pay for this
[54:38.520 --> 54:45.000]  Of course, it's bill gates and Fauci and all them. Why do you think they're getting pissed and he's trying to flee?
[54:45.720 --> 54:51.400]  Like uh, dr. Ron Paul said he ain't going nowhere. You know, we've been saying this from day one
[54:51.720 --> 54:56.520]  I'll tell you what right now. Here's their plan. They are gonna release
[54:57.880 --> 55:04.520]  A bomb or something on the u.s. They're gonna nullify this election. They know they're finished
[55:05.240 --> 55:07.240]  so you're gonna
[55:07.240 --> 55:09.240]  So I'm with you know
[55:11.880 --> 55:13.880]  And then they're gonna take over
[55:14.120 --> 55:16.120]  they won't even be an election and then
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.360]  on uh
[55:18.360 --> 55:20.360]  If you look in like certain cities
[55:20.760 --> 55:26.760]  I got a realtor my buddy's dad is a realtor and they kind of have the inside scoop on what's going to be what?
[55:28.280 --> 55:34.280]  And there's multiple big warehouses being built all over and nobody knows what they're for
[55:34.280 --> 55:40.920]  So when they turn the lights out and there's no heat or you know in the winter or you know in the summer for cool
[55:41.320 --> 55:44.280]  I'll come to this place, you know warm up. No, that's
[55:44.920 --> 55:46.600]  That's the death camp. No, you're right
[55:46.600 --> 55:49.800]  They're already creating warming centers and heating centers around the world in fact
[55:49.800 --> 55:52.840]  I was about to say this when you talked about cutting the power
[55:53.400 --> 55:55.160]  tsunami of shutoffs
[55:55.160 --> 56:02.120]  20 million u.s. Homes are behind on power bills same thing in europe. This is the designed collapse of civilization brother
[56:02.120 --> 56:05.400]  Thank you so much jason. I appreciate your call wow
[56:07.960 --> 56:14.440]  All right, we got huleos up next and so much more we got through her nanda's popping in to give his view on this but
[56:15.880 --> 56:17.880]  Believe it. This is the big issue
[56:19.080 --> 56:24.280]  Because the new world order is going down when it comes out they brought this shot out so they think globally they're gonna blame trump
[56:26.040 --> 56:29.400]  When it was the british intelligence of the new world order in our own defense department
[56:29.400 --> 56:34.600]  They launched all this people say oh the military will save us our military is full of good men and women
[56:35.160 --> 56:38.120]  But at the top they are new world order
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  And they think we're stupid
[56:41.480 --> 56:45.400]  And so ahead of the collapse they've soft killed as many people as they can
[56:48.920 --> 56:51.560]  Ahead of what the economic
[56:52.280 --> 56:57.080]  Total shutdown and and the and the cyber attacks are gonna blame on the russians. I mean you can just see it
[56:57.080 --> 57:00.280]  You can taste it. You can smell it. This is devastating
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.040]  That's why it's more important now than ever
[57:04.120 --> 57:11.080]  It's a symbiotic relationship to warn everybody because that could mitigate this that could back them down their plan's not going well
[57:11.320 --> 57:15.000]  Maybe there's some smart people in the system that are going to put the brakes on this. I mean thank god
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  It's coming out the shots kill people
[57:17.960 --> 57:20.680]  If folks hadn't woken up to it, they just kept riding that horse forever
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.200]  But their double back plan was to blame trump if it came out what they were doing
[57:24.200 --> 57:26.760]  So they're all run over the hills. They're all
[57:28.200 --> 57:30.360]  Engaged in you know fleeing the sinking ship
[57:31.400 --> 57:35.080]  This is the big debate. We're having the big discussion. We're having whatever you do

[1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:14.520]  Take a journey for the bright midnight
[1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:18.040]  Take a journey to the bright
[1:00:18.600 --> 1:00:21.000]  All right, wave and jenice. See you're on the air. Welcome
[1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:30.760]  I'm just sick of these freaking resilience in this government. I'm so sick of them trying to control our lives
[1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:34.760]  So sick of them poisoning us with these shots and these chemtrails and these
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:44.680]  I'm so sick of it. So sick of it. I just pray to god for a head to prediction over all of us every day
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:54.920]  I just want to say I remember you saying that that trump's son had been vaccinated and he got some sort of autism from it
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:01:00.600]  What the heck is going on with trump? What is he doing? He's black males. What is going on brother?
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:06.360]  Whatever it is, it ain't good. Thank you, sir. Julio in colorado. You're on the air. Welcome
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:15.240]  Well, it's great to chat with you. Alejandro patient zero before they carve your corpse up as I heard on the commercial
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:20.920]  Uh, look colorado denver colorado reminds me a lot of the great hank williams jr
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:26.120]  song o deed in denver. I call it mount skid row because uh, I hate to say it
[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:33.480]  But uh, this city is deteriorating faster and faster and that's going to be most of the country as energy bills
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:39.800]  Skyrocket as we hit into wind as we hit into winter now. Alejandro, I don't know who
[1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:44.680]  The senior donald trump is listening to who who his advisors are
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:51.640]  But he needs to either change advisors or listen more of his gut instincts because as you just mentioned
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:57.880]  We're going to see more and more articles as more and more people get sick as more myocarditis
[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:00.280]  Uh gets diagnosed
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:02.920]  This is this is going to get blamed on trump now
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:06.280]  He has this golden opportunity to turn around and say hey look
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:12.920]  Fauci lied to me irks lied to me. I mean they're they're all coming out and admitting that they lied to the president
[1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:14.840]  my pet
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:23.560]  Whoever the president is listening to he must change course immediately because it doesn't I mean yes across the country and across states
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:29.880]  maga type candidates are winning these types of elections or winning school board seats, etc, etc
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:36.920]  But it's quite clear Alejandro that uh, donald trump's going to get set up here in the coming months as
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:44.360]  The elite system is falling completely in there. Oh, absolutely elio. Thanks for the call. It's already begun dj in new york
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:46.360]  Go ahead
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:48.520]  Yeah, hi alex
[1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:50.920]  I just wanted to share with the audience
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:56.840]  For my many years of looking at this stuff going back to the 80s before you were on air
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:02:59.880]  I just
[1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:02.360]  keep looking at all the different players
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.840]  of the cabal
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:05.720]  and
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:07.720]  I can't help but to see
[1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:15.880]  The one of all of them that sits closest up to the capstone and that's the Jesuits. They're they're really the day
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:21.160]  They're the ones who are the progenitors of all this evil. Fauci is one of them
[1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:27.080]  Many of the others that we know are part of them. Well, the pope and the pope is
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:34.120]  Total new order taken over the pope is taken over the catholic church is subservient to the Jesuits in the knights of malta
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:38.280]  And they have their inroads going way back with the chinese
[1:03:38.280 --> 1:03:44.520]  That's why the catholic church is the only official church there and they don't know the portuguese discovered china made the first deal
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:50.280]  So I mean definitely the old more powerful the british empire has been the not the catholic people
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:55.400]  But the Jesuits in control of the rudders and and that was the secret maps into the ornate
[1:03:56.520 --> 1:04:00.360]  You can't become a head of state without them approving or allowing it
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:06.520]  They control the secret societies of the world. They control the monetary systems
[1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:10.520]  They can they are the ones in the driver's seat in the pilots
[1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:16.040]  Nest they they're they're in control. They're the ones that are the pedophiles
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:19.240]  That are the child traffickers the abusers
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:24.120]  They are the ones that people in the audience need to really research to discover
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:30.520]  Who their real enemy is when they say they well, there's no doubt that the jesuit order has taken over the catholic church
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:33.960]  He's pedophilia to do it and there's no doubt. It's one of the most ancient powerful groups
[1:04:33.960 --> 1:04:38.920]  There is but the average but they conflate that between catholics and that and I think catholics are great people
[1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:42.440]  But I hear what you're saying brother. Thank you dj. All right. We're gonna come back

[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:51.560]  There goes congressman small as well. Google is going to lie again and violate the law
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:54.360]  That's enough. You take too much noise. That man's breathless
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:56.760]  I'd like reserved time
[1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:02.760]  I'm getting pissed out
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:04.600]  Hey the d5 woman didn't work

[1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:21.960]  1776 will commence again if you try to take off fire on james on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the first amendment
[1:09:22.040 --> 1:09:28.040]  But instead attack dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:33.880]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not stacking down if you want a
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:41.880]  Comedians
[1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:57.880]  So the house representatives run by democrats was put out a report blaming trump for any vaccine
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:01.640]  Damaging he made them put out the experimental shot when we know
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:04.360]  It's foushee and bill gates the new world order
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:09.240]  Why does trump not understand that i was talking to drew Hernandez this morning via text
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.880]  He said me it's like he predicted it's now out there
[1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:19.160]  Headlines exclusive vaccinated making up higher proportion of cuba 19 metrics in the u.s. Including hospitalizations and deaths
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:22.200]  Same numbers worldwide. That's out of the epic times
[1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:26.280]  It's a big deal ladies and gentlemen drew Hernandez
[1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:30.600]  Thank you for joining us. I wanted to get your take on the situation. I think this is huge
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:35.800]  This shows the rats are leaving the sinking ship and if trump doesn't get ahead of this, this is going to bring him down
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:42.280]  Well, absolutely alex and uh, you know, thanks for having me shout out to the info warriors in the getter chat
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:46.200]  They want you to know that they love you very much alex, but I wanted to analyze
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:51.240]  This political article with you. Just take a look at the headline. Look at how they word this. Okay
[1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:55.960]  The trump administration pressured the fda to authorize
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:10:59.080]  unproven treatments
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:08.760]  unproven treatments for kovat 19 and the first kovat 19 vaccines on accelerated on an accelerated timeline
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:14.040]  Operation warp speed. Okay. People need to understand you are literally watching
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:20.600]  Propaganda begin to get fed to the public for a future narrative to be installed on president trump. That's right
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:22.680]  This is the kickoff. This is the kickoff
[1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:28.840]  This is literally the kickoff they use this verbiage because listen people have been banned for this stuff on
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:33.480]  Facebook and twitter for posting these exact same things saying trump's being set up
[1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:37.240]  Trump's being set up with operation warp speed. It's a bad vaccine
[1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:41.880]  It's not good for the people and it's being put people have been banned for this kind of stuff
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:45.320]  But we know what these people do alex. So they are kicking this off
[1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:51.880]  There's been a shift in the simulation and this is meant to mess with your mind. This is how the info war works
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:59.160]  This is how propaganda works. They're literally setting up the narrative for whoever is going to run in 2022 in the midterms already
[1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:06.520]  They're giving them more ammo to go to go against trump candidates and ultimately they're giving more ammo to whoever runs against trump in
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:12.840]  2024, okay now I say this because I love the republic and I love where our country
[1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:20.040]  Was going in 2016 to 2019 and I want to see that continue now when I say this about president trump
[1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:23.240]  I say this because I want him to just clearly understand
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:30.680]  I mean these people are literally setting you up to literally be the sacrificial lamb to blame millions of deaths
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:36.440]  And blame the vaccine negative effects that are happening to people not only mentally but physically
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:41.400]  Literally on you take a look at how the narrative is being set up and alex you know this
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:45.160]  What why is dr. Fauci writing off into the sunset in december?
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:50.040]  Is it because he's scared that there's going to be investigations and he's going to be you know expo
[1:12:50.040 --> 1:12:54.920]  That's not why it's because they're setting up trump to be to be to be the blame right now
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:59.560]  He's writing off into the sunset because they're setting up trump to blame for these bad vaccines
[1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:03.960]  That's why dr. Fauci is in the news literally today saying I have nothing to hide
[1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:09.160]  Yes, that's a quote. He's saying I have what why is he saying that alex because they know
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:14.600]  That they're going to blame all this on trump. Oh, well, well, I was just advising the current and it's not just him
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:19.480]  It's it's it's the head of the cdc. It's berks. They're all saying we knew it didn't work
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:24.920]  We lied so later they're going to go well. He told you years ago. They are literally pre-programming this right now
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:31.880]  Exactly that is exactly why the cdc is coming out saying the same thing and dr. Berks is coming out and saying the exact same thing
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:38.440]  We we knew all along that this this this wasn't effective. I mean we were advising the president at the time
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:45.960]  I mean that's that's what we were doing. They are literally going to pin this on president trump alone and he needs to understand
[1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:49.720]  That this is part of the scythe. I totally agree. Here's the key drew for me
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:51.240]  I don't want your take on this
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:55.320]  Whether you love trump or neutral or hating. I think overall he's a great guy, but I'm mad at him
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:59.640]  It doesn't matter. We don't want him getting the blame. We want Fauci and bill gates to get it
[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:02.520]  That's the key here
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:06.600]  We want the people that are responsible to get the blame and I'll say this as well
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:10.600]  President trump and the people around him don't wait too long
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:18.360]  The longer you wait the worse it looks the longer you wait the worse it looks and and and and this is part of the thing
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:21.640]  This is where we got to be careful to alex's part of this scythe
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:27.880]  Part of what they're doing to him is to get his own supporters that got him there to turn on him
[1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:33.560]  That's why media matters and all these people are running hit pieces on you alex to make it look like you literally hate trump
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:37.480]  But I know what you're doing you're trying to just get him to go against the global elites man
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:41.720]  Like go against these people like where where are you man? Can the real trump? Please stand up?
[1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:44.440]  Well, exactly. I've been I've been I've been tapping him on the shoulder
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:49.720]  I've been whispering in his ear and now I hit him in the head with a two by four politically to get his ass to wake up
[1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:55.880]  And that's all we want. We want president trump to just come out be aggressive against these people
[1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:58.840]  I mean really think about it right for people that are still sitting on the fence
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:02.040]  It's like, uh, I don't know this this this is maybe a little too much for me
[1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:09.480]  Listen listen listen. What have these people done in the past six years? Okay impeached him multiple times
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:15.960]  Set up his supporters. Okay with multiple psyops to even use that to turn them against him
[1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:20.520]  And now the fbi is being mobilized to go after not only his supporters
[1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:26.200]  But president trump and they they de-platformed a sitting us president
[1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:33.640]  Look how far this has gone president trump needs to wake up wake up right now and shift gears
[1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:37.480]  And get aggressive against these people and go on offense. That's all i'm saying
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:39.480]  Let's talk more about it. You're on fire. Absolutely, right
[1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:42.840]  Because the crowning thing they're gonna blame on him is the shot
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:46.200]  But they did it worldwide it was all coordinated by the un and the wef
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:52.520]  They are they ran it. They get the blame not our populist movement. This is so critical. We drew her nanda straight ahead

[1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:58.440]  I
[1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:05.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:23.240]  I am a shotgun rider for the sanyas into line
[1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:27.640]  And the desert is my brother my skin is cracked and dry
[1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:30.280]  I was riding on a full coast
[1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:36.040]  And everything was fine till we took a shorter road to save some time
[1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:41.720]  The bandits only fired once they shot me in the chest
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:47.640]  They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men
[1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:50.680]  I'll ride again
[1:20:50.680 --> 1:20:52.680]  Cause I'll ride again
[1:20:54.680 --> 1:20:56.680]  I am a river gambler
[1:20:56.680 --> 1:20:58.680]  I am a river gambler
[1:20:58.680 --> 1:21:03.080]  I'll make a living deed and cause my clothes are smooth and honest
[1:21:03.640 --> 1:21:05.640]  My heart is cold and hot
[1:21:05.880 --> 1:21:10.200]  I was shoveling force and dealt the boys on a boat for new Orleans
[1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:13.560]  I was the greatest shark that ever seen
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:19.000]  But the captain bumped a sandbar and an ace fell from my sleeve
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  They threw me overboard after swore I didn't cheat
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  But I could swear
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:28.040]  All right, Dr. Hernandez, if you were a hundred percent on target
[1:21:28.040 --> 1:21:32.440]  Issuing your own emergency message to President Trump, please continue my friend
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.600]  Well, alex listen, I just want to clear the air here. Listen, you know
[1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:43.480]  This current administration are the ones that came out and they pushed the
[1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:48.120]  Lockdowns they used Operation Warp Speed and they imposed it on the American people
[1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:53.240]  The heroes that were in the medical industry in 2020 became the villains in 2021
[1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:57.080]  The airlines that were all protesting people that lost their jobs
[1:21:57.400 --> 1:21:59.560]  It was a horrible thing that happened in 2021
[1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:03.000]  But the stage was set with Operation Warp Speed into Trump's credit
[1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:06.840]  He did dish it down to the governors in 2020 to decide whether they're gonna
[1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:10.440]  You know lockdown their states their cities or not, right?
[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:14.120]  So to Trump's credit, that's what truly took place according to history
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:18.760]  But at the same time this this is my heart and I'm just being honest with the viewers
[1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:22.040]  And I'm being honest with you alex and I think you feel the same way too
[1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:28.440]  I don't want to destroy Trump. I want the country to succeed. I want Trump to succeed
[1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:36.120]  I want our populist figures including alex jones myself and president trump and whoever else the ronda santa says of the world
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:43.000]  I want us to succeed because I want america to succeed. Everyone that's watching this just wants america to succeed
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:49.720]  But we know that these entities out there these global elites and the communists that have infiltrated all channels and society
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:56.920]  That have this agenda. They want this to be destroyed. It's the great reset. That's what it is president trump needs to come out
[1:22:57.240 --> 1:23:04.040]  aggressively against the great reset starting yesterday starting two years ago when it was all in motion
[1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:07.080]  Right now. I'm telling you right now. This is my opinion alex
[1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:10.120]  I don't know if people are going to agree with this, but this is what I see coming
[1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:15.160]  President trump people are either going to view you as someone that's in on this
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:21.080]  Or just too afraid to call out the global elite that you claimed you were willing to call out in 2016
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:27.160]  That is going to cause you to lose some serious support. I don't want that alex doesn't want that the american people
[1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:32.200]  That love this country and love you don't want that, but that's what they want alex
[1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:38.840]  That's what these deep staters want. That's what the global cabal wants. It's the perfect side. How do we detach?
[1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:42.600]  That's always been the number one question. Hasn't it been hasn't it been alex?
[1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:48.280]  How do we detach president trump from his loyal supporters? No matter what we've done
[1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:53.880]  Hillary clinton called everyone a basket of deplorables attack the voters attack the supporters
[1:23:54.120 --> 1:24:00.200]  Let's just demonize them as white supremacists even if they're brown or black. Let's just call them domestic paris
[1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:04.840]  They've tried everything they possibly can to detach him from his supporters
[1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:11.000]  This I will tell you right now is a very strategic way and an effective way to do that
[1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:16.840]  Because people are seeing this for what it really is. It's the truth and the facts don't lie
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:21.560]  This has been a setup. This jab is literally hurting people president trump
[1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:26.520]  We don't want to humiliate you. What I'm saying is just come out and tell the truth
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:33.160]  Well, you just said it. So start what you said last segment and this segment combine them because you said it better than I could
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:37.640]  Trump didn't do force inoculation. He didn't do force masking. They grabbed
[1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:43.480]  The program they launched under him as soon as biden got it. He accelerated it. Trump's just got to expose that
[1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:50.040]  Talk about that say they're the ones and then everybody will get behind him instead of letting them set him up. It's very simple
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:54.840]  Alex, you know this. Okay. You you know how the info war works
[1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:57.800]  You know how the media and propaganda works
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:04.920]  It's a narrative war if you let these people get way too far ahead of you in the narrative with their installed narrative
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:10.280]  Their installed propaganda, which is how we started this segment. Alex taking a look at that political article
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:14.120]  They're already using the verbiage to get the population ready to accept
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:18.360]  This was trump's fault too if president trump waits too long
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:22.760]  I fear it's going to be too late and even some of his supporters are going to start to see this
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:26.040]  And it's a genuine thing to take a look at and hold them accountable to
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:28.200]  And they're going to start to
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:33.640]  Pull back their support and go to people like the Santas because people and let me say this. It's it's it's key
[1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:41.000]  Trump thinks okay. I may have screwed up. I'll just hope it goes away. I'll quit promoting and I won't be for force inoculation
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:43.320]  And things like that. It'll just go away. No, no, no
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:48.760]  Because they were always planning to blame trump. They were always blaming to try to tie the republican leadership
[1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:50.600]  But they see trump as part of to this
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:53.800]  That's why he's got to overturn the whole thing and expose their scam
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:26:00.120]  So so he's probably thinking well this will blow over. They'll never expose themselves. No all these democrats are expendable too
[1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:05.400]  We're in the in game of the new world order trump. You've got to either be against the great reset or before it
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:08.440]  That's what drew her nan is to sing. You've got to make a choice
[1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:14.120]  Absolutely. I mean look how they do this. They they did this with the whole defund the police narrative
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:20.200]  2020 defund the police. We hate cops. We hate everybody j6 happens. We love the fbi
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:26.680]  We love law enforcement. Let's president biden. Let's actually refund the police. You see how quick they can do this
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  Okay, they can do this because they know they can
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:32.600]  Because they know they can and millions of people are going to be on board with it
[1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:38.760]  President trump needs to do this now. He needs to do this yesterday because if this narrative goes way too far ahead
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:43.640]  It's going to be too late for you. I totally agree. You keep saying you shouldn't yesterday. How long does he have?
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:49.640]  Before he's irrevocably coupled to this and and falls into their trap weeks months
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:55.480]  I would say maybe the next couple months the next few months because once they get this narrative installed
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:26:58.440]  People are literally going to run on this alex
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:05.720]  People running in the midterms are going to run on this very and they're going to run ads of biden saying I don't trust a shot
[1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:08.680]  Exactly. They were pre planting that then
[1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:14.760]  Alex we we think of that. It's like what how could anyone do that? Like that's just a total lie
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:21.560]  Nobody's going to believe that millions will they shift the simulation whenever they need to they do whatever the hell they listen
[1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:24.600]  Alex they did the same thing with the elections, right?
[1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:32.200]  2016 russia trump rigged the election 2020. There's no election fraud here. They could do whatever they want
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:35.240]  There's never been fraud anybody that says it should be arrested
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:41.880]  But we have hours of them saying it's all a fraud electronic voting machines naming the very company suing fox news four years later
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:43.960]  It's never happened. It's insane exactly
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:49.800]  Alex here's why he can't wait too long. Okay, if you wait too long
[1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:55.400]  They're gonna come out and they're gonna start to say see see we knew it
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:28:00.040]  Even he knows this is all his fault because now he's coming out and he's admitting
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:05.560]  He's admitting that he did wrong. You see you see voters. You see america president
[1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:08.360]  Trump knew all along that the vaccine wasn't ready
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:12.680]  So that's what ruined your life. You're one of the best. You're one of the smartest people. I know
[1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:17.160]  I'm not kissing your ass. You just have a way. I totally agree with you. What you've said is
[1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:21.160]  Your mouth to god's ears. This is totally true
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:24.520]  And if he waits too long, it'll be oh see he admits he did it
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:29.880]  He's got to come out and expose they set him up and set us up. He's got to do it now
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.960]  Exactly, they tried to do the same thing to you with the sandy hook stuff, right?
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:41.480]  You've been saying for years. Hey, you know, I apologize. I saw it wrong whatever but in the trial see see he admitted it
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:42.920]  He admitted but with president trump
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:47.640]  It's gonna be even worse because he's actually waiting and not coming out and condemning it aggressively
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:51.720]  All right, dr. Hernandez amazing job. God bless you. We'll talk to you again very very soon

[1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:31.880]  With our news coverage and our information
[1:32:32.760 --> 1:32:35.880]  We do the best with our supplements as well
[1:32:36.440 --> 1:32:39.960]  I mean look at the hair and beard support formula folks. This is a this is a joke
[1:32:40.120 --> 1:32:42.760]  I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off
[1:32:42.760 --> 1:32:48.920]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard formula is working for me
[1:32:49.480 --> 1:32:57.160]  Quite well, I might add quite well. My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now
[1:32:57.160 --> 1:33:11.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:22.360]  Big brother mainstream media government cover us
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:30.600]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he lie from austin texas broadcasting world-wide
[1:33:31.320 --> 1:33:33.320]  It's alex jones
[1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:37.960]  So i'm a news junkie and I read legislation. I watch foreign news
[1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:41.160]  I listen to other shows and I respect that you know, I follow
[1:33:42.920 --> 1:33:45.560]  This stuff every waking moment basically
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:47.800]  and
[1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:51.480]  I mentioned at the start of the show the congressional report coming out and blaming trump
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:56.680]  For the experimental shots and all that's happening. I told you that moment was coming and
[1:33:57.720 --> 1:33:59.720]  All the rats leaving the sinking ship
[1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:01.880]  berks and melinsky and
[1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:05.560]  Fauci and the rest of them saying, okay, I didn't work, but it's trump's fault
[1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:08.360]  but even dan bonjino
[1:34:09.240 --> 1:34:11.240]  Who's one of trump's closest confidants
[1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:16.280]  And who's the darling, you know of the republican establishment. I think he's a good guy
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:18.840]  Then a frequent guest will show till he got a job at fox
[1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:22.680]  He's come out and said the worst decision of his life was taking the shot
[1:34:24.840 --> 1:34:26.840]  All the health problems he's had so
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:30.520]  If trump watches his own
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:35.960]  Confidants coming out against it. What is trump thinking?
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:39.800]  And so I was talking to the producer scott during the break
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:43.720]  He said, why don't you just set a date?
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:48.360]  It's not an ultimatum because I'm not gonna do anything to trump. I'm just gonna totally stop supporting him
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:52.280]  Why don't we just set a date
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:58.040]  For if trump doesn't come out and say I was lied to it's Fauci and mill gates and
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:01.080]  It's a fraud because they're already doing that themselves
[1:35:03.720 --> 1:35:08.920]  It means he's blackmailed it means he's bought off it means he's he's dumb. I don't think I don't think that's the case
[1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:15.240]  He's already gotten away from the shots. He won't say the vaccine where he says. I'm still proud of the v word, but I won't say it
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:20.280]  People say move on from trump. Well, I mean he controls republican party right now
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:25.240]  So to get him on our side and to go after the globalist is critical
[1:35:25.640 --> 1:35:27.640]  That would be a good thing to have him working for us
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:30.280]  I'm not just trying to
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:34.600]  Alienate trump or ostracize trump or shun trump
[1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:39.960]  The evidence is overwhelming. It's all coming out. They know it's coming out. They already had a backup plan to blame trump
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:45.240]  And trump's going along with it. So trump can decide what he's gonna do, but he has to do it very very quickly
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:47.480]  So I noticed a caller
[1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:49.880]  Peter from washington wanted to talk about
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:54.840]  Dan Bongino has turned the vaccines agrees with aj. I thought oh, I have that clip
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:57.640]  We'll go to peter in a moment, but but here's Dan Bongino
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:00.200]  biggest mistake of my life
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:02.760]  I just should have waited
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:06.120]  I thought to myself at the time even told gi I said, you know, there's no doubt
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:10.280]  I feel like this was created and at this virus in a lab in Wuhan china
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:17.000]  I have little doubt about that and I figured, you know, I'd rather take my chances with something we created than something they created
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  Remember what I told you that key
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:20.520]  Because I was scared again
[1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:26.120]  I you know, my doctor told me with lymphoma and being under chemo that if I got this thing I
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:28.520]  It could be ugly. Let's just leave it at that
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:34.120]  Stupid why? I watched this clip from the Tucker Carlson show signing some research coming out
[1:36:34.840 --> 1:36:37.480]  And time is now past and we're starting to see things
[1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:44.120]  It's really most troubling minute 20 seconds. I've had to listen to it a long time because I'm scared of what's coming
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  I had it a little while ago and I'm afraid it's
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:51.880]  The repercussions of this for a lot of people have not been felt here. Check this out
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:55.320]  to neurodegenerative disease myocardial
[1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:59.880]  spells palsy liver disease impaired adaptive immunity impaired dna damage response
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:02.600]  Etc
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:09.000]  So it's possible. In fact, it's looking likely that the vaccine might suppress the immune system
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:14.280]  This fact the authors concluded will quote have a wide range of consequences
[1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:23.320]  Not the least of which include the reactivation of latent viral infections and the reduced ability to affect the immune system
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:28.840]  And the reduced ability to effectively combat future infections and quote
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:34.680]  Now again, we sincerely hope that's not true
[1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:38.760]  But it's not just the conclusion of one scientific journal
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:46.280]  The Lancet maybe the most famous scientific journal in the world released similar findings in february the Lancet's piece was entitled quote
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:52.440]  risk of infection hospitalization and death up to nine months after a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine
[1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:57.560]  A physician called Kenji Yamamoto made this observation with the data from the Lancet
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:03.880]  He wrote this in a letter to the journal of virology and we're quoting the study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:07.320]  Eight months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:11.240]  Was lower than that among the unvaccinated
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:14.040]  individuals folks
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:18.680]  science's patience science is long term science is chronological
[1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:21.800]  okay, so
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:25.720]  Now Don Dan Bongino tells us in the middle of 2022
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:30.360]  And Tucker's talking about it. That's great. We appreciate them. We hit the barb wire
[1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:37.000]  In february of 2020 and told you all this we told you every day. That's why we're under attack because we do our homework
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:42.600]  It's not about who gets the credit you need to know why we're marked for destruction because
[1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:48.280]  I don't know why these guys don't get it ahead of the curve. I mean Tucker gets lost without the curve
[1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:53.880]  But but but why they've got to actually see it all later the CDC and the FDA
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:00.840]  To cover their ass without a document in October 2020 predicting all the things that then happened
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:08.600]  Because they want to later go back and say oh look we warned you the bureaucrats cover their dirty little
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:11.880]  butts
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:20.520]  They did this on purpose they set Trump up and now we're just sitting there floundering around in circles
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:25.160]  But yeah, Dan Bongino now works decision of his life
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.400]  Yeah, what promoting it remember that too, you know
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:34.840]  Listen, I wish Dan Bongino was smarter than me
[1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:41.800]  I wish all these people saw what I see it's so frustrating like I just see it's right there a two-year-old could see it and that's why
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:43.800]  Drew Hernandez is amazing
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:47.880]  I'm good friends with Drew and I've known him a few years, but man
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:53.000]  He doesn't need to listen Alex Jones know what's going on. He's a Christian born again. He sees it. He has to certain
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:59.320]  Her Hernandez knows every step they're going to take. He knows how to stop them and there's a lot of Drew Hernandez is out there
[1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:01.720]  I know you're out there listening right now
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:06.440]  But I'm pissed off because I know we have the most important information out there
[1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:09.320]  And I know we're in battles
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:12.840]  And I've got a comment squeeze and beg the audience just to keep us on air every day
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:16.440]  Which I don't even want to do I don't want to sit up here and push products and do all this
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:19.880]  I bring you products that I think are great. I know do a great job, but
[1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:23.640]  I'm so far beyond all this
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:25.960]  I mean, you know, where are the wealthiest people in the world?
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:31.800]  Where are the people that don't want to be slaves? I mean, we have world government mark of the beast and plantable microchips
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:36.920]  Force inoculations that kill us out in the open. Where is humanity saying? No, that's why I love this audience
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:43.800]  Of activists because you care and you're involved and you're in forms. We'll go to break
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:45.320]  I want to cut you short

[1:46:55.240 --> 1:47:05.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:16.200]  A lot of people are reuploading online
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:21.000]  VHS tapes that recorded to myself 20 plus years ago on air
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:23.320]  They're going viral
[1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:27.960]  Instagram and tiktok and facebook and twitter take them down as fast as they go up
[1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:30.680]  But despite that they get millions of views a day
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:33.480]  here's a clip
[1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:35.480]  from 20 years ago in 2002
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.960]  Laying out the basics of the new world order
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:47.160]  Facts and common sense are in yes, there have been corrupt empires. Yes, they manipulate. Yes, there are secret societies
[1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:51.960]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history and yes today in 2002
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:59.800]  There is a tyrannical organization calling itself the new world order pushing for world-wide
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:05.560]  Government a cashless society open borders total and complete
[1:48:06.200 --> 1:48:07.240]  tyranny
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:13.480]  Where human beings are absolutely worthless there's six and a quarter plus billion of us and
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:17.640]  The globalists have said it many times. There's too many of us. We're causing a problem
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:22.200]  Uh, we need to be called at the tune of 80 percent. It's amazing to talk about that
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:26.760]  But it's the globalists to un their own public statements and they've convinced a lot of
[1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:30.280]  Liberals and elitist conservatives and others
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:35.560]  That by going along with this that we're intelligent members of society
[1:48:36.200 --> 1:48:40.120]  It's the ultimate mouth this world view. It is
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:44.120]  This radical virulent form
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:48.120]  Uh of social Darwinism. It's the excuse of
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:50.680]  tyrants
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:56.920]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources
[1:48:57.720 --> 1:49:02.600]  By centralizing and socializing health care the state becomes god
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:09.080]  Basically when it comes to your health and then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us
[1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:11.720]  We then basically get shoved into their system
[1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:17.800]  There's thousands of hours of me predicting it all and people ask on twitter. He must be one of them
[1:49:18.680 --> 1:49:20.920]  But i was sourcing their documents their admissions
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:27.320]  You could learn their documents as well. You could oppose them my friends long after i'm shoveled into my grave
[1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:32.040]  All right, i'm gonna go to julie and everybody else, but peter wanted to talk about this banjino clip
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:37.240]  There's a short clip of it him admitting the worst decision of his life was taking the shot biggest mistake of my life
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:40.760]  I just should have waited
[1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:44.680]  I thought to myself at the time even told gi I said, you know, there's no doubt
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:49.000]  I feel like this was created and at this virus in a lab in muhan china
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:55.160]  I have little doubt about that and I figured, you know, I'd rather take my chances with something we created than something
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:57.160]  They created remember what I told you that key
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:49:59.720]  All right, that's enough
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:02.920]  See now they know it's all coming out
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:05.800]  And dan's not bad
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:07.800]  And he's a leader just not an alpha leader
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:11.880]  A leader of leaders or do her nanda says
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:15.320]  And you are
[1:50:15.880 --> 1:50:18.280]  We've got to say the tough things years before others do
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:21.160]  We got to take one for the team
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.240]  That's what info wars is all about
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:25.720]  Peter go ahead from washington. Thanks for holding
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:27.960]  Thanks, alex
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:31.240]  The key about what dan said is it was the worst decision he made
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:33.800]  Children don't have a decision
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:40.040]  Matthew chapter 18, but those who offend one of these little ones better for him that a millstone
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:43.720]  Were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:48.200]  Trump needs to change his mind second in that chapter same 18
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:54.200]  If you tell this person in private they have aired and they don't listen to you if he she'll hear the
[1:50:55.080 --> 1:50:57.080]  Thou hast gained thy brother
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:50:59.240]  But if he will not hear the then take
[1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:05.160]  With the one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
[1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:10.120]  You and drew her nanda's and dan bunjino and possibly tucker
[1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:17.160]  Should tell trump in a joint communication that he needs to change his ways to save children
[1:51:17.320 --> 1:51:21.640]  Brother that is beautifully the bible. Well, I remember that verse as a child in Sunday school
[1:51:21.640 --> 1:51:30.760]  That is so powerful reproof somebody in private. Give them a chance where they don't go do a intervention. That's exactly the modern word
[1:51:31.480 --> 1:51:35.160]  That's the modern word for what's in Matthew chapter 18 read again
[1:51:37.560 --> 1:51:43.400]  Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against the go and tell him his fault between d and him alone
[1:51:43.720 --> 1:51:46.440]  If he shall hear the thou hast gained thy brother
[1:51:46.440 --> 1:51:53.080]  But if he will not hear thee then take him with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses
[1:51:53.560 --> 1:51:55.560]  every word shall be established
[1:51:57.080 --> 1:51:59.640]  Because now we're going to hold you responsible after the next morning
[1:52:00.840 --> 1:52:05.400]  Correct and then finally in that Matthew chapter 18 verse 22
[1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:11.080]  He basically tells peter how many times you should forgive someone who was aired and he says
[1:52:11.080 --> 1:52:18.120]  I say not into thee until seven times, but until 70 times seven in other words forgiveness is the
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:20.840]  cornerstone of christian life
[1:52:21.080 --> 1:52:27.880]  And we will forgive trump if he amends his ways and that's what we ask that he do for the sake of the children
[1:52:29.240 --> 1:52:34.360]  Well, that's right because if he's fully committed evil, I'll never turn back whether there's still a chance we should still keep hammering
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:40.440]  This is the gold standard if he won't turn back here. What are we to do but move on?
[1:52:43.720 --> 1:52:45.560]  Powerfully said what else do you want to tell people?
[1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:55.480]  They should listen to you and read the bible and see in the ways in which they both coincide and also that
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:00.200]  I guess the key is that children are the key
[1:53:00.200 --> 1:53:06.760]  Show your love for christ by your love for children. Show your love for your fellow man by your love for children
[1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:11.880]  Recognize those children trust us and depend on us to look out for them
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:18.040]  And that you have no greater duty than to help a child in need and the children who may be vaccinated
[1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:20.920]  Who may have their lives ruined who may never have children?
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:26.120]  You owe it to them to fight for them and god will see your face and smile
[1:53:26.120 --> 1:53:30.440]  If you have stood for the his littlest ones powerfully said peter. Thank you
[1:53:32.120 --> 1:53:37.080]  Anytime i'm feeling sorry for myself or even get a little bit scared god goes children
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  Children are an attack
[1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:44.360]  Children and then I
[1:53:46.600 --> 1:53:48.600]  I don't have any hesitation then
[1:53:52.440 --> 1:53:54.440]  That's it's everything
[1:53:54.440 --> 1:53:58.520]  And that's why everything the enemy is about is confusing and hurting children
[1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:01.240]  God wants to protect children
[1:54:01.320 --> 1:54:07.960]  Satanists want to hurt children. It's very simple. We don't have a choice. We're either going to defend children or we're going to join satan
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:17.000]  Again it goes back to scarface hypothetical movie written by
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:23.880]  Oliver stone based on a decade of research hanging out with drug cartels
[1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:30.840]  And there's a composite true story. It's like the godfather's positive true stories at the end Tony Montana saves his soul
[1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:36.680]  He's a killer. He's a criminal. He's a bad guy, but he's not going to blow up little kids
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:39.560]  No women no kids
[1:54:40.520 --> 1:54:42.520]  So you think i'm a worm like you
[1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:52.040]  Think I need this in my life? Trump means nothing to me. He doesn't stand up for the children. He's been given a lot of chances
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:58.520]  But I wanted to trigger a debate about this. That's why this platform is so precious. This is about credit
[1:54:58.600 --> 1:54:59.800]  It's about
[1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:06.600]  Understanding what you've done. You built this operation. You're the only reason it's here and we're causing major debate and having incredible victories
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:08.840]  That's why we keep info wars on the air
[1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:13.000]  That's why the enemies of freedom hate this broadcast and it keeps them up at night
[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:16.440]  Because I don't claim to be mr. St. Lee
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:25.640]  But I love god and I see god working through me and I see how I follow god's logic the older I get the more I submit to god's will
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:34.120]  Let's go to julie in pennsylvania julie. Thanks for holding it on the air. Hello
[1:55:34.120 --> 1:55:38.200]  Hello, sir. How are you? I know you've been going through a lot lately and uh, I
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:45.000]  Not the compared to six year olds and six month olds give the shots give them heart attacks. I'm fine. I'm a man. I'm
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:47.640]  I'm doing I'm doing great
[1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:54.840]  Well, I was very happy or not happy great told to hear that dan banjino finally said the right thing
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:56:01.800]  But what people don't understand trump had nothing to do with this. He was just being the businessman
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:07.960]  He was just being the businessman trying to set up a vaccine to get people to go back to work. That's all he was
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:11.400]  Exactly, but now that he knows he's got to come out against it
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:20.120]  Exactly see what he didn't realize was he stepped into a cold room of evil that you couldn't it was a black hole
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:25.080]  And this already began back in 1999 when bill clinton left office
[1:56:25.080 --> 1:56:33.000]  He signed a bill with the funding through the white house the department of navy research and defense and what they did was
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:37.640]  That was when they first created the nano industry that was funded by the department. No, you're right
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:41.240]  And then it was the defense authorization act and it was the model states of emergency act
[1:56:41.560 --> 1:56:48.760]  2001 2005 exactly we we know who did it all the patents are owned by the department of defense
[1:56:49.400 --> 1:56:51.720]  in cooperation with mit and harbert
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:54.840]  And and who was in the middle of that?
[1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:59.960]  Bg and we don't have to say anything more with his foundation
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:07.320]  And he was the one who had orchestrated and he was with them there all the way through in 2015
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:12.280]  He came forward and and in a symposium up and under
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:17.480]  mit he stated that they have tested this vaccine
[1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:24.600]  With millions of people already and then he did that did that in cooperation with the department of navy
[1:57:25.160 --> 1:57:29.560]  And that means they were already testing these things on our military
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:32.120]  Absolutely all of it was pre-tested
[1:57:32.200 --> 1:57:39.800]  Which is why the cdc knew it caused heart attacks and fertility blood clots and death incredible calls julie our callers are incredible
[1:57:39.800 --> 1:57:46.840]  All right, more calls than mtg coming up
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:53.560]  Ladies and gentlemen if millions of people get this book our funding problems will be over and it's starting to happen
[1:57:53.560 --> 1:57:57.400]  That's why I said yeah go to info workshore.com get the book and start shipping in a couple weeks
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:57:58.840]  The great reset in the war for the world
[1:57:58.840 --> 1:58:02.920]  But I said go to amazon because it's the number one book chart in the world
[1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:07.240]  And if it goes to number one not a political not of history not of us history
[1:58:07.240 --> 1:58:14.040]  It's already number one over 40 categories like political science. You name it 40 plus categories. It's number one ladies and
[1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:16.440]  gentlemen drum roll, please
[1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:20.920]  Of books in the world the great reset in the war for the world is
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:27.960]  One two three four five six seven eight nine. We are now number nine in the world
[1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:36.280]  This is major. This is political. This could fund our war chest. Just go to amazon.com everybody and buy 10 copies
[1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:41.240]  Send this blueprint to the death star and the new world order because you read this
[1:58:41.240 --> 1:58:45.560]  You know their whole plan how to stop them get the great reset in the world now. It's going to go to number one
[1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:47.640]  What do you make of that?
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:53.080]  The best product I'm not I'm not supposed to be biased but I'm going to tell you all now if you haven't tried turbo force
[1:58:53.080 --> 1:58:55.720]  You need to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:01.320]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week
[1:59:01.320 --> 1:59:05.880]  I don't I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and all the info works
[1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:08.920]  Products are down to take and control your life take control your health
[1:59:10.120 --> 1:59:12.120]  Not relying on other people to do it for you
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:15.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[1:59:15.800 --> 1:59:19.000]  And thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:23.800]  You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier happier and richer
[1:59:23.800 --> 1:59:27.480]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often
[1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:31.160]  It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said tape. There's such a good guy
[1:59:31.160 --> 1:59:35.720]  How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and fought that and that was me
[1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:38.760]  I woke up and thought you know what? Okay. I want to take control of my life
[1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:41.480]  I want to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to info wars calm
[1:59:41.480 --> 1:59:43.560]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance
[1:59:43.800 --> 1:59:48.200]  Don't buy into the group think don't drink the kool-aid drink the turbo force kool-aid's bad the turbo
[1:59:48.200 --> 1:59:58.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[1:59:58.680 --> 2:00:06.040]  When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
[2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:09.080]  When I stop and I turn and I don't feel right
[2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:13.080]  Then I get to the bottom and I see you again
[2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:20.360]  No one's ever done interviews with their sunglasses on. I have to keep them on to protect myself from the fire
[2:00:21.080 --> 2:00:23.160]  Which I'm about to bring to the world
[2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:26.360]  Racism's for the poor people because if you keep the poor people divided
[2:00:26.360 --> 2:00:29.960]  They can't wake up long enough to do what I did and read about how money works
[2:00:29.960 --> 2:00:31.720]  The future is based on enslavement
[2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:37.400]  It's based on removing your freedoms telling you safe to keep you believing the lies and being a good slave until you die
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:39.160]  It's almost like I predicted herself
[2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:41.800]  You know when Noah built the arc he was a crazy right wing piece of fear
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:44.600]  Until it started to rain right now. He's not crazy anymore
[2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:49.720]  But now that we have the internet and now people can look and fact check things themselves to like oh, okay
[2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:53.400]  Well our propaganda mechanisms they still work corona's proved a lot of that
[2:00:53.400 --> 2:00:57.160]  They still work, but it's getting harder and harder. So we need to distract the people
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:01.720]  We distract them. Did you know all the police are racist all of them every single police officer is racist
[2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:03.720]  You know, they're gonna kill you for no reason. Did you know that?
[2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:08.040]  It's a control mechanism. Who do you think is in charge of the world?
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:13.000]  You want me to go alex jones a level of one to ten how alex jones. Do you want me to go?
[2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:15.320]  No, I want you to tell me what you think
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:20.040]  Like if you had to say, uh, all right, there's all of this uh
[2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:24.840]  A kind of coordination to some degree is happening specifically around mainstream media
[2:01:25.640 --> 2:01:30.200]  Around the narratives that are created and they're done with a specific purpose in mind
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:36.840]  Who are the people who are planning that or are trying to coordinate all this? Okay, so I don't think it's like dark room
[2:01:37.400 --> 2:01:39.960]  Oh, it is actually kind of like this, but I don't want people to imagine
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:42.680]  I'm thinking as like dark room dudes sitting around making plans
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:45.640]  It's kind of like that, but it's just you know dinner clubs and golf clubs, etc
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:50.600]  What I truly not dark rooms lighted rooms like lit rooms. Yeah lit lit very fancy nice rooms
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:56.360]  No, but what I truly believe it is is that every single human on earth tries their very best to propagate their worldview for the same reason
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:01:57.480]  We're doing this podcast
[2:01:57.480 --> 2:02:01.720]  We're trying to explain to people how we think based on our own experiences and how we think the world should be right
[2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:06.840]  So if you have a worldview and you try your best to propagate it the more powerful you are the more influence
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:09.400]  You have over people the more likely you are to influence your worldview
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:12.280]  It's the same with any company right when you walk into your company at work
[2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:15.240]  You want to say look do this do this do this and people obey?
[2:02:15.480 --> 2:02:17.880]  You don't want to say do this do this do this and people disobey
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:21.560]  So if you're a very very important person and you're in charge of things and you control
[2:02:21.560 --> 2:02:25.640]  I don't know all the food in a country. You don't want a minister that's going to give you trouble
[2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:30.120]  Why would you want members of parliament to give you trouble? This is your country. You basically own all the land
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:33.240]  So you want a minister is going to say yes, sir. No, sir is your company
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:37.960]  So the more powerful you are the more likely you are to appoint people that enforce your worldview
[2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:40.520]  And there's certain people in the world today that have so much influence
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:43.480]  I don't even think they necessarily believe they're doing anything evil
[2:02:43.720 --> 2:02:47.560]  But they think and view the world a certain way and they use all of their political
[2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:53.080]  Leverage all of their friendships and all their financial leverage to try and point their the world in the direction
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:54.680]  They want it to go
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:02:57.880]  And that's exactly what's happening. These are the people who control the world the people control everything
[2:02:57.880 --> 2:02:59.880]  They control everything they control the news
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:05.320]  They decided I'm not gonna give my political views but the people who own the news channels decided it was better if
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:09.240]  Trump wasn't in the White House. They thought you know what he doesn't listen to us
[2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:11.240]  And I think I know best
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:13.880]  And I want a president who's
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:16.040]  Scenile and will sign anything we give him
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  And that's why Andrew Tate is banned
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:23.800]  You think the globalist love black people? They got a special place of hate in their heart for them
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:28.040]  That's why they give them gangster rabbits while they ship in the cocaine and the guns
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:31.880]  But you're banned for the average black folks to have but the criminals have here's a club
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:36.040]  Man fill it up. We're losing his mind people losing their mind out here just bollocks everywhere

[2:07:03.880 --> 2:07:09.560]  Hour we've been talking about this over two hours now the democrats saying trumps to blame the vaccine doesn't work
[2:07:09.560 --> 2:07:11.560]  It's poisonous congressional reports
[2:07:12.280 --> 2:07:18.200]  All these republicans fleeing all these minions that ran it bouchie and others and berks coming out saying it didn't work
[2:07:18.760 --> 2:07:20.760]  And trumps you'll still sit in there
[2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:24.360]  Being set up
[2:07:25.960 --> 2:07:27.960]  But who is responsible it's the u.n
[2:07:27.960 --> 2:07:30.920]  It's the globalist to control the defense department that set all this up
[2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:37.160]  It's obama and that's what i'm telling trump is he needs to go after the guilty not the ones that set him up
[2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:41.160]  But he's still sitting there dan in wisconsin. You're on the air. Thanks for holding

[2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:08.920]  Alex it's an honor. Good morning. Welcome go ahead
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:15.640]  Uh, well first and foremost x2 has saved my life and I just want to thank you for that amazing product
[2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:18.840]  Um, it is game changing. It is it is amazing
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:26.040]  It is. Um, I just want to bring up. There's a video online of bill gates talking about meeting
[2:09:27.240 --> 2:09:35.240]  President trump in march of 2017 in the white house and bill gates says he asked me if vaccines weren't a bad thing
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:40.920]  because he was considering a commission to look into ill effects of vaccines because
[2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:47.560]  Robert f. Kennedy jr. Was advising him that vaccines were doing bad things. That's right for those that don't know
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:50.680]  You're you're quoting a video interview on national news with bill gates
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:53.720]  Talking about how he convinced trump to be pro vaccine
[2:09:54.600 --> 2:09:59.400]  That's right. Well, so so the idea well, he was saying that that trump was resisting
[2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:07.880]  And because he had the advice of the great hero robert f. Kennedy jr. And uh, my question is three years later fast forward to
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:15.320]  Uh, you know, um march of 2020 and and the pandemic is taking off. Where was robert f. Kennedy jr.
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:20.760]  Why did trump, you know, a diss of you know, a diss himself from him and stop taking his advice
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:27.320]  I think and uh, and I know it's it's not a popular thing to say, but it's an issue of blackmail
[2:10:27.640 --> 2:10:34.440]  And it bill gates and the clinton's and they they had blackmail with him with jeff riefstein, and I think you know, it may be true
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:38.840]  I've never seen evidence of trump on the airplane or being to the island
[2:10:38.840 --> 2:10:45.480]  But I mean trump is acting like he's blackmailed russell. I appreciate your call great points. Uh, let's jam in another one here
[2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:51.880]  I'll say let's take a call from shane south carolina. You're on the air shane
[2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:58.920]  Hey, Alex, how are you? I'm in the fights where I wanted to be so it's it's definitely interesting
[2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:04.200]  That's me too, buddy. Well, I just wanted to absolutely say yes trump has to
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:10.040]  Come out against this vaccine or the jab or whatever and I believe he will
[2:11:10.520 --> 2:11:16.360]  My husband seems to believe he's compartmentalizing and working with the voters and that may be true
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:20.600]  But his base is watching and so if trump is listening your base
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:24.200]  Can be a blessing or a cut or a curse, you know
[2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:29.240]  So yes, it's your toy and um back to trump again
[2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:36.040]  I believe he had to do warp speed. I think their plan was to keep a slot down for quite a long time much longer than we were
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:39.720]  I don't believe that he knew that this was a poisonous jab
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:46.600]  Um, and I believe absolutely he has to come out. He has to come out or all of us
[2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:51.000]  Will turn the other way he will lose every single one of us period
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:54.840]  Shae, thank you so much for the call. Thank you so much for calling
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:11:57.720]  Let's talk to matt in new york matt go ahead
[2:11:59.480 --> 2:12:05.640]  No, what's up? I think gotta the main problem we got is that we're looking at uh individual pieces of the puzzle
[2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:08.120]  instead of putting the puzzle together
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:15.160]  And realizing that we had not one representative for us that's supposed to be detecting us from stuff like this
[2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:19.240]  to put together the data that the whole thing was a hope
[2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:25.240]  And that just under ventilators alone. How do we even get the ventilators enough to charge everybody?
[2:12:25.640 --> 2:12:31.640]  You're putting something with a 90 kill rate for a lung infection. I mean, Alex, you're a smart guy. I love you brother
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:36.280]  But I mean if we look at the data the cold and the flu went away
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:38.680]  I mean, where did it where did it go?
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:43.000]  Which is which is you know what I mean? Like what like someone has to help me out because I
[2:12:43.480 --> 2:12:48.600]  I don't see this cold this thing. I just see a big hole. It was it was definitely all hyped up against to take the poison shot
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:55.880]  Yeah, I mean that that's that's all I see man. I mean like I'll debate anybody now and I'm a reproductive construction worker
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:13:01.000]  But I mean, I'm looking at you're smart brother. You got straight stars. So what do we do?
[2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:05.720]  We got it. We have to try a whole government has to stand
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:11.720]  We are on trial and tell us why did we get locked down for a lung infection?
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:20.680]  Okay, why did why did you promote ventilators with a 90 percent kill rate for absolutely the wrong treatment for
[2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:24.600]  Well, it was done because they wanted to start the war against small businesses and the collapse of the world economy
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:29.640]  Which is now accelerated. Thank you, Matt. Great points. Wes in Kansas. Thanks for holding go ahead
[2:13:31.320 --> 2:13:33.640]  Hey, Alex, nice to see you for 20 years. Um
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:38.280]  I can't help my man with trump fan and I love him
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:42.040]  But I can't help think about maybe he's part of the plan because
[2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:48.920]  You know, think about everything he's done when he was in office, you know, we still have issues with immigration taxes federal reserves
[2:13:49.400 --> 2:13:51.400]  You know and now with the vaccines
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:57.240]  So, you know that makes me think maybe he's part of the plan and he's going along with it
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:02.360]  I mean, I think if he doesn't start coming out now, he's with the plan no matter what I mean
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:05.640]  I think it's proofs in the pudding here. That's why we're talking about this
[2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:11.000]  Yeah, absolutely because all the key issues haven't changed, you know, it's so I mean
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:14.920]  We where where do we go?
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:21.320]  Powerful points to my friend. Thank you for calling. We're jamming in as many calls as possible. Matt in massachusetts. Go ahead
[2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:24.680]  Hey, what's up, Alex? How you doing good brother? Go ahead
[2:14:25.560 --> 2:14:30.120]  Uh, I think uh, I think that uh, trump has the majority of the blame here because
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:32.840]  He chose to listen to Anthony Fauci his
[2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:39.240]  Uh, history with azt and aids was out there. He chose not to um, partner with the frontline doctors
[2:14:39.640 --> 2:14:44.440]  And listen to what they were saying. I mean, he chose to listen to the pharmaceuticals and start warp speed
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:50.200]  Why didn't he call other doctors around the country and hospitals and say, listen, what's happening here?
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:54.920]  Who was this affecting? He would have known that it affected mostly older
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:15:00.520]  Comorbid people and he could have stopped this in its tracks at that time
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:04.440]  We needed a leader not a follower. We needed somebody to
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:06.040]  um
[2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:12.920]  Stop the vaccine and say listen. Let's just wait six months. Let's see what's happening. I told my mother the same thing
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:15.240]  She was indoctrinated by the msn
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:21.640]  She said I need to get the vaccine so I can visit my grandkids. I said wait six months just wait
[2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:24.200]  And that's what we needed trump to do
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:29.800]  Be a leader and he wasn't and he failed us and I was a big trump supporter
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:31.800]  No, I hear you and I appreciate your call
[2:15:32.520 --> 2:15:38.680]  And you're absolutely right. The point is they're now openly setting him up. And so then bill gates and fouchy get off
[2:15:40.200 --> 2:15:43.560]  Somebody wants to like say get rid of trump or defend trump forget trump
[2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:46.200]  We need him to like go after the real people that did it
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:50.360]  Because I know he didn't mastermind this that's all I'm talking about
[2:15:51.240 --> 2:15:53.560]  All right, we'll be right back with mtg

[2:20:52.040 --> 2:20:57.240]  We've had it happen steve annan said it happened, but now they're going to hurt and the person took credit
[2:20:57.800 --> 2:20:59.800]  national losers reporting because
[2:21:00.440 --> 2:21:03.720]  mtg doesn't want to sterilize little girls and little boys
[2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:08.600]  So to give us the exclusive breakdown is mtg. God bless you congresswoman. Tell us what happened
[2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:11.960]  Alex, thanks so much for having me on
[2:21:12.280 --> 2:21:18.840]  I got swatted last night because of the legislation that I introduced protect children's innocence act
[2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:23.480]  And whoever this person is they are going to hunt him down and find him
[2:21:23.960 --> 2:21:28.760]  They called the 911 center and reported that someone had been shot in my home
[2:21:29.160 --> 2:21:31.160]  And that there were children in my home
[2:21:31.240 --> 2:21:36.360]  And created a scenario that there was still an active shooter in my home police, of course
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:41.560]  Our great local law enforcement here in rome came to my house as fast as possible
[2:21:41.560 --> 2:21:50.280]  But prepared for an unknown situation and swatting is extremely dangerous. The intent of it is to get someone killed
[2:21:50.760 --> 2:21:54.600]  I is sitting member of congress was their target
[2:21:54.920 --> 2:21:57.720]  They wanted to get me killed and that's why they called the police
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:03.000]  But alex, I want to tell you um our our local police here are they're the good guys
[2:22:03.400 --> 2:22:08.680]  They really are the good guys and and they handled everything really well, but it really scared me
[2:22:08.680 --> 2:22:15.320]  Um, and I can go into detail about how that played out. Lay that out and then let's talk about the scumbag and took credit for this
[2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:20.440]  Absolutely, it was just after one o'clock in the morning. I was sound asleep
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.560]  In in my bed in my home here in rome georgia
[2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:29.960]  Heard knock on the door heard a doorbell heard people outside my house. I could hear them outside my windows
[2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:37.720]  And um, I got it quickly. I got dressed. I I saw a few lights outside, but it wasn't police lights going
[2:22:37.720 --> 2:22:40.680]  I could just tell there were cars out there where they shouldn't be
[2:22:41.160 --> 2:22:44.600]  Um, and and I actually before I left my bedroom
[2:22:44.680 --> 2:22:52.200]  I picked up my gun as I always do to answer the door. Um, and I was well, yeah, you're a you're a major target
[2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:56.760]  Yeah, yeah, you're gonna come to my house and I don't know you're coming
[2:22:56.760 --> 2:22:59.160]  I will answer the door with my firearm
[2:22:59.800 --> 2:23:06.760]  And and that's what people should do, but I I had this really strange gut feeling alex that that something was wrong
[2:23:06.760 --> 2:23:11.560]  So I put my gun down and it's odd for me to do that. That's not normal
[2:23:12.040 --> 2:23:20.280]  Uh went down the hallway went into my foyer and saw police out on my front porch and they looked extremely serious and very concerned
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:25.560]  Opened the front door and they immediately asked me is everything okay, ma'am. Are you okay?
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:29.000]  And of course I was shocked and I I didn't know what I was
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:36.520]  Getting into I didn't know if they were bringing me bad news or or or you know come for for whatever reason
[2:23:37.080 --> 2:23:41.160]  And um, I said I said, yeah, I was I was sound asleep. I'm okay
[2:23:41.720 --> 2:23:46.200]  You know what's happening and that's when they informed me about the call that had come in
[2:23:46.760 --> 2:23:50.040]  Um, and I of course said I was like, please come in my house
[2:23:50.200 --> 2:23:52.360]  Please check my house and make sure everything's okay
[2:23:52.920 --> 2:23:58.280]  My my daughter woke up and she came out and of course she was scared too. We both were
[2:23:58.280 --> 2:24:05.480]  Uh, because it's really terrifying to to have um, you know, please come to your home in the middle of the night
[2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:13.000]  With a story like that and to know, uh, that you're being swatted and the police knew it too. They said, yeah, you're being swatted
[2:24:13.480 --> 2:24:16.360]  And alex here's that here's the issue that makes me so angry
[2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:20.520]  Not only does it put my life in danger and my family's life in danger
[2:24:20.760 --> 2:24:25.720]  It also puts the police officers lives in danger and and that makes me very angry
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:31.400]  But I have to tell you our our police here. They are amazing. They did a really good job
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:36.600]  They they understood the situation took it very seriously made sure my home was safe
[2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:42.680]  Um, they're continuing to watch it and and I was about to say my experience being swatted over and over again
[2:24:42.920 --> 2:24:45.720]  We have talked a lot about it as the police start watching your house more
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:49.720]  And and start protecting you even more because they realize you're being targeted
[2:24:49.720 --> 2:24:54.600]  Yes, they do and they're wonderful. I mean
[2:24:55.320 --> 2:25:00.600]  Alex our local law enforcement. These are the good guys. They keep they get the crime off of our streets
[2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:03.080]  They they they protect children
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:07.880]  They you know, they go after the real criminals and drug dealers and all the problems we have
[2:25:08.280 --> 2:25:14.120]  But they are are lacking resources and they're lacking manpower. Well, that's right while they were your house
[2:25:14.200 --> 2:25:16.760]  There was car wrecks and robberies they could have been dealing with
[2:25:16.760 --> 2:25:21.480]  Exactly exactly and it's it's it's such a waste of resources
[2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:24.520]  Um, and that's you know, here's what it is. So in my situation
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:30.760]  Considering the fact that this this sicko wanted to have me killed by police at my own home
[2:25:31.080 --> 2:25:37.240]  And was willing to use the police to do that to me. Uh, it's really it's really political terrorism, Alex
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:39.320]  That's what this is political terrorism
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:45.160]  Because they think that they're going to scare me and intimidate me into into not pushing
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:49.240]  Not pushing my legislation and protecting kids, but I'm going to tell you Alex
[2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:54.920]  I am I am more committed to it than ever before if they want to declare war on me like this
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:25:59.000]  Then they don't understand who I am if I do anything at the end of the day
[2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:03.720]  The only one thing I care about is protecting our kids and the left's disgusting
[2:26:04.760 --> 2:26:10.040]  perverted radical evil agenda to force kids into these these horrific
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:16.040]  Uh mutilation general mutilation surgeries is something that I'll go all the way for
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:20.520]  And they've got a problem even bill mars turned against them even mainline democrats
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:25.960]  States are passing all these laws people are really waking up to this pedophile agenda
[2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:32.600]  That's what it is not just rape a child but steal their identity and then take away parental rights and have them sterilized
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:36.200]  Or or mutilated. I mean this couldn't be a bigger issue
[2:26:36.200 --> 2:26:43.560]  I totally agree and Alex to me. It's like this. It's like the line in the sand for the republican party
[2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:49.400]  If republicans can't get on board and stop this then what what are republicans even worth?
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:51.560]  I can't imagine a more important
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:56.840]  Um, uh issue to to create a federal law to protect kids from this
[2:26:57.640 --> 2:27:01.640]  Disgusting like you said it is it is like pedophilia. It is child abuse
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:07.560]  And we have federal laws that protect kids from child abuse sex child abuse trafficking all of these things
[2:27:07.800 --> 2:27:09.800]  We need to protect our kids
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:14.200]  That are under 18 and stop stop this industry the profit
[2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:18.280]  Um, and we need well what's worse than raping a little girl or a boy
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:26.040]  Tricking them into signing up to have their genitals cut off. I mean this this is beyond pedophilia. This is literally a
[2:27:26.680 --> 2:27:27.800]  demonic
[2:27:27.800 --> 2:27:29.800]  child abuse cult
[2:27:29.800 --> 2:27:37.000]  Yes, it is it is a it is a sick cult that is right child abuse cult and they're making a fortune off of it
[2:27:37.320 --> 2:27:42.440]  And it's an industry that will only grow and they want to use federal tax dollars to fund it
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:49.160]  That's another thing that is absolutely discussing and then you know, there's an issue of some some of my colleagues are arguing with me
[2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:54.600]  Saying, you know, this is really a state rights issue. No, it's not it's not a state's right issue
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:57.240]  I'm a big believer in state rights. I believe in state rights
[2:27:57.240 --> 2:28:00.680]  I believe in state rights, but if states want to legalize slavery again, they can't do it
[2:28:00.680 --> 2:28:05.000]  We already had a civil war that they want to legalize chopping children's genitals off. We're gonna have another war
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:11.800]  Yeah, people are not going to stand for this especially alex if you think about states like california
[2:28:12.120 --> 2:28:17.720]  Where they want to take away parents rights to protect their children from this discussing agenda
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:23.480]  So kids aren't safe in california. That's why this is not a this is not a states rights issue
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:27.960]  This is a federal issue and it is our duty 100%
[2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:33.720]  You're a hundred percent right. I mean, it's it's a federal issue when there's child abuse happening

[2:32:58.360 --> 2:33:04.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:17.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[2:33:17.720 --> 2:33:19.720]  live from austin texas
[2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:21.720]  Broadcasting worldwide
[2:33:22.360 --> 2:33:24.360]  It's alex jones
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:31.560]  So last night after this individual called in a fake report of a shooting with children at margaret telegreens
[2:33:32.200 --> 2:33:34.200]  home in georgia
[2:33:34.760 --> 2:33:36.760]  It came out that
[2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:41.080]  The roam floyd 911 says the person called because they're mad at her
[2:33:41.640 --> 2:33:44.680]  For her transgender legislation to ban sterilizing
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:48.920]  Children, which is just eugenics by another name. That's why they swat teamed her
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:50.920]  But i wanted to show you
[2:33:51.480 --> 2:33:54.600]  Just a couple of the current things in the news of how sick this is
[2:33:55.240 --> 2:33:57.240]  This is mainstream news
[2:33:57.640 --> 2:34:01.880]  They're doing this to kids boston children's hospital says a link to the news
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:05.320]  Cut off flesh from a girl's forearm and thigh
[2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:10.760]  And remake that into a non-functioning penis
[2:34:10.760 --> 2:34:21.080]  This is just mutilating children. This is like hellraiser stuff sex change clinics sponsored conference that pushes child transgenderism
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:26.120]  World's youngest transgender model to trans parents
[2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:29.880]  That's just some of this so margaret telegreen
[2:34:30.360 --> 2:34:35.880]  You had more to say about this in your legislation to ban this garbage and why the left is so incredibly angry at you
[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:41.880]  Yeah, so, you know, they think they're intimidating me with their political terrorism. I'm going to tell you something right now
[2:34:42.120 --> 2:34:47.160]  Alex, uh, they can't intimidate me as a matter of fact, they've made me dug it big and even harder
[2:34:47.480 --> 2:34:50.600]  So my bill is to protect children's innocence act
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:56.360]  Um anyone watching this what you can do is you can call your your representative in the house of representatives
[2:34:56.600 --> 2:35:00.280]  And tell them to cosponsor my bill. We need every single republican on it
[2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:07.400]  Uh, because we have to start the push right now so that when we take back the majority in january
[2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:12.520]  This is a bill that we can get passed and I believe we can do it, especially if we're in charge in the house
[2:35:12.920 --> 2:35:18.920]  So it's the protect children's innocence act make sure that your your representative knows about it
[2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:23.720]  And we also need we need a bill in the senate too. We need a republican in the senate to step up and do it
[2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:28.280]  Um, I've already talked to blake masters in arizona. He says if he's elected he'll introduce it
[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:31.880]  Um, so we have brave senate candidates that are willing to do it
[2:35:31.880 --> 2:35:35.400]  And I want to see I would love to see some of our current senators, uh,
[2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:36.360]  Introduce it as well
[2:35:36.360 --> 2:35:41.320]  But we need every single republican on this bill and it needs to be promoted. It needs to be passed
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:46.760]  We need a federal law to stop this child abuse and protect children from those horrific images
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:51.400]  You just showed us because it is truly it. It truly is a sick and evil
[2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:55.880]  Um attempt to destroy children and and radically change that
[2:35:55.880 --> 2:36:00.280]  Into something they they never want to become. Uh, so it's so important
[2:36:00.280 --> 2:36:04.120]  Well, if I came into a hospital as a full grown adult and said, I want you to cut my left
[2:36:04.600 --> 2:36:07.960]  Arm off they put me in a mental institution or I said, I want you to cut my finger off
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:13.880]  But oh cut a little girl's arm off and then make it into a fake genitals. I mean, it's just it's it's it doesn't even make
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:16.840]  It's insane and they're just doing it and it's incredible
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:21.160]  And it's time to start saying no and that's happening. You're leading the charge. We're so proud of you
[2:36:21.160 --> 2:36:25.320]  Uh, you wanted to talk about the difference. We talked during the break between federal and local law enforcement
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:30.200]  Yes, there is a difference now the left has the defund the police movement
[2:36:30.600 --> 2:36:37.160]  Which we know is causing lawlessness all over america and the crime the crime rates are the proof
[2:36:37.160 --> 2:36:43.560]  This is exactly what they want. They want lawlessness. The democrats the left are the party of lawlessness
[2:36:44.200 --> 2:36:47.800]  Um, because they thrive on chaos now. I had recently said
[2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:55.800]  Defund the fbi after they raided marlago now what I'm talking about with defund the fbi is we have got to gut these federal
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:37:01.560]  Agencies of these unelected bureaucrats that abuse their positions of power
[2:37:02.200 --> 2:37:08.760]  To target politically target their enemies and this is something that our federal government should never become should never be
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:11.800]  As a matter of fact, this is exactly what our founders
[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:17.560]  Learned us against. Uh, but what we have to do alex's republicans is we can't just talk about it
[2:37:18.200 --> 2:37:22.760]  Um and say it on the news. We can't just hold uh committee hearings and investigations
[2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:27.160]  So that republican members of congress can pump out their five minute c-span clips
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:29.800]  We need real action and accountability
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:35.320]  Following what we find out and what we expose because otherwise what is the point?
[2:37:35.560 --> 2:37:38.360]  What is the point of having the majority?
[2:37:38.360 --> 2:37:41.480]  And actually controlling and having power if we
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:46.360]  Use and stop the weaponization of the federal government
[2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:51.960]  Against their enemies and against the innocent american people. It has to end and we have to do something about it
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:54.360]  Well, that's why they're so scared of you
[2:37:54.360 --> 2:37:58.680]  Shifting gears fouchy leaving berks admitting the shots didn't work
[2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:04.280]  Uh, the willensky the current head of the cdc saying, okay, we lied to you
[2:38:04.280 --> 2:38:07.720]  It was the democrats tried forced inoculation the democrats that pushed lockdown
[2:38:08.040 --> 2:38:09.480]  Trump just said if you want to take it take it
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:13.560]  But I really want to see trump now that the rats are leaving the sinking ship come out and point out
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:17.400]  It was bill gates and fouchy of them. I see the thing hurting trump more than anything
[2:38:17.400 --> 2:38:19.400]  Which I don't want to happen is that he hasn't
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:24.760]  Come out and admitted that he was lied to just big picture. What do you make a fouchy leaving?
[2:38:25.800 --> 2:38:29.080]  Well, what I make a fouchy leaving is I see it coming out of the fouchy
[2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:34.840]  Make a fouchy leaving. Well, what I make a fouchy leaving is I see it completely different
[2:38:34.920 --> 2:38:39.880]  I don't I don't think fouchy gets to just decide he's done it gets to go home and enjoy retirement
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:44.520]  No, I don't think so. This is the man that lied to us on television every single day
[2:38:44.760 --> 2:38:49.160]  He lied under oath to congress and in congressional hearings in the house in the senate
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:52.280]  He has lied and lied and he was completely
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:55.720]  Involved in a in a total part of our tax dollars
[2:38:55.720 --> 2:39:02.600]  Going towards this gain of function research creating the covid-19 virus which was created in the wuhan lab
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:07.720]  The the the virus gets unleashed all over the world. It has killed millions of people
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:14.760]  I mean you think about the the elderly elderly our grand our parents and grandparents that died in nursing homes alone
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:17.480]  People that died in hospitals alone
[2:39:18.200 --> 2:39:23.720]  People that were forced to take this vaccine that dr. Fauci promoted and promoted and promoted and alex now
[2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:29.000]  We're seeing the vaccine does nothing for them and the people that are vaccinated quadruple vaccinated
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:34.280]  They're the ones getting covid over and over again. It's not us. I'm not vaccinated
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:41.240]  I've had covid one time and I have not had it sent and we don't know what it's doing to people's bodies the mRNA
[2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:48.600]  Vaccine technology and we've seen doctors and many medical experts come out and warn against it
[2:39:48.600 --> 2:39:54.520]  And then they're canceled by big tech. We have the the VAERS system. Let's talk about that for a second alex
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:56.120]  I also have a bill
[2:39:56.120 --> 2:40:04.040]  To to justice for vaccine victims act what it does is it investigates all of the reports of vaccine injuries and death
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:09.960]  Deaths on VAERS and there's so many these people are being silenced and ignored while
[2:40:10.200 --> 2:40:15.080]  Pfizer has the liability protection and gets to just make a fortune
[2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:20.280]  And so much money off of these vaccines that were mandated and forced on
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:24.520]  On countless numbers of americans and that should have never happened
[2:40:24.840 --> 2:40:32.360]  So when I when it comes to dr. Fauci and and anyone in the cdc and anyone in our government agencies and our federal government
[2:40:32.680 --> 2:40:37.960]  You know what they should be held accountable. Fauci doesn't get to go home. He should be put in jail
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:42.600]  That is exactly where that man belongs and other people that were involved in that
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:48.440]  They should go to jail because millions of people died and millions of people were forced to take a vaccine
[2:40:48.440 --> 2:40:54.600]  They didn't want to take and have suffered. Um, they suffered miscarriages. They have suffered myocarditis
[2:40:55.160 --> 2:41:01.080]  They have suffered neurological problems. The list goes on and on and on and then there's people that have died and know when it's
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:07.000]  You're not allowed to talk about that. Oh, no, you can't talk about it because if you talk about it, then oh, you're spreading
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:12.760]  Uh vaccine misinformation. Well, you know what? I don't really give a damn. I think we need to talk about it
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:18.120]  It has to be talked about because people's lives were affected and people potentially died
[2:41:18.440 --> 2:41:22.840]  And when that needs to be investigated and if they and all of that is true, which I believe it is
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:30.520]  Then people should go to jail and dr. Fauci is top on that list. Absolutely mtg for america dot com

[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:46.120]  When you dig my grave
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:48.920]  Would you make a shallow
[2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:52.520]  So I can feel
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:54.520]  Oh
[2:47:57.240 --> 2:48:02.200]  Well, california has officially announced banning all gasoline and diesel engines
[2:48:04.520 --> 2:48:06.520]  Yeah, it's on
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.160]  Nobody else is doing it. We're just being shut down
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:14.600]  But folks are striking back and my state isn't perfect, but i'm proud of texas
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:23.880]  Go woke get the hell out texas bans wall street giants black rock credit swiss and others over energy boycott
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:29.080]  It's a big zero hedge article. We're posting it to info wars.com black rock bmp
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:36.520]  Credit swiss and others are among the first firms. The texas has just issued what will now be banned from working
[2:48:38.040 --> 2:48:40.520]  With the state due to their hostility to energy industry
[2:48:40.520 --> 2:48:48.280]  And for almost a year of suspense that caused banks business in texas and multi municipal bond issuance avoidance firms
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:56.040]  Which status is unclear amid the probe bloomberg reports that glenn haggar the republican state comptroller on wednesday
[2:48:56.600 --> 2:49:00.440]  Name the firms he will prohibit from entering into the most contracts with the state
[2:49:00.760 --> 2:49:07.480]  That's local entities after the office found the boycott of the fossil fuels sector. This is the opposite of scg's
[2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:13.880]  scg's are where they get local state and federal national governments around the world to say you can only spend money with the globalist
[2:49:14.360 --> 2:49:17.000]  And all their failed stuff designed to destroy civilization
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:19.640]  This is saying we're not doing business with you
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:22.920]  And this is how you strike back
[2:49:23.480 --> 2:49:30.280]  More than 150 firms were sent detailed inquiries requesting information on whether they were shunning the oil and gas industry
[2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:35.000]  In favor of sustainable investment financial goals. Remember, they're not doing drilling in texas now
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:37.800]  But they're doing it in saudi arabia venezuela
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:42.760]  As a reminder the survey was triggered by g.o.p. Back state law
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:45.160]  That took effect on september 1st 2021
[2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:52.920]  Which limits texas governments from entering into certain contracts with firms that have curbed ties with carbon emitting energy companies
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:56.520]  And it goes on from there
[2:49:56.520 --> 2:49:59.720]  So larry think it's not a happy new world order camper
[2:49:59.720 --> 2:50:04.360]  Here is the announcement by the comptroller in texas
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:07.800]  This is some good good
[2:50:08.280 --> 2:50:10.280]  good news
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:12.520]  And list all the companies banned from doing business
[2:50:13.080 --> 2:50:17.480]  With the state they want to cut our energy off. We cut them off from the taxpayer
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:20.440]  Meanwhile ministry of climate change tridot
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:26.600]  Installing weapons armories interrogation rooms for climate police force. What did they say?
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:29.400]  A few years ago during the lockdown they said next
[2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:32.920]  Is carbon lockdowns and green police?
[2:50:34.040 --> 2:50:41.480]  Big article up on info wars.com. You should share it because just because you know it doesn't mean other people don't and i'm not patronizing you i'm just saying
[2:50:42.680 --> 2:50:48.520]  Stop thinking you're just an audience member. I know most of you know that but for those that don't you are the victory
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:51.640]  If the situation was hopeless
[2:50:51.640 --> 2:50:59.240]  The propaganda would not be necessary such a big article this we could do. I mean the detention camps the interrogation centers
[2:50:59.400 --> 2:51:04.840]  I mean this alone with their they're admitting it. I mean this is a three hour four hour show right here
[2:51:07.640 --> 2:51:09.640]  I mean this is incredible
[2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:14.840]  Then you see that super bowl ad from 12 years ago and you realize it's not a joke
[2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:21.000]  Macron warns of the end of abundance as France faces difficult winter says it's for the earth to cut carbon
[2:51:21.240 --> 2:51:23.240]  They want to make you poor by
[2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:25.880]  Design and then I had the article here
[2:51:26.840 --> 2:51:29.960]  For some reason I can't find it. Well, you guys punch it up. It's on info wars.com
[2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:35.080]  California bureaucracy announces regulations to ban gasoline
[2:51:35.640 --> 2:51:40.280]  And diesel engines starting next year phased into the next decade
[2:51:40.280 --> 2:51:49.000]  By listing carbon dioxide as a deadly poison top story on m4s. That's just it refresh go to info wars.com
[2:51:50.120 --> 2:51:52.120]  I'm pulling my phone actually
[2:51:52.120 --> 2:51:55.400]  Yes, there it is. California demands sale of new gasoline powered
[2:51:56.040 --> 2:51:58.040]  cars by 2035
[2:51:58.200 --> 2:52:00.840]  But the key is it's being phased in now
[2:52:03.080 --> 2:52:06.120]  And they don't have the power plants to even charge the electric cars currently
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:10.280]  Electric cars are dozens of times more toxic than gas powered cars
[2:52:10.280 --> 2:52:13.720]  But the car companies are following orders for Chevy dodge
[2:52:14.040 --> 2:52:17.720]  They've all announced no more gas cars within five years
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:21.800]  And they just canceled the hellcat challenger and the hellcat dodge
[2:52:22.440 --> 2:52:29.080]  And I've owned both those cars as a therapy animal just the rumbling of that hemi engine is very relaxing
[2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:32.840]  Uh, so there you go ladies and gentlemen
[2:52:32.840 --> 2:52:40.680]  Unbelievable developments on every single front
[2:52:43.400 --> 2:52:45.400]  And then I've got stories like these
[2:52:46.280 --> 2:52:48.280]  another u.n official
[2:52:48.520 --> 2:52:50.360]  arrested for rape
[2:52:50.360 --> 2:52:52.360]  Charges dropped because they have diplomatic
[2:52:52.360 --> 2:53:02.760]  Immunity isn't that just cute you and diplomat dodgers new york city rape rap thinks diplomatic immunity
[2:53:02.840 --> 2:53:05.960]  And it just goes on and on and on from there
[2:53:06.920 --> 2:53:08.920]  But then I see stories like this one
[2:53:09.720 --> 2:53:13.560]  Sometimes I say a picture tells a thousand words. This tells a million words
[2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:16.200]  that weird
[2:53:16.200 --> 2:53:18.200]  demon creature
[2:53:18.520 --> 2:53:20.520]  That's running for the senate
[2:53:20.520 --> 2:53:22.520]  in pennsylvania john fetterman
[2:53:22.840 --> 2:53:25.320]  Is now in new videos where he can't even talk?
[2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:28.840]  Well, that's a prerequisite to be a new world order minion like biden
[2:53:29.800 --> 2:53:31.800]  john fetterman speaking
[2:53:32.520 --> 2:53:36.040]  In complete sentences continues to be a struggle
[2:53:37.080 --> 2:53:42.840]  The guy is a total tyrant and he's one of the main people with the democrats in texas that run the border
[2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:47.480]  Smuggling hundreds of thousands of children into a black hole in pennsylvania
[2:53:47.480 --> 2:53:50.440]  That ladies and gentlemen is your enemy
[2:53:51.320 --> 2:53:53.720]  That ladies and gentlemen is a demon creature
[2:53:54.280 --> 2:53:56.280]  on display
[2:53:56.920 --> 2:53:59.160]  At every single level now. Let me hit this
[2:54:01.640 --> 2:54:04.760]  Because this is a big big deal
[2:54:07.160 --> 2:54:10.360]  You knew this was coming and you know a man buys enemies
[2:54:10.360 --> 2:54:19.080]  The very same law firm that bankrupted remington is quarterbacking all the lawsuits against us
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:23.960]  But i'll be in trial in three weeks in canada kit where the judge already says i'm guilty
[2:54:25.560 --> 2:54:32.280]  Is quarterbacking the lawsuits for 27 billion dollars against the state of texas
[2:54:33.560 --> 2:54:36.760]  The local police chief ordered the police stand down the state police showed up
[2:54:36.760 --> 2:54:42.200]  30 minutes into it. I'm not absolving them, but taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for that
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:45.080]  It's not the police job to protect you. It's your job to protect you
[2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:51.000]  But yuvaldi was terrible, but the same ambulance chasers that don't let us be able to be armed
[2:54:52.280 --> 2:54:54.280]  Are now suing the state of texas
[2:54:55.400 --> 2:54:57.080]  the state police
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:54:59.880]  The texas rangers and the border patrol
[2:55:01.240 --> 2:55:03.640]  Well, let's sue the lawyers. They didn't show up either
[2:55:03.640 --> 2:55:08.040]  For 27 billion dollars
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:12.120]  Yeah, first they start out with remington then they go to alex jones
[2:55:12.680 --> 2:55:14.680]  And now they move on to texas
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:19.320]  yuvaldi families to sue gun manufacturer gun store as part of
[2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:24.520]  massive 27 billion dollar lawsuit including daniel defense and it gets better
[2:55:25.240 --> 2:55:32.840]  This is abc news father of yuvaldi shooting victim retains lawyer who sued makers of rifle used at sandy hook
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:34.840]  cost cough and cost cough
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:37.080]  of kinetic
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:42.840]  Meanwhile the u.s. Government
[2:55:42.840 --> 2:55:44.840]  Warned against warrantless gun checks
[2:55:45.400 --> 2:55:48.760]  One of people's houses while the border is wide open
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:54.200]  So I told you people like how are you handling it jones? What's it like, you know there?
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:55:59.880]  They come after who's in their way
[2:55:59.880 --> 2:56:04.440]  And I told you it's alex jones today. It's you tomorrow and now the taxpayer is a texas
[2:56:06.120 --> 2:56:13.000]  For these very groups are trying to disarm a beto aurora. Hell. Yes. We'll ban your semi-auto now. They want 27
[2:56:13.640 --> 2:56:14.680]  billion
[2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:21.560]  dollars of taxpayer money to pay the gun control law firms who are suing everybody
[2:56:22.120 --> 2:56:27.560]  Including people that were killed by guns and fast and furious eric holder ships the guns in secretly
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:30.440]  They come back. They kill people and these law firms
[2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:33.320]  Don't sue
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:38.200]  eric holder or obama. They sue alex jones
[2:56:39.400 --> 2:56:41.400]  They sue remington
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  It was a lesson makes sense when you get one of these rigged judges they control everything can be said they tell the jury you're guilty it happens
[2:56:50.280 --> 2:56:51.960]  They're gonna have
[2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:54.520]  Democrat-controlled jurisdictions it's like yuvaldi
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:57.240]  Tell that jury you don't give 27 billion dollars
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:04.840]  And they're gonna use that 27 billion dollars to take your guns with all these other lawyers who are suing all the gun manufacturers
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:11.720]  Now you understand what we can't let a single one of the people under attack go down
[2:57:13.560 --> 2:57:19.720]  And first and foremost amongst that is info wars.com so by a remington 700

[2:59:45.960 --> 3:00:01.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[3:00:01.880 --> 3:00:16.440]  The great founder of rock and roll off shut mary bringing us in crank it up
[3:00:47.480 --> 3:00:51.640]  All right, Kate Daly's about to take over always has an amazing broadcast lined up for you
[3:00:53.480 --> 3:00:56.280]  I don't want to just spend a few minutes on this critical issue here
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:00:59.880]  Because I get asked this on the street. I get asked this by family
[3:00:59.880 --> 3:01:02.680]  And I know I've been saying it maybe once a show the last few weeks
[3:01:03.960 --> 3:01:10.920]  We're not going anywhere. We didn't file chapter 11. We didn't charge chapter 12. We didn't we filed chapter 5
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:18.200]  Emergency reorganization bankruptcy. So they would stop lying in state courts and saying we have 400 million dollars
[3:01:18.520 --> 3:01:21.080]  We have 160 million dollars. We don't have 10 million dollars
[3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:26.520]  With all these fake judgments that are rigging to just say here's the real money in federal court
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:29.320]  It'll all be adjudicated. It'll all be found
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:31.320]  And and then we can deal with that
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:01:35.160]  Because the bankruptcy is designed to keep businesses going
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:39.480]  When people want to destroy a business which they said we want to shut alex jones down
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:43.560]  We want to silence them and take them off the air as long in our 13 week plan
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:46.600]  That's already started
[3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:51.160]  We're profitable and can show money that'll be paid to these people who cares
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:54.040]  It's not about money
[3:01:54.040 --> 3:01:56.200]  Oh, so I won't get paid hardly anything and
[3:01:56.200 --> 3:02:01.320]  Whatever extra profit it is will go to these gun grabbers. I mean it just it's a tax on truth
[3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:06.280]  We will stay on air. Which is their main goal is to silence us so it won't happen
[3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:09.960]  So that's what's going on info war store.com

[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:33.960]  Going your honor. We want it shut down. We want them closed
[3:02:34.280 --> 3:02:39.400]  And the judge is like well federal law says we're you're a creditor the judges found jones guilty, which is tyranny
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:42.840]  But you want money and they're like no, we don't want money. We want jones
[3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:46.120]  Silence we want to take him out. We want to deplatform him
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:53.480]  We want to silence him as a message to everybody else. They've been very honest about it and
[3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:56.200]  We didn't have products of supply chain breakdowns the last year
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:02:57.480]  It was just
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:02.360]  God's will that right as we did bankrupt see all these products were coming back in so now we're going to meet those goals

[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:28.280]  Glimbeck's job before he was even higher. They tried to replace rush limbaugh with me
[3:03:29.560 --> 3:03:32.440]  I I mean I had the talks with fox news and roger ailes
[3:03:33.240 --> 3:03:36.840]  15 years ago 10 years ago. I was offered it all dumbasses
[3:03:36.840 --> 3:03:44.440]  I'll use money as a weapon. I don't mind a good steak or a nice car in a house. It's okay, but I won't sell out nothing
[3:03:45.160 --> 3:03:47.160]  for even my life
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:52.840]  They could put a gun to my head or my children and say sell out of the new order and I'll tell them pull the trigger

[3:06:02.280 --> 3:06:06.920]  Welcome back to the alex joneshow. I'm your guest host cake dally from cake dally radio.com
[3:06:06.920 --> 3:06:14.360]  So glad to be here with you today and I have several things. I want to talk about number one student loan announcements just made
[3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:23.560]  number two companies that are already starting to implement the great reset by stopping the production of diesel vehicles
[3:06:24.280 --> 3:06:27.880]  And some climate change questions for you that are so obvious
[3:06:28.520 --> 3:06:30.520]  Well, I know why they're not talked about
[3:06:30.680 --> 3:06:33.640]  In mainstream, of course, they can never point out the obvious
[3:06:33.640 --> 3:06:39.160]  You have a bunch of talking heads with nice teeth and they can't do it. Uh, and I want to talk about a death
[3:06:39.640 --> 3:06:41.000]  I know a death
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:46.440]  But there's a good message behind this and so let's get started shall we so king fraud a lot
[3:06:46.920 --> 3:06:49.400]  Just announced that certain Pell Grant users
[3:06:49.800 --> 3:06:56.040]  Meaning most of them meaning all of them are probably going to get their $20,000 knocked off their student loan
[3:06:56.360 --> 3:06:59.720]  Okay, and if you didn't get Pell Grants, you're going to get 10,000
[3:06:59.720 --> 3:07:05.640]  Knocked off, you know, just because they love you, right and they're calling it student forgiveness
[3:07:06.600 --> 3:07:08.360]  student forgiveness
[3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:11.560]  I find that word so odd. What in the hell is forgiveness?
[3:07:12.520 --> 3:07:15.480]  Forgiveness is what you get when you break your neighbor's window
[3:07:16.520 --> 3:07:23.080]  It is not because you signed a contract to pay for something that you are receiving and then just decide
[3:07:23.640 --> 3:07:25.640]  That you don't want to pay
[3:07:25.640 --> 3:07:30.840]  But I guess that's where we're going with this. So free college here free college there's a little like Oprah
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:34.680]  You get a free college. You get some free college. Everyone gets free college
[3:07:35.880 --> 3:07:36.920]  really
[3:07:36.920 --> 3:07:38.440]  To I don't know
[3:07:38.440 --> 3:07:42.840]  I'm not quite sure why this is going on or why people aren't questioning the word forgiveness
[3:07:43.080 --> 3:07:47.160]  But I saw it again even on local broadcasts even in state news
[3:07:47.560 --> 3:07:54.120]  On the the papers everybody relies on and trusts and things that they are not part of this big newspaper cabal
[3:07:54.120 --> 3:07:56.120]  And so you signed up to pay a loan
[3:07:57.160 --> 3:07:58.920]  So you could go to college
[3:07:58.920 --> 3:08:01.960]  But you get into college and you just don't want to pay for it
[3:08:02.760 --> 3:08:05.080]  So why is every mainstream?
[3:08:05.880 --> 3:08:08.280]  Why is every mainstream outlet calling it this?
[3:08:09.240 --> 3:08:13.640]  I mean, are they providing an apology for turning you into a liberal progressive?
[3:08:14.280 --> 3:08:20.040]  Are they providing an apology for not teaching you anything that matters? Is this where the word forgiveness comes from?
[3:08:20.600 --> 3:08:22.360]  I don't know
[3:08:22.360 --> 3:08:26.920]  How does forgiveness become part of the equation all of a sudden? Why the word forgiveness?
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:32.520]  It's very very strange, right? Are we forgiving your ability to I don't know exercise your
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:35.080]  Signature on a contract
[3:08:35.080 --> 3:08:37.080]  Are they going to start doing this with everything else?
[3:08:38.120 --> 3:08:44.120]  And then what happens to that very thing when we demean it so badly that we want to offer it for free
[3:08:44.200 --> 3:08:46.200]  There is no such thing as free
[3:08:46.200 --> 3:08:48.200]  Ever and we all know this
[3:08:48.440 --> 3:08:50.440]  Everybody's paying for this
[3:08:50.440 --> 3:08:53.240]  Don't count on the journalists out there to educate anybody
[3:08:53.400 --> 3:08:57.320]  They're just going to keep calling it free and they're going to keep calling it forgiveness for a reason
[3:08:57.560 --> 3:08:59.960]  They don't want you to think it's anybody else's money
[3:09:00.440 --> 3:09:03.320]  chris an Hall the constitutional expert who I've had on here before
[3:09:03.800 --> 3:09:08.680]  Uh said this she said, you know, I've studied all through history government all through history thousands of years
[3:09:09.080 --> 3:09:14.120]  Right and what grows the fastest and greatest through the mechanism of government generosity
[3:09:14.680 --> 3:09:16.440]  government generosity
[3:09:16.440 --> 3:09:23.400]  Generosity grows the most. I love that word. It's just like forgiveness. Really. It's bizarre. Anyway, this mechanism
[3:09:23.880 --> 3:09:28.440]  Always operates by unjustly enriching some at the expense of others
[3:09:28.680 --> 3:09:32.840]  It's also interesting to note that people don't generally get upset about this mechanism of government
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  Because they think it benefits them. They're getting a piece of the pie ladies and gentlemen
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:42.120]  They're getting some of the action and whenever we get a personal piece of the action. We don't say much about it
[3:09:42.680 --> 3:09:44.680]  Right. We let it go
[3:09:44.680 --> 3:09:50.680]  People throughout history tend to get upset when government growth that unjustly enriches others at their expense
[3:09:50.840 --> 3:09:53.400]  She says how much simpler and juster government?
[3:09:53.640 --> 3:09:58.920]  Would it be if we understood that the government doesn't lawfully possess an authority to be generous to anyone
[3:09:59.720 --> 3:10:01.720]  Government does not earn its own money
[3:10:01.960 --> 3:10:03.960]  Government must take money to have money
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:08.120]  Taking money from one person to another is always considered theft
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:11.000]  Regardless of who is doing the taking
[3:10:11.240 --> 3:10:13.240]  Even when it benefits you personally
[3:10:13.240 --> 3:10:15.240]  For government to take and give away money
[3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:21.160]  The people must authorize those in government the power to steal steal their money at will at will
[3:10:22.520 --> 3:10:27.480]  This is the greatest expansion of power possible on this earth and the authority to take from
[3:10:28.200 --> 3:10:32.840]  Others whatever however and whenever you want for whatever reason you want
[3:10:33.560 --> 3:10:35.560]  government generosity
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:40.760]  Is sinful and tyrannical and we must all refuse government generosity
[3:10:40.760 --> 3:10:42.760]  It is other people's money
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:49.560]  Whether you want to recognize that or not the fact still remains government has no money
[3:10:50.200 --> 3:10:55.240]  Isn't it interesting that most of the uh from the election coup that happened most in power
[3:10:55.800 --> 3:11:01.480]  Have always worked with government. Biden has never really had a job outside of government
[3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:05.480]  Right, bernie sanders never really a job outside of government
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:12.520]  Always paid by your tax dollars and might I add in large quantities coming out very rich
[3:11:13.240 --> 3:11:17.880]  China just remember china. Anyway, so I wanted to mention this too
[3:11:18.760 --> 3:11:23.400]  The bank will end loans in australia for new gas and diesel cars
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:29.000]  And buyers will only get loans for making the right decision and this comes to us from western journal
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:33.080]  This is really important because everybody's been talking about the esg score
[3:11:33.080 --> 3:11:39.000]  I remember talking about this five or six seven years ago when we were outing a video about this
[3:11:39.400 --> 3:11:43.160]  That was going to soon turn into china's mechanism for lending money
[3:11:43.320 --> 3:11:47.240]  You get this score just like your credit score, but it's a government love score
[3:11:47.800 --> 3:11:52.280]  And people didn't believe us. They thought we were wacko. They thought we were crazy for even bringing this up
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:11:57.240]  It that could never ever happen. Well, it is happening. In fact a couple of months ago in the news
[3:11:57.240 --> 3:12:01.080]  They said it was only developing in china. No, it's there. It's there in china
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:07.880]  And so this esg score the initial stand for environmental social and governance and the scores receive the
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:14.280]  Scores that businesses receive can determine what they have access to in capital. This is what the great reset is
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:18.200]  Um and alex jones. I'm pretty sure has a book on this subject
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:24.600]  But what's interesting about the esg score and what's scary about it is that it's already being implemented around the world
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:28.120]  And everybody has some you know might have some different names for it
[3:12:28.120 --> 3:12:35.000]  But here it's the esg score. And so if you are not going to uphold the green agenda
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:39.720]  The crazy green agenda the clousy swabs of the world
[3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:43.080]  That promise us will own nothing and be happy
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:48.840]  The green agenda is all about do you buy in as a company?
[3:12:49.320 --> 3:12:56.360]  And I don't think it's going to matter what the size of the company is if you do not buy in to the lgbtq trans
[3:12:56.360 --> 3:13:01.160]  Um, you know pro trans pro everything change your business to meet these
[3:13:01.800 --> 3:13:04.680]  crazy new standards for that and to also
[3:13:05.400 --> 3:13:07.400]  Change up everything to be green
[3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:10.760]  You just won't exist because you won't get money
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:15.880]  It's like the worst fashion that you could ever ever even imagine, right?
[3:13:16.680 --> 3:13:22.520]  And so now, uh, australia comes out and they say we think that the responsible thing for us to do next
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:29.320]  Well, I'm pretty sure it's just to get more money is to ensure that our vehicle lending doesn't lock our customers into
[3:13:29.960 --> 3:13:35.560]  those bad awful high carbon emissions and increasingly expensive running costs in the years ahead
[3:13:36.040 --> 3:13:38.760]  Well, australia bank. You're so amazing
[3:13:39.480 --> 3:13:44.520]  And uh, of course, there's the all spank of australia's uh chief impact officer
[3:13:44.520 --> 3:13:52.040]  That is actually a real name not a babel on b and or the onion and they basically said this our announcement today's
[3:13:52.040 --> 3:13:57.240]  The beginning of a conversation with our customers and a signal to the wider market
[3:13:57.400 --> 3:14:02.280]  That if you're considering buying a new car you should think seriously about an electric vehicle
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:08.360]  Both for its impact on climate and its lifetime cost savings. Don't look at the sticker shock
[3:14:08.840 --> 3:14:12.040]  Don't look at the 60 thousand dollars. You're going to pay. No
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:14.840]  Just look at the impact on climate
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:17.080]  What impact?
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:20.520]  Can you identify the impact that cars have already made?
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:22.520]  I don't think you can
[3:14:23.240 --> 3:14:28.520]  I don't think you can and i'm sorry. What conversation with the customers what customers are you talking to?
[3:14:29.160 --> 3:14:32.600]  I don't ever remember having conversations like this with my own bank
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:37.240]  Hmm and a signal to the wider market. No, you're signaling the powers that be
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:41.480]  Uh to get some funding for your bank to make sure that you stay afloat
[3:14:42.440 --> 3:14:47.240]  As we progress into the the great reset. That's what it's all about and now it's starting
[3:14:47.240 --> 3:14:54.280]  So now they're warning and telling you and I think that American companies are coming next into this fray
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:58.840]  To tell you that for your own good for the responsible decision
[3:14:59.480 --> 3:15:02.840]  You're basically a nitwit that can't choose which car to own
[3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:08.760]  So we're going to choose for you and we're going to make sure that it isn't you know that awful gas
[3:15:09.160 --> 3:15:11.160]  Awful diesel how horrible
[3:15:11.160 --> 3:15:16.200]  Oh, they're so benevolent and so trying to help us make decisions
[3:15:17.400 --> 3:15:21.880]  No, they are just part of the great reset. It's plain and simple and this is starting
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:28.120]  So what are you going to do? What are we going to do? What plans do you have to circumvent this?
[3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:29.800]  How are you?
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:35.400]  Uh going to be able to make decisions in the future companies just will not be short up with funding and they will die
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:39.880]  The ones that do not complement or go all in on the great reset
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:41.880]  But that's what's so scary about this
[3:15:42.360 --> 3:15:48.440]  We don't realize that the impact of what they're doing not the impact on the environment is what is going to harm us
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:55.160]  I'll be right back. I'm your guest host for the alex jones show. I'm k dally k deli radio dot com. Be right back

[3:20:13.560 --> 3:20:17.960]  Welcome back to the alex jones showing kate deli your guest host from kate deli radio.com
[3:20:17.960 --> 3:20:26.280]  Talking about esg, I don't know if people were noticing back in 2020 when they were just trying to survive with their businesses
[3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:29.320]  And we had the havoc of a huge lie told to us
[3:20:30.200 --> 3:20:33.160]  To keep our our nation locked down and non-functioning
[3:20:33.960 --> 3:20:40.760]  That new articles were coming out about this new esg practice in china and its implications in foreign affairs
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:44.600]  Georgetown even wrote a piece on this back in 2020
[3:20:44.600 --> 3:20:48.760]  Telling us it was coming and also telling us that it would had the potential
[3:20:49.080 --> 3:20:52.360]  I had the potential to be a tool for chinese foreign policy
[3:20:53.240 --> 3:20:59.560]  They just really didn't want to talk about the fact that it was already coming here that it was already being implemented
[3:21:00.200 --> 3:21:07.640]  And there were strings attached more government money to those companies who play along and just go along with this whole
[3:21:08.680 --> 3:21:10.360]  nightmare, right
[3:21:10.360 --> 3:21:16.920]  And so they had the esg regulations globally increasing 10 fold after
[3:21:17.400 --> 3:21:22.440]  Over the last 15 years without us really realizing it the messaging was out there
[3:21:22.840 --> 3:21:29.480]  Everything was out there, but they weren't really implementing implementing until now and until the last couple of years
[3:21:29.880 --> 3:21:31.880]  And so what they were basically
[3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:39.160]  Talking about was china's securities regulatory commission in collaboration with their ministry of environmental protection
[3:21:39.160 --> 3:21:44.040]  And they introduced all these new requirements and by the end of 2020
[3:21:44.280 --> 3:21:52.120]  They were going to mandate all listed companies to disclose their esg risks associated with their operations
[3:21:52.600 --> 3:21:56.840]  So you get money you get money if you disclose what you are doing
[3:21:57.160 --> 3:22:01.720]  And and so that way they could keep track of exactly what you're doing to penalize you
[3:22:02.840 --> 3:22:07.240]  And so were they serious about instilling all these new sg regulate esg regulations?
[3:22:07.240 --> 3:22:11.960]  Of course they were of course they were and then they said that we all had to meet a global standard
[3:22:12.200 --> 3:22:14.200]  And this is how it sort of rolled out
[3:22:14.680 --> 3:22:19.000]  their move from a voluntary disclosure regime to mandatory one
[3:22:19.880 --> 3:22:21.880]  started to happen and
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:27.560]  Of course, this is going on in all different nations too. France everywhere else, right? Australia
[3:22:28.520 --> 3:22:35.880]  And so all these large firms public interest firms they had to start disclosing environmental social and employee related matters such as
[3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:39.960]  Anti bribery corruption and human rights performance
[3:22:40.680 --> 3:22:45.000]  Those are all lovely words that sound really nice to somebody without a brain cell
[3:22:45.320 --> 3:22:49.000]  But what it really was about their version of human rights is
[3:22:49.640 --> 3:22:51.640]  The green agenda
[3:22:52.040 --> 3:22:57.800]  How is that, you know going to affect everybody? So the human rights is really how green are you?
[3:22:58.840 --> 3:23:01.320]  Because that is their version of rights
[3:23:01.320 --> 3:23:05.160]  And so of course we started doing this in the uk
[3:23:06.120 --> 3:23:11.560]  And the actual disclosing actual greenhouse gas emissions and diversity and human rights whatever
[3:23:12.120 --> 3:23:14.120]  under the companies act of 2006
[3:23:14.680 --> 3:23:21.320]  And in the united states the securities and exchange commission required all listed firms to disclose their environmental compliance
[3:23:22.280 --> 3:23:24.280]  Papers, please you will comply
[3:23:24.280 --> 3:23:30.440]  So the compliance expenses so more over there's this new movement towards increasing
[3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:36.280]  ESG requirements in the sec's mandatory integrated disclosure regime
[3:23:36.680 --> 3:23:43.240]  So voluntary to mandatory which it always is they always introduce it as voluntary doesn't matter what we're talking about
[3:23:43.800 --> 3:23:48.680]  Sadly and so they started talking about it overseas the asia pacific markets
[3:23:48.760 --> 3:23:51.320]  and then it gets to where we're at
[3:23:51.320 --> 3:23:54.440]  And of course they talk about the fact that
[3:23:55.160 --> 3:23:59.480]  Reporting is voluntary in australia in japan, singapore and hong kong
[3:24:00.360 --> 3:24:07.320]  Reporting obligation is on to comply or explain you get to explain why you're not complying sure that goes over well
[3:24:07.320 --> 3:24:11.640]  Do you just disappear in china if you try to explain and not comply?
[3:24:12.680 --> 3:24:19.720]  Anyway, uh across the regions china being no exception led to an increase in the volume of esg disclosures
[3:24:19.720 --> 3:24:23.400]  Because why because companies want money and they want favors from government?
[3:24:24.040 --> 3:24:29.240]  And this is how you know uh back in the day back in the uh blovid covid era
[3:24:29.480 --> 3:24:35.720]  A couple of years ago all the companies were going all in right the signage
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:41.560]  The uh ridiculous rules the mask nazis everybody was running around showing how
[3:24:42.280 --> 3:24:44.780]  Compliant they truly are so disgusting
[3:24:44.780 --> 3:24:52.620]  Anyway, so china the top manufacturing location for 500 firms isn't that convenient?
[3:24:53.500 --> 3:24:59.660]  On it makes their performance critical right so of course they're going to bow down to china
[3:24:59.900 --> 3:25:04.380]  We're bowing down to china right right hunter right biden right thing brought a lot
[3:25:04.460 --> 3:25:10.700]  Yeah, we're bowing to them very subservient and so this of course is the new thing
[3:25:10.700 --> 3:25:19.100]  I also recognize that back in 2020. They also said five-year plan approved by the fourth session of their 12th national people's congress
[3:25:19.500 --> 3:25:21.900]  in china in march of 2016
[3:25:22.460 --> 3:25:28.300]  And it links the 2030 agenda with domestic mid long-term development strategies, right?
[3:25:28.780 --> 3:25:31.420]  Why is it? It's always a five-year plan
[3:25:32.140 --> 3:25:39.180]  You know check your city and your county for their new developing five-year plans because they seem to be in love with the
[3:25:39.180 --> 3:25:44.060]  Communist idea that everything needs a five-year plan passing budgets every year
[3:25:44.060 --> 3:25:47.020]  And you'll notice this in cities and counties across america right now
[3:25:47.660 --> 3:25:51.740]  What they do is they implement five-year plans to gouge you for them right now
[3:25:52.380 --> 3:25:57.740]  And how they do that is they say well we need we need we need could be a recession coming
[3:25:57.740 --> 3:26:03.180]  So we need these five-year plans to tax you now so that we have things later when we need them
[3:26:03.820 --> 3:26:07.340]  You know when you're passing budgets every year you don't need to do that. Did you know that?
[3:26:07.340 --> 3:26:09.340]  You simply don't need to do that
[3:26:09.500 --> 3:26:17.500]  But they're going to con you into thinking that five-year plans are just the best thing since sliced bread and five-year plans are
[3:26:18.540 --> 3:26:22.060]  The agenda agenda for everything. It's coming up in everything
[3:26:22.700 --> 3:26:27.500]  So as we're walking into this new era of esg compliance
[3:26:28.780 --> 3:26:34.060]  It takes businesses complying right because there's not enough minions to run these things
[3:26:34.060 --> 3:26:37.820]  The people that think of these things can't do it alone. They just need
[3:26:38.460 --> 3:26:40.060]  compliant companies and
[3:26:40.060 --> 3:26:42.060]  Why are they doing it?
[3:26:42.060 --> 3:26:47.820]  Well the green movement. I'd like to ask you a few questions about that. Do you know there's one question?
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:54.460]  That climate enthusiast. I'll just call them that boneheads, but enthusiasts will go with climate enthusiasts
[3:26:55.420 --> 3:26:57.420]  seem to never be able to answer
[3:26:58.060 --> 3:27:02.380]  one single question that honestly draws a blank
[3:27:02.380 --> 3:27:04.380]  and draws a face like this
[3:27:05.340 --> 3:27:07.340]  Seriously, I'm not joking
[3:27:07.820 --> 3:27:09.820]  and the question is
[3:27:09.820 --> 3:27:11.260]  over the last
[3:27:11.260 --> 3:27:17.020]  60 70 years that we've been talking about this. How has climate change affected you?
[3:27:17.820 --> 3:27:22.380]  You'll never see anyone. I'm not joking in mainstream media ever ask this question
[3:27:23.340 --> 3:27:25.340]  How has human-caused
[3:27:26.460 --> 3:27:27.820]  climate change
[3:27:27.820 --> 3:27:29.180]  affected your life
[3:27:29.180 --> 3:27:34.220]  And can you give it to me in details because I'm sure after this entire time, right?
[3:27:34.540 --> 3:27:37.500]  We went through the 70s where we were all going to be popsicles
[3:27:37.900 --> 3:27:44.860]  We went to 2013 promised by Al Gore even won the Nobel Prize that we were going to be fried eggs on the sidewalk
[3:27:45.820 --> 3:27:50.060]  How actually has climate change really affected your life?
[3:27:51.260 --> 3:27:55.900]  Look back at your last 40 30 40 50 60 years
[3:27:55.900 --> 3:28:00.620]  How have you been impacted by human-caused climate change?
[3:28:01.260 --> 3:28:05.020]  Most people can't answer this. No one can answer this. Why is that?
[3:28:05.820 --> 3:28:07.660]  Because there is no answer
[3:28:07.660 --> 3:28:11.500]  There is literally no answer your lives haven't been changed or altered
[3:28:12.300 --> 3:28:17.340]  Do you remember the gal in the 90s who was spewing climate change and she was going to be dead by the end of the decade?
[3:28:18.140 --> 3:28:22.540]  Yes, she went on to get married and have a couple kids that are pretty much grown now
[3:28:22.540 --> 3:28:28.060]  Hmm. How does that happen? How does that happen? I thought the world was going to end. We were promised
[3:28:28.140 --> 3:28:32.860]  She was screaming from the pulpit. She just ended up being what some ambassador's daughter
[3:28:33.500 --> 3:28:38.460]  Uh, that they got to come in and scream about climate change. She was the pre Gretta version. Yeah
[3:28:39.020 --> 3:28:41.660]  Uh, the free zombie the the pre zombie version
[3:28:42.140 --> 3:28:46.860]  Anyway, she went on to have a family. You don't really hear her spouting that the world's going to end anytime soon
[3:28:47.500 --> 3:28:48.300]  Nope
[3:28:48.300 --> 3:28:52.940]  And none of you have been affected by climate change human-caused climate change because it's just cyclical

[3:33:03.820 --> 3:33:17.100]  Back here with you on the alex jones show. So glad to be a part of your day today. I'm k dally your guest host and
[3:33:17.420 --> 3:33:21.820]  You know, I don't mind talking about this subject because it's such a boneheaded subject
[3:33:22.140 --> 3:33:29.900]  I hate to be mean, but if you still believe in this 60 years later, and I always say, you know, you have your your climate
[3:33:29.900 --> 3:33:39.180]  Theorists, okay. That is a true theory. They they believe a theory now to be fair. They could say the same thing about me, right?
[3:33:39.980 --> 3:33:45.660]  I think the fed the federal reserve is going to go belly up. I think I think our currency is over
[3:33:46.140 --> 3:33:49.340]  I think that government is trying to control and take liberty
[3:33:50.140 --> 3:33:53.660]  Now which one of us truly has history backing us up?
[3:33:53.660 --> 3:34:02.940]  I'm going to go with me. I'm going to go with me. I actually have history backing me up because what is government capable of? Only one thing
[3:34:03.660 --> 3:34:06.060]  They can only move forward to strip your liberty
[3:34:06.700 --> 3:34:14.860]  And to do it under lies. That's what they've always done for centuries. And when I study history, this is this is what you see
[3:34:15.900 --> 3:34:17.500]  climate theorists
[3:34:17.500 --> 3:34:24.860]  So coincidence theorists and climate theorists believe that the world is going to end for 60 years
[3:34:25.900 --> 3:34:27.180]  now
[3:34:27.180 --> 3:34:36.220]  Climate change has always put out 10 years ahead. Why is that? Well, if they did 20 years, you wouldn't pay any attention and it wouldn't catch your immediate focus
[3:34:36.540 --> 3:34:38.540]  Okay, 20 years is too long
[3:34:38.620 --> 3:34:45.500]  But if you make it 10 years that at the beginning of every decade, you're going to die at the end of every decade conveniently
[3:34:45.500 --> 3:34:47.980]  And then we start again. We start anew
[3:34:48.860 --> 3:34:50.060]  so in the
[3:34:50.060 --> 3:34:52.060]  60s in the 70s
[3:34:52.860 --> 3:35:00.620]  Life magazine time magazine was promising us that we were going to be doomed and turned into icicles and the biggest freeze to ever hit mankind
[3:35:00.860 --> 3:35:03.900]  By 1979 did it happen? No
[3:35:04.380 --> 3:35:10.220]  And then in the 80s the warming started again with gore and uh, and I'll talk about that for just a moment
[3:35:10.220 --> 3:35:15.820]  So in 1970 earth day, right earth day had its big debut
[3:35:15.980 --> 3:35:22.620]  And of course new york times had a huge article about this and it was like, oh the earth the earth the earth the mother earth
[3:35:22.940 --> 3:35:25.820]  We should all worship the earth forget about god just worship the earth
[3:35:26.300 --> 3:35:32.860]  And uh, and that and they also played the indian crying commercials and all of a sudden everybody was polluting everywhere
[3:35:33.340 --> 3:35:36.380]  Now as you were probably driving around if you were alive in this era
[3:35:36.380 --> 3:35:43.260]  You were driving around and noticing that no not everybody was polluting everything but they wanted you to think that every body of water was now
[3:35:44.060 --> 3:35:50.460]  Becoming extinct and that we were just trashing the place all of the sudden after years of never mentioning this at all
[3:35:50.780 --> 3:35:56.140]  We get to the 1970s and we have the crying indian who wasn't even an indian. He was actually italian
[3:35:56.780 --> 3:36:04.220]  Dressed up with a feather in his head to tell us that we were ruining every lake and every body of water and every piece of land in america
[3:36:04.220 --> 3:36:11.340]  And of course the epa got rolling 10,000 employees overnight and all of a sudden we had a huge agency
[3:36:12.140 --> 3:36:14.140]  To then go into the 70s to hide
[3:36:14.940 --> 3:36:19.740]  Um, what was also considered the oil shortage at the time, which wasn't actually going on
[3:36:19.820 --> 3:36:27.180]  We have plenty of reserves here, but they wanted it to look like uh to look like the world was being upended by everything
[3:36:27.820 --> 3:36:31.260]  Environmental that had to do with gas and oil everything else, right?
[3:36:31.260 --> 3:36:34.220]  And this is what started this whole nonsense
[3:36:34.540 --> 3:36:37.900]  But let me bring you back because I like to go back in history and look at headlines a little bit
[3:36:38.220 --> 3:36:47.580]  The harvard biologist george walled estimated that civilization would end by 1985 or 2000 unless immediate action was taken against problems facing mankind
[3:36:48.060 --> 3:36:51.900]  And so people heard this over and over and over again paul ehrlich
[3:36:52.300 --> 3:36:58.220]  Said population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies
[3:36:58.220 --> 3:37:05.020]  We make and the death rate will increase until at least 100 or 2 million people per year will be starving to death by
[3:37:05.980 --> 3:37:07.340]  1988 by 1980
[3:37:07.340 --> 3:37:09.740]  And it was all due to human-caused climate change
[3:37:10.300 --> 3:37:14.700]  Wow, that's amazing. Isn't it all due to human-caused climate change
[3:37:15.420 --> 3:37:21.740]  And most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in history of man have already been born
[3:37:21.740 --> 3:37:29.260]  And this was by 1975 paul ehrlich said food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation
[3:37:29.500 --> 3:37:31.980]  To famines of unbelievable proportions
[3:37:32.380 --> 3:37:39.180]  The only thing affecting our food supply is a manufactured crisis that they are doing themselves in government
[3:37:39.580 --> 3:37:41.580]  Not because of climate change yet
[3:37:41.580 --> 3:37:47.500]  We were promised from early on from the 1960s on that we would die of these things
[3:37:47.500 --> 3:37:55.020]  paul ehrlich also predicted in 1970 that air pollution is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next year alone
[3:37:55.980 --> 3:37:59.820]  Pollution cannot make a dent in climate change just like it cannot change
[3:38:00.540 --> 3:38:06.620]  The sun coming up tomorrow. There is no way to do that at all. In fact, it's completely bogus
[3:38:07.500 --> 3:38:13.420]  You can you can take companies that offer up their level of pollution and do what you want to those certain companies
[3:38:13.420 --> 3:38:17.260]  But it has nothing to do with cyclical climate change
[3:38:18.140 --> 3:38:24.780]  That is 400 cycles 800 year cycles and 1,000 year cycles. You can't do anything about it, right?
[3:38:25.340 --> 3:38:27.340]  And so of course
[3:38:27.900 --> 3:38:32.940]  Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared back in the day in the 70s by the year 2000
[3:38:32.940 --> 3:38:36.540]  We will be using up crude oil at such a rate. There won't be any more crude oil left
[3:38:36.540 --> 3:38:43.260]  Sure. Glad God made a really great world that renews itself. Anyway, they do the same thing with water too
[3:38:43.660 --> 3:38:48.620]  They treat it as if uh, you can't get water out of the ground like they did for civilizations
[3:38:48.620 --> 3:38:56.620]  but it can only come from uh snowpack and rain and it can only come um from government because government now
[3:38:57.020 --> 3:39:03.100]  Handles all your utilities and water. Don't they we've gotten used to it. It didn't always used to be like that
[3:39:03.100 --> 3:39:06.780]  We used to actually go down for primary water where it's very renewable
[3:39:07.820 --> 3:39:10.700]  So all of these lies gore was even elected
[3:39:11.500 --> 3:39:19.340]  In the 80s because of these lies because he listened to a german nazi scientist theory wasn't even fact and the guy even said
[3:39:19.340 --> 3:39:22.380]  It wasn't a fact han seuss a german scientist
[3:39:22.860 --> 3:39:25.260]  Um that said that we could be warming
[3:39:25.980 --> 3:39:29.980]  So what did he do? He rode that lie all the way in
[3:39:29.980 --> 3:39:33.180]  To his cash cow and became uh
[3:39:33.740 --> 3:39:38.140]  A person in government paid by our government making millions off of our government for
[3:39:38.620 --> 3:39:43.900]  Decades and he's still around with the same old boring story that we're all going to shrivel up from the heat
[3:39:44.620 --> 3:39:52.940]  So why does this happen? How does this happen? Well, uh, let me give you let me give you just a little snapshot of history for just one moment
[3:39:53.020 --> 3:39:59.420]  Because i'm going to ask the very obvious questions and you might want to bring this up to the climate enthusiast that you probably have in your family
[3:39:59.420 --> 3:40:01.420]  Everybody does okay?
[3:40:01.740 --> 3:40:05.340]  We've been told for 20 or more years that ice was disappearing
[3:40:06.540 --> 3:40:08.540]  So why hasn't it all disappeared yet?
[3:40:08.780 --> 3:40:13.180]  It must be on a very slow burn. So we still have lots of ice
[3:40:13.740 --> 3:40:15.100]  What's the deal?
[3:40:15.100 --> 3:40:19.420]  They can't just keep up the headline that it's disappearing for 20 years. Can they?
[3:40:20.300 --> 3:40:21.980]  Do you want the answer to that?
[3:40:21.980 --> 3:40:28.220]  Yes, they can and they do it with a smile and they do it because they think we're that stupid that we won't recognize that
[3:40:28.220 --> 3:40:30.220]  It's actually never gone
[3:40:30.540 --> 3:40:31.980]  Same thing with the polar bears
[3:40:31.980 --> 3:40:37.100]  They show a sick polar bear on the cover of time and they say oh my gosh all the polar bears are sick
[3:40:37.980 --> 3:40:41.020]  Nobody knew he was diseased that finally came out later
[3:40:42.060 --> 3:40:45.660]  But if the polar bears are dying off for 20 years
[3:40:46.540 --> 3:40:48.540]  Well, why are they all dead?
[3:40:48.540 --> 3:40:50.300]  Were they all buried?
[3:40:50.300 --> 3:40:52.300]  There should be none left
[3:40:52.300 --> 3:40:58.780]  But they think we're so stupid that we'll still believe the articles that say the polar bears are still dying
[3:40:59.340 --> 3:41:01.340]  for 20 years of his career
[3:41:01.340 --> 3:41:03.020]  Leonardo DiCaprio
[3:41:03.020 --> 3:41:04.460]  DiCaprio
[3:41:04.460 --> 3:41:09.900]  Has said that the polar bears were dying and the ice is disappearing as he flies his little fancy jet all over
[3:41:10.620 --> 3:41:11.900]  the world
[3:41:11.900 --> 3:41:13.660]  That's so interesting
[3:41:13.660 --> 3:41:16.140]  20 years of this Leonardo really?
[3:41:16.860 --> 3:41:19.580]  How do you still stand there and say it with a straight face?
[3:41:19.580 --> 3:41:27.580]  They're not buried everywhere. We're not seeing carcasses of polar bears and only one left. Are we?
[3:41:28.460 --> 3:41:30.940]  I mean come on. How many times can you tell this lie?
[3:41:31.900 --> 3:41:33.500]  right
[3:41:33.500 --> 3:41:38.700]  Can we ever look at the obvious can we ever look that these theories came from the nazi scientists?
[3:41:40.140 --> 3:41:45.580]  Hmm that we brought over an operation paperclip. What why in the world do we not talk about this more?
[3:41:45.580 --> 3:41:51.980]  Al Gore claimed his stake in the senate solely on this garbage of lies
[3:41:52.460 --> 3:41:56.380]  Why isn't he ever called out on it? In fact, he's not called out on it. He gets the Nobel Prize
[3:41:58.380 --> 3:41:59.980]  Good grief
[3:41:59.980 --> 3:42:03.020]  And you know what's what I said before as I went out of break
[3:42:03.740 --> 3:42:06.620]  Last time look you can't ask somebody
[3:42:07.420 --> 3:42:10.780]  What how has climate change affected you because it hasn't
[3:42:10.780 --> 3:42:16.300]  If climate change were a thing you would have seen in your life
[3:42:16.860 --> 3:42:21.420]  Think back on all the memories of your life. You would have been impacted by it somehow
[3:42:22.140 --> 3:42:23.740]  You never were
[3:42:23.740 --> 3:42:29.020]  It's the biggest farce the biggest lie that they've told and I agree with billionaire dan pinia
[3:42:29.100 --> 3:42:31.900]  What he says anything we do isn't to fart in the wind
[3:42:32.620 --> 3:42:34.620]  It can't be
[3:42:34.620 --> 3:42:39.820]  You can't affect anything that happens on a cyclical nature just like you can't affect fall
[3:42:39.820 --> 3:42:41.820]  All coming in later than usual
[3:42:42.380 --> 3:42:43.820]  It's cyclical
[3:42:43.820 --> 3:42:49.260]  And I went back into history and I proved it. I saw it for myself all the times we had droughts all the times
[3:42:49.340 --> 3:42:55.180]  We had families all the different times. It's cyclical. I'll be right back. I'm k dally your guest host for the alex jones show

[3:43:02.860 --> 3:43:04.460]  What they miss
[3:43:04.460 --> 3:43:11.180]  Is that this guy's a head of the curve on so many different topics of signal not noise if you look at the signal
[3:43:11.820 --> 3:43:13.820]  and you compare that
[3:43:13.900 --> 3:43:18.300]  To pbs and npr and bbc and we'll do what alex jones put out there
[3:43:18.700 --> 3:43:21.500]  Versus what your collective body has put out there

[3:47:14.060 --> 3:47:19.340]  Thanks for watching the alex joneshow and kate dally your guest host from kate dally radio.com happy to be with you today
[3:47:20.140 --> 3:47:24.540]  Somebody died in june and it went completely unrecognized
[3:47:24.540 --> 3:47:27.020]  He was a boy. He was 14 years old
[3:47:27.420 --> 3:47:32.140]  But he wasn't an ordinary boy and I want to tell you why I'm talking about this today. It's important
[3:47:32.860 --> 3:47:35.580]  He was homeschooled. He was taken out of the system
[3:47:36.220 --> 3:47:38.220]  So he could flourish
[3:47:38.460 --> 3:47:43.100]  And he took care of his disabled parents and his autistic older brother
[3:47:44.540 --> 3:47:47.420]  And he even wrote an autobiography
[3:47:48.220 --> 3:47:50.220]  Don't tell me I can't
[3:47:50.620 --> 3:47:52.620]  Don't tell me I can't
[3:47:52.620 --> 3:47:58.540]  And it was written by his pen name Cole summers. He was actually named kevin cooper
[3:48:00.220 --> 3:48:03.020]  Kevin called this his first me do it moment
[3:48:03.900 --> 3:48:09.900]  He was four years old the first time he helped take apart an engine and rebuild it before that he was helping changing
[3:48:10.620 --> 3:48:11.900]  tires
[3:48:11.900 --> 3:48:14.380]  And taking off the lug nuts at age three
[3:48:15.980 --> 3:48:20.540]  He treasured trying to learn from men in their 90s
[3:48:20.540 --> 3:48:26.300]  He loved older folks and he thought that learning from his own experience was nonsense
[3:48:26.300 --> 3:48:29.100]  He says it takes too long and you screw up too much
[3:48:30.300 --> 3:48:36.460]  And he also said I wanted to figure out what everybody else already learned so I could get a good head start
[3:48:38.060 --> 3:48:43.100]  After a cub scout trip to a senior care center, he came home and complained to his mom
[3:48:43.580 --> 3:48:47.500]  All I did was stand there and sing. I didn't even get to interact with anybody
[3:48:47.500 --> 3:48:51.180]  What 14 year old kid says that?
[3:48:53.340 --> 3:48:55.740]  Kevin was more than simply homeschooled
[3:48:55.900 --> 3:49:01.020]  He was part of a movement called unschooling where the kid is allowed to design the curriculum
[3:49:01.420 --> 3:49:03.900]  And in the beginning the coopers were happy
[3:49:04.700 --> 3:49:07.260]  To homeschool using a standard curriculum
[3:49:08.140 --> 3:49:14.460]  And they both were supervising of course, but the standard curriculum curriculum became completely irrelevant
[3:49:14.460 --> 3:49:21.020]  When at six years old Kevin discovered the instructional videos of billionaire investor Warren Buffett
[3:49:21.820 --> 3:49:27.260]  And as he told the story in his memoir, he asked his dad at six
[3:49:27.980 --> 3:49:29.980]  How do people make money? How do they get rich?
[3:49:30.940 --> 3:49:32.060]  he was
[3:49:32.060 --> 3:49:34.700]  More than just simply homeschooled though, right
[3:49:35.500 --> 3:49:40.140]  His book that he lived and died by was the poor charlie's almanac
[3:49:41.500 --> 3:49:43.500]  and of course
[3:49:43.500 --> 3:49:49.580]  Billy and atina broke the bank in order for him to buy it and at age eight after a few years of
[3:49:50.300 --> 3:49:55.260]  Packaged homeschool curriculums Kevin asked his parents if they if he could design his own lessons
[3:49:55.660 --> 3:50:01.260]  So seeing no harm in the experiment. They agreed. His focus was always on business called it an entrepreneurial
[3:50:01.820 --> 3:50:06.700]  unschooling and when friends told him they were memorizing the state capitals or the names of rucks
[3:50:07.260 --> 3:50:11.820]  Kevin would try to interest them in corporate tax law or the principles of wealth building
[3:50:11.820 --> 3:50:13.260]  and
[3:50:13.260 --> 3:50:20.220]  He launched his business empire at the age of seven by selling rabbits for meat and his parents fronted him the first five rabbits
[3:50:20.780 --> 3:50:22.780]  and helped him remodel the old barn
[3:50:23.740 --> 3:50:31.020]  And soon according to their account Kevin was selling his rabbits to restaurants in california using a traveling broker
[3:50:31.900 --> 3:50:35.900]  To deliver them and his parents still aren't sure how he figured all of that out
[3:50:35.900 --> 3:50:40.460]  But by the time he even turned eight he had formed a limited liability company in LLC
[3:50:40.460 --> 3:50:43.180]  That was bringing in more than a thousand dollars a month
[3:50:43.660 --> 3:50:49.420]  But his parents okay. He used the funds from a loan and an insurance settlement related to the rabbits to buy
[3:50:50.540 --> 3:50:52.220]  350 acres
[3:50:52.220 --> 3:50:56.540]  A fellow land near his home for a hundred and thirty dollars an acre when he was nine years old
[3:50:57.500 --> 3:51:00.700]  And then of course he went into regenerative agriculture
[3:51:01.500 --> 3:51:07.260]  At times Kevin's life resembled a party game where someone starts with a paper clip and keeps trading up
[3:51:07.260 --> 3:51:13.420]  You've heard of that the proceeds from his seven-year-old rabbit venture led to the nine-year-olds purchase of the
[3:51:14.300 --> 3:51:15.820]  $350 acre ranch
[3:51:15.820 --> 3:51:21.740]  And then he discovered a wealth of information in county property and tax records including the concept of lawyers leans
[3:51:22.860 --> 3:51:24.860]  Yeah, he's eight years old
[3:51:24.860 --> 3:51:30.140]  Lawyer who is owed money from a client can put a lien on a client's property. He figured this out
[3:51:30.860 --> 3:51:35.580]  And of course he found such a situation lawyer had totally forgotten about it offered him half
[3:51:35.580 --> 3:51:41.820]  And bought it. He actually he actually doubled his money when the property sold within a few weeks
[3:51:42.460 --> 3:51:45.820]  His next purchase was 20 acres of land for a hundred dollars an acre
[3:51:46.060 --> 3:51:51.900]  Where a woman just had simply no interest in paying the taxes on her late husband's little piece of land that he would camp on
[3:51:52.300 --> 3:51:57.180]  So he turned the two thousand dollar investment into a twenty thousand dollar trade with a well driller
[3:51:57.900 --> 3:52:02.460]  The man who kevin described as a skinny cowboy with a big handlebar mustache
[3:52:02.460 --> 3:52:09.260]  Wanted the land and kevin needed a well on his farm. So they traded for his 10th birthday kevin gave himself a house
[3:52:09.820 --> 3:52:12.300]  He found a house a piece of property
[3:52:13.180 --> 3:52:17.660]  about seven miles from his home contacted the owner she was elderly woman and
[3:52:18.300 --> 3:52:22.220]  She had turned down all the other offers, of course because she wanted to preserve
[3:52:22.780 --> 3:52:25.660]  This 700 square foot two bedroom home
[3:52:26.380 --> 3:52:28.860]  That her father built she didn't want to see it torn down
[3:52:28.860 --> 3:52:34.460]  So and she couldn't fix it at her age and she didn't want to keep paying property taxes
[3:52:34.940 --> 3:52:39.020]  So this little 10 year old struck a deal in trade for the deed to the land
[3:52:39.100 --> 3:52:42.220]  He would pay her back property taxes and her expenses
[3:52:42.620 --> 3:52:48.220]  Clear out her father's possessions from the house and he promised that he a 10 year old boy would personally restore the home
[3:52:48.220 --> 3:52:50.220]  and it took two years
[3:52:50.220 --> 3:52:56.620]  countless youtube videos that he watched and some mentoring by some older contractors no doubt
[3:52:56.620 --> 3:52:58.620]  But he did it for ten thousand dollars
[3:52:59.260 --> 3:53:05.580]  When billy put his foot down refused to let billy's the dad refused to let kevin do the electrical work himself
[3:53:05.580 --> 3:53:08.860]  He found an electrician to actually walk him through it
[3:53:09.740 --> 3:53:11.740]  He wasn't gonna not do it
[3:53:12.220 --> 3:53:16.220]  He wrote blog posts in his spare time when most kids are playing video games
[3:53:17.100 --> 3:53:19.980]  He would be up all night writing under the pen named Cole Summers
[3:53:19.980 --> 3:53:25.660]  And with all of his investments kevin socked away the loan payments tax money operating funds in the bank and never took out any money
[3:53:25.900 --> 3:53:30.140]  For himself or his family until he knew financial obligations for the year were covered
[3:53:31.100 --> 3:53:33.100]  And like any teenager
[3:53:33.100 --> 3:53:34.540]  If he needed pocket money
[3:53:34.540 --> 3:53:36.540]  He would do chores for the neighbors
[3:53:36.540 --> 3:53:38.540]  His parents said his idea of fun
[3:53:38.540 --> 3:53:42.540]  Was to hire himself out after spending a long day digging post holes
[3:53:42.540 --> 3:53:46.540]  For five miles of fencing on his ranch and laying a half mile waterline
[3:53:46.540 --> 3:53:49.580]  From a solar well to his goat paddock
[3:53:49.580 --> 3:53:54.380]  He couldn't understand why his peers or even adults around him spent so much time
[3:53:54.380 --> 3:53:58.380]  Scrolling their phones what a waste of time. He must have thought
[3:53:59.340 --> 3:54:07.260]  In 2021 he launched a go fund me campaign to raise one hundred thousand dollars to build an accessible home for his disabled parents
[3:54:07.260 --> 3:54:09.260]  Or a wheelchair bound
[3:54:09.260 --> 3:54:11.820]  He failed. He only raised nine hundred and twenty dollars
[3:54:12.620 --> 3:54:14.620]  But with all of his sets of plans
[3:54:14.620 --> 3:54:16.620]  He just considered it another learning experience
[3:54:17.180 --> 3:54:19.180]  He said if I can't earn it. I'm going to build it
[3:54:19.980 --> 3:54:25.580]  And he began gathering scrap lumber and studying building codes for adobe construction
[3:54:26.940 --> 3:54:31.340]  Even posted a video telling people that yes, in fact, he really is a 14 year old boy
[3:54:31.820 --> 3:54:33.820]  When people didn't believe him
[3:54:34.380 --> 3:54:36.380]  Can you imagine
[3:54:36.380 --> 3:54:41.500]  Accomplishing all of this and writing an autobiography by the time you're 14
[3:54:41.500 --> 3:54:45.900]  In fact, he died in june in a freak kayak accident with his brother
[3:54:46.540 --> 3:54:48.540]  His brother survived
[3:54:48.540 --> 3:54:50.540]  But he drowned
[3:54:50.940 --> 3:54:56.140]  And you know, most people would probably have never heard of kevin cooper
[3:54:56.780 --> 3:55:00.300]  Probably don't even really know who colesumers is
[3:55:01.020 --> 3:55:03.020]  He would also be kevin cooper
[3:55:03.580 --> 3:55:07.820]  But kevin cooper shows a very very big lesson to us right now
[3:55:07.820 --> 3:55:14.860]  A couple of lessons actually the reason I wanted to bring this up not only that I wanted to pay tribute to a fantastic young man
[3:55:15.180 --> 3:55:17.980]  Who I think all of us would probably admire right now
[3:55:18.620 --> 3:55:23.740]  Right to do so much for his family and to take on so much and want to learn so much
[3:55:24.620 --> 3:55:26.620]  By the young age of 14
[3:55:26.620 --> 3:55:29.580]  He's accomplished more in his life than most of us will in a lifetime
[3:55:31.100 --> 3:55:33.100]  So why am I bringing this up today?
[3:55:33.100 --> 3:55:35.100]  Well, there's a couple of reasons
[3:55:35.100 --> 3:55:37.900]  Number one, people are good
[3:55:38.460 --> 3:55:41.900]  No matter what we hear in the news every day people are good
[3:55:41.900 --> 3:55:46.460]  And you can drive across this entire country and go into every little pocket and corner in town
[3:55:46.860 --> 3:55:48.860]  And meet really good-hearted
[3:55:49.580 --> 3:55:51.900]  Wonderful people who really care to help
[3:55:53.340 --> 3:55:58.620]  I also look at kevin's life and what a model it is for taking our kids out of this
[3:55:58.620 --> 3:56:03.500]  Curriculum that destroys their brains and destroys who they are and doesn't teach them anything
[3:56:04.220 --> 3:56:10.780]  Especially with king frautalot giving out loans like candy and telling people they are dismissed from their contracts
[3:56:12.060 --> 3:56:14.060]  This kid
[3:56:14.060 --> 3:56:21.260]  Was raising himself and this kid was basically educating himself the entire way. Why because in his unschooling program
[3:56:21.980 --> 3:56:23.980]  He got to set the limits for what he learned
[3:56:23.980 --> 3:56:29.900]  Can you imagine if we gave wings to all of these kids and let them really fly? What would happen?
[3:56:30.780 --> 3:56:34.620]  I think these the youth today, you know, we tend to knock them a lot
[3:56:34.620 --> 3:56:39.420]  They're always on their phones taking selfies and everything else and they can become the butt of a joke easily
[3:56:40.380 --> 3:56:45.260]  But if you really look at it, there are many many kids out there that are figuring it out just like he did
[3:56:45.580 --> 3:56:50.220]  And many kids that if you can just get them out of the government system the indoctrination system
[3:56:50.220 --> 3:56:54.700]  You can't even imagine what they could do. I think
[3:56:56.620 --> 3:56:58.620]  And I think we need to give him those opportunities
[3:56:59.260 --> 3:57:03.260]  Get your kids out of the government schools. Let them do these kinds of things
[3:57:04.060 --> 3:57:07.420]  My heart goes out to his family and I know the how missed he must be
[3:57:08.380 --> 3:57:09.180]  and
[3:57:09.980 --> 3:57:15.980]  To him what a legacy he leaves behind of knowing what a 14 year old can accomplish in a lifetime
[3:57:15.980 --> 3:57:22.060]  And how many kids really ought to look at this as the inspiring notion that they can do it too
[3:57:23.180 --> 3:57:26.620]  We have good people in this country that really want to save it
[3:57:26.860 --> 3:57:32.380]  And we have good people working their their guts out to do it and to make a life in a living
