[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[00:08.640 --> 00:13.520]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this wednesday the 27th day of
[00:13.520 --> 00:20.560]  december 2017 only a few days left in this historic year i was not going to be here today
[00:20.560 --> 00:27.120]  i was going to take off and the incredible olyn shroyer the cuck slayer i was going to be hosting
[00:27.120 --> 00:31.920]  the transmission and he will be in a little bit later but there is so much massive news
[00:32.720 --> 00:38.080]  that wild horses could not drag me away and coming up in the next two segments i'm
[00:38.080 --> 00:43.120]  going to break down all of this critical information in great detail i'm going to
[00:43.120 --> 00:48.560]  break down the secret of why trump is preparing to move against north korea i understand why the
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.960]  president is doing it but i think a middle ground needs to be found here and i'm going to be discussing
[00:54.960 --> 00:59.360]  that coming up in the next segment there's a war coming says top marine corps general
[00:59.360 --> 01:07.280]  warns us troops this is on info wars dot com today ladies and gentlemen author who admittedly
[01:07.280 --> 01:15.760]  does meet with the cia director of cia told me it's war with north korea within 12 weeks and
[01:15.760 --> 01:19.840]  that was in november now being released because people have been authorized to basically warn
[01:19.840 --> 01:26.400]  north korea through public channels continuing report e u planning own olympic team to weaken
[01:27.200 --> 01:33.120]  national pride i first saw them propose this six years ago it's now being announced ladies and
[01:33.120 --> 01:38.880]  gentlemen along with an e u army you can't even have a team named after your nationalism this is
[01:38.880 --> 01:45.120]  globalism in its essence oh and look i didn't cover this last week when they just you know said it
[01:45.120 --> 01:50.240]  was a terrible idea and that uh i was a bad person and pulled a bunch of lies about me but now the
[01:50.240 --> 01:58.880]  chicago tribune and others are saying alex jones should be banned from chicago radio that's right
[01:58.880 --> 02:06.960]  that beyond soviet beyond communist chinese they just outright say ban alex jones from the radio
[02:06.960 --> 02:13.120]  because i'm a sandy hook denier now let me explain if i wanted to deny the sandy hook ever took place
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.280]  it's my right to do it we've held debates here a lot of our audience doesn't buy the official story
[02:17.280 --> 02:24.160]  there are major anomalies but again they threw babies out of incubators in 1990 they claimed
[02:24.160 --> 02:28.800]  their brains were stomped out turned out it was all a pr firm all a lie if i heard about
[02:28.800 --> 02:33.360]  babies thrown out incubators again to start a war i would have to question the story until it was
[02:33.360 --> 02:38.640]  verified or until it was debunked that doesn't mean if it came out that babies were indeed killed
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.480]  that i am against the babies i just don't trust known liars like cnn that spearheaded that lie
[02:44.480 --> 02:50.560]  along with uh the democrats and republicans in congress so again christian science monitor when
[02:51.600 --> 02:56.960]  contemplating war beware of babies in incubators oh my god the christian science monitor doesn't
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.600]  care about babies they don't care about babies that their brains back down no they're questioning
[03:01.600 --> 03:09.600]  known liars so again the democrats have gone from denying censorship to openly admitting their plans
[03:09.600 --> 03:14.240]  for draconian censorship they were planning this year if hillary would have gotten in that's a big
[03:14.240 --> 03:19.120]  deal and that's why when you spread the videos and spread the articles and spread live links to the
[03:19.120 --> 03:24.800]  show on facebook twitter youtube and the live video feeds you reach new people our am and fm is
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.880]  wonderful but we mainly reach a conservative libertarian audience there and that's about 70
[03:28.880 --> 03:34.000]  percent of our audience actually the big secret is am and fm radio it's gigantic um three four
[03:34.000 --> 03:42.400]  million a day tune in over 200 stations now that said what really matters is reaching the new people
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.000]  the people that have only seen the cliches the lies about info wars where the globalists have
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.760]  pre demonized us and and force feed this info about us on google facebook and twitter it's only
[03:53.760 --> 04:01.200]  you that can bypass that so that's coming up also trump defies media doubters by signing tax cut bill
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.320]  before christmas he was forced to before christmas as i said if he wasn't gonna sign it and also
[04:06.320 --> 04:11.600]  trump tears into golden showers dossier calling crooked hillary pile of garbage and the fbi
[04:11.600 --> 04:18.560]  tainted and the big news the big news we have more somali striking again us women stand 14 times
[04:18.560 --> 04:37.280]  by somali migrant media go dark we love our somalis we love our muslims and then i'm going to get
[04:37.280 --> 04:42.080]  into the media spinning it and demonizing that only the rich get money from this tax cut i'm
[04:42.080 --> 04:56.320]  going to give you the secret of that and more straight ahead i'm alex jones spread the word
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.680]  mike in arizona here on the air worldwide go ahead oh alex you can rent any day of the week
[05:03.680 --> 05:08.480]  thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save america
[05:08.480 --> 05:15.200]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well and as a long
[05:15.200 --> 05:21.120]  time info words listener i want to say thanks for the awesome brain force anthro plex my girlfriend
[05:21.120 --> 05:25.600]  would like to say thanks for the anthro plex thank you i use the bio true selenium the super
[05:25.600 --> 05:30.640]  blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans the super blue is awesome

[05:41.040 --> 05:47.120]  then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's
[05:47.120 --> 05:52.000]  a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and
[05:52.000 --> 06:10.240]  ourselves we can take our country back crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex
[06:10.240 --> 06:18.640]  jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war ladies and gentlemen again it is
[06:18.640 --> 06:25.200]  incredibly hard to believe that we are already in the last three and a half four days of 2017
[06:25.200 --> 06:31.840]  it is wednesday december 27th 2017 we're going to be live here for the next four hours with this
[06:31.840 --> 06:39.760]  broadcast and then we're going to have rob doing others hosting for oan shroyer but oan shroyer
[06:39.760 --> 06:43.760]  isn't on vacation he's going to be hosting the rest of this transmission coming up in about 30
[06:43.760 --> 06:50.160]  minutes but there's so much huge breaking news i had to come in first today because there's just
[06:50.160 --> 06:55.520]  just so much unfolding but of course oan will do an excellent job as well where to begin
[06:57.040 --> 07:03.120]  let me get into the situation with north korea first and just let the audience know that i
[07:03.120 --> 07:07.680]  don't want war with north korea only an insane person would want that because it could easily
[07:07.680 --> 07:15.440]  draw in russia and china but i wanted to give you trump's calculus on this because it's been
[07:15.440 --> 07:22.080]  left a bit nebulous in the media as to why this is happening it's bigger than north korea and the
[07:22.080 --> 07:27.680]  threat of north korea is obviously a lot bigger than north korea and it's beyond north korea
[07:28.480 --> 07:35.120]  basically already having icbms that can hit us territories and clearly hit the us west coast
[07:35.120 --> 07:40.480]  delivering payloads evident shows that probably can't deliver payloads to the central or eastern
[07:40.480 --> 07:45.600]  areas of the united states with those payloads coming in back into the atmosphere with their
[07:45.600 --> 07:52.880]  single warhead technology undisturbed the real reason this is happening is that under global
[07:52.880 --> 07:59.200]  strategic tension as a big new brazilian ski doctrine which was an expansion of the david
[07:59.200 --> 08:06.560]  rockefeller un doctrine of creating a destabilized world playing countries off against each other
[08:06.560 --> 08:15.440]  deindustrializing the nations and then using the crisis of war or the threat of war to consolidate
[08:15.440 --> 08:20.960]  power in the hands of the multinational corporations and their governmental combine
[08:20.960 --> 08:28.960]  combine control arms like the un like the imf the world bank and now the tpp and and that's their
[08:28.960 --> 08:37.040]  admitted globalist plan america is to be a military reservation with only military forces just like
[08:37.040 --> 08:43.040]  the classic 1970s film rollerball kind of created a hollywood style cosmology to explain their system
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.720]  where you have the energy sector and then you have the weapons sector and you have the technology
[08:48.720 --> 08:53.360]  sector and you've got the book then if you're a technology sector you have to farm that out evenly
[08:53.360 --> 09:00.400]  so no one ever gets a toehold on the other and so war becomes obsolete but from the beginning
[09:00.400 --> 09:05.760]  globalism was set up to actually cause war against the poor war against the nation state war against
[09:05.760 --> 09:11.360]  the family war against the individual and was a kind it was a deceptive fraud we have the former
[09:11.360 --> 09:16.560]  heads of the devos group and others going public saying globalism was a fraud globalism was a lie
[09:16.560 --> 09:26.080]  globalism is a giant authoritarianism and so macArthur in july of 1953 was relieved of command
[09:26.080 --> 09:33.440]  by then president uh harry s truman for refusing to let the communist chinese come in and overwhelm
[09:33.440 --> 09:38.240]  and kill our troops there at the yalu river three million came in we'd already been fighting several
[09:38.240 --> 09:44.400]  million chinese with maybe one tenth of force and kicking their butt so in came the chinese and human
[09:44.400 --> 09:48.800]  wave attacks and macArthur before they ever got nukes before they ever took over the region said
[09:48.800 --> 09:54.160]  we got to take them out now we got to deal with the communists now and he was withdrawn from command
[09:54.880 --> 10:01.840]  old soldiers never die they just fade away and that was the beginning of modern globalism as we
[10:01.840 --> 10:07.280]  see it now and the strategic tension was created and north korea was used as a set piece to prop up
[10:07.280 --> 10:15.120]  china prop up communism minister pan and control the whole area now that that said i don't want to
[10:15.120 --> 10:20.320]  have a war with north korea but they've now been given the missile secrets by the clintons and the
[10:20.320 --> 10:26.720]  globalists and now the communist chinese they've been given the delivery systems as a pretext to
[10:26.720 --> 10:32.560]  be the trigger for a future china war with the us and that's a fact china is planning that
[10:32.560 --> 10:38.240]  and they think russia is going to be drug in trump wants to do a behind-the-scenes deal to bring russia in
[10:41.280 --> 10:44.960]  and there have been previous deals behind the scenes with nixon and others where the russians
[10:44.960 --> 10:48.960]  wanted to do a preemptive strike it's also happened under eisenhower on the chinese
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.440]  and the us wanted to do a strike as well back and forth and then both sides would renege when it
[10:55.440 --> 11:02.800]  came down to the eleventh hour to launch the preemptive strike together against china so russia
[11:02.800 --> 11:08.320]  doesn't like china even more than doesn't like the us because china is right on its doorstep and has
[11:08.320 --> 11:15.440]  been a historic problem in many cases and you can look all this up this has happened throughout
[11:15.440 --> 11:20.720]  history so north korea has been put there by the globalist as a detonator and i understand their
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.560]  people are starving and i understand it's horrible and i understand these big sanctions only hurt
[11:24.560 --> 11:32.720]  them mainly and and i don't like it but i'm telling you the strategic thinking of president trump in
[11:32.720 --> 11:39.760]  all of this is that we have to look strong because the globalist the cfr that worked for the communist
[11:39.760 --> 11:44.800]  chinese hinted at this during the campaign and then once the president was president elect
[11:45.760 --> 11:51.280]  that they were going to use north korea blustering and rolling out its new weapons systems that
[11:51.280 --> 11:58.080]  had been keeping quiet to basically embarrass trump and to create a crisis for trump that he would have
[11:58.080 --> 12:05.360]  to back down from thus blunting us power globally so that we again could be vulcanized politically
[12:05.360 --> 12:11.360]  and not be the dominant world unipolar power and then i get putin wants a bipolar power and all that
[12:11.360 --> 12:15.520]  and so do i i don't want the us to be the world empire but the point is the globalist of the
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.080]  world empire right now playing off the three major power blocks and they want to be able to
[12:20.080 --> 12:26.640]  bring the united states into check and checkmate if need be with the north korean detonator so
[12:26.640 --> 12:31.040]  you're getting the real briefings the president's gotten and you're getting the real strategic
[12:31.040 --> 12:39.600]  thinking behind the whole ball wax and so by bringing this war to the fore now against china
[12:40.960 --> 12:48.320]  making russia stand down this will encircle and geopolitically break china's back as it
[12:48.320 --> 12:54.160]  attempts to roll out a global takeover from latin america to eastern europe uh too much of africa
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.360]  which china is doing via a program where it double crossed the united states behind the scenes
[12:59.360 --> 13:04.720]  politically with spies and strategic influence and financial influence with over 10 000 front
[13:04.720 --> 13:10.880]  companies inside the united states so this is all about china and it's about forcing russia
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.920]  into a new alliance with the united states that trump had already planned and been setting up with
[13:15.920 --> 13:22.240]  general flin strategically because russia's christian anti globalist and of course anti radical
[13:22.240 --> 13:28.480]  islam and putin was beginning to orbit into that believing it could happen but trump has been
[13:28.480 --> 13:34.720]  partially blocked by the neocons by the democrats by the brzezinskiites by the globalist into that
[13:34.720 --> 13:44.320]  strategic program and so right now trump is battling with the globalist in a game of super
[13:44.320 --> 13:50.160]  branksmanship with north korea with the u.s prepared to strike by february they're all
[13:50.160 --> 13:54.640]  telegraphing that and they mean it and they're go go go they're going to go it's not a bluff
[13:55.520 --> 14:02.480]  if russia doesn't stand down and side with us then china will roll over north korea will be fully
[14:02.480 --> 14:08.560]  isolated forced to sue for peace and there can be some type of new armistice and a program to begin
[14:08.560 --> 14:14.800]  merging in the next decade the north and the south and ending strategic crisis ending strategic
[14:14.800 --> 14:24.320]  pressure ending the so-called system of balkanization strategic tension is the proper
[14:24.320 --> 14:28.960]  term but they've got a lot of subterms to it so that's where this is this is trump saying
[14:28.960 --> 14:32.480]  we're not going to back both sides anymore we're not going to back radical islam we're not going
[14:32.480 --> 14:37.040]  to have fun civil wars we're not going to do this the problem is McMaster and others are globalist
[14:37.040 --> 14:41.600]  they're still working behind the scenes trying to sabotage that because trump's still working
[14:41.600 --> 14:47.200]  off a plan that others in the pentagon that are patriots in general flin and general jones and
[14:47.200 --> 14:54.480]  others had developed that trump bought into during the campaign but he's being sabotaged and because
[14:54.480 --> 15:00.960]  of that i don't think it's safe to play this branksmanship with china and russia when especially
[15:00.960 --> 15:05.120]  we've got traders within our midst and under command and control system that are communist
[15:05.120 --> 15:09.600]  chinese agents because the infiltration is not russian and if it was russia i'd say it all day and
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.240]  you know say the hell with russia russia can barely fend off the globalists and is trying to
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.200]  reindustrialize and build its population and stabilize russia is in a stabilization phase
[15:19.200 --> 15:23.040]  the globalists are mad because they can't get control of it right now just like they want control
[15:23.040 --> 15:28.080]  of the us back and only have partial control right now so that's the real strategic global
[15:28.080 --> 15:33.840]  lay of the land ladies and gentlemen that's the breakdown of this entire system as it stands right
[15:33.840 --> 15:40.720]  now and uh i think we should have a real discussion about this we'll be right back there've been more
[15:40.720 --> 15:54.560]  somali stabbings in the u.s we love our muslims oh they're so good

[22:04.320 --> 22:09.040]  quite a lot of conversations about it among the members of parliament and it was being taken quite
[22:09.040 --> 22:13.840]  seriously by some of them he said they're using the word solidarity which tends to be codeword
[22:13.840 --> 22:18.640]  for even closer union now they're talking about an e u military invading countries
[22:19.840 --> 22:26.160]  if they try to pull out which speaks to their plan to create a united states of europe now
[22:26.160 --> 22:31.600]  continuing ladies and gentlemen speaking of globalism let's get to this report that i mentioned
[22:31.600 --> 22:39.040]  earlier this is out of worldnet daily dot com us woman stabbed 14 times by somali migrant
[22:39.040 --> 22:45.360]  media go dark i see in local news every couple days were somali stabbed somebody because that's
[22:45.360 --> 22:50.880]  the culture look at somebody wrong they just stab you you know women are seen as is as animals are
[22:50.880 --> 22:57.360]  sold on slave blocks sold on slave auctions and then comedy central makes jokes and goes what are
[22:57.360 --> 23:03.360]  slave blocks very very sick people uh morgan everson was stabbed 14 times by somali man while
[23:03.360 --> 23:08.080]  walking home from december 13th there's a lot of reports out there too in germany they think
[23:08.080 --> 23:13.040]  dogs are unclean the uh the somalis do they always call them germans they go german man stabbed
[23:13.040 --> 23:18.720]  with german woman and it's some you know invading foreigner morgan everson was walking home in
[23:18.720 --> 23:24.000]  downtown minneapolis about 8 30 p.m on december 13th when a black man got out of his car chased
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.120]  her down tackled and stabbed her repeatedly the feisty 26 year old frantically fought back
[23:29.120 --> 23:32.800]  because she's racist kicking scratching and screaming for help at some point neighbors heard
[23:32.800 --> 23:37.280]  her screams came to help her attacker described as a somali man his early 20s about five foot seven
[23:37.280 --> 23:43.040]  with a slight build and wearing gray stone washed jeans ran away and then it goes on to the media
[23:43.040 --> 23:47.840]  cover up and i think it shouldn't be reported i agree i think it's racist she didn't die of
[23:47.840 --> 23:52.960]  course i'm being sarcastic here's another one abc news woman stabbed multiple times in uptown on
[23:52.960 --> 24:01.760]  walk home from work but again you're not gonna find out that it was another one of the cultural
[24:01.760 --> 24:07.280]  enrichment folks that did it now let me hit this article because this is really important
[24:08.560 --> 24:12.960]  trump signed the tax bill early and as he said in the speech he had to because
[24:13.680 --> 24:18.320]  they were saying that it was all a hoax he wasn't going to sign it trump defies media
[24:18.320 --> 24:23.360]  doubters by signing tax bill before christmas i didn't want to folks but again they said i
[24:23.360 --> 24:28.640]  wasn't keeping my promise i'm supposed to sign it in january now let's move on to this they've
[24:28.640 --> 24:34.800]  got articles it's on info wars dot com bloomberg world's wealthiest became one trillion richer
[24:34.800 --> 24:42.640]  in 2017 billionaires can thank trump for explosion wealth but see the globalists they
[24:42.640 --> 24:46.640]  they said they don't want even exploding wealth for themselves they want our wealth to go down
[24:46.640 --> 24:53.280]  that makes their wealth worth even more they want austerity they want total control and so they
[24:53.280 --> 24:59.200]  spend it like oh look the rich people got richer yeah the stock market the new jobs the industry
[24:59.200 --> 25:05.120]  but that's how we get more jobs and more factories if we have rich people that invest back in the
[25:05.120 --> 25:12.640]  culture and our austerity brokers of eugenics to consolidate wealth which is jeff bezos and zucker
[25:12.640 --> 25:19.360]  burg and bill gates and all of their own admissions so again people are saying well it's only a few
[25:19.360 --> 25:24.080]  thousand dollar tax cut for the average person and then if you have kids it's two thousand dollars
[25:24.080 --> 25:29.680]  extra per child so that's like four thousand now and okay the corporate tax goes from 38.9 down to 20
[25:29.680 --> 25:35.200]  or whatever china's still 15 it's not about what you just get right up front and even though it's
[25:35.200 --> 25:42.640]  substantive or the 50 plus companies giving extra bonuses because of it it's about the fact that it
[25:42.640 --> 25:50.800]  gets the economy going even more creates a boom which always drives up wages not with fake minimum
[25:50.800 --> 25:56.320]  wage hikes that only make jobs contracting about economy but booming economies when wages go up
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.760]  systemically historically so they know this and they've been trying to fix the economy and hold
[26:01.760 --> 26:07.520]  the country underwater and the globalists admit that so trump's job's really easy if he can remove
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.240]  the artificial globalist tariffs like us having the highest corporate taxes in the world which
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.960]  we've now done look at the stock market already exploding look at retail sales the best in decades
[26:16.960 --> 26:23.440]  eat despite amazon things are coming back and they keep going well somebody making 60 000 a year
[26:23.440 --> 26:30.160]  only gets a thousand dollars extra blah blah blah it's it's the jobs coming back it's it's the
[26:30.160 --> 26:34.720]  companies being able to move here that want to be here but had to leave because the globalist
[26:34.720 --> 26:40.560]  put in internal tariffs in the united states designed to ship our jobs overseas and bring us to heal
[26:40.560 --> 26:45.360]  and they're in a battle to implode the economy they're in a battle to stop trump so that's why
[26:45.360 --> 26:50.080]  i'm so vitriolic in defense of the president because you know a man by his enemies the globalist
[26:50.080 --> 26:56.320]  hating they're trying to sabotage our recovery that's a recovery of the country's sovereignty
[26:56.320 --> 27:03.440]  not just prosperity and the prosperity goes hand in glove with that and that's why i back trump so
[27:03.440 --> 27:09.280]  so hard so using class envy going oh look great year for the rich in 2017 yeah jp morgan chase
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.240]  made record profits goldman sacks did and despite the fact that they gave 100 of their money to
[27:14.240 --> 27:19.840]  hillary and none to trump he brought in policies that were so good for the country that their profits
[27:19.840 --> 27:27.120]  exploded but then the globalists and the socialists and the bernie sanders go look at the rich people
[27:27.120 --> 27:32.640]  getting rich you don't want that you want good rich people that bring wealth back to the country
[27:32.640 --> 27:38.080]  not globalist rich who to a man and a woman were against trump because they're greedy and want to
[27:38.080 --> 27:42.800]  consolidate and want control they don't want wealth they don't want a renaissance they don't
[27:42.800 --> 27:48.080]  want prosperity here or in russia or in china or in mexico or in india or anywhere

[33:34.080 --> 33:39.120]  there had a great christmas with loved ones and family and friends i know that i did and i hope
[33:39.120 --> 33:43.200]  everybody is recovering from those good times sometimes there's a bit of a christmas hangover
[33:43.200 --> 33:49.920]  here but one thing that doesn't have a christmas hangover is the economy and this is something
[33:49.920 --> 33:57.200]  that trended all of 2017 they think it could trend again in 2018 and there was a poll on
[33:57.200 --> 34:02.560]  drudge today that has i think maybe a quarter million votes right now it just went up this morning
[34:03.200 --> 34:09.920]  and the poll is what is the biggest story of 2017 you've got the economy boom
[34:10.560 --> 34:16.000]  hurricanes las vegas massacre russia probes sexual misconduct trump first year worldwide
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.640]  terror attacks north korea or other i went with the russia probe because this seems to dominate
[34:20.640 --> 34:28.480]  the news cycle every day however the people voted and trump's first year got over 50 of the vote so
[34:28.480 --> 34:33.600]  everybody has been following trump's first year and if you think about it as an overall story it
[34:33.600 --> 34:40.960]  is the best and i think that you know the russia probe kind of goes along with that economy boom
[34:40.960 --> 34:46.880]  gets 16 percent sexual misconduct gets 11 percent los vegas massacre gets just under seven percent
[34:46.880 --> 34:54.880]  and so on and i was thinking about this with the economy being the second biggest one you know
[34:54.880 --> 35:02.080]  that's when people go to the the voting booth despite all of the pontification and issues
[35:03.040 --> 35:10.240]  most people vote for the candidate that they think is going to do the best for them financially
[35:10.240 --> 35:16.000]  do the best for the economy i think that obviously had a lot to do with why trump won but
[35:16.800 --> 35:22.400]  you know what in fact i bet you i bet you i bet the crew could find this i bet you the stories
[35:23.600 --> 35:31.760]  that cnn and msnbc ran a year ago or just over a year ago saying trump is going to crash the
[35:31.760 --> 35:35.840]  economy i bet you they haven't even erased that in fact guys see if you can find that do you
[35:35.840 --> 35:41.760]  remember about a year and a half ago just over a year ago the story was how trump is going to
[35:41.760 --> 35:49.520]  crash the economy trump is going to crash the stock markets oh oh right right and then i've got
[35:49.520 --> 35:57.600]  i mean i've got so much financial news here it's a joke crash the economy what happened to that
[35:57.600 --> 36:05.520]  oh there's the economist the economic consequences of donald trump the economic
[36:05.520 --> 36:11.840]  consequence okay uh cutting taxes uh stock markets keep hitting records uh he's cutting
[36:11.840 --> 36:17.520]  into the government deficit spending i mean yeah these consequences i mean i don't know what i'm
[36:17.520 --> 36:26.880]  gonna do oh my gosh it's so bad so look at this stack of news that i have great again mastercard
[36:26.880 --> 36:32.400]  reports reports biggest holiday season ever and you can say is that good or bad is that just bad
[36:32.400 --> 36:36.080]  for the credit debt well regardless people are spending money consumer confidence is up and it's
[36:36.080 --> 36:44.400]  good for the economy you've got signs point to strong us shopping season that's right they're
[36:44.400 --> 36:51.200]  saying this was a record christmas season for shopping record is that because christmas is
[36:51.200 --> 36:57.040]  back is that because the economy is back is it because of both us department store stocks jump
[36:57.040 --> 37:04.320]  on holiday spending record oh there's all these financial records stock records sales records
[37:05.360 --> 37:12.240]  could 2018 surprise the same outsized gains is 2017 that's from cnc nbc oh oh i thought that the
[37:12.240 --> 37:18.000]  economy was going to collapse collapse under trump no i guess that didn't happen world's
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.160]  wealthiest become one trillion dollars richer i'm not sure how to take that of course the rich
[37:24.160 --> 37:27.840]  are going to get richer when there's more money so that's kind of a given that's like the people
[37:27.840 --> 37:33.200]  complaining oh the rich got the biggest tax the rich got the biggest tax cuts well the rich pay the
[37:33.200 --> 37:38.160]  most taxes so of course they got the biggest tax cuts then you got social security beneficiaries
[37:38.160 --> 37:44.320]  hit record almost 62 million i take that with a grain of salt because the social security program
[37:44.320 --> 37:49.280]  was about to go bankrupt a few years ago and then they extended it but this is just an example of
[37:49.280 --> 37:53.520]  government spending that we can't afford and another example of this is the welfare state
[37:54.480 --> 38:00.000]  you have unemployment hitting record lows and many departments you have food stamps usage and
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.600]  welfare usage on the decline where it was a record high under obama here's a piece put together
[38:06.320 --> 38:12.160]  to just show you the mindset of people that are on food stamps it's all about dependence
[38:12.160 --> 38:17.120]  and it's not about working for yourself it's all about entitlement and not actually taking
[38:17.120 --> 38:23.200]  responsibility here's that clip i know people they work three jobs and they live next to
[38:23.200 --> 38:28.560]  somebody who doesn't work at all and the person who's not working at all and has no intention
[38:28.560 --> 38:36.400]  of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person that's working his and her
[38:36.400 --> 38:46.240]  ass off and it's not going to happen not going to happen give me my food stamps do you really want
[38:46.240 --> 38:53.120]  to work or you just you just want to get a free check there's a sign behind you this is Waverly
[38:53.120 --> 38:56.960]  Job Center you have any intention of going in to get a job or you're just gonna get the food stamps
[38:56.960 --> 39:06.000]  not looking for a job why should i have to go work at retail and deal with snobby customers
[39:07.040 --> 39:14.240]  why why should i have to dare choose to do that we call the department of children and families
[39:14.240 --> 39:20.480]  to see what they've been doing to help DCF says Hillsboro Kids Incorporated has been helping by
[39:20.480 --> 39:27.440]  paying Adam's rent even providing her furniture Adam says it isn't enough somebody needs to pay
[39:29.520 --> 39:36.880]  yeah not me not me though somebody needs to pay for it but not me well they're your kids man
[39:36.880 --> 39:46.800]  exactly so pay for them honestly i don't want to work but i'm not going to i wonder if they
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.520]  got drug tested to get these food stamps if they'd still sign up for them okay this is not a joke
[39:52.640 --> 39:58.640]  just give me my food stamps i'm asking for they are not incapacitated in any way or they you know
[39:58.640 --> 40:04.800]  they don't have a mental or physical disability that's documented and or could be observable
[40:04.800 --> 40:09.920]  more counties will join them as federal exemptions to the requirements expire now that unemployment
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.600]  is below 10 for each affected county i felt really bad about being on food stamps for a while
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.360]  they're just for people who really really need it i thought and i'm like living this flippant
[40:19.360 --> 40:24.720]  lifestyle like in francisco do you think you really really need it well yeah and eventually
[40:24.720 --> 40:29.760]  i just sort of realized that even though i'm 24 like i still have responsibilities i still have
[40:29.760 --> 40:34.160]  like hopes for my future wait you have responsibilities or we have responsibilities to pay for you
[40:34.160 --> 40:41.600]  really need it are you i'm confused how do you feel about that i'm comfortable with it and i feel
[40:41.600 --> 40:49.840]  like i hate working from a government do you feel guilty about using your food stamp card when you
[40:49.840 --> 41:01.040]  have $850,000 in the bank no no i don't i'm i'm going by the rules and um if they need to change
[41:01.040 --> 41:06.080]  their rules they can change their rules but i don't see i'm doing anything wrong how much do you
[41:06.080 --> 41:13.760]  collect and benefit i have a feeling there's a rule change coming and i get medicaid and
[41:14.400 --> 41:25.760]  give me my food stamps so let's actually get the numbers here guys um food stamp usage hit a record
[41:25.760 --> 41:30.400]  high under obama in fact if you can find a graph that would be even better because you've got the
[41:30.400 --> 41:35.040]  graph you know it's a line graph and it's kind of slowly going up and then obama gets elected and
[41:35.040 --> 41:44.080]  it's just like a just goes just right off the chart you know and so you say well that's nice
[41:44.080 --> 41:48.960]  it's nice to help people you know they need some help even if you know they ended up in that situation
[41:48.960 --> 41:53.280]  because of themselves you know let's just help them out well see there's a problem with that
[41:54.080 --> 42:00.560]  a it sends us into more of a debt they just had the article up there food stamps up over
[42:00.560 --> 42:06.000]  70 under obama if you guys could find a graph that's really illustrative of what happened but
[42:06.960 --> 42:14.240]  the real negative consequence as far as the people are concerned is now they feel entitled
[42:15.040 --> 42:23.520]  you see once you've been granted a lifestyle that allows you to be a bum and get paid and not have
[42:23.520 --> 42:30.800]  to work and then you develop a thought process and a mental makeup that says oh well why should I
[42:30.800 --> 42:36.720]  have to take responsibility for my kids the government pays for it and that's not just rhetoric
[42:36.720 --> 42:42.960]  that is literally their thought process that is what they actually believe so then what happens
[42:42.960 --> 42:47.200]  well they can never become a contributing member of society they don't want to work they don't have
[42:47.200 --> 42:52.720]  to work they just want their entitlements so there's constant negatives to this and that's why
[42:52.720 --> 42:58.960]  trunk wants to bring jobs back so you can get these people back to work feel your body with carnivore

[47:45.520 --> 47:54.800]  had a great christmas and then in a master troll video you had benjamin net and yahoo send out a
[47:54.800 --> 48:00.480]  video i saw it on twitter i'm sure he posted it everywhere where benjamin net yahoo wished us
[48:00.480 --> 48:07.840]  a merry christmas from the capital of israel jerusalem just sticking his finger right in the
[48:07.840 --> 48:13.280]  un's eye again who is the un to tell israel where their capital is i mean give me a break
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.280]  then you have israel to name train station near jerusalem's western wall after trump
[48:19.280 --> 48:25.120]  up so there's just some news there but in the last segment you heard us talking about these
[48:25.120 --> 48:31.760]  people on welfare and on food stamps and there was one clip in there where the guy asked the
[48:31.760 --> 48:35.600]  the guy standing in line to get his food stamps there's a sign right behind him that says now
[48:35.600 --> 48:41.280]  hiring so the guy says well okay obviously you know you're a little short on money or whatever
[48:41.280 --> 48:44.800]  you're having some financial hardships that's why you're coming here to get the welfare of
[48:44.800 --> 48:48.800]  the food stamps he's like yeah yeah he's like you know there's a uh yeah there's the sign right
[48:48.800 --> 48:52.080]  behind he's like yeah you know they're uh they're hiring right behind you it's the job center right
[48:52.080 --> 48:56.960]  behind you get a job and they all just line up and they get their food stamps and they go right
[48:56.960 --> 49:04.880]  past the job center and they don't get a job so it just made me think of something here in austin
[49:04.880 --> 49:13.440]  texas austin is a expansive city right now i mean booming they can't even keep up they literally
[49:13.440 --> 49:18.880]  can't even keep up the infrastructure because the population is getting so much more dense
[49:19.600 --> 49:23.920]  they can't build enough skyscrapers they can't build enough apartments and one of the things
[49:23.920 --> 49:30.080]  that comes with that is there's a lot of jobs here a lot of jobs and sure a lot of them are
[49:30.080 --> 49:33.840]  going to be in the service industry but that's what i mean that's kind of where you have to start
[49:33.840 --> 49:40.720]  sometimes to get a footing in in the economy and in the job marketplace they don't want a job
[49:40.720 --> 49:48.240]  i'm telling you it is the craziest thing here in austin you can go through a shopping center
[49:49.680 --> 49:55.840]  and you'll see three or four businesses or restaurants whatever now hiring on the sign
[49:57.760 --> 50:01.200]  and then you leave the shopping center and there's five people begging you for money
[50:02.720 --> 50:08.720]  and and look i'm from st lewis where homeless people are actual homeless people i mean like
[50:08.720 --> 50:13.440]  they they are just it's bad for them and you can find that in austin too they have a homeless
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.640]  shelter here but there's there's homeless people in austin they're not even homeless they just don't
[50:18.640 --> 50:23.360]  want a job so they get the food stamps they get the welfare and then they panhandle on the street
[50:23.360 --> 50:30.560]  and then they live in an apartment perfectly fine they're not homeless they're bums a bunch of
[50:30.560 --> 50:36.080]  bums man i just never understood that lifestyle but anyway uh getting back to some of the news here
[50:36.080 --> 50:43.120]  here barack obama has been doing the trump follow-up tour where trump goes to india obama
[50:43.120 --> 50:47.520]  goes to india trump goes to china obama goes to china trump speaks here obama speaks there
[50:47.520 --> 50:53.360]  he's just following it up trying to you know just get a little shiv right into trump whatever he's
[50:53.360 --> 50:56.640]  trying to accomplish that's that's how obama operates because he loves this country so much
[50:56.640 --> 51:01.200]  he wants to undermine the president of course he already did that by spying on trump tower
[51:01.200 --> 51:06.320]  uh and by making sure the doj and the fbi could work behind the scenes to make sure trump didn't
[51:06.320 --> 51:13.920]  get elected yeah we'll have more on that later but barry obama sat down with prince uh harry
[51:15.360 --> 51:20.640]  and prince harry is the one that's been in the news because he's about to marry uh some actors
[51:20.640 --> 51:25.360]  from america i kind of liked prince harry when he was kind of the bad boy and went against the
[51:25.360 --> 51:30.960]  establishment now i i was questioning it and now he seems to be full on liberal and then he
[51:30.960 --> 51:36.000]  does this interview with barack obama now we're going to play a couple of these clips but it's it's
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.640]  this is hilarious to me for multiple reasons one because you're going to hear what obama says and
[51:40.640 --> 51:47.280]  it's going to be very revealing but two for the people watching this on the internet this is like
[51:47.280 --> 51:52.560]  the weirdest setup i've ever seen for an interview you would think that prince harry and former
[51:52.560 --> 51:57.520]  president barack obama could get like a nice studio like a nice podcast studio or something
[51:57.520 --> 52:04.480]  but they're like sitting in some civic center with some like old microphones it's the weirdest thing
[52:04.480 --> 52:10.880]  and it's kind of to me illustrative like you are the old guard look at that what they can't find
[52:10.880 --> 52:17.120]  anything nicer than that i'm sorry but that is they got a printer in the background i mean it's
[52:17.120 --> 52:23.440]  just like a whole awkward deal going on and i don't even care again it's just like this was
[52:23.440 --> 52:30.640]  symbolic to me your these are this is the old guard nobody cares about these people's opinions
[52:30.640 --> 52:37.920]  anymore prince harry sweet man you're gonna get married to an actress oh wow it's all over the
[52:37.920 --> 52:44.800]  tabloids whoo oh obama he's got to see that's how obama thinks he's like oh prince harry he's
[52:44.800 --> 52:48.880]  been in the news i gotta i gotta get on this podcast i gotta do something to undermine this country
[52:48.880 --> 52:54.320]  so uh let's play the uh first clip we got two of these clips let's play the first when harry
[52:54.320 --> 53:01.840]  met berry clip do i have to just be faster today no no no it's okay but i need the brooch accent
[53:01.840 --> 53:06.320]  but if you start if you start using terrible audio quality um the answers you're probably gonna get
[53:06.320 --> 53:14.880]  like it's the face the whole thing is just awkward oh okay i don't want to see that face but it's um as
[53:14.880 --> 53:20.960]  you know that for 40 minutes that'd be 20 minutes i can't even hear what they're saying for the audio
[53:20.960 --> 53:28.800]  is so pathetic and we hope to use the whole thing as a podcast okay so i'm ready when it went
[53:29.520 --> 53:34.800]  you guys have sound you guys this is sounding great we're all good yep you know your sound
[53:34.800 --> 53:39.520]  what's going on what are we talking about uh what it's it's it's it's fun i'll interview you if you
[53:39.520 --> 53:45.520]  want no no let's keep it this way i much prefer that okay so i don't know when uh prince harry
[53:45.520 --> 53:49.600]  became a journalist but somehow he lands the interview with obama uh let's go to uh by the way
[53:49.600 --> 53:54.640]  again that's their that's their actual audio i mean that's that's the awkwardness of this whole
[53:54.640 --> 54:00.000]  thing now let's go to the second clip we share the same kind of mindset and the outlook on on on the
[54:00.000 --> 54:06.720]  charitable sector uh on on foundations and mainly on on the youth of the youth of today the young
[54:06.720 --> 54:12.960]  people of this world are incredibly inspirational well enough to invite him to your wedding oh i don't
[54:12.960 --> 54:17.280]  know about that that's um the we haven't put the uh the invite all the guests that's all we want to
[54:17.280 --> 54:20.560]  care about is the wedding you know who knows whether you can be invited to a royal wedding
[54:20.560 --> 54:25.520]  that's surprise stop the presses it's a royal wedding all right so that was actually a second
[54:25.520 --> 54:31.360]  interview uh there were two two things that obama said here that i found funny i'm just going to
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.760]  read them to you directly this is a quote from obama from the interview i still care about
[54:35.760 --> 54:41.120]  making sure the united states in the world is a place where kids get a decent education uh what
[54:41.120 --> 54:45.360]  did you for the inner cities in chicago and their school system where people who are willing to work
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.760]  hard are able to find a job that pays a living wage now that's funny because wages went down
[54:49.760 --> 54:54.640]  and unemployment went up under obama so i guess he's just a miserable failure that we're conserving
[54:54.640 --> 54:59.040]  the amazing resources of our planet that future generations can enjoy the beauty of this place
[54:59.040 --> 55:03.600]  like we did uh that's a strange way of putting we're going to shut down america's energy sector but
[55:03.600 --> 55:12.080]  okay but here's the real ditty this is the one that just gave me butterflies inside obama says
[55:12.640 --> 55:17.200]  one of the dangers of the internet is that people can have entirely different realities
[55:18.160 --> 55:24.160]  what they can be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases see don't you
[55:24.160 --> 55:30.880]  see you can't think for yourself the internet is a open flow of information that may force you to
[55:30.880 --> 55:35.760]  analyze and and critically think you can't do that obama and the news is supposed to do that for
[55:35.760 --> 55:41.360]  you he goes on the question has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a
[55:41.360 --> 55:47.120]  multiplicity of voices allows a diversity of views but doesn't lead to a balkanization of society
[55:47.120 --> 55:53.520]  and allows ways of finding common ground and he goes on to talk about how everyone basically used
[55:53.520 --> 55:59.520]  to get their news from three sources and how that was better it was better when people only got
[55:59.520 --> 56:03.520]  their news from three sources that way everybody knew what was going on and there weren't these
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.720]  different realities now that we have because of the internet because of twitter in fact guys look
[56:08.720 --> 56:13.680]  for this in fact i just remember look for the clip of matt lauer interviewing george bush this is
[56:13.680 --> 56:18.960]  one of the greatest moments in television history where matt lauer mentioned something about the
[56:18.960 --> 56:24.000]  internet news uh you know getting trump elected or whatever and george bush was like yeah you know
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.720]  back when there were only three news outlets you were actually relevant and then you can see the
[56:28.720 --> 56:32.640]  face on matt lauer he wasn't you know he wasn't locking anyone in his office at this time so
[56:32.640 --> 56:37.040]  he was just doing an interview and you can see his face he's like oh it's like a gut blow president
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.040]  bush is laughing he's like yeah you used to be relevant before the internet because that's the
[56:41.040 --> 56:49.280]  point they are irrelevant they have no relevance their only relevance was in their ability to
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.960]  control and manipulate information so now that the internet has caused them to lose that ability
[56:54.960 --> 57:02.080]  they tell you you can't think for yourself it's dangerous to go on the internet and look at info
[57:02.080 --> 57:08.960]  wars you might see something there you don't know about i'm sorry when was the last time any of the
[57:08.960 --> 57:14.720]  major news networks covered wiki leaks you wouldn't get any of that that's why the internet is good
[57:16.320 --> 57:23.840]  yeah there's the clip so it's amazing to me that they are literally freaking out right now
[57:23.840 --> 57:30.320]  they wanted net neutrality so they could shut down their competition in the information war
[57:30.320 --> 57:38.080]  they didn't get it hillary would have done it but now obama is telling you stay away from the
[57:38.080 --> 57:43.520]  internet it might be dangerous it might cause you to think critically and then you might have a
[57:43.520 --> 57:50.640]  different opinion from that guy you can't have that maximize your potential and take your body

[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.840]  oh insurer here filling in for alex we're going to take some of your calls in the next hour
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.280]  roger stone hosting the fourth hour but did you know there were actually planned terror attacks
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:24.240]  over christmas that got foiled that's right here's our own leon macadoo breaking it down
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:30.640]  there's new information coming out on the would-be domestic terrorist everett erin jameson
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:37.760]  he had planned to carry out a christmas day attack at pier 39 in san francisco uh he was arrested
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.880]  by the authorities after he told the fbi of his plan to carry out this atrocity he said it would
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.160]  be perfect the pier would be packed with people so he's obviously mentally ill but this guy is a
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:54.720]  former us marine who converted to islam two years ago and paul joseph watson is now reporting
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:03.280]  that he was also an anti trump antifa supporter um he was recently liking a lot of uh different
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:11.040]  antifa groups on facebook um berkeley antifa antifa california sacramento um and he was also
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.640]  liking a number of other far left pages including trump resistance movement things trump supporters
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:24.880]  say us democratic socialist uh he also loved the young turks cnn buzzfeed aljazeera and he was
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.240]  also sympathizing with a number of other pro muslim pages this is interesting because it shows
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:37.120]  that jameson's political ideology was kind of a mixture of radical far left thinking and islam
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:43.120]  now watson points out how the media is reporting about the fact that jameson had recently been
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:49.120]  liking pro-terrorism content on facebook that he was showing his support for that isis inspired
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.400]  halloween truck attack that took place in new york but what the media is not telling you
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:02.800]  is the fact that he's also liking and linking with cnn buzzfeed and these antifa groups anti
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:11.120]  trump groups and as we have reported back in 2015 the isis manifesto black flags from roam
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:17.440]  actually encouraged its supporters to go to these far left protests and link up with these
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:24.960]  leftist activists because they talk about sharing broadly the same goals as radical islamists do
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:31.200]  european muslims are lying with left wing activists how will this happen have you ever
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:37.120]  been at a pro-palestine anti-israel protests you will see many activists who are not even muslims
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.080]  who are supportive of what muslims are calling for the fall of zionism it is most likely here
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:47.280]  that connections between muslims and left wing activists will be made and a portion from them
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:53.120]  will realize that protests are not effective and that armed combat is the alternative so they
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:59.120]  will start to work together in small cells of groups to fight and sabotage against the financial
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.440]  elite and so now we're actually starting to see that taking place as well back in november paul
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:11.360]  joseph watson was tweeting about a recently released fbi field report that antifa radicals
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:18.400]  were meeting with islamic terrorists to obtain weapons and training and that they have improvised
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:24.080]  explosives being stored on college campuses so why is the media failing to talk to you about the
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:30.560]  would-be terrorist connections with antifa well let's not forget that we have just recently had
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:38.160]  a spate of glowing reports of antifa what to wear to smash the state is it okay to punch a nazi in
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.920]  the face who are antifa they're just these little political whippersnappers that are standing up to
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:50.000]  fascism of course they failed to link their readers to this fbi field report showing that the
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  antifa is receiving weapons and trainings from isis or radical islamists they also failed to
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.840]  mention how the activities of antifa have been officially labeled domestic terrorist activities
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.880]  by the department of homeland security who is worried about the increasing violence
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:14.160]  happening within this far left group bet your bottom dollar if this want to be domestic terrorist
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.360]  uh ever at jameson had been liking alex jones and info wars and other right being conspiracy
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.520]  websites that would be front page news alex jones has done it again he's radicalized another
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:32.320]  would-be domestic terrorist but no they don't want to draw your attention that these people are more
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:38.720]  aligned with the political ideology that's being spouted off over at places like cnn and the young
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:49.200]  turks and buzzfeed and the the democratic socialist of america and isis oh and you won't believe
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:59.760]  what cnn is doing now we'll be right back please listen carefully because i'm about to point out

[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:20.160]  worldwide it's alex jones president trump has said he hopes to unify the country have you in the
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:26.560]  first month seen him do or say anything that in your opinion would be an attempt to heal the wounds
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.480]  of the election well first of all there's only been one month in office and so it's a you know he's
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.280]  got four years secondly i think you have to take the man for his word that he wants to unify the
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.680]  country and we'll see whether he's able to do so it's hard to unify the country though with the
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:46.080]  news media being so split up when i was president you know you mattered a lot more mattered a lot
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:53.600]  more mattered a lot there's george bush telling rat lauer this was not rat lauer locking him in his
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.640]  desk like he apparently did with uh you know interns or whatever uh this is george bush telling
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.880]  rat lauer right to his face you're irrelevant bro sorry you're irrelevant and that's why obama
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:10.240]  uh in his interview with prince harry was saying it's too bad that everyone doesn't go to three
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.800]  sources for news anymore we can't control the information we used to be able to control the
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.280]  information we could get away with starting wars like the golf of tonkin incident we could get
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:24.640]  away with lying about weapons of mass destruction it was so easy for us then to lie to the american
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.440]  public and then just eat it up because we controlled all the news sources but now with the internet
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.520]  and info wars well we don't know what to do it's out of control they're actually getting the sources
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.960]  they're getting the information out there to the people and the people are thinking for themselves
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.080]  we need to shut this down and that's what hillary would have done had she had gotten in office now
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:49.440]  this is this has really been tough for cnn cnn in fact i don't know if cnn had its worst year
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:56.960]  ever in ratings this year but it was bad it was bad they got eclipsed by msnbc now can you imagine
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:07.680]  rachel madow beating you in the ratings a literal cartoon character cut out of man dark
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:16.800]  so she now beats cnn that's how pathetic cnn is so what is cnn doing they're going full tmz full
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.000]  paparazzi and this also shows you how obsessed they are with donald trump oh you think cnn hates
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.440]  trump they may but they are obsessed i get don lehmann cnn would live in trumps pocket if they could
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.600]  don lehmann would live in trumps underwear yeah i'm gonna say he would he would live in trumps
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:41.520]  underwear just so he could report on a fart so here's cnn a reporter hiding in the bushes to film
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:47.600]  president trump playing golf i'm angry tweety the president was back at it once again so there's the
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:53.520]  image this is from cnn there's someone hiding in a tree they're literally hiding in a tree to get
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:00.160]  this footage of donald trump playing golf he was also going after i mean talk about sad no news to
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:06.080]  report on no family to celebrate christmas you're gonna hide out in the bushes i don't know who that
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.920]  cnn reporter was but maybe he should go work for tmz because i think they're actually doing better
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:17.280]  than cnn now but folks the reason why we are competitive the reason why they freak out because
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:23.920]  info wars exists is because we're supported by you we aren't supported by big advertising firms
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.680]  we aren't support we don't get any i mean google ads won't even put us on there anymore they just

[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:01.520]  cover some of this news here oh oh you know i'm a little upset because
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.680]  i've always kind of been a proponent for global warming i've never really liked winter
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.280]  much i don't even really like snow i did have a white christmas in st lewis but snow i'm not a
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:17.520]  fan of snow so i like the fact that i moved down to austin here and i barely have to put up with
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:23.360]  any winter but boy this this global warming thing is just failing miserably international
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:30.160]  falls minnesota drops to record low negative 37 degrees near record cold new year's eve
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:36.960]  expected in new york city unforgiving cold snap will engulf eastern two-thirds of the nation
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.560]  throughout new year's day let me just let's just look at some of these temperatures we're expecting
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:47.760]  here over the weekend and so our audience across the states can be like wow we're about to get a
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:55.680]  record low here minneapolis is expecting a low of negative 15 milwaukee expecting a low of negative
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:03.600]  two st lewis expecting a low of negative nine uh i lived in st lewis for 26 years and i can only
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:10.480]  think of two other occasions when it was consistently in the negatives so that is very rare okloma city
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:18.240]  negative one low dallas is expecting a low of 11 chicago negative one detroit four cleveland 11
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:24.560]  indianapolis minus five i mean the list just goes on and on so i guess that global warming thing
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:31.040]  isn't working rats that's too bad i was kind of hoping for it i kind of wanted beachfront property
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.640]  in st lewis or austin or wherever i mean everywhere's going to be a beach when global warming kicks in
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:45.600]  you know the amazing thing about it is you have people the reason why global warming is
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:52.080]  beyond politics and why people get so angry about it is because it's it's it's actually about earth
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:14:00.400]  and it's about survival and it's about humanity where the liberal media complex with you know
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:07.520]  president obama al gore and such other figures have sold the false bill of good saying that we
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.800]  don't care about the planet we're killing the planet coal's killing the planet mining's killing
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:18.080]  it's all killing the planet it's all global warming and you say okay well maybe there's
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.720]  some stuff to that okay let's have an open conversation about it but they don't have an
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:28.720]  open conversation they give you fake formulas that you you can't even they just make formulas up
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:34.880]  up they fabricate the measurements of temperature that they get in some of these locations
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.800]  but why am i even talking about that all you have to do see this is the craziest thing
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:46.000]  they they they virtue signal and they tug at the heartstrings of these poor soul-sucked humans
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:52.160]  that fall for fake news and they say trump doesn't care about the planet earth republicans don't
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.840]  care about earth can you believe that that is the most evil thing ever they don't even care about
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:02.000]  the planet they'll kill us all and you say well okay well who do you trust well al gore has been
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.240]  calling on well wait a second let's go back and let's look at al gore's documentary an
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:13.920]  inconvenient truth from just over 10 years ago everything he said is wrong everything he said
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:20.720]  is wrong and they still give him a platform they still give him a podium and he still flops his
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:27.520]  gums telling you we need to do something about global warming oh but oh but now they ratchet it back
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:34.720]  it's not global warming now it's climate change it's climate change well yeah so oh climate change
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:40.960]  deniers no we were the ones saying it was climate change while you said it was global warming so
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:48.240]  technically the climate change deniers are now the ones pointing fingers saying you deny climate

[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:31.840]  from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:42.320]  oh and shroy are filling in for alex today i've noticed an interesting trend in the last couple
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:48.560]  of months and you may have noticed this too what happens is it's like honestly the whole russian
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:55.360]  collusion thing is the best example of this but to be more specific the media reports on something
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:02.720]  because of political biases and because they want to have a self-fulfilling prophecy so they report
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.480]  on something over and over like the russian investigation or the russian collusion they
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:13.520]  report on something over and over and over and then they think it's real and so now they've
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:19.840]  they've basically planted a seed of lies in their own head that they water themselves with misinformation
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:28.960]  and so what happens is they get confused and they don't understand what's going on because
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:36.480]  nothing that's happening in reality is actually matching what they've built up in their own mind
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:43.440]  because of the confusion that they've essentially instilled in themselves so in a in a smaller example
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:49.920]  here is a the nb nbc broadcast where they're whining about being confused because they don't
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:56.320]  understand the tax bill the new law limits property tax deduction to just ten thousand
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:03.120]  dollars in 2018 but homeowners in high tax states and cities who prepay next year's bill before the
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:09.920]  end of 2017 may save money may because it depends on a number of factors something accountant matt
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:16.240]  meyer has had to explain to his chicago area clients in a deluge of panic phone calls it's
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:21.600]  ridiculous tax season started a month or early you know usually in the month of december we're
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:27.280]  going on vacation we're taking the easy work this year meyer and his team are spending their time
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:32.160]  explaining the new law it means something different for absolutely every single person a tax bill
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:38.800]  is supposed to simplify things and uh it really hasn't many taxpayers don't realize that the changes
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:45.280]  won't be a factor in this year's returns they'll see the full impact come april 2019 and for anyone
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:50.720]  looking to make those prepayments on property taxes they'll need to check in with the tax collector
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:58.080]  in their hometowns in montclair the office will be open on saturday frank the takeaway is that if
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:03.280]  you are confused you're actually not alone reach out to a professional get an accountant oh you're
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:08.160]  confused if you don't have one have them look at your financial situation and give you some advice
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:14.400]  and maybe steer clear of that advice at the holiday dinner table depends on your family but good
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:20.560]  advice yeah you know if you're confused at how uh donald trump won the election i don't know why
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:25.360]  i mean we just told you hillary was gonna win the whole time uh you know if you're confused why
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:29.360]  trump hasn't been brought down for russian collusion even though we've been talking about it and
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:33.040]  there's a special counsel here if you're confused well yeah i don't know why you're confused on that
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:39.440]  it's just because we've been reporting it obviously it's true if you're confused by this tax bill
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:45.440]  because trump is actually going to cut taxes then uh you know we we're confused too we don't understand
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.160]  no this is they think that they can have a self-fulfilling prophecy by reporting on a story
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:57.520]  that doesn't exist no matter what happens no matter whether it's positive or negative about trump
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:02.400]  they put their spin on it and then it's never accurate so then their audience of course is
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:06.640]  confused because they haven't told their audience anything that's real and then they're just saying
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:12.720]  it's okay to be confused it's okay yeah they pat them on the head ah oh you're confused it's okay
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:17.200]  we're confused too we don't understand it make america great again we don't get it either we
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.840]  don't get it why would we want to make america great america being great we don't want that
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:30.240]  now here's what's not going to be confusing this is when the daily caller today nearly
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:42.400]  450 000 people fled these three deep blue states in 2017 folks there is about to be a tax refugee
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:49.600]  scenario if you live in new york chicago or illinois i have a feeling that they are about to be
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:59.440]  losing population because here's what's happened i don't understand i i honestly don't understand
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.440]  someone that has a problem with what donald trump did for the state and local taxes except selfish
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.520]  purposes which okay you want you don't want to you know you don't want to pay as much taxes i get it but
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:17.840]  why should see this is a crime to me how is it that states like new york and illinois
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:26.800]  and california get to wantonly spend and spend and spend and have sanctuary cities and have
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:32.400]  massive welfare states so that they tax their people into oblivion so that they can port they
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:40.960]  can you know bring in non-citizens and support them and so trump says look you have not been paying
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:47.600]  your fair share of taxes and that's the truth if you lived in new york or illinois or california
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.880]  or one of these states that has a huge state tax you haven't been paying your fair share
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:59.200]  you have been getting a cut now you have to pay as much as the rest of us that's going to suck
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:06.160]  and now maybe you're going to rethink those welfare states or you're just gonna move which is what
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:12.080]  we're already seeing happening and it's going to happen again so yeah if you're in new york
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:18.320]  and you had to pay 12 000 in state and local taxes you get to write that off of your federal
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:25.040]  taxes and then you don't pay them well i'm sorry that's not fair why should i have to pay more
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.520]  because you want to have a sanctuary city in california why should i have to pay more
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:35.600]  because ron emmanuel wants to have a sanctuary city in chicago so i i just don't understand
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.800]  and it's i mean i could name names here but big mainline conservatives are ticked about it
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:47.120]  it's not my fault you move to california and live there it's not my fault that governor
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.320]  moonbeam brown out there is just raising your tax he's not even there after time so what does he
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:27:01.920]  care he didn't pay the taxes anyway so i'm expecting this number to grow 450 000 fled deep blue states
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:09.840]  in 2017 i bet that i bet that number grows in 2018 and doesn't that just tell you what democrats
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:20.160]  do to cities what democrats do to states they destroy them look at any inner city in this country
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:26.720]  that has been run by democrats for multiple decades baltimore chicago st lewis name the city
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:32.080]  in california what's happening they're all broke the inner cities are are infested with gangs and
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:38.800]  violence and drugs and oh oh well you know we're gonna have gun laws in chicago well then how come
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.800]  there's a shooting seemingly every week and i think there were five shootings over christmas day
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:52.880]  weekend in chicago so if you want to know the real story here that you already knew democrats
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:59.360]  destroy things they destroy economies they destroy cultures they destroy societies they
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:05.040]  destroy the family they destroy race relations they destroy the school systems they destroy
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.520]  everything that's why they have a d next to their name it's not democrat it's destroy and now they
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:16.720]  want to destroy america now they want to destroy trump now they want to destroy a tax cut so i'm
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:23.600]  expecting the tax refugees to maybe even approach close to a million in the year 2018 because these
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:28.960]  people and they're probably clueless they don't have a clue in new york or california or illinois
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.400]  how they're just getting bent over by their state for these taxes because they're paying for non-citizens
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:41.200]  in sanctuary cities and welfare states oh oh you mean oh wait you mean now that you have to pay
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.320]  for the sanctuary city you mean now that you have to pay for the non-citizen now that you
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.520]  have to pay for the welfare state you don't like it now that you have to pay for it you don't like it
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.920]  oh shocking i wonder who's felt that way

[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:13.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:36.800]  anything and everything they think they can a trump tack on attack trump on they will it doesn't
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:42.160]  matter if it makes sense if it's a non-existent story they'll just go after trump because that's
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:50.560]  how filled with hate and rage and lies they are and now you've got this msnbc i guess he's a sports
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.440]  editor or commentator or something saying that trump is racist because of his comments on the
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.400]  nfl here's that clip dave let me ask you really quickly about some of the uh the accusations
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:05.520]  that the president's comments have had racial undertones to them when you think of some of the
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:13.120]  msnbc just obsessed with race and many of them uh prominent people are obsessed with race that the
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.600]  president has uh given he's he's categorically denied that this has anything to do without race
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:23.600]  but just pause it for a second these people are so obsessed with race see they don't get it
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.400]  most conservative i'm not saying race is written but but the average conservative
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.760]  or let's just say trump let's just say donald trump when he looks at someone
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:39.200]  he's not saying oh it's it's a black person or it's a hispanic person or it's a white person
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:47.840]  he just sees a person these liberals these people on msnbc cnn these are the people obsessed with
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.520]  race see the first thing they think is what color the skin is and then they immediately
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:58.800]  make a hundred judgments based on that these are the real racists you want to tune into racist news
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:04.640]  go to msnbc go back to the clip cited here uh in the article it seems that there is a racial
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:11.040]  just race race race baiting a racist race obsessed over race race race race it's not a dog whistle
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.360]  it's an air raid siren if you look at some of the people in the sports world who've actually been the
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:20.880]  most critical of donald trump uh pause it right there pause right there oh oh you mean guys that
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:28.400]  play with a ball for a living wow guys that dribble a basketball and throw a ball around a
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:34.640]  yard i'm shocked that they aren't the most politically savvy people i mean wow i'm not insulting
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:39.760]  athletes plenty of them are very very brilliant people i'm just saying it's like oh my gosh these
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:44.880]  athletes you know they think this is about trump well no kidding they play with a ball all day long
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.760]  go back popovich the coach of the spurs steve kerr the coach of the golden state warriors
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.360]  pause right there i'm a hundred percent convinced that the only reason you're hearing these head
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:57.840]  coaches say this is so that they can still be friends and and cater to their athletes i don't
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.560]  know if they actually believe it go back from donald trump to either of them uh they happen to be
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:07.600]  white the people who he has responded to again obsessed over race holland cavernick jamelle hill
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:13.200]  from espn lavar these people are all anti-american this focusing there's nothing to do with race
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:17.920]  that's what they don't get grateful people in the sports world who are black and i just want to
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:23.120]  point out that this is a very old playbook in this country it dates back to jack johnson who
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:28.560]  was condemned by the u.s congress he was the first black heavyweight boxing champion and this idea
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:33.600]  that when you focus on black athletes that's what they're doing white resentment because there's
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:39.360]  anger about whether it's their salary their fame or this idea that you know they should be grateful
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:43.440]  for having these opportunities as if they haven't worked for them and pause it real quick yeah that's
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:49.120]  right uh that's right bud because i'm sure these basketball players could go make tens of millions
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.680]  of dollars in any other country no yeah i'm sure all of these football players could go make tens
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:37:00.400]  of millions in dollars in any other no no so the only place where they could actually do what they do
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:09.200]  and make money is america oh but america is the problem and it's a race issue and and they
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:15.680]  they should feel entitled to just get all the praise in the world uh why wouldn't you be grateful
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.440]  that you get three million people a year if you're an athlete and you're a baseball player you get
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.880]  three million people a year to come out and watch you yeah i would be grateful that i'm grateful
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.760]  for our audience and go back to this troll and you know a million people who would have the skill
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:34.000]  and ability to achieve that plateau and we can actually build upon the history of previous generations
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.440]  of activist athletes to understand not only how to keep pushing forward sports as a platform for
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:45.280]  social change but also keep pushing forward um the the very idea that you don't sign away you know
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.160]  you're positive change or to have a political opinion uh just to be organic as well as how
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:56.480]  it's not organic now it's all forced it's all force fed it's all based on lies you know it's
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:02.160]  all manipulated by soros and and linda cockroach sarsore i mean it's just such a joke now
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.680]  so he mentions in there he's like oh well this is obviously a racial thing because most players
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:18.480]  in the NFL are black most players in the NBA are black well then i'm sorry then as a white person
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:24.400]  i i think they have black privilege 90 of those leagues are black well must be black privilege
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:30.320]  no it's because they're better athletes we don't obsess over skin color here that's msnbc
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:39.040]  and again you know these let me just tell you something people don't know i came from
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:46.000]  from sports media now if you here's the thing and i'll actually give lavar ball a little credit
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.680]  for something even though he's he was very disrespectful and unappreciative of what president
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:56.320]  trump did i'll give him credit for something if you want to do something about one of the biggest
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:03.120]  crimes probably in the history of sports that is universities taking advantage of black students
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:08.720]  it's time to shut down the ncaa do you realize that the ncaa makes billions and billions of
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:14.800]  dollars every year and doesn't pay their athletes a dime do you realize that probably i don't know
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:21.360]  the number but i would say at least 80 percent of ncaa uh rosters for basketball are probably
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:29.440]  african-american males they don't get paid where's the outcry mark emerton the ncaa make billions
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:37.440]  of dollars hand over fist every year what do the athletes get nada zip zilch well where's the call
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.080]  for something to be done about that where's the racism there how about the ncaa you want to talk
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:49.680]  about being racist how racist is the ncaa basketball let me tell you something the reason why the ncaa
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:57.280]  is so dirty i mean you could you could read on for days about scandals in the ncaa made up classes
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:02.880]  kids faking classes kids getting cars kids getting payouts they can't even sell a a headband they
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:07.200]  wore during the game and that's illegal but the university is allowed to make millions of dollars
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:13.120]  off of their labor nothing on that though don't call out the ncaa for taking advantage of black
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:21.200]  people no it's only trump and then you had this story which doesn't surprise me nfl ratings down
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:27.200]  again over christmas weekend and now they're getting beat by the nba that's something that you
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:33.760]  never see but the one thing about the nba over christmas is the nba used to go like all out for
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.920]  christmas they'd wear christmas jerseys they'd all be in christmas colors it'd be a huge thing for
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.560]  christmas well for some reason this christmas the nba decided to just act like it wasn't about
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:47.920]  christmas so i don't know if there's anything to that but i'm just wondering when the msnbc sports
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:53.200]  editor is going to call out the ncaa for taking advantage of african-american athletes and fleecing
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.440]  them for billions of dollars i'm just curious if msnbc will ever do that let's squeeze in jason
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:01.760]  here before we go to a break jason in florida calling in go ahead jason
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:11.680]  we'll get jason i know he's there go ahead jason how are you guys doing today i'm doing all right
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.560]  i'm just wondering if msnbc is going to uh do something about the taking advantage the ncaa
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.520]  taking advantage of black black athletes i'm just curious if they're gonna say anything
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:26.080]  probably not because you know at the end of the day they get uh you know probably a hundred
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:31.440]  thousand dollars oh that's right oh that's right you're right the nbc affiliate the nbc major
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:38.720]  network profits off the ncaa good point but uh you know you you guys you know i got no problem
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:43.440]  with you guys you know i kind of i try to walk the middle of the line here uh i like stuff from
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:47.360]  the right and from the left you know i think that's kind of where we all need to migrate to is you
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:51.680]  know there's good stuff from both sides yeah just you know look at look at information and
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:57.680]  find out you know where your thoughts line what's real sure sure absolutely absolutely i agree with
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.800]  you a hundred percent but uh you know in my mind you guys are kind of doing the same thing that
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:07.200]  these other guys do you're out here bashing the next network you know you're promoting your agenda
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:11.040]  i'm not saying that you're right or wrong or they're right or wrong by any means but it's the same
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:16.320]  you know what i'm glad that you said that i'm glad that you said that jason i had a bunch of friends
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:21.280]  over christmas that were shocked they were like oh and you've become such an angry hateful person
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:26.400]  since you began working for info wars i'm like no i'm not i'm the same happy go lucky cheery guy i mean

[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:35.680]  but here's the difference jason because you're you're actually hitting something here i get mad
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:41.520]  when people attack the things that i love so when they want to abort children when they want to when
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:47.280]  they want to try to divide this country on lies yeah then i get a little mad so when msnbc is
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:52.480]  sitting here race baiting to try to incite a civil war yeah i get a little ticked off about that i

[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:56.480]  news historians now wrestling with how to teach lgbt history to school children as california
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:04.000]  becomes the first date to use lgbt left out like 74 different sexual variations sir with this story
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.040]  william racist fox and rick it's controversial because some publishers were not comfortable
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:14.000]  identifying people as gay they did not help themselves or the conclusion lacked evidence
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:28.560]  and said oh my gosh these people i just honestly for i i don't even know how to deal with these
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:35.840]  people anymore i don't know if there's any hope for them they are so obsessed with their agenda
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.000]  they are so obsessed with their identity politics that they're sitting here just looking at people
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.560]  like well maybe he was gay so let's say he was gay and put him in the history class maybe she was gay
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.840]  but well yeah okay let's say she was gay let's they're just now they are deciding what your sexual
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:49:00.400]  orientation is all right finish the clip parents cannot opt out oh my welcome to elementary school
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:06.320]  we're in california elementary school requires a fair accurate inclusive and respectful treatment
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.880]  of lesbian gay by entrance how many kids just pause it how many kids in elementary school think that
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:23.200]  they're gay now how many will go back to the clip i think what's going on here i is um um an effort
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:29.760]  to uh politicize history we're not what we're not saying there's an agenda we're not saying that
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.360]  these people are better than other people what we're saying is this is another group of americans
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:40.080]  and they face certain prejudices this state required publishers like mark jared to include
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:46.160]  the sexual preferences of prominent historical figures among others activists jane adams writers
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.680]  emily dickinson and nathaniel hawthorne and people are all dead james buccannon though evidence is
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:58.480]  inconclusive yeah we should say buccannon he never married he had a very good friend he's gay
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:03.200]  he may have been gay on the other hand he may have been gay so let's say he's gay what is this
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:08.880]  uh seen as something evil and wrong the state approved jared's text how many of these people
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:13.520]  do you think are closet homosexuals coach driver charlie parker's as a woman who i did
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:18.640]  his problem was driving this barren von stuben who helped washington at valley forge may have been
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:24.640]  gay point wall whitman was running young men in parks and dance halls but denied his same sex
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:31.840]  preferences in public much of this is speculation good line it's uh yeah must have though most of
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.880]  this is speculation so let's make sure that this is mandatory in elementary school i mean folks this
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:44.800]  is out of control lesbian astronaut sally ride yeah maybe he was gay how i mean seriously what are
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:51.760]  you how do you cover this how do you cover something so insane that there's not even a foundation
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:51:01.120]  there's not even a basis so we're going to be now in california forcing children in elementary
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:10.240]  school to take lgbtq wtf9 or history but think about it first of all i don't even think i don't
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:19.120]  even think black history is is uh is forced to be taught in elementary maybe it is maybe it isn't
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:26.800]  but imagine imagine if someone floated the notion out there that we should make it mandatory for
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:36.160]  children in high school to learn about white history shut it down shut it down racist racist
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:42.560]  how dare you all right but let's get the lgbt history month in there and let's plug a bunch of
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:53.360]  names in there well do you know they're gay no oh okay so i guess uh boy from the madness in california
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:59.760]  to the madness in new york bill de Blasio likens himself to thomas edison henry ford and mahatma
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:06.400]  ghandi and so now thomas edison henry ford and mahatma ghandi are spinning in their graves
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:10.320]  probably trying to rip they're probably trying to rip their way out of the coffin right now just
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.840]  to strangle de Blasio you know i don't know how de Blasio wins an election this guy is such a fop
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:24.400]  i mean i guess just you know they flood these inner cities with people that are on welfare
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:28.720]  tell them to vote the democrat so they can get their welfare they flood them with the immigrants
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:33.440]  they tell them keep voting democrat so we can keep chain migration going i think that's how
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:37.120]  they win of course we already know about the voter blocks they bring in with their open borders
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:44.000]  and immigration policy but de Blasio so now it basically de Blasio is getting attacked from the
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:50.400]  left and he says well you know all of these people that doubt me and my progressive policies need to
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:59.200]  look at all the struggles that thomas edison and henry ford and mahatma ghandi had oh oh i remember
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:05.600]  when mahatma ghandi had a uh had a staffer get arrested for for thousands and thousands of
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:10.240]  child pornography documents on his computer that oh no no that didn't happen to ghandi
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:14.960]  now that was de Blasio well i remember when thomas edison marched in the streets of new york
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:22.400]  with i think his name was oscar revera uh a terrorist a known terrorist arrested charged
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:27.280]  terrorist that was that was thomas edison that marched in the streets with the terrorist right
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:35.280]  oh no no no oh that was de Blasio too wait a second henry ford though henry ford was the
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:41.840]  mayor of new york city when there was like 10 terrorist attacks so that was henry oh no no
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:51.520]  no that that was de Blasio too wow and then he gets reelected yeah i mean what's crazier new
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:58.960]  york or california uh let's go to john who's calling in from california my goodness john
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:04.720]  uh be sure to sign up for your lgbtq class because it's mandatory now what's up john
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:11.040]  do we have john
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:21.520]  guys is john there or okay let's go to mckinsey in south carolina
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.960]  now you're you're actually called in about this subject talking about um
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:33.040]  disinfo from teachers propaganda it's actually shocking what teachers will do in these classes
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:38.480]  with their bias and then pretend that it's it's centered uh go ahead mckinsey
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:44.240]  yeah i'm a senior right now and i've been reading all about the whole senior let's
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:49.280]  clarify high school or college high school sorry yeah i'm reading about what i'm probably
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:53.600]  going to end up going in the head i'm a black person i'm a lot of people are racist i don't
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:57.920]  want that that takes me look bad i don't want to be associated with that people don't want to
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:01.920]  be associated with that's just like what do you do with your teacher teaches you one thing and the
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:08.320]  reality is a whole different thing all together well there was a kid in new york who had a teacher
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:14.880]  that basically did a whole lesson on white privilege and how black people are oppressed
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:20.800]  this individual happened to be uh of hispanic descent and the individual just stood up and was
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:27.360]  like uh excuse me no and then cited the numbers like look at the fbi statistics on crime look at
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:32.880]  the fbi statistics on police encounters with black and white people size statistics completely
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.200]  buries the white privilege or or the you know blacks are the only ones that have it bad with
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:41.760]  police and says look you know police incidents happen against all races all colors you know this
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:47.920]  isn't a racist thing and then what did the teacher do kicked him out of class what did the school do
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:54.640]  suspended him you can't make this stuff up you literally cannot deny the teacher what the teacher
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:56:00.160]  says they're also gonna get kicked out even if the teacher's lying to you they're gonna say the fbi
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:06.160]  state news next that's what they're gonna say i mean what are you saying as a high school senior
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:12.640]  i mean is it is it is it as bad at your school i mean i live in the deep south i mean my school
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:17.520]  i live just even the most liberal part in columbia it's not as bad as it would be in like california
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:22.080]  but it's still have you know teachers who like literal literal anti-fuzz reporters like we have
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:26.560]  a teacher publicans club and one of the teachers had her kid like hit one of the members with a
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:30.400]  paper balloon during a halloween party you know it's like go hit the republic and they're like
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:36.480]  what in the world is this well yeah and what do you expect i honestly i didn't experience this until
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:42.960]  i got into college but i didn't really realize it at the time but when you look back you realize it
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:47.360]  it what what is going to happen to these kids that go into college specifically white people but
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:54.320]  black people as well when you have a teacher a white teacher that is filled with so much white
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:57:02.000]  guilt she hates herself he hates himself so then they project that onto the rest of the class and
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.840]  the weak minded fall for it and so then you have all these white people that feel like they're
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:09.680]  privileged and they're and they've been oppressing black people so now they're crazy and then you
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.200]  have the black people that feel like oh it's the white man's fault and everything that happens is
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:17.280]  the white man's fault so then they never want to do something to succeed for themselves because
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:26.880]  they've been victimized so it's it's it's a 360 rotation here and it's literally all liberal
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:35.440]  indoctrination it's all the victim mindset it's all about i'm a victim i've got it bad so now you
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:39.760]  have to be a victim and then if we're all victims and we all have it bad well then we'll all just
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:43.200]  sit here and just play in our misery i mean misery loves company after all

[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:53.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:11.920]  you want answers well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:19.360]  trumps been any year and this is a fair time to average all the stuff he did
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:26.640]  as president elect with when he officially became president he's not god he can't get it all done
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:32.480]  i'm surprised how much he's gotten done it's been miraculous and they said he'd never get the tax
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:37.200]  cuts through on and on and on and they played all the race games you know there's new statistics out
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:43.520]  and it's not that hispanics that make up something like 70 percent of of uh immigrants come to the
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:50.560]  country are inherently criminal it's that there is a contingent already fleeing justice like americans
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:56.560]  flee to mexico and vice versa that don't have real names have fake ids that the mexican consulate
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:00.880]  will give them all these corrupt state governments and local governments will give them ids and they
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:05.600]  are just above the law and they mainly feed if you look at the statistics on other hispanics
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:10.160]  Mexico gets illegal aliens from latin america and gives them six months to your hard labor
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:15.120]  and tortures them that's the one in guardian and i'm not defending that the point is acting
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:19.520]  like america is the worst thing on earth is not true and then the democrats try to
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:26.160]  turn hispanics particularly into a new racial group and make it race-based politics and that's
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:33.200]  failing and that's good news for everybody so Jorge Ramos says he's now having the worst time
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:40.400]  of his life in the u.s with donald trump there i have never been treated so badly i've never been
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:47.520]  insulted so much we've never been attacked so much they've never tried to run us out as much as now
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:53.760]  ramos vented in an interview with the spanish radio network ramos who proclaimed himself
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:58.960]  is not the enemy but an opponent of trump in the interview complained about the massive blowback
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:04.960]  he's received since deciding to use his media platform to openly oppose the choice over 62
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:09.920]  million americans who voted last year's election then he complains about social networks the social
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:15.120]  networks are 10 to 1 against libertarians nationalists and conservatives but we know most of them
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:19.760]  are bots we know it's fake so we don't care if we get ridiculed we keep hammering back but
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:25.200]  everybody knows the democrats the globalists the liberals are way more threatening way more hateful
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:31.120]  constantly calling for violence and then when kate stanley gets shot in the back and the virtue
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:37.520]  signaling mainly white jury lets the guy who'd been deported what five times and committed all
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:46.320]  these crimes lets him go not even manslaughter not even accidental because they couldn't signal
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:52.000]  that it was wrong to shoot her in the back what about kate well signs were put up at the university
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:58.320]  there in san francisco and folks pulled them down and said this is racist all it said was she had
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:04.640]  dreams too like she's a human too she has rights too but then nancy polosi virtue signals and says
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:11.600]  illegal migrants embody the best of our nation not migrants not not not people coming here to work
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:18.160]  not people coming here to be americans but migrants which means illegals and then she goes on to say
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:23.120]  they embody the best of our nation's patriotism hard work persevering polosi said the dreamers
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:28.240]  she added that congress shouldn't leave them to celebrate the holidays and fear oh really what
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:36.080]  about kate stanley meanwhile so it was terrorism attacker who rammed his car into victims upset at
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:42.000]  mistreatment of muslims and of course you've had hundreds of these attacks the last few years in
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:47.280]  russia europe here all over and most of the time they'll never even say it's his lamasist in fact
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:52.160]  in sweden and in other areas they won't release the name they've passed laws and regulations
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:59.040]  saying it's racist if the guy's name is habip or hamam and or op-med or whatever it's just incredible
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:05.520]  so we had a call or call in earlier and and the caller made a fair point like you know in in some
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:10.880]  instances i feel like maybe you kind of do the same thing that the mainstream media does attacking
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:17.600]  your opponents but what am i supposed to do see when horre ramos what i mean what an absolute
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:25.440]  lying fraud horre ramos is to sit here and be like oh i've got it so bad now because bullcrap
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:30.480]  you're still making millions of dollars you but but what does he do he says it's been harder for us
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:36.720]  because of trump now it's been harder for us he's virtue signaling to hispanic and latino people like
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:46.000]  trump hates you america hates you now because of trump that is an absolute lie so yes i get mad
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:52.320]  when horre ramos consciously lies to people to try to tear this country down yeah i get a little
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:59.280]  pissed feel your body with carnivore the new digestive enzyme product by info war's life

[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:13.200]  discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut digestive

[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:18.720]  so james wesley-rawls joins me now survivalblog.com uh james let's start with some financial stuff
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:25.600]  bitcoin peaked right at about 20 000 it goes back down uh gold was going down the entire time now
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:31.360]  gold is backed up what do you see as a smart investment right now for someone looking to
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:36.720]  invest do you think precious metals do you think bitcoin what do you think well i'm definitely
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:43.600]  an advocate of precious metals and in particular silver and for anyone who's considering gold
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:50.080]  i'm actually leaning more toward platinum right now presently gold is around what 1275 an ounce
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:59.360]  platinum is down to 940 an ounce and traditionally platinum has sold at a premium above the price
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:06.480]  of gold now it's selling at a discount to gold so logic dictates that if it's going to return to
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:12.640]  its historic norms which i think it will that the wise place to put your money is platinum not gold
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:18.720]  interesting yeah so so that's a safe investment you think because the way platinum normally goes
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:25.040]  it would be a safe investment right now absolutely uh and but in general though i'm more of a
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:31.120]  proponent of silver than i am either gold or any of the metals in the platinum group and
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:40.160]  the reason being i'm a prepper and i'm geared toward uh barter in a financial wipeout situation
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:46.640]  and there silver would be much much much more practical for barter than gold gold is simply
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:51.840]  too compact a form of wealth for practical barter i guess you could do it with a cold chisel
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:56.640]  that it's not very pretty it's better to have silver small silver coins that are much more
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:03.040]  practical for day-to-day purchases now shifting to bitcoin obviously it saw a huge boom and it's
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:09.280]  kind of come back down to earth you know the only thing that's kind of confusing to me about bitcoin
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:16.320]  is how practical really is it right now and how practical would it be say a situation breaks
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:22.160]  out where you have to go into survival mode well it wouldn't be practical at all in survival mode
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.760]  because if you don't have access to the internet you don't have access to bitcoin but uh there
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:34.000]  is some utility in bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies and i i think that it is
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:42.080]  wise for people to at least take a small hedge position into the cryptos and uh but people
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:50.880]  just have to do that with both eyes open not get emotional about it and be ready to sell or buy
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:57.760]  at the drop of a hat now watch the markets closely it's definitely not a market for someone
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:04.560]  who is faint of heart because we're going to see some huge swings in bitcoin but i think that in
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:10.640]  another couple of years we may see bitcoin over $50,000 what about other cryptocurrencies out there
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:15.200]  why is bitcoin seen to be the one that's taking off the most what do you have any faith in any
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:21.040]  other cryptocurrencies i think ethereum is quite good and salt for example there's a lot of good
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:28.960]  ones out there they all use the same essentially the same bitcoin blockchain technology and they
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:35.680]  all have comparable levels of security bitcoin is the most popular simply because it was there
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:41.920]  first it doesn't have any real technological superiority to any of the others and of course
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:48.240]  there's no intrinsic value in any of them so they're all highly speculative but they do
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:54.320]  make a good little hedge and um i think the thing to do is to watch the market very carefully
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:00.480]  take a small position in either bitcoin or ethereum watch them very carefully
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:09.040]  and then watch for news about the other cryptocurrencies and then on a day when
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:16.160]  either bitcoin or ethereum are quite high you can shift some of your holdings from bitcoin
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:23.920]  to one of the lesser known cryptos immediately following news of a minor panic within that
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:31.040]  crypto say for example there's news that the you know the ceo of whatever cryptocurrency
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:38.320]  corporation has been indicted or that someone or the ceo has committed suicide or or that
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:45.200]  and shockingly that type of news comes down the pipeline about once a month actually yeah it does
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:52.160]  so just watch very carefully and as bitcoin stair steps upward be ready to diversify out
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:59.360]  into the other cryptos but do it on a day when bitcoin is high and the and the currency the
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:06.160]  crypto that you want to move it into is relatively low especially following bad news and with some
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:13.280]  of the other cryptos the swings in in market valuation for those coins are even wider than
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:21.440]  with bitcoin so you can take advantage of some short-term bad news say for example the securities
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:27.920]  and exchange commission or the IRS says they're going to crack down on whatever currency that
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:36.240]  that crypto might plummet 50 60 70 percent in one day that's the day to buy in and diversify
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:42.640]  out of bitcoin in the long-term your portfolio cryptos should be spread over at least three
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:49.680]  crypto currencies preferably four or five and as a long-term hedge I think that's the safe place
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:55.920]  to be it used to be you would only hear about cryptocurrencies or bitcoin on alternative news
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:00.720]  you know here at info wars yourself or Gerald Salente or other people's you know blogs and
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:06.400]  stuff talking about bitcoin but now for the first time I've ever seen I mean a day doesn't go by
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:10.560]  where some mainstream news network isn't talking about bitcoin should you buy should you sell
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:15.360]  what type of impact do you think now that it's entered the fold of mainstream news what type
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:20.560]  of impact do you think that has on bitcoin I think it's going to make things even more volatile
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:28.720]  and in the long term though the number of people in the world who have access to a smart phone
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:34.320]  versus the number who have taken a hedge position in bitcoin is minuscule so I think in the long
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:42.560]  term the cryptos are going to do fairly well but there's a number of factors that could make any of
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:49.040]  them completely wiped out overnight all right that's James Wesley Rawls survival blog dot com
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:55.680]  we talked some bitcoin in the next segment we're gonna talk some geopolitics heart disease is on

[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:37.520]  we're about to discuss some geopolitics but first he wanted to finish a couple key points on bitcoin
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:43.840]  go ahead james the floor is yours thanks oh and i just wanted to stress that there's a lot of risks
[02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:49.840]  with any of the bitcoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies you know we're in a situation
[02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:55.840]  where there's a kind of a rising tide of interest in the cryptos and the old saying in the financial
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:21:03.040]  markets is a rising tide lifts all ships and that will i think be true of the cryptocurrencies
[02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:09.680]  but just keep in mind that there's a lot of risk there never have more than five or ten percent
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:15.760]  of of your net worth in cryptos and that's even someone who's watches the market very closely
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:20.640]  for anyone else i wouldn't suggest more than one or two percent of their net worth and keep
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:28.560]  in mind that we live in a society that's driven by envy and as the cryptocurrencies take off
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:35.120]  as i think they will in the next couple of years i think we're going to see a lot of hacker interest
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:41.360]  in the cryptos because these are going to be people who feel like they they missed out
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:46.400]  and they're going to be envious and they're going to want to steal from others
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:50.880]  and they're mainly i think going to go after the the crypto exchanges rather than currencies
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:58.880]  themselves but i think there will also be concerted attacks on individual accounts
[02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:07.200]  in attempts to recover passwords so people should be very very careful about the passwords they use
[02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:12.160]  or past phrases they use and where they keep those past phrases it's also very important
[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:20.000]  to keep redundant copies of your bitcoin wallet but keep very close track of where those are physically
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:27.760]  and ideally your laptop that you use for trading bitcoin should be a spare laptop that you only
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:33.680]  connect to the internet very infrequently just for bitcoin trading otherwise that machine
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:39.840]  that device is kept offline to minimize the vulnerability to hackers
[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:48.400]  and go ahead no i was just going to say so that's the expert's take on bitcoin and make sure if
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:55.280]  you're going to invest you do it wisely as to not put yourself in a hole should anything bad happen
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:23:00.560]  James i want to move into some geopolitics now you know there's so much there's so much craziness
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:06.480]  going on you've got north japanese newspapers reporting north korea kim jong-un is trying
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:12.880]  to put anthrax on a warhead you've got this story came out of fox there's a war coming
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:19.440]  marine corps general warns us troops you've got russia accusing the united states of training
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:25.680]  former ices fighters in syria to me that has john mccain's earmarks all over it he he he admitted
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:31.680]  to doing that and then you have the u.s coalition saying less than a thousand ices fighters left
[02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:37.440]  in iraq and syria so there seems to be positive movements but then there also seems to be
[02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:45.120]  negative movements in the geopolitics of course you have israel and palestine fighting after
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:49.280]  trump said jerusalem was a capital just like they were before trump said that but somehow it's
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:54.800]  trumps fault but but i'm just curious with with all of the developments in specifically syria
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:24:01.520]  and then russia united states and ukraine where do you see this going right now because you know
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:05.520]  if you think that russia and the united states are colluding well then why is the united states
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:12.000]  arming ukraine and why would the united states or members of the deep state here be trying to get
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:20.400]  ices fighters back a foothold in syria yeah i i do think that syria is really the wild card out
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:28.320]  there even more so than north korea there is a huge risk of syria the syrian civil war spinning
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:35.680]  out of control and becoming a regional war or even a world war and the reason being is that
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:45.040]  everyone's attention up till now has primarily been upon ices and the ices surrogates now that ices
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:51.840]  is largely out of the picture i think that the syrian regime is going to focus its attention
[02:24:51.840 --> 02:25:01.280]  on other dissidents inside of syria including the Kurds and once they start committing themselves
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:09.440]  in the Kurdistan region i think there's huge potential for this to get out of control and
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:20.240]  whether it involves you know russian and american aircraft for example or or incursions into into
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:28.240]  into turkey into iraq there could be all sorts of things that spin out of control here that are
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:35.280]  very difficult to predict and the ramifications of those could be enormous yeah i tend to agree
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:40.480]  with you where i think the the real wild card here is syria and not necessarily north korea i mean
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:47.360]  to me it's kind of widely known north korea is a cancer communism has failed there now what
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:51.280]  relationship china has with north korea and how china uses north korea that's a totally different
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:56.640]  story but you know you take care of north korea i don't know how much of a blowback you necessarily
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:02.080]  get but you start trying to intervene in syria now russian is going to be pissed now russia is
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:06.720]  going to try to ally ally with china and then of course you've got the oil pipeline that they're
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:10.560]  trying to get through there too so that'll just tick off the world even more united states oil wars
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:16.000]  but what is the positive i mean syria is more independent now than they've ever been christians
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.720]  are allowed to celebrate christmas and walk around the streets and praise jesus without
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:26.160]  getting slaughtered by isis now i mean who is it that try who i mean honestly is it the deep
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:30.160]  state is the united states doing something again that we didn't want them to do expanding war in
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:35.680]  syria under the covers but but i mean who is this that is trying to stop syria from being independent
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:42.720]  well yeah it's one of those qui bono kind of questions and it's really it's difficult to say
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:51.840]  what the who the real players really are and what the long-term strategy is but even in the short
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:27:02.880]  term there's there's tremendous risk and a lot of unpredictability so it's wise for folks to plan on
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:10.640]  a possibly a regional war developing in the middle east and planning accordingly i think that we
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:15.120]  could if that were to happen we would see gas prices spike up over four dollars a gallon
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:21.280]  so from a practical standpoint as a prepper my advice is if you live in the country and by
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:27.440]  code you can legally install a fuel storage tank put in a big diesel tank and if you if you use
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:33.200]  propane to heat your home replace that tank with a much larger tank perhaps a two or even three
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:41.920]  thousand gallon tank because the price swings in the liquid fuels could be huge that's the practical
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:50.240]  side of it on the political side of it it's uh it's very funny that uh that the liberal mass media
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:57.120]  is still trying to point finger fingers at the trump administration and claim collusion with
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:04.320]  the russians where whereas uh as the Mueller investigation goes on there's more and more
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:10.240]  evidence that the real collusion actually was between the clinton's and russia yeah i mean
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:14.240]  that's been totally blown out of the water you can't put that genie back in the bottle but but real
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:21.200]  quick final 30 seconds here it is kim is kim jung-un really crazy enough to try to put anthrax on
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:25.600]  the head of a warhead or is that just the japanese press kind of freaking out right now now i think
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:31.040]  that may be more posturing than anything else what i'm really worried about is not kim jung-un's
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:36.880]  nuclear delivery means by missile but rather him simply putting a traditional fishing bomb inside
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:41.680]  a connex and delivering it to a major seaport like long beach harbor oh yeah i mean let's not forget
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:46.400]  under obama we had open borders for eight years who knows who could have snuck in a sneak a suitcase

[02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:18.560]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex
[02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:30.160]  jones well it doesn't matter that the united states is in a way squaring off with russia
[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:37.520]  right now funding ukraine and then perhaps you have the stories about new isis fighters or or
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:43.600]  similar type fighters in syria with us backing should ask john mccain about that he brags about it
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:51.600]  yet the russian probe is ongoing and while nothing has actually landed on trump
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:59.200]  the left continues to obsess over mewler and manifold as this story robert mewler may indict
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:10.160]  paul manifold again okay well a lot of openness about that headline to say the least but again
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:17.440]  the cat is already out of the bag and they can't put it back in mewler probe outgrows its witch hunt
[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:24.800]  phase well it was never just a witch hunt it was a get rid of trump hunt that was the whole purpose
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:30.400]  take trump down and by the way betsey woodruff you know she's actually not one of the worst she
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:35.120]  goes on msnbc every once while writes for the daily beast she's kind of level headed but she buys the
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:39.440]  whole russian inclusion thing so i kind of feel bad for because that's why she kind of uh writes
[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:46.160]  these stories then the daily mail says trump tears into garbage golden showers dossier
[02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:55.840]  don't just don't not do not forget about this i'm telling you donald trump is still ticked off
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:02.640]  about this fake dossier and while every cat and all the genies are getting let out of the bottle
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:11.120]  from mewler's end of things with rozenstein with peter stroke with bruce or and nelly or i mean we
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:17.280]  found it i'm telling you it's good that you can't put the genie back in the bottle this was a story
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:23.520]  from world net daily did the fbi conspire to stop trump and now they put it as a question uh here
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:27.360]  give me give me the dot cam guys i'm gonna fix this headline for them actually we're gonna go ahead
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:34.000]  and just cross did out and then cross the question mark out all right new headline the fbi conspired
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:44.000]  to stop trump that's not a conspiracy theory that is a conspiracy fact i mean do i really have to
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:49.760]  sit here and break this down again it's like peter stroke and james comey let hillary clinton off
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:57.200]  for her crimes then you have peter stroke saying just in case trump wins we need to have an insurance
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:04.080]  plan well what is he saying he's saying they think they're bigger than the election he's
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:10.480]  saying in case trump wins we have to get him out of office and in the meantime we're gonna spy on
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:16.080]  trump and his team to look for dirt we're gonna make up a fake dossier so that we can spy on them
[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:23.040]  then using that we're gonna say he was colluding with russia to try to delegitimize his presidency
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:34.000]  and where did all of that nonsense originate the fbi obama's doj and hillary clinton herself
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:43.280]  so it's not did the fbi conspire to stop trump it's we already know we have it the fbi conspired
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:48.640]  to stop trump we already know hillary clinton rigged the democrat primary so she could beat
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:54.160]  bernie sanders you don't think she tried to rig the election too of course she did this is one of
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:59.120]  the most wanton criminals in the history of the world hillary clinton and she has so much dirt
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:04.160]  in her closet and all of her cronies are so deep and deeply embedded in criminal behavior
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:10.080]  they had to get her in so that they don't end up going to jail because that's where they're all
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:17.120]  gonna end up that's where they're all gonna end up and the cats are to the back out of the bag we
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:23.360]  have the names we know what they did we know how comey and stroke worked together to get hillary off
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:31.920]  we then know how hillary funded the the fake dossier that got moved about we now know how the
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:39.360]  doj with bruce or was communicating with obama this entire time and that nelly or was communicating
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:49.040]  with god knows who over a ham radio peter stroke says we have to have an insurance policy so now
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:54.880]  you're seeing more of this g.o.p representative calls for purge of deep state cronies within the
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:38:03.120]  fbi well again i'm fully expecting this to happen before long but it's pretty easy you you sit down
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:08.000]  peter stroke for a hearing a testimony you do it in public you grill him and you make him sing like
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:15.200]  a bird and then if he doesn't sing and he doesn't want to cooperate well you've got a whole investigation
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:20.640]  going into trump colluding with russia where there's nothing i think at that time you open up an
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:26.560]  investigation into peter stroke and how he was colluding to having quote unquote insurance policy
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:33.680]  in case trump won there's your investigation can't wait for that to happen and i get the feeling
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:39.200]  it's uh it's gonna happen all right let's go back out to the phone lines let's start with matthew
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:47.520]  calling in from mrs sippy go ahead matthew hey oh and how you doing buddy good i got a couple things
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:53.920]  i'll appreciate you taking my call you i've talked to you a couple times the deep state is in panic
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:59.040]  mode i want to go over a couple things are you familiar with the gentleman by the name of codie
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:08.000]  stodgers the xcia blackoff operator that's come on the common sense show he went on the rent show
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:14.400]  youtube channels of course he was just on the another youtube channel the other day
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:22.000]  he is exposed to deep state like no other actually the event that happened at cuba
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:33.920]  is now happening in the united states donald rumpfield uh is now being looked at with the
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:42.640]  911 event so it's not just on the left buddy you're gonna have deep state names being exposed
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:50.720]  when these indictments surface and they're even talking now about election fraud
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:58.880]  with the hillary clinton debacle in the q post well here's what it comes down to here's what it comes
[02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:07.200]  down to they can indict and arrest hillary and peter stroke probably or probably even obama
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:11.440]  they could arrest all of them right now they already have the evidence they already know
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:16.320]  what they did they could arrest all of them right now why aren't they doing it that's a different
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:23.760]  question go ahead i got one more thing and i know you got other collars this is if you go on my youtube
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:30.320]  channel which is truth not fiction matters i just did an interview with the bill pierce
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:37.440]  with the america first media group they are currently looking into the seth rich murder
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:43.120]  okay i really want you to watch that video oh and then email me and give me your opinion
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:51.120]  but the deep state is in deep trouble believe me and that gentleman that's called in and talked to
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:58.000]  mr alex jones i'd really like to talk to him that guy is dead on mr zack that's in morocco
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:04.240]  and i really think you guys need to get cody snodgrass now he was just involved everybody
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:10.640]  should know this he was just involved involved in a head-on collision and there's a bunch of
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:15.920]  information coming out that it was an intentional trying to take this gentleman out and that you
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:19.840]  know that's a key thing too because you know we talk about the deep state and we know what
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:25.200]  that is that's people embedded inside the government in very high-powered positions
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:30.640]  in certain bureaucracies where they're either blackmailed or they're working together with
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:37.520]  some sort of criminal conspiracy but we we sometimes forget that there's actually good people
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:40.880]  that are in these bureaucracies too there's actually good people that are in the fbi and
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:49.520]  the doj that don't want to see this happen that are calling it out and again we the cat is already
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:54.320]  out of the bag they're still looking up every corner for some russian collusion that never
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:59.360]  existed we literally have the entire story about how hillary clinton tried to steal the
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:03.040]  election from bernie sanders and how hillary clinton tried to steal the election from donald
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:09.840]  trump we got the whole thing we got the emails we got the text messages we got even they write
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:17.040]  books about seth rich you know so we already know it so what so you have to ask yourself
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.800]  what are they waiting for what is sessions waiting for what is president trump waiting for
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:26.480]  are they waiting for something do they think they can hook something else with a little bit of bait
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:34.320]  do they think they can get a bigger fish because again we already know bruce or nancy or peter
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:41.760]  stroke james combi barack obama hillary clinton we know what y'all did you couldn't let trump get
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:47.360]  in because hillary clinton was the final hammer to put the nails in the coffin of america and
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:55.760]  then trump got in and he's pried the coffin open we're climbing out we're back you deserve a deep

[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show oh and shroyer filling in today knock out some news here
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:44.560]  and then i'll take a couple more calls this is from the new york times paul krugman writes america
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:51.760]  is not yet lost now the funny thing is this story would have made sense a year ago but paul krugman
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:59.280]  decides to write it a year too late and says many of us came into 2017 expecting the worst and in many
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:06.800]  ways the worst is what we got he's right you know it was the worst stock market ever it was the worst
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:14.000]  unemployment numbers ever it was the worst for people uh going on welfare it was the worst for
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:22.240]  the housing market it was the worst for christmas sales it was the worst for tax cuts wait wait a
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:31.200]  second it was the best for all those things huh funny but isn't it amazing the new york times
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:40.240]  publishes a story that is the polar opposite of reality so you're right america is not yet lost
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:47.440]  you should have written this december 25th 2016 after obama tried to kill america and now in 2017
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:53.440]  trump has actually made the best things and then paul krugman says it's actually the worst
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:49:01.040]  so that's just you know a little illustration of a liberal mind or the new york times that
[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:06.000]  doesn't want you to even have a clue i mean they want you so stupid that you're so confused when
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:10.640]  you may wake up in the morning that you take anything they tell you as fact uh you know this
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:15.920]  was just an interesting story that caught my attention 2017 a year of disaster there actually
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:22.560]  were a lot of floods a lot of hurricanes and apparently a record number of damages so
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:32.560]  is that a sign of you know climate change or is that a sign of something else perhaps
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:41.520]  a non-human element u.s police remove white nationalist memorial from four shot australian
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:48.720]  women so see this is what they do now this is what they did to kate steinle where if you're white
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:57.440]  you're just a white nationalist if you're white you can't have a memorial you can't have a march
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:06.880]  because you're a white nationalist why can't someone just be a person so they do it in america
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:13.680]  kate steinle's march antiva shows up protests with guns they have a memorial in california
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:18.080]  the authorities remove the memorial and then they protest their memorial and then they throw away
[02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:25.280]  pictures of kate steinle now compare that to what you get for mike brown or trevon martin
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:35.040]  and there's the rift right there and why does that rift exist because that's what cnn and msnbc
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:42.880]  and barack obama want they want the rift so that they can divide and then demonize all i mean anyone
[02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:46.400]  who just thinks for themselves it doesn't matter if you're black or white or asian or hispanic if
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:51.360]  you think for yourself in fact now if you think for yourself you're a bigot and a white nationalist
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:56.800]  even if you're black seriously you think i'm making that up look at what black conservatives say
[02:50:56.800 --> 02:51:00.400]  and then look at what liberals say they say that they're white nationalists now so black
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:05.360]  people are now white nationalists according to liberals uh yeah just like uh new york time says
[02:51:05.360 --> 02:51:13.200]  2017 was the worst even though it was the best e you planning on olympic team to weaken national
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:19.360]  pride well you're not a country e you so i'm not sure how that's going to happen but the olympics
[02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:23.600]  you know they'll probably cater to that liberal ideology now i found this a little bit ironic
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:28.800]  and i'm gonna go to your phone calls we already knew this was going on but the story is back in the
[02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:36.640]  news apple faces lawsuits after saying it slows down aging iphones so just any end user could have
[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:40.480]  already told you that that was going on it was always a theory now they've admitted it but this
[02:51:40.480 --> 02:51:50.000]  is so funny the liberal a modern day liberal will protest anything and everything but oh especially
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:54.560]  if it's a big corporation i mean did you see the tax cuts the big corporations are getting
[02:51:54.560 --> 02:52:00.320]  oh how dare they the big corporations are the bad guy they're trying to screw us over and then
[02:52:00.960 --> 02:52:07.360]  here's a story of the big guy apple literally screwing over its users where's the liberal outrage
[02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:15.600]  where are the protests totally silent you know why because cnn and msnbc and barack obama aren't
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:22.400]  virtue signaling them into protesting but soon they'll probably virtue signal them in protesting
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:27.280]  like another women's march or something so an actual example of the big business that liberals
[02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:35.120]  hate screwing over the end user silence a fake news story about a woman that groped someone or
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:41.440]  got groped 40 years ago millions of people march that's how the brainwashing works that's how the
[02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:50.240]  fake news media works and that's how congruently a class of people is totally dilapidated mentally
[02:52:50.800 --> 02:52:57.440]  goes out into the streets to march for a cause that doesn't even exist and you say hey what are you
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:53:06.640]  out here uh screw you nazi oh very intellectual let's go to rick calling in from minnesota
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:16.080]  go ahead rick you're on the air how's it going it's going good um you're kind of talking about
[02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:20.480]  a subject i'm near and dear to my heart uh especially over the holidays kind of brother in
[02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:26.000]  lost season or in my case brother season um where you just kind of battle or or more
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:30.560]  else just keep your mouth shut because it's just idiotic yeah yeah they love they're so loving
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:35.200]  and open-minded that you need to shut your mouth because you have a different opinion yeah yeah and
[02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:40.960]  he's straight from the heart of it he's san diego so you know he knows all but uh one of the things
[02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:46.400]  that i find when i do actually engage people whether it be facebook or whatever is is they're
[02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:52.400]  talking about uh they don't want to believe any of the any truth that exists out there and they'll
[02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:56.560]  believe anything that they hear like you're just saying they're brainwashed um and i'm always looking
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:01.280]  for examples where i can uh kind of put it in their face and have them just dump on it their
[02:54:01.280 --> 02:54:06.640]  mouth drops open one of the things i saw recently um and i made a comment about and you might have
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:12.880]  covered this and if you have i'm sorry for repeating it but um it had to do with obama care
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:19.360]  and how uh trump being in office i think he's just going to inadvertently cause a lot of good
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:24.880]  things to happen and in this case well he intentionally he intentionally cut the mandate
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:28.960]  now so if you don't get obama care you don't have to pay the penalty so that's going to open up an
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:36.080]  entirely new marketplace exactly i mean anybody has any common sense can see it but uh liberal
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:43.360]  brainwashing it's magical but uh so he's you know in his in his uh other wisdom or are accidental
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:50.480]  because i'm not sure he's a big fan of uh obama care um but uh in just handling it like a business
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:56.160]  man he managed to get it done in half the time and the advertising was see but that's see that's
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:55:00.880]  exactly it though you just hit it on the head where we don't even need to like pontificate on
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:07.200]  on issues you just hit on the head trump is a successful businessman and he looks at how he
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:14.320]  became a success and he says the free market and capitalism so he says i want to instill that
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:20.000]  in america because that was successful to me and that's what made america successful and you look
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:23.440]  at the other side of the coin you look at obama well what has obama done in the private sector
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:29.840]  next to nothing he's a nothing he's a nothing he's a community organizer so trump private sector
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:37.920]  businessman massively successful by his own efforts says i want this to be for america obama
[02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:43.840]  a nothing accomplishes nothing works for the government a complete flop says well i never
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:48.800]  did anything to earn any money via my by my own efforts so so that's how i want america to be
[02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:52.880]  i want everybody to do nothing and then just have the government give them money so i mean
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:57.680]  that's what i'm saying though which one works which one doesn't the same one that's worked
[02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:03.840]  throughout human history capitalism shocking oh my gosh capitalism beats socialism every time
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:09.200]  i wish someone would have like had a history book or something on communism it's crazy
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:14.720]  yeah you covered so many different subjects i was like god where do i start because that's
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:18.960]  the one i wanted to talk about but it's like you went education and you went all over the place
[02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:23.840]  and you're talking about taxes and how you know what on your ramp about how um all these states with
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:29.360]  huge uh state taxes get to write it off and we all get to foot the bill and i i kind of came up
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:34.800]  with a panacea too i think we could solve a lot of the problems but you got other colors and so
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:40.160]  well yeah thank you so much for the call rick in minnesota i mean again i just don't understand
[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:46.080]  i mean if you're the one getting destroyed financially by state taxes and you're the
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:52.720]  one that hasn't been paying your fair share why is that my fault i had to pay my full state taxes
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:58.160]  you you didn't so i mean that's ridiculous steve you got 30 seconds uh close out this hour go ahead
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:05.280]  steve uh i just want to say about you and the holidays and they've seen you was angry and all
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:12.080]  that uh i think of watching your platform for years you're an alex and the work that you all
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:16.560]  have done and pointing out to evil with the petafires and the deep state and everybody just
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:23.760]  want to destroy the faith in god and the family the nation and the world just take a big deep
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:30.560]  breath when you get angry and upset because once you get there i think god's going to be very pleased
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:35.680]  with the battle that you all raised well and i'll tell you what steve hits it right on the head there
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:42.160]  i mean aside from the politics god is back in america president trump has invoked jesus christ

[03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:45.360]  your mind as we come back from christmas vacation well what a great great christmas it was oan and
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:52.560]  my very best christmas wishes for you will find the entire info or crew um president certainly
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:01:01.280]  ended up on an extraordinary high at the end of this holiday season the tax cut uh combined with the
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:08.480]  the systematic exposure of the partisan nature of the witch hunt against him by
[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:16.560]  robert muller i think has left the president an extraordinarily strong position uh shockingly i saw
[03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:25.040]  a piece on the hill today from my old watergate nemesis carl burnstein and carl burnstein says no
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:31.520]  no it's not the fbi that's corrupt it's donald trump that is corrupt now this is of course the
[03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:38.880]  same carl burnstein who as part of the woodward burnstein uh duo at the washington post ignored
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:46.960]  his partner's uh naval intelligence background ignored his partners uh deep ties to uh the
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:54.800]  white house chief of staff general al haig who very much like general uh michael kelly uh is
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:02:03.360]  sleepwalking the 37th president to uh the uh who sleepwalk the 37th president towards the gallows
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:10.560]  uh sam carl burnstein who of course ignored the fact that we now know and he knew then
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:18.320]  that the watergate special prosecutors were communicating with judge john sarika in the
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:26.240]  watergate trial uh which was uh both illegally inappropriate and would have tainted that trial
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:33.360]  had we known that at the time and known that the trial of the watergate burglars and their appeal
[03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:39.600]  was fixed in advance well there would have been no watergate there would have been no nixon
[03:02:39.600 --> 03:02:46.400]  resignation but today carl burnstein ignores the extraordinary evidence that we saw last week
[03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:55.600]  owen the tweets the emails the campaign contributions from muller's uh quizlings uh to hillary clinton
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:03:02.800]  and barack obama the text messages quite extraordinary burnstein was blind then he
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:08.240]  appears to be blind today wait a second roger wait a second roger the story says guys pull the
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:11.840]  story back up on the hill because i need to make sure that i i have this headline correct the
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:19.440]  headline is carl burnstein fbi isn't tainted trump's presidency is i mean roger it was obviously
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:25.200]  trump that covered up the jfk assassination so it's obviously trump that's tainted trump was the
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:30.000]  one that covered up the truth about the jfk assassination that was trump oh wait a second
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:35.360]  that was the fbi and trump released those documents oh i'm sorry carl burnstein you're just another
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:43.760]  libtard well this is extraordinary the fbi uh financed and promulgated the phony uh trump dossier
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:53.040]  which was used incredibly as the rationale for uh the fisa court warrants that authorized the
[03:03:53.040 --> 03:04:00.480]  surveillance of donald j trump and his campaign apparatus this uh makes watergate pale in comparison
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:07.920]  using the state apparatus using the taxpayer financed surveillance capabilities of the u.s
[03:04:07.920 --> 03:04:14.160]  government to spy on one's political opponents um well that's what watergate was supposedly
[03:04:14.160 --> 03:04:20.400]  all about but at least the nixon operation used it uh misguided outside forces in this
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:27.440]  case we have perverted the government for an illegal operation you're on the alex joneshaw i'm with
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:51.360]  my colleague oh and shoyer and we will be right back
[03:04:51.360 --> 03:04:58.080]  i can arizona you're on the air worldwide go ahead oh alex you can rent any day of the week
[03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:02.880]  thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save america
[03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:09.280]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well um and as a
[03:05:09.280 --> 03:05:15.520]  longtime info wars listener i want to say thanks for the awesome brain force anthro plex my girlfriend
[03:05:15.520 --> 03:05:20.000]  would like to say thanks for the anthro plex thank you um i use the bio true selenium the super
[03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:25.040]  blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans the super blue is awesome
[03:05:25.040 --> 03:05:30.480]  and thank you so much alex for the info wars life products they are quality i can't wait to get some
[03:05:30.480 --> 03:05:35.840]  more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy absolutely we because then we
[03:05:35.840 --> 03:05:41.760]  could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a
[03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:46.400]  bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and
[03:05:46.400 --> 03:06:02.320]  ourselves we can take our country back
[03:06:10.400 --> 03:06:14.400]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:20.800]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[03:06:25.120 --> 03:06:34.640]  it's simply incredible to me that people will publish stories that are 100 percent wrong and
[03:06:34.640 --> 03:06:40.880]  not just the stories they publish being wrong the truth is the exact opposite of what they're saying
[03:06:40.880 --> 03:06:45.600]  i mean this has always been the way with cnn and msnbc if they say one thing on that those channels
[03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:50.160]  you just assume the opposite is true but it's just like this paul krugman new york time says
[03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:56.240]  2017 was the worst for america even though it was like the best carl bursting says
[03:06:56.240 --> 03:07:02.080]  trump is tainted not the fbi it was the fbi that covered up the assassination of of jfk
[03:07:02.080 --> 03:07:08.480]  president trump was the one that released the documents so these people present to you news
[03:07:08.480 --> 03:07:18.800]  and stories that is not just completely inaccurate it is in fact the exact opposite of the truth so
[03:07:18.800 --> 03:07:26.640]  here is the lim tarred carl burnstein saying trump is tainted not the fbi even though we have
[03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:32.800]  all the evidence to the contrary everybody else is the issue here not donald trump and his actions
[03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:39.360]  are those around around him the key word in all of this that he keeps using is tainted there's only
[03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:44.800]  one institution that really has been tainted through these months and that is the trump presidency
[03:07:44.800 --> 03:07:50.640]  it's tainted by the president's lives by his disrespect for american institutions operating
[03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:56.400]  under the law with traditional american democracy and the instruments thereof
[03:07:56.400 --> 03:08:01.840]  he's contemptuous of those instruments and what we're seeing in these constant attacks
[03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:07.440]  which are undermining indeed confidence in the legitimate uh institutions of our government
[03:08:07.440 --> 03:08:13.440]  which are trying to do their job uh if the president is talking about his investigation
[03:08:14.160 --> 03:08:19.280]  is going to end very soon and with him being exonerated he ought to welcome all this instead
[03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:26.320]  of attacking constantly uh he's doing a grave disservice uh to our democracy and the really
[03:08:26.320 --> 03:08:31.600]  awful thing is that republicans particularly in congress but also an awful lot of the republican
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:38.240]  quote establishment and voters are going along and enabling him to make these claims and make
[03:08:38.240 --> 03:08:44.400]  everything the issue but what really happened here and has our democracy been and our elections
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:50.800]  been undermined with some cooperation from the trump campaign from members of his family from
[03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:56.480]  the president himself the answer might be no he ought to welcome the answer if indeed things are
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:03.520]  as he claims what an unabashed liar roger if i was on that set it would it would take every
[03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:08.960]  ounce of my integrity not to sock him right in the face you know the the funny thing oh and is i
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:13.600]  know carl bernstein and i kind of like him i mean he's actually a pretty decent guy to have a beer
[03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:20.000]  with and kind of joke around he's not a bad guy but in this case i'm really disappointed because
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:26.080]  bernstein in the past has been a guy who has been willing to go where the facts lead him he wrote a
[03:09:26.080 --> 03:09:32.800]  terrific piece for rolling stone some 15 years ago about the central intelligences uh uh co-opting
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:42.400]  and uh and getting into using mainstream media uh and paying mainstream media reporters in this
[03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:47.920]  case he seems to be antithetical to the facts he she read the facts lead and the facts show that
[03:09:47.920 --> 03:09:59.520]  the fbi has very very uh uh sadly been politicized and their mission has been corrupted uh so
[03:09:59.520 --> 03:10:05.760]  disappointment rather than anger at carl bernstein because frankly he knows better the old carl
[03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:10.640]  bernstein would have been writing about the corruption of the fbi not helping poo poo it
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:15.600]  and cover it up you know i'm glad that you brought me back down to earth by saying that roger because
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:20.800]  you know when we talk about these political things and people just spout out lies i mean again this is
[03:10:20.800 --> 03:10:25.840]  why people like well why do you get so mad they're lying i mean this guy's just lying and then people
[03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:31.840]  actually believe it i mean why do you think let me ask you you know carl he's a nice guy you guys
[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:36.080]  go out and have a good time i believe that that's true we're all human at the end of this so what
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:42.880]  motivates him to i mean does he really believe what he's saying well it has to be a at this point in
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:49.200]  his career a political point of view but uh one cannot look at the stunning evidence that we saw
[03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:56.720]  regarding peter strach regarding uh the corruption of the fbi and just write it off as meaningless
[03:10:56.720 --> 03:11:03.760]  look we saw this theme from brian stelter last week when he said trump is undermining law enforcement
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:10.480]  and he's one undermining respect uh you know for our law enforcement institutions no what he's doing
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:16.880]  is criticizing people who have burrowed their way into law enforcement and have corrupted that process
[03:11:16.880 --> 03:11:22.080]  there's a very substantial difference they're trying to poke themselves in the credibility of the
[03:11:22.080 --> 03:11:28.560]  fbi and the credibility of the cia you see john brennan the former cia director trying to do this
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:35.680]  constantly but the sad fact is those institutions have been politicized and they no longer stand
[03:11:35.680 --> 03:11:43.120]  for the rule of law they had been engaged in a massive uh corruption of our electoral process
[03:11:43.120 --> 03:11:51.840]  and the cover-up of massive crimes uh it's it's very very sad in my opinion you know uh the oh
[03:11:51.840 --> 03:11:57.840]  and the other thing on my mind today uh is the fact that i predicted last week on the alex jones
[03:11:57.840 --> 03:12:05.680]  show and on the war room that uh the special counsel mr mulier will seek to get the upper hand
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:12.960]  again in his epic battle to take down the president through the indictment of a member of the president's
[03:12:12.960 --> 03:12:21.120]  immediate family his son-in-law jerry kushner now we know that general mike flinn who i believe is a
[03:12:21.120 --> 03:12:28.240]  great patriot and who i know for a fact continues to be a hundred percent supportive of the trump
[03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:35.600]  administration and this president and his mission has testified that a senior member of the presidential
[03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:42.320]  transition instructed him to reach out to the russian ambassador to set up a meeting let me stress
[03:12:42.320 --> 03:12:49.280]  that the action by general flinn and reaching out to the ambassador is entirely legal is within the
[03:12:49.280 --> 03:12:56.080]  scope of general flinn's responsibilities as the national security advisor now if that uh was not
[03:12:56.080 --> 03:13:01.760]  the president who gave that instruction but a senior member of the presidential transition
[03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:07.680]  the only senior member of the transition who would have that authority would be mr kushner
[03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:15.520]  now whether mr kushner has dissembled about that or whether he's been tricked into denying it
[03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:22.880]  in the many hours of of interrogation that he's had from both the fbi and the senate and house
[03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:30.640]  committees we don't know but i could see a scenario in which mewler seeks to get the
[03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:38.240]  upper hand again by bringing a process indictment against kushner as he had against general flinn
[03:13:38.240 --> 03:13:45.360]  to me this would be the perfect opportunity now while the president is on a political high
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:51.920]  to pardon both general flinn a great patriot and his son-in-law who in this case i think has
[03:13:51.920 --> 03:14:00.320]  done nothing wrong and put mewler back on his heels that is both my prediction and my wish
[03:14:00.960 --> 03:14:07.920]  today earlier today the president's pardon me general flinn's brother joseph flinn called for
[03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:17.600]  the president to pardon uh michael flinn again uh a great patriot so i say from joe flinn's mouth
[03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:24.400]  to god's ear well and i do believe that there was a moment where trump was addressing members of the
[03:14:24.400 --> 03:14:29.280]  press where he kind of floated the idea out there about thinking about pardoning mike flinney
[03:14:29.280 --> 03:14:34.720]  obviously didn't want to commit to it but you know the reason why they're so upset with president
[03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:42.640]  trump is the alphabet bureaucracies don't like the fact that they can't put out misinformation
[03:14:42.640 --> 03:14:47.680]  and lies without trump addressing it on twitter they don't like that they like to be able to lie to
[03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:51.440]  the public and not have the president set the record straight so they don't like that then on
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:56.960]  the other end of it in the media they don't like the fact that trump is pushing back i think that
[03:14:56.960 --> 03:15:01.280]  that's honestly what bothers the carl bernstein's in the media the fact that they'll say something or
[03:15:01.280 --> 03:15:05.680]  report something inaccurate and then trump goes on twitter or does a presser and he says no that's
[03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:11.840]  fake news no your fake news your fake news jimacosta i think that that's they don't want president
[03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:17.040]  trump to push back they just want to be bullies without any pushback that's why it's absolutely
[03:15:17.040 --> 03:15:21.920]  essential the president never give up his twitter feed and never be talked out of not tweeting
[03:15:21.920 --> 03:15:27.840]  from the heart i'm roger stone with my co-host oh and shoyer we're on the alex joneshow and

[03:20:33.360 --> 03:20:37.600]  this is the fourth hour of the alex jones show oh and shroyer roger stone with you
[03:20:38.560 --> 03:20:44.240]  breaking through the lies and misinformation of the mainstream media which has never been
[03:20:44.240 --> 03:20:53.120]  been more apparent than it is well then it was in 2017 and that it is now all you have to do is
[03:20:53.120 --> 03:20:57.920]  look at the clear bias in the media coverage of trump you can compare that to presidents in the
[03:20:57.920 --> 03:21:03.920]  past oh wait no you can't because there's never been anything like it and you know that's a story
[03:21:03.920 --> 03:21:08.080]  roger that kind of gets lost in translation i mean you look at the numbers there's never been a
[03:21:08.080 --> 03:21:13.360]  president get as much media coverage it's not even close in fact the negative coverage of president
[03:21:13.360 --> 03:21:20.400]  trump probably doubles any coverage of any prior president no you're exactly right oh and i think
[03:21:20.400 --> 03:21:27.120]  these things have to be seen in in some context uh let's look at at some of the things that said
[03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:34.160]  by our previous about our previous presidents uh andrew jackson he was vulgar uh he was crude
[03:21:34.800 --> 03:21:40.720]  uh he was outrageous he was a brawler considered today one of our greatest presidents
[03:21:40.720 --> 03:21:47.360]  theora roosevelt he was an egomaniac he was a braggart he was a lightweight he was outrageous
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:54.400]  oops once again one of our greatest presidents see donald trump doesn't fit the mold of the uh
[03:21:54.400 --> 03:22:00.400]  career politician he's not a guy with a wet finger in the wind trying to find out what to say in order
[03:22:00.400 --> 03:22:06.240]  to be popular he speaks from the heart he speaks from the gut he speaks from instinct he doesn't
[03:22:06.240 --> 03:22:12.880]  take polls to find out what he should and should not be saying and so far he's going to be uh one
[03:22:12.880 --> 03:22:19.120]  of our most successful presidents we've already seen a record stock market unemployment at all
[03:22:19.120 --> 03:22:25.200]  time lows the housing market uh in one of the greatest booms of all time the libtards don't
[03:22:25.200 --> 03:22:31.440]  want to admit it but he's on his way to an easy reelection and those who are wringing their hands
[03:22:31.440 --> 03:22:39.520]  about the 2018 elections uh are way premature the 2018 elections are not tomorrow they're well
[03:22:39.520 --> 03:22:46.320]  over a year from now and i predict a republican triumph if the president sticks to his current
[03:22:46.320 --> 03:22:52.560]  agenda oh and i'd be remiss if i didn't mention the fact that we have uh extended all of the
[03:22:52.560 --> 03:23:00.000]  new year's specials at the info war store and these will run through the end of the year with

[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:52.960]  you know it's a it's a it's funny roger because i was just thinking the other day i ran out a
[03:24:52.960 --> 03:24:55.760]  hand soap and i was like oh i got to go to the store and get new hands open i was like wait a
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:25:01.840]  second we sell hand soap we sell household items now so when you think about hand soap and shampoo
[03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:06.640]  when you run out think info wars store dot com instead of going to the grocery store that's
[03:25:06.640 --> 03:25:10.400]  another way you can support us it's something that we don't talk about enough on the auto
[03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:16.080]  ship function i really found to be excellent because frankly i'm so busy that i forget to
[03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:21.920]  reorder and i got caught short without brain force on a long trip or had to give a couple of
[03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:28.000]  speeches and frankly it was difficult so uh i really like the auto ship function that way
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:34.480]  you're never without these products uh and frankly uh using them consistency consistently
[03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:41.120]  will give you the very best result so uh i really urge folks to use the auto ship
[03:25:41.120 --> 03:25:49.680]  function on the on the info wars store site oh and i gave a uh an interview to c span last
[03:25:49.680 --> 03:25:56.800]  friday which ran the uh sunday in their news makers program where i reiterated the claims
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:26:04.160]  that i've made here on the alex jones show that i firmly believe that the two party duopoly that
[03:26:04.160 --> 03:26:11.520]  have run this country into the ground the elites of both parties uh if they are unsuccessful in
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:18.960]  undermining and removing this president through the special counsel process of robber the executioner
[03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:27.040]  muller they will move to a 25th amendment strategy now i admit that that may be hard to believe
[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:33.520]  today because the president ended the year or is ending the year on such an incredible high
[03:26:33.520 --> 03:26:40.880]  having jammed through his historic tax cuts which i believe will turbocharge this economy
[03:26:40.880 --> 03:26:50.480]  and with the partisanship uh and the naked uh uh mentality of muller's hit squad now revealed for
[03:26:50.480 --> 03:26:59.360]  all americans to see do not underestimate the deep enmity that the ruling elite who have run this
[03:26:59.360 --> 03:27:06.240]  country in the ground have for this president and his politics i believe they will be be back on his
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:14.640]  throat like a pack of hyenas in 2018 and i do believe that the president will persevere once
[03:27:14.640 --> 03:27:22.000]  again i call for the appointment of a special prosecutor in the uranium one matter far more
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:27.520]  effective than firing muller and allowing the mainstream media to whip up a hysteria about
[03:27:27.520 --> 03:27:33.600]  a cover-up the president should demand that the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor
[03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:42.000]  in the matter of uranium one that would once again bring mr muller mr comey mr mccabe and
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:50.000]  mr rozenstein under federal investigation for their own crimes in the cover-up of uranium one
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:57.760]  and the sale of 20 of our strategic uranium reserves to a company controlled by the kremlin you
[03:27:57.760 --> 03:28:04.640]  talk about russian collusion folks there it is hillary clinton and her husband and the entire
[03:28:04.640 --> 03:28:12.560]  obama uh justice department up to their hips in collusion with the russians to steal that important
[03:28:12.560 --> 03:28:17.920]  commodity well it's going to be interesting to see if they want to push this narrative on through
[03:28:17.920 --> 03:28:24.240]  the midterms roger because what we're seeing right now is that the gop is seeing record funding so
[03:28:24.240 --> 03:28:29.200]  the gop is getting all this funding so does that mean they're going to support the candidates that
[03:28:29.200 --> 03:28:33.680]  aren't career politicians that want to go along with trump's agenda or are they just going to put
[03:28:33.680 --> 03:28:37.840]  in a bunch of rhinos and try to bury those that want to go along with trump's agenda that's going
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:42.400]  to be an interesting story to watch but if they continue to push the russian narrative and a new
[03:28:42.400 --> 03:28:50.960]  congress gets in that's behind trump well look out hillary clinton
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:56.000]  it's a no-brainer a big burkey water filter is the one you need period you need a water

[03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:57.280]  at five o'clock eastern today we'll go right into the war room but sitting in for oen today
[03:33:57.280 --> 03:34:05.600]  will be my colleague rob do you know oen nothing i have ever done on info wars has had the reaction
[03:34:06.320 --> 03:34:13.760]  that we got last week from our visit to a gun range there in austin texas where i had the privilege
[03:34:13.760 --> 03:34:23.360]  of uh shooting some of the most extraordinary firearms uh that i have ever uh seen uh the
[03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:31.120]  libtards brains literally exploded into a pink mist over this uh with claims falsely that we were
[03:34:31.120 --> 03:34:39.600]  in some way advocating uh violence or insurrection just the opposite is true we do not advocate
[03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:48.240]  either we will however defend our families we will defend our constitution it's as you know
[03:34:48.240 --> 03:34:56.320]  it's antifa who advocates of violence it's antifa who wears black masks on their faces
[03:34:56.880 --> 03:35:04.880]  we believe in peace we believe in law and order but we are not patsies now last night i took my
[03:35:04.880 --> 03:35:13.520]  family to a local italian eatery here in the fort lauderdale area where i was confronted by punks
[03:35:13.520 --> 03:35:21.120]  telling me that i was the most despicable human being on the face of the planet this happens
[03:35:21.120 --> 03:35:28.720]  virtually every single day uh when libtards feel that they can invade your personal space
[03:35:28.720 --> 03:35:36.240]  on my flight from austin to new york city the other day i was trying to doze only to be awoken
[03:35:36.240 --> 03:35:44.720]  with somebody who had a camera right in my face uh once again insisting uh that i was a despicable
[03:35:44.720 --> 03:35:52.000]  human being because i stand up for our president and for our constitution and i speak out about
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:36:00.800]  about against the deep state in their efforts to convert this country uh to a a non-democratic
[03:36:01.520 --> 03:36:08.480]  uh uh gulag no i'm not going to be silenced i'm not going to be threatened i'm not going
[03:36:08.480 --> 03:36:15.200]  to be intimidated by your threats but once again we are not the ones who advocate violence we
[03:36:15.200 --> 03:36:22.480]  renounce violence i'm proud of my friendship with this president i'm proud to stand with him and i
[03:36:22.480 --> 03:36:29.440]  will continue to speak out against the illegitimate efforts to take him out either through some
[03:36:29.440 --> 03:36:37.760]  illicit uh trumped up process charge by mr. muhler or by a deep state takedown under the
[03:36:37.760 --> 03:36:44.000]  25th amendment roger i'm actually glad that you told that story because i want to provide
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:50.640]  an example on the other end of the spectrum i went out for dinner last night and a group of
[03:36:50.640 --> 03:36:56.720]  young gentlemen came up to me who were trump supporters and info wars fans and shockingly
[03:36:56.720 --> 03:37:02.880]  unlike your experience they were polite they were kind they shook my hand we had a friendly
[03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:08.320]  conversation and instead of just shoving a camera in my face they asked if they could take a picture
[03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:14.080]  with me and i obliged so that's amazing the difference between the anti trumpers and the
[03:37:14.080 --> 03:37:17.360]  trumpers i mean all you have to do is just look at their character look at how they treat
[03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:22.560]  the fellow human being and you can see who the real scum is no you're absolutely right oh and i
[03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:29.840]  find it to be about a 50 50 uh experience in other words when i went to a home slice one of
[03:37:29.840 --> 03:37:35.200]  my favorite spots in austin the other day for a quick pizza in between breaks on info wars
[03:37:35.200 --> 03:37:43.760]  um i was approached by a group of folks uh mixed men and women uh young people who are big info
[03:37:43.760 --> 03:37:49.600]  wars fans wanted a selfie they were polite they were complimentary it was a great experience
[03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:55.280]  they said tell alex jones how much we love him tell owens schreyer how much we love him
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:37:59.920]  no we've got our fans out there there's no question i find it uh that it's geographic
[03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:06.960]  if in your you're in new york city you're going to find more loud mouths and more scumbags if
[03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:12.640]  you're in austin texas uh other parts of texas you're going to find more patriots uh but there's
[03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:21.280]  no excuse for lack of manners there's no excuse for the rudeness uh in the name calling but as
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:27.520]  i have said as one of stone's rules the only thing worse than being talked about is not being
[03:38:27.520 --> 03:38:34.160]  not being talked about and it is better to be infamous than never be famous at all well you
[03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:40.560]  know roger the thing that doesn't get talked about enough is just by publicly supporting
[03:38:40.560 --> 03:38:46.640]  trump or publicly voicing your conservative political ideologies you're you're hated you're
[03:38:46.640 --> 03:38:53.440]  scorned you're dehumanized and i don't think people understand that i didn't get into political
[03:38:53.440 --> 03:38:58.720]  media so that people would hate me i didn't get into political media so that people will be looking
[03:38:58.720 --> 03:39:03.600]  out for me and to try to bring me down oh i got it in it because i have political ideas and i have
[03:39:03.600 --> 03:39:09.280]  conservative beliefs but just like you said when you when you run into you know conservatives or
[03:39:09.280 --> 03:39:12.720]  fans of ours it's always it's always a love fest we're always getting along everyone's smiling
[03:39:12.720 --> 03:39:18.080]  having a great conversation when you run into a libtard or antifa or a trump hater it's always
[03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:23.520]  hate they're always cursing they're angry they're violent and so this is why i understand i was telling
[03:39:23.520 --> 03:39:28.160]  this story earlier i don't know if you heard it but i was back in town in st louis over christmas
[03:39:28.160 --> 03:39:33.360]  break and i had some some friends that i hadn't seen in a long long time but they know what i do now
[03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:38.400]  and they're like man oh and what happened to you you used to be so happy used to be so cool used to
[03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:43.280]  be smiling and friendly and nice everyone now you're just this hateful fear monger full of anger
[03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:50.000]  and rage i'm like wait a second no i'm not i'm the same guy i've always been they're the ones that
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:55.360]  are filled with hate and rage and and and this is the key that i discovered roger and this is what
[03:39:55.360 --> 03:40:04.640]  they don't understand i i have such a capacity for love and i love fellow humans so much that when
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:10.240]  i see my fellow human under attack whether it be the poison in the water whether it be with abortion
[03:40:10.240 --> 03:40:15.200]  whether it be with the vaccines see now you're attacking something i love that's an instinct
[03:40:15.200 --> 03:40:19.920]  to get fired up about that that doesn't mean we're hateful or angry that means we have a defense
[03:40:19.920 --> 03:40:25.280]  of something we love we're not driven by hate we're driven by love they're genuinely driven by
[03:40:25.280 --> 03:40:29.840]  hate of donald trump they're driven by hate of alex jones and they're driven by hate of our
[03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:36.560]  political ideologies the left the democrat party has become the biggest hate group in the history
[03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:43.760]  of this country now i think that's absolutely true i must tell you prior to 2016 i had many many
[03:40:43.760 --> 03:40:50.880]  friends who were democrats uh many professional democrats many friends in the media who i did
[03:40:50.880 --> 03:40:57.840]  not see eye to eye with and in all cases those relations were respectful and cordial i had
[03:40:57.840 --> 03:41:04.960]  friends at cnn i got along pretty well with anderson cooper and brian stelter and others
[03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:13.120]  there but i've seen the deterioration of that and it's not because of us it's because of them
[03:41:13.680 --> 03:41:22.400]  there is a new militancy a a new outrage on the left where they just cannot accept the results
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:31.840]  of the last election look this is really really simple the elections over you lost we put up with
[03:41:31.840 --> 03:41:38.800]  eight years of barack obama i didn't like the obama presidency i didn't like uh the obama
[03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:45.920]  policies but i realized the elections had been taken and were over and that we lost probably
[03:41:45.920 --> 03:41:54.080]  because we nominated two extraordinarily weak candidates what you can't fathom today is their
[03:41:54.080 --> 03:42:00.640]  inability to accept the results of the last election i saw hillary clinton's photo today
[03:42:00.640 --> 03:42:05.280]  she looks like she's gained about 50 pounds since the election looks to me like she can't
[03:42:05.280 --> 03:42:11.840]  accept the results either owen yeah and she's got you know a boot on her foot walking around
[03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:16.960]  people have rumored that that might be some ankle brace uh bracelet you know because she's uh
[03:42:16.960 --> 03:42:20.080]  you know on house arrest or she can't leave the country or whatever i don't know if any of that's
[03:42:20.080 --> 03:42:26.000]  true but you know she was never healthy roger i mean she's been sickly ever since this for years
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:30.880]  now i mean she's got holes in her tongue she can't stop coughing she coughs up little green goblins
[03:42:30.880 --> 03:42:36.640]  into a cup she falls over and faints you know she looks like oh the balloons in the sky oh you know
[03:42:37.280 --> 03:42:42.320]  so i mean yeah hillary clinton that's what it is you're always attracted to something similar to
[03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:47.520]  you hillary clinton is a sick corrupt individual so of course all the sick corrupt individuals

[03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:57.280]  campaign manager for donald trump cori luandowski sexually assaulted her specifically slapping her
[03:48:57.280 --> 03:49:09.760]  on the rump at a public party at the trump hotel in washington dc as i understand the media reports
[03:49:10.560 --> 03:49:17.120]  an inebriated luandowski approached her was introduced by a mutual friend
[03:49:17.840 --> 03:49:24.400]  whereupon he smacked her on the bottom she asked him to stop and then he smacked her again
[03:49:24.400 --> 03:49:33.040]  uh now we have a clip of mr luandowski uh in his response and in all fairness let's roll that so
[03:49:33.040 --> 03:49:39.520]  that he can have his say here as well singer joy villa a trump supporter filed a sexual assault
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:45.200]  complaint against former trump campaign manager cori luandowski villa claims that she was assaulted
[03:49:45.200 --> 03:49:50.800]  at a party at the trump international hotel in washington last month joining us now is
[03:49:50.800 --> 03:49:56.320]  cori luandowski and cori of course they'd like to have your response uh to to villa's accusations
[03:49:58.320 --> 03:50:02.720]  well charles i think uh as someone who's been through this you understand that there is a due
[03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:07.920]  process and uh there is a process which they will go through to determine a person's innocence
[03:50:07.920 --> 03:50:12.480]  which i think you've been through and you understand and you respect it yeah i think everyone
[03:50:12.480 --> 03:50:17.440]  understands the respect in this but a lot of people are wondering why someone who's so close to
[03:50:17.440 --> 03:50:22.000]  to president trump as you are someone who's been rooting for president trump like joy has
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:27.280]  evade her what do you think is motivating her uh with with these accusations where she says she
[03:50:27.280 --> 03:50:33.040]  has at least two witnesses you know charles that's a question for her i'm not here to speak for joy
[03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:37.680]  what i am here to do is to speak for me and uh what i am going to do is to let the process play
[03:50:37.680 --> 03:50:44.480]  forward just as you did when you're accused of sexual harassment in your own case uh there you
[03:50:44.480 --> 03:50:51.040]  have it cori luandowski's response now i think it is important to know that joy villa has uh two
[03:50:51.040 --> 03:50:59.040]  witnesses and is my understanding the dc metropolitan police have obtained the security camera footage
[03:50:59.040 --> 03:51:07.200]  from that night at the trump hotel so indeed let's let the process uh uh go forward i'm a believer in
[03:51:07.200 --> 03:51:15.680]  due process but i must say i believe joy villa i have found her to be an articulate uh and a
[03:51:15.680 --> 03:51:21.600]  vivacious uh a proponent of the president's agenda i think that her support for the president
[03:51:21.600 --> 03:51:30.240]  is most valuable and we'll be covering both sides of this story oh and well i got a couple things
[03:51:30.240 --> 03:51:36.960]  to say here um let me just start with the sexual assault allegations now i'm not talking about this
[03:51:36.960 --> 03:51:44.800]  individual case i'm just saying in general um is slapping someone on the butt wants really sexual
[03:51:44.800 --> 03:51:49.840]  assault i mean is this really something that needs to go to court i guess you can ask that uh women
[03:51:49.840 --> 03:51:54.080]  that but if a woman slapped me on the butt a couple times because she was drunk uh i wouldn't be
[03:51:54.080 --> 03:51:59.520]  thinking about a lawsuit you've got stories where women are saying trump asked me for my phone number
[03:51:59.520 --> 03:52:04.400]  so i mean we're really skating on a thin line here i think with what is sexual assault and i think
[03:52:04.400 --> 03:52:10.800]  we need to remember that there are actual victims out there that you know deal with penetration
[03:52:10.800 --> 03:52:16.800]  and rape like bill clinton's victims so you know before you start throwing around sexual
[03:52:16.800 --> 03:52:20.800]  assault because someone you know patted you on the butt or whatever or asked for a phone number
[03:52:21.360 --> 03:52:24.720]  i think we need to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves here again i'm not necessarily
[03:52:24.720 --> 03:52:30.480]  commenting on that one story just commenting overall in general but then roger oh my gosh you
[03:52:30.480 --> 03:52:37.600]  want to talk about bombshell you're telling me that the dc metropolitan police are reviewing
[03:52:37.600 --> 03:52:42.800]  footage of this alleged sexual assault is that what you said that that's my understanding now
[03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:49.360]  okay but real quick i just got a pause right there so so so the dc metrics wow the dc metropolitan
[03:52:49.360 --> 03:52:56.320]  police are reviewing footage of cor lewandowski allegedly slapping joy villas but yet nothing
[03:52:56.320 --> 03:53:02.480]  on set rich i can't get any footage on set rich i can't get any investigation to set rich
[03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:09.040]  we get nothing on set rich and we have police looking at footage of joy villa and cor lewandowski
[03:53:09.040 --> 03:53:13.840]  boy if that doesn't show you how backwards and twisted justices right now i don't know what
[03:53:13.840 --> 03:53:19.840]  does sorry roger this is just crazy well but in this case uh miss villa has filed a formal
[03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:25.440]  complaint with the dc police oh and there's a huge difference between somebody smacking another
[03:53:25.440 --> 03:53:31.840]  person and asking for a telephone number yes under the laws of the district of columbia
[03:53:31.840 --> 03:53:38.720]  that does amount to sexual battery to sexual assault so let's let the process carry through
[03:53:38.720 --> 03:53:45.760]  here what i do object to is this idea that for example because lee and tweeden was once a
[03:53:45.760 --> 03:53:54.480]  playboy model she cannot be sexually harassed or or assaulted or that because there is a photo
[03:53:54.480 --> 03:54:01.360]  of joy villa that is somewhat sexy that she cannot be sexually assaulted i firmly firmly
[03:54:01.360 --> 03:54:09.680]  disagree let's let the process uh take it it's a course but photos of her like we're showing now
[03:54:09.680 --> 03:54:16.480]  are have nothing to do with what transpired because someone is photo is depicted in a
[03:54:16.480 --> 03:54:23.040]  sexy attire does not mean that they cannot be sexually assaulted they most definitely can
[03:54:23.040 --> 03:54:28.320]  and i'm just glad i mean again you know my opinions are my opinions i would hope that
[03:54:28.320 --> 03:54:32.560]  from now on at least you know when people are going to make these allegations if you're seriously
[03:54:32.560 --> 03:54:36.800]  going to make these allegations i mean at least follow through you know i'm saying if this is
[03:54:36.800 --> 03:54:40.640]  going to happen at least follow through so 30 years down the road if someone wants to you know
[03:54:40.640 --> 03:54:44.960]  run for office or something all of a sudden oh he assaulted me 30 years ago he can't run for
[03:54:44.960 --> 03:54:48.800]  office now so i mean at least that's one thing i mean if you're gonna if you if you think you're
[03:54:48.800 --> 03:54:53.360]  sexually assaulted at least you know move forward with some charges so at least that's one thing
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:54:59.120]  well and she has she has done that which is the appropriate thing to do here look i have been a
[03:54:59.120 --> 03:55:05.760]  critic of kori londowski that is no secret uh this is not the first time he's been accused
[03:55:05.760 --> 03:55:11.600]  of manhandling a woman inappropriately uh there was an entire period in which the campaign of
[03:55:11.600 --> 03:55:19.520]  donald trump got off message because of his alleged uh uh roughing up a reporter a woman
[03:55:19.520 --> 03:55:26.800]  reporter during the campaign while at a campaign appearance here in florida so um there's a pattern
[03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:35.760]  here that i find disturbing let's see where the process goes oan well and again um i think it's
[03:55:35.760 --> 03:55:42.720]  not i saw no stories of the dc police looking at any camera footage the night of seth rich murder
[03:55:42.720 --> 03:55:48.560]  i know it's a totally different story and everything that to me is just like whoa okay so uh who knows
[03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:52.800]  if if they ever saw any of that footage but apparently uh investigations into seth rich may
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:58.560]  or may not be um getting a little more interest well we've got uh just over a couple minutes left
[03:55:58.560 --> 03:56:03.040]  here or just over a minute and a half left here roger before you go over to the war room what
[03:56:03.040 --> 03:56:06.160]  are you guys going to be covering over there today well i think we're going to be talking
[03:56:06.160 --> 03:56:13.280]  quite a bit about the the general flinn situation uh and the fact that his brother joseph has made a
[03:56:13.280 --> 03:56:21.040]  very i think strong appeal for a pardon now is the time of year that the president uh can
[03:56:21.040 --> 03:56:27.920]  met out mercy and has the full authority for a pardon i think a pardon for general flinn would
[03:56:27.920 --> 03:56:36.160]  be appropriate he has clearly uh been entrapped let's be very clear first they illegally surveilled him
[03:56:36.160 --> 03:56:41.280]  to learn everything he was doing then i imagine they came up with a list of questions and then
[03:56:41.280 --> 03:56:45.440]  they burst into his office at eight o'clock in the morning when he had no attorney present
[03:56:46.240 --> 03:56:52.160]  and the good general spoke to them openly uh they probably went through a list of questions
[03:56:52.160 --> 03:56:58.560]  until they found some place where he contradicted himself to me the whole process is phony his
[03:56:58.560 --> 03:57:05.280]  confession is phony and he's being crucified unfairly i hope with all my heart that the president's
[03:57:06.160 --> 03:57:11.440]  will consider a pardon for general flinn like you i was encouraged the other day
[03:57:11.440 --> 03:57:18.000]  when asked about this and the president said well let's see to me that was leaving the door open
[03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:23.520]  and at least you know he's considering it or has thought about it so i would completely agree
[03:57:23.520 --> 03:57:29.440]  general flinn wasn't trapped he does not belong uh he doesn't you know what's been charged against him
[03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:34.240]  it's just made up it's ludicrous they made up the entire investigation roger stone
