[00:00.000 --> 00:19.360]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on
[00:19.360 --> 00:21.640]  and do nothing.
[00:21.640 --> 00:26.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[00:32.520 --> 00:40.760]  It's 11-11, Friday, November 11, 2016, I am recharged, refocused, and I can see the enemy's
[00:40.760 --> 00:47.880]  battle plan, prepare because I will lay out the clearest, most accurate analysis of the
[00:47.880 --> 00:54.040]  globalist counter-strike and how we defeat them for good straight ahead, but first.
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.320]  So when you stand and deliver that State of the Union address in no part of your mind
[00:58.320 --> 01:03.600]  or brain, can you imagine Donald Trump standing up one day and delivering a State of the Union
[01:03.600 --> 01:04.600]  address?
[01:04.600 --> 01:10.120]  Well, I can imagine it in a Saturday night's skit.
[01:10.120 --> 01:12.560]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be President.
[01:12.560 --> 01:15.840]  He will never be President of the United States.
[01:15.840 --> 01:19.040]  Donald Trump will never be elected President of the United States.
[01:19.040 --> 01:25.360]  Now Donald Trump is not going to become President of the United States.
[01:25.360 --> 01:28.200]  Donald Trump is not going to be President of the United States.
[01:28.200 --> 01:34.560]  However, respectful of the fact that the people have not voted, he's not going to be President
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.560]  of the United States.
[01:35.560 --> 01:38.240]  But Donald Trump is not going to be President of the United States.
[01:38.240 --> 01:40.480]  Let's be clear, Donald Trump will lose the election.
[01:40.480 --> 01:46.360]  I have one thing to say, one thing only, and that is that this race is over.
[01:46.360 --> 01:49.240]  I think Donald Trump will be the nominee and will lose badly.
[01:49.240 --> 01:52.960]  No one's going to be happier than President Obama when Trump loses.
[01:52.960 --> 01:53.960]  No one.
[01:53.960 --> 01:54.960]  That's for me.
[01:54.960 --> 01:57.120]  I think that Donald Trump's campaign is over.
[01:57.120 --> 01:58.280]  Like it's a zombie, right?
[01:58.280 --> 01:59.600]  Like it's a walking dead.
[01:59.600 --> 02:00.600]  It's not...
[02:00.600 --> 02:01.600]  There's nowhere for him to go.
[02:01.600 --> 02:05.360]  And the fact that most people think Donald Trump is going to lose probably means Donald
[02:05.360 --> 02:06.360]  Trump is going to lose.
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.480]  When the inevitable happens, which is a very substantial landslide victory on November
[02:11.480 --> 02:12.480]  8th.
[02:12.480 --> 02:15.400]  And we need, when this race is over, to talk about why that was.
[02:15.400 --> 02:17.120]  I personally think this race is over.
[02:17.120 --> 02:18.800]  To me, this race is over.
[02:18.800 --> 02:23.520]  Politico's latest survey of political insiders agrees, quote, Clinton will crush Trump in
[02:23.520 --> 02:24.520]  November.
[02:24.520 --> 02:31.160]  Well, at real Donald Trump, at least I will go down as a president.
[02:31.160 --> 02:32.160]  No.
[02:32.160 --> 02:35.600]  You were never a real president.
[02:35.600 --> 02:37.840]  You were a globalist, operative, installed.
[02:37.840 --> 02:41.080]  This is the return of the Republic.
[02:41.080 --> 02:45.440]  We have a beachhead now in Washington that's been captured by the globalist.
[02:45.440 --> 02:51.320]  And if President-elect Trump acts like a true American, he will be able to drain that swamp.
[02:51.320 --> 02:53.520]  But understand something.
[02:53.520 --> 03:00.680]  The crocodiles, the sharks, the grendels that live in that swamp are not going to let him
[03:00.680 --> 03:04.360]  do it without trying to take him and us out with him.
[03:04.360 --> 03:07.320]  He cannot make deals with them.
[03:07.320 --> 03:10.640]  He must prosecute Hillary and the other top criminals.
[03:10.640 --> 03:13.960]  He must remove Paul Ryan, who's been caught in the WikiLeaks with Hillary.
[03:13.960 --> 03:16.840]  He's done if Trump moves against him.
[03:16.840 --> 03:23.000]  Trump, in his first six months to a year, has the Arthurian sword he's pulled from a
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.000]  stone.
[03:24.000 --> 03:25.000]  I'm going to say this again.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  To pull the sword, he is half the battle.
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.320]  The second half is using it.
[03:33.320 --> 03:34.320]  He's the president.
[03:34.320 --> 03:36.000]  We've been occupied by foreign outside powers.
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.000]  It is not authoritarianism to say that if he has to encamp the U.S. military in Washington
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.640]  to arrest these people and bring them before juries or kick the foreign operatives out,
[03:46.640 --> 03:47.640]  he has to do it.
[03:47.640 --> 03:49.680]  We are under espionage attack.
[03:49.680 --> 03:51.680]  Russia kicked the Soros group out.
[03:51.680 --> 03:54.760]  Soros must be arrested.
[03:54.760 --> 03:56.400]  And the people are behind Trump.
[03:56.400 --> 04:00.960]  Now, Trump's playing nice with him right now because he's not in power yet and he's in
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.000]  the maximum danger of the next 70 days.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  Total danger.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.920]  He is a major vector target right now.
[04:10.920 --> 04:12.920]  Attack vector.
[04:12.920 --> 04:20.240]  They are coming at him from every side and I'm here to tell you.
[04:20.240 --> 04:24.640]  The best sign I saw was him not telling the mainstream media when he was leaving Washington
[04:24.640 --> 04:29.040]  or where he was going or when he was leaving New York and just totally ignoring them.
[04:29.040 --> 04:31.280]  That's a good sign because that's not media.
[04:31.280 --> 04:39.000]  It's globalist occupied enemy forces of disinformation and America hate that are absolutely discredited
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.520]  and hated and he needs to support the new independent media which is going to continue
[04:43.520 --> 04:48.840]  expanding regardless and point out it's real and totally ignore them and draw a demarcation
[04:48.840 --> 04:56.200]  line because we see the evidence they're only intensifying their attacks right now.
[04:56.200 --> 05:01.240]  Thank God they're so arrogant.
[05:01.240 --> 05:05.360]  Three days after the election of Donald Trump and the reality of a Trump presidency is starting
[05:05.360 --> 05:06.360]  to hit home.
[05:06.360 --> 05:10.080]  For some people this is such a devastating notion that they need to call an ambulance
[05:10.080 --> 05:11.760]  or even want to die.
[05:11.760 --> 05:15.600]  Well we Trump voters care about our fellow Americans and we're pained by this.
[05:15.600 --> 05:17.560]  So let's help the Trump protesters.
[05:17.560 --> 05:20.080]  Let's try to help them recover from their devastation.
[05:20.080 --> 05:24.280]  If you see a Trump protester or a group of them, give them a diaper, hand them a binky,
[05:24.280 --> 05:25.280]  cover them in a blankie.
[05:25.280 --> 05:27.840]  After all, this is what you do for crying babies.
[05:27.840 --> 05:31.520]  Many of these people look like they need a hug so give them a box of huggies.
[05:31.520 --> 05:35.680]  We Trump voters can't stand to see our fellow Americans so depleted so we will make sure
[05:35.680 --> 05:39.080]  to get as many of them a warm bottle of milk as possible.
[05:39.080 --> 05:42.960]  To make America great again, we must make sure that these babies are taken care of with
[05:42.960 --> 05:45.720]  plenty of diapers, vinkies and rattles.
[05:45.720 --> 05:50.040]  Don't worry Trump protesters, remember we're stronger together even if you do have to wear
[05:50.040 --> 05:51.040]  a diaper.
[05:51.040 --> 05:54.080]  This is Owen Troyer from Infowars.com.
[05:54.080 --> 06:01.080]  This message is paid for by the Russians.
[06:54.080 --> 07:05.360]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[07:05.360 --> 07:09.640]  produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[07:09.640 --> 07:13.080]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[07:13.080 --> 07:15.280]  it's very, very important.
[07:15.280 --> 07:21.920]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[07:21.920 --> 07:25.440]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes, but when it runs out you
[07:25.440 --> 07:26.440]  start dying.
[07:26.440 --> 07:30.600]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[07:30.600 --> 07:33.480]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[07:33.480 --> 07:35.120]  It works like an antioxidant.
[07:35.120 --> 07:38.120]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[07:38.120 --> 07:42.240]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount, it's in powder form.
[07:42.240 --> 07:44.960]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[07:44.960 --> 07:47.640]  I take this, this is the product that I take.
[07:47.640 --> 07:54.240]  We fight the globalists, we fight the new world order, secure your DNA Force today at
[07:54.240 --> 08:02.960]  infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[08:02.960 --> 08:15.280]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[08:15.280 --> 08:19.640]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[08:19.640 --> 08:26.080]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[08:26.080 --> 08:30.600]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure,
[08:30.600 --> 08:33.960]  wanton, kinsmen of totalitarianism.
[08:33.960 --> 08:39.880]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary
[08:39.880 --> 08:42.640]  Clinton's economic agenda.
[08:42.640 --> 08:45.840]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[08:45.840 --> 08:52.560]  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world, while the factories
[08:52.560 --> 08:57.040]  and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit.
[08:57.040 --> 09:01.880]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new
[09:01.880 --> 09:02.880]  dark age.
[09:02.880 --> 09:06.920]  That's what the UN biological diversity assessment 1996 called for.
[09:06.920 --> 09:14.520]  When we abandoned the policy of America first, we started rebuilding other countries instead
[09:14.520 --> 09:15.520]  of our own.
[09:15.520 --> 09:20.120]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger, a world
[09:20.120 --> 09:25.120]  that gets uglier and stupider and more stunking.
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.920]  Government should allow Hillary Clinton to become president of the United States.
[09:29.920 --> 09:31.920]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[09:31.920 --> 09:33.240]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[09:33.240 --> 09:35.720]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.560]  If you want an image of the future, Winston, it's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[09:40.560 --> 09:46.960]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[09:46.960 --> 09:51.600]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all of these countries she took money against.
[09:51.600 --> 09:56.680]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely, they're mistreated.
[09:56.680 --> 09:58.560]  She claims to be their champion.
[09:58.560 --> 10:01.760]  Don't look at me, Winston, and see the black circles around my eyes and see how ugly and
[10:01.760 --> 10:06.280]  weak I am expressing myself and dying and I torture people 18 hours a day and I'm a
[10:06.280 --> 10:07.280]  heart of the life.
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.760]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity.
[10:11.760 --> 10:12.760]  We're here to hurt humans.
[10:12.760 --> 10:15.720]  We're here to suck your guts out.
[10:15.720 --> 10:23.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[10:23.680 --> 10:29.280]  That sounded pretty extreme a couple of months ago and I read from 1984 and basically paraphrased
[10:29.280 --> 10:34.160]  a little bit of the end there about how the priest of power, Satanist in government, want
[10:34.160 --> 10:37.520]  to hurt themselves, hurt you and hurt everybody else, but then you get the WikiLeaks and it's
[10:37.520 --> 10:44.320]  all about keeping us poor, hurting us, hating us, hating each other and you guessed it,
[10:44.320 --> 10:45.320]  Satanism.
[10:45.320 --> 10:47.000]  This is what really goes on in the world, folks.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.760]  This is what's happened in every culture and every civilization when decadence hits a
[10:50.760 --> 10:58.840]  certain bottom level and it appears worldwide that we have gone to the bottom of this particular
[10:58.840 --> 11:05.280]  mine shaft, this particular trench, this particular gateway to hell and may be trying to scrabble
[11:05.280 --> 11:08.520]  up towards the surface.
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.880]  But if people say, Alex, be more happy about this election, we've hit bottom, hopefully.
[11:13.880 --> 11:20.240]  We're now trying to go back to the surface and I've never been some deep sea diver but
[11:20.240 --> 11:26.200]  I've been 80, 90 feet down and can't get water out of my mask and start to panic and
[11:26.200 --> 11:33.680]  just relax and just kick your fins and go back to the surface and I feel like we're
[11:33.680 --> 11:37.760]  trying to get back to the surface but I'll be honest, I don't know how much water is
[11:37.760 --> 11:40.880]  on top of us, I don't know how deep we went, do you?
[11:40.880 --> 11:47.840]  Just what I know of is super deep, super dangerous and let's be honest, it's always worse than
[11:47.840 --> 11:49.000]  I thought, isn't it?
[11:49.000 --> 11:56.200]  My only mistake is that it's almost always worse than Jones thinks.
[11:56.200 --> 12:03.120]  I am sickened by how on target I've been so far, I've not been pleased with our analysis
[12:03.120 --> 12:06.600]  turning out to be dead on.
[12:06.600 --> 12:09.800]  Dead on as far down as I can see.
[12:09.800 --> 12:12.640]  You keep swimming down, it keeps getting deeper, doesn't it?
[12:12.640 --> 12:15.960]  But it feels like we've hit bottom and we're trying to struggle up right now and we've
[12:15.960 --> 12:22.920]  got enough air in our tanks but we cannot celebrate yet because I put a video out yesterday
[12:22.920 --> 12:26.680]  and I said he's in the most danger he's ever been, they've said in all these newspapers
[12:26.680 --> 12:30.560]  and TV shows killing, nothing was ever done because the Justice Department wouldn't allow
[12:30.560 --> 12:33.680]  the Secret Service to call for prosecution and believe me, the Secret Service called
[12:33.680 --> 12:35.960]  for the prosecution thousands of times.
[12:35.960 --> 12:43.080]  They caught people planning attacks on Trump and couldn't do anything, lawlessness, Soros
[12:43.080 --> 12:46.680]  funding, all these destabilization groups.
[12:46.680 --> 12:49.960]  They're not playing games so I've shot a lot of special reports warning of this in the
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.520]  past, I shot one last night and I saw some of the trolls going oh Alex, whatever you
[12:53.520 --> 13:01.200]  fear monger, really today articles on info wars.com, massive, massive, massive calls
[13:01.200 --> 13:06.480]  for Trump to be killed in the media and on Twitter and on Facebook and then we have people
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.520]  on CNN and on MSNBC saying it's time to kill Trump, kill his supporters, it's time for
[13:11.520 --> 13:18.120]  blood and the media is like nodding their head trying to call for a revolution when
[13:18.120 --> 13:23.120]  we just saw the revolution against the media, against the foreign banks, against Hollywood.
[13:23.120 --> 13:30.720]  Do you understand, you just lost the revolution and you stole five states and you still got
[13:30.720 --> 13:33.360]  your ass handed to you.
[13:33.360 --> 13:40.600]  That's why they were also stunned, the tsunami was so mega hammer that you couldn't stop
[13:40.600 --> 13:45.800]  it, your seawall wasn't big enough, so Katy Perry again says we need revolution, we need
[13:45.800 --> 13:50.360]  to get violence, let me tell you something tart and I know your daddy, he's been on the
[13:50.360 --> 13:55.120]  show and I know Russell Brand and I woke Russell Brand up to a great extent, he said it on
[13:55.120 --> 13:59.240]  the show and you used to be awake, in fact you pretty much broke up or I spoke up with
[13:59.240 --> 14:02.920]  each other over the fact that you wanted to go the whole Hitlerian route I guess with
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.040]  the Democrats and Brand doesn't like either group, but sweetheart this is the real world,
[14:08.040 --> 14:12.880]  do you want to play general, if there is a big bloody civil war you're going to get prosecuted
[14:12.880 --> 14:17.760]  lady, you can't sit up there and tell 50 million fans it's time to get violent, you know how
[14:17.760 --> 14:22.800]  many racial attacks there were against innocent white people yesterday, so many I can't even
[14:22.800 --> 14:29.960]  keep track of them, and again Katy you're a beautiful woman, you're very talented, your
[14:29.960 --> 14:38.400]  dad's a listener, he's been on the show, I know all the inside baseball, stop, stop,
[14:38.400 --> 14:43.520]  this Dave Mustaine told me all this stuff and I got contacted by her dad and I don't
[14:43.520 --> 14:46.840]  want to get into all of it, the Katy Perry is a very haunted person and I feel sorry
[14:46.840 --> 14:51.280]  for her and I don't want to go off on some jag about her, it's just come on Katy, Hillary's
[14:51.280 --> 14:56.080]  not a nice lady, just because you're a record company, some big globalist operation Hollywood
[14:56.080 --> 15:03.280]  controlled tells you to act like a fool, stop it, but I'm not going to digress, if Trump
[15:03.280 --> 15:08.680]  gets killed, I want to explain something to the New World Order, I think they get this,
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.200]  it's only going to make our movement for nationalism against globalism three or four times stronger,
[15:14.200 --> 15:18.560]  he's such a strong leader and such a patriot, hold on, I got to take this, got to play a
[15:18.560 --> 15:27.280]  tape guys, of course my phone's not working, but this is bizarre, you play the Paul Joachim
[15:27.280 --> 15:29.120]  Watson, hello?
[15:29.120 --> 15:33.860]  After weeks of taunting Trump supporters over Trump's suggestion that he might not immediately
[15:33.860 --> 15:38.960]  accept the election result, Hillary voters came together, preached a message of unity
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.080]  and graciously accepted Donald Trump's victory, oh no, they actually rioted, attacked people
[15:44.080 --> 15:48.960]  in the street and threatened to kill Donald Trump and his supporters, he refused to say
[15:48.960 --> 16:00.320]  that he would respect the results of this election, now make no mistake, by doing that
[16:00.320 --> 16:07.560]  he is threatening our democracy and the peaceful transition, the peaceful transition of power
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.680]  is one of the things that sets us apart, it's how we hold our country together no matter
[16:12.680 --> 16:19.680]  who's in charge, all year they preached the mantra, love trance hate, all year they denounced
[16:19.680 --> 16:25.400]  us as being hateful and intolerant and what's the first thing they do after the election,
[16:25.400 --> 16:30.720]  engage in rampant hateful intolerance, this tolerant liberal called for people to die
[16:30.720 --> 16:36.400]  to prevent Trump from taking office, we can't just do rallies, we have to fight back, there
[16:36.400 --> 16:41.320]  will be casualties on both sides, there will be because people have to die to make a change
[16:41.320 --> 16:47.120]  in this world, look at this idiot, wall street is the enemy, not muslims or immigrants, you
[16:47.120 --> 16:52.600]  just voted for someone whose entire campaign was funded by wall street, you ought to f***
[16:52.600 --> 16:57.440]  more on, look at this clown, I am gay, I am in love, I am terrified, yeah you didn't
[16:57.440 --> 17:03.560]  seem to be too terrified by 20% of Hillary's campaign being funded by a country that still
[17:03.560 --> 17:08.160]  executes gay people, seriously has anyone told you people that you can't change the
[17:08.160 --> 17:14.120]  result of a democratic election by throwing a temper tantrum, the electoral college isn't
[17:14.120 --> 17:18.280]  going to look at you burning a Donald Trump effigy and think, oh well a bunch of butt
[17:18.280 --> 17:23.200]  hurt losers had a hissy fit, so I guess we better just invalidate the entire election
[17:23.200 --> 17:28.880]  and just have everyone vote again until Hillary wins, this isn't fair, I need Hillary to stand
[17:28.880 --> 17:36.120]  up right now and walk in and sue the United States of America, that's not how it works,
[17:36.120 --> 17:43.400]  you're literally protesting against free democratic elections, your behavior is why Trump won
[17:43.400 --> 17:49.480]  in the first place, do you understand that yet, Americans saw you attacking innocent
[17:49.480 --> 17:56.720]  people burning a f*** down and rioting all year and they responded by voting against
[17:56.720 --> 18:03.440]  what you represent, also you're carrying Mexican flags while chanting Trump is not my president,
[18:03.440 --> 18:09.360]  you know that this is America right, do you know what country you're actually in, SJWs
[18:09.360 --> 18:13.760]  are trying to pressure the electoral college to disregard the vote altogether, because
[18:13.760 --> 18:20.480]  blocking the outcome of legitimate free elections because you don't like the result is so progressive,
[18:20.480 --> 18:25.720]  it's not what dictators in third world countries do at all, now Katy Perry thinks that she's
[18:25.720 --> 18:33.040]  Shae Guevara, rise up the revolution is coming seriously, f*** off to North Korea, you'd like
[18:33.040 --> 18:39.040]  it there, you won't have to worry about elections because your candidate wins every time, look
[18:39.040 --> 18:44.160]  at the unhinged insanity that motivates these people, I remember yesterday when I was naive
[18:44.160 --> 18:47.880]  and I thought the September 11 attacks were the worst thing that could happen to America,
[18:47.880 --> 18:53.360]  yeah that's right, 9-11 a terrorist attack that killed thousands of people that led
[18:53.360 --> 18:59.200]  to multiple wars that killed hundreds of thousands more people and ruined the Middle
[18:59.200 --> 19:03.800]  East, Donald Trump is worse than that, yay let's all get ready for world war two, hey
[19:03.800 --> 19:08.960]  d***, world war two already happened, I have friends that are literally scared for their
[19:08.960 --> 19:12.440]  lives, personally I don't think a president should have that kind of mass effect on people,
[19:12.440 --> 19:17.200]  they're probably scared because for the last year you've been regurgitating hysterical
[19:17.200 --> 19:23.560]  media propaganda about how Donald Trump is literally Hitler, it's your own fault that
[19:23.560 --> 19:28.760]  they're scared of a democratically elected president, and it's the media to blame for
[19:28.760 --> 19:33.640]  inciting these anti-Trump riots, they're even paying people to play the role of anti-Trump
[19:33.640 --> 19:39.000]  agitators, if Trump supporters had reacted to a Hillary victory like this, the media
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.880]  would be denouncing them right now as dangerous, democracy hating bigots, the media is also
[19:44.880 --> 19:49.760]  reporting on all this as if it's some kind of spontaneous grass roots uprising, wrong
[19:49.760 --> 19:56.080]  again, it's been coordinated and paid for by billionaire globalist scumbag George Soros
[19:56.080 --> 20:00.960]  and move on to AUG, in Austin the protesters were even loaded onto special...

[24:08.600 --> 24:14.520]  Crazy. I got so excited when I saw who was calling me that I was like trying to do the
[24:14.520 --> 24:21.920]  swipe to answer it. And it wouldn't work because I was so excited. Only if you were that excited.
[24:21.920 --> 24:24.760]  It's like in the harm movie, trying to get your key in the car to start it when the monster
[24:24.760 --> 24:28.480]  is coming after you. But you're so excited you dropped the keys. Well, this is the opposite.
[24:28.480 --> 24:33.120]  So excited I couldn't even get the thing swiped properly. I tell you, the twilight zone nature
[24:33.120 --> 24:38.080]  of my life has certainly gone into beyond bizarre. But I'm just going to stop right
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.600]  there. We should obviously have some interesting news for folks by this evening. And over the
[24:42.600 --> 24:48.240]  weekend you want to stay tuned to infowars.com. I'll just leave it at that for you. And again,
[24:48.240 --> 24:54.400]  not bragging about info wars. I'm bragging about you. They did the numbers last night
[24:54.400 --> 24:59.120]  and I've been saying 75 million tuned in the last week just on Facebook and Twitter and
[24:59.120 --> 25:05.360]  our own internal videos on YouTube. I'm sorry, Zimmerman is doing the numbers right now to
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.880]  finish it up. But it was right around 90 million last night when I left at about seven o'clock.
[25:10.880 --> 25:22.040]  90 million people in the last seven days just on videos. And I mean, one video with two
[25:22.040 --> 25:25.080]  million, one with five million, one with three million. And it's like pieces of the stream
[25:25.080 --> 25:29.600]  because you can't just put like a seven day stream out. So we chop it up every two hours,
[25:29.600 --> 25:33.120]  four hours, six hours, spending on when we're here overnight. It's like a six hour chunk.
[25:33.120 --> 25:39.800]  We were only gone two hours. We cut them in pieces, people like shorter pieces. But this
[25:39.800 --> 25:47.640]  is big pieces and it had 90 million views. That's bigger than Fox folks. They're in their
[25:47.640 --> 25:52.160]  own world and Trump knows they're in their own world. Fox is the biggest thing out there.
[25:52.160 --> 25:56.200]  And that's why he just dissed the entire media. The most positive thing I've seen because
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.440]  we made the joke that once he gets into office, it's one thing that he has some establishment
[26:00.440 --> 26:05.160]  folks that guide him through the minds of Moria. He used the Lord of the Rings analogy. They
[26:05.160 --> 26:08.440]  were not a JR or Tolkien fan. You won't know what I'm talking about, but I'm thinking most
[26:08.440 --> 26:11.920]  people are from the movies. It's one thing he has a guide that's kind of a bad guy to
[26:11.920 --> 26:18.680]  take him through the minds of Moria or under the mountain. But if you, you know, if you
[26:18.680 --> 26:23.120]  catch him kissing goblins or if you catch him in bed with a goblin, you know, that's
[26:23.120 --> 26:28.360]  a problem. If you say signs on to the TPP, that's in bed with a goblin. Trump charging
[26:28.360 --> 26:34.840]  into a goblin's nest, kissing goblins, goblin vomit, catching him in bed with a goblin.
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.240]  Now, because we're going to have a new scale here. I'm actually going to have it made digitally
[26:39.240 --> 26:43.680]  where it's on a scale of goblins. You know, is it charging into a goblin's nest, hacking
[26:43.680 --> 26:49.040]  them to pieces? Or is it just going, you know, around the goblins? Is it kissing goblins?
[26:49.040 --> 26:52.540]  Even though you still stab them, you get a kiss? Or is it catching him in bed with a
[26:52.540 --> 26:58.640]  goblin? And then the final scale, just Trump going to have babies with a goblin and actually
[26:58.640 --> 27:03.080]  help the new world order and turn against us like Darth Vader. She's going to marry
[27:03.080 --> 27:08.640]  a goblin. She's learned about another level of the scale, not just in bed with a goblin,
[27:08.640 --> 27:13.120]  marry a goblin. That'll be all over the news now. And then they think it's just crediting
[27:13.120 --> 27:17.400]  to attack us with that. And then all it does is make everybody love us that more. See,
[27:17.400 --> 27:25.440]  today in the WikiLeaks, we're saying, let's, let's, you know, let's push Trump because
[27:25.440 --> 27:30.320]  he'll discredit the whole GOP and then if he becomes the nominee, we'll be able to defeat
[27:30.320 --> 27:34.080]  him. Now, pretty soon they figured out, no, he's actually popular. He's going to destroy
[27:34.080 --> 27:38.680]  us within a few months. So they changed all that too late. He got the nomination and then
[27:38.680 --> 27:42.960]  he defeated Hillary who tried to steal the election in a landslide. And now Wolf Blitzer
[27:42.960 --> 27:49.320]  is whining and bitching like someone robbed him. This is outrageous. This is incredible.
[27:49.320 --> 27:54.560]  You didn't have a press conference with us, water. This is unacceptable. And then he just
[27:54.560 --> 28:00.600]  flew off and didn't even tell us from DC to New York. I said this on air. I hope he moves
[28:00.600 --> 28:05.560]  out of the White House. It's too small. It's not safe and moves into one of his big mansions
[28:05.560 --> 28:09.640]  and builds a big armored wall around it and puts in big, you know, facilities for the
[28:09.640 --> 28:13.800]  secret service and everybody else. He's got mansions next to office buildings and just
[28:13.800 --> 28:19.400]  has his own, own White House. Just break with everything except the Republic. Move out of
[28:19.400 --> 28:24.240]  that captured nest. Move back in once we recapture Washington, but don't move into the middle
[28:24.240 --> 28:29.480]  of the enemy encampment. Move out of there just spiritually you need to and all the
[28:29.480 --> 28:35.240]  surveillance and all the spies and all the crap. It's just absolutely horrible. Only
[28:35.240 --> 28:39.040]  go there maybe a few days a week and have that be your other office and just get away
[28:39.040 --> 28:42.800]  from these people. And I said, don't do press conferences with them. Do your own big daily
[28:42.800 --> 28:48.680]  announcements and then do like they do. Say, we're going to just bring in the Patriot media.
[28:48.680 --> 28:52.680]  Hmm. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. And here comes all the correspondents, hundreds and hundreds
[28:52.680 --> 28:56.920]  of them. But you know what? We're not as bad as they are. So you know what? No, let's just
[28:56.920 --> 29:02.280]  have it open to everybody. The point is, is that dissing these people is key. Now I get
[29:02.280 --> 29:06.040]  the fact that so the stock market wouldn't plunge and so there wouldn't be bigger riots.
[29:06.040 --> 29:11.320]  He trade, played the part of the conciliatory, the facilitator to go and meet with Obama
[29:11.320 --> 29:14.880]  and say, you're a good person. You know, we owe you for what you've done. It was a total
[29:14.880 --> 29:15.880]  lie.
[29:15.880 --> 29:21.000]  But he was kissing a goblin. The goblin did not look pleased. I will tell you, uh, because
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.480]  you understood what Trump was doing was, was devastating him. And of course it was a lesser
[29:25.480 --> 29:30.520]  man next to a real man, a self-made man, Obama, a globalist, operative, destroying this country
[29:30.520 --> 29:36.520]  and his own people. But it's a big day. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a new day. It's a new life.
[29:36.520 --> 29:41.000]  Birds flying high. I'll tell you, I know how they feel. We're going to play that coming
[29:41.000 --> 29:49.760]  back. Good stuff, baby. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:49.760 --> 30:00.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.720 --> 30:05.240]  The NFL is considering some serious changes as ratings continue to plummet. Some of the
[30:05.240 --> 30:09.840]  changes include reducing ads and ad time, reducing the time of game to perhaps even
[30:09.840 --> 30:13.680]  changing the way it's officiated. These were among the things mentioned by NFL Commissioner
[30:13.680 --> 30:18.560]  Roger Godel to increase ratings, but he failed to mention the protest of our country by some
[30:18.560 --> 30:24.680]  of its players like Colin Papernick, Erica Reed, Kenny Schills, Jackie Tartt, Elizabeth
[30:24.680 --> 30:29.320]  Harreld and Luz Irving, who have been protesting the country during the national anthem, which
[30:29.320 --> 30:33.680]  without a doubt is affecting ratings. Wait, the players in the league are protesting the
[30:33.680 --> 30:38.080]  people in the country who drive the high ratings and the ratings are dropping? Shocking. But
[30:38.080 --> 30:42.840]  the PCNFL can't address this. Perhaps the silver lining in all of this is that people
[30:42.840 --> 30:47.640]  are less inclined to being obsessed with football all day long and have been following the presidential
[30:47.640 --> 30:52.160]  election as well as other local and national issues that they see they can affect with

[31:59.880 --> 32:04.160]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question. Will you and your family be financially protected
[32:04.160 --> 32:08.280]  if there's another economic meltdown? Like many experts, I believe another devastating
[32:08.280 --> 32:12.880]  crash is coming. I think it's a matter of win, not if. Don't wait for another crisis
[32:12.880 --> 32:16.520]  that could wipe out your hard-earned money. Do what I did and call United States Gold
[32:16.520 --> 32:23.400]  Vault at 844-541-ALAX. It's a company I trust. They're offering gold and silver coin survival
[32:23.400 --> 32:28.200]  packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown. I'm talking real
[32:28.200 --> 32:32.480]  money, not paper or worthless stocks. China recently bought more than a billion dollars
[32:32.480 --> 32:37.840]  worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move. Gold and silver are recognized worldwide
[32:37.840 --> 32:43.640]  as one of the most stable means of protecting finances. Don't delay. Call 844-541-ALAX
[32:43.640 --> 32:48.800]  now and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag to securely store your coins, absolutely free.
[32:48.800 --> 32:54.000]  These are dangerous times, and you need to make financial protection a priority. I personally
[32:54.000 --> 32:58.960]  own these survival packs, and you should too. Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALAX
[32:58.960 --> 32:59.960]  now.
[32:59.960 --> 33:26.960]  You know how I feel. Sun in the sky. You know how I feel. Breeze drifting on by. You know
[33:26.960 --> 33:40.920]  how I feel. It's a new dawn. It's a new day. It's a new life. For all of us, it would
[33:40.920 --> 34:07.480]  just take it in our hands. Because this is 1776. Yes. You know I'm feeling good. I have
[34:07.480 --> 34:11.800]  a feeling that the tumblers go into my brain for days after victory. Couldn't sleep. You
[34:11.800 --> 34:16.960]  know how I feel. Because I hadn't gotten the approximation yet for victory. And then I
[34:16.960 --> 34:21.600]  saw it all click. You know how I feel. And then I knew the next moves they'd make yesterday.
[34:21.600 --> 34:32.280]  And then all of a sudden, I saw it going exactly like I'd envisioned. And I'm feeling good.
[34:32.280 --> 34:38.520]  It's a hell of a species. Fins are too much. Every time somebody thinks they're gonna take
[34:38.520 --> 34:45.480]  it down. Every time there's some nut grip that's in competition with their own kind.
[34:45.480 --> 34:51.120]  Things get bad. Real bad. It's always darkest before the dawn. And that human spirit made
[34:51.120 --> 34:58.320]  the image of God turns on. And the high voltage switches get flipped. And those little rat
[34:58.320 --> 35:02.440]  bastards that thought they were gonna piss all over the better men and women of this world
[35:02.440 --> 35:08.800]  find out that there were people a lot better than them. A lot smarter than them who weren't
[35:08.800 --> 35:15.440]  seeking power. But who weren't gonna have our heads rubbed in the mud. Ladies and gentlemen,
[35:15.440 --> 35:20.760]  that which does not kill you only makes you stronger. And we are living in a very, very
[35:20.760 --> 35:24.960]  epic times. I will say this about the big enemy attack. If you go to CNN.com, I did
[35:24.960 --> 35:29.000]  this morning. Half the stories, I mean, I was counting them. I think it was more than
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.760]  half, but it may have changed by now. But we're about white people were ignored. This
[35:32.760 --> 35:37.840]  is why this happened. White lash. Poor whites did this. Poor whites did that. Whites, whites,
[35:37.840 --> 35:42.240]  whites, whites, whites, minorities scared of whites, extremism rising, hate crimes
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.560]  by whites rising. They are literally telling Hispanics, blacks and Asians, you can't have
[35:47.560 --> 35:51.960]  low taxes. You can't have prosperity. You can't have Second Amendment. You can't have
[35:51.960 --> 35:58.760]  a controlled border and security. They're literally engaged in divide and conquer as
[35:58.760 --> 36:03.040]  we've seen before. But this shows us they're not capitulating to the people's will or to
[36:03.040 --> 36:10.760]  what the market wants or what to would make CNN and MSNBC successful. No, they are going
[36:10.760 --> 36:15.680]  on with what they've done that has brought them to rack and ruin. So I say, good. Doesn't
[36:15.680 --> 36:19.200]  matter whether Donald Trump compromises or not. I don't think he will. You people have
[36:19.200 --> 36:25.920]  not compromising with American people. And so we are what's driving all of this and you're
[36:25.920 --> 36:31.240]  done. So I am very, very positive right now because pretty much any avenue we go down,
[36:31.240 --> 36:36.920]  you are screwed. You have no credibility. You are totally delusional. And Americans
[36:36.920 --> 36:40.960]  of every race, color and creed are sick of this crap. And they know what Donald Trump
[36:40.960 --> 36:45.120]  really stands for. Common sense. Russia has done nothing to us. We're not going to have
[36:45.120 --> 36:50.640]  a war with you. Islamists are running wild in 30 countries killing people in mass invading
[36:50.640 --> 36:55.680]  us saying, kill us. We're going to blow the hell out of you. It's the return of common
[36:55.680 --> 37:02.000]  sense, not rocket science. And all I'm saying to everybody who's been drinking the kool-aid
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.920]  of Hillary and all this crap and George Soros, Kennedy, one of the last true Democrats cut
[37:06.920 --> 37:12.520]  taxes by 50% in the main tax brackets of middle class and poor people and tax receipts double.
[37:12.520 --> 37:17.640]  Do you get that through your brain? Reagan increased spending too much for the Democrats.
[37:17.640 --> 37:21.480]  They basically tripled it. It didn't matter if tax receipts went up 70-something percent.
[37:21.480 --> 37:27.240]  We went into debt. It was wrong. It was wrong. But it's better than the Democrats trying
[37:27.240 --> 37:30.680]  to destroy the damn country. And they were heavily involved in that. So just popping
[37:30.680 --> 37:36.440]  in is Roger Stone. I am so busy with sponsors I got to take care of and ads I got to deal
[37:36.440 --> 37:39.640]  with and actually running this place. I've been for weeks, don't even focus on that,
[37:39.640 --> 37:42.760]  I'm going to go off in an hour and Paul Watson's coming up. We're going to air a bunch of special
[37:42.760 --> 37:46.560]  reports to be very, very powerful. I'm going to pop in later in the broadcast, but I've
[37:46.560 --> 37:52.120]  just got too much to do and I've got to do it while I have my early day energy. So I'm
[37:52.120 --> 37:58.200]  going to be leaving, but big broadcast today. But I wanted to get Roger to pop in because
[37:58.200 --> 38:02.120]  I'm very, very positive. Obviously, Trump's going to have to have some guides into Washington.
[38:02.120 --> 38:05.800]  I'm very pleased with what Pence has done, delivering the goods on pro-life and so much
[38:05.800 --> 38:11.160]  more. I trust him. I don't trust neocons to carry out the president and the people's agenda.
[38:11.160 --> 38:16.800]  We see some of those folks coming in. If they fully get behind the agenda, side issue, but
[38:16.800 --> 38:21.320]  regardless, do not go along with Paul Ryan, remove him. He's been caught in WikiLeaks
[38:21.320 --> 38:27.480]  with Hillary Pelosi, read their own party wants amount, get rid of that old guard establishment
[38:27.480 --> 38:32.180]  that incessuously work together to screw the people and get folks in that want a prosperity
[38:32.180 --> 38:38.440]  driven system. Trump isn't out to get it. So I haven't really talked to stone. I don't
[38:38.440 --> 38:41.560]  know what's on his plate. I talked to him early. So we just pop in for 10 minutes. You've
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.760]  been in New York. He's obviously met with the president elect, but he can't get into
[38:45.760 --> 38:50.000]  that inside baseball. This is a very exciting time, Roger. And I do want to celebrate now
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.960]  that I've had some sleep. Congratulations to you, baby. You're an MVP. Folks have no idea
[38:54.960 --> 38:58.720]  like you're the Merlin of this whole deal behind the scenes, helping put King Arthur
[38:58.720 --> 39:03.440]  on the throne. But I got to tell you the, the superhuman strength of Trump, not letting
[39:03.440 --> 39:10.560]  up feeding off of, of combat. My God, this is total presidential stuff compared to the
[39:10.560 --> 39:12.600]  scum we've had in the last 20 years.
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.800]  Well, Alex, first of all, it's great to be back with you. I spoke to President elect
[39:17.800 --> 39:22.720]  Trump last night at some length on a broad variety of topics. And I'm not really at
[39:22.720 --> 39:27.920]  liberty to discuss that, but let me just say that he is first of all, very grateful to
[39:27.920 --> 39:34.160]  the info wars.com audience. He knows that you are the centerpiece of the resistance.
[39:34.160 --> 39:41.200]  He knows that he has gotten a better treatment here than from anyone in the mainstream media.
[39:41.200 --> 39:48.320]  And he is, and he is very grateful and very thankful for your support and the support
[39:48.320 --> 39:55.240]  of your audience. Secondarily, he is, I think, trying to get his head around some of the
[39:55.240 --> 39:56.240]  extraordinary national.
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.720]  Yeah, let's be clear. He's got a lot of stuff going on. I'm, in fact, I'm quite embarrassed
[40:00.720 --> 40:04.320]  that he's actually reached out. I already say thank you. I mean, this is crazy what
[40:04.320 --> 40:08.480]  he's doing. And now I'm totally working 18 hours a day still. I'm kind of actually worried
[40:08.480 --> 40:10.640]  about him at 70. Is this Superman?
[40:10.640 --> 40:20.080]  No, look, I told him this, at the end of the day, he is the one who won this. His enormous,
[40:20.080 --> 40:26.160]  enormously energetic sprint, the final two weeks of this campaign was almost superhuman.
[40:26.160 --> 40:31.120]  This reminded me of Harry Truman, who jumped on a train and went from one coast to the
[40:31.120 --> 40:36.240]  other doing four stops a day until he could no longer speak and pulling out an upset.
[40:36.240 --> 40:42.360]  Trump put forward a Herculean personal effort here. And at the end of the day, Alex, I think
[40:42.360 --> 40:50.400]  he won despite his campaign. By that, I mean his campaign. God bless them. They were grassroots-oriented,
[40:50.400 --> 40:56.440]  guerrilla-oriented operation. We didn't have the slick, you know, well-financed operation
[40:56.440 --> 41:02.160]  of the Clintons. But at the end, it didn't matter because Trump, Trump's talent, Trump's
[41:02.160 --> 41:08.680]  ability as a communicator, Trump's enunciation of the anti-elitist method.
[41:08.680 --> 41:14.320]  His instinct. I've been watching him carefully. He's got an instinct that is second to none.
[41:14.320 --> 41:20.080]  Now the other thing I can tell you is there are many, many people in the political establishment
[41:20.080 --> 41:27.600]  advising him not to allow the prosecution of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, presumably
[41:27.600 --> 41:34.320]  Chelsea Clinton for their crimes. I personally think that's an enormous mistake. Either we
[41:34.320 --> 41:42.480]  are a land of a nation of laws or we are a nation of men, which is it? There has to be
[41:42.480 --> 41:48.520]  one standard. If David Petraeus can be prosecuted, then Hillary Clinton must be prosecuted.
[41:48.520 --> 41:52.720]  Let me jump in here and I totally agree with you. My advice to Trump is this. A, it's what
[41:52.720 --> 41:59.120]  you said you'd do. B, it's the right thing to do justice. But C, and most importantly,
[41:59.120 --> 42:03.440]  you cannot leave this den of vipers there. They will try to bring you down. They will
[42:03.440 --> 42:08.560]  never stop. You must break these people. As you've already done, the MSM, the Clintons,
[42:08.560 --> 42:13.320]  the minute you go after them with the law and due process, their minions are all mercs.
[42:13.320 --> 42:18.920]  They will roll and we will destroy the entire nest of corruption and you would have won.
[42:18.920 --> 42:22.600]  If you don't do it, they're going to be sniping at you the whole time.
[42:22.600 --> 42:30.080]  He cannot take his foot off their throat. Now, he's beaten them against enormous odds.
[42:30.080 --> 42:34.360]  When King David, I'm going to interrupt again. You're absolutely on target. When King David
[42:34.360 --> 42:39.880]  with that stone hit Goliath while he was praying, he prayed, God, make me aim true. Nobody could
[42:39.880 --> 42:44.640]  beat Goliath. No, he only knocked Goliath out. If he would have hesitated not taking Goliath's
[42:44.640 --> 42:49.040]  sword and chopped his head off, Goliath would have gotten up and strangled him. King David
[42:49.040 --> 42:56.720]  must raise the sword, correct? Absolutely. I think this is why I say lock her up needs
[42:56.720 --> 43:01.880]  to continue to be our watchword. By the way, are you challenged me? I took away the 2016.
[43:01.880 --> 43:04.520]  It's over. I'm announcing. We're designing it today. You're absolutely correct. We are
[43:04.520 --> 43:08.240]  launching. It'll be here in one week. I just did it. We talked some more. We are launching,
[43:08.240 --> 43:13.560]  ladies and gentlemen, the Hillary for President 2017 limited edition shirt will be available
[43:13.560 --> 43:19.920]  by this afternoon in preorder and in forestore.com. Sorry, sir. We are, I think at a key point
[43:19.920 --> 43:26.080]  where former Mayor Rudy Giuliani yesterday on Fox summed this up. This is not a decision
[43:26.080 --> 43:32.760]  for the president. This is a decision for the grand jury. This is a decision for a career,
[43:32.760 --> 43:39.080]  unbiased, non political prosecutor to look at the totality of the Clinton Foundation and
[43:39.080 --> 43:44.080]  the pardons and a hundred other issues that the Clintons have enriched themselves by breaking
[43:44.080 --> 43:49.640]  the law and determine whether there is in fact a criminal indictment there. The other
[43:49.640 --> 43:58.000]  issue here, Alex, is of course the outstanding issue of the 680,000 emails on the Weiner
[43:58.000 --> 44:05.320]  Abaddon server. So when the FBI director says we've reviewed them and there's nothing there,
[44:05.320 --> 44:12.360]  my sources in the Congress who have seen all of them, my sources in the NYPD who have seen
[44:12.360 --> 44:19.800]  all of them tell me that there is open and shot evidence of treason, corruption, sexual
[44:19.800 --> 44:24.840]  exploitation and worse. And we have the earlier wiki leaks where they're with Obama saying
[44:24.840 --> 44:28.920]  we've got to cover this up or illegal emails. We have them. We have them. We have them in
[44:28.920 --> 44:36.320]  gun sites ready. So there can be no reprieve here. This is going to be a very important
[44:36.320 --> 44:42.920]  but I can already see the siren song of the political establishment calling on the president
[44:42.920 --> 44:49.520]  to give the Clintons a pass in order to heal the country and you know, this is nonsense.
[44:49.520 --> 44:55.160]  These are asks. They will bite you. Here's the good news. The president can't give a
[44:55.160 --> 45:00.440]  360 pardon from what I've read in jurisprudence. And so even if Obama gives them one, there's
[45:00.440 --> 45:06.760]  so many thousands of crimes, prosecutors afterwards doesn't matter, new investigations, new crimes.
[45:06.760 --> 45:12.680]  Well I would argue that under the Nixon precedent, Obama could in fact pardon the Clintons for
[45:12.680 --> 45:19.040]  any and all crimes they may have committed. But if that happens, that's a legal process.
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.400]  But the foundations of ongoing crime, the foundations of ongoing crime.
[45:23.400 --> 45:28.800]  She still will have accepted a pardon, which is essentially the admission of a crime. The
[45:28.800 --> 45:33.920]  Clinton Foundation is going to dry up. Who in God's name would give them a penny to stick
[45:33.920 --> 45:36.680]  in their pockets now? Who?
[45:36.680 --> 45:41.600]  I agree. I mean, thank you, Roger, for coming on. Any other points that are key to add? Listen,
[45:41.600 --> 45:45.040]  nobody's perfect. This is so complex. I can't believe he's working 18 hours a day. I'm so
[45:45.040 --> 45:50.400]  impressed. The media is going to try it. Here's the new attack. They're going to now attack
[45:50.400 --> 45:53.840]  us on our strength, liberty and the fact that we don't falter away. They're going to claim
[45:53.840 --> 45:57.920]  he isn't 100% delivering. We have to wait and see and give him time to even get in. We
[45:57.920 --> 46:01.040]  have to worry about assassination, which the media is pushing. So don't let them start
[46:01.040 --> 46:05.480]  claiming, oh, he's bringing in neo-cons or oh, he's doing her that. Donald Shown, he does
[46:05.480 --> 46:12.640]  what he wants. The point is, it's delivering, building the wall, cutting the taxes, standing
[46:12.640 --> 46:17.040]  back and letting prosecution take place. That's what we're waiting for once he's president.
[46:17.040 --> 46:23.280]  In the next 70 days, total defense of Trump, absolute promotion of what he pushes for and
[46:23.280 --> 46:27.720]  keep fighting, keep fighting and exposing MSM. Wasn't it genius to ignore the press
[46:27.720 --> 46:30.760]  core and not tell them where he was going or what he was doing?
[46:30.760 --> 46:36.440]  Yeah, I think CNN is going to have a very hard time getting him on the phone. I think
[46:36.440 --> 46:41.120]  the New York Times is going to have a very hard time getting him on the phone. I think
[46:41.120 --> 46:46.640]  he's wise to ignore them. But Alex, let me also say, any of the names you see floated
[46:46.640 --> 46:54.040]  out there for various positions, whether it's Chris Christie or Rudy Giuliani or Jamie Dimon
[46:54.040 --> 46:59.560]  for Treasury. There's all bull. It's all bulls here, Trump saying, my entire life.
[46:59.560 --> 47:05.680]  It's all self, not that's not true. It is self promotion in most cases. You should not read
[47:05.680 --> 47:11.120]  anything into that. No decisions are made. No lists are made. It's wildly premature.
[47:11.120 --> 47:17.720]  So when the Washington Post reports a piece by Robert Costa saying that Corey Lewandowski
[47:17.720 --> 47:24.560]  is under consideration for chief of staff, no, he is not. That's a plant. That is not
[47:24.560 --> 47:27.800]  true. There is zero chance that that will happen.
[47:27.800 --> 47:31.520]  That's right. Lewandowski is now a CNN turncoat operative.
[47:31.520 --> 47:36.800]  Well, this is the same guy who planted a fake story at the Washington Post that he was in
[47:36.800 --> 47:42.320]  charge of the vice presidential selection process, which he was not. So you see a lot
[47:42.320 --> 47:48.960]  of self promotion. You see the Washington rats all trying to board the ship. The watchword
[47:48.960 --> 47:54.840]  today is I was with you the whole time. Anybody who says that was not with you the whole time.
[47:54.840 --> 47:58.680]  Well, my listeners were with the fact that Trump was a patriot and the elite were against
[47:58.680 --> 48:02.440]  him. And I was a little fly on the wall in the meeting for what really brought down Lewandowski
[48:02.440 --> 48:06.440]  came out and I knew Lewandowski was going down. So I know the inside baseball and it's
[48:06.440 --> 48:10.400]  not some pissing contest with Lewandowski. He's really a bad person. And I want to salute
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.640]  the individual to help bring him down and just thank God there's patriots around Trump
[48:15.640 --> 48:20.320]  protecting him. And listen, nobody's smart enough to have enough eyeballs or brain cells
[48:20.320 --> 48:24.640]  to keep track of something this complex. The fact is the enemy hates Trump. That's why
[48:24.640 --> 48:28.680]  you know he's good. And we're going to give him massive benefit of the doubt until he
[48:28.680 --> 48:33.280]  gets into office. But remember folks, the number one threat from my gut and you see him in
[48:33.280 --> 48:37.440]  the news is them trying to kill Trump. Don't you agree, Roger? That's the maximum threat
[48:37.440 --> 48:38.440]  right now.
[48:38.440 --> 48:44.920]  Look, I pray for his security. I read, I written a book on the Kennedy assassination. I wrote
[48:44.920 --> 48:50.680]  a book on the bushes, which has what I think is the true story of the attempted Reagan
[48:50.680 --> 48:59.720]  assassination. The inappropriate actions of the Secret Service in both of those instances
[48:59.720 --> 49:06.240]  give me pause. Now I think the men and women of the Secret Service are brave loyal Americans,
[49:06.240 --> 49:12.360]  but I worry about the political manipulators above them. So yes, I pray every day for the
[49:12.360 --> 49:21.040]  president's security. The assassination threats, you know, are ubiquitous across the social
[49:21.040 --> 49:25.320]  media. I myself, and I know this is probably true of you. I've gotten more death threats
[49:25.320 --> 49:32.800]  in the last 48 hours than I've gotten in the last 48 years. And I'm about 48 years old.
[49:32.800 --> 49:36.680]  So let's talk about this then. I don't even got to go. I got to go. I'm so in the brain.
[49:36.680 --> 49:43.000]  Rogerstonestone.com, StoneColdTruth.com. Let me ask this question. A little bird told
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.440]  me that Trump a year ago, envisioned he was going to win, understood the people, knew
[49:47.440 --> 49:51.160]  the mainstream media was a joke. So he advertises around the country. He learns it has no response
[49:51.160 --> 49:54.320]  anymore. There's nothing there. You know, you advertise independent media. There's a
[49:54.320 --> 49:57.920]  huge response. You advertise in mainstream, no response. I mean, Trump's a smart guy.
[49:57.920 --> 50:02.360]  He's like, well, they have no power for six, seven years. I advertise. Nothing happens.
[50:02.360 --> 50:06.800]  You know, I mean, that's one thing for Trump is just as a businessman to get there. They're
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.040]  done. This is our country. This is far and run. This whole Soros thing, the globalists,
[50:11.040 --> 50:14.560]  the big banks, they admitted it's come out in the WikiLeaks. And a little bird told me
[50:14.560 --> 50:18.960]  if they think they're going to try to start a war or finance too many riots in the streets
[50:18.960 --> 50:24.240]  or try to burn Washington or something, that we're just going to encamp the US Army and
[50:24.240 --> 50:29.160]  the Marines around the White House and somebody's going to sit in a bunker and sign the executive
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.720]  orders. And if Congress wants to roll over to the globalist, that's fine, but we finally
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.360]  got a president that's going to try to defeat the enemies that have captured this nation.
[50:36.360 --> 50:40.200]  I mean, we have the beachhead now is what I'm saying. He has captured the White House.
[50:40.200 --> 50:45.040]  Now he's got to capture DC and bring the country back. That's how epic this is.
[50:45.040 --> 50:51.240]  I generally agree. I think that their moves will be more subtle than that, Alex. I think
[50:51.240 --> 50:56.280]  there's going to be a major effort to continue to crack down on the lending ability of community
[50:56.280 --> 51:05.320]  banks in a purposeful effort to slow the economy so that can be blamed on Trump. They want
[51:05.320 --> 51:08.000]  to crash the economy and blame it on Trump.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.720]  Oh, I agree. So what does Trump do? He gets up with 70 days and points out with his bully
[51:11.720 --> 51:14.520]  pulpit what they're doing to crash it before he gets in.
[51:14.520 --> 51:19.320]  Yes, he tells his Treasury Secretary to get with the community banks and make sure since
[51:19.320 --> 51:24.920]  they are credit worthy, since they are loaded with cash, that they are lending to people
[51:24.920 --> 51:30.640]  who want to build under Obama in the last eight years, almost nothing to locals, trillions
[51:30.640 --> 51:36.640]  to foreign banks, trillions to China, nothing for us. Trump needs to say you get the damn
[51:36.640 --> 51:41.720]  loans to local people, including black communities right now and the Hispanic communities and
[51:41.720 --> 51:45.880]  the poor communities. Now you get them the loans. They pay them back. You do it right
[51:45.880 --> 51:46.880]  now.
[51:46.880 --> 51:52.220]  Well, and I happen to know that the president elect is looking at some innovative financing
[51:52.220 --> 51:59.840]  options where you could rebuild our infrastructure without using tax dollars. I mean, this can
[51:59.840 --> 52:07.080]  be done where you can, you can essentially get a guaranteed line of credit to rebuild
[52:07.080 --> 52:12.840]  America without squandering sure all the matters is tax cuts and confidence. This country can't
[52:12.840 --> 52:16.560]  be held down. The Federal Reserve used to admit we're overheating. We've got to suppress
[52:16.560 --> 52:21.360]  it. That's the big secret. Trump knows that just turn a few switches, block the globalist.
[52:21.360 --> 52:22.640]  We're going to win, right, Rogers?
[52:22.640 --> 52:26.440]  I think that's exactly right. Look, I think he's going to move towards a sound dollar.
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.520]  I think he's going to move to growth oriented tax policies.
[52:30.520 --> 52:32.600]  Is that why the stock market went up?
[52:32.600 --> 52:38.840]  I noticed that. I noticed that. Very, very, because look, we have a businessman in charge.
[52:38.840 --> 52:43.480]  He understands the economy. He knows how to create jobs. I've never been more confident
[52:43.480 --> 52:44.480]  as I say before.
[52:44.480 --> 52:47.560]  Why don't you make a Wall Street sharing and lock her up, my friend?
[52:47.560 --> 52:54.160]  Yes. Well, we'll get there. I think it's vitally important that he keep his pledge to the American
[52:54.160 --> 52:58.840]  people on those questions. All right, Alex, I'm going back over to Trump Tower, but great
[52:58.840 --> 53:01.880]  to be with you again, and I will keep you posted.
[53:01.880 --> 53:07.080]  There goes Roger Stone, ladies and gentlemen, very exciting times to be alive. I tell you,
[53:07.080 --> 53:13.120]  stonecultured.com, Alex Jones, then fours.com. I've done 53 minutes of this broadcast and
[53:13.120 --> 53:17.120]  I'm not once even sat here and said support us. And that's why I've had to go off air
[53:17.120 --> 53:21.160]  here because I've got ads for advertisers to cut that are about behind. I've got bills
[53:21.160 --> 53:26.480]  to pay, contracts to sign, satellite deals. I mean, I got a lot of crap going on, a lot
[53:26.480 --> 53:29.320]  of good stuff, but I mean, it's just, by the time I see one or three or four, I'm like
[53:29.320 --> 53:35.120]  a zombie and can't make these business decisions. It's where I can still do radio and TV forever,
[53:35.120 --> 53:39.320]  but when it's the business, I've got to really figure out how to fund this thing. So I want
[53:39.320 --> 53:43.600]  to just encourage everybody, if you want to see the main attack ship in this fight, turn
[53:43.600 --> 53:49.760]  into three or four ships and really run the tables on these people.
[53:49.760 --> 53:54.080]  We've got amazing products everybody needs at infowarstore.com. We've got free shipping
[53:54.080 --> 53:58.520]  throughout at least a day or tomorrow. We're selling out of so much stuff. I didn't order
[53:58.520 --> 54:01.960]  enough stuff thinking the sale wouldn't be that big. So it's going to have to end one
[54:01.960 --> 54:06.280]  way or the other, but take advantage of it, free shipping store wide, 30% off, no vitality,
[54:06.280 --> 54:13.120]  30% off X2, the good halogen, 30% off DNA force. Wow, that's a big deal. 30% off living
[54:13.120 --> 54:17.960]  defense, 30% off lung cleanse, 30, 40% off all the high quality, durable foods. That's
[54:17.960 --> 54:22.520]  a big deal. We just extended that out. Our great supplier, my Patriot supply has decided
[54:22.520 --> 54:28.280]  to do that because they're so excited as well. Infowarsstore.com is the main site. Sub-sites
[54:28.280 --> 54:32.720]  to go to the nutraceuticals or supplements, your probiotics, your vitamin mineral fusion
[54:32.720 --> 54:37.720]  fruit punch, your bio PCA for the hair and nails or a knockout sold out. They told me
[54:37.720 --> 54:43.080]  it was sold out. It's still up there. The bio tricillinium, liver cleanse, oxy powder,
[54:43.080 --> 54:46.240]  prostagard, anthroplex. It's just the dry version of the super metal mentality. It's
[54:46.240 --> 54:57.640]  all there. Infowarslife.com or call toll free, 888-253-33139. Triple eight, 253-33139. And
[54:57.640 --> 55:02.080]  that runs right through the weekend. So again, to all the viewers out there, if you want
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.680]  to be part of the next level of the take back of America and the world for free market,
[55:07.680 --> 55:13.200]  through open societies. Notice Soros names this group, the open society because he's
[55:13.200 --> 55:17.280]  the opposite. This is the real renaissance. This is the real freedom. We've broken the
[55:17.280 --> 55:24.040]  back of the enemy. We have taken action to the next level. History is unfolding now.
[55:24.040 --> 55:28.680]  And it is not corporate sponsorship that funded this. It was you, the listeners and viewers
[55:28.680 --> 55:33.960]  that took action. So I want to encourage you. Go to infowarsstore.com right now and take
[55:33.960 --> 55:39.040]  advantage of store-wide free shipping at least for the next 24 hours. And while supplies
[55:39.040 --> 55:45.520]  last 30 to 40% off products across the board, like non-GMO, heirloom seeds, water filtration
[55:45.520 --> 55:53.320]  systems, super cutting edge supplements, storable foods, and so much more on apparel.
[55:53.320 --> 55:58.600]  It's 50 to 15% off, depending on which piece of apparel it is, because I do the made American
[55:58.600 --> 56:02.520]  thing and we make almost nothing on that because it costs so much to do because of how unfair
[56:02.520 --> 56:06.640]  things are. So we can't go more than 15% on made America because we're only making like
[56:06.640 --> 56:12.920]  30% on it. Made in Mexico, made in Venezuela, made in wherever, places like Honduras. Yeah,
[56:12.920 --> 56:18.760]  we can give it 50% off on that because it costs us $5. Made America, $12, $13. Some of the
[56:18.760 --> 56:27.800]  more designer stuff, $25. But it's all there. Infowarsstore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[56:27.800 --> 56:33.480]  I'll be doing special broadcast tomorrow. I'll be obviously back to Sunday, 4 to 6 PM. We've
[56:33.480 --> 56:37.640]  got a bunch of compilations of the best of the last week coming up in the next hour.
[56:37.640 --> 56:42.280]  Clips in my famous interview with Donald Trump because he kept all his promises. I will not
[56:42.280 --> 56:49.720]  disappoint you, boy, didn't he? He did absolutely deliver. And then Paul Watson, the absolute
[56:49.720 --> 56:55.240]  Arthurian warrior from Albion will be joining us. And then we are also going to have a big
[56:55.240 --> 57:00.440]  excerpt, big analysis of the secret of why Trump, one hasn't aired yet, shot it last night.
[57:01.080 --> 57:04.600]  The threat against his life, what's happening there. And so much more. That's going to air
[57:04.600 --> 57:08.280]  in the fourth hour of David Knight hosting about 20, 30 minutes up. It'll be breaking
[57:08.280 --> 57:13.320]  news and analysis, but a lot of it is going to be tapes I shot last night while I was on fire.
[57:13.880 --> 57:19.000]  It's all up on infowars.com. Will they kill Trump before the inauguration? I said that last night.
[57:19.000 --> 57:25.000]  There was just a flotilla of articles today saying, kill him. Kill him now. So this is the crazy town
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.080]  level to which we've reached, but we haven't gotten to the riots all over the country.
[57:29.640 --> 57:34.200]  The story linked on drudgereport.com is an infowars story. High school girl viciously
[57:34.200 --> 57:39.640]  attacked for supporting Donald Trump by black folks. This is just attacks all over the country.
[57:39.640 --> 57:45.000]  You go to CNN though, it's white people are attacking black people. And that means some
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.520]  operative of the government, burn it one foot across in somebody's yard, totally made up.
[57:48.520 --> 57:52.600]  All the church burnings are going to be fake. The black stripper being raped by the lacrosse
[57:52.600 --> 57:56.520]  team fake. It's all finance. It's all fake. I mean, if it was real, I'd report it.
[57:57.560 --> 58:00.600]  Let's say this. It's as rare as finding an Easter Bunny at Christmas, okay?
[58:01.560 --> 58:05.400]  Because most white people in the catatonic state totally guilty. Back when the Klam's
[58:05.400 --> 58:09.880]  run around doing bad stuff, it was like 2% of the population in the south. I mean, just, I mean,
[58:09.880 --> 58:15.960]  they just face it folks. When you're walking down an alley at night in a minority neighborhood,
[58:15.960 --> 58:19.480]  you see a white guy, are you afraid to get attacked? It's just statistically, it's not happening.
[58:19.480 --> 58:24.040]  And it's happening everywhere. They admit it. It's like 100 or something times more likely
[58:24.040 --> 58:27.560]  for white to be attacked by a black person. And it's a minority of blacks doing it,
[58:27.560 --> 58:32.040]  but still crimes rare. But in that group, the media sells it like it's okay.
[58:32.840 --> 58:36.680]  Just like in the fifties, most racial attacks for the KKK against blacks,
[58:36.680 --> 58:39.720]  because it was culturally acceptable. We have to make it unacceptable.
[58:40.680 --> 58:44.200]  Stay weather, simplewars.com. Spread the word. They hate that site.
[58:44.200 --> 58:50.200]  That you've been spreading it, it's been destroying them.
[59:14.360 --> 59:16.840]  We need each day with our modern diets.

[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.640]  Alan Jones here, back live. Bunch of special reports coming up.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:24.680]  Donald Trump in the next segment. But I wanted to mention this because it's so
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:30.440]  sea change. Unacceptable. Wolf Blitzer rebukes Trump for breaches in press protocol.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:36.920]  He just said how horrible it is that it's unacceptable. They have to fix it. The
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.880]  White House Correspondents Association deeply concerned that he isn't telling them
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.920]  everywhere he goes and what he does so they can sycophantically run around behind him.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:53.000]  This is a bunch of arrogant. Nobody's from bad families on average, literally. I don't know why
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.080]  it is. He researched these journals. These have horrible families. Horrible people. No success.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:02.600]  Just the sons and daughters of con artists, criminals, murderers, filth, trash, garbage.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.520]  Just you name it. It's just it's true. They don't build anything. There's a parasite around,
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.760]  butt kiss around. They're just saying, how dare you ignore us in DC and then fly off back to
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:17.400]  New York. Wonderful, wonderful. That's how you help collapse them. Only Trump's glow,
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.120]  giving them energy, can keep these vampires alive. They're like, how dare you not let us suck your
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:28.680]  blood. He doesn't need them. They're not going to turn to his side. So this is a really juicy thing.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:36.440]  Hear this. Going to have to get accustomed to some norms that are in place here in Washington.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:42.760]  Donald Trump, we're told by an aide left Washington earlier this afternoon, got on his plane, returned
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:49.320]  to New York City without any reporters being told that the president-elect was leaving Washington.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.640]  No. He arrived at LaGuardia earlier this evening and then presumably went back to
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.520]  Trump Tower. Wolf, as you know, that is sort of outside the norms of what we expect when we
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:04.840]  cover a president-elect. It is expected that a pool of reporters is kept abreast of his movements.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:11.640]  That's enough. And Wolf Blitzer flips up. I love how he's in a tower. It's like under siege. He gets
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.760]  it because these are the people that lied, said he could never win, said that he couldn't have
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.560]  the nomination, then said they could steal it, then said he didn't deserve the money he raised.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:30.920]  They were wrong about everything on every front and backstabbed time and time and time and time
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:35.160]  and time again. And then now we're just supposed to keep groveling because they've got a big TV
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:41.320]  station and guys in trench coats and scarves looking official when they'd sell their mother
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:46.920]  out for a stick of bubblegum. Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time. And you did it. I wanted 100
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:53.000]  million views over election. We only had 90 million. I'll take it. God bless you. You did an
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.440]  incredible job rubbing it in their faces outside of our terrestrial radio audience that's now
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:03.080]  5 million a day conservatively. That's very conservative. We can say we're bigger than

[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:39.480]  so we will make sure to get as many of them a warm bottle of milk as possible. To make America
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:43.880]  great again we must make sure that these babies are taken care of with plenty of diapers,
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:49.320]  vinkies and rattles. Don't worry Trump protesters, remember we're stronger together even if you do

[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.680]  just in new jersey but new york palestine all over what do you have to say they're still
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:50.040]  attacking you though we've got dan rather on video we've got new york post we've got washington
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:56.200]  post we've got i mean what's going on here well i took a lot of heat and i was very strong on it
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.600]  and i held my line and then all of a sudden you know hundreds of people were calling up my office
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:06.760]  i was the other day in sarasota florida and people are online and we had 12 000 people which is fantastic
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.920]  and the people were saying many of the people from new jersey four or five people said
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:16.280]  mr trump i saw it myself i was there they talked about paterson but they said i saw it myself mr
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:21.880]  trump i was there so many people have called in and on twitter at real donald trump they're all
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:27.160]  tweeting so i know it happened and i held my line and people wanted me to apologize and
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.800]  uh we can't do that people like you and i can't do that so easily now we can do it if
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.600]  we're wrong alex you apologize i'd apologize if i was wrong but they were celebrating and
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.880]  they were celebrating the fall of the world trade center i think that's disgraceful it is and that
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:47.400]  same week you were reporting on that fact we had two different international football games soccer
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:54.040]  games with the turkish fans and others during the moment of silence for the dead people in in paris
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:00.200]  chanting a la hot bar and booing so did that not happen too well that happened and everybody saw
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.880]  it that was a week ago and the players were out on the field and they couldn't believe it they were
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.120]  embarrassed they didn't know what to do the coach and the managers they all apologized but it happened
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:13.560]  look we have to deal with reality and you know it all started because they said we need surveillance
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:19.320]  we need proper surveillance we have people that truly are evil and they're coming from some place
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.120]  and you know sort of where they're coming from at least the vicinity and i said we need proper
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:29.160]  surveillance whether it's a mosque or anyplace else we have to be surveilled and we have to see
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.320]  what's coming at us because we're not going to have a country anymore between the weak borders
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:37.960]  that we have the pathetic and weak borders where politicians are afraid to do anything about it
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:43.560]  between all of what's happening with radical you know you look at what's going on you have a
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:48.840]  president that doesn't even want to talk about you know the radical uh muslim stuff he doesn't
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.240]  want to mention the word he doesn't want to say it but you look at what's happening where we have
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.960]  a president that's over there celebrating global warming and trying to get everybody excited about
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:03.560]  global warming like that's our number one problem he considers that to be our number one problem
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:07.240]  and our number one problem is what's going on where they want to blow up our cities and they want
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.680]  to blow up our country that's our number one problem you said months ago bomb the oil of
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.640]  isis in the in the mainstream media laugh because you said the sky was blue again now the pentagon
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:24.360]  says that's the right thing to do and now you've come out saying quote uh it looks like uh that
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.720]  turkey's on the side of isis closed quote well that the next day the russians released satellite
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.680]  photos documenting that there are literally thousands of trucks coming up to the border
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:41.720]  at these huge terminals connected to eargun the president's son making billions of dollars total
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:47.400]  off of this again you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue well i was right about that
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.480]  i was right in saying in a book that i wrote you covered it really nicely i appreciate it but i
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:57.320]  wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000 the america we deserve and i said in that book
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.880]  that we better be careful with this guy named osama bin laden i mean i really study this stuff i
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:07.240]  really find it very interesting and even though i'm a businessman i find it i've always found i
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.960]  always have been involved in politics i said we better be careful with osama bin laden there's a
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.080]  guy named osama bin lad nobody really know who he was but he was nasty he was saying really nasty
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.360]  things about our country and what he wants to do to it and i wrote in the book 2000 two years before
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.880]  the world trade center came down i talked about osama bin laden you better take him out i said
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:31.160]  he's going to grow under a rock you better take him out and now people are seeing that the thing
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:36.040]  you know trump predicted osama bin laden which actually is true and then two years later a year
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.960]  and a half later he knocked down the world trade center and i talked about terrorism in that that
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.600]  was before terrorism as we know it today i said we better be careful that's going to happen it's
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.160]  going to be a big thing and it certainly is a big thing so with the oil and i'm glad you brought it
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.920]  up but as you know for three years i've been saying you better take out the oil because if you don't
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.960]  take the oil it's going to be a problem so we shouldn't have been in iraq but once we got there
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:04.280]  the way osama the way we came out was was horrible and i said take the oil then we didn't take the
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.440]  oil so isis got the oil and as you know iran is getting the oil because iran is going to take
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.480]  over all of iraq the more i research what you've actually said and done it's amazing you were the
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:21.000]  only leading american figure who openly said do not go to war in iraq they had almost what 90%
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.760]  votes in congress for it bipartisan you said don't do it iran will take over uh you said i mean
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:33.080]  look you can say that today and everybody can say that but you said that in 2001 2002 2003
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:37.560]  when it was very unpopular because you've done your research and had good advisors how did you
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:43.160]  know that when almost no one else did well first of all i'm the most militaristic person there is
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.080]  i'm going to build the mill if i win i'm going to make our military so strong so powerful that
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.560]  nobody's going to mess with us we're going to take care of our vets and all of that but i have to
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.920]  tell you have to know if you're going to go to war you have to do it properly and you have to know
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:14:00.760]  what to do i view it as this iran and iraq were the same in terms of strength and they'd had they
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.320]  constantly fighting that's all they do is they fight right they go to war all the time and they'd
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:09.640]  move 10 feet left 10 feet right 10 feet left then they'd rest and then they started again
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:15.480]  four years ago this has been gone on forever forever and this is the way it is i said if you
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:20.520]  take out iran or if you take out iraq either one you're going to destabilize the middle east well
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:26.840]  we took out iraq and by the way iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world people don't
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.720]  even know that so we gave like incredible we took out iraq i said you're going to destabilize well
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.440]  and i said and you'll know this and you know this and i appreciate what you just said uh
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:42.040]  then iran is going to come in and iran is going to take over iraq and they they're just taking it
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.360]  over right now as we speak they're taking it over iran is running iraq and very soon will be
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.600]  virtually going to be totally running iraq especially after all of the you know the deal we
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:56.680]  just made which is the worst so i said keep the oil and i said if you're going to leave you shouldn't
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.680]  have gone in but they shouldn't have they should have left soldiers behind like 20 000 or certain
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.640]  number of soldiers but if you're going to leave take the oil and i've said it then they left they
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.200]  didn't take the oil so ice has got the oil iran is getting the oil everybody's getting everything
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:15.880]  but us so we lost thousands of soldiers we spent two trillion dollars in iraq we have wounded warriors
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:20.440]  who i love all over the place and what do we get out of it house we had nothing we had nothing no
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.120]  the french and the germans are getting the oil the iranians are getting the oil and you know who
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.480]  the number one customer for the oil is guess what china right how smart is china they are
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:36.280]  smart us on every level militarily they are smart us on trade like we're losing we have a 450 billion
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.920]  dollar trade deficit with china let me ask you this you're a top business guy you know on your own
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:47.720]  from nothing how did china get 97 percent of rare earth in uh uh minerals in the world how is the
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.320]  united states or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals when it's what goes in the
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.280]  smartphones the computers trillions is made a year how did we just give them the global market
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.640]  in that that's crazy well a lot of people don't know afghanistan now afghanistan's a place we can
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.720]  go in because you know you have pakistan and you have nuclear weapons a lot of things going on there
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:11.720]  but we go into afghanistan we're fighting you're tremendous mountains and ridges we're fighting
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.360]  on one side and you know who's got their excavators on the other side china looking out all the
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:21.640]  minerals you know afghanistan nobody knew this afghanistan is rich with minerals not oil but
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:27.160]  minerals everything and china is taking out all the minerals and here we are fighting we have
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.560]  trillions where but like a trillion dollars in afghanistan and we get nothing out of it and
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.720]  we're going to end up leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and just on that we
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:41.560]  get nothing china is taking out the minerals they're the they're the buyers the big buyers at very
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:47.560]  very low prices of as you know of the oil in iraq and probably in syria but china is a big buyer
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:52.040]  of the oil but one thing with the oil it sits over because you've covered it for three years
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:57.080]  i've been saying hit the oil because isis is getting strong and then no jv as the president said
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:02.920]  and they're certainly not contained but i said hit the oil and hit them hard and they left at me
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:07.640]  and they would put generals on television saying no that strategy wouldn't work well after paris
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:12.520]  they started hitting the oil and it does work the problem is we've given them a two-year edge
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.680]  they have billions of dollars the russians started hitting the oil for one month and isis is already
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.880]  rolling over can you speak to as president what your relationship would be with foreign leaders
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:26.760]  and and and what you know about uh vladimir putin because all i know is why are we starting to fight
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.640]  with russia when they're not doing anything to us right well number one and and just to finish on
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.920]  there by the way i say hit the but we should keep the oil in other words we should keep we'll get
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.160]  exxon mobile they'll go in we'll get other of our oil companies we'll get some of the great oil
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.160]  companies we bid it out we should keep the oil you know in the old days to the victor belong
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.480]  the spoils right we don't have that we go in we fight a war and we leave we get nothing except
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:53.000]  we get debt and we get deficit that's all we get uh i think i get along great with people i mean i
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  will probably get along well with him and if i don't somebody else will and who knows you know
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.760]  he's a difficult cookie he's tough and he's smart i was on the show 60 minutes with him recently
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:07.160]  not together i mean we they did him and they profiled me at the same show which was there we
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:12.600]  were stablemates right but i think i'd get along very well with him i think it's too fine but
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.000]  here's the thing we lose with every country and yet we don't get along with any countries china is
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.480]  killing us everybody's killing us china is just beating us to a pulp and trade japan
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:26.600]  mexico is killing us and yet we don't get along with anybody with me they're not going to get so

[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.440]  it feel said it only feels because they said what we've done has never been done before politically
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.920]  you know i've been in the poll for five months since it came out i'm number one i said it's only
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.960]  good if we win if i if i don't win i've wasted a lot of time that's the way i've you said no no you
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.840]  haven't you haven't i said believe me if i don't win because we can't do anything to make our country

[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.000]  rob do with info wars dot com and i would like to be the first to thank white america for ruining
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.280]  the country although i'm not the first in fact van jones went out on election night and got on
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:25.480]  cnn and said it's white lash and that's the reason it happened because white people are so bad and
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:30.280]  evil and mad that they want to send a message that a woman couldn't be president talked about race
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.480]  and we talked about everything but race tonight we've talked about income we've talked about class
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:39.160]  we've talked about reason we haven't talked about race this was a white lash this was a white lash
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:45.880]  against a changing country it was a white lash against a black president in part and then last
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:51.080]  night we had samantha b saying white people ruined america that's right here's the clip people will
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:56.760]  be looking for someone to blame the pollsters the strident feminists the democratic party a vengeful
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:04.040]  god but once you dust for fingerprints it's pretty clear who ruined america white people she then
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.360]  joked and said oh i guess ruining brooklyn was a dry run that's right because somebody who builds
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:15.320]  up properties and hires people to build them and maintain them is running america and running jobs
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.800]  just like he did in dc with the new post office in fact the government gave him the bid and he
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.440]  brought it in under budget and under time that's terrible that's the wrong thing to do donald you're
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:30.280]  doing a horrible disservice to our country but wait we got more comedians here's chelsea handler
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:36.280]  literally breaking down in tears that hillary clinton didn't win and i think i i guess the message
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:42.120]  that i want to like spread out to other women is is exactly what you're saying is not to give up
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:49.880]  sorry i hate my camera but it's not to give up because this is so important and it's it's easy to
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:54.520]  say throw in the towel and that we're gonna leave or i'm gonna move to spain because i want to move
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.600]  to spain i really really want to move to spain right now and i'm gonna get serious here in a
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:03.960]  second but let me show you one more clip here's seth mires wiping away the tears that his mother
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:09.000]  might not get to see the first woman president and whoever you are i hope i live to see your
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.920]  inauguration and i hope my mom does too uh she was really excited yesterday and um i was really
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:22.040]  sad for her and then he went on to say well the first woman president could still be out there
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:26.040]  watching this and then you still get to be the first woman president look people it's not even
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.200]  the point that hillary clinton would have been or not have been the first woman president she's
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:35.400]  an evil bitch that's the bottom line in fact one of her first jobs as a public defender
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.960]  was defending a child rapist and she used tactics on this little girl who we had just
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.480]  behind me in the studio kathy shelton who was 12 years old and she was pulled off her bike and
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:49.960]  gang raped how's that for feminism okay and hillary went on to take evidence and move it
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:55.240]  across state lines she mishandled evidence in this case she actually took this little girl
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:00.760]  brought her up on the stand and made her cry and she was using tactics now that are illegal under
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:06.520]  rape shield laws does that sound like a person that needs to be president they jerk me off my
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:14.600]  bicycle they put me in the truck and they were beating me they and right and they raped me and
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:24.920]  he was saying he knew i liked it except in a more terribly manner than that i um was left out on the
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:32.520]  ground fairly conscious uh sometimes at one time i was unconscious
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.560]  it's pretty funny though watching people like colbert on the colbert report having his election
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.560]  night special when they knew hillary was gonna win they knew without a shadow of a doubt because
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:47.720]  she had sewn it up in the polls and that they had it was just nothing but a little bit of a racist
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:53.320]  white people that were gonna vote for trump and then watching them just almost cry on tv as they
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:59.400]  saw the results coming in it's even funnier watching the young turks as a whole panel watching the
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:06.280]  utter disdain on their faces because they lost get over it let's move on now let's not keep encouraging
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:11.320]  people by going it's only racist doing it because i'm not a racist and i voted for donald trump
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.280]  period and there's plenty of other people that voted for them that aren't racist either and we
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:21.960]  don't have a desire to hate women and ruin this country with misogyny or xenophobia all we want
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:28.600]  to do is protect the border have fair elections and have a decent economy where everybody has
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.080]  a chance to succeed and if you don't want that for people if you think you have to run around and
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:37.560]  take care of everybody then you're the real racist out there rob do reporting for info wars dot com
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.360]  and info wars nightly news good life for a comedy show a no i don't know my shirt is a comedy show
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:53.800]  at this point now and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:59.240]  true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus all of our

[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.960]  it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:20.440]  working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.520]  children would actually like and take we worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional

[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:56.120]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:05.560]  the nfl is considering some serious changes as ratings continue to plummet some of the changes
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:10.680]  include reducing ads and add time reducing the time of game to perhaps even changing the way it's
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:15.400]  officiated these were among the things mentioned by nfl commissioner roger godel to increase ratings
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.920]  but he failed to mention the protest of our country by some of his players like collin paperneck
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:27.560]  erica reid kenny shills jackie tart elizabeth herald and louis erving who have been protesting the
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:32.440]  country during the national anthem which without a doubt is affecting ratings wait the players in
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:36.440]  the league are protesting the people in the country who drive the high ratings and the ratings are
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:42.280]  dropping shocking but the pc nfl can't address this perhaps the silver lining in all of this is
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:46.840]  that people are less inclined to being obsessed with football all day long and have been following
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:51.880]  the presidential election as well as other local and national issues that they see they can affect

[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:20.760]  war it's alex jones we're awaiting donald trump roger stone this is a surreal moment for you tell
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:27.560]  us your heart and soul you know alex i wanted donald trump to run for president as early as 1988
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:35.240]  i arranged for him to speak to the chamber of commerce uh in port smith new hampshire
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:42.600]  and a port smith city councilman named mike dunbar formed the first known draft
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:47.800]  umpere president committee it was still working for trump in the most recent new hampshire primary
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:51.800]  now you gave me a six months ago like a big president oh here's a donald trump 2000 thing nobody's
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:57.800]  got us yeah so uh in 2000 i wanted him to seek the reform party nomination because i could see
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:06.280]  that george bush and al gore were not what america needed uh and uh he did seriously consider that
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:12.680]  briefly uh bros perot urged him to run my friend jesse ventura then governor minnesota urged him to
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:18.840]  run uh and um he did look at it and of course the reform party then was entitled to federal
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:26.040]  matching funds so he would have been running on opm other people's money in the end he made what i
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:30.200]  think was a shrewd calculation that you couldn't win as a third party candidate you could only
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.400]  win as a republican or a democrat three years ago i wanted him to run i signed up again as a
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:42.920]  consultant to his uh exploratory effort uh and the time was really not quite right i was probably
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:51.000]  more for it than he was so this has been a long time coming for me i have taken the beating from
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.760]  my friends and some people who aren't my friends for 30 years of saying oh donald trump come on
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:02.040]  you're out of your mind he's never going to run this is all about burnishing the brand this is all
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:06.760]  about his is uh you know the fact that he's a media whore and he just likes to read his name
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:14.120]  he's never really going to do it so um this is vindication they've been proven wrong in spades
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:20.360]  boy have they a royal flush for roger stone uh it is it is a great night i can't wait to hear
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:26.040]  what he has to say here i would like him to claim this so that the moment will be complete

[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:06.920]  big mega banks have set themselves up against him because they believe they own you i knew a
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:09.320]  year and a half ago when i endorsed ronald trump he was going to win
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:15.560]  and i've talked to him about why i knew that
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:23.720]  but people i know and people i trust that are patriots that have defended this republic
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:29.560]  confirmed to me and i've seen it in donald trump's actions
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:36.840]  that he wanted to restore this republic but i want to be very clear to you very clear
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:41.720]  there isn't about credit it's so that you know the danger
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:47.720]  you've seen the stupid ads with the bunny rabbit that says energizer inside
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.640]  if you want to know what powers donald trump individually it's a love of liberty
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:56:00.200]  and a love of standing up to corruption he's not perfect nobody is but what powers the movement
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:09.240]  is info wars they want to establish a private corporate global government nigel forage
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:17.560]  the leader of uk we come on my show 15 years ago when he barely had a few members of parliament
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:22.280]  now he's a hundred times bigger or more and he would say it's your listeners listening to you
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.040]  in the u.s when i go knock on doors that's why we're getting the uk independence party it's it's
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:31.400]  info wars thank you he said that on the show he thought about us bragging he said the spirit
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:38.920]  of the info war across the world from australia to the uk and russia from nigeria to mexico is
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:48.680]  spreading and it's the renaissance idea of freedom and that's why they're trying to shut us down
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:54.600]  because we're not perfect but we're not out to get people we believe in lower taxes we know
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:57:00.520]  empowering the people's answer we don't want to break up families we're not out to get people
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:06.440]  they are going to try to collapse the world economy they've already been prompting enough
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:11.720]  for a while they're going to blame it on donald trump a global depression they knew they couldn't
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:17.160]  stop the movement so now that he's in they're going to implode the economy and blame him
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:21.640]  when they're the ones who created the derivatives when they're the ones who created the end of
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:26.040]  last eagle when hillary clinton and larry summers did it all they're going to blame donald trump
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:33.080]  how do i know that they threatened the uk they said you try to leave this unelected thing we'll
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:36.920]  implode your economy we'll take your jobs away just like they did iceland or Greece
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:41.720]  some countries fold some fight back we know their plan if you're just conscious and want to know the
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:48.360]  truth it's all there it's not my opinion i want self-determination i won't be held hostage
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:58.920]  so this isn't like buying a lottery ticket where you elect donald trump and beat the establishment
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:04.120]  and then expect the whole gravy train to continue on who wants this fake gravy train
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:09.560]  we need to get back to what makes us human what makes us real and if we're getting ahead of the
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:14.440]  expense of some third world people we shouldn't do it we're getting ahead of the expense of
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:19.880]  our kids we shouldn't do it i saw the enemy truly against donald trump
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:27.640]  spiritually hating him so i backed him donald trump is more a figurehead of liberty than
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:36.360]  ever before and he has the holy ghost protecting no weapon form the best

[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:48.120]  paul joseph watson and as alex has been discussing the whiny butthurt crybaby special snowflakes
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:54.360]  have been all over the streets again protesting against a free democratic election can you imagine
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:01:00.600]  anything more reprehensible these people should move to north korea they won't have any problems
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:07.000]  with elections there their preferred candidate will always win now it's got to the point where
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  they're burning american flags they're attacking people on the street you see the footage here
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.120]  i put up this video last night has already got four five hundred thousand views they're really
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:22.280]  losing the narrative i mean trump riot has been trending on twitter all day they've been vehemently
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:28.440]  debunked in their efforts to try and frame this as a legitimate protest when it is nothing less
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:33.560]  than an anti-democratic disgrace these people should move to north korea right now if this is
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:42.280]  what they're interested in but isn't it funny how we were smeared all year as violent hateful
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:49.160]  bigots yet when it comes down to it it's hillary voters who turn out to be violent hateful bigots
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:53.720]  you know it was funny how they said trump supporters would not accept the result of this
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:02:00.040]  election you heard that for weeks even months they said they would riot if they lost the election
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:06.120]  what's the first thing that hillary voters do they don't accept the election and they go out and
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:14.680]  riot i mean can you remember when after obama won the elections in 2008 and 2012 you remember when
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:20.680]  conservatives were out on the street rioting burning american flags attacking people smashing
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:27.160]  up shops destroying cop cars you remember when conservatives did that after obama won in 2008
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:35.240]  and 2012 no me neither because it didn't happen because conservatives accept election results
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:40.920]  they don't have toys out of the pram temper tantrums on the streets thinking that that's
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:48.840]  going to change anything it comes down to this america is ameritocracy america rewards hard
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:55.400]  work that's what made america great in the first place america doesn't reward whining burning
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:03:04.120]  flags and wallowing in your imaginary oppression okay that's why you lost because your lazy
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:11.080]  self-entitled bedwetting crybabies but they're still out on the streets and they will be out on
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:17.880]  the streets tonight probably throughout the entire weekend actually believing that the electoral college
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:22.440]  is going to look at them burning an effigy of donald trump's head and think oh well we better
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:28.120]  just overturn the entire election result then because some whiny crybabies waving mexican flags had
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:34.920]  a hissy fit no that's not how it works again it's this entire mentality which has driven the rise
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:41.480]  of social justice warriors this mental illness that everybody gets a trophy no everybody doesn't
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:47.320]  get a frigging trophy you have winners and losers in life the winners are the people who really want
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:54.680]  it and who work for it and those were the winners on november 8th you were the losers get used to it
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:04:00.360]  except it move on but they're not going to move on what is the next stage of this that's what we're
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:06.280]  going to talk about during the next hour we're also going to talk about the anti donald trump
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:13.320]  hate crime wave now sweeping america that the rigged debunked corporate media is covering up
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:19.960]  refusing to admit is taking place of course we saw after brexit this big frothing hysteria that
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:25.080]  there were high hate crimes happening everywhere massive explosion of course turned out to be
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:31.080]  complete bs the reporting of hate crimes that increased actual hate crimes had not increased
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:35.960]  now all the hate crimes that are taking place in the aftermath of this presidential election

[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:23.800]  we are back on the third hour of this friday edition of the alex jones show and there's
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:29.800]  a anti-trump hate crime wave sweeping america which the rigged media won't talk about they'll
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:35.480]  have their cameraman on video pretending to be an anti-trump agitator saying that hillary clinton
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:40.920]  needs to sue the united states and overturn the election result and claim that that's an organic
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:46.280]  authentic protester when it's their own cameraman because cnn is rigged we're going to go to that
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:51.720]  video later but they're not reporting on this headline up on info wars dot com video high
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:56.280]  school girl viciously attacked for supporting donald trump of course this is also up on drudge
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:02.760]  report dot com and this is just one example of course we also had up on info wars yesterday
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:07.880]  a school in stafford an 11 year old boy this is in texas was violently attacked after telling
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:14.120]  classmates he voted for donald trump you can see this video here this is the girl being attacked
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:21.400]  this is in california basically this violent intolerant liberal accused her of hating mexicans
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:27.640]  because she posted something that was pro trump on instagram and within two minutes instantly
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:34.680]  launched into a brutal assault because she's a tolerant peaceful liberal if this was an isolated
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:40.680]  incident it would be one thing but it isn't again stafford texas 11 year old boy violently
[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:45.080]  attacked after telling classmates he voted for donald trump in the school's mock election
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:52.280]  leaving him having to use crutches another incident out of florida 17 year old student
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:58.600]  punched by a classmate punched by a tolerant liberal excuse me in the face because he was
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:06.040]  holding a donald trump sign during gym class we played the video yesterday of the guy in chicago
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:13.640]  dragged out of his car beaten by a mob of people as they decry the fact that he voted for donald
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:18.120]  trump you voted for trump this is what you're going to get beat him around the head rob his
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:23.800]  possessions his arm gets stuck in the window of the vehicle it drives off dragging him down the
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:30.120]  street can you imagine if the roles were reversed it looked like an actual lynching by the end of
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:34.360]  this sea and you can see the video we're playing it right now can you imagine if the roles were
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:40.760]  reversed can you imagine if a group of aggressive intolerant trump supporters had basically dragged
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.800]  a african-american guy a hillary voter out of his car and sort of beating him around the head
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:51.720]  robbing him and then literally dragging him in the streets hanging off the back of a car that
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:57.480]  would be a nationwide news story it would be all over the place it would be all over cnn the cnn
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:03.960]  report on this no abc news no mvc no nobody's reported on it and it's part of a pattern
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:13.960]  new orleans a famous monument dogged in graffiti that reads die white die again another tolerant
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:19.080]  liberal obviously responsible for that message we've had the death threats flooding twitter
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:24.520]  you can go on twitter at any point type in assassinate trump hundreds of thousands of death
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:31.160]  threats some of them direct death threat from tolerant liberals who for the past three four
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:35.320]  weeks have been saying oh those aggressive intolerant trump supporters they're not going to
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:40.120]  accept the election result they're going to riot they're going to stage violence when it's hillary
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:46.280]  voters now staging violence in the aftermath of them not accepting the election result new york
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:52.280]  post reports assassination threats against trump flood twitter after election shocker you can see
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:58.120]  more in that article and they're basically out there saying oh no don't assassinate trump because
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:04.200]  then mike pence will become president and he's even worse we have to assassinate him too they're
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:09.560]  actually on twitter saying this it's no surprise to us i mean i've been cataloging their threats
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:14.040]  against trump for over a year now i mean that's why he started wearing a bulletproof vest in the
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:20.360]  first place because of all these peaceful tolerant liberals that don't threaten to kill you if you
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:25.960]  disagree with them politically so you've got a national hate crime wave sweeping america and
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:32.920]  isn't it ironic that hillary clinton during the debate in fact it was during that infamous alt
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:40.120]  right speech where she uh directly called out alex jones hillary said that donald trump was the cause
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:47.160]  of bullying in schools well look at what's happening now in the aftermath of this election it's kids
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:54.760]  being bullied being violently bullied in schools because they supported donald trump again everything
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:13:02.600]  they project on us they're responsible for it hateful intolerant violence this is the new
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:09.000]  regressive left there are very few actual real liberals calling them out there are a few and
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:15.560]  we give them honorable mentions when they do it but by no means are there enough so again you've
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:21.240]  got riots across america portland san diego los angeles there'll be more tonight don't worry about
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:28.120]  that george soros and move on org have got this plan to a fine tea again the media is pretending
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:33.240]  it's an organic protest it's not an organic protest they literally have news networks trying to hire
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:39.800]  people to play the role of anti-trump agitators so they can interview them they've got cnn interviewing
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:46.680]  their own camera men and claiming it's an organic anti-trump protester you've got move on org on
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:51.480]  their own website saying this is what we're going to do following these orders busing them in to
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:58.280]  austin we had that article up on info wars dot com and again this trump riot trend is yet another
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:04.680]  example of how the alt left the social justice warriors the regressive left is infinitely
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:10.760]  more dangerous violent and intolerant than the alt right we had an entire election campaign
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:17.000]  of the media demonizing the alt right as this violent bigoted force that's going to stage
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  violence and start attacking people well look who's attacking people it's actually the alt left
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:29.800]  it's your people it's the monsters that you created with all this hysterical media coverage
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:34.120]  for the past year saying that donald trump is literally hitler that he's going to destroy the
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:43.480]  world penny penny the sky is falling you created that and that's why they're now having to frame
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:48.920]  it as some kind of organic natural protest that is legitimate it's not legitimate you had the
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:55.240]  daily beast come out and say oh look at trump he's already showing himself to be anti-free press
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:15:02.440]  anti-freedom of assembly because he decried these protests they're not protests when they're burning
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:09.880]  down shops smashing windows attacking people on the street that's a riot that's criminal behavior
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:17.160]  it's not a protest but again because the leftist media is wedded to these people i mean they
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:21.880]  incited them in the first place the media is responsible for inciting these riots because
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:27.640]  of their hysterical rhetoric about donald trump being a fascist they all believe it
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:33.160]  they've all got moral righteous indignation they're all out on the streets thinking that they're
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:39.880]  actually some kind of anti-fascist revolutionary force like they're fighting against the occupation
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:46.840]  in france by the nazis and the media has done that to this people in fact let's go to that video
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:53.560]  now of the black bloke anarchist who probably is a 25 year old virgin who lived in his mom's
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:16:00.680]  basement and has never had a job smashing an electrical box with what looks like a baseball
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:08.600]  bat let's go to that video now i'll talk over it again this was last night look at him attacking
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:14.600]  an electrical box with dozens of people surrounding him and then one of them sees some sense and tries
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:23.480]  to stop him this woman so then he starts attacking the woman this is the tolerant peaceful loving left
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:30.440]  this is from the trump riot but again you won't see that on cnn they'll call it they'll say it was
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:38.120]  largely peaceful as shops are being smashed in attacking bus stations burning american flags
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:42.520]  attacking people in the street the media will say oh there are a few disturbances but largely
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:49.320]  peaceful largely peaceful legitimate protest no not legitimate they're literally protesting
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:57.640]  against the idea of free democratic elections okay f off to north korea you'll really like it there
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:05.000]  but again this is another example of the violent intolerant left that the media has given legitimacy
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  to over the past year has incited with this hysterical extremist rhetoric about how donald
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.960]  trump is literally hitler and we're gonna have some more videos of that probably in the next
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:22.760]  segment now but what's the end game well now they're out arguing that because hillary clinton
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:29.400]  won the popular vote which isn't even true at this point they haven't counted eight percent of the
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:35.000]  vote which is largely in republican areas so by the end of this when it's all wrapped up
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:40.440]  donald trump could have won the won the popular vote anyway but again that's the mantra this is
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:46.920]  directly from move on org from george soros oh hillary won the popular vote therefore
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:53.400]  we need to put pressure on the electoral college to change the rules of the game after the game
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:18:00.600]  has finished they're literally trying to overturn the results of a free democratic election like
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:08.040]  some third world dictatorship this is out of the new york post the one scenario that could
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:13.160]  still get hillary into the white house for diehard democrats holding out hope that they won't have
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:18.920]  to live through a trump presidency god forbid literally hitler there is a last incredibly
[02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:23.640]  long shot for them to latch on to a surprise twist in the electoral college and it basically
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:29.880]  talks about putting pressure on members of the electoral college to not vote in line with how
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:36.600]  the states voted in the presidential election there are actually tumblr websites petitions
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:42.680]  frothing sjw's everywhere devoted to this they actually think they can overturn the
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:48.520]  results of a democratic election these people are authoritarians okay they wouldn't be out
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:56.920]  of place in venezuela or north korea or communist china that's the spirit that runs through these
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:03.240]  people there you see the meme claim trump is going to destroy america as they go out and
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:10.280]  destroy america again it's all reflection it's all projection what they accuse you of they're
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:15.800]  doing they're planning and they're trying to actually overturn the results of democratic
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:23.320]  election we saw it with brexit don't think this is not a threat okay 17 million people in the united
[02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:29.080]  kingdom a majority in the vote of 52 percent voted for brexit we were told beforehand the
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:34.840]  government will implement your vote look what happened they got lawyers they got political
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:40.280]  class insiders to take it to the high court now it looks like it's going to go to a parliamentary
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:45.400]  vote they're going to vote against it they're going to annul the democratic will of the
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:50.840]  british people or at least attempt to and that's what leftists and social justice warriors
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:56.440]  funded by billionaire elitist george soros are trying to do in the united states we'll get into
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:20:02.120]  after the break this is the alex jones show live stay tuned in these uncertain times it makes sense

[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:27.640]  the language of butthurt losers and criminal thugs we've seen more riots last night we'll see more
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:32.040]  riots tonight and this is the end game this is what michael moore is calling for as well which
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:38.280]  we'll get on to they're trying to argue that because hillary won the popular vote which for
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:42.840]  one they haven't counted eight percent of the results that's not even known yet number two
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:49.880]  she won 47 percent of the vote so the majority of americans who voted did not vote for hillary
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:55.720]  clinton whichever whichever way you want to splice it they're trying to argue that they can go to
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:02.440]  the electoral college and put pressure on these people to overturn the fair and free results
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:09.320]  of a democratic election what does that tell you about these people again would they have
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:14.840]  whined if trump had won the popular vote but hillary had won the election would they have
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:20.280]  complained about that no they wouldn't have said a damn word because they want to change the rules
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:27.320]  of the game after they've already lost the game i mean it's like in american football i mean you
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:33.000]  can't argue that a field goal should have been worth six points after you've already lost the game it
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.800]  doesn't work like that you lost you knew the rules of the game going in you lost accept it move on
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:44.840]  but they're not going to accept it because these people are violent hateful intolerant
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:51.560]  authoritarian thugs controlled from the very top this is not organic this is move on to all
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:59.400]  this is again the so-called anarchists doing the bidding of a billionaire globalist elitist
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:06.680]  in george soros how does that reconcile with them claiming to be anarchists it doesn't if hillary
[02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:11.240]  clinton had won would all these anarchists and communists be out on the streets right now no
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:18.200]  they wouldn't yet she's the ultimate wall street inside the the ultimate embodiment of the political
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:24.520]  class would they have been out on the street protesting her election no way you're not anarchists
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:29.000]  you're not communists i mean you can disagree with those people but if they legitimately have
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:35.160]  those beliefs fair enough whatever but you're not even that you're complete hypocrites and the
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:40.520]  kind of tactics that they employ at this point border on domestic terrorism this is straight
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:47.240]  out the bill airs playbook the weather underground remember larry grass wall infiltrated the
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:50.920]  weather underground said that their ultimate plan for people who don't agree with them
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:57.240]  is to put their ideological opponents in concentration camps and when you talk to
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:02.120]  social justice warriors when you dare to disagree with social justice warriors that's the end game
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:09.080]  of their ideology because they're violent intolerant hateful big ups who want to overturn
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:15.880]  the result of a democratic election by rioting in the streets news flash it's not going to happen
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:22.040]  you win an election by actually not being a lazy ass and working hard for it and getting your message
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:28.200]  out not by throwing temper tantrums and throwing your toys out of the pram in the aftermath
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:37.960]  but again this is what michael most pushing progress outlook the orwellian nature of that name
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:43.320]  they're trying to have the result of a democratic election overturned and they call themselves
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:51.000]  progressives has there ever been anything more orwellian again cancelling the democratic
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.600]  rights of the american people because you're but her and you lost that's not progressive
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:28:03.400]  that's authoritarian you should be ashamed of yourselves as should be anyone that supports this
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:09.880]  oh but what's harry reed saying the outgoing thank god senate minority leader harry reed
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:14.360]  released a scathing statement on friday tearing into president elect donald trump this is out of
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:19.560]  yahu news quote if this is going to be a time of healing we must first put the responsibility
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:24.360]  for healing where it belongs at the feet of donald trump a sexual predator who lost the
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:29.560]  popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate i've heard more stories in the past 48
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:33.800]  hours of americans living in fear of their own government and their fellow americans that i can
[02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:40.840]  remember hearing in five decades in politics well that's strange harry reed because all i've seen
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:49.000]  over the past 48 hours is trump supporters being violently attacked okay the hateful intolerance
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:55.400]  is only coming from one side and it's not donald trump supporters how many videos of people being
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:02.120]  beaten up on the streets do we need to see to realize that so harry reed remember this is
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:07.880]  the same guy who called the bundes terrorists they were all proven innocent harry reed is accusing
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:16.200]  donald trump of unleashing a tide of hate while hillary boaters unleash a tide of hate riot
[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:24.920]  violent brutality against donald trump supporters again it's all about projection they do what they
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:32.600]  accuse you of they embody the very worst aspects of humanity these people make me absolutely sick
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:39.480]  every single time but the good news is they're so lazy and stupid that they think screaming the words
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:44.680]  bigger misogynist and racist are actually going to have give them political success it doesn't
[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:52.360]  you failed you lost we'll be back after this stay tuned we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:56.120]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:05.480]  the nfl is considering some serious changes as ratings continue to plummet some of the changes
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:10.360]  include reducing ads and add time reducing the time of game to perhaps even changing the way
[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:14.840]  it's officiated these were among the things mentioned by nfl commissioner roger godel to increase
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:20.040]  ratings but he failed to mention the protest of our country by some of its players like collin
[02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:26.760]  paperneck erica reed kenny shills jackie tart elizabeth herald and louis erving who have been
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:31.880]  protesting the country during the national anthem which without a doubt is affecting ratings wait the
[02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:35.880]  players in the league are protesting the people in the country who drive the high ratings and the
[02:30:35.880 --> 02:30:41.800]  ratings are dropping shocking but the pc nfl can't address this perhaps the silver lining in all of
[02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:46.360]  this is that people are less inclined to being obsessed with football all day long and have been
[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:51.240]  following the presidential election as well as other local and national issues that they see they
[02:30:51.240 --> 02:31:07.720]  can affect with vigilance and action not just taking a knee this is oan shroyer from info wars.com

[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:45.560]  while but i probably could not have done it without brain force i went home about 6 45 this morning

[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:36.600]  the same rigged media that incited these riots in the first place with their hysterical
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:42.760]  propaganda about donald trump being literally hitler has not only created the conditions to
[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:47.800]  legitimize those riots as they did with ferguson and the whole black lives matter issue they're
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:54.680]  now literally rigging hoaxing media segments to create this narrative that these people have a
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:34:01.080]  legitimate grievance and that hillary clinton should demand that the election result be overturned
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:07.160]  they're actually hoaxing media segments to try and run that scam on live television

[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:30.440]  as we move forward in this battle in this war and the election was only part of the battle
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:37.080]  the battle goes on and it goes on with the rigged media now trying to hoax this narrative
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:42.440]  that hillary clinton has a legitimate grievance that she should be president that they're going
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:48.760]  to try and pressure the electoral college into changing the rules after the game's already finished
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:55.400]  by just handing her the presidency yes it's extremely unlikely but if we allow this narrative
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:37:02.840]  to gain a foothold it's only going to grow like a tumor so this is cnn interviewing a supposedly
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:10.520]  organic authentic anti-trump pro-hillary protester on the streets now listen to this guy and
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:17.720]  specifically listen to the end of the interview when don lemon the host starts talking and admits
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:25.400]  that this so-called organic protester is in fact a cnn employee a camera man let's go to the clip
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:30.680]  so you don't feel like this was a fair election because it looks like Donald Trump won fair and
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:36.200]  square how did he win fair and square hillary had more votes more human beings voted for hillary
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:40.920]  this isn't fair we didn't get one vote you didn't get a vote it's just like back in the day when
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:44.680]  your vote was one third of the electoral college here's somebody who wants to blow that up you
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:49.000]  want to get rid of electoral college just count the votes it's ridiculous hillary you're a lawyer
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:54.920]  walk in go to the supreme court i believe in you hillary i've been to rwanda i've been to your
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:59.960]  hospital in rwanda i've seen all the good you've done i believe in you women need you minorities
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:06.040]  need you i need you chicago need you we all need you this country needs you to stand up and walk into
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:11.640]  the supreme court and say one vote equals one vote what's wrong with that what's the debate
[02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:15.720]  definitely feel his passion there's other people out here who feel the same way don't at one point
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:20.200]  you had people who were locked on this road chicago police moved in everything has remained peaceful
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:24.520]  like i said died as you see thousands of people still continue to gather but like we've heard this
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:28.200]  man very passionate about the idea he doesn't want to kill her he's not yeah ryan you know i used to
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:32.840]  live there and i know that guy that's john gerkeve actually went to africa with me as a cameraman
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:37.640]  but anyway that's another story all right thank you john thank you very much right there you have it
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:45.000]  there you have it rigged media trying to create a hoax and you know he kind of over egged it didn't
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:51.320]  he i mean let's be honest he kind of gave it a bit too much when he was playing that role of this
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:58.120]  irate anti trump agitator as he heard don lemon i know that guy oh he's that cameraman oh really
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:04.440]  so we looked him up online and a resume for john gerkevich who is the guy named the so-called
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:09.960]  irate anti-trump protester and what we found correlates with lemon statements about a cameraman
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:17.080]  working for cnn and filming in third world third world nation so it is him they got a cnn employee
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:24.040]  to play the role of an anti-trump agitator to drop this narrative this bot hurt whiny crybaby
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:30.040]  narrative that they want to change the rules of the game after they've lost the game again they
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:34.040]  want to pretend they want to argue that a field goal should have been worth six points after
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:39.480]  they already got crushed well it isn't worth six points sorry you can't just invent new rules
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:46.360]  after the game's over get over it you lost but they're going to try and continue this narrative
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:53.800]  and michael moore is firmly on board the complete hypocrite who in june 2016 said he was voting for
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:40:00.360]  bernie sanders because hillary clinton was the corrupt iraq war voting wall street corporate
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:05.240]  establishment candidate who he would never vote for lo and behold four months later oh hillary
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:11.480]  clinton's great everybody should go out and vote for her now filmmaker michael moore this is up on
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:17.400]  rt filmmaker michael moore has become a political beacon for devastated hillary clinton plans to
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:25.320]  move on and get sh it done after posting a five point plan which went viral and i mean it got 400
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:32.840]  000 facebook likes 880 000 shares he then pointed another one posted another one which i put up on
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:39.240]  my twitter and he directly calls for people to follow the orders of move on dot org which is
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:46.440]  owned by george soros so this is a guy who cut his teeth going after big business going after the
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:52.680]  corrupt establishment supposedly in the name of defending the rights of the middle class now he's
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:41:01.880]  openly telling people to obey george soros a billionaire globalist elitist who specializes
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:09.160]  in overthrowing legitimately elected governments around the world and look what we have with
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.320]  this narrative oh hillary won the popular vote even though the popular vote isn't even been counted yet
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:18.360]  yet she should just change the rules and march right into the oval office because that's not
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:24.600]  what third world dictators do at all is it but michael moore the tolerant liberal the socialist
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:30.040]  that's what he's pushing he's telling people follow the orders of george soros and move on
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:35.880]  dot org get out on the streets with these violent bigoted hateful intolerant goons
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:40.040]  and start smashing crap up because you didn't get your own way
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:46.440]  this is a narrative they're going to move forward with here's another one gateway pundit reports
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:53.080]  far left group answer coalition plans massive demonstration unrest during trump inauguration
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:58.280]  of course in january the post election demonstrations against trump are being
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:04.680]  orchestrated by socialist and marxists that's why they're so violent answer coalition a socialist
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:09.960]  group is planning mass protests in washington dc during donald trump's inauguration the
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:16.520]  group claims to be an anti-war group but has remained silent during the obama years as he
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:22.600]  drone bombed country after country across the muslim world when a democrat's doing that
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:29.720]  those bombs are peaceful you can massacre muslims across the world as long as it's a
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:35.880]  humanitarian war then it's perfectly okay when george w bush does it then it's horrible war crime
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:42.120]  obama does it hillary clinton does it literally destroys government creates an international
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:48.760]  migrant crisis creates isis arms them they haven't got a damn thing to say about it answer coalition
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:55.480]  give me a break the far left group announced the protest on wednesday progressive people
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:01.480]  yeah progressive people who want to cancel democratic elections that's really progressive
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:06.920]  isn't it progressive people from all over the country will be descending on washington dc on
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:12.520]  january 20th to stage a massive demonstration along pennsylvania avenue on inauguration day
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:17.800]  so you've got answer pushing it you've got george soros's move on dot org pushing it
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:23.320]  you've got cnn pushing it these fake rigged hoax interviews with their own camera men
[02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:30.040]  you've got michael more pushing it this is the narrative going forward and they'll continue to
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:35.720]  get more violent if we don't get out ahead of this narrative right now and discredit it
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:39.880]  like we did to a large extent with the black lives matter which was again the same thing
[02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:47.880]  george soros funded from the top astro turf fake movement not authentic not grass roots
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:57.640]  again it's all part of this weatherman bill ares method they want to overturn the entire system
[02:43:57.640 --> 02:44:03.880]  their solution their utopia is going to look worse than anything you could ever imagine
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:10.200]  these people hate capitalism they hate the middle class their complete losers in their own
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:15.640]  personal lives they've got nothing to live for nothing to strive for self-entitled
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:23.960]  whiny butthurt losers who don't want a job don't want to get ahead in life and their control freaks
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:31.000]  at heart they're authoritarians that's why they lost after controlling your life i mean who who
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:37.400]  has even got the time to interfere with everybody's life to the extent that they do with their safe
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:43.960]  spaces and their trigger warnings and they're being permanently offended for everything these people
[02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:49.720]  at heart are control freaks and they won't give up the reins of power very easily so that's why
[02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:56.040]  we need to stand the front foot with this these riots are only going to continue unless we get
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:01.800]  ahead of this narrative and again you've seen redcom revolutionary communist party
[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:08.840]  organizing these riots the black bloc anarchists the 25 year old unemployed virgins living in
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:15.480]  their mom's basement decrying the system while doing nothing about it smoking weed all day
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:21.320]  i mean they don't they're barely even engaging hashtag activism anymore they're that lazy
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:27.480]  and it's like as stefan mollin you said you know fdr won the election because of radio
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:33.080]  jfk won the election the presidency because of television donald trump won the presidency because
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:39.000]  of social media in fact you even had the daily beast yesterday saying that myself alex jones
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:46.440]  mike sernovich chuck johnson mollin you we were all to a great deal responsible in terms of social
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:54.440]  media for helping trump win the presidency because we actually work hard we care we strive to win
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:46:00.600]  you don't lay around being butthurt whiny self-entitled losers who are too lazy to do it in the
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:06.520]  moment and then when they fail they go out and smash crap up that's not how it works that's not
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:14.440]  how you get ahead in life okay again assassination threats flooding twitter ron paul has come out
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:20.680]  this is up on infowalls.com this is what i said a couple of days ago as well ron paul trump needs
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:26.440]  to resist neo cons and shadow government elites he said unfortunately there's been several neo
[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:31.160]  conservatives that are getting closer to trump and if he gets his advice from them then i do not
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:37.240]  think that this is a good sign and again this is going to be one of the problems with trump now
[02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:42.600]  there have been a lot of good noises about him filling his cabinet and the other positions with
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:47.720]  people outside of the establishment system and obviously that says you would expect given that
[02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:52.760]  he's run his entire campaign on that you know getting people like kelly an conway in there and
[02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:57.560]  others people who've helped him out throughout the campaign but i mean there are so many positions
[02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:03.240]  to fill what is it four thousand five hundred positions for starters alone now obviously he's
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:08.840]  going to get some people in there who might not have his best interests at heart so that's what
[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:14.760]  we've got to look out for that's what we've got to call him out on because even though the media
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:20.520]  said oh trump's just a demagogue well when we're not going to act like those people in north korea
[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:27.400]  fake crying when kim jong il died okay if trump makes mistakes or he doesn't do what he said he's
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:32.520]  gonna do we're gonna hold his feet to the fire and that goes for who he appoints in his cabinet
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:37.640]  and in this interview ron paul went on to say we look at the president we look at what he said
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:42.840]  we look at what he might do when you look at his advisors but quite frankly there's an outside
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:48.440]  source which would we refer to as the deep state or the shadow government there's a lot of influence
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:52.840]  by people which are actually more powerful than our government itself our president
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:48:00.280]  he went on to touch on foreign policy and he said basically quote during the campaign he did talk
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:05.240]  a little bit about backing off and being less confrontational with russia and i like that
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:08.920]  yeah that's pretty good that we're not going to have world war three right like we would have done
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:13.480]  with hillary he criticized some of the wars in the middle east at the same time he believes
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:17.320]  we should accelerate the war against isis and terrorism without showing he has an understanding
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:22.280]  of what causes terrorism well the problem with that is while claiming that they were at war with
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:29.480]  isis hillary clinton's state department was literally hiring gods for ben gazi who were al-qaeda
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:38.040]  members right before isis came to prominence they then armed isis and then refused to bomb them i mean
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:43.080]  you saw them dropping the leaflets claiming that it was environmental concerns with the reason why
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:49.000]  they were giving isis members warnings to get out of the area before they bombed the oil tankers
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:54.600]  so obama hasn't even been bombing isis i mean the russians came in and basically wiped them out
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:49:02.200]  back last year but again this is interesting this is what ron paul said today quote sometimes the
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:07.400]  false flags and the unintended consequences are beyond the control of even a sincere president
[02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:13.560]  that would prefer that not to happen so ron paul's raising the potential of false flags that could
[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:21.240]  get us get america at least into another haphazard foreign military adventure so we've got to watch
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:28.440]  out for that we've got to watch out for who donald trump hires for his cabinet we got this story
[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:35.000]  out of louder with crowder tolerant grubhub ceo tells trump supporting employees they're hateful
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:44.520]  racists and this was the ceo matt maloney of this company called grubhub who said if you do not agree
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:50.920]  with this statement which was basically a sjw screed about everyone's a racist if you don't
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:55.160]  agree with me if you don't agree with this statement then please reply to this email with
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:50:01.400]  your resignation because you have no place here more liberal tolerance so anybody basically
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:06.120]  who voted for donald trump anyone who agrees with anything that donald trump stands for
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:12.760]  he basically told them to resign from his company because he's a tolerant liberal and
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:17.240]  he can tolerate diversity of opinion oh no he actually can't he just told everyone to resign
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:24.280]  who disagrees with him and what was the response well there was a complete backlash calls to boycott
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:32.120]  grubhub which everybody should do boycott grubhub and what happened this doc tanked down four to five
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:38.760]  percent because lo and behold intolerant hateful bigots aren't that popular anymore and you can
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:46.200]  hide behind your misogyny claims and your racist claims and your fake phony tolerance it doesn't
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:52.520]  work anymore people see right through you boycott grubhub another company that's going down we will

[03:00:05.800 --> 03:00:12.360]  trump protest we're not even 24 hours into his president elect candidacy and this is their reaction
[03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:17.720]  they attack trump as a racist the misogynist the rapist but do they actually know the facts
[03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:23.400]  what's your opinion of trump being elected president i'm uh really sad and disappointed
[03:00:23.400 --> 03:00:29.080]  why is that because i think he's a terrible person who doesn't deserve to be the face of
[03:00:29.080 --> 03:00:35.880]  united states why is he a terrible person well he's a he's been accused of uh sexually assaulting
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:43.640]  several women uh he's also racist and quite clearly sexist possibly homophobic okay all right
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:51.720]  hillary was also uh under nypd investigation according to eric prince of blackwater and she
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:57.640]  was found to have visited jeffrey epstein's pedophile island six times uh so she is under
[03:00:57.640 --> 03:01:04.040]  investigation i don't think several women have specifically come out and said this person sexually
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:10.440]  assaulted me about hillary clinton right yeah they have it it's under investigation right as is
[03:01:10.440 --> 03:01:15.480]  done from i'm gonna okay what about the racism what about the racism yeah how do you explain the
[03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:22.840]  racism he's endorsed by the kkk like okay he's endorsed by the kkk like this is my god you realize
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:30.600]  hillary clinton's mentor was robber bird is that just a joke that's just a joke to you is what a joke
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:35.880]  today our country has lost a true american original my friend and mentor robert seabird
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:42.520]  senator bird was a man of surpassing eloquence and nobility there are a lot of people who wrote
[03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:49.560]  these eulogies for senator bird in the newspapers and i read a bunch of them and they mentioned that
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:54.440]  he once had a fleeting association with a clued clutch clan and what does that mean i'll tell
[03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:58.760]  you what it means he was a country boy from the hills and the hollows of west virginia he was
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:05.080]  trying to get elected and maybe he did something he shouldn't have done and he spent the rest of his
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:12.440]  life making it up i don't understand why you asked if that's a joke well if trump is a racist why isn't
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:20.360]  hillary clinton racist is kkk endorsing hillary the clan was her mentor why is it so funny all
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:25.320]  right so why did you come up here to the protest uh i was walking to class i saw i was when it was
[03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:34.760]  smaller here and then uh when i came back see that brings everyone together obviously it's
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:43.560]  it's a very very big uh pro hillary anti anti-trump rally earlier you mentioned the people with mask
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:48.280]  do you know who those people are uh from what i can tell they're wearing kefias which uh generally
[03:02:48.280 --> 03:02:52.840]  come from the middle east there are a lot of palestinian supporters wear them because that's
[03:02:52.840 --> 03:02:57.400]  like one of their it's actually what if i told you it's the local communist party oh i knew i knew
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:03.240]  it was uh because i mean the the pro palestinian group here on campus is very very communist i know
[03:03:03.240 --> 03:03:08.200]  i know a few people from classes that are involved i think we can come together now don't
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:13.160]  ever say make america great again i think we can do that and this is this is going to take
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:19.480]  involve everyone across the entire political spectrum left right communist uh conservative
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:27.160]  everyone is going to have to work together to make this country's great again in fact the majority
[03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:38.520]  of them actually believe they're going to be immediately deported because he does not represent
[03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:47.720]  this country his racist xenophobic and really utter where are you from my friend i am from
[03:03:47.720 --> 03:03:55.320]  houston okay this year great i am in muslim america yes sir i am in muslim america i do not deserve
[03:03:55.320 --> 03:04:01.320]  how do you roam out of this country what about what of course you know exactly personal freedom of
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:08.600]  religion yes sir i'm not believing in some respects now he believes all of my kind are terrorists are
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:16.040]  radical islamists when very few of us are what's the first thing that comes to mind he's gonna
[03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:21.960]  deport illegal immigrants who will help this country and why supremacy
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:32.760]  a local communist party that i spoke to here in austin wouldn't speak back because they don't believe
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:38.520]  in free speech and frankly they're cowards this entire march was a march of cowardice
[03:04:38.520 --> 03:04:44.840]  as obama your leader has explained to you you must accept this peaceful transfer of power
[03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:50.280]  and accept the resurrection of u.s constitution and the bill of rights of which this country was
[03:04:50.280 --> 03:05:03.000]  founded on john bound for info wars dot com three days after the election of donald trump and the
[03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:07.800]  reality of a trump presidency is starting to hit home for some people this is such a devastating
[03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:12.840]  notion that they need to call an ambulance or even want to die well we trump voters care about our
[03:05:12.840 --> 03:05:17.960]  fellow americans and we're pained by this so let's help the trump protesters let's try to help them
[03:05:17.960 --> 03:05:23.000]  recover from their devastation if you see a trump protester or a group of them give them a diaper hand
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:27.800]  them a binky cover them in a blankie after all this is what you do for crying babies many of these
[03:05:27.800 --> 03:05:32.840]  people look like they need a hug so give them a box of huggies we trump voters can't stand to see
[03:05:32.840 --> 03:05:37.800]  our fellow americans so depleted so we will make sure to get as many of them a warm bottle of milk
[03:05:37.800 --> 03:05:42.680]  as possible to make america great again we must make sure that these babies are taken care of with
[03:05:42.680 --> 03:05:48.440]  plenty of diapers vinkies and rattles don't worry trump protesters remember we're stronger together

[03:08:38.360 --> 03:08:49.800]  will bring them down and restore our republic the internet is what killed the new world order
[03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:56.200]  globalist establishment and is why their program of tyranny is declining in russia europe the united
[03:08:56.200 --> 03:09:02.040]  kingdom with briggs and now with shocking results supposedly to them here in the united states
[03:09:03.640 --> 03:09:12.520]  the internet coupled with delusion this marriage this congress is what brought us to this point
[03:09:12.520 --> 03:09:20.520]  think about it the internet already is hundreds and hundreds of times bigger than all the entertainment
[03:09:20.520 --> 03:09:25.560]  news combined on broadcast and cable transmitted and satellite tv's i mean there's hundreds and
[03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:30.600]  hundreds and hundreds of times the traffic and the political traffic on the internet is
[03:09:31.720 --> 03:09:37.160]  50 a hundred times i don't know it's it's just so huge they just corrected me that it wasn't
[03:09:37.160 --> 03:09:42.840]  60 million earlier they went and did the numbers i guess i hadn't checked since this morning 100
[03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:48.920]  million not counting terrestrial radio that we have three and a half million rated when the
[03:09:48.920 --> 03:09:56.520]  ratings come in from our affiliates but our internet success is so big that we just got
[03:09:56.520 --> 03:10:01.320]  like 60 more affiliates the last few months so we're over 230 right now and it's not about
[03:10:01.320 --> 03:10:08.360]  inforce bragging if this ragtag operation is kicking the entire cable news system's ass up
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:13.480]  and down the road when they're spending billions of dollars in the aggregate and have all these
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:19.000]  beauty queen tarts up there spreading their legs you can't cover up this fraud with a little bit of
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:25.400]  sugar so having bimbos on there it'd mean we're swallowing the cyanide and when i talk about
[03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:33.720]  the hubris the delusion of the delusionites they've known for years that not just info wars but a
[03:10:33.720 --> 03:10:39.560]  constellation of liberty sites like drudgereport.com and others dwarf them already and it isn't just
[03:10:39.560 --> 03:10:45.640]  info wars that exploded the last few months drudges now not just bigger than facebook and
[03:10:45.640 --> 03:10:52.440]  twitter and and all this and the new york times combined it's bigger than like the entire mainstream
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:59.000]  media just in traffic it's two people running so think about that this is how pathetic these people
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:03.400]  are and we have to celebrate the fact that they're pathetic and they're known traders and their jokes
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:07.560]  because they're all scared up they're going the pollsters actually weren't wrong and we don't lie
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:11.960]  to you and we have a big audience and we love you here here's the one with big breasts show your legs
[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:18.680]  baby paul ryan likes you he he doesn't want your guns or open borders and he didn't say you couldn't
[03:11:18.680 --> 03:11:24.120]  nominate trump he he didn't say that there wasn't any free elections they're hoping you go back to
[03:11:24.120 --> 03:11:30.440]  sleep but you're not asleep so the big secret is they're still up there wondering why they have no
[03:11:30.440 --> 03:11:34.600]  ratings wonder why they're going bankrupt wonder why they're all shrinking wonder why the new york
[03:11:34.600 --> 03:11:40.440]  times is collapsing and they still don't get it they have no audience and just because they have
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:46.680]  the fanciest suits and the biggest teleprompters doesn't mean anybody takes what they say seriously
[03:11:46.680 --> 03:11:54.040]  and no one's even tuning into them to go back and regurgitate their talking points out i go to forums
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:57.640]  that don't even deal with politics and everybody gets exactly what's happening i walk down the
[03:11:57.640 --> 03:12:00.920]  street people get it now sure about a third of the public can't tie their shoelaces and they're
[03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:07.960]  long gone you know george soros control but a large group of people a majority now are awake
[03:12:07.960 --> 03:12:12.040]  and here's what's scary to the establishment they're getting awake a lot faster so barring
[03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:16.840]  launching a big war barring a total stock market collapse which we're already headed towards barring
[03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:21.880]  societal breakdown they're not going to be able to organize and keep their selves in power and even
[03:12:21.880 --> 03:12:29.880]  a societal breakdown will only blow up in their face there's nothing they can do elites always
[03:12:29.880 --> 03:12:33.800]  believe they're invincible they always believe they're unstoppable so you have the big jewel
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:40.440]  the internet and their own delusion instead of admitting they've lied in the last decade as it
[03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:46.360]  as as their credibility collapsed they began to double and triple down making fun of us laughing
[03:12:46.360 --> 03:12:51.080]  at us saying we're pathetic saying we wear tinfoil hats that's all they've got is this carnival
[03:12:51.080 --> 03:12:58.360]  barker scam to act like we're the ones with no credibility and he's that alex jones that not
[03:12:58.360 --> 03:13:06.680]  on the internet's i am so proud we're self-made in a market of ideas coming from local radio
[03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:14.840]  and access tv 21 years ago i like my grassroots bona fides but you're all from trashy families
[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:20.360]  social climbers who went and sold yourselves out to the elite i go study most of these talk show
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:25.080]  hosts and most of these movie people and most of these politicos and man they come from families
[03:13:25.080 --> 03:13:30.440]  where their dad was a con artist and their mom was involved in weird stuff and and and nothing bad
[03:13:30.440 --> 03:13:36.840]  about this but but failures and swindles and scams and they just the elite went and found a bunch of
[03:13:36.840 --> 03:13:41.000]  trash most of the people out here aren't trash you come from a family of plumbers they're good
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:46.680]  honorable hard-working folks you're good people you put them in power they do a great job ranchers
[03:13:47.400 --> 03:13:51.800]  police officers whatever the case is but you look at the political class there all these want to be
[03:13:51.800 --> 03:14:00.280]  nouveau riche trash who are sociopathic narcissistic empty totally dishonorable so they were typecast
[03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:07.160]  and picked to be the cacophony of parrots to sit up there repeating the same thing over and over
[03:14:07.160 --> 03:14:12.600]  again so we would all feel like we were alone when we thought well i thought tax cuts helped or i
[03:14:12.600 --> 03:14:16.840]  thought family was okay or i thought guns were all right result defender gee they just don't seem to
[03:14:16.840 --> 03:14:21.960]  get that good people defend themselves of course they get it they're a ruling class of filth trying
[03:14:21.960 --> 03:14:30.040]  to capture the greatest nation on earth and then i realized good people never brag about their families
[03:14:31.240 --> 03:14:35.720]  good people don't ever just think what good folks they come from or what their ancestors did or they
[03:14:35.720 --> 03:14:40.040]  don't even go look into it and then i went looked into my family and all the things they did i mean
[03:14:40.040 --> 03:14:44.200]  i don't go back to the founding of the country of the mayflower texas independence i mean at the
[03:14:44.200 --> 03:14:49.720]  detonator level of it with andrew jackson i mean my family was detonator level on my mom's side
[03:14:49.720 --> 03:14:54.760]  complete absolute detonator original funding everything and you bet it was a covert operation
[03:14:54.760 --> 03:14:59.240]  you better believe it and then it goes right through to my grandfather connection world war
[03:14:59.240 --> 03:15:04.200]  two and runs as a republican for desegregation and then works with eisenhower and his little
[03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:09.080]  county and has the clan come after him so i can be called clan today by a bunch of racist
[03:15:09.080 --> 03:15:15.720]  mexicans with mexican flags like jackass this i mean i just realized of course i'm fighting tyranny
[03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:21.000]  of course i'm not out to screw people of course i'm not trash and trump's the same you don't start
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:27.080]  a fight with trump you don't get one he's for prosperity he does hard you know deals but he
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:33.480]  does want to bring back this republic and that's why that swamp of trash and filth and scum are
[03:15:33.480 --> 03:15:39.880]  coming after him and if he thinks megan kelly and little twinkle eyes uh paul ryan aren't going to
[03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:45.080]  stab him in the back when they're trying to act friendly now he's crazy they're just holding back
[03:15:45.080 --> 03:15:51.720]  because at a metaphysical level they come from filth you look them up they come from trash and
[03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:59.080]  they inherently have an instinct of trash because they are trash and to them the jewel of america
[03:15:59.080 --> 03:16:07.960]  and hijacking it and raping it and destroying it attracts them george soros the soddies the
[03:16:07.960 --> 03:16:14.280]  communist chinese leaders these are bad people they have to be recognized as who they are wanting
[03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:19.640]  to conquer greater men and women so now you've seen the big secret you already knew it you know i'm
[03:16:19.640 --> 03:16:23.800]  telling you the truth it's the internet it's bigger it's there it's the people we've broken with
[03:16:23.800 --> 03:16:28.200]  mainstream news we don't buy a word they say they can't ever put it back in the bottle again
[03:16:28.200 --> 03:16:32.360]  we're going back to basic americana and what worked in free market not something like they're
[03:16:32.360 --> 03:16:35.640]  saying they don't know where they're going or where they're doing yes they do they've rediscovered
[03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:39.800]  liberty we've rediscovered it we've promoted it ron paul's promoted it countless others have
[03:16:39.800 --> 03:16:46.520]  promoted it and so now we're selling what works what feels good what's honorable what's true what's
[03:16:46.520 --> 03:16:52.760]  historical what our forebears did and it's spiritually metaphysically clicking in all of us
[03:16:52.760 --> 03:17:01.480]  as the spirit of america comes back from the dead that we do the hanging we run the show we
[03:17:01.480 --> 03:17:07.880]  build the ships we fought the wars we planted the crops we took care of the kids we went in the
[03:17:07.880 --> 03:17:15.560]  minds not you you've taken this country and pissed all over it and now in your arrogance you still
[03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:20.200]  think you can con us even though we've already beaten you so many times despite the fact you
[03:17:20.200 --> 03:17:25.240]  rigged the whole thing and had countless funny money from your foreign fellow reserve but in that
[03:17:25.240 --> 03:17:31.640]  crown are a few other jewels they're arrogance they're delusion the internet's the big stone
[03:17:33.640 --> 03:17:37.880]  there's so many other facets to it and i think you can all recognize what the other reasons
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:43.240]  trump won people waking up worldwide the globalist excesses being so arrogant they appoint presidents
[03:17:43.240 --> 03:17:47.160]  in europe and bankrupt countries no really i mean what are other jewels in the crown that
[03:17:47.160 --> 03:17:52.680]  brought trump in his stamina his courage his will the people supporting him uh the nigel
[03:17:52.680 --> 03:18:00.280]  ferrage whistleblowers uh the rise of the new media in this internet system and the vacuum the
[03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:07.080]  media created by standing down and being so evil the truth is history's happening but
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:13.400]  we've retaken a beachhead we're winning the overall war but now we have to drain the swamp
[03:18:13.400 --> 03:18:17.960]  and we cannot sit here and just roll over now to these people because they are scum they are
[03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:22.760]  trash they must be prosecuted justice must be done they wanted to shut down the internet shut
[03:18:22.760 --> 03:18:28.360]  off talk radio go after peaceful people persecute the media obama sits there all arrogant like he's
[03:18:28.360 --> 03:18:32.680]  this big humanitarian when the border is wide open our country's collapsing and the health
[03:18:32.680 --> 03:18:38.360]  departments are going under and our he's on vacation five months out of the year it's time
[03:18:38.360 --> 03:18:44.360]  to fully it's kind of you eat some poison food you vomit part of it up you you feel a little
[03:18:44.360 --> 03:18:49.080]  better but you need to get it all out we've got about a third the vomit out third the poison we
[03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:54.840]  know there's more poison we got to get it out we got to drink some fresh water but in closing
[03:18:54.840 --> 03:19:00.120]  sitting here thinking i mentioned the jewel and the crown and the other stones that accompany it
[03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:09.240]  but i didn't didn't mention the overall plan and the and this crown of idiocy that was placed
[03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:17.240]  upon these these traders heads and that's god god moving through time moving through history

[03:25:18.760 --> 03:25:25.880]  excuses from the anti-trump movement and from the hillary clinton campaign now although this
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:31.640]  hasn't really come out of the hillary clinton campaign in this year there are people protesting
[03:25:31.640 --> 03:25:38.600]  for the electoral college to elect hillary clinton millions signed petition urging electoral
[03:25:38.600 --> 03:25:43.720]  college to elect hillary clinton the strange thing about this is before i get into this
[03:25:43.720 --> 03:25:48.680]  petition i actually follow a lot of these petitions there's some sites that do these petitions change
[03:25:48.680 --> 03:25:53.720]  dot org is the one that launched this one but even the federal government has websites where
[03:25:53.720 --> 03:25:59.800]  there's petitions where you can petition the president and for whatever reason the petitions
[03:25:59.800 --> 03:26:06.200]  that um that people like i people like myself would back to people at info wars dot com would
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:10.520]  back to people like our audience would back for whatever reason we never seem to get these things
[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:16.200]  off the ground and most of these petitions like there was a petition i think to impeach obama
[03:26:16.200 --> 03:26:23.240]  needed like 200 000 signatures we didn't even get that in a in a month span so i'm just curious
[03:26:23.240 --> 03:26:28.360]  how that happens when we are the most engaged people we are the most active and i thought to
[03:26:28.360 --> 03:26:35.080]  myself maybe i need to dedicate myself to coming in here every monday and telling you what the
[03:26:35.080 --> 03:26:40.520]  petitions are that we need to sign so here's another one is this the one from we are is this
[03:26:40.520 --> 03:26:44.360]  one from change dot org guys is this the yeah so this is the petition that we're looking at
[03:26:45.480 --> 03:26:50.040]  now the story that i have here this came from yahoo one of the biggest anti-trump
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:55.880]  mainstream media outlets going more than 2.4 million people had signed a petition to the
[03:26:55.880 --> 03:27:02.120]  us electoral college urging its members to ignore their state's votes votes and cast their ballots
[03:27:02.120 --> 03:27:07.320]  for the former secretary of state hillary clinton so that's nice that's nice these people
[03:27:07.880 --> 03:27:14.600]  they want you to they're going to sign a petition to commit treason against this country how do you
[03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:18.920]  like that folks that's what you get from the hillary clinton people they just openly want to
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:22.840]  be treasonous against this country and then actually put in a treasonous president but that's
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:27.400]  that's a whole nother issue that they couldn't understand and again i just asked myself why
[03:27:27.400 --> 03:27:32.120]  don't our petitions get millions why can't the petitions against obama's war crimes and lies get
[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:36.200]  millions they're there almost every day i see these things they get almost hundreds of thousands
[03:27:36.200 --> 03:27:41.160]  of signatures but not 2.4 million so that's that's really strange especially when we've
[03:27:42.120 --> 03:27:45.960]  been talking about this alex has talked about this paul joseph watson talked about this
[03:27:45.960 --> 03:27:50.440]  it was social media it was the internet that launched trump to the platform he's at
[03:27:50.440 --> 03:27:55.080]  so i'm not sure what the dynamic is there why this petition gets so many signatures but then
[03:27:55.080 --> 03:28:00.360]  conservative petitions against the liberal establishment don't but look at this this is
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:05.240]  from elijah burg who launched the petition this guy i'd like to have a word with him
[03:28:05.960 --> 03:28:12.440]  mr trump is unfit to serve but clinton is his scapegoating of so many americans it's clinton
[03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:20.120]  that said we were deplorable and she also excuse me he also says that trump is a danger to the
[03:28:20.120 --> 03:28:25.560]  republic no that's clinton so again these people live in a complete reverse reality
[03:28:26.600 --> 03:28:30.600]  but it goes on now i mentioned that we're not hearing anything much out of this from the clinton
[03:28:30.600 --> 03:28:36.360]  camp but she has talked about this before hillary clinton when she was first lady called for the
[03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:41.800]  college to be disbanded the electoral college to be disbanded so that no one would ever have to
[03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:47.320]  doubt again whether his or her vote counted oh right because hillary clinton is the candidate
[03:28:47.320 --> 03:28:52.760]  for voter integrity i'm sorry i forgot it wasn't that there were dead voters voting in this election
[03:28:52.760 --> 03:28:58.200]  oh wait it was it wasn't that there were illegal immigrants voting in this election oh wait it was
[03:28:58.200 --> 03:29:04.920]  and it was the obama administration that greased the skids for this to happen even promoted it folks
[03:29:04.920 --> 03:29:10.200]  i mean let's be perfectly honest the man was promoting illegals to vote and of course the
[03:29:10.200 --> 03:29:16.280]  administration was looking to fast track amnesty to get these people to vote and i'll tell you this
[03:29:16.280 --> 03:29:22.360]  these people can sit here and cry over the fact that hillary clinton i guess allegedly won the
[03:29:23.480 --> 03:29:28.200]  popular vote but i'm not buying it i think that they rigged it and that's why she won the popular
[03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:34.120]  vote but i'll tell you what i was people are asking me what should we do about the electoral
[03:29:34.120 --> 03:29:38.200]  college you like it do you not like it at first i wasn't sure but then after this election i like
[03:29:38.200 --> 03:29:43.560]  the electoral college because you know what i don't want all the dumbasses in california deciding
[03:29:43.560 --> 03:29:48.760]  who my president is going to be every four years hell no we've got more from alex jones coming back
[03:29:48.760 --> 03:29:55.320]  on the other side we're going to drain that swamp the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[03:29:55.320 --> 03:30:04.920]  network the nfl is considering some serious changes as ratings continue to plummet some of the
[03:30:04.920 --> 03:30:10.200]  changes include reducing ads and ad time reducing the time of game to perhaps even changing the way
[03:30:10.200 --> 03:30:14.280]  it's officiated these were among the things mentioned by nfl commissioner roger godel to
[03:30:14.280 --> 03:30:19.240]  increase ratings but he failed to mention the protest of our country by some of his players
[03:30:19.240 --> 03:30:26.280]  like collin paperneck erica reid kenny shills jackie tart elizabeth herald and luce erving who
[03:30:26.280 --> 03:30:30.360]  have been protesting the country during the national anthem which without a doubt is affecting
[03:30:30.360 --> 03:30:34.920]  ratings wait the players in the league are protesting the people in the country who drive the high
[03:30:34.920 --> 03:30:40.520]  ratings and the ratings are dropping shocking but the pc nfl can't address this perhaps the
[03:30:40.520 --> 03:30:44.920]  silver lining in all of this is that people are less inclined to being obsessed with football all
[03:30:44.920 --> 03:30:49.560]  day long and have been following the presidential election as well as other local and national

[03:33:43.160 --> 03:33:50.600]  told by msn that we should just relax now and be happy and enjoy our big victory uh because wow
[03:33:50.600 --> 03:33:56.680]  the system's been repudiated donald j trump elected 45th president of the united states of america
[03:33:56.680 --> 03:34:01.720]  ladies and gentlemen this has been an amazing victory but it's only a beachhead in retaking
[03:34:01.720 --> 03:34:07.880]  this country to make america great again we must retake the nation we have criminal enterprises
[03:34:07.880 --> 03:34:15.080]  multinational corporations crony insider combines in this rig system so donald trump has gotten
[03:34:15.080 --> 03:34:20.840]  control of the swamp but he's got to put the equipment in the swamp now and he has to blow
[03:34:20.840 --> 03:34:28.680]  the dam and drain the swamp out into the ocean of history it is time to drain the swamp in
[03:34:28.680 --> 03:34:35.560]  washington dc and to do that he has to remove paul ryan and he's got the clout to go in and
[03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:39.880]  have the republicans enforce the vote and do it paul ryan stabbed him in the back over and over
[03:34:39.880 --> 03:34:44.680]  again paul ryan wouldn't give him the money that trump raised under law paul ryan told everybody
[03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:48.760]  he's gonna lose the house he's gonna lose the senate they picked up seats more than they thought
[03:34:49.400 --> 03:34:55.080]  they told you he could never get the nomination they told you fox news and the republican sickening
[03:34:55.080 --> 03:34:59.800]  establishment they've removed hillary now it's the republicans and the democrats in congress
[03:34:59.800 --> 03:35:04.600]  they told us that he could never have the nomination even if he had three times as many delegates
[03:35:04.600 --> 03:35:11.160]  it was the party that decided why they were the enlightened anointed george will called it sovereigns
[03:35:11.160 --> 03:35:18.040]  of the party the royalty like the hereditary dictators in england from transylvania and
[03:35:18.040 --> 03:35:24.040]  i'm german or kim jong-un of north korea a third generation hereditary dictator but don't tell that
[03:35:24.040 --> 03:35:29.880]  to all the dumbass young college kids brainwashed at state schools that communism isn't some type
[03:35:29.880 --> 03:35:35.640]  of wonderful heaven now that said if we want to make america great again we've got to make it free
[03:35:35.640 --> 03:35:40.600]  again and to do that we've got to get the agenda of cutting taxes for people under 40 000 a year
[03:35:40.600 --> 03:35:46.280]  to basically zero trump's doing that wonderful cutting the corporate tax so it brings the money
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:50.760]  back to the us we have the highest in the world and a lot of those other basic issues not letting
[03:35:50.760 --> 03:35:58.120]  people just undocumented flood in with cholera and uh stuff like lepacy that's been gone for over
[03:35:58.120 --> 03:36:04.200]  100 years in this country at record levels admit the the cdc admits health departments are collapsing
[03:36:04.200 --> 03:36:11.960]  everywhere we have to secure the borders we have to secure our currency we have to cut taxes and
[03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:16.840]  free spending so we can start paying down the debt and get us back online to bring the world's greatest
[03:36:16.840 --> 03:36:23.800]  creditor nation and if from is going to do that he can't work with harry reid and nancy polosi
[03:36:23.800 --> 03:36:28.840]  and all these other people who are going to stab him in the back in a minute if he thinks paul ryan
[03:36:28.840 --> 03:36:34.440]  and bainer and all these guys and bainer wasn't even one of the worst actually stabbed him in the
[03:36:34.440 --> 03:36:41.160]  back over and over again he is crazy and obviously donald trump's really smart and donald trump is
[03:36:41.160 --> 03:36:45.960]  fearless and he's done it his way he's discredited the media he has discredited the pollsters he's
[03:36:45.960 --> 03:36:51.320]  discredited the whole line system because we the people were backing it and everybody knows that
[03:36:51.320 --> 03:36:58.360]  they use the fact that info warriors were probably half of trump's base support and brought in a lot
[03:36:58.360 --> 03:37:04.280]  of blue collar folks and educated folks and liberal folks and reagan democrats that understand we're
[03:37:04.280 --> 03:37:08.760]  true liberals that want to restore the republic that's what a paleo conservative is these terms
[03:37:08.760 --> 03:37:15.640]  mean nothing and so we brought in the grassroots we brought in the reagan democrats we added that
[03:37:15.640 --> 03:37:23.000]  seal of americana that seal of true populism and that's been recognized and they tried to hang that
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:30.200]  wreath around donald trump's neck and said donald trump's alex jones's buddy donald trump quotes
[03:37:30.200 --> 03:37:36.360]  alex jones a lot donald trump repeats a lot of things alex jones says and then the media wrote
[03:37:36.360 --> 03:37:42.520]  articles saying alex jones is insane he thinks donald trump really likes him he thinks because
[03:37:42.520 --> 03:37:48.360]  donald trump has told him he's instrumental uh in the awakening of america uh that it's true
[03:37:48.360 --> 03:37:53.720]  so again it's that paradoxical system where they say one thing out of their mouth one day
[03:37:53.720 --> 03:37:58.520]  and another thing out of their mouth another day the truth is i know this movement is about info
[03:37:58.520 --> 03:38:04.280]  wars because it's about you and i go out on the streets of america when in many cases every other
[03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:10.200]  person i walk by is a lister and a viewer and i know they're black they're white they're hispanic
[03:38:10.200 --> 03:38:14.600]  they're old they're young they're from foreign countries and i know the demographics and i know
[03:38:14.600 --> 03:38:21.400]  the numbers we have of 60 plus million 70 million we're not even sure people that have tuned in in
[03:38:21.400 --> 03:38:26.840]  the last week just to our platforms this is world changing and the system knows that that's why
[03:38:26.840 --> 03:38:32.440]  they're trying to foment and fund all this garbage race war is because that's all an elite can do
[03:38:32.440 --> 03:38:39.400]  is try to divide and conquer us i'm not good yeah it's a public story he's racist how is he racist
[03:38:39.400 --> 03:38:47.320]  how yeah he's wrong we were told that there was no way that he could ever win the nomination
[03:38:47.880 --> 03:38:52.680]  and then they stole the nomination from sanders but trump fought for it so they had to back off
[03:38:53.560 --> 03:38:57.480]  and then there was clear evidence of election fraud all over the country bev hairs with the
[03:38:57.480 --> 03:39:01.800]  top election fraud experts in the world a democrat nonpartisan concur with my analysis that there
[03:39:01.800 --> 03:39:07.560]  was major discrepancies in at least five states all against trump the flipping of votes all across
[03:39:07.560 --> 03:39:14.120]  the country against trump the massive evidence of fraud but still there was such a tsunami wave
[03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:19.160]  as bev Harris and other experts have said and as trump has said you can't sheet a landslide
[03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:24.120]  the american people came out record numbers of black americans spanish americans
[03:39:24.120 --> 03:39:29.960]  voted for trump but the media tries to make it racial and call it a white lash to make
[03:39:30.520 --> 03:39:35.240]  anybody who stands up for sovereignty and lower taxes are racist but the good news is
[03:39:35.240 --> 03:39:40.840]  prosperity isn't racist and folks across the world not just here in the united states see
[03:39:40.840 --> 03:39:47.960]  through that economists understand that the american engine of liberty was so productive
[03:39:48.680 --> 03:39:56.440]  it was out producing the entire world by the early 1950s and even before that hundreds of years
[03:39:56.440 --> 03:40:01.080]  before british politicians wrote in the times of london you can pull this up it's in history books
[03:40:01.080 --> 03:40:07.400]  and said the american system is too free it's too open we need to shut it down and this was before
[03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:13.960]  we even had the revolutionary war they were calling the colonies the american system because they
[03:40:13.960 --> 03:40:19.960]  weren't following all the regulations and all the rules that they had in europe or they had in
[03:40:19.960 --> 03:40:24.200]  england that only allowed certain companies to produce certain things because they had a license
[03:40:24.200 --> 03:40:28.600]  from the government the government was picking the winners and losers and donald trump more than
[03:40:28.600 --> 03:40:34.040]  anything he's trying to just bring back basic america he's not even that hardcore folks and
[03:40:34.040 --> 03:40:38.040]  that's why they're so scared because they're up there running and selling the whole system
[03:40:38.680 --> 03:40:43.880]  and if he leaves any of those people in there and their whole networks it'll be impossible
[03:40:43.880 --> 03:40:47.800]  for him to get anything done and they're going to just sit there and wait to assassinate him
[03:40:47.800 --> 03:40:52.040]  they're going to sit there and wait till he's got his back turned and they've tricked him enough to
[03:40:52.040 --> 03:40:57.800]  put some of their operatives into the white house and they're going to move ahead full steam
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:03.160]  with their program finally i want to address this today i was on the radio
[03:41:03.160 --> 03:41:07.160]  and i said look he must go after hillary clinton she's committed all these crimes it's in all the
[03:41:07.160 --> 03:41:12.600]  emails the intelligence community leaked all this information because the globalists are
[03:41:12.600 --> 03:41:17.320]  planning to actually dismantle this country and in prosperity it's total criminality it must be
[03:41:17.320 --> 03:41:24.120]  exposed it must be ferreted out we must see her staffers indicted they're on the emails committing
[03:41:24.120 --> 03:41:29.800]  crimes cover-up she name it paper play we have to see hillary clinton indicted we have to see
[03:41:29.800 --> 03:41:34.520]  bill clinton indicted for haydie we have to see chelsea clinton get in trouble because they're not
[03:41:34.520 --> 03:41:41.480]  above the law they're not new royalty and it's been a long long time since the nixon era of 1974
[03:41:41.480 --> 03:41:47.320]  that we've seen any justice for these high-level quote officials who act like their imperial gods
[03:41:47.320 --> 03:41:52.440]  and think they're invincible because we've been treating them like their kim jong-un of north korea
[03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:58.520]  if hillary wasn't such a demon and if these globalists weren't so out of control and we were just
[03:41:58.520 --> 03:42:04.280]  kicking some you know syndicate out then i'd say let them go to abstentia let them leave
[03:42:05.240 --> 03:42:09.160]  they're never going to do that they're going to keep reorganizing and coming in they were
[03:42:09.160 --> 03:42:13.640]  planning to shut down the free press this year they were saying alex jones and drudge report
[03:42:13.640 --> 03:42:17.480]  don't have a right to exist we're going to come after it they've already handed the internet over
[03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:24.440]  to the un there is so much to reverse that we have to take this momentum and remove the corporate
[03:42:24.440 --> 03:42:30.120]  operatives that admit they've infiltrated and basically taken over our country show i will
[03:42:30.120 --> 03:42:37.720]  reiterate to make america great again we must take the country back trump has taken the white house
[03:42:37.720 --> 03:42:48.680]  phase one it's quite frankly 70 of the battle if he moves decisively now he has 70 of it but every
[03:42:48.680 --> 03:42:54.200]  hour ticking they put their people in over the next two months it's time for them to scheme
[03:42:54.200 --> 03:42:58.520]  and derail this and kill momentum and come up with new scams while they're off balance he has
[03:42:58.520 --> 03:43:03.320]  to come out and say i'll work with republicans but i want the leadership gone and i'll work with
[03:43:03.320 --> 03:43:08.360]  the democrats but uh dancy polosi and harry reid you've got to go we need new people that want to
[03:43:08.360 --> 03:43:13.320]  make this country great again from your ranks but not people that stabbed me in the back not people
[03:43:13.320 --> 03:43:17.720]  that have lied not people that have said i'm fit to i'm unfit to be president and half the country
[03:43:17.720 --> 03:43:22.920]  are deplorables we need to see a sign that you witness the referendum has happened in any other
[03:43:22.920 --> 03:43:29.000]  country in the uk and other areas throughout history if they had a route like this in a general
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:36.200]  election you would see resignations across the government people would be stepping down from
[03:43:36.200 --> 03:43:41.800]  parliament itself in the uk instead they all think they own the country they all think they get to
[03:43:41.800 --> 03:43:46.200]  stay there they all think they're god and there's one other big thing donald trump's gotta do
[03:43:48.360 --> 03:43:52.760]  donald trump has to dance with those that brung them and let me explain something i don't want
[03:43:52.760 --> 03:43:57.560]  to go to the inauguration i'll send crew to cover it i never wanted to be on red carpets or hollywood
[03:43:57.560 --> 03:44:03.160]  had that chance had a taste of it don't even care about it i'm saying you have to dance with the
[03:44:03.160 --> 03:44:08.760]  policies and the americana ideas that brought you we don't need to see donald trump all over the
[03:44:08.760 --> 03:44:15.160]  mainstream tv like obama did fawning with them and going on entertainment shows and and and and
[03:44:15.160 --> 03:44:21.000]  trying to be a america's friend we need somebody to be a leader to save this historic republic and
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:26.680]  i know donald trump clearly intends to do that but people are saying to me oh my gosh well donald
[03:44:26.680 --> 03:44:29.960]  trump come back on your shoulders donald trump call you or will you get to go to the white house
[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:34.040]  and eat dinner i don't want to go to the white house and eat dinner with a bunch of weirdo
[03:44:34.040 --> 03:44:39.480]  ambassadors and strange people i want to change the world here with the people in the grassroots
[03:44:39.480 --> 03:44:45.960]  and we've just done it i want to take our country back and make not just our nation but the world
[03:44:45.960 --> 03:44:55.160]  great again so this isn't about me wanting to get into the power structure by supporting the right
[03:44:55.160 --> 03:45:01.960]  candidate or asking for some job or wanting to get some corporate sponsorship i built my own system
[03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:08.680]  we do things our way we want and innovate it and are bigger than the establishment media by ourselves
[03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:14.040]  and we're just getting up on our legs right now info wars is changing the world you're changing
[03:45:14.040 --> 03:45:19.880]  the world and this whole process is about understanding that we're the underdog we're
[03:45:19.880 --> 03:45:25.400]  coming from behind like in 1776 against the greatest army the world had never defeated the
[03:45:25.400 --> 03:45:33.000]  british empire so you got all these politicos around trump and they're gonna tell him go along
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:38.440]  with the system go with what made you great go with what was a maverick that changed the whole
[03:45:38.440 --> 03:45:44.360]  system destroyed the entire political operation without spending you know money on their big
[03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:50.920]  networks you change the world so i know that you understand how critical it is to now take that to
[03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:56.440]  the next level and i have faith trump will do it he has had the instincts and the spirit of just
[03:45:56.440 --> 03:46:01.960]  something i've never seen in my life in someone running for office he is a maverick the consummate
[03:46:01.960 --> 03:46:07.720]  maverick and he succeeds in the next phase of this in the dictionary next to the word maverick
[03:46:07.720 --> 03:46:13.000]  there should be a picture of donald trump but all of you that went against the grain i'm not padding
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:18.360]  you on the head you are just as important as i am or as matt drudge is or as donald trump
[03:46:18.360 --> 03:46:22.520]  you're the people that got ridiculed and spit in your face and people attacking you wearing
[03:46:22.520 --> 03:46:26.840]  trump shirts you're the people that marched and took action and supported us so we could put
[03:46:26.840 --> 03:46:33.720]  airplanes up nationwide saying hillary for prison you're the ones that across the board are defending
[03:46:33.720 --> 03:46:41.080]  the second amendment and promoting sovereignty and promoting true basic freedom you're the oxygen
[03:46:41.080 --> 03:46:44.840]  that runs this whole thing you're the wind and the sails you are the most important
[03:46:46.280 --> 03:46:52.440]  you're not behind info wars you're at the heart of info wars you are the resistance you are the
[03:46:52.440 --> 03:46:57.480]  answer and so no matter what happens with trump as i said whether they steal it from him or not
[03:46:57.480 --> 03:47:01.960]  and i thought he was going to win because i had the poll numbers and talked to folks on the ground
[03:47:01.960 --> 03:47:07.320]  we win because we expose the globalist we promoted populism we expose the insider deals if they tried
[03:47:07.320 --> 03:47:12.200]  to steal it it blow up with their face even bigger now he wins in an electoral landslide
[03:47:13.560 --> 03:47:18.280]  and they're up there panicking and squirming and weaseling saying now they're ready to work with
[03:47:18.280 --> 03:47:26.040]  trump now they're ready to know you cannot trust people with a history of committing crimes against
[03:47:26.040 --> 03:47:31.560]  the republic they must be prosecuted because they will never stop their criminal activities until
[03:47:31.560 --> 03:47:38.280]  they've been brought to justice and it must be done so folks ask why didn't you go to the trump
[03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:43.160]  rally when he was here in austin you know i was invited and i said i said my crew we were there
[03:47:43.160 --> 03:47:48.200]  but i said when about a third of the people in the audience of 20 000 were wearing our t-shirts
[03:47:48.920 --> 03:47:55.800]  and when our reporters got mobbed we were the rally do you understand that we created the
[03:47:55.800 --> 03:48:00.920]  movement and the launchpad so there'd be a popular system against the globalist i said our best
[03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:06.920]  chance would be a libertarian bipartisan tea party movement taking over the republican party
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:11.720]  we analyzed it we looked at it from every angle i originally came up with a battle
[03:48:11.720 --> 03:48:16.760]  strategy of myself and openly pushed it to members of congress saying look for a candidate
[03:48:18.600 --> 03:48:23.240]  i had no idea behind the scenes generals and other people had picked up on the plan
[03:48:23.240 --> 03:48:27.640]  and my declaration of independence part two the drudge posted that went viral and that that was
[03:48:27.640 --> 03:48:36.360]  a small part of the generating the ideas of donald trump being drafted but trump knows from day one
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:40.360]  when people were trying to draft him to run for president they did it because they knew he was a
[03:48:40.360 --> 03:48:46.600]  good person and because they knew there was a giant liberty movement in the united states growing
[03:48:46.600 --> 03:48:51.320]  exponentially and the military and police were particularly dialed into it so i've given you
[03:48:51.320 --> 03:48:57.480]  some of the back history here as well just so people understand we don't need to be told
[03:48:57.480 --> 03:49:01.160]  how great we are we don't need to be padded on the head we don't need to be brought into the
[03:49:01.160 --> 03:49:06.200]  inside of the system because the whole scared system is telling trump keep us out i wouldn't
[03:49:06.200 --> 03:49:12.920]  go be part of it inside of they invited me in we're building the new system here that's what
[03:49:12.920 --> 03:49:18.520]  america was all about leave europe leave other oppressive areas come here set up something new
[03:49:18.520 --> 03:49:23.560]  it won't be perfect and when it gets corrupt move further out and here we are on the frontier
[03:49:23.560 --> 03:49:28.760]  building the new america building the new atlantis in central texas not in the old crumbling
[03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:37.080]  demonic pedophile run demon pit of dc or la or new york we're here in the new country
[03:49:37.080 --> 03:49:42.120]  and it's a spirit it's an idea and we're animating the contest of liberty we're animating the sleeping
[03:49:42.120 --> 03:49:47.800]  giant because we are the sleeping giant alex jones signing off for him full wars dot com
[03:49:47.800 --> 03:49:51.800]  if you're watching this transmission i've told you a thousand times god do you believe me you are
[03:49:51.800 --> 03:50:01.880]  the resistance thank you alex and he talks about wanting to build america again you know it's amazing
[03:50:01.880 --> 03:50:05.240]  what are we seeing right now with these protesters they're literally burning flags
[03:50:06.600 --> 03:50:10.840]  tearing america down now the reason i talk about this is because here's an interesting dynamic for
[03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:15.240]  me first of all i just got this story muslim student lies about hate crime by man and trump
[03:50:15.240 --> 03:50:20.440]  had so a muslim student makes up a story that a trump supporter ripped her he job off and
[03:50:20.440 --> 03:50:24.680]  shouted racial slurs at her she completely fabricated that a typical liar right out of
[03:50:24.680 --> 03:50:28.920]  the hillary clinton camp i'm sure a supporter of her that's what happens when you have a liar as
[03:50:28.920 --> 03:50:33.640]  a leader but here's what's crazy folks remember at the beginning of this election cycle what did
[03:50:33.640 --> 03:50:38.040]  the mainstream media say trump supporters were violent trump supporters were bad what do we see
[03:50:38.040 --> 03:50:42.600]  now the exact opposite what do they tell you at the end trump will not lose gracefully what are
[03:50:42.600 --> 03:50:46.360]  we seeing the clinton fans are the ones not losing gracefully when will people see that the

[03:55:25.560 --> 03:55:31.480]  peaceful left now of course what do we expect folks we just had a story about somebody lying

[03:56:11.160 --> 03:56:15.960]  i'm sorry to see that um it's got to be tough for all the clinton voters out there including
[03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:22.200]  share so share is now going to leave the planet she said she would go to jupiter if trump wins now
[03:56:22.200 --> 03:56:28.280]  of course so basically it was hillary or death for share but we'll find out is share gonna
[03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:35.640]  you know what here's what we should do elan musk come out with a new rocket and let's just send
[03:56:35.640 --> 03:56:40.440]  share to mars i mean someone's going to have to be the first trip to mars let's send share
[03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:47.400]  she's volunteered what a what you know what share you thought that you were going to make a stand
[03:56:47.400 --> 03:56:53.160]  against trump but what you really did was you just volunteered for the first mission to mars
[03:56:53.160 --> 03:56:58.440]  congratulations we'll send you to jupiter if you want but there's not going to be anywhere for you
[03:56:58.440 --> 03:57:04.360]  to land that's a ball of gas not sure if you're aware of that but then again what is share nothing
[03:57:04.360 --> 03:57:11.000]  but a ball of gas so i guess you go where you came from now john carrey recently visited an
[03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:15.320]  ant arctica everybody's saying oh my god it's the highest us official to ever visit ant arctica
[03:57:15.320 --> 03:57:20.360]  so he's going there to try to find out what's going on with climate change how it is affecting
[03:57:20.360 --> 03:57:26.760]  ant arctica well i'll tell you how john carrey now this is these are stories that are a bit dated
[03:57:27.480 --> 03:57:31.960]  as far as today is concerned but i've actually covered a few of these there have been multiple
[03:57:31.960 --> 03:57:41.000]  attempts in a similar fashion to go down to ant arctica and try to illustrate how the ice caps
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:45.640]  are melting and global warming is basically causing ant arctica to disappear but here's a
[03:57:45.640 --> 03:57:52.840]  daily caller story from this year in july global warming expedition stopped in its tracks by arctic
[03:57:52.840 --> 03:57:58.040]  sea ice there are multiple stories of this actually if you scroll down here guys they actually list
[03:57:58.040 --> 03:58:05.640]  how there are multiple examples of this folks they take these boats okay and what the liberal
[03:58:06.760 --> 03:58:12.680]  global warming captains and crew on this ship think they're doing on these boats think they're
[03:58:12.680 --> 03:58:17.560]  doing is they think that they're going to go prove that everything has melted down there and they can
[03:58:17.560 --> 03:58:23.400]  just you know float right up to the to the land guess what happens they get trapped in ice and
[03:58:23.400 --> 03:58:28.520]  then they have to get hauled out because they're stuck in ice but you know what screw everything
[03:58:28.520 --> 03:58:32.200]  i'm just going to do the mannequin challenge because that's what's cool here's my mannequin
