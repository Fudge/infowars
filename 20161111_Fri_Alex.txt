[00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.311]  We did it!
[00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:13.133]  It's Friday.
[00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:21.618]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:25.980]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.143]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:32.444]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:32.604]  It's 11-11.
[00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:42.210]  Friday, November 11, 2016, I am recharged, refocused, and I can see the enemy's battle plan.
[00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:52.977]  Prepare, because I will lay out the clearest, most accurate analysis of the globalist counter-strike and how we defeat them for good, straight ahead, but first...
[00:00:53.977 --> 00:01:05.001]  So when you stand and deliver that State of the Union address, in no part of your mind or brain can you imagine Donald Trump standing up one day and delivering a State of the Union address?
[00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:09.583]  Well, I can imagine it in a Saturday night skit.
[00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:12.824]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be President.
[00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:15.945]  He will never be President of the United States.
[00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:19.347]  Donald Trump will never be elected President of the United States.
[00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:25.349]  Donald Trump is not going to become President of the United States.
[00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:28.611]  Donald Trump is not going to be President of the United States.
[00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:31.592]  I'm respectful of the fact that the people have not voted.
[00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:35.709]  He's not going to be President of the United States.
[00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.092]  Donald Trump is not going to be President of the United States.
[00:01:38.092 --> 00:01:39.133]  Let's be clear.
[00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.855]  Donald Trump will lose the election.
[00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:43.318]  I have one thing to say, one thing only.
[00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:46.201]  And that is that this race is over.
[00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.044]  I think Donald Trump will be the nominee and will lose badly.
[00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:53.366]  No one's gonna be happier than President Obama when Trump loses.
[00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:53.946]  No one.
[00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.127]  That's a myth.
[00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:57.127]  I think that Donald Trump's campaign is over.
[00:01:57.127 --> 00:01:58.248]  Like it's a zombie, right?
[00:01:58.248 --> 00:01:59.549]  Like it's a walking dead.
[00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.309]  It's not... There's nowhere for him to go.
[00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:06.292]  And the fact that most people think Donald Trump is going to lose probably means Donald Trump is going to lose.
[00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:11.614]  When the inevitable happens, which is a very substantial landslide victory on November 8th.
[00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:14.916]  And we need, when this race is over, to talk about why that was.
[00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:17.198]  I personally think this race is over.
[00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:18.499]  To me, this race is over.
[00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:24.104]  Politico's latest survey of political insiders agrees, quote, Clinton will crush Trump in November.
[00:02:24.104 --> 00:02:27.946]  Well, that's real Donald Trump.
[00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:32.250]  At least I will go down as a president.
[00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.091]  No.
[00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:35.552]  You were never a real president.
[00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:37.654]  You were a globalist operative installed.
[00:02:37.654 --> 00:02:39.916]  This is the return of the republic.
[00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:45.340]  We have a beachhead now in Washington that's been captured by the globalists.
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.243]  And if President-elect Trump acts like a true American, he will be able to drain that swamp.
[00:02:51.243 --> 00:02:53.504]  But understand something.
[00:02:53.504 --> 00:03:03.269]  The crocodiles, the sharks, the grendels that live in that swamp are not going to let him do it without trying to take him and us out with him.
[00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.312]  He cannot make deals with them.
[00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:10.615]  He must prosecute Hillary and the other top criminals.
[00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:13.877]  He must remove Paul Ryan, who's been caught in the WikiLeaks with Hillary.
[00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:16.580]  He's done if Trump moves against him.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.705]  Trump, in his first six months to a year, has the Arthurian sword he's pulled from a stone.
[00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:24.347]  I'm going to say this again.
[00:03:24.347 --> 00:03:29.011]  To pull the sword is half the battle.
[00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:30.352]  The second half is using it.
[00:03:33.188 --> 00:03:34.029]  He's the president.
[00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.210]  We've been occupied by foreign outside powers.
[00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.733]  It is not authoritarianism to say that if he has to encamp the U.S.
[00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:47.437]  military in Washington to arrest these people and bring them before juries or kick the foreign operatives out, he has to do it.
[00:03:47.437 --> 00:03:49.659]  We are under espionage attack.
[00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.620]  Russia kicked the Soros group out.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.702]  Soros must be arrested.
[00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:55.903]  And the people are behind Trump.
[00:03:56.943 --> 00:04:04.428]  Now Trump's playing nice with him right now because he's not in power yet and he's in the maximum danger of the next 70 days.
[00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:05.990]  Maximal danger.
[00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.673]  He is a major vector target right now.
[00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:12.915]  Attack vector.
[00:04:12.915 --> 00:04:15.316]  They are coming at him from every side.
[00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:23.843]  And I'm here to tell you, the best sign I saw was him not telling the mainstream media when he was leaving Washington.
[00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.834]  Or where he was going or when he was leaving New York and just totally ignoring them.
[00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:31.077]  That's a good sign because that's not media.
[00:04:31.077 --> 00:04:36.423]  That's globalist, occupied enemy forces of disinformation and America hate.
[00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:49.784]  That are absolutely discredited and hated, and he needs to support the new independent media, which is going to continue expanding regardless, and point out it's real, and totally ignore them, and draw a demarcation line.
[00:04:49.784 --> 00:04:56.007]  Because, we see the evidence, they're only intensifying their attacks right now.
[00:04:56.007 --> 00:04:57.388]  Thank God they're so arrogant.
[00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:06.218]  Three days after the election of Donald Trump and the reality of a Trump presidency is starting to hit home.
[00:05:06.218 --> 00:05:11.600]  For some people, this is such a devastating notion that they need to call an ambulance or even want to die.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.522]  Well, we Trump voters care about our fellow Americans and we're paying by this.
[00:05:15.522 --> 00:05:17.423]  So let's help the Trump protesters.
[00:05:17.423 --> 00:05:20.024]  Let's try to help them recover from their devastation.
[00:05:20.024 --> 00:05:25.247]  If you see a Trump protester or a group of them, give them a diaper, hand them a binky, cover them in a blankie.
[00:05:25.247 --> 00:05:27.348]  After all, this is what you do for crying babies.
[00:05:27.668 --> 00:05:31.451]  Many of these people look like they need a hug, so give them a box of huggies!
[00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:39.056]  We Trump voters can't stand to see our fellow Americans so depleted, so we will make sure to get as many of them a warm bottle of milk as possible.
[00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:45.541]  To make America great again, we must make sure that these babies are taken care of with plenty of diapers, binkies, and rattles.
[00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:47.122]  Don't worry, Trump protesters.
[00:05:47.122 --> 00:05:50.724]  Remember, we're stronger together, even if you do have to wear a diaper.
[00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:54.007]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[00:05:54.007 --> 00:05:55.468]  This message is paid for by the Russians.
[00:06:00.034 --> 00:06:03.256]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[00:06:03.256 --> 00:06:07.358]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[00:06:07.358 --> 00:06:10.019]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:12.841]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:18.044]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[00:06:18.664 --> 00:06:24.793]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[00:06:24.793 --> 00:06:31.061]  God was in school, morality had a future, and the beef was for supper.
[00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:33.645]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:35.186]  We're the solution!
[00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.106]  Americans!
[00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:37.667]  Ain't nothin' more to it than that!
[00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:43.071]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:44.892]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[00:06:44.892 --> 00:06:46.313]  DVDs now available.
[00:06:46.313 --> 00:06:50.235]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[00:06:50.235 --> 00:06:55.839]  RevelationTheMovie.info Americans need to see this film.
[00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:59.381]  RevelationTheMovie.info Let's fix it.
[00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:06.363]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:07:06.363 --> 00:07:09.584]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:15.166]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:21.288]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:07:21.288 --> 00:07:24.569]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.009]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:30.531]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:33.472]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:07:33.472 --> 00:07:35.133]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:07:35.133 --> 00:07:38.574]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:41.175]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:42.236]  It's in powder form.
[00:07:42.236 --> 00:07:45.117]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:07:45.117 --> 00:07:46.137]  I take this.
[00:07:46.137 --> 00:07:47.638]  This is the product that I take.
[00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:49.599]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:51.220]  We fight the Globals.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.381]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:56.765]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:02.910]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.373]  Americanism, not globalism!
[00:08:06.373 --> 00:08:11.858]  Americanism, not globalism!
[00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:19.592]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[00:08:19.592 --> 00:08:26.056]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[00:08:26.056 --> 00:08:33.921]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:38.724]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better.
[00:08:39.264 --> 00:08:42.205]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:56.993]  Right here in Detroit.
[00:08:56.993 --> 00:08:59.094]  It's all training us to accept less.
[00:08:59.094 --> 00:09:00.435]  Lowering expectations.
[00:09:00.435 --> 00:09:01.816]  A post-industrial world.
[00:09:01.816 --> 00:09:02.777]  A new dark age.
[00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:06.860]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:15.527]  When we abandoned the policy of America first, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[00:09:15.527 --> 00:09:19.930]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.632]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunted.
[00:09:24.453 --> 00:09:30.034]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[00:09:30.034 --> 00:09:32.075]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:32.075 --> 00:09:33.355]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[00:09:33.355 --> 00:09:35.696]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[00:09:35.696 --> 00:09:37.836]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[00:09:37.836 --> 00:09:40.057]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:46.458]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:51.519]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:55.060]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.620]  They're mistreated.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.381]  She claims to be their champion.
[00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:07.222]  Don't look at me, Winston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life!
[00:10:07.222 --> 00:10:11.683]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity!
[00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:12.984]  We're here to hurt humans!
[00:10:12.984 --> 00:10:14.384]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:23.576]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:10:23.576 --> 00:10:36.326]  That sounded pretty extreme a couple months ago and I read from 1984 and basically paraphrased a little bit of the end there about how the priest of power, Satanists in government, want to hurt themselves, hurt you, and hurt everybody else.
[00:10:36.326 --> 00:10:43.432]  But then you get the WikiLeaks and it's all about keeping us poor, hurting us, hating us, hating each other, and you guessed it, Satanism.
[00:10:45.063 --> 00:10:47.025]  This is what really goes on in the world, folks.
[00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:52.589]  This is what's happened in every culture, in every civilization, when decadence hits a certain bottom level.
[00:10:52.589 --> 00:11:08.463]  And it appears, worldwide, that we've gone to the bottom of this particular mineshaft, this particular trench, this particular gateway to hell, and maybe trying to scrabble up towards the surface.
[00:11:08.463 --> 00:11:12.746]  But if people say, Alex, be more happy about this election, we've hit bottom, hopefully,
[00:11:13.752 --> 00:11:18.474]  We're now trying to go back to the surface.
[00:11:18.474 --> 00:11:25.236]  And I've never been some deep sea diver, but I've been 80, 90 feet down and can't get water out of my mask.
[00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:32.258]  And start to panic and just relax and just kick your fins and go back to the surface.
[00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:38.520]  And I feel like we're trying to get back to the surface, but I'll be honest, I don't know how much water is on top of us.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.781]  I don't know how deep we went, do you?
[00:11:40.781 --> 00:11:41.841]  Just what I know of is
[00:11:43.408 --> 00:11:48.972]  Super deep, super dangerous, and let's be honest, it's always worse than I thought, isn't it?
[00:11:48.972 --> 00:11:56.256]  My only mistake is that it's almost always worse than Jones thinks.
[00:11:56.256 --> 00:12:00.139]  I am sickened by how on target I've been so far.
[00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:06.423]  I've not been pleased with our analysis turning out to be dead on.
[00:12:06.423 --> 00:12:08.044]  Dead on as far down as I can see.
[00:12:09.758 --> 00:12:12.519]  He keeps swimming down, it keeps getting deeper, doesn't it?
[00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:25.624]  But it feels like we've hit bottom and we're trying to struggle up right now and we've got enough air in our tanks, but we cannot celebrate yet because... I put a video out yesterday and I said he's in the most danger he's ever been.
[00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:28.545]  They've sent all these newspapers and TV shows killing.
[00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:32.667]  Nothing was ever done because the Justice Department wouldn't allow the Secret Service to call for prosecution.
[00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:35.908]  And believe me, the Secret Service called for the prosecution thousands of times.
[00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:38.389]  They caught people planning attacks on Trump and couldn't do anything.
[00:12:40.546 --> 00:12:42.688]  Lawlessness.
[00:12:42.688 --> 00:12:46.511]  Soros funding all these destabilization groups.
[00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:47.913]  They're not playing games.
[00:12:47.913 --> 00:12:50.295]  So I've shot a lot of special reports warning of this in the past.
[00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:54.438]  I shot one last night and I saw some of the trolls going, oh Alex, whatever, you fear monger.
[00:12:54.438 --> 00:12:54.999]  Really.
[00:12:54.999 --> 00:12:55.599]  Today.
[00:12:55.599 --> 00:12:56.700]  Articles on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:58.735 --> 00:13:05.938]  Massive, massive, massive calls for Trump to be killed in the media and on Twitter and on Facebook.
[00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:11.941]  And then we have people on CNN and on MSNBC saying it's time to kill Trump, kill his supporters, it's time for blood.
[00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:23.387]  And the media is like nodding their head trying to call for a revolution when we just saw the revolution against the media, against the foreign banks, against Hollywood.
[00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:24.027]  Do you understand?
[00:13:24.027 --> 00:13:25.908]  You just lost the revolution.
[00:13:26.832 --> 00:13:33.219]  And you stole five states and you still got your ass handed to you.
[00:13:33.219 --> 00:13:34.681]  That's why they were all so stunned.
[00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:41.148]  The tsunami was so mega hammer that you couldn't stop it.
[00:13:41.148 --> 00:13:42.570]  Your seawall wasn't big enough.
[00:13:43.527 --> 00:13:47.128]  So Katy Perry, again, says we need revolution, we need to get violence.
[00:13:47.128 --> 00:13:56.492]  Let me tell you something, Tartt, and I know your daddy, he's been on the show, and I know Russell Brand, and I woke Russell Brand up to a great extent, he said it on the show, and you used to be awake.
[00:13:56.492 --> 00:14:06.215]  In fact, you pretty much broke up, or at least broke up with each other over the fact that you wanted to go the whole Hitlerian route, I guess, with the Democrats, and Brand doesn't like either group.
[00:14:06.215 --> 00:14:08.036]  But, sweetheart, this is the real world.
[00:14:08.036 --> 00:14:08.776]  You want to play general?
[00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:13.445]  If there is a big bloody civil war, you're going to get prosecuted, lady.
[00:14:13.445 --> 00:14:17.468]  You can't sit up there and tell 50 million fans it's time to get violent.
[00:14:17.468 --> 00:14:21.831]  You know how many racial attacks there were against innocent white people yesterday?
[00:14:21.831 --> 00:14:26.795]  So many, I can't even keep track of them.
[00:14:26.795 --> 00:14:28.977]  And again, Katie, you're a beautiful woman.
[00:14:28.977 --> 00:14:29.877]  You're very talented.
[00:14:29.877 --> 00:14:30.678]  Your dad's a listener.
[00:14:30.678 --> 00:14:31.439]  He's been on the show.
[00:14:31.439 --> 00:14:35.402]  I know all the inside baseball.
[00:14:35.402 --> 00:14:37.663]  Stop.
[00:14:37.663 --> 00:14:37.944]  Stop.
[00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.411]  Dave Mustaine told me all this stuff, and I got contacted by her dad.
[00:14:42.411 --> 00:14:49.432]  I don't want to get into all of it, but Katy Perry is a very haunted person, and I feel sorry for her, and I don't want to go off on some jag about her.
[00:14:49.432 --> 00:14:50.912]  It's just, come on, Katy!
[00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:52.913]  Hillary's not a nice lady.
[00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:59.574]  Just because you're a record company, some big globalist operation, Hollywood-controlled, tells you to act like a fool, stop it!
[00:14:59.574 --> 00:15:02.755]  But I'm not going to digress.
[00:15:02.755 --> 00:15:03.955]  If Trump gets killed,
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.982]  I want to explain something to the New World Order.
[00:15:06.982 --> 00:15:08.563]  I think they get this.
[00:15:08.563 --> 00:15:14.169]  It's only going to make our movement for nationalism against globalism three or four times stronger.
[00:15:14.169 --> 00:15:16.311]  He's such a strong leader and such a patriot.
[00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:16.671]  Hold on.
[00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:18.092]  I've got to take this.
[00:15:18.092 --> 00:15:20.034]  I've got to play a tape, guys.
[00:15:20.034 --> 00:15:24.358]  Of course, my phone's not working.
[00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:25.019]  This is bizarre.
[00:15:26.564 --> 00:15:28.025]  Yeah, play the Paul George Watson.
[00:15:28.025 --> 00:15:28.965]  Uh, hello?
[00:15:28.965 --> 00:15:42.111]  After weeks of taunting Trump supporters over Trump's suggestion that he might not immediately accept the election result, Hillary voters came together, preached a message of unity, and graciously accepted Donald Trump's victory.
[00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:47.814]  Oh no, they actually rioted, attacked people in the street, and threatened to kill Donald Trump and his supporters!
[00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:55.578]  He refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.
[00:15:55.578 --> 00:15:55.738]  Now,
[00:15:56.553 --> 00:16:02.960]  Make no mistake, by doing that, he is threatening our democracy.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:10.428]  And the peaceful transition, the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart.
[00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:14.192]  It's how we hold our country together, no matter who's in charge.
[00:16:14.192 --> 00:16:16.054]  All year, they preached the mantra.
[00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:18.016]  Love Trump's hate.
[00:16:18.016 --> 00:16:22.180]  All year they denounced us as being hateful and intolerant.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.383]  And what's the first thing they do after the election?
[00:16:25.383 --> 00:16:27.365]  Engage in rampant hateful intolerance.
[00:16:27.365 --> 00:16:32.971]  This tolerant liberal called for people to die to prevent Trump from taking office.
[00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:35.013]  We can't just do rallies.
[00:16:35.013 --> 00:16:36.294]  We have to fight back.
[00:16:36.294 --> 00:16:38.677]  There will be casualties on both sides.
[00:16:38.677 --> 00:16:42.121]  There will be because people have to die to make a change in this world.
[00:16:42.121 --> 00:16:43.423]  Look at this idiot.
[00:16:43.423 --> 00:16:47.047]  Wall Street is the enemy, not Muslims or immigrants.
[00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:51.392]  You just voted for someone whose entire campaign was funded by Wall Street.
[00:16:51.392 --> 00:16:53.274]  You utter f***ing moron.
[00:16:53.274 --> 00:16:54.015]  Look at this clown.
[00:16:54.255 --> 00:16:54.955]  I am gay.
[00:16:54.955 --> 00:16:55.716]  I am in love.
[00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:56.816]  I am terrified.
[00:16:56.816 --> 00:17:04.900]  Yeah, you didn't seem to be too terrified by 20% of Hillary's campaign being funded by a country that still executes gay people.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:12.683]  Seriously, has anyone told you people that you can't change the result of a democratic election by throwing a temper tantrum?
[00:17:12.683 --> 00:17:19.906]  The Electoral College isn't going to look at you burning a Donald Trump effigy and think, oh well, a bunch of butt-hurt losers had a hissy fit.
[00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:26.612]  So I guess we better just invalidate the entire election and just have everyone vote again until Hillary wins.
[00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:27.673]  This isn't fair.
[00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:33.939]  I need Hillary to stand up right now and walk in and sue the United States of America.
[00:17:33.939 --> 00:17:36.001]  That's not how it works.
[00:17:36.001 --> 00:17:40.706]  You're literally protesting against free democratic elections.
[00:17:40.706 --> 00:17:44.570]  Your behavior is why Trump won in the first place.
[00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.031]  Do you understand that yet?
[00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:53.596]  Americans saw you attacking innocent people, burning s*** down, and rioting all year.
[00:17:53.596 --> 00:17:58.279]  And they responded by voting against what you represent.
[00:17:58.279 --> 00:18:03.402]  Also, you're carrying Mexican flags while chanting, Trump is not my president.
[00:18:03.402 --> 00:18:05.464]  You know that this is America, right?
[00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:08.592]  Do you know what country you're actually in?
[00:18:08.592 --> 00:18:13.554]  SJWs are trying to pressure the Electoral College to disregard the vote altogether.
[00:18:13.554 --> 00:18:20.396]  Because blocking the outcome of legitimate free elections because you don't like the result is so progressive!
[00:18:20.396 --> 00:18:24.198]  It's not what dictators in third world countries do at all!
[00:18:24.198 --> 00:18:27.259]  Now Katy Perry thinks that she's Shea Guevara.
[00:18:27.259 --> 00:18:29.240]  Rise up, a revolution is coming!
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:29.840]  Seriously.
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.642]  F*** off to North Korea.
[00:18:32.642 --> 00:18:33.763]  You'd like it there.
[00:18:33.763 --> 00:18:38.947]  You won't have to worry about elections because your candidate wins every time.
[00:18:38.947 --> 00:18:42.350]  Look at the unhinged insanity that motivates these people.
[00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:47.775]  I remember yesterday when I was naive and I thought the September 11 attacks were the worst thing that could happen to America.
[00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:48.556]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:18:48.556 --> 00:18:59.804]  9-11, a terrorist attack that killed thousands of people, that led to multiple wars, that killed hundreds of thousands more people, and ruined the Middle East.
[00:18:59.804 --> 00:19:01.265]  Donald Trump is worse than that!
[00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:01.826]  Yay!
[00:19:01.826 --> 00:19:03.707]  Let's all get ready for World War II!
[00:19:03.707 --> 00:19:04.088]  Hey, di-
[00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:07.456]  World War II already happened.
[00:19:07.456 --> 00:19:09.477]  I have friends that are literally scared for their lives.
[00:19:09.477 --> 00:19:12.398]  Personally, I don't think a president should have that kind of mass effect on people.
[00:19:12.398 --> 00:19:21.962]  They're probably scared because for the last year, you've been regurgitating hysterical media propaganda about how Donald Trump is literally Hitler.
[00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:27.204]  It's your own fault that they're scared of a democratically elected president.
[00:19:27.204 --> 00:19:30.925]  And it's the media to blame for inciting these anti-Trump riots.
[00:19:30.925 --> 00:19:34.527]  They're even paying people to play the role of anti-Trump agitators.
[00:19:34.727 --> 00:19:44.171]  If Trump supporters had reacted to a Hillary victory like this, the media would be denouncing them right now as dangerous, democracy-hating bigots.
[00:19:44.171 --> 00:19:49.593]  The media is also reporting on all this as if it's some kind of spontaneous grassroots uprising.
[00:19:49.593 --> 00:19:50.794]  Wrong again!
[00:19:50.794 --> 00:19:57.477]  It's been coordinated and paid for by billionaire globalist scumbag George Soros and MoveOn.org.
[00:19:57.477 --> 00:20:00.338]  In Austin, the protesters were even loaded onto special buses.
[00:20:00.888 --> 00:20:03.410]  Have you ever wanted to quit your job and be your own boss?
[00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.291]  Interested in investing in real estate?

[00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:01.066]  It's crazy.
[00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:03.567]  I got so excited when I saw he was calling me.
[00:24:13.234 --> 00:24:21.078]  That I was like trying to do the swipe to answer it, and it wouldn't work because I was so excited.
[00:24:21.078 --> 00:24:21.998]  Only if you were that excited.
[00:24:21.998 --> 00:24:27.781]  It's like in the horror movie, you're trying to get your key in the car to start it when the monster's coming after you, but you're so excited you drop the keys.
[00:24:27.781 --> 00:24:28.461]  Well, this is the opposite.
[00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:31.882]  So excited I couldn't even get the thing swiped properly.
[00:24:31.882 --> 00:24:34.724]  I tell you, the Twilight Zone nature of my life has certainly gone into
[00:24:36.061 --> 00:24:36.782]  Beyond Bizarre!
[00:24:50.569 --> 00:24:52.831]  Infowars, I'm bragging about you.
[00:24:52.831 --> 00:25:01.018]  They did the numbers last night, and I've been saying 75 million tuned in in the last week just on Facebook and Twitter and our own internal videos and YouTube.
[00:25:01.018 --> 00:25:11.447]  I'm sorry, Zimmerman is doing the numbers right now to finish it up, but it was right around 90 million last night when I left at about 7 o'clock.
[00:25:11.447 --> 00:25:18.693]  90 million people in the last seven days just on videos.
[00:25:20.495 --> 00:25:31.683]  And I mean, one video with two million, one with five million, one with three million, and it's like pieces of the stream, because you can't just put like a seven-day stream out, so we chop it up every two hours, four hours, six hours, depending on when we're here.
[00:25:31.683 --> 00:25:32.884]  Overnight, it's like a six-hour chunk.
[00:25:32.884 --> 00:25:36.827]  A lot of nights, we were only gone two hours, so we cut them in pieces.
[00:25:36.827 --> 00:25:39.509]  People like shorter pieces.
[00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:44.413]  But this is big pieces, and it had 90 million views.
[00:25:44.413 --> 00:25:45.994]  That's bigger than Fox, folks.
[00:25:47.247 --> 00:25:50.169]  They're in their own world, and Trump knows they're in their own world.
[00:25:50.169 --> 00:25:54.273]  Fox is the biggest thing out there, and that's why he just dissed the entire media.
[00:25:54.273 --> 00:26:04.641]  The most positive thing I've seen, because we made the joke that once he gets into office, it's one thing if he has some establishment folks that guide him through the mines of Moria, to use the Lord of the Rings analogy.
[00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:06.342]  If you're not a J.R.R.
[00:26:06.342 --> 00:26:09.365]  Tolkien fan, you won't know what I'm talking about, but I think most people are from the movies.
[00:26:09.365 --> 00:26:14.609]  It's one thing if he has a guide that's kind of a bad guy to take him through the mines of Moria or under the mountain.
[00:26:17.046 --> 00:26:23.891]  If you, you know, if you catch him kissing goblins, or if you catch him in bed with a goblin, you know, that's a problem.
[00:26:23.891 --> 00:26:27.634]  If he says signs onto the TPP, that's in bed with a goblin.
[00:26:27.634 --> 00:26:34.819]  Trump charging into a goblin's nest, kissing goblins, goblin vomit, catch him in bed with a goblin.
[00:26:34.819 --> 00:26:41.504]  Now, because we're going to have a new scale here, I'm actually going to have it made digitally where it's on a scale of goblins.
[00:26:41.504 --> 00:26:43.465]  You know, is he charging into a goblin's nest?
[00:26:43.465 --> 00:26:44.246]  Hacking them to pieces?
[00:26:45.225 --> 00:26:47.766]  Or is it just going, you know, around the goblins?
[00:26:47.766 --> 00:26:51.347]  Is it kissing goblins, even though you still stab them, you give them a kiss?
[00:26:51.347 --> 00:26:53.948]  Or is it catching them in bed with a goblin?
[00:26:53.948 --> 00:27:02.491]  And then the final scale, is Trump going to have babies with a goblin and actually help the New World Order and turn against us like Darth Vader?
[00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:03.631]  Is he going to marry a goblin?
[00:27:05.134 --> 00:27:06.716]  She just learned about another level of the scale.
[00:27:06.716 --> 00:27:09.658]  Not just in bed with a goblin, marry a goblin.
[00:27:09.658 --> 00:27:11.580]  That'll be all over the news now.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.685]  And then they think it's discrediting to attack us with that, and then all it does is make everybody love us that more.
[00:27:16.685 --> 00:27:26.554]  See, they in the WikiLeaks were saying, let's push Trump because he'll discredit the whole
[00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:28.351]  T.O.P.
[00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:30.392]  and then if he becomes the nominee, we'll be able to defeat him.
[00:27:30.392 --> 00:27:36.815]  Now, pretty soon they figured out, no, he's actually popular, he's gonna destroy us within a few months, so they changed all that, too late.
[00:27:36.815 --> 00:27:46.780]  He got the nomination, and then he defeated Hillary, who tried to steal the election in a landslide, and now, Wolf Blitzer is whining and bitching like someone robbed him.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:52.723]  This is outrageous, this is incredible, you didn't have a press conference with us, this is unacceptable.
[00:27:53.824 --> 00:27:57.728]  And then he just flew off and didn't even tell us from DC to New York.
[00:27:57.728 --> 00:27:58.668]  I said this on air.
[00:27:59.958 --> 00:28:02.118]  I hope he moves out of the White House.
[00:28:02.118 --> 00:28:11.940]  It's too small, it's not safe, and moves into one of his big mansions and builds a big armored wall around it and puts in big, you know, facilities for the Secret Service and everybody else.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.741]  He's got mansions next to office buildings and just has his own White House.
[00:28:15.741 --> 00:28:18.902]  Just break with everything, except the Republic.
[00:28:18.902 --> 00:28:20.882]  Move out of that captured nest.
[00:28:20.882 --> 00:28:25.763]  Move back in once we've recaptured Washington, but don't move into the middle of the enemy encampment.
[00:28:25.763 --> 00:28:26.523]  Move out of there.
[00:28:27.759 --> 00:28:32.422]  Just spiritually you need to, and all the surveillance, and all the spies, and all the crap.
[00:28:32.422 --> 00:28:35.104]  It's just absolutely horrible.
[00:28:35.104 --> 00:28:39.647]  Only go there maybe a few days a week, you know, have that be your other office, and just get away from these people.
[00:28:39.647 --> 00:28:41.489]  And I said don't do press conferences with them.
[00:28:41.489 --> 00:28:45.872]  Do your own big daily announcements, and then do like they do.
[00:28:45.872 --> 00:28:48.854]  Say, we're gonna just bring in the Patriot Media.
[00:28:48.854 --> 00:28:52.076]  Hmm, dun-dun-dun-dun, and here comes all the correspondents.
[00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:52.957]  Hundreds and hundreds of them.
[00:28:54.787 --> 00:28:58.728]  You know what, we're not as bad as they are, so you know what, no, let's just have it open to everybody.
[00:28:58.728 --> 00:29:17.531]  The point is, is that dissing these people is keen, and I get the fact that so the stock market wouldn't plunge and so there wouldn't be bigger riots, he played the part of the facilitator to go and meet with Obama and say you're a good person, you know, we owe you for what you've done, it was a total lie, but he was kissing a goblin.
[00:29:17.531 --> 00:29:23.592]  The goblin did not look pleased, I will tell you, because he understood what Trump was doing was devastating him.
[00:29:24.472 --> 00:29:31.855]  And, of course, it was a lesser man next to a real man, a self-made man, Obama, a globalist operative, destroying this country and his own people.
[00:29:31.855 --> 00:29:33.436]  But it's a big day, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:33.436 --> 00:29:34.776]  It's a new day.
[00:29:34.776 --> 00:29:36.237]  It's a new life.
[00:29:36.237 --> 00:29:37.597]  Birds flying high.
[00:29:37.597 --> 00:29:39.098]  I tell you, I know how they feel.
[00:29:39.098 --> 00:29:41.859]  We ought to play that coming back.
[00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:42.739]  Whoo!
[00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:44.020]  Good stuff, baby!
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.240]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.861]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.652 --> 00:29:53.576]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.576 --> 00:29:56.278]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.902]  The NFL is considering some serious changes as ratings continue to plummet.
[00:30:04.902 --> 00:30:11.624]  Some of the changes include reducing ads and ad time, reducing the time of game, to perhaps even changing the way it's officiated.
[00:30:11.624 --> 00:30:26.350]  These were among the things mentioned by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to increase ratings, but he failed to mention the protest of our country by some of its players, like Colin Paperneck, Erika Reid, Kenny Schills, Jackie Tartt, Elizabeth Harreld, and Luz Irving.
[00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:31.533]  Who have been protesting the country during the National Anthem, which without a doubt is affecting ratings.
[00:30:31.533 --> 00:30:37.236]  Wait, the players in the league are protesting the people in the country who drive the high ratings, and the ratings are dropping?
[00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:37.916]  Shocking.
[00:30:37.916 --> 00:30:40.417]  But the PCNFL can't address this.
[00:30:40.417 --> 00:30:54.825]  Perhaps the silver lining in all of this is that people are less inclined to being obsessed with football all day long, and have been following the presidential election, as well as other local and national issues, that they see they can affect with vigilance and action, not just taking a knee.
[00:30:55.365 --> 00:30:57.492]  This is Owen Troyer from InfoWars.com
[00:31:00.126 --> 00:31:05.188]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:01.639]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:05.942]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown?
[00:32:05.942 --> 00:32:09.505]  Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[00:32:09.505 --> 00:32:11.547]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[00:32:11.547 --> 00:32:14.449]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[00:32:14.449 --> 00:32:19.973]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALEX.
[00:32:19.973 --> 00:32:21.354]  It's a company I trust.
[00:32:21.354 --> 00:32:27.138]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown.
[00:32:27.438 --> 00:32:30.659]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:35.100]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:40.942]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[00:32:40.942 --> 00:32:41.602]  Don't delay.
[00:32:41.602 --> 00:32:48.624]  Call 844-541-ALEX now and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely store your coins absolutely free.
[00:32:48.624 --> 00:32:53.105]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.

[00:32:56.046 --> 00:32:57.326]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX-NOW.
[00:32:57.326 --> 00:32:58.126]  You know how I feel.
[00:32:58.126 --> 00:33:07.628]  Sun in the sky.
[00:33:07.628 --> 00:33:09.229]  You know how I feel.
[00:33:21.753 --> 00:33:27.417]  For all of us, it would just take it in our hands.
[00:33:27.417 --> 00:33:30.819]  Because this is 1776.
[00:34:01.923 --> 00:34:03.404]  You know I'm feeling good?
[00:34:03.404 --> 00:34:10.329]  I had the tumblers going in my brain for days after victory.
[00:34:10.329 --> 00:34:11.670]  Couldn't sleep.
[00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:16.654]  Because I hadn't gotten the approximation yet for victory.
[00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:18.175]  And then I saw it all click.
[00:34:18.175 --> 00:34:21.337]  And then I knew the next moves they'd make yesterday.
[00:34:21.337 --> 00:34:29.143]  And then all of a sudden, I saw it going exactly like I'd envisioned.
[00:34:29.143 --> 00:34:30.564]  And I'm feeling good.
[00:34:33.328 --> 00:34:34.989]  It's a hell of a species.
[00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:37.151]  Been through too much.
[00:34:37.151 --> 00:34:40.494]  Every time somebody thinks they're gonna take it down.
[00:34:40.494 --> 00:34:43.656]  Every time there's some nut group that's in competition with their own kind.
[00:34:43.656 --> 00:34:46.378]  Things get bad.
[00:34:46.378 --> 00:34:47.319]  Real bad.
[00:34:47.319 --> 00:34:48.760]  It's always darkest before the dawn.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.843]  Then that human spirit made in the image of God turns on.
[00:34:52.843 --> 00:34:55.485]  And the high voltage.
[00:34:55.485 --> 00:34:56.406]  Switches get flipped.
[00:34:57.526 --> 00:35:14.558]  And those little rat bastards that thought they were going to piss all over the better men and women of this world find out that there were people a lot better than them, a lot smarter than them, who weren't seeking power, but who weren't going to have our heads rubbed in the mud.
[00:35:14.558 --> 00:35:17.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, that which does not kill you only makes you stronger and
[00:35:19.602 --> 00:35:21.363]  We are living in very, very epic times.
[00:35:21.363 --> 00:35:23.264]  I will say this about the big enemy attack.
[00:35:23.264 --> 00:35:32.670]  If you go to CNN.com, I did it this morning, half the stories, I mean I was counting them, I think it was more than half, but it may have changed by now, but were about white people were ignored.
[00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:33.811]  This is why this happened.
[00:35:33.811 --> 00:35:34.731]  White Lash.
[00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:35.852]  Poor whites did this.
[00:35:35.852 --> 00:35:37.293]  Poor whites did that.
[00:35:37.293 --> 00:35:39.074]  Whites, whites, whites, whites, whites, whites.
[00:35:39.074 --> 00:35:40.415]  Minority scared of whites.
[00:35:40.415 --> 00:35:41.796]  Extremism rising.
[00:35:41.796 --> 00:35:43.137]  Hate crimes by whites rising.
[00:35:43.877 --> 00:35:56.306]  They are literally telling Hispanics, Blacks and Asians, you can't have low taxes, you can't have prosperity, you can't have Second Amendment, you can't have a controlled border and security.
[00:35:56.306 --> 00:36:06.913]  They're literally engaged in divide and conquer as we've seen before, but this shows us they're not capitulating to the people's will or to what the market wants or what would make CNN and MSNBC successful.
[00:36:09.153 --> 00:36:13.495]  No, they are going on with what they've done that has brought them to rack and ruin.
[00:36:13.495 --> 00:36:15.476]  So I say, good!
[00:36:15.476 --> 00:36:17.296]  Doesn't matter whether Donald Trump compromises or not.
[00:36:17.296 --> 00:36:18.397]  I don't think he will.
[00:36:18.397 --> 00:36:23.339]  You people are not compromising with the American people.
[00:36:23.339 --> 00:36:26.940]  And so, we are what's driving all of this, and you're done.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:32.503]  So I am very, very positive right now, because pretty much any avenue we go down, you are screwed.
[00:36:32.503 --> 00:36:33.863]  You have no credibility.
[00:36:33.863 --> 00:36:35.004]  You are totally delusional.
[00:36:36.283 --> 00:36:42.171]  And Americans of every race, color, and creed are sick of this crap, and they know what Donald Trump really stands for.
[00:36:42.171 --> 00:36:43.313]  Common sense.
[00:36:43.313 --> 00:36:44.695]  Russia's done nothing to us.
[00:36:44.695 --> 00:36:46.677]  We're not going to have a war with you.
[00:36:46.677 --> 00:36:51.704]  Islamists are running wild in 30 countries, killing people en masse, invading us, saying, kill us.
[00:36:51.704 --> 00:36:52.866]  We're going to blow the hell out of you.
[00:36:54.355 --> 00:36:59.078]  It's the return of common sense, not rocket science.
[00:36:59.078 --> 00:37:12.467]  And all I'm saying to everybody who's been drinking the Kool-Aid of Hillary and all this crap and George Soros, Kennedy, one of the last true Democrats, cut taxes by 50% in the main tax brackets of middle class and poor people, and tax receipts doubled.
[00:37:12.467 --> 00:37:15.429]  Do you get that through your brain?
[00:37:15.429 --> 00:37:18.791]  Reagan increased spending too much with the Democrats, they basically tripled it.
[00:37:18.791 --> 00:37:22.293]  Didn't matter if tax receipts went up 70-something percent, we went into debt.
[00:37:22.293 --> 00:37:22.874]  It was wrong.
[00:37:24.269 --> 00:37:25.752]  It was wrong.
[00:37:25.752 --> 00:37:28.456]  But it's better than the Democrats trying to destroy the damn country.
[00:37:28.456 --> 00:37:30.019]  And they were heavily involved in that.
[00:37:30.019 --> 00:37:31.922]  So just popping in is Roger Stone.
[00:37:33.126 --> 00:37:38.031]  I am so busy with sponsors I've got to take care of, and ads I've got to deal with, and actually running this place.
[00:37:38.031 --> 00:37:39.592]  I've been, for weeks, not even focused on that.
[00:37:39.592 --> 00:37:41.915]  Then I'm going to go off in an hour, and Paul Watson's coming up.
[00:37:41.915 --> 00:37:43.396]  We're going to air a bunch of special reports.
[00:37:43.396 --> 00:37:44.557]  It's going to be very, very powerful.
[00:37:44.557 --> 00:37:51.544]  I'm going to pop in later in the broadcast, but I've just got too much to do, and I've got to do it while I have my early day energy.
[00:37:51.544 --> 00:37:53.306]  So, I'm going to be leaving.
[00:37:53.306 --> 00:37:55.307]  But, big broadcast today.
[00:37:55.307 --> 00:37:57.209]  But I wanted to get Roger to pop in because
[00:37:58.297 --> 00:37:59.498]  I'm very, very positive.
[00:37:59.498 --> 00:38:02.179]  Obviously, Trump's going to have to have some guides into Washington.
[00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:06.080]  I'm very pleased with what Pence has done, delivering the goods on pro-life and so much more.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:06.661]  I trust him.
[00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:11.082]  I don't trust neocons to carry out the president and the people's agenda.
[00:38:11.082 --> 00:38:12.943]  We see some of those folks coming in.
[00:38:12.943 --> 00:38:14.304]  If they fully get behind the agenda,
[00:38:15.416 --> 00:38:16.577]  Side issue.
[00:38:16.577 --> 00:38:20.001]  But regardless, do not go along with Paul Ryan.
[00:38:20.001 --> 00:38:20.522]  Remove him.
[00:38:20.522 --> 00:38:22.605]  He's been caught in WikiLeaks with Hillary.
[00:38:22.605 --> 00:38:24.627]  Pelosi, Reid, their own party wants them out.
[00:38:24.627 --> 00:38:32.957]  Get rid of that old guard establishment that incestuously worked together to screw the people, and get folks in that want a prosperity-driven system.
[00:38:35.168 --> 00:38:38.171]  Trump isn't out to get us, so I haven't really talked to Stone.
[00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:39.232]  I don't know what's on his plate.
[00:38:39.232 --> 00:38:41.414]  I talked to him earlier, so we just pop in for 10 minutes.
[00:38:41.414 --> 00:38:42.194]  You've been in New York.
[00:38:42.194 --> 00:38:47.159]  He's obviously met with the president-elect, but he can't get into that inside baseball.
[00:38:47.159 --> 00:38:51.042]  This is a very exciting time, Roger, and I do want to celebrate now that I've had some sleep.
[00:38:51.042 --> 00:38:52.764]  Congratulations to you, baby.
[00:38:52.764 --> 00:38:53.385]  You're an MVP.
[00:38:54.105 --> 00:38:59.310]  Folks have no idea, like you're the Merlin of this whole deal, behind the scenes helping put King Arthur on the throne.
[00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:13.362]  But I gotta tell you, the superhuman strength of Trump not letting up, feeding off of combat, my God, this is total presidential stuff compared to the scum we've had in the last 20 years.
[00:39:13.362 --> 00:39:16.305]  Well, Alex, first of all, it's great to be back with you.
[00:39:16.305 --> 00:39:19.508]  I spoke to President-elect Trump last night at some length.
[00:39:20.356 --> 00:39:30.464]  On a broad variety of topics, and I'm not really at liberty to discuss that, but let me just say that he is, first of all, very grateful to the InfoWars.com audience.
[00:39:30.464 --> 00:39:34.126]  He knows that you are the centerpiece of the resistance.
[00:39:34.126 --> 00:39:47.837]  He knows that he has gotten better treatment here than from anyone in the mainstream media, and he is very grateful and very thankful for your support and the support
[00:39:48.857 --> 00:39:57.563]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[00:39:57.563 --> 00:39:59.144]  He's got a lot of stuff going on.
[00:39:59.144 --> 00:40:02.626]  In fact, I'm quite embarrassed that he's actually reached out to Artie to say thank you.
[00:40:02.626 --> 00:40:05.088]  I mean, this is crazy what he's doing.
[00:40:05.088 --> 00:40:07.569]  And now I'm told he's working 18 hours a day still.
[00:40:07.569 --> 00:40:09.390]  I'm kind of actually worried about him at 70.
[00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.171]  Is this Superman?
[00:40:11.257 --> 00:40:13.578]  No, look, I told him this.
[00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:17.220]  At the end of the day, he is the one who won this.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:26.064]  His enormously energetic sprint, the final two weeks of this campaign, was almost superhuman.
[00:40:26.064 --> 00:40:34.168]  This reminded me of Harry Truman who jumped on a train and went from one coast to the other doing four stops a day until he could no longer speak.
[00:40:34.668 --> 00:40:35.969]  And pulling out an upset.
[00:40:35.969 --> 00:40:40.473]  Trump put forward a Herculean personal effort here.
[00:40:40.473 --> 00:40:45.498]  And at the end of the day, Alex, I think he won despite his campaign.
[00:40:45.498 --> 00:40:52.263]  By that I mean his campaign, God bless them, they were a grassroots-oriented, guerrilla-oriented operation.
[00:40:52.263 --> 00:40:53.404]  We didn't have the slick
[00:40:54.325 --> 00:41:08.682]  Uh, you know, well-financed operation of the Clintons, but in the end it didn't matter because Trump, Trump's talent, Trump's ability as a communicator, Trump's enunciation of the anti-elitist message.
[00:41:08.682 --> 00:41:09.983]  His instinct.
[00:41:09.983 --> 00:41:11.245]  I've been watching him carefully.
[00:41:11.245 --> 00:41:13.067]  He's got an instinct that is second to none.
[00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:30.374]  Now, the other thing I can tell you is there are many, many people in the political establishment advising him not to allow the prosecution of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, presumably Chelsea Clinton, for their crimes.
[00:41:30.374 --> 00:41:33.217]  I personally think that's an enormous mistake.
[00:41:33.897 --> 00:41:40.780]  Either we are a nation of laws, or we are a nation of men.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.620]  Which is it?
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.721]  There has to be one standard.
[00:41:43.721 --> 00:41:48.703]  If David Petraeus can be prosecuted, then Hillary Clinton must be prosecuted.
[00:41:48.703 --> 00:41:50.463]  Stone, let me jump in here, and I totally agree with you.
[00:41:50.463 --> 00:41:52.324]  My advice to Trump is this.
[00:41:52.324 --> 00:41:53.444]  A, it's what you said you'd do.
[00:41:55.365 --> 00:41:56.966]  It's the right thing to do, Justice.
[00:41:56.966 --> 00:42:01.490]  But see, and most importantly, you cannot leave this den of vipers there.
[00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.211]  They will try to bring you down.
[00:42:03.211 --> 00:42:04.032]  They will never stop.
[00:42:04.032 --> 00:42:06.694]  You must break these people, as you've already done.
[00:42:06.694 --> 00:42:13.279]  The MSM, the Clintons, the minute you go after them, with the law in due process, their minions are all mercs.
[00:42:13.279 --> 00:42:19.084]  They will roll, and we will destroy the entire nest of corruption, and you would have won.
[00:42:19.084 --> 00:42:22.246]  If you don't do it, they're going to be sniping at you the whole time.
[00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:26.449]  He cannot take his foot off their throat.
[00:42:26.449 --> 00:42:27.650]  Not now.
[00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.231]  He's beaten them against enormous odds.
[00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:32.532]  When King David... I'm interrupting again.
[00:42:32.532 --> 00:42:33.473]  You're absolutely on target.
[00:42:33.473 --> 00:42:41.277]  When King David, with that stone, hit Goliath while he was praying, he prayed, God, make me aim true, nobody can beat Goliath.
[00:42:41.277 --> 00:42:42.978]  He only knocked Goliath out.
[00:42:42.978 --> 00:42:48.481]  If he would have hesitated not taking Goliath's sword and chopped his head off, Goliath would have gotten up and strangled him.
[00:42:48.481 --> 00:42:51.303]  King David must raise the sword, correct?
[00:42:52.083 --> 00:42:52.783]  Absolutely.
[00:42:52.783 --> 00:42:58.964]  I think this is why I say Lock Her Up needs to continue to be our watchword.
[00:42:58.964 --> 00:43:00.625]  By the way, you challenged me.
[00:43:00.625 --> 00:43:01.465]  I took away the 2016.
[00:43:01.465 --> 00:43:02.285]  It's over.
[00:43:02.285 --> 00:43:03.725]  I'm announcing we're designing it today.
[00:43:03.725 --> 00:43:04.385]  You're absolutely correct.
[00:43:04.385 --> 00:43:05.086]  We are launching.
[00:43:05.086 --> 00:43:06.006]  It'll be here in one week.
[00:43:06.006 --> 00:43:06.746]  I just did it.
[00:43:06.746 --> 00:43:07.506]  We talked this morning.
[00:43:07.506 --> 00:43:13.027]  We are launching, ladies and gentlemen, the Hillary for Prison 2017 limited edition shirt.
[00:43:13.027 --> 00:43:16.008]  It'll be available by this afternoon in pre-order at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:16.008 --> 00:43:16.308]  Sorry, sir.
[00:43:17.449 --> 00:43:25.017]  We are, I think, at a key point where former Mayor Rudy Giuliani yesterday on Fox summed this up.
[00:43:25.017 --> 00:43:27.360]  This is not a decision for the president.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.722]  This is a decision for the grand jury.
[00:43:29.722 --> 00:43:31.665]  This is a decision for a career
[00:43:32.726 --> 00:43:49.019]  Unbiased, non-political prosecutor to look at the totality of the Clinton Foundation and the pardons and a hundred other issues that the Clintons have enriched themselves by breaking the law and determine whether there is in fact a criminal indictment there.
[00:43:49.019 --> 00:43:55.044]  The other issue here, Alex, is of course the outstanding issue of the 680,000 emails on the Wiener Abidin server.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:22.036]  So when the FBI director says we've reviewed them and there's nothing there, my sources in the Congress, who have seen all of them, my sources in the NYPD, who have seen all of them, tell me that there is open and shut evidence of treason, corruption, sexual exploitation, and worse.
[00:44:22.036 --> 00:44:26.780]  And we have the earlier WikiLeaks where they're with Obama saying, we've got to cover this up, our illegal emails.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.841]  We have them.
[00:44:27.841 --> 00:44:28.421]  We have them.
[00:44:28.421 --> 00:44:30.103]  We have them in gun sights, ready.
[00:44:31.275 --> 00:44:34.337]  So there can be no reprieve here.
[00:44:34.337 --> 00:44:47.725]  This is going to be very important, but I can already see the siren song of the political establishment calling on the president to give the Clintons a pass in order to heal the country and unite.
[00:44:47.725 --> 00:44:49.226]  This is nonsense.
[00:44:49.226 --> 00:44:51.227]  These are asks.
[00:44:51.227 --> 00:44:52.648]  They will bite you.
[00:44:52.648 --> 00:44:53.668]  Here's the good news.
[00:44:53.668 --> 00:44:57.651]  The president can't give a 360 pardon from what I've read in jurisprudence, and so he
[00:44:58.631 --> 00:45:02.054]  Even if Obama gives them one, there's so many thousands of crimes.
[00:45:02.054 --> 00:45:06.637]  Prosecutors afterwards, it doesn't matter, new investigations, new crimes.
[00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:16.063]  Well, I would argue that under the Nixon precedent, Obama could in fact pardon the Clintons for any and all crimes they may have committed.
[00:45:16.063 --> 00:45:19.186]  But, and if that happens, that's a legal process.
[00:45:19.186 --> 00:45:20.967]  But the foundation's an ongoing crime.
[00:45:20.967 --> 00:45:22.248]  The foundation's an ongoing crime.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:28.743]  She still will have accepted a pardon, which is essentially the admission of a crime.
[00:45:28.743 --> 00:45:30.924]  The Clinton Foundation is going to dry up.
[00:45:30.924 --> 00:45:35.306]  Who in God's name would give them a penny to stick in their pockets now?
[00:45:35.306 --> 00:45:36.807]  Who?
[00:45:36.807 --> 00:45:37.127]  I agree.
[00:45:37.127 --> 00:45:38.728]  I mean, thank you, Roger, for coming on.
[00:45:38.728 --> 00:45:40.729]  Any other points that are key to add?
[00:45:40.729 --> 00:45:42.410]  Listen, nobody's perfect.
[00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:43.311]  This is so complex.
[00:45:43.311 --> 00:45:44.772]  I can't believe he's working 18 hours a day.
[00:45:44.772 --> 00:45:46.492]  I'm so impressed.
[00:45:46.492 --> 00:45:48.854]  People, the media is going to try to, here's the new attack.
[00:45:49.622 --> 00:45:53.065]  They're going to now attack us on our strength, liberty, and the fact that we don't falter or waver.
[00:45:53.065 --> 00:45:55.427]  They're going to claim he isn't 100% delivering.
[00:45:55.427 --> 00:45:57.609]  We have to wait and see and give him time to even get in.
[00:45:57.609 --> 00:46:00.431]  We have to worry about assassination, which the media is pushing.
[00:46:00.431 --> 00:46:04.395]  So don't let them start claiming, oh, he's bringing in neocons, or oh, he's doing that.
[00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:06.657]  Donald's shown he does what he wants.
[00:46:06.657 --> 00:46:07.418]  The point is,
[00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:14.942]  It's delivering, building the wall, cutting the taxes, standing back and letting prosecution take place.
[00:46:14.942 --> 00:46:16.984]  That's what we're waiting for once he's president.
[00:46:16.984 --> 00:46:24.568]  In the next 70 days, total defense of Trump, absolute promotion of what he pushes for, and keep fighting.
[00:46:24.568 --> 00:46:26.430]  Keep fighting and exposing MSM.
[00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:30.132]  Wasn't it genius to ignore the press corps and not tell them where he was going or what he was doing?
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:36.084]  Yeah, I think CNN is going to have a very hard time getting him on the phone.
[00:46:36.084 --> 00:46:40.667]  I think the New York Times is going to have a very hard time getting him on the phone.
[00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:42.749]  I think he's wise to ignore them.
[00:46:42.749 --> 00:46:54.938]  But, Alex, let me also say, any of the names you see floated out there for various positions, whether it's Chris Christie or Rudy Giuliani or Jamie Dimon for Treasury.
[00:46:54.938 --> 00:46:55.979]  It's all bull.
[00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:56.459]  It's all bull.
[00:46:56.459 --> 00:46:58.721]  There's the worst idea I've ever heard in my entire life.
[00:46:59.471 --> 00:47:01.213]  It's all self, not, that's not true.
[00:47:01.213 --> 00:47:04.876]  It is self-promotion in most cases.
[00:47:04.876 --> 00:47:06.737]  You should not read anything into that.
[00:47:06.737 --> 00:47:07.878]  No decisions are made.
[00:47:07.878 --> 00:47:09.419]  No lists are made.
[00:47:09.419 --> 00:47:11.061]  It's wildly premature.
[00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:22.710]  So when the Washington Post reports a piece by Robert Costa saying that Corey Lewandowski is under consideration for Chief of Staff, no he is not.
[00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.012]  That's a plant.
[00:47:24.012 --> 00:47:25.413]  That is not true.
[00:47:25.413 --> 00:47:26.654]  There is zero chance.
[00:47:26.994 --> 00:47:27.695]  That that will happen.
[00:47:27.695 --> 00:47:28.155]  That's right.
[00:47:28.155 --> 00:47:32.558]  Lewandowski is now a CNN turncoat operative.
[00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:41.184]  Well, this is the same guy who planted a fake story at the Washington Post that he was in charge of the vice presidential selection process, which he was not.
[00:47:41.184 --> 00:47:43.846]  So, you see a lot of self-promotion.
[00:47:43.846 --> 00:47:48.409]  You see the Washington rats all trying to board the ship.
[00:47:48.409 --> 00:47:51.932]  The watchword today is, I was with you the whole time.
[00:47:51.932 --> 00:47:54.554]  Anybody who says that was not with you the whole time.
[00:47:55.414 --> 00:47:58.815]  Well, my listeners were with the fact that Trump was a patriot and the elite were against him.
[00:47:58.815 --> 00:48:03.136]  And I was a little fly on the wall in the meeting where what really brought down Lewandowski came out.
[00:48:03.136 --> 00:48:05.837]  And I knew Lewandowski was going down, so I know the inside baseball.
[00:48:05.837 --> 00:48:07.957]  And it's not some pissing contest with Lewandowski.
[00:48:07.957 --> 00:48:09.778]  He's really a bad person.
[00:48:09.778 --> 00:48:12.058]  And I want to salute the individual that helped bring him down.
[00:48:12.058 --> 00:48:16.799]  And just, you know, thank God there's patriots around Trump protecting him.
[00:48:16.799 --> 00:48:22.140]  And listen, nobody's smart enough or has enough eyeballs or brain cells to keep track of something this complex.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.581]  The fact is the enemy hates Trump.
[00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:29.484]  That's why you know he's good, and we're going to give him massive benefit of the doubt until he gets into office.
[00:48:29.484 --> 00:48:35.549]  But remember, folks, the number one threat from my gut, and you see him in the news, is them trying to kill Trump.
[00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:38.711]  Don't you agree, Roger, that's the maximum threat right now?
[00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:41.472]  Look, I pray for his security.
[00:48:41.472 --> 00:48:44.735]  I've written a book on the Kennedy assassination.
[00:48:44.735 --> 00:48:51.759]  I wrote a book on the Bushes, which has what I think is the true story of the attempted Reagan assassination.
[00:48:55.262 --> 00:49:00.825]  Inappropriate actions of the Secret Service in both of those instances give me pause.
[00:49:00.825 --> 00:49:09.849]  Now, I think the men and women of the Secret Service are brave, loyal Americans, but I worry about the political manipulators above them.
[00:49:09.849 --> 00:49:15.913]  So, yes, I pray every day for the President's security, the assassination threats,
[00:49:17.273 --> 00:49:20.915]  You know, are ubiquitous across the social media.
[00:49:20.915 --> 00:49:31.078]  I myself, and I know this is probably true of you, I've gotten more death threats in the last 48 hours than I've gotten in the last 48 years.
[00:49:31.078 --> 00:49:34.059]  And I'm about 48 years old, so... Well, let's talk about this then.
[00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:35.420]  I know you've got to go, and I've got to go.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.640]  I'm skipping the break.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.941]  RogerStone, StoneZone.com, StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:40.762]  Let me ask this question.
[00:49:42.042 --> 00:49:49.065]  A little bird told me that Trump, a year ago, envisioned he was going to win, understood the people, knew the mainstream media was a joke.
[00:49:49.065 --> 00:49:51.786]  He advertises around the country, he learns it has no response anymore.
[00:49:51.786 --> 00:49:53.046]  There's nothing there.
[00:49:53.046 --> 00:49:54.967]  You advertise in independent media, there's a huge response.
[00:49:54.967 --> 00:49:56.968]  You advertise in mainstream, no response.
[00:49:56.968 --> 00:49:57.648]  I mean, Trump's a smart guy.
[00:49:57.648 --> 00:50:00.269]  He's like, well, they have no power for six, seven years.
[00:50:00.269 --> 00:50:02.890]  I advertise, nothing happens, you know?
[00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.471]  I mean, that's one thing for Trump, just as a businessman, to get.
[00:50:05.471 --> 00:50:05.891]  They're done.
[00:50:07.196 --> 00:50:08.157]  This is our country.
[00:50:08.157 --> 00:50:09.477]  This is foreign run.
[00:50:09.477 --> 00:50:12.099]  This whole Soros thing, the globalists, the big banks, they admit it.
[00:50:12.099 --> 00:50:13.640]  It's come out in the WikiLeaks.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:23.265]  And a little bird told me if they think they're going to try to start a war or finance too many riots in the streets or try to burn Washington or something, that we're just going to encamp the U.S.
[00:50:23.265 --> 00:50:24.806]  Army and the Marines
[00:50:25.686 --> 00:50:36.355]  Around the White House, and somebody's gonna sit in a bunker and sign the executive orders, and if Congress wants to roll over to the globals, that's fine, but we finally got a president that's gonna try to defeat the enemies that have captured this nation.
[00:50:36.355 --> 00:50:38.417]  I mean, we have the beachhead now, is what I'm saying.
[00:50:38.417 --> 00:50:41.940]  He has captured the White House, now he's gotta capture D.C.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:42.901]  and bring the country back.
[00:50:42.901 --> 00:50:44.122]  That's how epic this is.
[00:50:45.411 --> 00:50:46.412]  I generally agree.
[00:50:46.412 --> 00:50:50.135]  I think that their moves will be more subtle than that, Alex.
[00:50:50.135 --> 00:51:05.066]  I think there's going to be a major effort to continue to crack down on the lending ability of community banks in a purposeful effort to slow the economy so that can be blamed on Trump.
[00:51:05.066 --> 00:51:08.048]  They want to crash the economy and blame it on Trump.
[00:51:08.048 --> 00:51:08.568]  Oh, I agree.
[00:51:08.568 --> 00:51:09.789]  So what does Trump do?
[00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:14.153]  He gets up in 70 days and points out with his bully pulpit what they're doing to crash it before he gets in?
[00:51:14.813 --> 00:51:34.592]  Yes, he tells his Treasury Secretary to get with the community banks and make sure, since they are credit worthy, since they are loaded with cash, that they are lending to people who want to build... And let's be clear, under Obama, in the last eight years, almost nothing to locals, trillions to foreign banks, trillions to China, nothing for us.
[00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:39.057]  Trump needs to say, you give the damn loans to local people, including black communities,
[00:51:39.517 --> 00:51:40.358]  Right now!
[00:51:40.358 --> 00:51:43.359]  And the Hispanic communities, and the poor communities, now!
[00:51:43.359 --> 00:51:46.881]  You give them the loans, they pay them back, you do it right now!
[00:51:46.881 --> 00:51:57.908]  Warren, I happen to know that the President-elect is looking at some innovative financing options where you could rebuild our infrastructure without using tax dollars.
[00:51:59.292 --> 00:52:11.840]  I mean, this can be done where you can essentially get a guaranteed line of credit to rebuild America without squandering... Sure, all that matters is tax cuts and confidence.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.722]  This country can't be held down.
[00:52:13.722 --> 00:52:17.044]  The Federal Reserve used to admit, we're overheating, we've got to suppress it.
[00:52:17.044 --> 00:52:18.045]  That's the big secret.
[00:52:18.045 --> 00:52:18.825]  Trump knows that.
[00:52:18.825 --> 00:52:22.668]  Just turn a few switches, block the globalists, we're going to win, right, Rogers?
[00:52:22.668 --> 00:52:23.928]  I think that's exactly right.
[00:52:23.928 --> 00:52:26.450]  Look, I think he's going to move towards a sound dollar.
[00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:29.052]  I think he's going to move to growth-oriented
[00:52:29.872 --> 00:52:32.674]  Is that why the stock market went up?
[00:52:32.674 --> 00:52:33.654]  I noticed that.
[00:52:33.654 --> 00:52:35.255]  I noticed that.
[00:52:35.255 --> 00:52:38.797]  Barry, Barry, because look, we have a businessman in charge.
[00:52:38.797 --> 00:52:41.779]  He understands the economy and he knows how to create jobs.
[00:52:41.779 --> 00:52:44.280]  I've never been more confident.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.922]  Why don't you make a Wall Street Channing locker up, my friend?
[00:52:48.601 --> 00:52:50.863]  Yes, well, we'll get there.
[00:52:50.863 --> 00:52:55.468]  I think it's vitally important that he keep his pledge to the American people on those questions.
[00:52:55.468 --> 00:53:01.794]  All right, Alex, I'm going back over to Trump Tower, but great to be with you again, and I will keep you posted.
[00:53:01.794 --> 00:53:03.575]  There goes Roger Stone, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:03.575 --> 00:53:06.878]  Very exciting times to be alive, I tell you.
[00:53:06.878 --> 00:53:09.781]  StoneColdTruth.com, AlexJonesTheForce.com.
[00:53:09.781 --> 00:53:11.443]  I've done 53 minutes of this broadcast.
[00:53:13.035 --> 00:53:15.297]  And I've not once even sat here and said, support us.
[00:53:15.297 --> 00:53:20.021]  And that's why I've got to go off air here, because I've got ads for advertisers to cut that are a month behind.
[00:53:20.021 --> 00:53:25.046]  I've got bills to pay, contracts to sign, satellite deals.
[00:53:25.046 --> 00:53:27.168]  I mean, I've got a lot of crap going on, a lot of good stuff.
[00:53:27.168 --> 00:53:30.131]  But I mean, by the time I sit on air until three or four, I'm like a zombie.
[00:53:30.131 --> 00:53:31.432]  I can't make these business decisions.
[00:53:33.027 --> 00:53:37.754]  I can still do radio and TV forever, but when it comes to business, I've got to really figure out how to fund this thing.
[00:53:37.754 --> 00:53:43.082]  So I want to just encourage everybody, if you want to see the main attack ship in this fight,
[00:53:44.653 --> 00:53:49.636]  Turn into three or four ships and really run the tables on these people.
[00:53:49.636 --> 00:53:53.359]  We've got amazing products everybody needs at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:53:53.359 --> 00:53:56.141]  We've got free shipping throughout at least a day or tomorrow.
[00:53:56.141 --> 00:53:57.982]  We're selling out of so much stuff.
[00:53:57.982 --> 00:54:02.565]  I didn't order enough stuff thinking the sale wouldn't be that big, so it's going to have to end one way or the other.
[00:54:02.565 --> 00:54:03.585]  But take advantage of it.
[00:54:03.585 --> 00:54:04.626]  Free shipping store-wide.

[00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:11.251]  Wow, that's a big deal.

[00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:18.290]  That's a big deal.
[00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:19.871]  We just extended that out.
[00:54:19.871 --> 00:54:24.916]  Our great supplier, My Patriot Supply, has decided to do that because they're so excited as well.
[00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:27.819]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main site.
[00:54:27.819 --> 00:54:35.086]  Sub-sites, you go to the nutraceuticals or supplements to get your probiotics, your vitamin, mineral fusion, fruit punch, your bio PCA for the hair and nails.
[00:54:35.766 --> 00:54:37.407]  Knockout sold out.
[00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:38.127]  They told me it was sold out.
[00:54:38.127 --> 00:54:39.208]  It's still up there.
[00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:46.132]  The BioTrue Selenium, Liver Cleanze, Oxy Powder, Prostate Guard, AnthroPlex, it's just the dry version of the Super Metal Vitality.
[00:54:46.132 --> 00:54:47.372]  It's all there.
[00:54:47.372 --> 00:54:51.054]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:51.115]  888-253-3139.
[00:54:51.115 --> 00:54:53.056]  And that runs right through the weekend.
[00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:54.396]  So again, to all the viewers out there,
[00:55:01.593 --> 00:55:10.841]  If you want to be part of the next level of the take back of America and the world for free market, true open societies.
[00:55:10.841 --> 00:55:14.184]  Notice Soros names his group the Open Society because he's the opposite.
[00:55:14.184 --> 00:55:15.505]  This is the real renaissance.
[00:55:15.505 --> 00:55:16.666]  This is the real freedom.
[00:55:16.666 --> 00:55:18.888]  We've broken the back of the enemy.
[00:55:18.888 --> 00:55:21.530]  We have taken action to the next level.
[00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:23.952]  History is unfolding now.
[00:55:23.952 --> 00:55:26.714]  And it is not corporate sponsorship that funded this.
[00:55:26.714 --> 00:55:29.457]  It was you, the listeners and viewers, that took action.
[00:55:30.322 --> 00:55:31.643]  So I want to encourage you.
[00:55:31.643 --> 00:55:38.368]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and take advantage of store-wide free shipping at least for the next 24 hours.
[00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:48.996]  And while supplies last, 30-40% off products across the board like non-GMO heirloom seeds, water filtration systems, super cutting-edge supplements.
[00:55:50.202 --> 00:55:53.243]  Storeable foods and so much more on apparel.
[00:55:53.243 --> 00:55:57.304]  It's 50 to 15 percent off depending on which piece of apparel it is.
[00:55:57.304 --> 00:56:03.146]  Because I do the Made in America thing and we make almost nothing on that because it costs so much to do because of how unfair things are.
[00:56:03.146 --> 00:56:07.747]  So we can't go more than 15 percent on Made in America because we're only making like 30 percent on it.
[00:56:07.747 --> 00:56:12.648]  Made in Mexico, made in Venezuela, made in wherever, places like Honduras.
[00:56:12.648 --> 00:56:15.449]  Yeah, we can give it 50 percent off on that because it costs five bucks.
[00:56:16.277 --> 00:56:18.518]  Made in America, $12, $13.
[00:56:18.518 --> 00:56:20.618]  Some of the more designer stuff, $25.
[00:56:20.618 --> 00:56:22.138]  But it's all there.
[00:56:22.138 --> 00:56:28.380]  Infowarsstore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.701]  I'll be doing a special broadcast tomorrow.
[00:56:30.701 --> 00:56:33.381]  I'll be obviously back to Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:56:33.381 --> 00:56:37.482]  We've got a bunch of compilations of the best of the last week coming up in the next hour.
[00:56:37.482 --> 00:56:39.323]  Clips of my famous interview with Donald Trump.
[00:56:40.333 --> 00:56:41.994]  Because he kept all his promises.
[00:56:41.994 --> 00:56:42.894]  I will not disappoint you.
[00:56:42.894 --> 00:56:43.834]  Boy, didn't he?
[00:56:43.834 --> 00:56:46.375]  He did absolutely deliver.
[00:56:46.375 --> 00:56:53.078]  And then Paul Watson, the absolute Arthurian warrior from all beyond, will be joining us.
[00:56:53.078 --> 00:57:04.242]  And then we are also going to have a big excerpt, big analyses of the secret of why Trump won, hasn't aired yet, shot it last night, the threat against his life, what's happening there, and so much more.
[00:57:04.242 --> 00:57:05.863]  That's going to air in the fourth hour with David Knight.
[00:57:06.343 --> 00:57:14.069]  Hosting about 20-30 minutes of it will be breaking news and analysis, but a lot of it will be tapes I shot last night while I was on fire.
[00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:15.911]  It's all up on Infowars.com.
[00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:18.053]  Will they kill Trump before the inauguration?
[00:57:18.053 --> 00:57:18.833]  I said that last night.
[00:57:18.833 --> 00:57:21.555]  There was just a flotilla of articles today saying kill him!
[00:57:22.236 --> 00:57:23.417]  Kill him now!
[00:57:23.417 --> 00:57:26.981]  So this is the crazy town level to which we've reached.
[00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:29.783]  But we haven't gotten to the riots all over the country.
[00:57:29.783 --> 00:57:33.147]  The story linked on DrugsReport.com is an info war story.
[00:57:33.147 --> 00:57:37.791]  High school girl viciously attacked for supporting Donald Trump by black folks.
[00:57:37.791 --> 00:57:39.853]  This is just attacks all over the country.
[00:57:39.853 --> 00:57:43.297]  You go to CNN though, it's white people are attacking black people.
[00:57:44.005 --> 00:57:48.729]  And that means some operative of the government burned a one-foot cross in somebody's yard, totally made up.
[00:57:48.729 --> 00:57:51.051]  All the church burnings are out to be fake.
[00:57:51.051 --> 00:57:53.232]  The black stripper being raped by the lacrosse team, fake.
[00:57:53.232 --> 00:57:55.274]  It's all finance, it's all fake.
[00:57:55.274 --> 00:57:57.756]  I mean, if it was real, I'd report it.
[00:57:57.756 --> 00:58:01.699]  Let's say this, it's as rare as finding an Easter Bunny at Christmas, okay?
[00:58:01.699 --> 00:58:04.862]  Because most white people are in a catatonic state, totally guilty.
[00:58:04.862 --> 00:58:09.185]  Back when the Klan was running around doing bad stuff, it was like 2% of the population in the South.
[00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:11.087]  I mean, just face it, folks.
[00:58:12.125 --> 00:58:17.968]  When you're walking down an alley at night in a minority neighborhood, you see a white guy, are you afraid you're gonna get attacked?
[00:58:17.968 --> 00:58:20.168]  It's because statistically it's not happening.
[00:58:20.168 --> 00:58:21.829]  And it's happening everywhere, they admit it.
[00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:26.071]  It's like a hundred and something times more likely for a white to be attacked by a black person.
[00:58:26.071 --> 00:58:29.392]  And it's a minority of blacks doing it, but still, crime's rare.
[00:58:29.392 --> 00:58:32.994]  But in that group, the media sells it like it's okay.
[00:58:32.994 --> 00:58:36.856]  Just like in the 50s, most racial attacks were the KKK against blacks.
[00:58:36.856 --> 00:58:38.536]  Because it was culturally acceptable.
[00:58:38.536 --> 00:58:39.777]  We have to make it unacceptable.
[00:58:40.871 --> 00:58:41.392]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.392 --> 00:58:42.575]  InfoWars.com.
[00:58:42.575 --> 00:58:43.177]  Spread the word.
[00:58:43.177 --> 00:58:44.340]  They hate that site.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.342]  That you've been spreading it.
[00:58:45.342 --> 00:58:46.285]  It's been destroying them.
[00:58:50.504 --> 00:58:52.805]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:58:52.805 --> 00:58:54.366]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[00:59:11.176 --> 00:59:11.896]  The reality is

[00:59:52.757 --> 00:59:55.359]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.422 --> 01:00:05.243]  We are on the march.
[01:00:05.243 --> 01:00:08.385]  The empire is on the run.
[01:00:08.385 --> 01:00:14.209]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.209 --> 01:00:16.230]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:18.872]  Bunch of special reports coming up.
[01:00:18.872 --> 01:00:21.273]  Donald Trump in the next segment.
[01:00:21.273 --> 01:00:25.936]  But, I wanted to mention this because it's so sea change.
[01:00:25.936 --> 01:00:26.596]  Unacceptable!
[01:00:26.596 --> 01:00:30.539]  Wolf Blitzer rebukes Trump for breaches in press protocol.
[01:00:32.148 --> 01:00:35.812]  He just said how horrible it is, that it's unacceptable.
[01:00:35.812 --> 01:00:36.853]  They have to fix it.
[01:00:36.853 --> 01:00:46.945]  The White House Correspondents Association deeply concerned that he isn't telling them everywhere he goes and what he does so they can sycophantically run around behind him.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:52.603]  This is a bunch of arrogant nobodies from bad families on average, literally.
[01:00:52.603 --> 01:01:03.371]  I don't know why it is, like you research these journals, they just have horrible families, horrible people, no success, just the sons and daughters of con artists, criminals, murderers, filth, trash, garbage, just you name it.
[01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:04.671]  This is true.
[01:01:04.671 --> 01:01:05.372]  They don't build anything.
[01:01:05.372 --> 01:01:07.872]  They just parasite around, butt kiss around.
[01:01:07.872 --> 01:01:09.973]  They're just saying, how dare you ignore us in D.C.
[01:01:09.973 --> 01:01:11.474]  and then fly off back to New York?
[01:01:11.474 --> 01:01:12.654]  Wonderful!
[01:01:12.654 --> 01:01:14.075]  Wonderful!
[01:01:14.075 --> 01:01:16.235]  That's how you help collapse them.
[01:01:16.235 --> 01:01:20.497]  Only Trump's glow giving them energy can keep these vampires alive.
[01:01:20.497 --> 01:01:24.818]  They're like, how dare you not let us suck your blood?
[01:01:24.818 --> 01:01:25.679]  He doesn't need them.
[01:01:25.679 --> 01:01:27.419]  They're not going to turn to his side.
[01:01:27.419 --> 01:01:28.820]  So this is a really juicy thing.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:29.160]  Here it is.
[01:01:32.639 --> 01:01:36.582]  Going to have to get accustomed to some norms that are in place here in Washington.
[01:01:36.582 --> 01:01:49.393]  Donald Trump, we're told by an aide, left Washington earlier this afternoon, got on his plane, returned to New York City without any reporters being told that the President-elect was leaving Washington.
[01:01:49.753 --> 01:01:51.173]  I love how he's in a tower.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.340]  It's like under siege.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.481]  He gets it.
[01:02:12.481 --> 01:02:23.804]  Because these are the people that lied, said he could never win, said that he couldn't have the nomination, then said they could steal it, then said he didn't deserve the money he raised.
[01:02:23.804 --> 01:02:32.187]  They were wrong about everything on every front and backstabbed time and time and time and time and time again.
[01:02:32.187 --> 01:02:39.369]  And then now we're just supposed to keep groveling because they've got a big TV station and guys in trench coats and scarves looking official.
[01:02:40.486 --> 01:02:44.428]  When they'd sell their mother out for a stick of bubble gum.
[01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:46.028]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time.
[01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:46.448]  And you did it.
[01:02:46.448 --> 01:02:49.290]  I wanted 100 million views over election.
[01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:51.070]  We only had 90 million.
[01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.191]  I'll take it.
[01:02:52.191 --> 01:02:54.212]  God bless you, you did an incredible job.
[01:02:54.212 --> 01:02:56.473]  Rubbing it in their faces.
[01:02:56.473 --> 01:03:00.114]  Outside of our terrestrial radio audience that's now 5 million a day, conservatively.
[01:03:00.114 --> 01:03:01.955]  That's very conservative.
[01:03:01.955 --> 01:03:03.976]  We can say, we're bigger than Rush Limbaugh.
[01:03:03.976 --> 01:03:06.957]  We're now the biggest broadcast transmission there is.
[01:03:06.957 --> 01:03:08.778]  Roger's the biggest website.
[01:03:08.778 --> 01:03:09.018]  Love it.
[01:03:10.367 --> 01:03:11.328]  It's not about who's the biggest.
[01:03:11.328 --> 01:03:13.929]  The point is that our message of freedom is the most popular.
[01:03:13.929 --> 01:03:22.956]  And that's why now if you will actually convert the listenership to supporting us, you'll see this grow just like we promised you on TV and radio and dominating and taking America back.
[01:03:22.956 --> 01:03:24.016]  We've got the beachhead now.
[01:03:24.016 --> 01:03:33.563]  If you'll support us, buy your war bonds, become a PrisonPlanet.tv member, go get the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app or app.

[01:04:06.734 --> 01:04:07.235]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.011]  Has a link to it as well.
[01:04:13.011 --> 01:04:15.112]  Infowars.com forward slash app.
[01:04:15.112 --> 01:04:16.192]  This is the new media.
[01:04:16.192 --> 01:04:23.456]  This is like a new YouTube because we've already got like 15 people on there that can upload videos and original articles and content.
[01:04:23.456 --> 01:04:26.138]  We're going to start adding people like Millie Weaver, one of our great reporters.
[01:04:26.138 --> 01:04:33.481]  We're going to add other reporters that we've had here in the past and correspondents and other people that want to reach out to our audience.
[01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:34.242]  And then we're going to take
[01:04:34.722 --> 01:04:41.747]  The most powerful reports off that and put them on our Facebook, put them on our YouTube, put them on this broadcast and just magnify all of that.
[01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:46.110]  I want to get hundreds of correspondents across the country who are with an iPhone or a Droid.
[01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:53.896]  They have the power of a network that can't be censored by Google or Facebook and upload or stream live to reach the world.
[01:04:53.896 --> 01:04:55.237]  And it's got community.
[01:04:55.237 --> 01:04:57.258]  We're going to add a lot more to it.
[01:04:57.258 --> 01:04:58.499]  Check it out at Infowars.com.
[01:05:00.902 --> 01:05:06.048]  Three days after the election of Donald Trump and the reality of a Trump presidency is starting to hit home.
[01:05:06.048 --> 01:05:11.454]  For some people this is such a devastating notion that they need to call an ambulance or even want to die.
[01:05:11.454 --> 01:05:15.358]  Well we Trump voters care about our fellow Americans and we're paying by this.
[01:05:15.358 --> 01:05:15.839]  So let's help
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.842]  Let's try to help them recover from their devastation.
[01:05:19.842 --> 01:05:25.066]  If you see a Trump protester or a group of them, give them a diaper, hand them a binky, cover them in a blankie.
[01:05:25.066 --> 01:05:27.508]  After all, this is what you do for crying babies.
[01:05:27.508 --> 01:05:31.291]  Many of these people look like they need a hug, so give them a box of huggies.
[01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:38.877]  We Trump voters can't stand to see our fellow Americans so depleted, so we will make sure to get as many of them a warm bottle of milk as possible.
[01:05:38.877 --> 01:05:45.062]  To make America great again, we must make sure that these babies are taken care of with plenty of diapers, binkies, and rattles.
[01:05:45.362 --> 01:05:46.945]  Don't worry, Trump protesters.
[01:05:46.945 --> 01:05:50.551]  Remember, we're stronger together, even if you do have to wear a diaper.
[01:05:50.551 --> 01:05:53.837]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[01:05:53.837 --> 01:05:55.300]  This message is paid for by the Russians.
[01:06:00.006 --> 01:06:09.351]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid.
[01:06:09.351 --> 01:06:12.252]  The potential for power grid chaos.
[01:06:12.252 --> 01:06:20.416]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[01:06:20.416 --> 01:06:23.358]  My friends, chaos is already here, and it's gonna get a lot worse.
[01:06:23.618 --> 01:06:29.682]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[01:06:29.682 --> 01:06:33.585]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house.
[01:06:33.585 --> 01:06:35.466]  The Solutions from Science system.

[01:07:32.467 --> 01:07:36.029]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:45.156]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces who are trying to sway public opinion and in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[01:07:45.156 --> 01:07:50.181]  But InfoWars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[01:08:10.652 --> 01:08:29.107]  Donald Trump again joins us, and I've got so many questions, but first off, Donald, thank you for joining us.
[01:08:29.107 --> 01:08:30.188]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:30.188 --> 01:08:30.668]  Great.
[01:08:30.668 --> 01:08:31.389]  Great to be with you.
[01:08:32.552 --> 01:08:43.577]  I've got so many questions, but you are vindicated, this has got to be the 50th time in the last six months, on the radical Muslims celebrating, not just in New Jersey, but New York, Palestine, all over.
[01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:44.318]  What do you have to say?
[01:08:44.318 --> 01:08:52.762]  They're still attacking you, though we've got Dan Rather on video, we've got New York Post, we've got Washington Post, we've got... I mean, what's going on here?
[01:08:53.484 --> 01:09:00.749]  Well, I took a lot of heat and I was very strong on it and I held my line and then all of a sudden, you know, hundreds of people were calling up my office.
[01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:07.013]  I was the other day in Sarasota, Florida and people are in line and we had 12,000 people, which is fantastic.
[01:09:07.013 --> 01:09:10.655]  And the people were saying, many of the people from New Jersey, four or five people said,
[01:09:11.115 --> 01:09:12.736]  Mr. Trump, I saw it myself.
[01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:13.316]  I was there.
[01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.857]  They talked about Patterson.
[01:09:14.857 --> 01:09:16.657]  But they said, I saw it myself, Mr. Trump.
[01:09:16.657 --> 01:09:17.778]  I was there.
[01:09:17.778 --> 01:09:23.060]  So many people have called in, and on Twitter, at real Donald Trump, they're all tweeting.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:28.723]  So I knew it happened, and I held my line, and people wanted me to apologize, and we can't do that.
[01:09:28.723 --> 01:09:30.784]  People like you and I can't do that so easily.
[01:09:30.784 --> 01:09:32.745]  Now, we can do it if we're wrong, Alex.
[01:09:32.745 --> 01:09:33.525]  You apologize.
[01:09:33.525 --> 01:09:34.785]  I'd apologize if I was wrong.
[01:09:34.785 --> 01:09:39.187]  But they were celebrating, and they were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center.
[01:09:39.187 --> 01:09:40.328]  I think that's disgraceful.
[01:09:41.272 --> 01:09:41.732]  It is.
[01:09:41.732 --> 01:09:56.337]  And that same week you were reporting on that fact, we had two different international football games, soccer games, with the Turkish fans and others during the moment of silence for the dead people in Paris chanting Allah Akbar and booing.
[01:09:56.337 --> 01:09:57.778]  So did that not happen too?
[01:09:58.738 --> 01:10:00.399]  Well, that happened and everybody saw it.
[01:10:00.399 --> 01:10:03.760]  That was a week ago and the players were out on the field and they couldn't believe it.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.440]  They were embarrassed.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.340]  They didn't know what to do.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:08.261]  The coach and the managers, they all apologized, but it happened.
[01:10:08.261 --> 01:10:10.682]  Look, we have to deal with reality.
[01:10:10.682 --> 01:10:13.722]  And you know, it all started because they said, we need surveillance.
[01:10:13.722 --> 01:10:15.083]  We need proper surveillance.
[01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:22.325]  We have people that truly are evil and they're coming from someplace and you know sort of where they're coming from, at least the vicinity.
[01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:26.766]  And I said, we need proper surveillance, whether it's a mosque or any place else.
[01:10:26.766 --> 01:10:32.348]  We have to be surveilled and we have to see what's coming at us because we're not going to have a country anymore.
[01:10:32.348 --> 01:10:38.710]  Between the weak borders that we have, the pathetic and weak borders where politicians are afraid to do anything about it.
[01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:43.291]  Between all of what's happening with radical, you know, you look at what's going on.
[01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:48.653]  You have a president that doesn't even want to talk about, you know, the radical Muslim stuff.
[01:10:48.653 --> 01:10:49.874]  He doesn't want to mention the word.
[01:10:49.874 --> 01:10:51.094]  He doesn't want to say it.
[01:10:51.554 --> 01:11:01.086]  But you look at what's happening where we have a president that's over there celebrating global warming and trying to get everybody excited about global warming, like that's our number one problem.
[01:11:01.086 --> 01:11:03.769]  He considers that to be our number one problem.
[01:11:03.769 --> 01:11:08.415]  And our number one problem is what's going on where they want to blow up our cities and they want to blow up our country.
[01:11:08.415 --> 01:11:09.677]  That's our number one problem.
[01:11:10.237 --> 01:11:16.239]  You said months ago, bomb the oil of ISIS and the mainstream media laughed because you said the sky was blue again.
[01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:19.460]  Now the Pentagon says that's the right thing to do.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:27.102]  And now you've come out saying, quote, it looks like that Turkey's on the side of ISIS, close quote.
[01:11:27.102 --> 01:11:32.103]  Well, the next day the Russians released satellite photos documenting that there are literally
[01:11:32.703 --> 01:11:42.774]  Thousands of trucks coming up to the border at these huge terminals connected to Irgun, the president's son, making billions of dollars total off of this.
[01:11:42.774 --> 01:11:44.896]  Again, you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue.
[01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:47.604]  Well, I was right about that.
[01:11:47.604 --> 01:12:00.473]  I was right in saying in a book that I wrote, you covered it really nicely, I appreciate it, but I wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000, The America We Deserve, and I said in that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama Bin Laden.
[01:12:00.473 --> 01:12:09.259]  I mean, I really study this stuff, I really find it very interesting, and even though I'm a business fan, I find it, I've always found, I've always been involved in politics.
[01:12:09.259 --> 01:12:11.781]  I said, we better be careful with Osama Bin Laden.
[01:12:11.781 --> 01:12:14.603]  There's a guy named Osama Bin Laden, nobody really knew who he was, but
[01:12:15.023 --> 01:12:15.823]  He was nasty.
[01:12:15.823 --> 01:12:20.266]  He was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it.
[01:12:20.266 --> 01:12:24.888]  And I wrote in the book, 2000, two years before the World Trade Center came down, I talked about Osama bin Laden.
[01:12:24.888 --> 01:12:25.809]  You better take him out.
[01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:27.650]  I said, he's going to crawl under a rock.
[01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:29.311]  You better take him out.
[01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:30.771]  And now people are seeing that.
[01:12:30.771 --> 01:12:34.954]  They're saying, you know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden, which actually is true.
[01:12:34.954 --> 01:12:38.516]  And then two years later, a year and a half later, he knocked down the World Trade Center.
[01:12:38.516 --> 01:12:42.218]  And I talked about terrorism and that that was before terrorism as we know it today.
[01:12:42.218 --> 01:12:42.498]  I said,
[01:12:43.098 --> 01:12:43.899]  We better be careful.
[01:12:43.899 --> 01:12:44.579]  That's going to happen.
[01:12:44.579 --> 01:12:45.480]  It's going to be a big thing.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.701]  And it certainly is a big thing.
[01:12:46.701 --> 01:12:55.289]  So with the oil, and I'm glad you brought it up, but as you know, for three years, I've been saying you better take out the oil because if you don't take the oil, it's going to be a problem.
[01:12:55.289 --> 01:12:56.830]  So we shouldn't have been in Iraq.
[01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:01.895]  But once we got there, the way Osama, the way we came out was horrible.
[01:13:01.895 --> 01:13:03.456]  And I said, take the oil.
[01:13:03.456 --> 01:13:04.638]  Then we didn't take the oil.
[01:13:04.638 --> 01:13:05.919]  So ISIS got the oil.
[01:13:05.919 --> 01:13:09.262]  And as you know, Iran is getting the oil because Iran is going to take over all of Iraq.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.062]  The more I research what you've actually said and done, it's amazing.
[01:13:13.062 --> 01:13:19.406]  You were the only leading American figure who openly said, do not go to war in Iraq.
[01:13:19.406 --> 01:13:23.469]  They had almost, what, 90% votes in Congress for it, bipartisan.
[01:13:23.469 --> 01:13:26.211]  You said, don't do it, Iran will take over.
[01:13:26.211 --> 01:13:37.038]  I mean, look, you can say that today, and everybody can say that, but you said that in 2001, 2002, 2003, when it was very unpopular, because you've done your research and had good advisors.
[01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:39.500]  How did you know that when almost no one else did?
[01:13:40.438 --> 01:13:43.261]  Well, first of all, I'm the most militaristic person there is.
[01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:44.101]  I'm going to build the military.
[01:13:44.101 --> 01:13:48.325]  If I win, I'm going to make our military so strong, so powerful that nobody's going to mess with us.
[01:13:48.325 --> 01:13:51.088]  We're going to take care of our vets and all of that.
[01:13:51.088 --> 01:13:55.512]  But I have to tell you, you have to know if you're going to go to war, you have to do it properly and you have to know what to do.
[01:13:55.512 --> 01:13:56.333]  I viewed it as this.
[01:13:56.833 --> 01:14:01.675]  Iran and Iraq were the same in terms of strength, and they'd have been constantly fighting.
[01:14:01.675 --> 01:14:03.135]  That's all they do is they fight, right?
[01:14:03.135 --> 01:14:10.337]  They go to war all the time, and they'd move 10 feet left, 10 feet right, 10 feet left, then they'd rest, and then they'd start it again four years later.
[01:14:10.337 --> 01:14:12.318]  This has been gone on for decades.
[01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:13.755]  Forever.
[01:14:13.755 --> 01:14:15.016]  And this is the way it is.
[01:14:15.016 --> 01:14:20.438]  I said, if you take out Iran, or if you take out Iraq, either one, you're going to destabilize the Middle East.
[01:14:20.438 --> 01:14:22.118]  Well, we took out Iraq.
[01:14:22.118 --> 01:14:26.500]  And, by the way, Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:27.540]  People don't even know that.
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.541]  So we gave, like, incredible.
[01:14:29.541 --> 01:14:30.261]  We took out Iraq.
[01:14:30.261 --> 01:14:31.362]  I said, you're going to destabilize.
[01:14:31.362 --> 01:14:40.365]  Well, and I said, and you'll know this, and you know this, and I appreciate what you just said, then Iran is going to come in, and Iran is going to take over Iraq.
[01:14:41.025 --> 01:14:42.707]  And they're just taking it over right now.
[01:14:42.707 --> 01:14:44.188]  As we speak, they're taking it over.
[01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:48.972]  Iran is running a rack and very soon will be virtually, gonna be totally running a rack.
[01:14:48.972 --> 01:14:52.215]  Especially after all of the, you know, the deal we just made, which is the worst.
[01:14:52.215 --> 01:14:53.897]  So, I said keep the oil.
[01:14:54.844 --> 01:15:02.087]  And I said, if you're going to leave, you shouldn't have gone in, but they should have left soldiers behind, like 20,000 or a certain number of soldiers.
[01:15:02.087 --> 01:15:03.667]  But if you're going to leave, take the oil.
[01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:05.008]  And I've said it.
[01:15:05.008 --> 01:15:06.608]  Then they left, they didn't take the oil.
[01:15:06.608 --> 01:15:10.950]  So ISIS got the oil, Iran is getting the oil, everybody's getting everything but us.
[01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:12.651]  So we lost thousands of soldiers.
[01:15:12.651 --> 01:15:14.972]  We spent $2 trillion in Iraq.
[01:15:14.972 --> 01:15:17.293]  We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place.
[01:15:17.293 --> 01:15:18.693]  And what do we get out of it?
[01:15:18.693 --> 01:15:19.533]  We get nothing.
[01:15:19.533 --> 01:15:20.254]  We have nothing.
[01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:23.315]  No, the French and the Germans are getting the oil and the Iranians are getting the oil.
[01:15:23.795 --> 01:15:26.057]  And you know who the number one customer for the oil is?
[01:15:26.057 --> 01:15:26.657]  Guess what?
[01:15:26.657 --> 01:15:27.038]  China.
[01:15:27.038 --> 01:15:27.898]  That's right.
[01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:29.300]  How smart is China?
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.041]  They outsmart us on every level.
[01:15:31.041 --> 01:15:33.523]  Militarily, they outsmart us on trade.
[01:15:33.523 --> 01:15:34.604]  Like, we're losing.
[01:15:34.604 --> 01:15:38.007]  We have a $450 billion trade deficit with China.
[01:15:38.007 --> 01:15:38.547]  Let me ask you this.
[01:15:38.547 --> 01:15:42.010]  You're a top business guy, you know, on your own, from nothing.
[01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:43.871]  How did China get 97% of rare earth
[01:15:46.213 --> 01:15:47.475]  Uh, minerals in the world.
[01:15:47.475 --> 01:15:54.202]  How is the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals when it's what goes in the smartphones, the computers, trillions is made a year.
[01:15:54.202 --> 01:15:56.665]  How did we just give them the global market in that?
[01:15:56.665 --> 01:15:57.946]  That's crazy.
[01:15:57.946 --> 01:16:00.048]  Well, what a lot of people don't know Afghanistan.
[01:16:00.048 --> 01:16:05.955]  Now, Afghanistan is a place we can go in because you know, you have Pakistan and you have nuclear weapons and a lot of things going on there, but
[01:16:06.636 --> 01:16:11.100]  We go into Afghanistan, we're fighting, you know, tremendous mountains and ridges.
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:15.425]  We're fighting on one side, and you know who's got their excavators on the other side?
[01:16:15.425 --> 01:16:15.565]  China.
[01:16:15.565 --> 01:16:17.006]  China's picking out all the minerals.
[01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:21.030]  You know, Afghanistan, nobody knew this, Afghanistan is rich with minerals.
[01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:22.212]  Not oil, but minerals.
[01:16:22.212 --> 01:16:23.033]  Lithium, everything.
[01:16:23.925 --> 01:16:26.006]  And China's taken out all the minerals.
[01:16:26.006 --> 01:16:26.927]  And here we are fighting.
[01:16:26.927 --> 01:16:27.747]  We have trillions.
[01:16:27.747 --> 01:16:30.469]  We have like a trillion dollars in Afghanistan.
[01:16:30.469 --> 01:16:31.590]  And we get nothing out of it.
[01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:35.732]  And we're going to end up leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and that.
[01:16:35.732 --> 01:16:36.633]  We get nothing.
[01:16:36.633 --> 01:16:38.794]  China has taken out the minerals.
[01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:46.579]  They're the buyers, the big buyers at very, very low prices of, as you know, of the oil in Iraq and probably in Syria.
[01:16:46.579 --> 01:16:48.540]  But China is a big buyer of the oil.
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.922]  But one thing with the oil, because you've covered it.
[01:16:51.502 --> 01:16:54.810]  For three years I've been saying hit the oil because ISIS is getting stronger.
[01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:59.060]  They're no JV, as the president said, and they're certainly not contained.
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.265]  But I said hit the oil and hit them hard.
[01:17:02.062 --> 01:17:03.082]  And they laughed at me.
[01:17:03.082 --> 01:17:06.824]  And they would put generals on television saying, no, that strategy wouldn't work.
[01:17:06.824 --> 01:17:09.245]  Well, after Paris, they started hitting the oil.
[01:17:09.245 --> 01:17:09.925]  And it does work.
[01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:12.466]  The problem is we've given them a two-year edge.
[01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:13.727]  They have billions of dollars.
[01:17:13.727 --> 01:17:17.668]  The Russians started hitting the oil for one month and ISIS is already rolling over.
[01:17:17.668 --> 01:17:24.651]  Can you speak to, as president, what your relationship would be with foreign leaders and what you know about Vladimir Putin?
[01:17:24.651 --> 01:17:28.573]  Because all I know is, why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us?
[01:17:29.193 --> 01:17:29.614]  Right.
[01:17:29.614 --> 01:17:33.838]  Well, number one, and just to finish on the oil, by the way, I say hit the oil, but we should keep the oil.
[01:17:33.838 --> 01:17:40.626]  In other words, we should keep, we'll get Exxon Mobil, they'll go in, we'll get other of our oil companies, we'll get some of the great oil companies, we bid it out.
[01:17:40.626 --> 01:17:41.587]  We should keep the oil.
[01:17:41.587 --> 01:17:44.050]  You know, in the old days, to the victor belong the spoils, right?
[01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:44.711]  We don't have that.
[01:17:44.711 --> 01:17:46.413]  We go in, we fight a war, and we leave.
[01:17:46.413 --> 01:17:47.254]  We get nothing.
[01:17:47.254 --> 01:17:48.155]  Except we get death.
[01:17:48.695 --> 01:17:49.716]  And we get deficit.
[01:17:49.716 --> 01:17:51.137]  That's all we get.
[01:17:51.137 --> 01:17:52.798]  I think I get along great with people.
[01:17:52.798 --> 01:17:54.719]  I mean, I will probably get along well with him.
[01:17:54.719 --> 01:17:56.160]  And if I don't, somebody else will.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:56.901]  And who knows?
[01:17:56.901 --> 01:17:58.662]  You know, he's a difficult cookie.
[01:17:58.662 --> 01:17:59.903]  He's tough and he's smart.
[01:17:59.903 --> 01:18:03.566]  I was on the show 60 Minutes with him recently.
[01:18:03.566 --> 01:18:04.266]  Not together.
[01:18:04.266 --> 01:18:07.208]  I mean, they did him and they profiled me at the same show, which was there.
[01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:08.709]  We were stable mates, right?
[01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:10.811]  But I think I get along very well with him.
[01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.332]  I think it's fine.
[01:18:12.332 --> 01:18:13.653]  But here's the thing.
[01:18:13.653 --> 01:18:16.555]  We lose with every country and yet we don't get along with any countries.
[01:18:16.555 --> 01:18:17.616]  China is killing us.
[01:18:17.836 --> 01:18:19.016]  Everybody's killing us.
[01:18:19.016 --> 01:18:21.137]  China's just beating us to a pulp and trade.
[01:18:21.137 --> 01:18:23.598]  Japan, Mexico is killing us.
[01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:25.398]  And yet we don't get along with anybody.
[01:18:25.398 --> 01:18:27.039]  With me, they're not going to get so rich.
[01:18:27.039 --> 01:18:27.639]  Believe me.
[01:18:27.639 --> 01:18:29.419]  What about crippled America?
[01:18:29.419 --> 01:18:30.279]  It's a number one.
[01:18:30.279 --> 01:18:31.440]  You got a big rally tonight.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.540]  Everywhere you go, your crowds just get bigger.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.961]  I mean, obviously, you're probably going to get the Republican nomination now.
[01:18:36.961 --> 01:18:37.301]  Wow.
[01:18:37.301 --> 01:18:39.802]  And you're ready for the dirty tricks.
[01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:40.842]  One minute left, Donald Trump.
[01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:43.163]  What do you have to say about your book and what's coming up?
[01:18:43.743 --> 01:18:45.824]  Well, first of all, before the book, you mentioned one thing.
[01:18:45.824 --> 01:18:48.244]  I had never heard that, but I am in this to win it.
[01:18:48.244 --> 01:18:51.025]  I am not in this to say, oh, gee, I've done a really good job.
[01:18:51.025 --> 01:18:53.946]  A reporter called up, a very powerful reporter, said, how does it feel?
[01:18:53.946 --> 01:18:54.446]  How does it feel?
[01:18:54.446 --> 01:18:58.267]  I said, it only feels, because they said what we've done has never been done before politically.
[01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:00.067]  And I've been in the polls for five months.
[01:19:00.067 --> 01:19:01.448]  Since it came out, I'm number one.
[01:19:02.068 --> 01:19:03.790]  I said, it's only good if we win.
[01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:06.513]  If I don't win, I've wasted a lot of time.
[01:19:06.513 --> 01:19:07.274]  That's the way I view it.
[01:19:07.274 --> 01:19:08.395]  He said, no, no, you haven't.
[01:19:08.395 --> 01:19:08.776]  You haven't.
[01:19:08.776 --> 01:19:10.878]  I said, believe me, if I don't win.
[01:19:10.878 --> 01:19:13.701]  Because we can't do anything to make our country great if I don't win.
[01:19:13.701 --> 01:19:15.704]  I'll be watching television someplace.
[01:19:15.704 --> 01:19:16.384]  It'll be, forget it.
[01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:19.686]  So I wrote a book called Crippled America.
[01:19:19.686 --> 01:19:21.867]  It's doing fantastic business.
[01:19:21.867 --> 01:19:23.528]  I don't know if you can see that thing right up there.
[01:19:23.528 --> 01:19:24.368]  We can.
[01:19:24.368 --> 01:19:25.769]  But it's doing great business.
[01:19:25.769 --> 01:19:29.170]  I hope your audience goes out and buys it as Christmas gifts and everything else.
[01:19:29.170 --> 01:19:32.672]  And I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing.
[01:19:32.672 --> 01:19:34.012]  I will not let you down.
[01:19:34.012 --> 01:19:37.634]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:19:37.634 --> 01:19:42.436]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be you'll be looking at me in a year and a year or two years.
[01:19:42.436 --> 01:19:43.336]  Let's give me a little bit of
[01:19:43.396 --> 01:19:43.957]  I don't know.
[01:20:00.089 --> 01:20:09.394]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid.
[01:20:09.394 --> 01:20:12.275]  The potential for power grid chaos.
[01:20:12.275 --> 01:20:20.419]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[01:20:20.419 --> 01:20:23.341]  My friends, chaos is already here, and it's gonna get a lot worse.
[01:20:23.601 --> 01:20:29.625]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:33.528]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system at my house.
[01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:35.410]  The Solutions from Science system.

[01:21:35.995 --> 01:21:38.817]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:21:38.817 --> 01:21:39.237]  Awesome!

[01:22:28.832 --> 01:22:31.572]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.

[01:23:56.169 --> 01:23:56.369]  Yum!
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.303]  Because I want to move to Spain.
[01:24:06.303 --> 01:24:08.148]  I really, really want to move to Spain right now.
[01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:16.099]  Rob Dewitt with Infowars.com, and I would like to be the first to thank white America for ruining the country.
[01:24:16.099 --> 01:24:17.059]  Although I'm not the first.
[01:24:17.059 --> 01:24:22.662]  In fact, Van Jones went out on election night and got on CNN and said, it's white lash.
[01:24:22.662 --> 01:24:29.124]  And that's the reason it happened, because white people are so bad and evil and mad that they wanted to send a message that a woman couldn't be president.
[01:24:29.124 --> 01:24:29.805]  We've talked about race.
[01:24:29.805 --> 01:24:32.066]  I mean, we've talked about everything but race tonight.
[01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:32.906]  We've talked about income.
[01:24:32.906 --> 01:24:33.606]  We've talked about class.
[01:24:33.606 --> 01:24:34.467]  We've talked about region.
[01:24:34.467 --> 01:24:35.767]  We haven't talked about race.
[01:24:35.767 --> 01:24:36.988]  This was a white lash.
[01:24:37.788 --> 01:24:41.797]  This was a white lash against a changing country.
[01:24:41.797 --> 01:24:45.605]  It was a white lash against a black president in part.
[01:24:45.605 --> 01:24:48.711]  And then last night we had Samantha Bee saying white people ruined America.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.480]  That's right, here's the clip.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.781]  People will be looking for someone to blame.
[01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:57.162]  The pollsters, the strident feminists, the Democratic Party, a vengeful God.
[01:24:57.162 --> 01:25:02.803]  But once you dust for fingerprints, it's pretty clear who ruined America.
[01:25:02.803 --> 01:25:03.824]  White people.
[01:25:03.824 --> 01:25:06.744]  She then joked and said, oh, I guess ruining Brooklyn was a dry run.
[01:25:06.744 --> 01:25:15.486]  That's right, because somebody who builds up properties and hires people to build them and maintain them is ruining America and ruining jobs.
[01:25:15.486 --> 01:25:16.767]  Just like he did in D.C.
[01:25:16.767 --> 01:25:17.727]  with the new post office.
[01:25:18.067 --> 01:25:22.193]  In fact, the government gave him the bid, and he brought it in under budget and under time.
[01:25:22.193 --> 01:25:23.054]  That's terrible.
[01:25:23.054 --> 01:25:24.456]  That's the wrong thing to do, Donald.
[01:25:24.456 --> 01:25:26.919]  You're doing a horrible disservice to our country.
[01:25:26.919 --> 01:25:28.622]  But wait, we got more comedians.
[01:25:28.622 --> 01:25:33.929]  Here's Chelsea Handler, literally breaking down in tears that Hillary Clinton didn't win.
[01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:42.256]  And I think, I guess the message that I want to like spread out to other women is, is exactly what you're saying is not to give up.
[01:25:42.256 --> 01:25:49.002]  Sorry, I hate crying on camera, but is not to give up because this is so important.
[01:25:49.002 --> 01:25:55.086]  And it's easy to say, throw in the towel and that we're going to leave or I'm going to move to Spain because I want to move to Spain.
[01:25:55.086 --> 01:25:56.948]  I really, really want to move to Spain right now.
[01:25:56.948 --> 01:26:00.311]  And I'm going to get serious here in a second, but let me show you one more clip.
[01:26:01.078 --> 01:26:07.224]  Here's Seth Meyers wiping away the tears that his mother might not get to see the first woman president.
[01:26:07.224 --> 01:26:10.727]  Whoever you are, I hope I live to see your inauguration.
[01:26:10.727 --> 01:26:12.689]  And I hope my mom does too.
[01:26:12.689 --> 01:26:14.030]  She was really excited yesterday.
[01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:17.653]  And I was really sad for her.
[01:26:18.786 --> 01:26:25.328]  And then he went on to say, well, the first woman president could still be out there watching this and then you still get to be the first woman president.
[01:26:25.328 --> 01:26:30.110]  Look, people, it's not even the point that Hillary Clinton would have been or not have been the first woman president.
[01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:31.530]  She's an evil bitch.
[01:26:31.530 --> 01:26:32.850]  That's the bottom line.
[01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:37.752]  In fact, one of her first jobs as a public defender was defending a child rapist.
[01:26:37.752 --> 01:26:44.094]  And she used tactics on this little girl who we had just behind me in the studio, Kathy Shelton, who was 12 years old when she was pulled off her bike and gang raped.
[01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:46.734]  How's that for feminism?
[01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:50.977]  Okay, and Hillary went on to take evidence and move it across state lines.
[01:26:50.977 --> 01:26:53.178]  She mishandled evidence in this case.
[01:26:53.178 --> 01:26:57.201]  She actually took this little girl, brought her up on the stand and made her cry.
[01:26:57.201 --> 01:27:02.585]  And she was using tactics now that are illegal under rape shield laws.
[01:27:02.585 --> 01:27:04.906]  Does that sound like a person that needs to be president?
[01:27:16.134 --> 01:27:22.321]  He was saying he knew I liked it, except in a more terribly manner than that.
[01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:30.090]  I was left out on the ground, barely conscious.
[01:27:30.090 --> 01:27:32.633]  Sometimes, at one time, I was unconscious.
[01:27:34.974 --> 01:27:42.316]  It's pretty funny though, watching people like Colbert on the Colbert Report having his election night special when they knew Hillary was going to win.
[01:27:42.316 --> 01:27:50.239]  They knew without a shadow of a doubt because she had sewn it up in the polls and that they had, it was just nothing but a little bit of racist white people that were going to vote for Trump.
[01:27:50.239 --> 01:27:54.500]  And then watching them just almost cry on TV as they saw the results coming in.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:28:02.563]  It's even funnier watching the Young Turks as a whole panel watching the utter disdain on their faces because they lost.
[01:28:03.283 --> 01:28:04.004]  Get over it.
[01:28:04.004 --> 01:28:04.904]  Let's move on.
[01:28:04.904 --> 01:28:12.511]  Now, let's not keep encouraging people by going, it's only racists doing it because I'm not a racist and I voted for Donald Trump.
[01:28:12.511 --> 01:28:13.351]  Period.
[01:28:13.351 --> 01:28:16.214]  And there's plenty of other people that voted for him that aren't racist either.
[01:28:16.214 --> 01:28:21.698]  And we don't have a desire to hate women and ruin this country with misogyny or xenophobia.
[01:28:21.698 --> 01:28:23.420]  All we want to do is protect the border.
[01:28:24.730 --> 01:28:30.075]  Have fair elections and have a decent economy where everybody has a chance to succeed.
[01:28:30.075 --> 01:28:36.161]  And if you don't want that for people, if you think you have to run around and take care of everybody, then you're the real racist out there.
[01:28:36.161 --> 01:28:38.863]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:28:49.456 --> 01:28:58.899]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:28:58.899 --> 01:29:01.519]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:29:01.519 --> 01:29:04.981]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:29:04.981 --> 01:29:11.122]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:29:11.122 --> 01:29:15.804]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:29:16.104 --> 01:29:22.286]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:29:22.286 --> 01:29:29.809]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:29:29.809 --> 01:29:37.132]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:52.537]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.537 --> 01:29:56.152]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:04.902]  The NFL is considering some serious changes as ratings continue to plummet.
[01:30:04.902 --> 01:30:11.624]  Some of the changes include reducing ads and ad time, reducing the time of game, to perhaps even changing the way it's officiated.
[01:30:11.624 --> 01:30:26.350]  These were among the things mentioned by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to increase ratings, but he failed to mention the protest of our country by some of its players, like Colin Papernack, Erika Reid, Kenny Shills, Jackie Tartt, Elizabeth Harreld, and Luz Irving.
[01:30:26.590 --> 01:30:31.513]  Who have been protesting the country during the National Anthem, which without a doubt is affecting ratings.
[01:30:31.513 --> 01:30:37.236]  Wait, the players of the league are protesting the people in the country who drive the high ratings, and the ratings are dropping?
[01:30:37.236 --> 01:30:37.916]  Shocking.
[01:30:37.916 --> 01:30:40.418]  But the PCNFL can't address this.
[01:30:40.418 --> 01:30:45.821]  Perhaps the silver lining in all of this is that people are less inclined to being obsessed with football all day long,
[01:30:46.081 --> 01:30:55.391]  And have been following the presidential election as well as other local and national issues that they see they can affect with vigilance and action, not just taking a knee.
[01:30:55.391 --> 01:30:57.513]  This is Owen Troyer from InfoWars.com.
[01:31:00.117 --> 01:31:00.937]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:00.937 --> 01:31:03.218]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:31:03.218 --> 01:31:07.060]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:09.141]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:31:09.141 --> 01:31:19.425]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:31:19.425 --> 01:31:25.388]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:31:25.868 --> 01:31:46.617]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.

[01:32:08.803 --> 01:32:11.004]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[01:32:11.004 --> 01:32:15.666]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:32:15.666 --> 01:32:19.627]  Individual rights must take a back seat to the collective.
[01:32:19.627 --> 01:32:21.468]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:32:21.468 --> 01:32:23.209]  It's gonna be coming at you good.
[01:32:23.209 --> 01:32:23.989]  Oh, yeah.
[01:32:23.989 --> 01:32:25.630]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:27.071]  At all.
[01:32:27.071 --> 01:32:28.132]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:32:28.132 --> 01:32:30.334]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:32:30.334 --> 01:32:31.496]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:32:31.496 --> 01:32:33.478]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[01:32:33.478 --> 01:32:39.484]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:32:39.484 --> 01:32:41.426]  Then beef was for supper.
[01:32:42.126 --> 01:32:44.748]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:32:44.748 --> 01:32:46.569]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:32:46.569 --> 01:32:48.110]  DVDs now available.
[01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:52.493]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.

[01:32:56.196 --> 01:32:58.538]  Revelation, the movie.info.
[01:32:58.538 --> 01:33:00.899]  Let's fix it.
[01:33:00.899 --> 01:33:05.983]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:17.972]  We're awaiting Donald Trump.
[01:33:17.972 --> 01:33:20.694]  Roger Stone, this is a surreal moment for you.
[01:33:20.694 --> 01:33:21.795]  Tell us your heart and soul.
[01:33:21.795 --> 01:33:27.499]  You know, Alex, I wanted Donald Trump to run for president as early as 1988.
[01:33:27.499 --> 01:33:36.266]  I arranged for him to speak to the Chamber of Commerce in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
[01:33:36.266 --> 01:33:43.852]  And a Portsmouth City Councilman named Mike Dunbar formed the first known draft Trump for President committee.
[01:33:44.671 --> 01:33:47.894]  He was still working for Trump in the most recent New Hampshire primary.
[01:33:47.894 --> 01:33:49.955]  No, you gave me a six months ago like a big present.
[01:33:49.955 --> 01:33:51.577]  Oh, here's a Donald Trump 2000 thing.
[01:33:51.577 --> 01:33:52.577]  Nobody's got this.
[01:33:52.577 --> 01:34:03.666]  Yeah, so in 2000, I wanted him to seek the Reform Party nomination because I could see that George Bush and Al Gore were not what America needed.
[01:34:03.666 --> 01:34:07.990]  And he did seriously consider that, briefly.
[01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:09.811]  Ross Perot urged him to run.
[01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:12.914]  My friend Jesse Ventura, then governor of Minnesota, urged him to run.
[01:34:14.453 --> 01:34:16.375]  And he did look at it.
[01:34:16.375 --> 01:34:19.778]  And of course, the Reform Party then was entitled to federal matching funds.
[01:34:19.778 --> 01:34:24.682]  So he would have been running on OPM, other people's money.
[01:34:24.682 --> 01:34:29.906]  In the end, he made what I think was a shrewd calculation that you couldn't win as a third party candidate.
[01:34:29.906 --> 01:34:32.808]  You could only win as a Republican or a Democrat.
[01:34:32.808 --> 01:34:34.470]  Three years ago, I wanted him to run.
[01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:37.973]  I signed up again as a consultant to his exploratory effort.
[01:34:39.442 --> 01:34:42.443]  And the time was really not quite right.
[01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:44.984]  I was probably more for it than he was.
[01:34:44.984 --> 01:34:48.685]  So this has been a long time coming for me.
[01:34:48.685 --> 01:34:57.908]  I have taken the beating from my friends and some people who aren't my friends for 30 years of saying, Donald Trump, come on, you're out of your mind.
[01:34:57.908 --> 01:34:59.169]  He's never gonna run.
[01:34:59.169 --> 01:35:01.650]  This is all about furnishing the brand.
[01:35:01.650 --> 01:35:06.911]  This is all about the fact that he's a media whore and he just likes to read his name.
[01:35:06.911 --> 01:35:08.112]  He's never really gonna do it.
[01:35:08.972 --> 01:35:11.713]  So, this is vindication.
[01:35:11.713 --> 01:35:14.174]  They've been proven wrong in spades.
[01:35:14.174 --> 01:35:14.975]  Boy, have they.
[01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:17.256]  A royal flush for Roger Stone.
[01:35:17.256 --> 01:35:18.877]  It is a great night.
[01:35:18.877 --> 01:35:21.678]  I can't wait to hear what he has to say here.
[01:35:21.678 --> 01:35:26.140]  I would like him to claim this so that the moment will be complete.
[01:35:27.811 --> 01:35:32.173]  And it's 1.44, about to be 1.45 central time.
[01:35:32.173 --> 01:35:33.834]  I'm here with Roger Stone.
[01:35:33.834 --> 01:35:35.955]  History is happening now.
[01:35:35.955 --> 01:35:37.556]  There's Donald Trump, let's fade up the audio.
[01:35:37.556 --> 01:35:39.177]  There's Pence, the vice president.
[01:35:39.177 --> 01:35:39.917]  There's the family.
[01:35:39.917 --> 01:35:41.998]  That is now the president, vice president-elect.
[01:35:43.914 --> 01:35:46.835]  Pence is preparing to come down.
[01:35:46.835 --> 01:35:55.499]  This is just a repudiation of the establishment, a repudiation of all their evil, all their lies, all their stuck-up-ness.
[01:35:55.499 --> 01:35:58.941]  All these, I don't want to say ugly, but these ugly-looking
[01:35:59.581 --> 01:36:04.086]  Dumbasses that hijack the country, just pissing on us.
[01:36:04.086 --> 01:36:07.630]  You see the bikers for Trump with their sign, a great bunch of guys.
[01:36:07.630 --> 01:36:08.971]  They're going to try to hit us though.
[01:36:08.971 --> 01:36:10.353]  So, we're about to hear this.
[01:36:10.353 --> 01:36:12.916]  This is Pence, Vice President, Governor of Indiana.
[01:36:12.916 --> 01:36:13.636]  We're hearing this now.
[01:36:13.636 --> 01:36:15.478]  Roger, let's hear from Pence.
[01:36:15.478 --> 01:36:16.179]  Get ready.
[01:36:16.179 --> 01:36:16.780]  This is it.
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:18.642]  This is the rebirth of the republic.
[01:36:18.642 --> 01:36:19.583]  This is happening now.
[01:36:20.283 --> 01:36:21.244]  This is a historic night!
[01:36:21.244 --> 01:36:21.964]  Thank you.
[01:36:44.335 --> 01:36:45.075]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:45.075 --> 01:36:47.917]  This is almost as good as Yorktown to be in a dentist.
[01:36:47.917 --> 01:36:48.777]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:36:48.777 --> 01:36:50.338]  It's already a complicated business.
[01:36:50.338 --> 01:36:52.719]  Can you believe this is happening?
[01:36:52.719 --> 01:36:53.960]  Why do I have a bad feeling earlier today?
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:54.720]  This is so good.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.641]  Okay, let's turn on Trump.
[01:36:55.641 --> 01:36:56.661]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:56.661 --> 01:36:57.882]  Let's hear it.
[01:36:57.882 --> 01:37:01.284]  The President-elect, 45.
[01:37:01.284 --> 01:37:04.205]  Yeah!
[01:37:04.205 --> 01:37:08.387]  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
[01:37:13.386 --> 01:37:20.050]  She congratulated us, it's about us, on our victory.
[01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:26.353]  And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard campaign.
[01:37:26.353 --> 01:37:29.795]  I mean, she fought very hard.
[01:37:29.795 --> 01:37:34.618]  Hillary has worked
[01:37:35.845 --> 01:37:39.286]  Very long and very hard over a long period of time.
[01:37:39.286 --> 01:37:40.346]  She worked hard to bring us down.
[01:37:40.346 --> 01:37:44.068]  And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service.
[01:37:44.068 --> 01:37:44.908]  Let's arrest her immediately.
[01:37:44.908 --> 01:37:46.548]  To our country.
[01:37:46.548 --> 01:37:47.609]  I don't like this.
[01:37:47.609 --> 01:37:48.129]  Very sincere.
[01:37:48.129 --> 01:37:49.429]  I know he's got to be gracious.
[01:37:49.429 --> 01:37:50.169]  Now it's time.
[01:37:50.169 --> 01:37:51.830]  What do you say to this?
[01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:53.851]  For America to bind the wounds of division.
[01:37:53.851 --> 01:37:54.851]  Time to break.
[01:37:54.851 --> 01:37:55.731]  Have to get together.
[01:37:55.731 --> 01:37:57.092]  He's got to be big, right?
[01:37:57.092 --> 01:38:04.254]  To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us
[01:38:05.233 --> 01:38:11.438]  Is that Barron up there?
[01:38:11.438 --> 01:38:18.403]  Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream.
[01:38:18.403 --> 01:38:20.585]  Do you imagine how they're crapping their pants right now?
[01:38:20.585 --> 01:38:22.006]  They're so upset right now.
[01:38:22.006 --> 01:38:24.227]  That is now what I want to do for our country.
[01:38:37.071 --> 01:38:39.253]  Tremendous potential.
[01:38:39.253 --> 01:38:41.335]  I've gotten to know our country so well.
[01:38:41.335 --> 01:38:42.597]  Tremendous potential.
[01:38:42.597 --> 01:38:45.259]  It's going to be a beautiful thing.
[01:38:45.259 --> 01:38:52.547]  Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential.
[01:38:52.547 --> 01:38:57.592]  The forgotten men and women will be forgotten no longer.
[01:38:59.522 --> 01:39:00.723]  We're going to take care of our veterans.
[01:39:00.723 --> 01:39:03.125]  We're going to cut taxes for everybody.
[01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:06.588]  We are going to fix our inner cities.
[01:39:06.588 --> 01:39:12.173]  And we're going to rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals.
[01:39:12.173 --> 01:39:17.899]  We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become
[01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:21.976]  By the way, second to none.
[01:39:21.976 --> 01:39:26.820]  And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:27.221]  I love it.
[01:39:27.221 --> 01:39:29.022]  Who else would put a James Kidd up on stage?
[01:39:29.022 --> 01:39:29.883]  This is just so great.
[01:39:29.883 --> 01:39:34.468]  We will also finally take care of our great veterans.
[01:39:38.490 --> 01:39:41.333]  He's been so loyal and I've gotten to know so many.
[01:39:41.333 --> 01:39:45.278]  I've talked to folks that know the Trumps, they're just totally in the military.
[01:39:45.278 --> 01:39:50.866]  The time I spent with them during the campaign has been among my greatest honors.
[01:39:50.866 --> 01:39:52.348]  Our veterans are incredible people.
[01:39:53.048 --> 01:39:57.709]  We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal.
[01:39:57.709 --> 01:40:06.912]  I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all.
[01:40:06.912 --> 01:40:09.413]  It's gonna happen.
[01:40:09.413 --> 01:40:11.773]  We got the crew in here delusionally happy.
[01:40:11.773 --> 01:40:12.974]  Let's hear it from them.
[01:40:12.974 --> 01:40:13.674]  What's going on here?
[01:40:16.746 --> 01:40:22.890]  The thing is, good people never realize we have the power to overcome.
[01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:24.331]  We have to rediscover that.
[01:40:24.331 --> 01:40:28.574]  We'll have great relationships.
[01:40:28.574 --> 01:40:31.997]  We expect to have great, great relationships.
[01:40:31.997 --> 01:40:33.198]  No dream is too big.
[01:40:33.198 --> 01:40:35.159]  No challenge is too great.
[01:40:35.159 --> 01:40:38.982]  Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.
[01:40:38.982 --> 01:40:43.345]  We will no longer settle for anything less than the best.
[01:40:45.066 --> 01:40:47.147]  Listen, they're gonna counter-strike.
[01:40:47.147 --> 01:40:49.789]  I'm not over-confident, I'm not under-confident.
[01:40:49.789 --> 01:40:52.050]  Roger, they're going to pull some stuff.
[01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:54.031]  Obama's in for two months.
[01:40:54.031 --> 01:40:58.274]  We've got November, December, January until the 18th.
[01:40:58.274 --> 01:40:59.755]  What do we do?
[01:40:59.755 --> 01:41:00.736]  The pardons.
[01:41:00.736 --> 01:41:04.098]  I've been predicting this year for well over a year.
[01:41:04.098 --> 01:41:06.879]  That's where they will move.
[01:41:06.879 --> 01:41:09.421]  So we should bully Pulpit and try to block that.
[01:41:09.861 --> 01:41:10.081]  I would.
[01:41:10.081 --> 01:41:11.362]  We will deal fairly.
[01:41:11.362 --> 01:41:14.545]  If they wanted to leave and quit, I'd do that.
[01:41:14.545 --> 01:41:15.706]  They're not going to back off.
[01:41:15.706 --> 01:41:18.309]  They're all just arrogant assholes.
[01:41:18.309 --> 01:41:21.552]  Yes, but they've gotten a real taste in defeat tonight.
[01:41:21.906 --> 01:41:23.807]  Partnership, not conflict.
[01:41:23.807 --> 01:41:30.071]  Hey look, how big, you've been in a career, nine administrations, in four of them, is this the biggest thing ever?
[01:41:30.071 --> 01:41:35.715]  Without any question, look, I thought Reagan's election was the greatest political eye you could have.
[01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:37.696]  This is ten times better.
[01:41:37.696 --> 01:41:41.118]  I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now.
[01:41:41.118 --> 01:41:42.739]  Oh, the public only knew how good it was.
[01:41:42.739 --> 01:41:43.900]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:44.981]  Jesus.
[01:41:44.981 --> 01:41:46.682]  God, no wonder they're freaking out.
[01:41:46.682 --> 01:41:48.243]  They've got our phones tapped, everything.
[01:41:48.723 --> 01:41:51.905]  They're hearing the conversations behind the scenes.
[01:41:51.905 --> 01:41:55.127]  Watching Donald Trump read our articles every day.
[01:41:55.127 --> 01:41:57.189]  They're shitting their pants.
[01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:59.090]  We just want to cut ties and make everybody rich.
[01:41:59.090 --> 01:42:01.792]  Everybody get along with each other.
[01:42:01.792 --> 01:42:03.393]  They are so pissed right now.
[01:42:03.393 --> 01:42:09.117]  All these asshole bankers.
[01:42:09.117 --> 01:42:10.237]  Where's Robert?
[01:42:10.237 --> 01:42:12.439]  Where is Robert?
[01:42:12.439 --> 01:42:15.401]  My brother Robert.
[01:42:15.401 --> 01:42:18.403]  And they should all be on this stage, but that's okay.
[01:42:19.773 --> 01:42:20.514]  They look great.
[01:42:20.514 --> 01:42:22.215]  And also, my late brother Fred.
[01:42:22.215 --> 01:42:22.775]  Great guy.
[01:42:22.775 --> 01:42:25.558]  Fantastic guy.
[01:42:25.558 --> 01:42:26.659]  Fantastic family.
[01:42:26.659 --> 01:42:28.380]  I was very lucky.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:32.864]  Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents.
[01:42:32.864 --> 01:42:35.306]  To Melania and Don.
[01:42:35.306 --> 01:42:39.529]  Keep the dignity burning.
[01:42:39.529 --> 01:42:41.311]  Celebrating the victory.
[01:42:41.311 --> 01:42:44.754]  And Ivanka.
[01:42:44.754 --> 01:42:47.936]  And Darren.
[01:42:47.936 --> 01:42:48.537]  And Tiffany.
[01:42:50.618 --> 01:42:55.724]  And Barron.
[01:42:55.724 --> 01:42:58.568]  I love you and I thank you.
[01:42:58.568 --> 01:43:01.491]  And especially for putting up with all of those hours.
[01:43:01.491 --> 01:43:03.874]  This was tough.
[01:43:03.874 --> 01:43:07.178]  This was tough.
[01:43:07.178 --> 01:43:09.922]  This political stuff is nasty and it's tough.
[01:43:10.891 --> 01:43:13.052]  So I want to thank my family very much.
[01:43:13.052 --> 01:43:14.192]  Really fantastic.
[01:43:14.192 --> 01:43:15.293]  Thank you all.
[01:43:15.293 --> 01:43:16.033]  Thank you all.
[01:43:16.033 --> 01:43:18.254]  And Lara, unbelievable job.
[01:43:18.254 --> 01:43:19.014]  Unbelievable.
[01:43:19.014 --> 01:43:19.795]  Vanessa, thank you.
[01:43:19.795 --> 01:43:22.036]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just beat the media.
[01:43:22.036 --> 01:43:23.136]  We beat George Soros.
[01:43:23.136 --> 01:43:24.737]  We beat the Rothschilds.
[01:43:24.737 --> 01:43:25.817]  We beat the Rockefellers.
[01:43:25.817 --> 01:43:28.518]  You've all given me such incredible support.
[01:43:28.518 --> 01:43:31.860]  And I will tell you that we have a large group of people.
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:33.641]  You know, they kept saying we have a small staff.
[01:43:33.641 --> 01:43:34.401]  Not so small.
[01:43:34.401 --> 01:43:36.102]  Look at all the people that we have.
[01:43:36.102 --> 01:43:38.042]  Look at all of these people.
[01:43:38.042 --> 01:43:38.923]  And Kellyanne.
[01:43:39.783 --> 01:43:45.328]  Now we gotta make sure we build this country and hire people and really do good.
[01:43:45.328 --> 01:43:49.070]  We gotta deliver now, Roger.
[01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:52.053]  You can promise people we're gonna give them jobs and build this country.
[01:43:52.053 --> 01:43:53.594]  I'm gonna bust my ass to do it.
[01:43:53.594 --> 01:43:55.615]  You know how it is when you run a company.
[01:43:55.615 --> 01:43:57.437]  You want to believe in your people.
[01:43:57.437 --> 01:43:58.197]  They belong to you.
[01:43:58.197 --> 01:43:59.779]  They're part of you.
[01:43:59.779 --> 01:44:00.299]  They help you.
[01:44:00.299 --> 01:44:03.562]  You help them.
[01:44:03.562 --> 01:44:03.882]  Turn it up.
[01:44:06.502 --> 01:44:09.584]  He traveled with us and he went through meetings.
[01:44:09.584 --> 01:44:12.527]  That Rudy never changes.
[01:44:12.527 --> 01:44:13.488]  Where's Rudy?
[01:44:13.488 --> 01:44:15.129]  Where is he?
[01:44:15.129 --> 01:44:15.970]  Oh, Rudy.
[01:44:15.970 --> 01:44:17.851]  Rudy.
[01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:22.875]  Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable.
[01:44:22.875 --> 01:44:24.296]  He lost all the weight, though.
[01:44:24.296 --> 01:44:25.717]  Finally, perfectly.
[01:44:25.717 --> 01:44:26.278]  Thank you, Chris.
[01:44:27.574 --> 01:44:31.878]  The first man, first senator, first major, major politician.
[01:44:31.878 --> 01:44:37.063]  Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington, because he's as smart as you get.
[01:44:37.063 --> 01:44:38.805]  Senator Jeff Sessions.
[01:44:38.805 --> 01:44:40.867]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:40.867 --> 01:44:42.868]  And General Flynn's there.
[01:44:42.868 --> 01:44:43.909]  Governor Chris Christie.
[01:44:43.909 --> 01:44:46.091]  He's got a jettison, Chris Christie.
[01:44:46.091 --> 01:44:50.756]  And Rudy doesn't want him.
[01:44:50.756 --> 01:44:51.096]  Thank you.
[01:44:52.532 --> 01:44:54.674]  I think we're as happy as we are right now.
[01:44:54.674 --> 01:44:54.794]  Yeah.
[01:44:54.794 --> 01:44:55.975]  There we go, baby.
[01:44:55.975 --> 01:44:57.136]  This will be a day long remembered.
[01:44:57.136 --> 01:44:57.356]  Thank you.
[01:45:17.063 --> 01:45:18.165]  Another great man.
[01:45:18.165 --> 01:45:19.548]  Very tough competitor.
[01:45:19.548 --> 01:45:21.472]  He was not easy.
[01:45:21.472 --> 01:45:26.922]  He was not easy.
[01:45:26.922 --> 01:45:27.423]  Who is that?
[01:45:27.423 --> 01:45:28.645]  Is that the mayor that showed up?
[01:45:30.163 --> 01:45:30.643]  Rudy?
[01:45:30.643 --> 01:45:32.845]  Oh, Rudy got up here.
[01:45:32.845 --> 01:45:34.686]  It's going out, it's fine.
[01:45:34.686 --> 01:45:48.434]  Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats.
[01:45:48.434 --> 01:45:49.874]  Dr. Ben Carson.
[01:45:49.874 --> 01:45:52.036]  Where's Ben?
[01:45:52.036 --> 01:45:52.616]  Where is Ben?
[01:45:57.808 --> 01:46:04.174]  And by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic.
[01:46:04.174 --> 01:46:06.255]  Mike and his family, Sarah.
[01:46:06.255 --> 01:46:07.757]  Thank you very much.
[01:46:07.757 --> 01:46:09.999]  General Mike Flynn.
[01:46:09.999 --> 01:46:11.120]  Yes.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.000]  Where is he?
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.482]  Yeah, Flynn's great.
[01:46:13.482 --> 01:46:14.443]  And no, this is perfect.
[01:46:14.443 --> 01:46:15.744]  The point is, he's not up to get us.
[01:46:16.414 --> 01:46:17.675]  This is a major victory.
[01:46:17.675 --> 01:46:19.336]  This is going to shake the world.
[01:46:19.336 --> 01:46:21.817]  We should talk about how they're going to counter-strike.
[01:46:21.817 --> 01:46:22.517]  They're going to counter-strike.
[01:46:22.517 --> 01:46:23.558]  Tonight, I just want to celebrate.
[01:46:23.558 --> 01:46:23.758]  I agree.
[01:46:38.627 --> 01:46:40.089]  Second with him.
[01:46:40.089 --> 01:46:43.134]  He's an unbelievable star.
[01:46:43.134 --> 01:46:44.676]  He is... That's right!
[01:46:44.676 --> 01:46:46.479]  How did you possibly guess?
[01:46:46.479 --> 01:46:48.562]  So, let me tell you about Reince.
[01:46:48.562 --> 01:46:50.164]  And I've said this.
[01:46:50.164 --> 01:46:50.805]  I said Reince...
[01:46:52.031 --> 01:46:52.932]  And I know it.
[01:46:52.932 --> 01:46:53.372]  I know it.
[01:46:53.372 --> 01:46:55.374]  Look at all those people over there.
[01:46:55.374 --> 01:46:55.915]  I know it.
[01:46:55.915 --> 01:46:58.157]  Reince is a superstar.
[01:46:58.157 --> 01:47:02.942]  But I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win.
[01:47:02.942 --> 01:47:06.205]  Because you can't be called a superstar like Secretariat.
[01:47:06.205 --> 01:47:15.093]  If Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful, bronze bus at the track at Belmont.
[01:47:15.093 --> 01:47:16.054]  But I'll tell you, Reince
[01:47:17.095 --> 01:47:18.837]  Is really a star.
[01:47:18.837 --> 01:47:21.980]  And he is the hardest working guy.
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:24.402]  And in a certain way I did this right.
[01:47:24.402 --> 01:47:25.503]  No, I say this.
[01:47:25.503 --> 01:47:27.585]  We have reached the main shield generator.
[01:47:27.585 --> 01:47:29.967]  You may start re-landing.
[01:47:29.967 --> 01:47:31.728]  Target maximum firepower.
[01:47:31.728 --> 01:47:34.211]  It's about time you did this right.
[01:47:35.345 --> 01:47:37.406]  Ooh, a little jab there for 2012.
[01:47:37.406 --> 01:47:39.427]  What are you talking about?
[01:47:39.427 --> 01:47:41.088]  I told you he'd say this, right?
[01:47:41.088 --> 01:47:42.269]  Oh, he did, yeah.
[01:47:42.269 --> 01:47:47.611]  Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump!
[01:47:47.611 --> 01:47:49.372]  Thank you, it's been an honor.
[01:47:49.372 --> 01:47:50.973]  Yeah, yeah, it's a great honor.
[01:47:50.973 --> 01:47:58.737]  We tried to put in our little blue-eyed baby, Paul Ryan, but it's okay.
[01:47:58.737 --> 01:48:00.858]  Tell him he's getting rid of these people, right, Ryan?
[01:48:00.858 --> 01:48:02.099]  I sure hope so.
[01:48:02.099 --> 01:48:04.580]  It's so important to the success in what we've done.
[01:48:05.552 --> 01:48:10.397]  So I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.
[01:48:10.397 --> 01:48:17.125]  The Secret Service people.
[01:48:17.125 --> 01:48:20.148]  See, I'm not Mohert, because we're like Batman.
[01:48:20.148 --> 01:48:22.651]  We used to blame him for the good stuff, but he's not thinking us.
[01:48:22.651 --> 01:48:25.113]  It's okay, because our listeners are the richest people.
[01:48:26.483 --> 01:48:43.795]  And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down to the sea, but they are fantastic people, so I want to thank the Secret Service.
[01:48:43.795 --> 01:48:49.058]  And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight.
[01:48:49.058 --> 01:48:52.561]  These are spectacular people.
[01:48:53.746 --> 01:48:56.928]  Sometimes underappreciated, unfortunately.
[01:48:56.928 --> 01:48:58.188]  But we appreciate them.
[01:48:58.188 --> 01:48:59.409]  We know what they go through.
[01:48:59.409 --> 01:49:07.073]  So it's been what they call a historic event.
[01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:11.995]  But to be really historic, we have to do a great job.
[01:49:11.995 --> 01:49:13.636]  And I promise- That's right, you gotta deliver now, buddy.
[01:49:13.636 --> 01:49:14.577]  We will not let you down.
[01:49:14.577 --> 01:49:15.737]  We will do a great job.
[01:49:15.737 --> 01:49:18.799]  You told me you were gonna let me down.
[01:49:18.799 --> 01:49:22.621]  I look very much forward to being your president.
[01:49:24.331 --> 01:49:47.779]  And hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years, you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that, you will say that that was something that you were really, were very proud to do and, and I can, thank you very much.
[01:49:47.779 --> 01:49:52.601]  And I can only say, that while the campaign is over,
[01:49:53.889 --> 01:49:57.616]  Our work on this movement is now really just beginning.
[01:49:57.616 --> 01:49:58.137]  That's right.
[01:49:58.137 --> 01:50:00.681]  The battle starts now.
[01:50:00.681 --> 01:50:03.466]  We have to deliver tax cuts, industry, jobs, not wars.
[01:50:05.655 --> 01:50:08.876]  And we're going to- Tell me, Roger, he's not gonna start a war, right?
[01:50:08.876 --> 01:50:10.257]  I don't think they'll start a war.
[01:50:10.257 --> 01:50:12.738]  Please, God.
[01:50:12.738 --> 01:50:14.579]  You'll be so proud.
[01:50:14.579 --> 01:50:16.179]  Again, it's my honor.
[01:50:16.179 --> 01:50:18.240]  It's an amazing evening.
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:21.061]  It's been an amazing two-year period.
[01:50:21.061 --> 01:50:24.483]  And I love this country.
[01:50:24.483 --> 01:50:25.783]  Thank you.
[01:50:25.783 --> 01:50:27.884]  Thank you very much.
[01:50:27.884 --> 01:50:29.105]  And thank you.
[01:51:00.686 --> 01:51:05.468]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:51:05.468 --> 01:51:11.351]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:51:11.351 --> 01:51:17.874]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:51:17.874 --> 01:51:21.915]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[01:51:21.915 --> 01:51:28.158]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[01:51:28.158 --> 01:51:29.919]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[01:51:30.339 --> 01:51:32.220]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:35.462]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[01:51:35.462 --> 01:51:37.062]  Savory and delicious.
[01:51:37.062 --> 01:51:39.884]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:51:39.884 --> 01:51:40.564]  Awesome.
[01:51:40.564 --> 01:51:43.646]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[01:51:43.646 --> 01:51:45.207]  NASA PAC Technology.
[01:51:45.207 --> 01:51:45.827]  Bacon.
[01:51:45.827 --> 01:51:49.989]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[01:51:49.989 --> 01:51:51.410]  Or warm and serve.
[01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:53.471]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:51:53.471 --> 01:51:55.412]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[01:51:55.412 --> 01:51:58.193]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.

[01:52:00.354 --> 01:52:01.975]  Hi, my name is Stephen Holstein.
[01:52:01.975 --> 01:52:06.878]  In my 20s, I abused stimulants and anabolic steroids to the point where my adrenal glands were shot.
[01:52:06.878 --> 01:52:09.960]  I suffered from extreme fatigue and an inability to handle stress.
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:16.664]  For over six years, I have been taking adrenal supplements including herbs, glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5.
[01:52:16.664 --> 01:52:20.587]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal results.
[01:52:20.587 --> 01:52:25.770]  Now, just after one month on Synergy One and ADR Medix, I truly feel rejuvenated.
[01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:32.815]  I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement as I did just 10 minutes after taking ADR Medix.
[01:52:32.815 --> 01:52:37.158]  I then noticed Synergy One made me wake up rested and with much more energy.
[01:52:37.158 --> 01:52:40.200]  No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:48.326]  I had almost considered going to another country for stem cell therapy as a last resort, but now I truly feel rejuvenated on Synergy One and ADR Medix.
[01:52:48.795 --> 01:52:51.056]  Success happens with synergistic nutrition.
[01:52:51.056 --> 01:52:53.978]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:52:53.978 --> 01:52:55.718]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:52:59.858 --> 01:53:04.680]  Will the government protect your family from Iran and North Korea's newest weapon, EMP?
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:06.540]  We buy guns to protect ourselves.
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:08.821]  Home, health, and car insurance for accidents.
[01:53:08.821 --> 01:53:10.522]  Maybe you also have food storage.
[01:53:10.522 --> 01:53:14.563]  But how would you keep your refrigerator running in a long-term EMP blackout?
[01:53:14.563 --> 01:53:22.866]  Using tested military designs, the Solark EMP-hardened solar generator protects and powers your critical appliances for years.
[01:53:23.086 --> 01:53:26.591]  Without burying items underground or wrapping them in aluminum foil.
[01:53:26.591 --> 01:53:31.978]  Unlike other preps, SOLARC is used every day to help offset your electric bill automatically.
[01:53:31.978 --> 01:53:36.905]  Visit PortableSolarLLC.com to learn how easily expandable the system is.

[01:53:40.290 --> 01:53:45.194]  The whole system even fits in the back of a pickup or SUV and can install in less than an hour.
[01:53:45.194 --> 01:53:50.978]  See for yourself why Solark beats other off-grid systems at PortableSolarLLC.com.

[01:53:52.379 --> 01:54:01.345]  Go to PortableSolarLLC.com to learn why Solark is energy insurance for your family.
[01:54:01.345 --> 01:54:04.107]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:54:04.107 --> 01:54:07.930]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:17.956 --> 01:54:24.518]  It's almost three o'clock in the morning Central Time.
[01:54:24.518 --> 01:54:29.178]  And we now have President-elect Donald Trump.
[01:54:29.178 --> 01:54:33.959]  Donald Trump is no angel.
[01:54:33.959 --> 01:54:43.141]  And neither am I. But Donald Trump's will is that you be prosperous and that you be successful.
[01:54:43.746 --> 01:54:47.007]  No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.
[01:54:47.007 --> 01:54:51.609]  Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.
[01:54:51.609 --> 01:54:57.151]  America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.
[01:54:57.151 --> 01:55:02.793]  And that's why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and all the big mega banks have set themselves up against him.
[01:55:02.793 --> 01:55:06.755]  Because they believe they own you.
[01:55:06.755 --> 01:55:09.296]  I knew a year and a half ago when I endorsed Donald Trump he was going to win.
[01:55:13.416 --> 01:55:17.697]  And I've talked to him about why I knew that.
[01:55:17.697 --> 01:55:33.841]  But people I know, and people I trust, that are patriots, that have defended this republic, confirmed to me, and I've seen it in Donald Trump's actions, that he wanted to restore this republic.
[01:55:33.841 --> 01:55:38.762]  But I want to be very clear to you, very clear.
[01:55:38.762 --> 01:55:41.703]  This isn't about credit, it's so that you know the danger.
[01:55:44.329 --> 01:55:47.851]  You've seen the stupid ads with the bunny rabbit that says Energizer inside.
[01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:57.017]  If you want to know what powers Donald Trump, individually, it's a love of liberty and a love of standing up to corruption.
[01:55:57.017 --> 01:55:57.617]  He's not perfect.
[01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:58.838]  Nobody is.
[01:55:58.838 --> 01:56:03.881]  But what powers the movement is Infowars.
[01:56:03.881 --> 01:56:08.484]  They want to establish a private corporate global government.
[01:56:08.484 --> 01:56:09.345]  Nigel Farage.
[01:56:11.738 --> 01:56:17.703]  The leader of UKIP would come on my show 15 years ago when he barely had a few members of parliament.
[01:56:17.703 --> 01:56:20.025]  Now he's 100 times bigger and more.
[01:56:20.025 --> 01:56:22.927]  And he would say, it's your listeners listening to you in the U.S.
[01:56:22.927 --> 01:56:24.088]  when I go knock on doors.
[01:56:24.088 --> 01:56:25.789]  That's why we're getting the UK Independence Party.
[01:56:25.789 --> 01:56:26.850]  It's Infowars.
[01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:28.011]  Thank you.
[01:56:28.011 --> 01:56:29.312]  He said that on the show.
[01:56:29.312 --> 01:56:30.313]  It's not about us bragging.
[01:56:30.313 --> 01:56:39.360]  It's that the spirit of the Infowar across the world from Australia to the UK and Russia, from Nigeria to Mexico, is spreading.
[01:56:42.014 --> 01:56:45.739]  And it's the Renaissance idea of freedom.
[01:56:45.739 --> 01:56:48.762]  And that's why they're trying to shut us down.
[01:56:48.762 --> 01:56:52.186]  Because we're not perfect, but we're not out to get people.
[01:56:52.186 --> 01:56:53.928]  We believe in lower taxes.
[01:56:53.928 --> 01:56:56.911]  We know empowering the people is the answer.
[01:56:56.911 --> 01:56:59.374]  We don't want to break up families.
[01:56:59.374 --> 01:57:00.596]  We're not out to get people.
[01:57:02.279 --> 01:57:05.440]  They are going to try to collapse the world economy.
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.401]  They've already been propping it up for a while.
[01:57:07.401 --> 01:57:09.722]  They're going to blame it on Donald Trump.
[01:57:09.722 --> 01:57:11.163]  A global depression.
[01:57:11.163 --> 01:57:13.244]  They knew they couldn't stop the movement.
[01:57:13.244 --> 01:57:17.345]  So now that he's in, they're going to implode the economy and blame him.
[01:57:17.345 --> 01:57:19.786]  Well, they're the ones who created the derivatives.
[01:57:19.786 --> 01:57:22.347]  Well, they're the ones who created the end of Glass-Steagall.
[01:57:22.347 --> 01:57:26.029]  When Hillary Clinton and Larry Summers did it all, they're going to blame Donald Trump.
[01:57:29.164 --> 01:57:30.044]  How do I know that?
[01:57:30.044 --> 01:57:30.945]  They threatened the UK.
[01:57:30.945 --> 01:57:34.086]  They said, you try to leave this unelected thing, we'll implode your economy.
[01:57:34.086 --> 01:57:35.027]  We'll take your jobs away.
[01:57:35.027 --> 01:57:37.047]  Just like they did in Iceland or Greece.
[01:57:37.047 --> 01:57:39.008]  Some countries fold, some fight back.
[01:57:39.008 --> 01:57:40.289]  We know their plan.
[01:57:40.289 --> 01:57:43.630]  If you're just conscious and want to know the truth, it's all there.
[01:57:43.630 --> 01:57:46.291]  It's not my opinion.
[01:57:46.291 --> 01:57:47.492]  I want self-determination.
[01:57:47.492 --> 01:57:51.193]  I won't be held hostage.
[01:57:51.193 --> 01:57:54.535]  So, this isn't like buying a lottery ticket.
[01:57:56.069 --> 01:58:02.813]  Where you elect Donald Trump and beat the establishment and then expect the whole gravy train to continue on.
[01:58:02.813 --> 01:58:05.555]  Who wants this fake gravy train?
[01:58:05.555 --> 01:58:08.637]  We need to get back to what makes us human, what makes us real.
[01:58:08.637 --> 01:58:13.340]  And if we're getting ahead at the expense of some third world people, we shouldn't do it.
[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:17.662]  If we're getting ahead at the expense of our kids, we shouldn't do it.
[01:58:17.662 --> 01:58:23.406]  I saw the enemy truly against Donald Trump, spiritually hating him, so I backed him.
[01:58:25.489 --> 01:58:28.310]  Donald Trump is more a figurehead of liberty than ever before.
[01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:35.353]  And he has the Holy Ghost protecting him.
[01:58:35.353 --> 01:58:40.816]  No weapon for him to test it.
[01:58:40.816 --> 01:58:44.117]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.117 --> 01:58:46.038]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.183 --> 01:58:54.345]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:54.345 --> 01:59:01.830]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:12.756]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:59:13.277 --> 01:59:21.087]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[01:59:21.087 --> 01:59:30.440]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:32.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:22.222 --> 02:00:24.927]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:24.927 --> 02:00:30.036]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:36.147 --> 02:00:36.988]  We are live.
[02:00:36.988 --> 02:00:40.190]  It is the third hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, your host.
[02:00:40.190 --> 02:00:42.551]  For the next hour, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:00:42.551 --> 02:00:53.658]  And as Alex has been discussing, the whiny, butthurt, crybaby special snowflakes have been all over the streets again protesting against a free democratic election.
[02:00:53.658 --> 02:00:57.000]  Can you imagine anything more reprehensible?
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.162]  These people should move to North Korea.
[02:00:59.162 --> 02:01:01.723]  They won't have any problems with elections there.
[02:01:01.723 --> 02:01:04.225]  Their preferred candidate will always win.
[02:01:05.416 --> 02:01:09.800]  Now it's got to the point where they're burning American flags, they're attacking people on the street.
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:11.181]  You see the footage here.
[02:01:11.181 --> 02:01:15.304]  I put up this video last night, it's already got four or five hundred thousand views.
[02:01:15.304 --> 02:01:17.566]  They're really losing the narrative.
[02:01:17.566 --> 02:01:20.909]  I mean, Trump riot has been trending on Twitter all day.
[02:01:20.909 --> 02:01:31.277]  They've been vehemently debunked in their efforts to try and frame this as a legitimate protest when it is nothing less than an anti-democratic disgrace.
[02:01:31.277 --> 02:01:34.680]  These people should move to North Korea right now if this is what they're interested in.
[02:01:35.964 --> 02:01:49.373]  But isn't it funny how we were smeared all year as violent, hateful bigots, yet when it comes down to it, it's Hillary voters who turn out to be violent, hateful bigots.
[02:01:49.373 --> 02:01:54.676]  You know, it was funny how they said Trump supporters would not accept the result of this election.
[02:01:54.676 --> 02:01:56.958]  You heard that for weeks, even months.
[02:01:57.458 --> 02:02:00.203]  They said they would riot if they lost the election.
[02:02:00.203 --> 02:02:03.209]  What's the first thing that Hillary voters do?
[02:02:03.209 --> 02:02:06.595]  They don't accept the election, and they go out and riot!
[02:02:07.554 --> 02:02:23.087]  I mean, can you remember when, after Obama won the elections in 2008 and 2012, you remember when conservatives were out on the street rioting, burning American flags, attacking people, smashing up shops, destroying cop cars?
[02:02:23.087 --> 02:02:26.210]  You remember when conservatives did that after Obama won in 2008 and 2012?
[02:02:26.210 --> 02:02:27.411]  No, me neither, because it didn't happen.
[02:02:31.482 --> 02:02:35.444]  Because Conservatives accept election results.
[02:02:35.444 --> 02:02:43.729]  They don't have toys out of the pram, temper tantrums on the streets, thinking that that's going to change anything.
[02:02:43.729 --> 02:02:44.749]  It comes down to this.
[02:02:44.749 --> 02:02:47.250]  America is a meritocracy.
[02:02:47.250 --> 02:02:49.612]  America rewards hard work.
[02:02:49.612 --> 02:02:52.493]  That's what made America great in the first place.
[02:02:52.493 --> 02:02:59.137]  America doesn't reward whining, burning flags and wallowing in your imaginary oppression.
[02:03:00.111 --> 02:03:08.033]  Okay, that's why you lost, because you're lazy, self-entitled, bed-wetting crybabies.
[02:03:08.033 --> 02:03:21.016]  But they're still out on the streets, and they will be out on the streets tonight, probably throughout the entire weekend, actually believing that the Electoral College is going to look at them burning an effigy of Donald Trump's head.
[02:03:21.596 --> 02:03:25.059]  And think, oh well, we better just overturn the entire election result then.
[02:03:25.059 --> 02:03:29.342]  Because some whiny crybabies waving Mexican flags had a hissy fit.
[02:03:29.342 --> 02:03:31.764]  No, that's not how it works.
[02:03:31.764 --> 02:03:40.210]  Again, it's this entire mentality which has driven the rise of social justice warriors, this mental illness, that everybody gets a trophy.
[02:03:40.210 --> 02:03:43.173]  No, everybody doesn't get a frigging trophy.
[02:03:43.173 --> 02:03:45.534]  You have winners and losers in life.
[02:03:45.534 --> 02:03:48.497]  The winners are the people who really want it and who work for it.
[02:03:50.472 --> 02:03:52.873]  And those were the winners on November 8th.
[02:03:52.873 --> 02:03:53.954]  You were the losers.
[02:03:53.954 --> 02:03:56.396]  Get used to it, accept it, move on.
[02:03:56.396 --> 02:03:58.557]  But they're not going to move on.
[02:03:58.557 --> 02:04:00.038]  What is the next stage of this?
[02:04:00.038 --> 02:04:02.779]  That's what we're going to talk about during the next hour.
[02:04:02.779 --> 02:04:13.426]  We're also going to talk about the anti-Donald Trump hate crime wave now sweeping America that the rigged, debunked corporate media is covering up.
[02:04:14.187 --> 02:04:16.869]  Refusing to admit it's taking place.
[02:04:16.869 --> 02:04:22.653]  Of course, we saw after Brexit this big, frothing hysteria that there were hate crimes happening everywhere.
[02:04:22.653 --> 02:04:24.554]  Massive explosion, of course.
[02:04:24.554 --> 02:04:26.615]  Turned out to be complete BS.
[02:04:26.615 --> 02:04:28.737]  The reporting of hate crimes had increased.
[02:04:28.737 --> 02:04:31.238]  Actual hate crimes had not increased.
[02:04:31.238 --> 02:04:39.184]  Now, all the hate crimes that are taking place in the aftermath of this presidential election are extreme violent left-wingers, the alt-left,
[02:04:40.004 --> 02:04:47.751]  Attacking Donald Trump supporters, not only out on the streets, but also now in schools.
[02:04:47.751 --> 02:04:49.593]  We're going to get to that after the break.
[02:04:49.593 --> 02:04:54.918]  This is the third hour of the Alex Jones Show Live, breaking news at infowars.com.
[02:04:54.918 --> 02:04:55.499]  Don't go away.
[02:05:00.939 --> 02:05:06.060]  Three days after the election of Donald Trump and the reality of a Trump presidency is starting to hit home.
[02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:11.462]  For some people, this is such a devastating notion that they need to call an ambulance or even want to die.
[02:05:11.462 --> 02:05:15.363]  Well, we Trump voters care about our fellow Americans and we're pained by this.
[02:05:15.363 --> 02:05:17.263]  So let's help the Trump protesters.
[02:05:17.263 --> 02:05:19.884]  Let's try to help them recover from their devastation.
[02:05:19.884 --> 02:05:25.105]  If you see a Trump protester or a group of them, give them a diaper, hand them a binky, cover them in a blankie.
[02:05:25.105 --> 02:05:27.206]  After all, this is what you do for crying babies.
[02:05:27.526 --> 02:05:31.288]  Many of these people look like they need a hug, so give them a box of Huggies!
[02:05:31.288 --> 02:05:38.891]  We Trump voters can't stand to see our fellow Americans so depleted, so we will make sure to get as many of them a warm bottle of milk as possible.
[02:05:38.891 --> 02:05:45.394]  To make America great again, we must make sure that these babies are taken care of with plenty of diapers, binkies, and rattles.
[02:05:45.394 --> 02:05:46.974]  Don't worry Trump protesters!
[02:05:46.974 --> 02:05:50.576]  Remember, we're stronger together, even if you do have to wear a diaper.
[02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:53.857]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[02:05:53.857 --> 02:05:55.318]  This message is paid for by the Russians.
[02:05:59.861 --> 02:06:03.142]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[02:06:03.142 --> 02:06:07.223]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[02:06:07.223 --> 02:06:09.884]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[02:06:09.884 --> 02:06:12.725]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[02:06:12.725 --> 02:06:17.907]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[02:06:18.447 --> 02:06:24.675]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[02:06:24.675 --> 02:06:26.157]  God was in school.
[02:06:26.157 --> 02:06:28.139]  Morality had a future.
[02:06:28.139 --> 02:06:30.943]  And the beef was for supper.
[02:06:30.943 --> 02:06:33.526]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[02:06:33.886 --> 02:06:35.066]  We're the solution!
[02:06:35.066 --> 02:06:36.046]  Americans!
[02:06:36.046 --> 02:06:37.547]  Ain't nothing more to it than that!
[02:06:37.547 --> 02:06:42.768]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[02:06:42.768 --> 02:06:44.588]  The ethical screening's on demand.
[02:06:44.588 --> 02:06:46.188]  DVD's now available.
[02:06:46.188 --> 02:06:50.109]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[02:06:50.109 --> 02:06:52.930]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[02:06:52.930 --> 02:06:55.710]  Americans need to see this film.
[02:06:55.710 --> 02:06:58.371]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[02:06:58.371 --> 02:06:59.231]  Let's fix it.
[02:06:59.871 --> 02:07:03.072]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:07:03.072 --> 02:07:05.413]  Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:05.413 --> 02:07:12.416]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[02:07:12.416 --> 02:07:17.738]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[02:07:17.738 --> 02:07:26.702]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[02:07:27.162 --> 02:07:36.046]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:07:36.046 --> 02:07:43.129]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[02:07:43.129 --> 02:07:48.512]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you the best.
[02:07:48.792 --> 02:07:50.453]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.351 --> 02:08:23.593]  We are back on the third hour of this Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:23.593 --> 02:08:29.775]  And there's an anti-Trump hate crime wave sweeping America, which the rigged media won't talk about.
[02:08:29.775 --> 02:08:45.720]  They'll have their cameraman on video, pretending to be an anti-Trump agitator, saying that Hillary Clinton needs to sue the United States and overturn the election result, and claim that that's an organic, authentic protester, when it's their own cameraman, because CNN is rigged.
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:47.101]  We're going to go to that video later.
[02:08:48.348 --> 02:08:49.769]  But they're not reporting on this.
[02:08:49.769 --> 02:08:51.330]  Headline up on m4wars.com.
[02:08:51.330 --> 02:08:54.711]  Video high school girl viciously attacked for supporting Donald Trump.
[02:08:54.711 --> 02:08:57.113]  Of course, this is also up on drudgereport.com.
[02:08:58.049 --> 02:08:59.769]  And this is just one example.
[02:08:59.769 --> 02:09:11.211]  Of course, we also had up on Infowars yesterday, a school in Stafford, an 11-year-old boy, this is in Texas, was violently attacked after telling classmates he voted for Donald Trump.
[02:09:11.211 --> 02:09:12.492]  You can see this video here.
[02:09:12.492 --> 02:09:14.232]  This is the girl being attacked.
[02:09:14.232 --> 02:09:15.972]  This is in California.
[02:09:15.972 --> 02:09:25.034]  Basically, this violent, intolerant liberal accused her of hating Mexicans because she posted something that was pro-Trump on Instagram.
[02:09:25.794 --> 02:09:30.081]  And within two minutes, instantly launched into a brutal assault.
[02:09:30.081 --> 02:09:33.707]  Because she's a tolerant, peaceful liberal.
[02:09:33.707 --> 02:09:36.091]  If this was an isolated incident, it would be one thing.
[02:09:36.091 --> 02:09:36.572]  But it isn't.
[02:09:37.659 --> 02:09:48.762]  Again, Stafford, Texas, 11-year-old boy violently attacked after telling classmates he voted for Donald Trump in the school's mock election, leaving him having to use crutches.
[02:09:48.762 --> 02:10:01.745]  Another incident out of Florida, 17-year-old student punched by a classmate, punched by a tolerant liberal, excuse me, in the face because he was holding a Donald Trump sign during gym class.
[02:10:02.597 --> 02:10:08.325]  We played the video yesterday of the guy in Chicago, dragged out of his car, beaten!
[02:10:09.534 --> 02:10:14.137]  By a mob of people as they decry the fact that he voted for Donald Trump.
[02:10:14.137 --> 02:10:16.659]  You voted for Trump, this is what you're going to get.
[02:10:16.659 --> 02:10:25.104]  Beat him round the head, rob his possessions, his arm gets stuck in the window of the vehicle, it drives off, dragging him down the street.
[02:10:25.104 --> 02:10:27.486]  Can you imagine if the roles were reversed?
[02:10:27.486 --> 02:10:31.329]  It looked like an actual lynching by the end of this sea.
[02:10:31.329 --> 02:10:33.430]  And you can see the video, we're playing it right now.
[02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:34.871]  Can you imagine if the roles were reversed?
[02:10:34.871 --> 02:10:38.794]  Can you imagine if a group of aggressive, intolerant Trump supporters
[02:10:39.761 --> 02:10:51.748]  Had basically dragged an African-American guy, a Hillary voter, out of his car and sort of beaten him round the head, robbing him, and then literally dragging him in the streets, hanging off the back of a car.
[02:10:51.748 --> 02:10:53.949]  That would be a nationwide news story.
[02:10:53.949 --> 02:10:55.390]  It would be all over the place.
[02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:57.171]  It would be all over CNN.
[02:10:57.171 --> 02:10:58.332]  Has CNN reported on this?
[02:10:58.332 --> 02:10:59.472]  No.
[02:10:59.472 --> 02:11:00.173]  ABC News?
[02:11:00.173 --> 02:11:00.473]  No.
[02:11:00.473 --> 02:11:00.953]  NBC?
[02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:01.333]  No.
[02:11:01.333 --> 02:11:02.934]  Nobody's reported on it.
[02:11:02.934 --> 02:11:04.015]  And it's part of a pattern.
[02:11:05.686 --> 02:11:12.593]  New Orleans, a famous monument daubed in graffiti that reads, Die White, Die!
[02:11:12.593 --> 02:11:16.817]  Again, another tolerant liberal, obviously responsible for that message.
[02:11:16.817 --> 02:11:19.240]  We've had the death threats flooding Twitter.
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:22.803]  You can go on Twitter at any point, type in a saturnate trump.
[02:11:22.803 --> 02:11:29.029]  Hundreds of thousands of death threats, some of them direct death threats from tolerant liberals
[02:11:29.850 --> 02:11:36.975]  Who for the past three, four weeks have been saying, oh, those aggressive, intolerant Trump supporters, they're not going to accept the election result.
[02:11:36.975 --> 02:11:37.675]  They're going to riot.
[02:11:37.675 --> 02:11:39.477]  They're going to stage violence.
[02:11:39.477 --> 02:11:45.981]  When it's Hillary voters now staging violence in the aftermath of them not accepting the election result.
[02:11:45.981 --> 02:11:51.985]  New York Post reports, assassination threats against Trump flood Twitter after election shocker.
[02:11:51.985 --> 02:11:53.366]  You can see more in that article.
[02:11:54.155 --> 02:12:01.681]  And they're basically out there saying, oh no, don't assassinate Trump because then Mike Pence will become president and he's even worse.
[02:12:01.681 --> 02:12:04.083]  We have to assassinate him too.
[02:12:04.083 --> 02:12:06.325]  They're actually on Twitter saying this.
[02:12:06.325 --> 02:12:07.526]  It's no surprise to us.
[02:12:07.526 --> 02:12:11.890]  I mean, I've been cataloging death threats against Trump for over a year now.
[02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:15.252]  I mean, that's why he started wearing a bulletproof vest in the first place.
[02:12:15.252 --> 02:12:21.698]  Because of all these peaceful, tolerant liberals that don't threaten to kill you if you disagree with them politically.
[02:12:22.563 --> 02:12:41.838]  So you've got a national hate crime wave sweeping America, and isn't it ironic that Hillary Clinton, during the debate, in fact it was during that infamous alt-right speech where she directly called out Alex Jones, Hillary said that Donald Trump was the cause of bullying in schools.
[02:12:42.964 --> 02:12:46.486]  Well look at what's happening now in the aftermath of this election.
[02:12:46.486 --> 02:12:53.511]  It's kids being bullied, being violently bullied in schools because they supported Donald Trump.
[02:12:53.511 --> 02:12:58.434]  Again, everything they project on us, they're responsible for it.
[02:12:58.434 --> 02:13:01.936]  Hateful, intolerant violence.
[02:13:01.936 --> 02:13:04.578]  This is the new regressive left.
[02:13:04.578 --> 02:13:07.840]  There are very few actual real liberals calling them out.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:11.282]  There are a few, and we give them honourable mentions when they do it.
[02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:15.042]  But by no means are there enough.
[02:13:15.042 --> 02:13:17.623]  So again, you've got riots across America.
[02:13:17.623 --> 02:13:19.645]  Portland, San Diego, Los Angeles.
[02:13:19.645 --> 02:13:21.966]  There'll be more tonight, don't worry about that.
[02:13:21.966 --> 02:13:25.709]  George Soros and MoveOn.org have got this planned to a fine tee!
[02:13:27.130 --> 02:13:29.392]  Again, the media is pretending it's an organic protest.
[02:13:29.392 --> 02:13:31.073]  It's not an organic protest.
[02:13:31.073 --> 02:13:37.659]  They literally have news networks trying to hire people to play the role of anti-Trump agitators so they can interview them.
[02:13:37.659 --> 02:13:45.626]  They've got CNN interviewing their own cameraman and claiming it's an organic anti-Trump protester.
[02:13:45.626 --> 02:13:50.410]  You've got moveon.org on their own website saying this is what we're going to do following these orders.
[02:13:50.410 --> 02:13:52.592]  Bussing them in to Austin.
[02:13:52.592 --> 02:13:54.353]  We had that article up on infowars.com.
[02:13:55.353 --> 02:14:08.562]  And again, this Trump-riot trend is yet another example of how the alt-left, the social justice warriors, the regressive left, is infinitely more dangerous, violent, and intolerant than the alt-right.
[02:14:08.562 --> 02:14:18.950]  We had an entire election campaign of the media demonizing the alt-right as this violent, bigoted force that's going to stage violence and start attacking people.
[02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:20.391]  Well look who's attacking people.
[02:14:20.951 --> 02:14:23.132]  It's actually the alt-left.
[02:14:23.132 --> 02:14:24.412]  It's your people.
[02:14:24.412 --> 02:14:34.995]  It's the monsters that you created with all this hysterical media coverage for the past year, saying that Donald Trump is literally Hitler, that he's going to destroy the world.
[02:14:34.995 --> 02:14:38.356]  Penny, penny, the sky is falling.
[02:14:38.356 --> 02:14:39.376]  You created that!
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:47.304]  And that's why they're now having to frame it as some kind of organic, natural protest that is legitimate.
[02:14:47.304 --> 02:14:48.585]  It's not legitimate.
[02:14:48.585 --> 02:14:52.348]  You had the Daily Beast come out and say, oh, look at Trump.
[02:14:52.348 --> 02:14:59.534]  He's already showing himself to be anti-free press, anti-freedom of assembly, because he decried these protests.
[02:15:00.299 --> 02:15:06.763]  They're not protests when they're burning down shops, smashing windows, attacking people on the street.
[02:15:06.763 --> 02:15:08.144]  That's a riot!
[02:15:08.144 --> 02:15:10.045]  That's criminal behaviour!
[02:15:10.045 --> 02:15:12.666]  It's not a protest!
[02:15:12.666 --> 02:15:18.650]  But again, because the leftist media is wedded to these people, I mean, they incited them in the first place.
[02:15:18.650 --> 02:15:26.674]  The media is responsible for inciting these riots because of their hysterical rhetoric about Donald Trump being a fascist.
[02:15:26.674 --> 02:15:27.735]  They all believe it!
[02:15:28.476 --> 02:15:31.438]  They've all got moral, righteous indignation.
[02:15:31.438 --> 02:15:38.022]  They're all out on the streets thinking that they're actually some kind of anti-fascist revolutionary force.
[02:15:38.022 --> 02:15:43.485]  Like they're fighting against the occupation in France by the Nazis.
[02:15:43.485 --> 02:15:45.646]  And the media has done that to this people.
[02:15:45.646 --> 02:15:55.332]  In fact, let's go to that video now of the black bloc anarchist who probably is a 25 year old virgin who lives in his mom's basement and has never had a job.
[02:15:56.582 --> 02:16:01.106]  Smashing an electrical box with what looks like a baseball bat.
[02:16:01.106 --> 02:16:03.268]  Let's go to that video now, I'll talk over it.
[02:16:03.268 --> 02:16:06.731]  Again, this was last night.
[02:16:06.731 --> 02:16:08.012]  Look at him.
[02:16:08.012 --> 02:16:12.516]  Attacking an electrical box with dozens of people surrounding him.
[02:16:12.516 --> 02:16:16.299]  And then one of them sees some sense and tries to stop him.
[02:16:16.299 --> 02:16:17.520]  This woman.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:19.222]  But then he starts attacking the woman.
[02:16:21.121 --> 02:16:24.344]  This is the tolerant, peaceful, loving left.
[02:16:24.344 --> 02:16:26.786]  This is from the Trump riot.
[02:16:26.786 --> 02:16:28.788]  But again, you won't see that on CNN.
[02:16:28.788 --> 02:16:37.697]  They'll call it, they'll say it was largely peaceful, as shops are being smashed in, attacking bus stations, burning American flags.
[02:16:38.257 --> 02:16:39.518]  Attacking people in the street.
[02:16:39.518 --> 02:16:43.362]  The media will say, oh there are a few disturbances but largely peaceful.
[02:16:43.362 --> 02:16:44.303]  Largely peaceful.
[02:16:44.303 --> 02:16:45.624]  Legitimate protest.
[02:16:45.624 --> 02:16:47.486]  No, not legitimate.
[02:16:47.486 --> 02:16:52.811]  They're literally protesting against the idea of free democratic elections.
[02:16:52.811 --> 02:16:54.233]  Okay?
[02:16:54.233 --> 02:16:56.335]  F off to North Korea.
[02:16:56.335 --> 02:16:58.577]  You'll really like it there.
[02:16:58.577 --> 02:17:02.701]  But again, this is another example of the violent, intolerant left that the media
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:13.633]  ...has given legitimacy to over the past year, has incited with this hysterical extremist rhetoric about how Donald Trump is literally Hitler.
[02:17:13.633 --> 02:17:16.977]  And we're going to have some more videos of that, probably in the next segment now.
[02:17:16.977 --> 02:17:18.059]  But what's the end game?
[02:17:19.588 --> 02:17:38.717]  Well, now they're out arguing that because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, which isn't even true at this point, they haven't counted 8% of the vote which is largely in Republican areas, so by the end of this, when it's all wrapped up, Donald Trump could have won the popular vote anyway.
[02:17:38.717 --> 02:17:40.177]  But again, that's the mantra.
[02:17:40.177 --> 02:17:43.439]  This is directly from MoveOn.org, from George Soros.
[02:17:44.278 --> 02:17:54.925]  Oh, Hillary won the popular vote, therefore we need to put pressure on the Electoral College to change the rules of the game after the game has finished.
[02:17:54.925 --> 02:18:03.872]  They're literally trying to overturn the results of a free democratic election like some third world dictatorship.
[02:18:03.872 --> 02:18:06.754]  This is out of the New York Post.
[02:18:06.754 --> 02:18:09.836]  The one scenario that could still get Hillary into the White House.
[02:18:10.947 --> 02:18:23.060]  For diehard Democrats holding out hope that they won't have to live through a Trump presidency, God forbid, literally Hitler, there is a last incredibly long shot for them to latch onto a surprise twist in the Electoral College.
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:31.168]  And it basically talks about putting pressure on members of the Electoral College to not vote in line with how the states voted.
[02:18:31.869 --> 02:18:40.516]  In the presidential election, there are actually Tumblr websites, petitions, frothing SJWs everywhere devoted to this.
[02:18:40.516 --> 02:18:45.100]  They actually think they can overturn the results of a democratic election.
[02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:48.003]  These people are authoritarians, okay?
[02:18:48.003 --> 02:18:55.189]  They wouldn't be out of place in Venezuela or North Korea or Communist China.
[02:18:55.189 --> 02:18:57.411]  That's the spirit that runs through these people.
[02:18:59.104 --> 02:19:00.284]  There you see the meme.
[02:19:00.284 --> 02:19:04.706]  Claim Trump is going to destroy America as they go out and destroy America.
[02:19:04.706 --> 02:19:06.646]  Again, it's all reflection.
[02:19:06.646 --> 02:19:08.767]  It's all projection.
[02:19:08.767 --> 02:19:10.988]  What they accuse you of, they're doing.
[02:19:10.988 --> 02:19:12.768]  They're planning.
[02:19:12.768 --> 02:19:16.870]  They're trying to actually overturn the results of the Democratic election.
[02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:18.470]  We saw it with Brexit.
[02:19:18.470 --> 02:19:20.191]  Don't think this is not a threat, okay?
[02:19:21.856 --> 02:19:27.985]  17 million people in the United Kingdom, a majority in the vote of 52%, voted for Brexit.
[02:19:27.985 --> 02:19:31.410]  We were told beforehand the government will implement your vote.
[02:19:31.410 --> 02:19:32.152]  Look what happened.
[02:19:33.168 --> 02:19:38.132]  They got lawyers, they got political class insiders to take it to the High Court.
[02:19:38.132 --> 02:19:40.713]  Now it looks like it's going to go to a parliamentary vote.
[02:19:40.713 --> 02:19:42.635]  They're going to vote against it.
[02:19:42.635 --> 02:19:47.999]  They're going to annul the democratic will of the British people, or at least attempt to.
[02:19:47.999 --> 02:19:56.144]  And that's what leftists and social justice warriors, funded by billionaire elitist George Soros, are trying to do in the United States.
[02:19:56.144 --> 02:19:57.185]  We'll get into it after the break.
[02:19:57.185 --> 02:19:58.746]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:19:58.746 --> 02:19:59.167]  Stay tuned.
[02:20:00.467 --> 02:20:05.248]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[02:20:05.248 --> 02:20:11.130]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[02:20:11.130 --> 02:20:17.632]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[02:20:17.632 --> 02:20:21.613]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[02:21:14.994 --> 02:21:15.795]  You heard me right.
[02:21:15.795 --> 02:21:17.977]  Five ounces of silver below cost.
[02:21:17.977 --> 02:21:19.278]  No credit card fees.
[02:21:19.278 --> 02:21:19.899]  Free shipping.

[02:21:39.558 --> 02:21:41.099]  The secret is being suppressed.
[02:21:41.099 --> 02:21:43.319]  The price could explode at any time.
[02:21:43.319 --> 02:21:44.019]  Call today at 800-328-1860.

[02:21:47.401 --> 02:21:48.401]  Call now before it's too late.
[02:21:48.401 --> 02:21:48.441]  800-328-1860.
[02:22:00.322 --> 02:22:01.122]  My name is Liam.
[02:22:01.122 --> 02:22:01.782]  I'm 41.
[02:22:01.782 --> 02:22:04.643]  I've been using One World Way for two and a half years now.
[02:22:04.643 --> 02:22:08.904]  I suffered a bulged L4 and L5 disc from a car accident three years ago.
[02:22:08.904 --> 02:22:16.846]  And since that time, I've been unable to walk long distances, do any minor lifting, or just normal activities with my children without having severe back pain.
[02:22:16.846 --> 02:22:22.948]  Since I've started using One World Way, I've been able to walk more, engage in activities with my children, and have less lower back pain.
[02:22:23.428 --> 02:22:27.871]  One World Whey has helped me regain back my strength, confidence, and have a healthier life.
[02:22:27.871 --> 02:22:33.694]  I've noticed a weight loss of about 20 pounds, my A1C dropped two points, and I have more energy now.
[02:22:33.694 --> 02:22:36.336]  One World Whey has helped me regain back my life.
[02:22:36.336 --> 02:22:43.140]  The results for clients on One World Whey have surpassed the results for most any other supplements as well as all other whey protein powders.
[02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:45.762]  One World Whey is non-denatured and frequency encoded.
[02:22:45.922 --> 02:22:50.684]  We believe the frequency encoding increases your body's production of glutathione and energy production.
[02:22:50.684 --> 02:22:56.186]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:22:56.186 --> 02:22:59.307]  That's OneWorldWay.com.
[02:22:59.307 --> 02:23:02.908]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[02:23:02.908 --> 02:23:05.269]  How would you like to never be cold again?
[02:23:05.269 --> 02:23:11.371]  This is Dale with Fortress Clothing, and I'm here to tell you, you will never be cold again with Fortress.
[02:23:12.119 --> 02:23:22.006]  If you're tired of freezing your butt off, elk hunting, sitting in a tree stand deer hunting, winter camping, fishing, ice fishing, no longer fear the cold.
[02:23:22.006 --> 02:23:26.029]  If you snowmobile, ski, snowboard, get Fortress.
[02:23:26.029 --> 02:23:32.674]  Sledding with the kids, shoveling the walks, shopping, or if you or your spouse get cold feet at home, get Fortress.
[02:23:32.674 --> 02:23:41.040]  If you're stuck outside working in the cold, or find yourself in an emergency situation, get our winter bug out bag, and you will never be cold again.
[02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:45.703]  Fortress is the answer, so quit complaining and go to FortressClothing.com.

[02:23:55.251 --> 02:24:01.396]  FortressClothing.com.
[02:24:01.396 --> 02:24:08.942]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry
[02:24:15.743 --> 02:24:21.328]  Martin Luther King once said, a riot is the language of the unheard.
[02:24:21.328 --> 02:24:25.891]  Well now it's just the language of butthurt losers and criminal thugs.
[02:24:25.891 --> 02:24:29.874]  We've seen more riots last night, we'll see more riots tonight, and this is the end game.
[02:24:29.874 --> 02:24:32.756]  This is what Michael Moore is calling for as well, which we'll get on to.
[02:24:33.777 --> 02:24:42.425]  They're trying to argue that because Hillary won the popular vote, which for one they haven't counted 8% of the results, that's not even known yet.
[02:24:42.425 --> 02:24:52.835]  Number two, she won 47% of the vote, so the majority of Americans who voted did not vote for Hillary Clinton, whichever way you want to splice it.
[02:24:53.576 --> 02:25:04.472]  They're trying to argue that they can go to the Electoral College and put pressure on these people to overturn the fair and free results of a democratic election.
[02:25:04.472 --> 02:25:07.357]  What does that tell you about these people?
[02:25:08.248 --> 02:25:14.613]  Again, would they have whined if Trump had won the popular vote but Hillary had won the election?
[02:25:14.613 --> 02:25:16.175]  Would they have complained about that?
[02:25:16.175 --> 02:25:23.200]  No, they wouldn't have said a damn word because they want to change the rules of the game after they've already lost the game.
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:26.643]  I mean, it's like in American football.
[02:25:26.643 --> 02:25:33.049]  I mean, you can't argue that a field goal should have been worth six points after you've already lost the game.
[02:25:33.049 --> 02:25:34.230]  It doesn't work like that.
[02:25:34.943 --> 02:25:35.724]  You lost.
[02:25:35.724 --> 02:25:37.545]  You knew the rules of the game going in.
[02:25:37.545 --> 02:25:38.305]  You lost.
[02:25:38.305 --> 02:25:39.186]  Accept it.
[02:25:39.186 --> 02:25:39.986]  Move on.
[02:25:39.986 --> 02:25:49.033]  But they're not going to accept it because these people are violent, hateful, intolerant, authoritarian thugs controlled from the very top.
[02:25:49.033 --> 02:25:50.314]  This is not organic.
[02:25:50.314 --> 02:25:51.695]  This is moveon.org.
[02:25:51.695 --> 02:26:00.461]  This is, again, the so-called anarchists doing the bidding of a billionaire, globalist, elitist in George Soros.
[02:26:01.061 --> 02:26:05.022]  How does that reconcile with them claiming to be anarchists?
[02:26:05.022 --> 02:26:06.323]  It doesn't!
[02:26:06.323 --> 02:26:11.104]  If Hillary Clinton had won, would all these anarchists and communists be out on the streets right now?
[02:26:11.104 --> 02:26:13.005]  No, they wouldn't!
[02:26:13.005 --> 02:26:18.867]  Yet she's the ultimate Wall Street insider, the ultimate embodiment of the political class.
[02:26:18.867 --> 02:26:21.548]  Would they have been out on the street protesting her election?
[02:26:21.548 --> 02:26:22.368]  No way!
[02:26:23.695 --> 02:26:25.696]  You're not anarchist, you're not communist.
[02:26:25.696 --> 02:26:31.678]  I mean, you can disagree with those people, but if they legitimately have those beliefs, fair enough, whatever.
[02:26:31.678 --> 02:26:32.999]  But you're not even that.
[02:26:32.999 --> 02:26:39.942]  You're complete hypocrites and the kind of tactics that they employ at this point border on domestic terrorism.
[02:26:39.942 --> 02:26:45.344]  This is straight out of the Bill Ayres playbook, The Weather Underground.
[02:26:45.344 --> 02:26:50.966]  Remember Larry Grathwald infiltrated The Weather Underground, said that their ultimate plan for people who don't agree with them
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:56.681]  is to put their ideological opponents in concentration camps.
[02:26:56.681 --> 02:27:03.923]  And when you talk to social justice warriors, when you dare to disagree with social justice warriors, that's the end game of their ideology.
[02:27:03.923 --> 02:27:13.046]  Because they're violent, intolerant, hateful bigots who want to overturn the result of a democratic election by rioting in the streets.
[02:27:13.886 --> 02:27:14.687]  Newsflash!
[02:27:14.687 --> 02:27:16.048]  It's not going to happen.
[02:27:16.048 --> 02:27:22.814]  You win an election by actually not being a lazy ass and working hard for it and getting your message out.
[02:27:22.814 --> 02:27:29.900]  Not by throwing temper tantrums and throwing your toys out of the pram in the aftermath.
[02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:33.083]  But again, this is what Michael Moore's pushing.
[02:27:33.083 --> 02:27:34.384]  Progress outlook.
[02:27:35.495 --> 02:27:38.057]  The Orwellian nature of that name.
[02:27:38.057 --> 02:27:45.041]  They're trying to have the result of a democratic election overturned and they call themselves progressives.
[02:27:45.041 --> 02:27:48.444]  Has there ever been anything more Orwellian?
[02:27:48.444 --> 02:27:55.108]  Again, cancelling the democratic rights of the American people because you're butthurt and you're lost.
[02:27:55.108 --> 02:27:56.729]  That's not progressive.
[02:27:56.729 --> 02:27:58.610]  That's authoritarian.
[02:27:58.610 --> 02:28:03.674]  You should be ashamed of yourselves, as should be anyone that supports this.
[02:28:03.674 --> 02:28:05.175]  Oh, but what's Harry Reid saying?
[02:28:06.331 --> 02:28:14.016]  The outgoing, thank God, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid released a scathing statement on Friday, tearing into President-elect Donald Trump.
[02:28:14.016 --> 02:28:15.998]  This is out of Yahoo News.
[02:28:15.998 --> 02:28:22.182]  Quote, if this is going to be a time of healing, we must first put the responsibility for healing where it belongs, at the feet of Donald Trump!
[02:28:22.935 --> 02:28:27.816]  A sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fuelled his campaign with bigotry and hate.
[02:28:27.816 --> 02:28:37.939]  I've heard more stories in the past 48 hours of Americans living in fear of their own government and their fellow Americans than I can remember hearing in five decades in politics.
[02:28:37.939 --> 02:28:46.201]  Well that's strange, Harry Reid, because all I've seen over the past 48 hours is Trump supporters being violently attacked.
[02:28:47.105 --> 02:28:47.725]  Okay?
[02:28:47.725 --> 02:28:51.266]  The hateful intolerance is only coming from one side.
[02:28:51.266 --> 02:28:54.146]  And it's not Donald Trump supporters.
[02:28:54.146 --> 02:28:59.427]  How many videos of people being beaten up on the streets do we need to see to realise that?
[02:28:59.427 --> 02:29:01.727]  So, Harry Reid.
[02:29:01.727 --> 02:29:04.848]  Remember, this is the same guy who called the Bundys terrorists.
[02:29:04.848 --> 02:29:06.708]  They were all proven innocent.
[02:29:06.708 --> 02:29:11.029]  Harry Reid is accusing Donald Trump of unleashing a tide of hate.
[02:29:11.029 --> 02:29:16.270]  While Hillary voters unleash a tide of hate, riot
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:21.385]  violent brutality against Donald Trump supporters.
[02:29:21.385 --> 02:29:23.167]  Again, it's all about projection.
[02:29:24.122 --> 02:29:26.343]  They do what they accuse you of.
[02:29:26.343 --> 02:29:30.265]  They embody the very worst aspects of humanity.
[02:29:30.265 --> 02:29:35.147]  These people make me absolutely sick every single time.
[02:29:35.147 --> 02:29:44.331]  But the good news is they're so lazy and stupid that they think screaming the words bigot, misogynist and racist are actually going to give them political success.
[02:29:44.331 --> 02:29:44.831]  It doesn't.
[02:29:44.831 --> 02:29:45.412]  You failed.
[02:29:45.412 --> 02:29:45.932]  You lost.
[02:29:45.932 --> 02:29:47.132]  We'll be back after this.
[02:29:47.132 --> 02:29:47.653]  Stay tuned.
[02:29:49.505 --> 02:29:52.531]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.531 --> 02:29:56.138]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.563 --> 02:30:04.784]  The NFL is considering some serious changes as ratings continue to plummet.
[02:30:04.784 --> 02:30:11.506]  Some of the changes include reducing ads and ad time, reducing the time of game, to perhaps even changing the way it's officiated.
[02:30:11.506 --> 02:30:26.231]  These were among the things mentioned by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to increase ratings, but he failed to mention the protest of our country by some of its players, like Colin Paperneck, Erika Reid, Kenny Schills, Jackie Tartt, Elizabeth Harreld, and Luz Irving.
[02:30:26.471 --> 02:30:31.393]  Who have been protesting the country during the National Anthem, which without a doubt is affecting ratings.
[02:30:31.393 --> 02:30:37.115]  Wait, the players of the league are protesting the people in the country who drive the high ratings, and the ratings are dropping?
[02:30:37.115 --> 02:30:37.795]  Shocking!
[02:30:37.795 --> 02:30:40.296]  But the PCNFL can't address this.
[02:30:40.296 --> 02:30:54.702]  Perhaps the silver lining in all of this is that people are less inclined to being obsessed with football all day long, and have been following the presidential election, as well as other local and national issues, that they see they can affect with vigilance and action, not just taking a knee.
[02:30:55.262 --> 02:30:57.484]  This is Owen Troyer from InfoWars.com.
[02:31:17.737 --> 02:31:19.618]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:31:19.618 --> 02:31:21.459]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:31:21.459 --> 02:31:22.499]  I popped two of them.
[02:31:22.499 --> 02:31:24.781]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:31:24.781 --> 02:31:26.602]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:31:26.602 --> 02:31:28.242]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:31:28.242 --> 02:31:29.583]  People really love it.
[02:31:29.583 --> 02:31:30.183]  Read about it.
[02:31:30.183 --> 02:31:34.005]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[02:31:34.005 --> 02:31:39.288]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:31:39.468 --> 02:31:43.513]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce.
[02:31:43.513 --> 02:31:49.661]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[02:31:49.661 --> 02:31:55.588]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:59.758 --> 02:32:00.258]  Not a group.
[02:32:00.258 --> 02:32:01.719]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:32:01.719 --> 02:32:03.039]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:32:03.039 --> 02:32:04.240]  Why is this so good?
[02:32:04.240 --> 02:32:09.522]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:09.522 --> 02:32:23.068]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:23.068 --> 02:32:24.429]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:32:25.209 --> 02:32:26.850]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:32:26.850 --> 02:32:29.431]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:29.431 --> 02:32:30.732]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:30.732 --> 02:32:31.833]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:32:31.833 --> 02:32:33.173]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:33.173 --> 02:32:37.676]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:37.676 --> 02:32:40.937]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:40.937 --> 02:32:44.019]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:44.019 --> 02:32:45.080]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:47.001]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:47.001 --> 02:32:48.021]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:32:48.021 --> 02:32:50.743]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:50.743 --> 02:32:50.943]  And, uh,
[02:32:51.604 --> 02:32:52.646]  You support the broadcast.
[02:32:52.646 --> 02:32:53.969]  Infowarslives.com.
[02:32:53.969 --> 02:32:56.234]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:56.234 --> 02:32:58.178]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[02:33:15.427 --> 02:33:17.208]  We are on the march.
[02:33:17.208 --> 02:33:20.370]  The empire is on the run.
[02:33:20.370 --> 02:33:30.916]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:30.916 --> 02:33:39.681]  The same rigged media that incited these riots in the first place with their hysterical propaganda about Donald Trump being literally Hitler
[02:33:40.953 --> 02:34:01.226]  Has not only created the conditions to legitimise those riots, as they did with Ferguson and the whole Black Lives Matter issue, they're now literally rigging, hoaxing media segments to create this narrative that these people have a legitimate grievance and that Hillary Clinton should demand that the election result be overturned.
[02:34:01.226 --> 02:34:06.870]  They're actually hoaxing media segments to try and run that scam on live television.
[02:34:07.390 --> 02:34:08.651]  We're going to go to that clip in a minute.
[02:34:08.651 --> 02:34:19.196]  I just want to tell you about the products at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com because we've extended the election super specials to help defend liberty.
[02:34:19.196 --> 02:34:27.740]  We're now sold out of many of the InfoWarsLife formulas like Knockout, but we have extended most of our top-selling super specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:34.024]  There's no question that Hillary and the globalists will not lay down and accept defeat and a counter-attack is imminent.
[02:34:34.904 --> 02:34:43.871]  As I just explained, it's already happening with the riots, with the demands for Hillary to ask that the election result be overturned.
[02:34:43.871 --> 02:34:44.871]  We need to keep fighting.
[02:34:44.871 --> 02:34:45.852]  This is only the beginning.
[02:34:45.852 --> 02:34:48.374]  I told you about this with Brexit and look what happened.
[02:34:48.374 --> 02:34:50.555]  They're trying to overturn Brexit.
[02:34:50.555 --> 02:34:53.978]  They may even try to overturn this if we don't stay on the front foot.
[02:34:55.049 --> 02:34:59.331]  And of course you can help us do that by getting the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:34:59.331 --> 02:35:04.052]  Help defend liberty and support InfoWars against coming attacks, while getting super high quality products.
[02:35:04.052 --> 02:35:07.834]  And you can go on the website, read the 5-star reviews.
[02:35:07.834 --> 02:35:11.435]  We don't have time to fake our own reviews like a lot of websites do.
[02:35:11.435 --> 02:35:19.158]  They're authentic, original 5-star reviews from people who have got the products, and who are really having benefits from them.
[02:35:19.158 --> 02:35:20.658]  30% off Supermail Vitality.

[02:35:26.814 --> 02:35:30.397]  Again, the government's storing food, why shouldn't you do it?
[02:35:30.397 --> 02:35:33.800]  If nothing happens, then you just eat the food and you save a ton of money anyway.
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:35.221]  It's win-win.
[02:35:35.221 --> 02:35:38.124]  30% off Survival Shield X2.
[02:35:38.124 --> 02:35:41.787]  30% off Pro Pure King water filters.
[02:35:41.787 --> 02:35:45.210]  And 15% off all Molon Labe apparel.
[02:35:45.210 --> 02:35:47.893]  Those great t-shirts, conversation starters, and again,
[02:35:48.473 --> 02:35:57.598]  We're not funded by MoveOn.org, we're not funded to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by George Soros, yet we're kicking his ass on a daily basis.
[02:35:57.598 --> 02:35:58.719]  Why is that?
[02:35:58.719 --> 02:36:00.880]  It's thanks to you getting the products.
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:02.361]  This is not a cliche.
[02:36:02.361 --> 02:36:05.843]  When I started working here, there were literally two employees.
[02:36:05.843 --> 02:36:07.964]  And that wasn't even that long ago.
[02:36:07.964 --> 02:36:10.306]  You know, 10, 11, 12 years ago.
[02:36:10.306 --> 02:36:12.287]  Look at what we've achieved after that.
[02:36:13.047 --> 02:36:21.593]  And it's solely down to you supporting us, helping us to grow this network by getting the product at infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:21.593 --> 02:36:28.298]  So please continue to support us as we move forward in this battle, in this war.
[02:36:28.298 --> 02:36:30.619]  And the election was only part of the battle.
[02:36:30.619 --> 02:36:31.720]  The battle goes on.
[02:36:33.069 --> 02:36:52.175]  And it goes on with the rigged media now trying to hoax this narrative that Hillary Clinton has a legitimate grievance that she should be president, that they're going to try and pressure the Electoral College into changing the rules after the game's already finished by just handing her the presidency.
[02:36:52.175 --> 02:36:59.198]  Yes, it's extremely unlikely, but if we allow this narrative to gain a foothold, it's only going to grow like a tumour.
[02:36:59.198 --> 02:37:00.058]  So this is CNN.
[02:37:01.573 --> 02:37:09.576]  Interviewing a supposedly organic, authentic, anti-Trump, pro-Hillary protester on the street.
[02:37:09.576 --> 02:37:24.522]  Now listen to this guy and specifically listen to the end of the interview when Don Lemon, the host, starts talking and admits that this so-called organic protester is in fact a CNN employee, a cameraman.
[02:37:24.522 --> 02:37:25.402]  Let's get out to the clip.
[02:37:26.557 --> 02:37:31.282]  So you don't feel like this was a fair election because it looks like Donald Trump won fair and square.
[02:37:31.282 --> 02:37:32.863]  How did he win fair and square?
[02:37:32.863 --> 02:37:34.125]  Hillary had more votes.
[02:37:34.125 --> 02:37:36.367]  More human beings voted for Hillary.
[02:37:36.367 --> 02:37:37.568]  This isn't fair.
[02:37:37.568 --> 02:37:38.809]  We didn't get one vote.
[02:37:38.809 --> 02:37:39.830]  You didn't get a vote.
[02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:42.232]  It's just like back in the day when your vote was one-third.
[02:37:42.232 --> 02:37:44.775]  No, the Electoral College, there's somebody who wants to blow that up.
[02:37:44.775 --> 02:37:46.056]  You want to get rid of Electoral College?
[02:37:46.056 --> 02:37:47.237]  Just count the votes.
[02:37:47.237 --> 02:37:47.938]  It's ridiculous.
[02:37:47.938 --> 02:37:48.919]  Hillary, you're a lawyer.
[02:37:49.099 --> 02:37:52.262]  Walk in, go to the Supreme Court.
[02:37:52.262 --> 02:37:53.363]  I believe in you, Hillary.
[02:37:53.363 --> 02:37:54.384]  I've been to Rwanda.
[02:37:54.384 --> 02:37:56.286]  I've been to your hospital in Rwanda.
[02:37:56.286 --> 02:37:57.747]  I've seen all the good you've done.
[02:37:57.747 --> 02:37:58.468]  I believe in you.
[02:37:58.468 --> 02:37:59.429]  Women need you.
[02:37:59.429 --> 02:38:00.730]  Minorities need you.
[02:38:00.730 --> 02:38:01.511]  I need you.
[02:38:01.511 --> 02:38:02.452]  Chicago needs you.
[02:38:02.452 --> 02:38:03.213]  We all need you.
[02:38:03.213 --> 02:38:09.319]  This country needs you to stand up and walk into the Supreme Court and say one vote equals one vote.
[02:38:09.819 --> 02:38:10.860]  What's wrong with that?
[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:11.600]  What's the debate?
[02:38:39.178 --> 02:38:40.379]  There you have it.
[02:38:40.379 --> 02:38:43.360]  Rigged media trying to create a hoax.
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:45.301]  And you know, he kind of over-egged it, didn't he?
[02:38:45.301 --> 02:38:46.802]  I mean, let's be honest.
[02:38:46.802 --> 02:38:53.406]  He kind of gave it a bit too much when he was playing that role of this irate anti-Trump agitator.
[02:38:53.406 --> 02:38:55.387]  Has he hurt Don Lemon?
[02:38:55.387 --> 02:38:56.267]  I know that guy!
[02:38:56.267 --> 02:38:57.748]  Oh, he's our cameraman!
[02:38:57.748 --> 02:38:58.869]  Oh, really?
[02:38:58.869 --> 02:39:05.993]  So we looked him up online and a resume for John Gurkovich, who is the guy named the so-called irate anti-Trump protester,
[02:39:06.926 --> 02:39:13.653]  And what we found correlates with Lemon's statements about a cameraman working for CNN and filming in Third World Nations.
[02:39:13.653 --> 02:39:15.455]  So it is him!
[02:39:15.455 --> 02:39:28.548]  They got a CNN employee to play the role of an anti-Trump agitator to drop this narrative, this butthurt, whiny, crybaby narrative that they want to change the rules of the game after they've lost the game.
[02:39:29.793 --> 02:39:35.577]  Again, they want to pretend, they want to argue that a field goal should have been worth six points after they already got crushed.
[02:39:35.577 --> 02:39:37.999]  Well, it isn't worth six points, sorry.
[02:39:37.999 --> 02:39:41.421]  You can't just invent new rules after the game's over.
[02:39:41.421 --> 02:39:43.703]  Get over it, you lost.
[02:39:43.703 --> 02:39:46.565]  But they're going to try and continue this narrative.
[02:39:46.565 --> 02:39:48.366]  And Michael Moore is firmly on board.
[02:39:49.284 --> 02:40:03.095]  The complete hypocrite who in June 2016 said he was voting for Bernie Sanders because Hillary Clinton was the corrupt Iraq war-voting Wall Street corporate establishment candidate who he would never vote for.
[02:40:03.095 --> 02:40:06.058]  Lo and behold, four months later, oh Hillary Clinton's great!
[02:40:06.058 --> 02:40:07.499]  Everybody should go out and vote for her!
[02:40:09.318 --> 02:40:12.621]  Now, filmmaker Michael Moore, this is up on RT.
[02:40:12.621 --> 02:40:24.270]  Filmmaker Michael Moore has become a political beacon for devastated Hillary Clinton fans to move on and get S-H-I-T done after posting a five-point plan which went viral.
[02:40:24.270 --> 02:40:28.873]  And I mean, it got 400,000 Facebook likes, 880,000 shares.
[02:40:28.873 --> 02:40:33.457]  He then pointed another one, posted another one, which I put up on my Twitter.
[02:40:34.952 --> 02:40:41.797]  And he directly calls for people to follow the orders of MoveOn.org, which is owned by George Soros.
[02:40:41.797 --> 02:40:50.883]  So this is a guy who cut his teeth going after big business, going after the corrupt establishment, supposedly in the name of defending the rights of the middle class.
[02:40:51.804 --> 02:41:08.370]  Now he's openly telling people to obey George Soros, a billionaire globalist elitist who specializes in overthrowing legitimately elected governments around the world.
[02:41:08.370 --> 02:41:10.131]  And look what we have with this narrative.
[02:41:10.131 --> 02:41:14.252]  Oh, Hillary won the popular vote, even though the popular vote isn't even being counted yet.
[02:41:14.252 --> 02:41:20.775]  She should just change the rules and march right into the Oval Office, because that's not what third world dictators do at all, is it?
[02:41:21.769 --> 02:41:26.292]  But Michael Moore, the tolerant liberal, the socialist, that's what he's pushing.
[02:41:26.292 --> 02:41:40.121]  He's telling people, follow the orders of George Soros and moveon.org, get out on the streets with these violent, bigoted, hateful, intolerant goons and start smashing crap up because you didn't get your own way.
[02:41:42.096 --> 02:41:44.037]  This is a narrative they're going to move forward with.
[02:41:44.037 --> 02:41:45.098]  Here's another one.
[02:41:45.098 --> 02:41:54.224]  Gateway Pundit reports, far-left group Answer Coalition plans massive demonstration unrest during Trump inauguration.
[02:41:54.224 --> 02:42:01.828]  Of course, in January, the post-election demonstrations against Trump are being orchestrated by socialists and Marxists.
[02:42:01.828 --> 02:42:03.329]  That's why they're so violent.
[02:42:03.329 --> 02:42:08.993]  Answer Coalition, a socialist group, is planning mass protests in Washington DC during Donald Trump's inauguration.
[02:42:09.946 --> 02:42:21.329]  The group claims to be an anti-war group but has remained silent during the Obama years as he drone-bombed country after country across the Muslim world.
[02:42:21.329 --> 02:42:25.931]  When a Democrat's doing that, those bombs are peaceful.
[02:42:27.472 --> 02:42:29.233]  You can massacre Muslims across the world.
[02:42:29.233 --> 02:42:32.416]  As long as it's a humanitarian war, then it's perfectly okay.
[02:42:32.416 --> 02:42:36.079]  When George W. Bush does it, then it's horrible war crime.
[02:42:36.079 --> 02:42:36.879]  Obama does it.
[02:42:36.879 --> 02:42:38.200]  Hillary Clinton does it.
[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:45.185]  Literally destroys governments, creates an international migrant crisis, creates ISIS, arms them.
[02:42:45.185 --> 02:42:47.787]  They haven't got a damn thing to say about it.
[02:42:47.787 --> 02:42:48.948]  Answer coalition.
[02:42:48.948 --> 02:42:49.649]  Give me a break.
[02:42:50.782 --> 02:42:54.086]  The far left group announced the protest on Wednesday.
[02:42:54.086 --> 02:42:55.628]  Progressive people!
[02:42:55.628 --> 02:43:00.374]  Yeah, progressive people who want to cancel democratic elections.
[02:43:00.374 --> 02:43:02.557]  That's really progressive, isn't it?
[02:43:02.557 --> 02:43:07.503]  Progressive people from all over the country will be descending on Washington DC on January 20th.
[02:43:08.504 --> 02:43:13.211]  To stage a massive demonstration along Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day.
[02:43:13.211 --> 02:43:15.014]  So you've got ANSA pushing it.
[02:43:15.014 --> 02:43:17.918]  You've got George Soros's MoveOn.org pushing it.
[02:43:17.918 --> 02:43:19.701]  You've got CNN pushing it.
[02:43:19.701 --> 02:43:23.327]  These fake, rigged hoax interviews with their own cameraman.
[02:43:24.147 --> 02:43:26.247]  You've got Michael Moore pushing it.
[02:43:26.247 --> 02:43:29.348]  This is the narrative going forward.
[02:43:29.348 --> 02:43:41.451]  And they'll continue to get more violent if we don't get out ahead of this narrative right now and discredit it, like we did to a large extent with the Black Lives Matter, which was again the same thing.
[02:43:41.451 --> 02:43:45.912]  George Soros funded, from the top, AstroTurf fake movement.
[02:43:45.912 --> 02:43:49.712]  Not authentic, not grassroots.
[02:43:49.712 --> 02:43:52.333]  Again, it's all part of this Weatherman-Bill Ayers
[02:43:53.547 --> 02:43:55.228]  Method.
[02:43:55.228 --> 02:43:57.750]  They want to overturn the entire system.
[02:43:57.750 --> 02:44:04.934]  Their solution, their utopia, is going to look worse than anything you could ever imagine.
[02:44:04.934 --> 02:44:06.935]  These people hate capitalism.
[02:44:06.935 --> 02:44:08.596]  They hate the middle class.
[02:44:08.596 --> 02:44:11.338]  They're complete losers in their own personal lives.
[02:44:11.338 --> 02:44:14.780]  They've got nothing to live for, nothing to strive for.
[02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:20.183]  Self-entitled, whiny, butthurt losers who don't want a job.
[02:44:21.124 --> 02:44:22.905]  Don't want to get ahead in life.
[02:44:22.905 --> 02:44:24.527]  And they're control freaks at heart.
[02:44:24.527 --> 02:44:26.468]  They're authoritarians.
[02:44:26.468 --> 02:44:30.371]  That's why they lust after controlling your life.
[02:44:30.371 --> 02:44:35.255]  I mean, who has even got the time to interfere with everybody's life?
[02:44:35.255 --> 02:44:36.877]  To the extent that they do.
[02:44:36.877 --> 02:44:40.079]  With their safe spaces and their trigger warnings.
[02:44:40.079 --> 02:44:43.622]  And their being permanently offended at everything.
[02:44:43.622 --> 02:44:45.364]  These people at heart are control freaks.
[02:44:46.195 --> 02:44:49.298]  And they won't give up the reins of power very easily.
[02:44:49.298 --> 02:44:52.440]  So that's why we need to stay on the front foot with this.
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:57.724]  These riots are only going to continue unless we get ahead of this narrative.
[02:44:57.724 --> 02:45:03.589]  And again, you've seen RevCom, Revolutionary Communist Party, organizing these riots.
[02:45:03.589 --> 02:45:06.572]  The Black Bloc Anarchists.
[02:45:06.572 --> 02:45:15.539]  The 25-year-old unemployed virgins living in their mom's basement, decrying the system while doing nothing about it, smoking weed all day,
[02:45:16.917 --> 02:45:20.458]  I mean, they barely even engage in hashtag activism anymore.
[02:45:20.458 --> 02:45:22.719]  They're that lazy.
[02:45:22.719 --> 02:45:27.541]  It's like as Stefan Molyneux said, you know, FDR won the election because of radio.
[02:45:27.541 --> 02:45:31.343]  JFK won the election, the presidency, because of television.
[02:45:31.343 --> 02:45:34.944]  Donald Trump won the presidency because of social media.
[02:45:34.944 --> 02:45:42.687]  In fact, you even had the Daily Beast yesterday saying that myself, Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich, Chuck Johnson, Molyneux, we were all
[02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:48.543]  To a great deal responsible in terms of social media for helping Trump win the presidency.
[02:45:48.543 --> 02:45:54.667]  Because we actually work hard, we care, we strive to win.
[02:45:54.667 --> 02:46:05.013]  We don't lay around being butthurt, whiny, self-entitled losers who are too lazy to do it in the moment and then when they fail they go out and smash crap up.
[02:46:05.013 --> 02:46:06.354]  That's not how it works.
[02:46:06.354 --> 02:46:09.516]  That's not how you get ahead in life, okay?
[02:46:09.516 --> 02:46:11.978]  Again, assassination threats flooding Twitter.
[02:46:13.615 --> 02:46:14.615]  Ron Paul has come out.
[02:46:14.615 --> 02:46:17.037]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[02:46:17.037 --> 02:46:19.438]  This is what I said a couple of days ago as well.
[02:46:19.438 --> 02:46:24.620]  Ron Paul, Trump needs to resist neocons and shadow government elites.
[02:46:24.620 --> 02:46:34.085]  He said, unfortunately, there's been several neoconservatives that are getting closer to Trump, and if he gets his advice from them, then I do not think that this is a good sign.
[02:46:34.085 --> 02:46:36.446]  And again, this is going to be one of the problems with Trump.
[02:46:37.256 --> 02:46:50.221]  Now there have been a lot of good noises about him filling his cabinet and the other positions with people outside of the establishment system and obviously that's as you would expect given that he's run his entire campaign on that.
[02:46:50.221 --> 02:46:56.344]  You know, getting people like Kellyanne Conway in there and others, people who've helped him out throughout the campaign.
[02:46:56.344 --> 02:46:58.024]  But I mean, there are so many positions to fill.
[02:46:58.024 --> 02:46:59.885]  What is it, 4,500 positions for starters alone?
[02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:08.342]  Now obviously he's going to get some people in there who might not have his best interests at heart.
[02:47:08.342 --> 02:47:10.102]  So that's what we've got to look out for.
[02:47:10.102 --> 02:47:13.083]  That's what we've got to call him out on.
[02:47:13.083 --> 02:47:23.186]  Because even though the media said, oh, Trump's just a demagogue, well, we're not going to act like those people in North Korea fake crying when Kim Jong Il died.
[02:47:23.186 --> 02:47:23.226]  OK?
[02:47:25.287 --> 02:47:30.370]  If Trump makes mistakes or he doesn't do what he said he's going to do, we're going to hold his feet to the fire.
[02:47:30.370 --> 02:47:33.613]  And that goes for who he appoints in his cabinet.
[02:47:33.613 --> 02:47:41.038]  And in this interview, Ron Paul went on to say, we look at the president, we look at what he said, we look at what he might do when you look at his advisors.
[02:47:41.038 --> 02:47:47.442]  But quite frankly, there's an outside source which we refer to as the deep state or the shadow government.
[02:47:47.442 --> 02:47:52.926]  There's a lot of influence by people which are actually more powerful than our government itself, our president.
[02:47:54.141 --> 02:48:04.569]  He went on to touch on foreign policy and he said basically, quote, During the campaign, he did talk a little bit about backing off and being less confrontational with Russia.
[02:48:04.569 --> 02:48:06.171]  And I like that.
[02:48:06.171 --> 02:48:08.453]  Yeah, that's pretty good that we're not going to have World War III, right?
[02:48:08.453 --> 02:48:10.714]  Like we would have done with Hillary.
[02:48:10.714 --> 02:48:13.256]  He criticised some of the wars in the Middle East at the same time.
[02:48:13.256 --> 02:48:18.621]  He believes we should accelerate the war against ISIS and terrorism without showing he has an understanding of what causes terrorism.
[02:48:18.621 --> 02:48:19.602]  Well, the problem with that is
[02:48:20.677 --> 02:48:29.984]  While claiming that they were at war with ISIS, Hillary Clinton's State Department was literally hiring guards for Benghazi who were Al-Qaeda members.
[02:48:30.925 --> 02:48:37.948]  Right before ISIS came to prominence, they then armed ISIS and then refused to bomb them.
[02:48:37.948 --> 02:48:49.692]  I mean, you saw them dropping the leaflets claiming that it was environmental concerns with a reason why they were giving ISIS members warnings to get out of the area before they bombed the oil tankers.
[02:48:49.692 --> 02:48:52.413]  So, Obama hasn't even been bombing ISIS.
[02:48:52.413 --> 02:48:56.715]  I mean, the Russians came in and basically wiped them out back last year.
[02:48:57.810 --> 02:48:58.971]  But again, this is interesting.
[02:48:58.971 --> 02:49:00.292]  This is what Ron Paul said today.
[02:49:00.292 --> 02:49:06.756]  So Ron Paul's raising the potential of false flags that could get us, get America at least, into another haphazard foreign military adventure.
[02:49:06.756 --> 02:49:08.377]  So we've got to watch out for that.
[02:49:08.377 --> 02:49:12.240]  We've got to watch out for who Donald Trump hires for his cabinet.
[02:49:27.878 --> 02:49:30.520]  We got this story out louder with Crowder.
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:32.041]  Tolerant.
[02:49:32.041 --> 02:49:37.405]  Grubhub CEO tells Trump-supporting employees they're hateful racists.
[02:49:37.405 --> 02:49:57.499]  And this was the CEO, Matt Maloney, of this company called Grubhub, who said, if you do not agree with this statement, which was basically a SJW screed about everyone's a racist if you don't agree with me, if you don't agree with this statement then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here.
[02:49:59.031 --> 02:50:00.291]  More liberal tolerance.
[02:50:00.291 --> 02:50:10.813]  So anybody basically who voted for Donald Trump, anyone who agrees with anything that Donald Trump stands for, he basically told them to resign from his company.
[02:50:10.813 --> 02:50:15.134]  Because he's a tolerant liberal and he can tolerate diversity of opinion.
[02:50:15.134 --> 02:50:16.074]  Oh no, he actually can't.
[02:50:16.074 --> 02:50:17.394]  He just told everyone to resign.
[02:50:17.394 --> 02:50:19.215]  Who disagrees with him?
[02:50:19.215 --> 02:50:20.375]  And what was the response?
[02:50:20.375 --> 02:50:26.296]  Well, there was a complete backlash, calls to boycott Grubhub, which everybody should do,
[02:50:27.369 --> 02:50:29.251]  Boycott Grubhub.
[02:50:29.251 --> 02:50:29.872]  And what happened?
[02:50:29.872 --> 02:50:32.094]  Their stock tanked down 4-5%.
[02:50:32.094 --> 02:50:38.000]  Because lo and behold, intolerant, hateful bigots aren't that popular anymore.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.625]  And you can hide behind your misogyny claims and your racist claims and your...
[02:50:43.903 --> 02:50:44.624]  Fake.
[02:50:44.624 --> 02:50:45.285]  Phony.
[02:50:45.285 --> 02:50:45.926]  Tolerance.
[02:50:45.926 --> 02:50:47.028]  It doesn't work anymore.
[02:50:47.028 --> 02:50:48.570]  People see right through you.
[02:50:48.570 --> 02:50:49.431]  Boycott.
[02:50:49.431 --> 02:50:50.372]  Grubhub.
[02:50:50.372 --> 02:50:52.395]  Another company that's going down.
[02:50:52.395 --> 02:50:56.841]  We will be back with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com.
[02:50:56.841 --> 02:50:57.362]  Don't go away.
[02:51:00.686 --> 02:51:04.787]  Are you feeling embarrassed or stuck because you can't focus or concentrate?
[02:51:04.787 --> 02:51:06.248]  I have a confession to make.
[02:51:06.248 --> 02:51:10.169]  I spent years unable to think clearly, like I was in a fog.
[02:51:10.169 --> 02:51:14.990]  I was going through the motions, running my companies, and I hated feeling mentally sluggish.
[02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:16.331]  I couldn't get ahead like this.
[02:51:17.091 --> 02:51:20.592]  It's no secret, the powers that be want us dumbed down.
[02:51:20.592 --> 02:51:26.654]  Chemicals, fluoride, our brains are under siege, and we are experiencing lower IQs.
[02:51:26.654 --> 02:51:29.795]  But now there is a weapon to fight back, and win.
[02:51:29.795 --> 02:51:32.836]  Introducing DNA Evolve.
[02:51:32.836 --> 02:51:37.218]  A revolutionary breakthrough in a category of cognitive enhancers called nootropics.
[02:51:38.178 --> 02:51:41.881]  I've been using DNA Evolve and couldn't feel better.
[02:51:41.881 --> 02:51:43.822]  For me, it works.
[02:51:43.822 --> 02:51:47.465]  It feels great to get things done again and get ahead.

[02:55:37.623 --> 02:55:41.726]  Final couple of news stories here in the last three minutes.
[02:55:41.726 --> 02:55:45.109]  BBC interview with French far-right leader Marine Le Pen's box.
[02:55:45.109 --> 02:55:46.951]  Twitter storm!
[02:55:46.951 --> 02:55:47.171]  Yes.
[02:55:48.342 --> 02:55:50.844]  This is what they found to be outraged about today.
[02:55:50.844 --> 02:55:57.849]  The fact that the BBC merely asked Marine Le Pen, who could be the next President of France, for an interview.
[02:55:57.849 --> 02:55:59.770]  How disgraceful is that?
[02:55:59.770 --> 02:56:17.023]  Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Front, is to basically far-right means anybody who's speaking any kind of sense right now, is set to appear on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show according to an announcement by the programme's editor and social media users are not happy about it.
[02:56:17.023 --> 02:56:17.083]  Oh!
[02:56:18.615 --> 02:56:25.977]  How offensive that a prominent politician in France who could be the next president would appear on television.
[02:56:25.977 --> 02:56:27.777]  I mean, that's literally Hitler, right?
[02:56:27.777 --> 02:56:28.337]  OMG.
[02:56:28.337 --> 02:56:38.400]  I can't even... Already facing criticism for airing the interview on Remembrance Sunday, editor of the show Rob Burley along with presenter Ma defended the move.
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:38.920]  One Twitter
[02:56:39.881 --> 02:56:46.747]  User 1 Moron responded by saying, WTF is the BBC playing at giving Le Pen airtime?
[02:56:46.747 --> 02:56:47.868]  Yeah, God forbid.
[02:56:47.868 --> 02:56:52.392]  Anybody who disagreed with you politically would be able to have the chance to speak.
[02:56:52.392 --> 02:56:53.453]  We can't have that, can we?
[02:56:53.453 --> 02:56:55.374]  Because we're liberal.
[02:56:55.374 --> 02:56:57.556]  She is a fascist.
[02:56:57.556 --> 02:57:00.679]  Fascists use every platform they have to undermine democracy.
[02:57:00.679 --> 02:57:01.719]  I am done.
[02:57:01.719 --> 02:57:06.143]  Oh no, actually, real fascists stop other people from talking.
[02:57:06.143 --> 02:57:07.044]  Okay?
[02:57:07.044 --> 02:57:07.985]  You're the fascist.
[02:57:09.079 --> 02:57:11.783]  Next headline out of Breitbart.
[02:57:11.783 --> 02:57:14.187]  More cultural enrichment in Germany.
[02:57:14.187 --> 02:57:16.671]  Police warn of child rape epidemic.
[02:57:16.671 --> 02:57:18.434]  That's liberal now, that's tolerant.
[02:57:18.434 --> 02:57:19.736]  Migrant-occupied Malmo.
[02:57:21.420 --> 02:57:22.321]  Actually in Sweden.
[02:57:22.321 --> 02:57:23.522]  Malmo is just a hellhole.
[02:57:23.522 --> 02:57:25.725]  I know people who go there routinely.
[02:57:25.725 --> 02:57:33.053]  They say there's literally homemade bombs going off, burkas everywhere, massive rape gangs just roaming.
[02:57:33.053 --> 02:57:35.155]  This is the cultural enrichment.
[02:57:35.155 --> 02:57:39.801]  And now in Sweden they want to give returning ISIS jihadists jobs.
[02:57:39.801 --> 02:57:42.564]  And some of those jobs are actually in the government.
[02:57:44.178 --> 02:57:51.782]  You've got, like, the head of the immigration board in Sweden tweeting out, posting on Facebook, pro-ISIS propaganda.
[02:57:51.782 --> 02:57:53.763]  That's the level it's got to in Sweden.
[02:57:53.763 --> 02:58:05.029]  But following separate incidents in which children were raped in broad daylight, cultural enrichment, in the multicultural city of Malmo, police warned that the number of sex attacks on young people could escalate.
[02:58:05.029 --> 02:58:11.273]  So they're finally having to admit that these rapes, these mass molestations, are actually taking place.
[02:58:12.688 --> 02:58:29.273]  Thank God we've got an election next year in Germany, and the sensible, far-right AFD party has a chance of making significant gains, as does Marine Le Pen in the French election next year, as the populist revolution continues to sweep the West.
[02:58:29.273 --> 02:58:37.596]  But that's going to wrap it up for this hour of the Alex Jones Show, but stay tuned, fourth hour coming up with Owen Troyer, breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:42.791 --> 02:58:46.760]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:50.037 --> 02:58:51.758]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[02:58:51.758 --> 02:58:56.061]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown?
[02:58:56.061 --> 02:58:59.623]  Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[02:58:59.623 --> 02:59:01.665]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[02:59:01.665 --> 02:59:04.567]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[02:59:04.567 --> 02:59:10.090]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALEX.
[02:59:10.090 --> 02:59:11.471]  It's a company I trust.
[02:59:11.471 --> 02:59:17.255]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown.
[02:59:17.555 --> 02:59:20.776]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[02:59:20.776 --> 02:59:25.218]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[02:59:25.218 --> 02:59:31.040]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:31.720]  Don't delay.
[02:59:31.720 --> 02:59:38.742]  Call 844-541-ALEX now and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely store your coins absolutely free.
[02:59:38.742 --> 02:59:43.224]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[02:59:43.544 --> 02:59:46.167]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[02:59:46.167 --> 02:59:52.092]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX-NOW.
[02:59:52.092 --> 03:00:01.101]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.101 --> 03:00:06.746]  Behind me stands the University of Texas Tower where a large protest is going on, the F-Trump protest.
[03:00:07.580 --> 03:00:12.546]  We're not even 24 hours into his president-elect candidacy, and this is their reaction.
[03:00:12.546 --> 03:00:16.170]  They attack Trump as a racist, a misogynist, a rapist.
[03:00:16.170 --> 03:00:18.473]  But do they actually know the facts?
[03:00:18.473 --> 03:00:21.036]  What's your opinion of Trump being elected president?
[03:00:21.036 --> 03:00:23.499]  I'm really sad and disappointed.
[03:00:23.499 --> 03:00:24.080]  Why is that?
[03:00:25.017 --> 03:00:30.040]  Because I think he's a terrible person who doesn't deserve to be the face of the United States.
[03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:31.661]  Why is he a terrible person?
[03:00:31.661 --> 03:00:37.405]  Well, he's been accused of sexually assaulting several women.
[03:00:37.405 --> 03:00:42.588]  He's also racist and quite clearly sexist, possibly homophobic.
[03:00:42.588 --> 03:00:43.749]  Okay, all right.
[03:00:43.749 --> 03:00:50.694]  Hillary was also under NYPD investigation, according to Eric Prince of Blackwater.
[03:00:51.554 --> 03:00:56.738]  And she was found to have visited Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile island six times.
[03:00:56.738 --> 03:00:58.599]  So she is under investigation.
[03:00:58.599 --> 03:01:05.323]  I don't think several women have specifically come out and said, this person sexually assaulted me.
[03:01:05.323 --> 03:01:06.244]  About Hillary Clinton?
[03:01:06.844 --> 03:01:07.684]  Right.
[03:01:07.684 --> 03:01:08.485]  Yeah, they have it.
[03:01:08.485 --> 03:01:09.785]  It's under investigation.
[03:01:09.785 --> 03:01:10.185]  Right.
[03:01:10.185 --> 03:01:11.166]  As is Donald Trump.
[03:01:11.166 --> 03:01:13.266]  Okay, what about the racism?
[03:01:13.266 --> 03:01:14.327]  What about the racism?
[03:01:14.327 --> 03:01:15.987]  How do you explain the racism?
[03:01:15.987 --> 03:01:17.208]  He was endorsed by the KKK.
[03:01:17.208 --> 03:01:19.968]  Okay, he was endorsed by the KKK.
[03:01:19.968 --> 03:01:21.489]  He was like, this is my guy.
[03:01:21.489 --> 03:01:25.930]  Do you realize Hillary Clinton's mentor was Robert Byrd?
[03:01:25.930 --> 03:01:26.751]  Is that just a joke?
[03:01:28.314 --> 03:01:29.916]  Is that just a joke to you?
[03:01:29.916 --> 03:01:30.717]  Is what a joke?
[03:01:30.717 --> 03:01:36.623]  Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd.
[03:01:36.623 --> 03:01:41.488]  Senator Byrd was a man of surpassing eloquence and nobility.
[03:01:41.488 --> 03:01:47.074]  There are a lot of people who wrote these eulogies for Senator Byrd in the newspapers and I read a bunch of them.
[03:01:48.727 --> 03:01:53.349]  They mentioned that he once had a fleeting association with a Ku Klux Klan.
[03:01:53.349 --> 03:01:54.309]  And what does that mean?
[03:01:54.309 --> 03:01:55.849]  I'll tell you what it means.
[03:01:55.849 --> 03:01:58.570]  He was a country boy from the hills and hollows of West Virginia.
[03:01:58.570 --> 03:02:01.151]  He was trying to get elected.
[03:02:01.151 --> 03:02:04.052]  And maybe he did something he shouldn't have done.
[03:02:04.052 --> 03:02:06.153]  And he spent the rest of his life making it up.
[03:02:06.798 --> 03:02:09.220]  I don't understand why you ask if that's a joke.
[03:02:09.220 --> 03:02:14.525]  Well, if Trump is a racist, why isn't Hillary Clinton a racist?
[03:02:14.525 --> 03:02:16.988]  Is KKK endorsing Hillary?
[03:02:16.988 --> 03:02:19.430]  The Klan was her mentor.
[03:02:19.430 --> 03:02:20.591]  Why is it so funny?
[03:02:20.591 --> 03:02:22.333]  Alright, so why did you come up here to the protest?
[03:02:23.414 --> 03:02:33.385]  I was walking to class and I saw it was when it was smaller here and then when I came back... See, that brings everyone together.
[03:02:33.385 --> 03:02:41.214]  Obviously, it's a very, very big pro-Hillary, anti-Trump rally.
[03:02:41.694 --> 03:02:43.575]  Earlier, you mentioned the people with masks.
[03:02:43.575 --> 03:02:45.416]  Do you know who those people are?
[03:02:45.416 --> 03:02:49.598]  From what I can tell, they're wearing keffiyehs, which generally come from the Middle East.
[03:02:49.598 --> 03:02:56.681]  There are a lot of Palestinian supporters wear them, because that's like one of their... What if I told you it's the local Communist Party?
[03:02:56.681 --> 03:02:57.301]  Oh, I knew it.
[03:02:57.301 --> 03:02:58.402]  I knew it was.
[03:02:58.402 --> 03:03:03.404]  Because, I mean, the pro-Palestinian group here on campus is very, very communist.
[03:03:03.404 --> 03:03:06.305]  I know a few people from classes that are involved.
[03:03:06.305 --> 03:03:08.186]  I think we can come together now.
[03:03:08.186 --> 03:03:09.707]  Donald Trump said, make America great again.
[03:03:10.267 --> 03:03:11.668]  I think we can do that.
[03:03:11.668 --> 03:03:16.369]  And this is going to involve everyone across the entire political spectrum.
[03:03:16.369 --> 03:03:19.610]  Left, right, communist, conservative.
[03:03:19.610 --> 03:03:25.993]  Everyone is going to have to work together to make this country great again.
[03:03:25.993 --> 03:03:30.514]  In fact, the majority of them actually believe they're going to be immediately deported.
[03:03:33.661 --> 03:03:35.042]  Uh huh.
[03:03:35.042 --> 03:03:37.825]  Why does Trump have to go?
[03:03:37.825 --> 03:03:40.768]  Because he does not represent this country.
[03:03:40.768 --> 03:03:46.713]  He is racist, xenophobic, and completely utter... Where are you from, my friend?
[03:03:46.713 --> 03:03:48.435]  I am from Houston.
[03:03:48.435 --> 03:03:49.596]  Okay, where are you?
[03:03:49.596 --> 03:03:50.957]  I was born and raised here.
[03:03:50.957 --> 03:03:52.099]  I am a Muslim American.
[03:03:52.099 --> 03:03:52.659]  You're an American?
[03:03:52.659 --> 03:03:53.119]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:53.119 --> 03:03:54.541]  I am a Muslim American.
[03:03:54.541 --> 03:03:57.223]  I do not deserve to be thrown out of this country.
[03:03:57.223 --> 03:03:58.605]  Well, of course you don't.
[03:03:59.245 --> 03:03:59.705]  Exactly.
[03:03:59.705 --> 03:04:01.026]  Of course not.
[03:04:01.026 --> 03:04:02.347]  Freedom of religion.
[03:04:02.347 --> 03:04:02.707]  Yes sir.
[03:04:02.707 --> 03:04:05.008]  I do not believe Trump respects that.
[03:04:05.008 --> 03:04:12.252]  He believes all of my kind are terrorists, are radical Islamists, when very few of us are.
[03:04:12.252 --> 03:04:14.854]  What's the first thing that comes to mind?
[03:04:15.354 --> 03:04:27.918]  He's gonna deport illegal immigrants who will help this country and white supremacy.
[03:04:27.918 --> 03:04:35.861]  The local Communist Party that I spoke to here in Austin wouldn't speak back because they don't believe in free speech and frankly they're cowards.
[03:04:35.861 --> 03:04:38.762]  This entire march was a march of cowardice.
[03:04:38.762 --> 03:04:44.404]  As Obama, your leader, has explained to you, you must accept this peaceful transfer of power
[03:04:45.024 --> 03:04:46.986]  And accept the resurrection of the U.S.
[03:04:46.986 --> 03:04:51.390]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights of which this country was founded on.
[03:04:51.390 --> 03:04:52.592]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[03:05:00.839 --> 03:05:05.986]  Three days after the election of Donald Trump and the reality of a Trump presidency is starting to hit home.
[03:05:05.986 --> 03:05:11.373]  For some people this is such a devastating notion that they need to call an ambulance or even want to die.
[03:05:11.373 --> 03:05:15.278]  Well we Trump voters care about our fellow Americans and we're pained by this.
[03:05:15.278 --> 03:05:15.759]  So let's help
[03:05:16.359 --> 03:05:19.781]  Let's try to help them recover from their devastation.
[03:05:19.781 --> 03:05:25.003]  If you see a Trump protester or a group of them, give them a diaper, hand them a binky, cover them in a blankie.
[03:05:25.003 --> 03:05:27.445]  After all, this is what you do for crying babies.
[03:05:27.445 --> 03:05:31.186]  Many of these people look like they need a hug, so give them a box of huggies.
[03:05:31.186 --> 03:05:38.810]  We Trump voters can't stand to see our fellow Americans so depleted, so we will make sure to get as many of them a warm bottle of milk as possible.
[03:05:38.810 --> 03:05:44.993]  To make America great again, we must make sure that these babies are taken care of with plenty of diapers, binkies, and rattles.
[03:05:45.313 --> 03:05:46.876]  Don't worry, Trump protesters.
[03:05:46.876 --> 03:05:50.483]  Remember, we're stronger together, even if you do have to wear a diaper.
[03:05:50.483 --> 03:05:53.769]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[03:05:53.769 --> 03:05:55.232]  This message is paid for by the Russians.
[03:05:59.867 --> 03:06:09.214]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid.
[03:06:09.214 --> 03:06:20.282]  The potential for power grid chaos, EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[03:06:20.282 --> 03:06:23.224]  My friends, chaos is already here, and it's gonna get a lot worse.
[03:06:23.464 --> 03:06:29.528]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.

[03:08:01.178 --> 03:08:18.752]  I'm about to give you the secret, the jewel in the crown, to why Donald Trump decisively won this historic 2016 presidential election, and is now president-elect number 45.
[03:08:18.752 --> 03:08:21.494]  Man, that's got a good ring, doesn't it?
[03:08:21.494 --> 03:08:22.374]  Are you ready?
[03:08:22.374 --> 03:08:25.417]  I'll give you the jewel in the crown, and then the
[03:08:27.093 --> 03:08:31.798]  The accompanying accoutrement on the sides, the smaller jewels.
[03:08:31.798 --> 03:08:33.039]  Are you ready?
[03:08:33.039 --> 03:08:44.911]  Because this secret deployed against the rest of this corrupt power structure will bring them down and restore our republic.
[03:08:44.911 --> 03:08:45.432]  The Internet.
[03:08:47.366 --> 03:09:03.833]  This is what killed the New World Order globalist establishment and is why their program of tyranny is declining in Russia, Europe, the United Kingdom with Brexit and now with shocking results supposedly to them here in the United States.
[03:09:03.833 --> 03:09:14.037]  The Internet coupled with delusion, this marriage, this Congress is what brought us to this point.
[03:09:14.037 --> 03:09:14.497]  Think about it.
[03:09:15.799 --> 03:09:24.693]  The internet already is hundreds and hundreds of times bigger than all the entertainment news combined on broadcast and cable transmitted and satellite TVs.
[03:09:24.693 --> 03:09:27.477]  I mean there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times the traffic.
[03:09:27.477 --> 03:09:30.702]  And the political traffic on the internet is...
[03:09:32.252 --> 03:09:32.892]  50, 100 times?
[03:09:32.892 --> 03:09:33.373]  I don't know.
[03:09:33.373 --> 03:09:38.434]  It's just so huge, they just corrected me that it wasn't 60 million earlier.
[03:09:38.434 --> 03:09:39.315]  They went and did the numbers.
[03:09:39.315 --> 03:09:41.736]  I guess I hadn't checked since this morning.
[03:09:41.736 --> 03:09:51.199]  100 million, not counting terrestrial radio, that we have 3.5 million rated, when the ratings come in, from our affiliates.
[03:09:53.595 --> 03:10:00.979]  But our internet success is so big that we just got like 60 more affiliates last few months, so we're over 230 right now.
[03:10:00.979 --> 03:10:03.280]  And it's not about Infowars bragging.
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:20.309]  If this ragtag operation is kicking the entire cable news system's ass up and down the road, when they're spending billions of dollars in the aggregate and have all these beauty queen tarts up there spreading their legs, you can't cover up this fraud with a little bit of sugar.
[03:10:20.309 --> 03:10:22.791]  So having bimbos on there, it'd mean we're swallowing the cyanide.
[03:10:23.712 --> 03:10:39.157]  And when I talk about the hubris, the delusion of the delusionites, they've known for years that not just InfoWars, but a constellation of Liberty sites like DrudgeReport.com and others dwarfed them already.
[03:10:39.157 --> 03:10:42.158]  And it isn't just InfoWars that exploded the last few months.
[03:10:42.158 --> 03:10:50.541]  Drudge is now not just bigger than Facebook and Twitter and the New York Times combined, it's bigger than like
[03:10:51.567 --> 03:10:54.009]  The entire mainstream media just in traffic.
[03:10:54.009 --> 03:10:56.011]  There's two people running it.
[03:10:56.011 --> 03:10:57.252]  So think about that.
[03:10:57.252 --> 03:10:59.434]  This is how pathetic these people are.
[03:10:59.434 --> 03:11:04.478]  And we have to celebrate the fact that they're pathetic, and they're known traitors, and they're jokes, because they're all scared up.
[03:11:04.478 --> 03:11:09.762]  They're going, the pollsters actually weren't wrong, and we don't lie to you, and we have a big audience, and we love you.
[03:11:09.762 --> 03:11:11.504]  Here, here's one with big breasts.
[03:11:11.504 --> 03:11:12.305]  Show your legs, baby.
[03:11:14.158 --> 03:11:15.558]  Paul Ryan likes you.
[03:11:15.558 --> 03:11:17.939]  He doesn't want your guns or open borders.
[03:11:17.939 --> 03:11:20.599]  He didn't say you couldn't nominate Trump.
[03:11:20.599 --> 03:11:23.200]  He didn't say that there wasn't any free elections.
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:26.501]  They're hoping you go back to sleep, but you're not asleep.
[03:11:26.501 --> 03:11:37.183]  So the big secret is, they're still up there wondering why they have no ratings, wonder why they're going bankrupt, wonder why they're all shrinking, wonder why the New York Times is collapsing, and they still don't get it.
[03:11:38.732 --> 03:11:52.797]  They have no audience and just because they have the fanciest suits and the biggest teleprompters doesn't mean anybody takes what they say seriously and no one's even tuning into them to go back and regurgitate their talking points out.
[03:11:52.797 --> 03:11:57.138]  I go to forums that don't even deal with politics and everybody gets exactly what's happening.
[03:11:57.138 --> 03:11:58.678]  I walk down the street, people get it.
[03:11:58.678 --> 03:12:06.421]  Now sure, about a third of the public can't tie their shoelaces and they're long gone, you know, George Soros control, but a large group of people, a majority now,
[03:12:07.549 --> 03:12:09.729]  Are awake, and here's what's scary to the establishment.
[03:12:09.729 --> 03:12:11.610]  They're getting awake a lot faster.
[03:12:11.610 --> 03:12:21.612]  So barring launching a big war, barring a total stock market collapse, which we're already headed towards, barring societal breakdown, they're not going to be able to organize and keep themselves in power.
[03:12:21.612 --> 03:12:25.692]  And even a societal breakdown will only blow up in their face.
[03:12:25.692 --> 03:12:29.113]  There's nothing they can do.
[03:12:29.113 --> 03:12:31.153]  Elites always believe they're invincible.
[03:12:31.153 --> 03:12:32.874]  They always believe they're unstoppable.
[03:12:32.874 --> 03:12:33.834]  So you have the big jewel.
[03:12:34.605 --> 03:12:49.810]  The internet and their own delusion, instead of admitting they've lied in the last decade as their credibility collapsed, they began to double and triple down, making fun of us, laughing at us, saying we're pathetic, saying we wear tinfoil hats.
[03:12:49.810 --> 03:12:59.553]  That's all they've got is this Carnival Barker scam to act like we're the ones with no credibility and he's that Alex Jones, that nut on the internet.
[03:13:00.692 --> 03:13:09.238]  I am so proud we're self-made in a market of ideas coming from local radio and AXS TV 21 years ago.
[03:13:09.238 --> 03:13:12.881]  I like my grassroots bonafides.
[03:13:12.881 --> 03:13:18.505]  But you're all from trashy families, social climbers, who went and sold yourselves out to the elite.
[03:13:18.505 --> 03:13:28.372]  I go study most of these talk show hosts and most of these movie people and most of these political hosts, and man, they come from families where their dad was a con artist and their mom was involved in weird stuff.
[03:13:29.813 --> 03:13:37.757]  And nothing bad about this, but failures and swindles and scams and they just, the elite went and found a bunch of trash.
[03:13:37.757 --> 03:13:39.298]  Most of the people out here aren't trash.
[03:13:39.298 --> 03:13:42.159]  You come from a family of plumbers that are good, honorable, hardworking folks.
[03:13:42.159 --> 03:13:43.660]  You're good people.
[03:13:43.660 --> 03:13:46.241]  You put them in power, they do a great job.
[03:13:46.241 --> 03:13:49.422]  Ranchers, police officers, whatever the case is.
[03:13:49.422 --> 03:13:56.806]  But you look at the political class, they're all these wannabe nouveau riche trash who are sociopathic, narcissistic, empty.
[03:13:58.055 --> 03:14:18.712]  Totally dishonorable, so they were typecast and picked to be the cacophony of parrots to sit up there repeating the same thing over and over again so we would all feel like we were alone when we thought, well I thought tax cuts helped, or I thought family was okay, or I thought guns were alright for self-defense, or gee they just don't seem to get that good people defend themselves.
[03:14:18.712 --> 03:14:19.773]  Of course they get it!
[03:14:19.773 --> 03:14:24.137]  They're a ruling class of filth trying to capture the greatest nation on earth!
[03:14:26.445 --> 03:14:31.367]  And then I realized good people never brag about their families.
[03:14:31.367 --> 03:14:37.069]  Good people don't ever just think what good folks they come from or what their ancestors did, or they don't even go look into it.
[03:14:37.069 --> 03:14:39.990]  And then I went and looked into my family and all the things they did.
[03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:43.591]  I mean, I'm going to go back to the founding of the country, the Mayflower, Texas Independence.
[03:14:43.591 --> 03:14:46.633]  I mean, at the detonator level of it with Andrew Jackson.
[03:14:46.633 --> 03:14:49.093]  I mean, my family was detonator level.
[03:14:49.093 --> 03:14:52.315]  On my mom's side, complete, absolute detonator.
[03:14:52.315 --> 03:14:53.595]  Original funding, everything.
[03:14:53.595 --> 03:14:54.896]  And you bet it was a covert operation.
[03:14:54.896 --> 03:14:55.436]  You better believe it.
[03:14:57.205 --> 03:15:06.255]  And then he goes right through to my grandfather coming back from World War II and runs as a Republican for desegregation and then works with Eisenhower and his little county and has the Klan come after him.
[03:15:06.255 --> 03:15:11.640]  So I can be called Klan today by a bunch of racist Mexicans with Mexican flags acting like jackasses.
[03:15:12.501 --> 03:15:15.883]  I mean, I just realized, of course I'm fighting tyranny.
[03:15:15.883 --> 03:15:17.584]  Of course I'm not out to screw people.
[03:15:17.584 --> 03:15:18.985]  Of course I'm not trash.
[03:15:18.985 --> 03:15:20.625]  And Trump's the same.
[03:15:20.625 --> 03:15:22.587]  You don't start a fight with Trump, you don't get one.
[03:15:22.587 --> 03:15:23.607]  He's for prosperity.
[03:15:23.607 --> 03:15:26.609]  He does hard-nosed, you know, deals.
[03:15:26.609 --> 03:15:34.333]  But he does want to bring back this republic, and that's why that swamp of trash and filth and scum are coming after him.
[03:15:35.376 --> 03:15:44.119]  And if he thinks Megyn Kelly and Little Twinkle Eyes, Paul Ryan aren't gonna stab him in the back when they're trying to act friendly now, he's crazy.
[03:15:44.119 --> 03:15:49.101]  They're just holding back because at a metaphysical level, they come from filth.
[03:15:49.101 --> 03:15:51.742]  You look them up, they come from trash.
[03:15:51.742 --> 03:15:57.204]  And they inherently have an instinct of trash because they are trash.
[03:15:57.204 --> 03:16:04.367]  And to them, the jewel of America and hijacking it and raping it and destroying it attracts them.
[03:16:06.212 --> 03:16:10.366]  George Soros, the Saudis, the Communist Chinese leaders, these are bad people!
[03:16:11.598 --> 03:16:16.602]  They have to be recognized as who they are, wanting to conquer greater men and women.
[03:16:16.602 --> 03:16:18.763]  So now you've seen the big secret.
[03:16:18.763 --> 03:16:19.404]  You already knew it.
[03:16:19.404 --> 03:16:20.505]  You know I'm telling you the truth.
[03:16:20.505 --> 03:16:21.385]  It's the Internet.
[03:16:21.385 --> 03:16:22.026]  It's bigger.
[03:16:22.026 --> 03:16:22.566]  It's there.
[03:16:22.566 --> 03:16:23.247]  It's the people.
[03:16:23.247 --> 03:16:24.788]  We've broken with mainstream news.
[03:16:24.788 --> 03:16:26.589]  We don't buy a word they say.
[03:16:26.589 --> 03:16:28.331]  They can't ever put it back in the bottle again.
[03:16:28.331 --> 03:16:34.315]  We're going back to basic Americana and what worked in free market, not something like they're saying they don't know where they're going or where they're doing.
[03:16:34.315 --> 03:16:35.016]  Yes, they do.
[03:16:35.016 --> 03:16:36.397]  They've rediscovered liberty.
[03:16:36.397 --> 03:16:37.398]  We've rediscovered it.
[03:16:37.398 --> 03:16:38.218]  We've promoted it.
[03:16:38.218 --> 03:16:39.319]  Ron Paul's promoted it.
[03:16:39.319 --> 03:16:40.280]  Countless others have promoted it.
[03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:49.584]  And so now, we're selling what works, what feels good, what's honorable, what's true, what's historical, what our forebearers did.
[03:16:49.584 --> 03:16:57.347]  And it's spiritually, metaphysically clicking in all of us as the spirit of America comes back from the dead.
[03:16:57.347 --> 03:17:00.068]  That we do the hanging!
[03:17:00.068 --> 03:17:01.429]  We run the show!
[03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:02.570]  We build the ships!
[03:17:02.570 --> 03:17:03.750]  We fought the wars!
[03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:05.751]  We planted the crops!
[03:17:05.751 --> 03:17:07.432]  We took care of the kids!
[03:17:07.432 --> 03:17:08.892]  We went in the mines!
[03:17:08.892 --> 03:17:09.273]  Not you!
[03:17:10.441 --> 03:17:14.045]  You've taken this country and pissed all over it.
[03:17:14.045 --> 03:17:24.877]  And now in your arrogance you still think you can con us, even though we've already beaten you so many times despite the fact you rigged the whole thing and had countless funny money from your foreign fellow reserve.
[03:17:24.877 --> 03:17:28.221]  But in that crown are a few other jewels.
[03:17:28.221 --> 03:17:31.765]  Their arrogance, their delusion, the Internet's the big stone.
[03:17:33.848 --> 03:17:38.971]  There's so many other facets to it, and I think you can all recognize what the other reasons Trump won.
[03:17:38.971 --> 03:17:44.934]  People waking up worldwide, the globalist excesses being so arrogant they appoint presidents in Europe and bankrupt countries.
[03:17:44.934 --> 03:17:45.275]  No, really.
[03:17:45.275 --> 03:17:48.076]  I mean, what are other jewels of the crown that brought Trump in?
[03:17:48.076 --> 03:18:03.005]  His stamina, his courage, his will, the people supporting him, Nigel Farage, whistleblowers, the rise of the new media in this internet system, and the vacuum the media created by standing down and being so evil.
[03:18:05.782 --> 03:18:21.150]  The truth is, history's happening, but we've retaken a beachhead, we're winning the overall war, but now we have to drain the swamp, and we cannot sit here and just roll over and out of these people because they are scum, they are trash, they must be prosecuted, justice must be done.
[03:18:21.150 --> 03:18:25.632]  They wanted to shut down the internet, shut off talk radio, go after peaceful people, persecute the media.
[03:18:26.997 --> 03:18:37.980]  Obama sits there all arrogant like he's this big humanitarian, when the border's wide open and our country's collapsing and the health departments are going under and he's on vacation five months out of the year.
[03:18:37.980 --> 03:18:43.622]  It's time to fully... It's kind of like you eat some poison food and you vomit part of it up.
[03:18:43.622 --> 03:18:46.542]  You feel a little better, but you need to get it all out.
[03:18:46.542 --> 03:18:47.803]  We've got about a third of the vomit out.
[03:18:47.803 --> 03:18:49.083]  A third of the poison.
[03:18:49.083 --> 03:18:50.243]  We know there's more poison.
[03:18:50.243 --> 03:18:51.244]  We've got to get it out.
[03:18:51.244 --> 03:18:54.124]  We've got to drink some fresh water.
[03:18:54.124 --> 03:18:55.965]  But in closing, sitting here thinking,
[03:18:57.139 --> 03:19:11.839]  I mentioned the jewel and the crown and the other stones that accompany it, but I didn't mention the overall plan and this crown of idiocy that was placed upon these traders' heads.
[03:19:11.839 --> 03:19:12.320]  And that's God.
[03:19:14.673 --> 03:19:32.006]  God moving through time, moving through history, sitting back 20 plus years seeing where Infowars came from, frustrated over the years trying to build, trying to fight, trying to develop, and then right as it was needed at the final point going into warp drive and absolutely energizing the planetary resistance.
[03:19:33.047 --> 03:19:50.342]  God is moving in all of us, and it is Jesus Christ that gets the final thanks in all of this, because as it's been said a million times a million, the Lord works in mysterious ways, and the Lord works from the most common and simple of us, to the most supposedly high up.
[03:19:50.342 --> 03:19:56.247]  Because God knows, it's the good men and women of this planet, of every race, color, and creed, that are the resistance.

[03:23:28.692 --> 03:23:33.493]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.

[03:24:16.636 --> 03:24:20.697]  Lots of things are transgressing right now since the election of Donald Trump.
[03:24:20.697 --> 03:24:27.878]  Obviously the big thing that people are talking about are all the protesters, the violence, the hypocrisy, and everything we've seen from them.
[03:24:27.878 --> 03:24:33.159]  We'll talk more about that here in a minute, but I got to remind you about our election super specials.
[03:24:33.159 --> 03:24:37.100]  This sale has been extended at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:24:37.100 --> 03:24:39.380]  This is the Help Defend Liberty sale.

[03:24:57.535 --> 03:25:03.518]  Well, we're gonna see all the excuses from the anti-Trump movement and from the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[03:25:25.356 --> 03:25:36.347]  Now although this hasn't really come out of the Hillary Clinton campaign in this year, there are people protesting for the Electoral College to elect Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:36.347 --> 03:25:40.211]  Millions signed petition urging Electoral College to elect Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:41.152 --> 03:25:46.413]  The strange thing about this is, before I get into this petition, I actually follow a lot of these petitions.
[03:25:46.413 --> 03:25:48.514]  There's some sites that do these petitions.
[03:25:48.514 --> 03:25:50.874]  Change.org is the one that launched this one.
[03:25:50.874 --> 03:25:57.096]  But even the federal government has websites where there's petitions, where you can petition the president.
[03:25:57.096 --> 03:26:00.197]  And for whatever reason, the petitions that
[03:26:01.616 --> 03:26:08.501]  That people like I, people like myself would back, the people at Infowars.com would back, the people like our audience would back.
[03:26:08.501 --> 03:26:12.264]  For whatever reason, we never seem to get these things off the ground.
[03:26:12.264 --> 03:26:18.589]  And most of these petitions, like there was a petition I think to impeach Obama that needed like 200,000 signatures.
[03:26:18.589 --> 03:26:22.572]  We didn't even get that in a month's span.
[03:26:22.572 --> 03:26:26.896]  So I'm just curious how that happens when we are the most engaged people, we are the most active.
[03:26:28.015 --> 03:26:37.822]  And I thought to myself, maybe I need to dedicate myself to coming in here every Monday and telling you what the petitions are that we need to sign.
[03:26:37.822 --> 03:26:39.343]  So here's another one.
[03:26:39.343 --> 03:26:42.525]  Is this the one from Change.org guys?
[03:26:42.525 --> 03:26:45.667]  Yeah, so this is the petition that we're looking at.
[03:26:45.667 --> 03:26:50.070]  Now the story that I have here, this came from Yahoo, one of the biggest anti-Trump
[03:26:51.033 --> 03:27:13.220]  Mainstream media outlets going more than 2.4 million people had signed a petition to the US electoral college Urging its members to ignore their state's votes votes and cast their ballots for the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, so that's nice That's nice these people they want you to they're gonna sign a petition to commit treason against this country
[03:27:14.380 --> 03:27:15.441]  How do you like that, folks?
[03:27:15.441 --> 03:27:17.842]  That's what you get from the Hillary Clinton people.
[03:27:17.842 --> 03:27:26.407]  They just openly want to be treasonous against this country, and then actually put in a treasonous president, but that's a whole other issue that they couldn't understand.
[03:27:26.407 --> 03:27:29.028]  And again, I just ask myself, why don't our petitions get millions?
[03:27:29.028 --> 03:27:32.811]  Why can't the petitions against Obama's war crimes and lies get millions?
[03:27:32.811 --> 03:27:35.012]  They're there almost every day, I see these things.
[03:27:35.012 --> 03:27:38.614]  They get almost hundreds of thousands of signatures, but not 2.4 million.
[03:27:38.614 --> 03:27:41.256]  So that's really strange, especially when we've
[03:27:42.227 --> 03:27:46.188]  We've been talking about this, Alex has talked about this, Paul Joseph Watson talked about this.
[03:27:46.188 --> 03:27:50.629]  It was social media, it was the internet that launched Trump to the platform he's at.
[03:27:50.629 --> 03:27:59.232]  So I'm not sure what the dynamic is there, why this petition gets so many signatures but then conservative petitions against the liberal establishment don't.
[03:27:59.232 --> 03:28:02.953]  But look at this, this is from Elijah Berg who launched the petition.
[03:28:02.953 --> 03:28:06.134]  This guy, I'd like to have a word with him.
[03:28:06.134 --> 03:28:08.975]  Mr. Trump is unfit to serve, but Clinton is.
[03:28:09.875 --> 03:28:10.075]  I think?
[03:28:26.837 --> 03:28:28.078]  But it goes on.
[03:28:28.078 --> 03:28:33.723]  Now, I mentioned that we're not hearing anything much out of this from the Clinton camp, but she has talked about this before.
[03:28:33.723 --> 03:28:44.353]  Hillary Clinton, when she was first lady, called for the college to be disbanded, the electoral college, to be disbanded so that no one would ever have to doubt again whether his or her vote counted.
[03:28:44.353 --> 03:28:48.557]  Oh, right, because Hillary Clinton is the candidate for voter integrity.
[03:28:48.557 --> 03:28:49.518]  I'm sorry, I forgot.
[03:28:49.978 --> 03:28:52.980]  It wasn't that there were dead voters voting in this election.
[03:28:52.980 --> 03:28:54.341]  Oh wait, it was!
[03:28:54.341 --> 03:28:56.983]  It wasn't that there were illegal immigrants voting in this election.
[03:28:56.983 --> 03:28:58.384]  Oh wait, it was!
[03:28:58.384 --> 03:29:05.168]  And it was the Obama administration that greased the skids for this to happen, even promoted it, folks.
[03:29:05.168 --> 03:29:06.409]  I mean, let's be perfectly honest.
[03:29:06.409 --> 03:29:09.411]  The man was promoting illegals to vote.
[03:29:09.411 --> 03:29:15.135]  And of course, the administration was looking to fast-track amnesty to get these people to vote.
[03:29:15.714 --> 03:29:25.869]  And I'll tell you this, these people can sit here and cry over the fact that Hillary Clinton, I guess, allegedly won the popular vote, but I'm not buying it.
[03:29:25.869 --> 03:29:28.893]  I think that they rigged it and that's why she won the popular vote.
[03:29:28.893 --> 03:29:31.797]  But I'll tell you what, people were asking me,
[03:29:32.952 --> 03:29:34.433]  What should we do about the Electoral College?
[03:29:34.433 --> 03:29:34.873]  Do you like it?
[03:29:34.873 --> 03:29:35.473]  Do you not like it?
[03:29:35.473 --> 03:29:39.735]  At first I wasn't sure, but then after this election, I like the Electoral College.
[03:29:39.735 --> 03:29:40.935]  Because, you know what?
[03:29:40.935 --> 03:29:45.837]  I don't want all the dumbasses in California deciding who my president is going to be every four years.
[03:29:45.837 --> 03:29:47.238]  Hell no!
[03:29:47.238 --> 03:29:49.378]  We've got more from Alex Jones coming back on the other side.
[03:29:49.378 --> 03:29:50.599]  We're going to drain that swamp.
[03:29:50.599 --> 03:29:53.120]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.120 --> 03:29:55.801]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.373 --> 03:30:04.595]  The NFL is considering some serious changes as ratings continue to plummet.
[03:30:04.595 --> 03:30:11.317]  Some of the changes include reducing ads and ad time, reducing the time of game, to perhaps even changing the way it's officiated.
[03:30:11.317 --> 03:30:26.043]  These were among the things mentioned by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to increase ratings, but he failed to mention the protest of our country by some of its players, like Colin Paperneck, Erika Reid, Kenny Schills, Jackie Tartt, Elizabeth Harreld, and Luz Irving.
[03:30:26.283 --> 03:30:31.224]  Who have been protesting the country during the National Anthem, which without a doubt is affecting ratings.
[03:30:31.224 --> 03:30:36.926]  Wait, the players in the league are protesting the people in the country who drive the high ratings, and the ratings are dropping?
[03:30:36.926 --> 03:30:37.626]  Shocking!
[03:30:37.626 --> 03:30:40.107]  But the PCNFL can't address this.
[03:30:40.107 --> 03:30:54.531]  Perhaps the silver lining in all of this is that people are less inclined to being obsessed with football all day long, and have been following the presidential election, as well as other local and national issues, that they see they can affect with vigilance and action, not just taking a knee.
[03:30:55.051 --> 03:30:59.953]  This is Owen Troyer from InfoWars.com.

[03:31:59.635 --> 03:32:03.658]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[03:32:03.658 --> 03:32:04.799]  Charlie Daniels.
[03:32:04.799 --> 03:32:06.320]  He's always loved America.
[03:32:06.320 --> 03:32:08.322]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[03:32:08.502 --> 03:32:11.283]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[03:32:11.283 --> 03:32:15.444]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[03:32:15.444 --> 03:32:19.386]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collected.
[03:32:19.386 --> 03:32:21.366]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[03:32:21.366 --> 03:32:22.967]  It's gonna be commanding guns.
[03:32:22.967 --> 03:32:23.307]  Oh, yeah.
[03:32:23.307 --> 03:32:25.288]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[03:32:25.868 --> 03:32:26.830]  At all.
[03:32:26.830 --> 03:32:27.911]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[03:32:27.911 --> 03:32:30.074]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:32:30.074 --> 03:32:31.256]  It's time to ride, boys.
[03:32:31.256 --> 03:32:33.259]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[03:32:33.259 --> 03:32:39.327]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:32:39.327 --> 03:32:41.190]  And beef was for supper.
[03:32:41.890 --> 03:32:44.372]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:32:44.372 --> 03:32:46.233]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:32:46.233 --> 03:32:47.874]  DVDs now available.
[03:32:47.874 --> 03:32:52.256]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:32:52.256 --> 03:32:55.938]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:32:55.938 --> 03:32:58.299]  Revelation, themovie.info.
[03:32:58.299 --> 03:32:59.080]  Let's fix it.
[03:33:10.088 --> 03:33:13.299]  Another time in the Age of Wonder.
[03:33:28.434 --> 03:33:33.077]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:33.077 --> 03:33:39.141]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:43.234 --> 03:33:49.919]  I'm told by MSN that we should just relax now and be happy and enjoy our big victory.
[03:33:49.919 --> 03:33:52.221]  Because, wow, the system's been repudiated.
[03:33:52.221 --> 03:33:56.825]  Donald J. Trump elected 45th President of the United States of America.
[03:33:56.825 --> 03:33:59.727]  Ladies and gentlemen, this has been an amazing victory.
[03:33:59.727 --> 03:34:02.310]  But it's only a beachhead in retaking this country.
[03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:06.613]  To make America great again, we must retake the nation.
[03:34:06.613 --> 03:34:13.459]  We have criminal enterprises, multinational corporations, crony insider combines in this rigged system.
[03:34:13.459 --> 03:34:25.349]  So Donald Trump has gotten control of the swamp, but he's got to put the equipment in the swamp now, and he has to blow the dam and drain the swamp out into the ocean of history.
[03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:29.773]  It is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.
[03:34:30.703 --> 03:34:33.826]  And to do that, he has to remove Paul Ryan.
[03:34:33.826 --> 03:34:38.231]  And he's got the clout to go in and have the Republicans enforce the vote and do it.
[03:34:38.231 --> 03:34:40.193]  Paul Ryan stabbed him in the back over and over again.
[03:34:40.193 --> 03:34:43.517]  Paul Ryan wouldn't give him the money that Trump raised under law.
[03:34:43.517 --> 03:34:45.919]  Paul Ryan told everybody he's going to lose the House.
[03:34:45.919 --> 03:34:46.981]  He's going to lose the Senate.
[03:34:46.981 --> 03:34:49.643]  They picked up seats more than they thought.
[03:34:49.643 --> 03:34:51.445]  They told you he could never get the nomination.
[03:34:51.445 --> 03:34:52.206]  They told you!
[03:34:53.147 --> 03:34:56.449]  Fox News and the Republican sickening establishment.
[03:34:56.449 --> 03:34:59.971]  We've removed Hillary, now it's the Republicans and the Democrats in Congress.
[03:34:59.971 --> 03:35:04.814]  They told us that he can never have the nomination, even if he had three times as many delegates.
[03:35:04.814 --> 03:35:12.699]  It was the party that decided why they were the enlightened, anointed, George Will called it sovereigns of the party.
[03:35:12.699 --> 03:35:16.442]  The royalty, like the hereditary dictators in England from
[03:35:17.543 --> 03:35:23.406]  Transylvania, I'm German, or Kim Jong-un of North Korea, a third-generation hereditary dictator.
[03:35:23.406 --> 03:35:30.791]  But don't tell that to all the dumbass young college kids brainwashed at state schools that communism isn't some type of wonderful heaven.
[03:35:31.738 --> 03:35:36.260]  Now that said, if we want to make America great again, we've got to make it free again.
[03:35:36.260 --> 03:35:41.701]  And to do that, we've got to get the agenda of cutting taxes for people under $40,000 a year to basically zero.
[03:35:41.701 --> 03:35:42.782]  Trump's doing that.
[03:35:42.782 --> 03:35:43.702]  Wonderful.
[03:35:43.702 --> 03:35:47.303]  Cutting the corporate tax so it brings the money back to the US.
[03:35:47.303 --> 03:35:48.564]  We have the highest in the world.
[03:35:48.564 --> 03:35:50.364]  And a lot of those other basic issues.
[03:35:50.364 --> 03:35:54.386]  Not letting people just undocumented flood in with cholera and
[03:35:55.907 --> 03:36:00.629]  Stuff like leprosy that's been gone for over a hundred years in this country at record levels.
[03:36:00.629 --> 03:36:06.853]  The CDC admits health departments are collapsing everywhere.
[03:36:06.853 --> 03:36:08.174]  We have to secure the borders.
[03:36:08.174 --> 03:36:10.015]  We have to secure our currency.
[03:36:10.015 --> 03:36:17.700]  We have to cut taxes and freeze spending so we can start paying down the debt and get us back online to being the world's greatest creditor nation.
[03:36:18.803 --> 03:36:27.395]  And if Trump's going to do that, he can't work with Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and all these other people who are going to stab him in the back in a minute.
[03:36:27.395 --> 03:36:34.706]  If he thinks Paul Ryan and Boehner and all these guys, and Boehner wasn't even one of the worst actually, stabbed him in the back.
[03:36:35.527 --> 03:36:37.948]  Over and over again, he is crazy.
[03:36:37.948 --> 03:36:40.568]  And obviously Donald Trump's really smart.
[03:36:40.568 --> 03:36:42.889]  And Donald Trump is fearless and he's done it his way.
[03:36:42.889 --> 03:36:44.189]  He's discredited the media.
[03:36:44.189 --> 03:36:45.909]  He has discredited the pollsters.
[03:36:45.909 --> 03:36:50.110]  He's discredited the whole lying system because we, the people, were backing it.
[03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:56.752]  And everybody knows that they use the fact that Infowarriors were probably half of Trump's base support.
[03:36:57.552 --> 03:36:58.052]  I don't know.
[03:37:15.086 --> 03:37:15.386]  I don't
[03:37:34.690 --> 03:37:39.113]  And then the media wrote articles saying Alex Jones is insane.
[03:37:39.113 --> 03:37:41.795]  He thinks Donald Trump really likes him.
[03:37:41.795 --> 03:37:49.400]  He thinks because Donald Trump has told him he's instrumental in the awakening of America that it's true.
[03:37:49.400 --> 03:37:55.365]  So again, it's that paradoxical system where they say one thing out of their mouth one day and another thing out of their mouth another day.
[03:37:55.765 --> 03:38:00.846]  The truth is, I know this movement is about Infowars, because it's about you.
[03:38:00.846 --> 03:38:12.770]  And I go out on the streets of America, when in many cases, every other person I walk by is a listener and a viewer, and I know they're black, they're white, they're Hispanic, they're old, they're young, they're from foreign countries.
[03:38:13.010 --> 03:38:23.778]  And I know the demographics, and I know the numbers we have of 60 plus million, 70 million, we're not even sure, people that have tuned in in the last week just to our platforms.
[03:38:23.778 --> 03:38:26.620]  This is world-changing, and the system knows that.
[03:38:26.620 --> 03:38:34.406]  That's why they're trying to foment and fund all this garbage race war, is because that's all an elite can do, is try to divide and conquer us.
[03:38:34.406 --> 03:38:35.586]  Get the f*** out of here, dude!
[03:38:35.586 --> 03:38:37.148]  Dude, this is a public street!
[03:38:37.148 --> 03:38:38.328]  F***ing piece of s*** racist!
[03:38:38.328 --> 03:38:39.469]  How is he racist?
[03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.930]  How?
[03:38:39.930 --> 03:38:40.390]  Yeah!
[03:38:40.390 --> 03:38:41.070]  F***ing Trump!
[03:38:41.070 --> 03:38:41.651]  We were told
[03:38:42.824 --> 03:38:48.015]  That there was no way that he could ever win the nomination.
[03:38:48.015 --> 03:38:52.705]  And then they stole the nomination from Sanders, but Trump fought for it, so they had to back off.
[03:38:53.666 --> 03:38:56.988]  And then, there was clear evidence of election fraud all over the country.
[03:38:56.988 --> 03:39:06.355]  Bev Harris, one of the top election fraud experts in the world, a Democrat, nonpartisan, concurred with my analysis that there was major discrepancies in at least five states, all against Trump.
[03:39:06.355 --> 03:39:09.217]  The flipping of votes all across the country against Trump.
[03:39:09.217 --> 03:39:19.165]  The massive evidence of fraud, but still, there was such a tsunami wave, as Bev Harris and other experts have said, and as Trump has said, you can't cheat a landslide.
[03:39:20.558 --> 03:39:21.679]  The American people came out.
[03:39:21.679 --> 03:39:25.141]  Record numbers of black Americans, Hispanic Americans, voted for Trump.
[03:39:25.141 --> 03:39:34.287]  But the media tries to make it racial and call it a white lash to make anybody who stands up for sovereignty and lower taxes a racist.
[03:39:34.287 --> 03:39:37.149]  But the good news is, prosperity isn't racist.
[03:39:37.149 --> 03:39:41.712]  And folks across the world, not just here in the United States, see through that.
[03:39:41.712 --> 03:39:45.895]  Economists understand that the American engine of liberty
[03:39:46.957 --> 03:39:47.077]  We're
[03:40:08.595 --> 03:40:10.621]  We even had the Revolutionary War.
[03:40:10.621 --> 03:40:16.678]  They were calling the colonies the American system because they weren't following all the regulations and all the rules.
[03:40:18.035 --> 03:40:25.421]  That they had in Europe or they had in England that only allowed certain companies to produce certain things because they had a license from the government.
[03:40:25.421 --> 03:40:27.703]  The government was picking the winners and losers.
[03:40:27.703 --> 03:40:31.846]  And Donald Trump, more than anything, is trying to just bring back basic America.
[03:40:31.846 --> 03:40:34.028]  He's not even that hardcore, folks.
[03:40:34.028 --> 03:40:38.091]  And that's why they're so scared, because they're up there running and selling the whole system.
[03:40:38.852 --> 03:40:45.197]  And if he leaves any of those people in there and their whole networks, it'll be impossible for him to get anything done.
[03:40:45.197 --> 03:40:47.639]  And they're going to just sit there and wait to assassinate him.
[03:40:47.639 --> 03:40:51.002]  They're going to sit there and wait till he's got his back turned.
[03:40:51.002 --> 03:40:55.645]  And they've tricked him enough to put some of their operatives into the White House.
[03:40:55.645 --> 03:40:58.688]  And they're going to move ahead full steam with their program.
[03:41:00.413 --> 03:41:01.754]  Finally, I want to address this.
[03:41:01.754 --> 03:41:05.457]  Today I was on the radio and I said, look, he must go after Hillary Clinton.
[03:41:05.457 --> 03:41:06.779]  She's committed all these crimes.
[03:41:06.779 --> 03:41:07.920]  It's in all the emails.
[03:41:07.920 --> 03:41:15.586]  The intelligence community leaked all this information because the globalists are planning to actually dismantle this country and end prosperity.
[03:41:15.586 --> 03:41:17.007]  It's total criminality.
[03:41:17.007 --> 03:41:18.148]  It must be exposed.
[03:41:18.148 --> 03:41:19.650]  It must be ferreted out.
[03:41:19.650 --> 03:41:22.232]  We must see her staffers indicted.
[03:41:22.232 --> 03:41:22.592]  They're on
[03:41:23.473 --> 03:41:26.855]  The email's committing crimes, cover-ups, you name it, paper play.
[03:41:26.855 --> 03:41:29.216]  We have to see Hillary Clinton indicted.
[03:41:29.216 --> 03:41:31.597]  We have to see Bill Clinton indicted for Haiti.
[03:41:31.597 --> 03:41:33.858]  We have to see Chelsea Clinton get in trouble.
[03:41:33.858 --> 03:41:52.486]  Because they're not above the law, they're not new royalty, and it's been a long, long time since the Nixon era of 1974 that we've seen any justice for these high-level, quote, officials who act like they're imperial gods and think they're invincible because we've been treating them like they're Kim Jong-un of North Korea.
[03:41:53.368 --> 03:42:04.293]  If Hillary wasn't such a demon, and if these globalists weren't so out of control, and we were just kicking some, you know, syndicate out, then I'd say, let them go to abstentia, let them leave.
[03:42:05.370 --> 03:42:06.651]  They're never going to do that.
[03:42:06.651 --> 03:42:09.013]  They're going to keep reorganizing and coming in.
[03:42:09.013 --> 03:42:11.336]  They were planning to shut down the free press this year.
[03:42:11.336 --> 03:42:15.099]  They were saying Alex Jones and Drudge Report don't have a right to exist.
[03:42:15.099 --> 03:42:16.320]  We're going to come after it.
[03:42:16.320 --> 03:42:18.682]  They've already handed the internet over to the UN.
[03:42:18.682 --> 03:42:29.833]  There is so much to reverse that we have to take this momentum and remove the corporate operatives that admit they've infiltrated and basically taken over our country.
[03:42:29.833 --> 03:42:30.693]  So I'll reiterate.
[03:42:31.510 --> 03:42:35.995]  To make America great again, we must take the country back.
[03:42:35.995 --> 03:42:39.538]  Trump has taken the White House, phase one.
[03:42:39.538 --> 03:42:42.381]  It's quite frankly, 70% of the battle.
[03:42:42.381 --> 03:42:46.826]  If he moves decisively now, he has 70% of it.
[03:42:48.220 --> 03:42:52.705]  But every hour ticking, they put their people in over the next two months.
[03:42:52.705 --> 03:42:57.270]  It's time for them to scheme and derail this and kill momentum and come up with new scams.
[03:42:57.270 --> 03:43:02.996]  While they're off balance, he has to come out and say, I'll work with Republicans, but I want the leadership gone.
[03:43:02.996 --> 03:43:07.060]  And I'll work with the Democrats, but Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, you've got to go.
[03:43:07.060 --> 03:43:10.704]  We need new people that want to make this country great again, from your ranks.
[03:43:11.084 --> 03:43:18.807]  But not people that stabbed me in the back, not people that have lied, not people that have said I'm unfit to be president and half the country are deplorables.
[03:43:18.807 --> 03:43:22.508]  We need to see a sign that you witnessed the referendum has happened.
[03:43:22.508 --> 03:43:34.892]  In any other country, in the UK and other areas throughout history, if they had a route like this in a general election, you would see resignations across the government.
[03:43:34.892 --> 03:43:37.813]  People would be stepping down from Parliament itself in the UK.
[03:43:38.897 --> 03:43:41.038]  Instead, they all think they own the country.
[03:43:41.038 --> 03:43:42.979]  They all think they get to stay there.
[03:43:42.979 --> 03:43:44.080]  They all think they're God.
[03:43:44.080 --> 03:43:48.522]  And there's one other big thing Donald Trump's gotta do.
[03:43:48.522 --> 03:43:51.183]  Donald Trump has to dance with those that brung him.
[03:43:51.183 --> 03:43:52.224]  And let me explain something.
[03:43:52.224 --> 03:43:54.064]  I don't want to go to the inauguration.
[03:43:54.064 --> 03:43:55.465]  I'll send crew to cover it.
[03:43:55.465 --> 03:43:57.706]  I never wanted to be on red carpets or Hollywood.
[03:43:57.706 --> 03:43:58.747]  Had that chance.
[03:43:58.747 --> 03:43:59.867]  Had a taste of it.
[03:43:59.867 --> 03:44:00.648]  Don't even care about it.
[03:44:01.835 --> 03:44:06.517]  I'm saying you have to dance with the policies and the Americana ideas that brought you.
[03:44:06.517 --> 03:44:17.701]  We don't need to see Donald Trump all over the mainstream TV like Obama did, fawning with them and going on entertainment shows and try to be America's friend.
[03:44:17.701 --> 03:44:20.982]  We need somebody to be a leader to save this historic republic.
[03:44:20.982 --> 03:44:23.463]  And I know Donald Trump clearly intends to do that.
[03:44:24.768 --> 03:44:30.852]  People are saying to me, oh my gosh, will Donald Trump come back on your show, or does Donald Trump call you, or will you get to go to the White House and eat dinner?
[03:44:30.852 --> 03:44:35.935]  I don't want to go to the White House and eat dinner with a bunch of weirdo ambassadors and strange people.
[03:44:35.935 --> 03:44:41.398]  I want to change the world here with the people and the grassroots, and we've just done it.
[03:44:41.398 --> 03:44:47.662]  I want to take our country back and make not just our nation, but the world great again.
[03:44:47.662 --> 03:44:50.243]  So this isn't about me wanting to
[03:44:52.662 --> 03:44:53.122]  We're good to go.
[03:45:11.650 --> 03:45:13.470]  Infowars is changing the world.
[03:45:13.470 --> 03:45:14.771]  You're changing the world.
[03:45:14.771 --> 03:45:19.451]  And this whole process is about understanding that we're the underdog.
[03:45:19.451 --> 03:45:27.533]  We're coming from behind, like in 1776, against the greatest army the world had ever defeated, the British Empire.
[03:45:27.533 --> 03:45:34.594]  So, you got all these politicos around Trump, and they're going to tell him, go along with the system.
[03:45:34.594 --> 03:45:36.334]  Go with what made you great.
[03:45:36.334 --> 03:45:38.835]  Go with what was a maverick that changed the whole system.
[03:45:40.455 --> 03:45:41.035]  We're good to go.
[03:46:05.561 --> 03:46:09.845]  In the dictionary, next to the word maverick, there should be a picture of Donald Trump.
[03:46:09.845 --> 03:46:14.189]  But all of you that went against the grain, I'm not patting you on the head.
[03:46:14.189 --> 03:46:18.513]  You are just as important as I am or as Matt Drudge is or as Donald Trump.
[03:46:18.513 --> 03:46:23.558]  You're the people that got ridiculed and spit in your face and people attacking you wearing Trump shirts.
[03:46:23.558 --> 03:46:28.163]  You're the people that marched and took action and supported us so we could put airplanes up nationwide.
[03:46:29.286 --> 03:46:31.147]  saying Hillary for prison.
[03:46:31.147 --> 03:46:40.352]  You're the ones that across the border defending the Second Amendment and promoting sovereignty and promoting true basic freedom.
[03:46:40.352 --> 03:46:42.133]  You're the oxygen that runs this whole thing.
[03:46:42.133 --> 03:46:43.454]  You're the wind in the sails.
[03:46:43.454 --> 03:46:46.455]  You are the most important.
[03:46:46.455 --> 03:46:48.576]  You're not behind Infowars.
[03:46:48.576 --> 03:46:50.698]  You're at the heart of Infowars.
[03:46:50.698 --> 03:46:51.938]  You are the resistance.
[03:46:51.938 --> 03:46:52.819]  You are the answer.
[03:46:53.672 --> 03:47:02.095]  And so no matter what happens with Trump, as I said, whether they steal it from him or not, and I thought he was going to win because I had the poll numbers and talked to folks on the ground.
[03:47:02.095 --> 03:47:04.196]  We win because we exposed the globalists.
[03:47:04.196 --> 03:47:05.496]  We promoted populism.
[03:47:05.496 --> 03:47:07.057]  We exposed the insider deals.
[03:47:07.057 --> 03:47:09.758]  If they tried to steal it, it'd blow up with their face even bigger.
[03:47:09.758 --> 03:47:13.739]  Now he wins in an electoral landslide.
[03:47:13.739 --> 03:47:19.021]  And they're up there panicking and squirming and weaseling, saying now they're ready to work with Trump.
[03:47:19.021 --> 03:47:19.962]  Now they're ready to... No.
[03:47:22.352 --> 03:47:26.856]  You cannot trust people with a history of committing crimes against the Republic.
[03:47:26.856 --> 03:47:34.664]  They must be prosecuted because they will never stop their criminal activities until they've been brought to justice and it must be done.
[03:47:36.732 --> 03:47:41.234]  Folks ask, why didn't you go to the Trump rally when he was here in Austin when I was invited?
[03:47:41.234 --> 03:47:52.277]  And I said, I sent my crew, we were there, but I said, when about a third of the people in the audience of 20,000 were wearing our t-shirts, when our reporters got mobbed, we were the rally.
[03:47:52.277 --> 03:47:53.838]  Do you understand that?
[03:47:55.097 --> 03:48:00.221]  We created the movement and the launchpad so there'd be a populist system against the globalists.
[03:48:00.221 --> 03:48:07.067]  I said our best chance would be a libertarian bipartisan Tea Party movement taking over the Republican Party.
[03:48:07.067 --> 03:48:08.128]  We analyzed it.
[03:48:08.128 --> 03:48:09.890]  We looked at it from every angle.
[03:48:09.890 --> 03:48:16.816]  I originally came up with the battle strategy myself and openly pushed it to members of Congress saying look for a candidate.
[03:48:18.846 --> 03:48:33.338]  I had no idea behind the scenes generals and other people had picked up on the plan and my Declaration of Independence Part 2, the drudge poster that went viral, and that that was a small part of the generating the ideas of Donald Trump being drafted.
[03:48:34.929 --> 03:48:50.349]  Trump knows from day one, when people were trying to draft him to run for president, they did it because they knew he was a good person, and because they knew there was a giant liberty movement in the United States growing exponentially, and the military and police were particularly dialed into it.
[03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:58.155]  So I'm giving you some of the back history here as well, just so people understand, we don't need to be told how great we are.
[03:48:58.155 --> 03:48:59.856]  We don't need to be patted on the head.
[03:48:59.856 --> 03:49:05.881]  We don't need to be brought into the inside of the system because the whole scared system is telling Trump, keep us out.
[03:49:05.881 --> 03:49:08.903]  I wouldn't go be part of it inside if they invited me in.
[03:49:10.049 --> 03:49:12.690]  We're building the new system here.
[03:49:12.690 --> 03:49:14.731]  That's what America was all about.
[03:49:14.731 --> 03:49:16.672]  Leave Europe, leave other oppressive areas.
[03:49:16.672 --> 03:49:18.692]  Come here, set up something new.
[03:49:18.692 --> 03:49:22.374]  It won't be perfect, and when it gets corrupt, move further out.
[03:49:22.374 --> 03:49:27.516]  And here we are on the frontier, building the new America, building the new Atlantis in Central Texas.
[03:49:27.516 --> 03:49:31.958]  Not in the old, crumbling, demonic, pedophile-run, demon pit of D.C.
[03:49:31.958 --> 03:49:32.678]  or L.A.
[03:49:32.678 --> 03:49:34.339]  or New York.
[03:49:34.339 --> 03:49:34.739]  We're here.
[03:49:36.061 --> 03:49:36.841]  In the new country.
[03:49:36.841 --> 03:49:38.022]  And it's a spirit.
[03:49:38.022 --> 03:49:39.383]  It's an idea.
[03:49:39.383 --> 03:49:41.204]  And we're animating the contest of liberty.
[03:49:41.204 --> 03:49:43.305]  We're animating the sleeping giant.
[03:49:43.305 --> 03:49:45.586]  Because we are the sleeping giant.
[03:49:45.586 --> 03:49:47.967]  Alex Jones, signing off from fullwars.com.
[03:49:47.967 --> 03:49:50.229]  If you're watching this transmission, I've told you a thousand times.
[03:49:50.229 --> 03:49:51.489]  Now, do you believe me?
[03:49:51.489 --> 03:49:57.893]  You are the resistance!
[03:49:57.893 --> 03:49:58.533]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:49:58.533 --> 03:50:00.854]  And he talks about wanting to build America again.
[03:50:00.854 --> 03:50:02.095]  You know, it's amazing.
[03:50:02.095 --> 03:50:03.976]  What are we seeing right now with these protesters?
[03:50:03.976 --> 03:50:05.277]  They're literally burning flags.
[03:50:06.704 --> 03:50:08.185]  Tearing America down.
[03:50:08.185 --> 03:50:11.088]  Now, the reason I talk about this is because here's an interesting dynamic for me.
[03:50:11.088 --> 03:50:12.510]  First of all, I just got this story.
[03:50:12.510 --> 03:50:15.532]  Muslim student lies about hate crime by man in Trump hat.
[03:50:15.532 --> 03:50:22.139]  So, a Muslim student makes up a story that a Trump supporter ripped her hijab off and shouted racial slurs at her.
[03:50:22.139 --> 03:50:23.460]  She completely fabricated that.
[03:50:23.460 --> 03:50:26.062]  A typical liar right out of the Hillary Clinton camp, I'm sure.
[03:50:26.062 --> 03:50:27.023]  A supporter of her.
[03:50:27.023 --> 03:50:29.486]  That's what happens when you have a liar as a leader.
[03:50:29.486 --> 03:50:30.467]  But here's what's crazy, folks.
[03:50:31.417 --> 03:50:34.900]  Remember, at the beginning of this election cycle, what did the mainstream media say?
[03:50:34.900 --> 03:50:36.261]  Trump supporters were violent.
[03:50:36.261 --> 03:50:37.623]  Trump supporters were bad.
[03:50:37.623 --> 03:50:38.463]  What do we see now?
[03:50:38.463 --> 03:50:39.725]  The exact opposite.
[03:50:39.725 --> 03:50:41.046]  What did they tell you at the end?
[03:50:41.046 --> 03:50:42.507]  Trump will not lose gracefully.
[03:50:42.507 --> 03:50:43.208]  What are we seeing?
[03:50:43.208 --> 03:50:45.550]  The Clinton fans are the ones not losing gracefully.
[03:50:45.550 --> 03:50:48.773]  When will people see that the mainstream media is straight up lying to you?
[03:50:48.773 --> 03:50:49.473]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:49.473 --> 03:50:50.835]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:51:00.327 --> 03:51:02.910]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?

[03:54:52.632 --> 03:54:54.913]  Are the headlines on Drudge right now.
[03:54:54.913 --> 03:54:57.173]  Obama aims to salvage legacy.
[03:54:57.173 --> 03:54:58.694]  Remember, what did Obama say?
[03:54:58.694 --> 03:55:02.135]  The economy is going to be the final legacy.
[03:55:02.135 --> 03:55:03.815]  How the economy is doing will be his legacy.
[03:55:03.815 --> 03:55:07.536]  So they're trying to falsify the numbers with the economy.
[03:55:07.536 --> 03:55:08.677]  That's not going to work.
[03:55:08.677 --> 03:55:09.917]  The globalists are meeting right now.
[03:55:09.917 --> 03:55:10.537]  They're panicking.
[03:55:10.537 --> 03:55:12.838]  They don't know what to do with a Trump administration.
[03:55:12.838 --> 03:55:13.518]  Where's the Pope?
[03:55:13.518 --> 03:55:14.478]  The Pope has been silent.
[03:55:14.478 --> 03:55:15.859]  He told us we couldn't have Trump.
[03:55:15.859 --> 03:55:19.220]  Well, we completely rejected the Pope's narrative and, of course,
[03:55:20.080 --> 03:55:24.745]  Assassinations threats against Donald Trump are hitting Twitter hard right now.
[03:55:24.745 --> 03:55:27.087]  The loving, peaceful left.
[03:55:27.087 --> 03:55:29.549]  Now, of course, what do we expect, folks?
[03:55:29.549 --> 03:55:35.055]  We just had a story about somebody lying about a Trump voter assaulting them.
[03:55:35.055 --> 03:55:37.237]  So, Hillary Clinton's a liar.
[03:55:37.237 --> 03:55:38.378]  Her supporters are gonna lie.
[03:55:38.378 --> 03:55:43.743]  Huma Abedin was pictured crying on the streets.
[03:55:45.569 --> 03:55:52.117]  I'm gonna be honest with you folks, maybe I'm going straight to hell, but I get guilty pleasure out of seeing this.
[03:55:52.117 --> 03:55:52.898]  Yeah.
[03:55:52.898 --> 03:55:54.020]  Cry.
[03:55:54.020 --> 03:55:54.901]  Cry.
[03:55:54.901 --> 03:55:55.702]  Cry.
[03:55:55.702 --> 03:55:56.463]  Cry.
[03:55:56.463 --> 03:55:57.244]  Cry.
[03:55:57.244 --> 03:55:57.965]  Cry.
[03:55:57.965 --> 03:55:58.586]  Cry.
[03:55:58.586 --> 03:56:00.328]  Just like the Hillary Clinton supporters in the...
[03:56:04.801 --> 03:56:11.285]  Okay, Huma Abedin is crying because she could not get her girlfriend Hillary Clinton in office.
[03:56:11.285 --> 03:56:13.066]  I'm sorry to see that.
[03:56:13.066 --> 03:56:17.348]  It's gotta be tough for all the Clinton voters out there, including Cher!
[03:56:17.348 --> 03:56:19.429]  So Cher is now going to leave the planet.
[03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:22.130]  She said she would go to Jupiter if Trump wins.
[03:56:22.130 --> 03:56:26.453]  Now, of course, so basically it was Hillary or death for Cher.
[03:56:26.453 --> 03:56:27.413]  But we'll find out.
[03:56:27.413 --> 03:56:28.934]  Is Cher gonna... You know what?
[03:56:28.934 --> 03:56:29.635]  Here's what we should do.
[03:56:29.635 --> 03:56:30.215]  Elon Musk
[03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:37.254]  Come out with a new rocket, and let's just send Cher to Mars.
[03:56:37.254 --> 03:56:39.336]  I mean, someone's gonna have to be the first trip to Mars.
[03:56:39.336 --> 03:56:40.598]  Let's send Cher!
[03:56:40.598 --> 03:56:43.280]  She's volunteered!
[03:56:43.280 --> 03:56:45.523]  What a- What- You know what, Cher?
[03:56:45.523 --> 03:56:50.188]  You thought that you were gonna make a stand against Trump.
[03:56:50.188 --> 03:56:54.072]  But what you really did was you just volunteered for the first mission to Mars.
[03:56:54.072 --> 03:56:54.852]  Congratulations.
[03:56:55.865 --> 03:56:59.389]  We'll send you to Jupiter if you want, but there's not going to be anywhere for you to land.
[03:56:59.389 --> 03:57:01.071]  That's a ball of gas.
[03:57:01.071 --> 03:57:02.893]  Not sure if you're aware of that.
[03:57:02.893 --> 03:57:04.274]  But then again, what is Cher?
[03:57:04.274 --> 03:57:05.576]  Nothing but a ball of gas.
[03:57:05.576 --> 03:57:07.999]  So, I guess you go where you came from.
[03:57:09.096 --> 03:57:11.638]  Now John Kerry recently visited Antarctica.
[03:57:11.638 --> 03:57:13.340]  Everybody's saying, oh my gosh, the highest U.S.
[03:57:13.340 --> 03:57:15.482]  official to ever visit Antarctica.
[03:57:15.482 --> 03:57:21.907]  So he's going there to try to find out what's going on with climate change, how it is affecting Antarctica.
[03:57:21.907 --> 03:57:24.149]  Well, I'll tell you how, John Kerry.
[03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:30.995]  Now these are stories that are a bit dated as far as today is concerned, but I've actually covered a few of these.
[03:57:30.995 --> 03:57:32.536]  There have been multiple attempts
[03:57:33.740 --> 03:57:44.946]  In a similar fashion, to go down to Antarctica and try to illustrate how the ice caps are melting and global warming is basically causing Antarctica to disappear.
[03:57:44.946 --> 03:57:49.348]  But here's a Daily Caller story from this year in July.
[03:57:49.348 --> 03:57:54.191]  Global warming expedition stopped in its tracks by Arctic sea ice.
[03:57:54.191 --> 03:57:55.812]  There are multiple stories of this.
[03:57:55.812 --> 03:58:00.514]  Actually, if you scroll down here, guys, they actually list how there are multiple examples of this.
[03:58:00.514 --> 03:58:03.016]  Folks, they take these boats, okay?
[03:58:04.065 --> 03:58:20.591]  And what the liberal global warming captains and crew on this ship think they're doing, on these boats think they're doing, is they think that they're going to go prove that everything has melted down there and they can just, you know, float right up to the land.
[03:58:20.591 --> 03:58:21.531]  Guess what happens?
[03:58:21.531 --> 03:58:23.492]  They get trapped in ice!
[03:58:23.492 --> 03:58:26.153]  And then they have to get hauled out because they're stuck in ice.
[03:58:26.153 --> 03:58:26.753]  But you know what?
[03:58:27.759 --> 03:58:28.720]  Screw everything!
[03:58:28.720 --> 03:58:31.481]  I'm just gonna do the mannequin challenge because that's what's cool.
[03:58:31.481 --> 03:58:33.182]  Here's my mannequin challenge going out.
