[01:33.960 --> 01:45.200]  news to cover in this live edition today largest naval deployment since 1991 heads for the Persian
[01:45.200 --> 01:52.360]  Gulf we're breaking that down ceasefire in Georgia dashes neocon predictions of Russian expansion
[01:52.360 --> 01:59.000]  in the region Obama advisor is a big New Brzezinski compares Putin to Hitler that's the London
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.840]  Guardian you may send peacekeepers to enforce ceasefire in South Ossetia whether Russia likes it
[02:05.840 --> 02:16.800]  or not Russia's massive naval force opposite Georgia's third sensitive region a Jaria oil rises
[02:16.800 --> 02:23.240]  for the first time in four days on as dollar weekends as much as I'd love to believe people
[02:23.240 --> 02:26.440]  that are saying with dollars and to come back up I've seen this over and over again the last six
[02:26.440 --> 02:32.680]  seven years the dollar goes down three four cents and then it goes up a penny and then it goes down
[02:32.680 --> 02:36.880]  three or four cents then it goes up a penny or it goes up a penny or two and it goes down five
[02:36.880 --> 02:44.200]  cents but on the long-term graph it's going straight down and they tell you that you know the dollar
[02:44.200 --> 02:49.840]  is is going to come back and they tell you that oil prices are going to go down and I've been
[02:49.840 --> 02:53.440]  predicting all summer that at the end of the summer oil prices would go down but then hit an
[02:53.440 --> 03:01.520]  all-time high yet again next summer that's what it's been doing for the last six plus years every
[03:01.520 --> 03:10.240]  year and the basic market fundamentals show the dollar is going down the crapper as they say I
[03:10.240 --> 03:17.760]  hope that something can change that but the laws of the market say it won't and big investment
[03:17.760 --> 03:24.560]  firms and sovereign wealth firms funds are moving out of the dollar out of the United States so
[03:24.560 --> 03:31.760]  there's the facts there oil rises for the first time in four days as dollar weekends FCC Commissioner

[10:56.480 --> 11:03.800]  of what will also be going over let me go ahead and get into military news in detail
[11:03.800 --> 11:14.880]  first for you largest naval deployment since 1991 heads for the Persian Gulf Kuwait activates
[11:14.880 --> 11:22.800]  emergency war plans as three U.S. warships steam towards Iran with each ship with its
[11:22.800 --> 11:29.600]  auxiliary ships they're going to have now five naval task forces there in the region unbelievable
[11:29.600 --> 11:37.840]  that's the biggest since 1990 build up during desert shield desert storm the latest naval
[11:37.840 --> 11:45.280]  development is the largest since 1991 is unfolding as no less than three U.S. warships make their
[11:45.280 --> 11:50.200]  way towards the Persian Gulf and what observers are calling an unprecedented build up while
[11:50.200 --> 11:56.200]  Kuwait has activated its highest alert in anticipation of a potential attack on Iran
[11:56.200 --> 12:01.360]  now they had to have the police stated measure first here in the United States England Canada
[12:01.360 --> 12:06.080]  and other areas in the global empire in case we don't like it that matter of 80 plus percent
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.320]  of us in every poll don't want a war they say look you don't run the country anymore
[12:10.320 --> 12:14.320]  you just apply the young men for the meat grinder you just pay the bills for the wars
[12:14.320 --> 12:21.560]  shot up slaves just just have it come into realization who we are so we can get our freedom
[12:21.560 --> 12:27.320]  back but this illusion that we've got this freedom all we've got freedom to do is shoot
[12:27.320 --> 12:34.920]  our mouths off against it and they're now trying to shut that down covering that later
[12:34.920 --> 12:40.080]  trying to reports the USS theater Roosevelt the USS Ronald Reagan the USS Iwo Jima are
[12:40.080 --> 12:43.720]  steaming towards the Middle East waters to reinforce the USS Abraham Lincoln and the
[12:43.720 --> 12:49.560]  USS Payloo which are already in the region they will be joined by British Royal Navy
[12:49.560 --> 12:56.680]  carrier battle group and a French nuclear hunter killer submarine group the maneuvers represent
[12:56.680 --> 13:01.720]  the largest movement of warships into the region since the 1991 Gulf War and come just
[13:01.720 --> 13:07.120]  a week after operation brimstone a drill which saw more than a dozen warships from the U.S.
[13:07.120 --> 13:11.440]  British and French naval forces conducting war games the Atlantic Ocean in preparation
[13:11.440 --> 13:16.120]  for a possible confrontation with Iran they said that's what the drill was for the development
[13:16.120 --> 13:20.600]  has fueled rumors that Georgia's sneak attack on Russia in South Ossetia backed by U.S.
[13:20.600 --> 13:25.260]  and Israeli's forces was a shot across the bound a war in Russia against interfering
[13:25.260 --> 13:30.440]  in a strike on Iran which could be imminent Kuwait has activated its highest priority emergency
[13:30.440 --> 13:35.800]  war plan in response to the naval deployment Kuwait was caught by the surprise last time
[13:35.800 --> 13:40.520]  when Iraq troops invaded small emirate and routed the Kuwaiti army in just a few hours
[13:40.520 --> 13:47.560]  a former U.S. diplomat told the Kuwait told the Middle East Times the Israeli news source
[13:47.560 --> 13:53.240]  Debka file speculates that the U.S. naval development could have five alternative implications
[13:53.240 --> 13:59.160]  let me briefly go through those five what they're saying and they love to brag what
[13:59.160 --> 14:04.440]  they're doing so it's pretty accurate from Debka the U.S. aided also by France Britain
[14:04.440 --> 14:10.320]  and Canada's finalizing preparations for a partial naval blockade to deny Iran imports
[14:10.320 --> 14:15.920]  of benzene and other refined oil products this action would indicate that the Bush administration
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.600]  is thrown in the towel on stiff United Nations sanctions and decided to take matters into
[14:20.600 --> 14:27.320]  its own hands Iran which imports 40% of its refined fuel products from Gulf neighbors this
[14:27.320 --> 14:33.160]  is number two will retaliate for the embargo by shutting the Strait of Hormuz oil route
[14:33.160 --> 14:38.160]  choke point in which case the U.S. naval and air forces stand ready to reopen the strait
[14:38.160 --> 14:42.680]  and fight back any Iranian attempt to break through the blockade that means the ships
[14:42.680 --> 14:49.520]  U.S. ships and coalition ships coalition of the wicked will have to move in to that what
[14:49.520 --> 14:58.160]  is it just 30 40 miles across the Iranians have more than 11,000 sunburns which sunburn
[14:58.160 --> 15:03.680]  in placements hundreds of sunburn in placements with over 11,000 in place which they've shown
[15:03.680 --> 15:09.720]  the media the sunburns will fly of course it at treetop level over the water and will
[15:09.720 --> 15:17.360]  blow the living daylights out of all of the ships all of the coalition ships this is unbelievable
[15:17.360 --> 15:23.080]  Washington is developing forces as a backup for possible Israeli military attack on Iran's
[15:23.080 --> 15:27.960]  nuclear installations for a potential rush of events in which U.S. led blockade Israel
[15:27.960 --> 15:33.120]  attack on Iranian reprisals pile up in a very short time and precipitate a major military
[15:33.120 --> 15:40.480]  crisis we just had the biggest military crisis the highest level escalation that we've had
[15:40.480 --> 15:47.040]  since 1961 every top expert's been all over TV you know all over print saying yes what
[15:47.040 --> 15:51.360]  happened with Russia this last week and this week with them moving nukes in and this clash
[15:51.360 --> 15:56.720]  in Georgia and the sneak attack on the Russian forces is the biggest escalation since 61
[15:56.720 --> 16:01.880]  and I believe even bigger than that yes the U.S. snuck attack through its client state
[16:01.880 --> 16:08.840]  Georgia and of course Israel's there commanding the military forces the head of their defense
[16:08.840 --> 16:14.360]  agency is in Israeli their head of the foreign service the foreign minister of Georgia is
[16:14.360 --> 16:18.960]  in Israeli it's unbelievable what Israel the United States and England are doing it is
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.560]  unprecedented all a massive deployment of this nature calls for long planned its occurrence
[16:24.560 --> 16:29.440]  at the time cannot be divorced from the flare up of the Caucasian war between Russia and
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.480]  Georgia while Russia has strengthened its stake in the Caspian oil resources by its
[16:33.480 --> 16:37.400]  overwhelming military intervention against Georgia the Americans are investing might
[16:37.400 --> 16:45.720]  in defending the primary Persian Gulf oil sources of the West and the Far East so that's where
[16:45.720 --> 16:54.400]  we stand on that front meanwhile ceasefire in Georgia dashes neocon predictions of Russian
[16:54.400 --> 17:05.960]  expansion in the region crystal crowd hammer Bolton Cheney they've all been in the New
[17:05.960 --> 17:11.840]  York Times and on the Fox News and everywhere else saying Russia's going to take all of
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.440]  Georgia Russia's going to attack Ukraine we've got to move U.S. military forces in there
[17:16.440 --> 17:25.760]  to engage them engage the Russians Georgia is like Texas and they lost Texas which have
[17:25.760 --> 17:30.040]  been part of their country for hundreds of years in fact it's been in there longer than
[17:30.040 --> 17:34.920]  Texas has been part of the U.S. they lost it in 91 they lost a lot of other satellites
[17:34.920 --> 17:42.480]  that they didn't deserve or didn't belong to them like the Czech Republic Czech proper
[17:42.480 --> 17:50.640]  both parts Ukraine to a certain extent Russian part of the old Russian Empire but you could
[17:50.640 --> 17:56.360]  say it deserved to break away but Georgia and then Georgia snuck attack when the Russians
[17:56.360 --> 18:00.720]  collapsed in 91 heard it slaughtering the ethnic Russians by the tens of thousands so
[18:00.720 --> 18:09.640]  the U.N. moved in and Russians went into the two purely Russian enclaves about Kasia
[18:09.640 --> 18:16.920]  and Ossetia and they were snuck attack after I don't know they've been there since 92
[18:16.920 --> 18:25.200]  how many years is that eight years and eight years 16 years 16 years in Ossetia and surrounding
[18:25.200 --> 18:30.880]  areas and they're snuck attack Thursday night by U.S. back forces with U.S. trainers leading
[18:30.880 --> 18:37.960]  them in Israeli commanders they attack it the Russians have an incredibly moderate response
[18:37.960 --> 18:49.960]  and push the forces out destroy them regrouping and pullback it's it's just amazing and now
[18:49.960 --> 18:56.120]  well let's go ahead and we come back from break I'm gonna play this clip this is from
[18:56.120 --> 19:02.200]  C.Span and Fox News Bolton and crowd hammer running around lying exaggerating saying
[19:02.200 --> 19:06.280]  Russia was gonna invade all the other countries saying troops need to be moved in U.S. troops
[19:06.280 --> 19:13.880]  into Ukraine to face down the Russians one of the oldest parts of the ancient Russian
[19:13.880 --> 19:21.560]  Empire that held back the Muslims is Serbia where three major battles over a 200 plus
[19:21.560 --> 19:33.840]  year period were one where where tens of thousands of slobs died Orthodox Christians
[19:33.840 --> 19:38.920]  defeating the Muslims trying to take over Europe and even before that when there were
[19:38.920 --> 19:45.080]  Mongolian invasions they beat them right there in Serbia right there in Kosovo that is the
[19:45.080 --> 19:49.840]  holy battleground for them U.S. came in blew the hell out of them with Muslim terrorists
[19:49.840 --> 19:56.560]  handed it over to the Muslims in Albania the Russians saw that the globalists have encircled
[19:56.560 --> 19:59.480]  Russia they're trying to launch more attacks

[21:03.120 --> 21:07.080]  familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[21:07.080 --> 21:11.460]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[21:11.460 --> 21:15.640]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional
[21:15.640 --> 21:20.040]  reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate
[21:20.040 --> 21:24.240]  withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to
[21:24.240 --> 21:28.800]  ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[21:28.800 --> 21:33.560]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[21:33.560 --> 21:37.800]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[21:37.800 --> 21:42.600]  inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I recommend a conservative portion
[21:42.600 --> 21:47.680]  of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments
[21:47.680 --> 21:53.120]  currently have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years

[24:24.440 --> 24:31.720]  fox and c span there's two top neocons crownhammer and molten shoot their mouths off and try
[24:31.720 --> 24:37.800]  to escalate the crisis with russia here it is what do you think that rush is up to right
[24:37.800 --> 24:45.200]  now in georgia well i think this is the first step possibly in in putin's effort to recreate
[24:45.200 --> 24:50.160]  the soviet union you know he called the collapse of the soviet union the greatest geopolitical
[24:50.160 --> 24:55.040]  catastrophe of the 20th century and uh... frankly that's one reason i'm disturbed at
[24:55.040 --> 25:01.240]  the administration laid back response because as important as georgia is if this is simply
[25:01.240 --> 25:06.600]  a part of a bigger picture there's a lot more thick russians are advancing there's nothing
[25:06.600 --> 25:11.360]  that will stop them we're not going to go to war over georgia uh... we were unprepared
[25:11.360 --> 25:16.880]  and the georgians were unprepared the question is what can we do uh... the battle and when
[25:16.880 --> 25:24.400]  the russians achieve whatever is that is their objective obviously it starts with the taking
[25:24.400 --> 25:30.280]  over of south ocecha and apcasio which has already happened it goes on to the destruction
[25:30.280 --> 25:36.680]  of the georgian armed force which is now happening and the third will probably be the replacement
[25:36.680 --> 25:42.480]  of the elect of the government which is pro-western with a puppet government which will probably
[25:42.480 --> 25:48.280]  follow in the next a week or two there's nothing that we can do but now short of a military
[25:48.280 --> 25:53.160]  attack that would reverse that but what we can do is to put sanctions on the russians
[25:53.160 --> 25:58.400]  which might induce them over time to undo a few of these steps and the first it would
[25:58.400 --> 26:04.640]  be immediately to declare that we are going to protect ukraine which is the next step
[26:04.640 --> 26:10.200]  the ukraine is a big prize here perhaps station the troops and perhaps to begin an admission
[26:10.200 --> 26:14.200]  process of ukraine into nato
[26:14.200 --> 26:18.760]  now what they're doing is the west is
[26:18.760 --> 26:21.480]  the same elite that's enslaving us
[26:21.480 --> 26:25.880]  has launched a provocative sneak attack on the russians lied to the dumb down population
[26:25.880 --> 26:27.520]  and told them that russia
[26:27.520 --> 26:31.840]  out of the clear blue just attack georgia for no reason
[26:31.840 --> 26:34.120]  and claim that
[26:34.120 --> 26:36.160]  russia violated international law
[26:36.160 --> 26:39.080]  when in truth the united states israel in nato
[26:39.080 --> 26:41.840]  with a sneak attack violated international law
[26:41.840 --> 26:43.840]  that was an international zone
[26:43.840 --> 26:46.680]  russia was following the the the treaty
[26:46.680 --> 26:51.240]  a treaty was violated in a sneak attack as dash really is against but they know the public
[26:51.240 --> 26:54.480]  doesn't know what you which ends up or even what continent they live on
[26:54.480 --> 26:56.680]  the public doesn't have any idea on average
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.280]  no idea about anything
[26:58.280 --> 26:59.560]  how anything works
[26:59.560 --> 27:01.280]  until they can lie and say this
[27:01.280 --> 27:03.320]  russia has now stopped
[27:03.320 --> 27:06.880]  uh... they are saying we're not gonna allow any weapons to be shipped in from israel
[27:06.880 --> 27:07.840]  or nato
[27:07.840 --> 27:11.920]  for a counter attack against them after they've already repulsed one attack
[27:11.920 --> 27:12.880]  meanwhile
[27:12.880 --> 27:15.280]  they're moving missile systems radar
[27:15.280 --> 27:18.160]  uh... there are thousands of u.s. troops currently in ukraine they've been there
[27:18.160 --> 27:19.760]  for at least seven years
[27:19.760 --> 27:22.440]  there is a massive build up russia saying stop it
[27:22.440 --> 27:23.680]  and there are several
[27:23.680 --> 27:26.560]  russian enclaves on the border with russia there as well
[27:26.560 --> 27:31.280]  and look for the last to start another fight there and then say oh my god
[27:31.280 --> 27:36.160]  we snuck attack the russians again and they had a reserve response to us and
[27:36.160 --> 27:36.840]  only
[27:36.840 --> 27:39.680]  defended themselves out there them
[27:39.680 --> 27:42.320]  help their them fight back when they're snuck attack
[27:42.320 --> 27:45.600]  you're gonna see that which with uh... i ran at the attack i ran the next few
[27:45.600 --> 27:50.000]  months which it looks like they may be planning to do i pray it doesn't happen
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.760]  then when i ran fights back in any way if they shoot a peace shooter
[27:53.760 --> 27:55.400]  or a slingshot rock
[27:55.400 --> 27:57.200]  back at any of these missiles
[27:57.200 --> 28:00.120]  or or or munitions being dropped on them
[28:00.120 --> 28:02.360]  it will be all my god
[28:02.360 --> 28:05.480]  all my god i ran snuck attack
[28:05.480 --> 28:08.520]  or matter of the u.s. is bombarding them for a week before they respond
[28:08.520 --> 28:10.160]  they'll just tell the public
[28:10.160 --> 28:14.280]  we did nothing and they attack the public is a my god i ran a tax
[28:14.280 --> 28:18.640]  i mean that is the dumb down nature of this population it is
[28:18.640 --> 28:20.200]  just off the charts
[28:20.200 --> 28:22.120]  hard to believe
[28:22.120 --> 28:24.260]  how bamboozled
[28:24.260 --> 28:25.920]  uh... the public is
[28:25.920 --> 28:28.040]  how how completely buffaloed
[28:28.040 --> 28:29.320]  they are by any
[28:29.320 --> 28:33.160]  level of ridiculous garbage out of the new world order crowd
[28:33.160 --> 28:36.920]  the angle american world empire
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.200]  which we pay for which which which our names destroyed by which our dollar is
[28:41.200 --> 28:46.200]  based on the now being the base to destroy
[28:46.200 --> 28:48.000]  amazing
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.760]  absolutely amazing to see them getting i keep seeing amazing because i am
[28:51.760 --> 28:52.720]  speechless
[28:52.720 --> 28:55.840]  meanwhile the neocons now love international law
[28:55.840 --> 28:58.960]  story up on info wars dot com from the source of news
[28:58.960 --> 29:02.160]  it's touching how american you conservatives have had no regard for
[29:02.160 --> 29:03.240]  international law
[29:03.240 --> 29:05.600]  when they want to invade some troublesome country
[29:05.600 --> 29:09.280]  have developed a sudden reverence for
[29:09.280 --> 29:11.080]  national sovereignty apparently
[29:11.080 --> 29:13.640]  context is everything so the united states attacking granada
[29:13.640 --> 29:15.520]  nicaragua panama
[29:15.520 --> 29:18.040]  iraq and sirby is justified even
[29:18.040 --> 29:21.520]  if the reason sometimes don't hold water or don't hold up before the united
[29:21.520 --> 29:25.920]  nations the hager institutions international law however when russia
[29:25.920 --> 29:29.520]  attacks georgia in a border dispute over georgia's determination to throttle
[29:29.520 --> 29:30.720]  secession movements
[29:30.720 --> 29:32.440]  into semi-autonomous regions
[29:32.440 --> 29:35.040]  everyone must agree that georgia sovereignty of sacrosanct
[29:35.040 --> 29:36.640]  and russia must be condemned
[29:36.640 --> 29:38.360]  u.s. newspapers in the new york times
[29:38.360 --> 29:39.760]  see nothing
[29:39.760 --> 29:43.560]  bad about publishing a sentiment from george w bush declaring that georgia
[29:43.560 --> 29:44.760]  is a sovereign nation
[29:44.760 --> 29:47.040]  and his territorial integrity must be respected
[29:47.040 --> 29:49.880]  no one points out that bush should have zero standing
[29:49.880 --> 29:51.640]  annunciating such a principle

[34:16.600 --> 34:20.600]  Neocons now love international law
[34:22.600 --> 34:26.600]  It's touching how American neoconservatives
[34:26.600 --> 34:30.600]  Who have no regard for international law
[34:30.600 --> 34:33.600]  When they want to invade some troublesome country
[34:33.600 --> 34:36.600]  Have developed a sudden reverence
[34:36.600 --> 34:39.600]  For national sovereignty
[34:44.600 --> 34:46.600]  U.S. newspapers such as The New York Times
[34:46.600 --> 34:50.600]  See nothing wrong with publishing a statement
[34:50.600 --> 34:53.600]  From President George Bush declaring that Georgia
[34:53.600 --> 34:55.600]  Is a sovereign nation
[34:55.600 --> 34:58.600]  And its territorial integrity must be respected
[34:58.600 --> 35:00.600]  No one points out that Bush should have zero standing
[35:00.600 --> 35:02.600]  Annunciating such a principle
[35:02.600 --> 35:04.600]  Iraq also is a sovereign nation
[35:04.600 --> 35:06.600]  But Bush invaded under false pretenses
[35:06.600 --> 35:08.600]  Demolished its army over through its government
[35:08.600 --> 35:11.600]  And then conducted a lengthy military occupation
[35:11.600 --> 35:13.600]  Resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths
[35:13.600 --> 35:15.600]  And I would add our criminal government
[35:15.600 --> 35:18.600]  Put Saddam into power and then set him up
[35:18.600 --> 35:20.600]  To invade Kuwait and attack Iran and everything else
[35:20.600 --> 35:23.600]  So that's even worse
[35:23.600 --> 35:26.600]  And carried out a lengthy military operation
[35:26.600 --> 35:31.600]  And resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead
[35:31.600 --> 35:34.600]  The invasion of Iraq also
[35:34.600 --> 35:36.600]  Wasn't a spur of the moment decision
[35:36.600 --> 35:38.600]  In the months after the 9-11 attacks Bush proclaimed
[35:38.600 --> 35:40.600]  An exceptional right of the United States
[35:40.600 --> 35:42.600]  To invade any country that might become
[35:42.600 --> 35:44.600]  A threat to American security or the U.S.
[35:44.600 --> 35:47.600]  Global dominance
[35:47.600 --> 35:49.600]  Remember all the speeches he gave
[35:49.600 --> 35:51.600]  When asked questions about international law
[35:51.600 --> 35:53.600]  Bush would joke and say international law
[35:53.600 --> 35:55.600]  I better call my lawyer, the neocons contempt
[35:55.600 --> 35:57.600]  For international law goes back even further
[35:57.600 --> 35:59.600]  And then they list all of that
[35:59.600 --> 36:01.600]  I mean think about it, they go in
[36:01.600 --> 36:03.600]  They set up the Taliban in Al-Qaeda
[36:03.600 --> 36:05.600]  They carry out the 9-11 attacks
[36:05.600 --> 36:07.600]  And they claim that Afghanistan did
[36:07.600 --> 36:11.600]  The Taliban chiefs were trying to hand over
[36:11.600 --> 36:14.600]  The subgroup of Taliban
[36:14.600 --> 36:16.600]  That they said hey as your own intelligence operatives
[36:16.600 --> 36:18.600]  Instead they arrested the real Taliban
[36:18.600 --> 36:20.600]  And then flew the U.S.
[36:20.600 --> 36:22.600]  Taliban in Al-Qaeda out to safety
[36:22.600 --> 36:24.600]  6,000 of them to Pakistan
[36:24.600 --> 36:26.600]  In the airlift of evil
[36:26.600 --> 36:28.600]  Just like a few weeks ago it came out
[36:28.600 --> 36:30.600]  In mainstream news that
[36:30.600 --> 36:32.600]  Seattle Times, Miami Herald
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.600]  That bin Laden was driver
[36:34.600 --> 36:36.600]  It was actually a right hand
[36:36.600 --> 36:38.600]  Not his driver who they burned and turned out
[36:38.600 --> 36:40.600]  Got six months in jail as he did nothing
[36:40.600 --> 36:42.600]  They kept him but his bodyguard
[36:42.600 --> 36:44.600]  Who was actually doing things and running things
[36:44.600 --> 36:46.600]  He got to Guantanamo
[36:46.600 --> 36:48.600]  He was grabbing, doing their job
[36:48.600 --> 36:50.600]  And then he was released in one week secretly
[36:50.600 --> 36:52.600]  Because real Al-Qaeda
[36:54.600 --> 36:56.600]  Is run by the New World Order
[37:02.600 --> 37:04.600]  Alright
[37:04.600 --> 37:06.600]  Getting into other
[37:06.600 --> 37:08.600]  Military news
[37:10.600 --> 37:12.600]  China welcomes Russia's
[37:12.600 --> 37:14.600]  Announcement of ceasefire in South Ossetia
[37:14.600 --> 37:16.600]  China said today
[37:16.600 --> 37:18.600]  It welcomed Russia's announcement to in-military operation
[37:18.600 --> 37:20.600]  In Georgia's South Ossetia
[37:20.600 --> 37:22.600]  China welcomes this in hopes that the move can help
[37:22.600 --> 37:24.600]  Peacefully resolve disputes through dialogues
[37:24.600 --> 37:26.600]  And realize peace and stability in the region
[37:26.600 --> 37:28.600]  Said China's foreign ministry
[37:32.600 --> 37:34.600]  Getting into other
[37:34.600 --> 37:36.600]  Russia, Georgia
[37:36.600 --> 37:38.600]  U.S.
[37:38.600 --> 37:40.600]  Israel news, NATO news
[37:40.600 --> 37:42.600]  Obama advisor compares Putin to Hitler
[37:42.600 --> 37:44.600]  In a way that
[37:44.600 --> 37:46.600]  In the discussion we had Friday
[37:46.600 --> 37:48.600]  With Bob Chapman and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[37:48.600 --> 37:50.600]  Roberts is a great guy and we appreciate his
[37:50.600 --> 37:52.600]  His input. Roberts was saying
[37:52.600 --> 37:54.600]  Well, no, Brigadier Brzezinski isn't involved in any of this
[37:54.600 --> 37:56.600]  This is the neocons
[37:56.600 --> 37:58.600]  And Bob Chapman
[37:58.600 --> 38:00.600]  And rightfully so
[38:00.600 --> 38:02.600]  Webster Tarpoli have said no
[38:02.600 --> 38:04.600]  This is the policy
[38:04.600 --> 38:06.600]  Directive by the big Rothschild
[38:06.600 --> 38:08.600]  Elite basically out of England
[38:08.600 --> 38:10.600]  To
[38:10.600 --> 38:12.600]  In-circle and attack Russia
[38:12.600 --> 38:14.600]  And the neocons now are becoming more and more
[38:14.600 --> 38:16.600]  Back-seaters
[38:16.600 --> 38:18.600]  Obama advisor compares
[38:18.600 --> 38:20.600]  Putin to Hitler and this is London Guardian today
[38:20.600 --> 38:22.600]  Illustrating that. It is Brzezinski
[38:22.600 --> 38:24.600]  Driving much of this. The former U.S.
[38:24.600 --> 38:26.600]  National Security Advisers as a big Brzezinski has called
[38:26.600 --> 38:28.600]  For the world community to isolate Russia
[38:28.600 --> 38:30.600]  In protest over its campaign and the caucuses
[38:30.600 --> 38:32.600]  Likening its tactics to those of
[38:32.600 --> 38:34.600]  Hitler or Stalin
[38:36.600 --> 38:38.600]  Brzezinski who was
[38:38.600 --> 38:40.600]  The National Security Advisor and President Jimmy Carter
[38:40.600 --> 38:42.600]  And is now an advisor
[38:42.600 --> 38:44.600]  Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama
[38:44.600 --> 38:46.600]  Said the Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin
[38:46.600 --> 38:48.600]  Was following a course that is horrifyingly similar
[38:48.600 --> 38:50.600]  To that taken by Stalin and Hitler in the 1930s
[38:52.600 --> 38:54.600]  Really, I thought it was Stalin and Hitler
[38:54.600 --> 38:56.600]  Sneak attacking people, not the other way around
[38:56.600 --> 38:58.600]  Russia attacked no one
[38:58.600 --> 39:00.600]  He said that Putin's justification
[39:00.600 --> 39:02.600]  For splitting up Georgia because of the Russian
[39:02.600 --> 39:04.600]  Citizens living in South Ossetia could be
[39:04.600 --> 39:06.600]  Compared to when Hitler used the alleged suffering
[39:06.600 --> 39:08.600]  Of ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland
[39:08.600 --> 39:10.600]  As a pretext of annexing Czechoslovakia in
[39:10.600 --> 39:12.600]  1938
[39:12.600 --> 39:14.600]  Well, they have
[39:14.600 --> 39:16.600]  Not annexed anything. The Russians have always been
[39:16.600 --> 39:18.600]  In Ossetia and Abkhazia and other
[39:18.600 --> 39:20.600]  Areas. The Russians were attacked
[39:22.600 --> 39:24.600]  Georgia has historically been part of
[39:26.600 --> 39:28.600]  Russia. I'm surprised
[39:28.600 --> 39:30.600]  To secure their flank. Russia didn't go
[39:30.600 --> 39:32.600]  In to Tbilisi and take over
[39:32.600 --> 39:34.600]  The capital and throw out
[39:34.600 --> 39:36.600]  The puppet
[39:38.600 --> 39:40.600]  In an interview with a conservative
[39:40.600 --> 39:42.600]  Daily German DeWeld
[39:42.600 --> 39:44.600]  He said even more striking were the parallels
[39:44.600 --> 39:46.600]  Between Putin's strategy against Georgia and Stalin's
[39:46.600 --> 39:48.600]  Invasion of Finland in 1939 describing both
[39:48.600 --> 39:50.600]  As undermining of the sovereignty
[39:50.600 --> 39:52.600]  Of a small democratic neighboring state
[39:52.600 --> 39:54.600]  Through the use of violence. Hey, who used violence first?
[39:54.600 --> 39:56.600]  Georgia is to the extent
[39:56.600 --> 39:58.600]  What Finland of today, both morally
[39:58.600 --> 40:00.600]  And strategically, that's not true
[40:00.600 --> 40:02.600]  Georgia is
[40:02.600 --> 40:04.600]  Totally tied to Russia historically
[40:04.600 --> 40:06.600]  Finland isn't. Except in trade
[40:06.600 --> 40:08.600]  There in the North Sea.
[40:08.600 --> 40:10.600]  So just more incredible propaganda
[40:10.600 --> 40:12.600]  EU may send peacekeepers to
[40:12.600 --> 40:14.600]  Enforce ceasefire in South Ossetia
[40:14.600 --> 40:16.600]  European Union could send peacekeepers
[40:16.600 --> 40:18.600]  To the breakaway region of South Ossetia
[40:18.600 --> 40:20.600]  I guess to back up more sneak attacks against the Russians
[40:20.600 --> 40:22.600]  To help enforce a ceasefire between Russia and Georgia
[40:22.600 --> 40:24.600]  EU foreign ministers announced
[40:24.600 --> 40:26.600]  Support with the plan to send peacekeepers
[40:26.600 --> 40:28.600]  As an emergency meeting in Brussels today
[40:28.600 --> 40:30.600]  Russia has stopped their advance
[40:30.600 --> 40:32.600]  They wiped out the military forces
[40:32.600 --> 40:34.600]  That attacked them when they tried to regroup
[40:34.600 --> 40:36.600]  Just ten miles south of Ossetia
[40:36.600 --> 40:38.600]  They attacked them
[40:38.600 --> 40:40.600]  While the Georgians were still
[40:40.600 --> 40:42.600]  Launching rocket attacks
[40:42.600 --> 40:44.600]  The Irish
[40:44.600 --> 40:46.600]  Development Minister Peter Power said the EU
[40:46.600 --> 40:48.600]  Was ready to engage including on the ground
[40:48.600 --> 40:50.600]  To support the efforts of the United Nations
[40:50.600 --> 40:52.600]  On the OSCE
[40:52.600 --> 40:54.600]  Organization for Economic Co-operative Development
[40:54.600 --> 40:56.600]  And that's the real bankruptcy
[40:56.600 --> 40:58.600]  Arm that grew out of
[40:58.600 --> 41:00.600]  The Marshall Plan with the Germans
[41:00.600 --> 41:02.600]  And if you really want to know who manages things
[41:02.600 --> 41:04.600]  And sets international treaties
[41:04.600 --> 41:06.600]  And who's more powerful than the IMF
[41:06.600 --> 41:08.600]  And World Bank and sits above those
[41:08.600 --> 41:10.600]  It is the Organization for Economic Co-operative Development
[41:10.600 --> 41:12.600]  I would have
[41:12.600 --> 41:14.600]  He added the details of the EU peacekeeping plan
[41:14.600 --> 41:16.600]  Would be discussed in the meeting next month
[41:16.600 --> 41:18.600]  So you see they were having trouble getting Georgia
[41:18.600 --> 41:20.600]  Into NATO now they're saying well those hopes are
[41:20.600 --> 41:22.600]  Dashed but really
[41:22.600 --> 41:24.600]  By
[41:24.600 --> 41:26.600]  Fiat it is becoming part of NATO
[41:26.600 --> 41:28.600]  State
[41:28.600 --> 41:30.600]  Just like they had the Muslims out of Albania
[41:30.600 --> 41:32.600]  For several years attacked the Serbs
[41:32.600 --> 41:34.600]  Till they repulsed their attack
[41:34.600 --> 41:36.600]  In Serbia proper
[41:36.600 --> 41:38.600]  That's what Kosovo was
[41:38.600 --> 41:40.600]  Then the United Nations and NATO forces took over
[41:40.600 --> 41:42.600]  Forcibly
[41:42.600 --> 41:44.600]  Removed the
[41:44.600 --> 41:46.600]  Serbian security forces built up
[41:46.600 --> 41:48.600]  Armaments in the country and began
[41:48.600 --> 41:50.600]  Ethnic cleansing against Serbs
[41:50.600 --> 41:52.600]  And forced them out of the country which is now
[41:52.600 --> 41:54.600]  Totally fallen last year to the Muslims
[41:54.600 --> 41:56.600]  Recognized and now part of Albania
[41:58.600 --> 42:00.600]  Think about that
[42:00.600 --> 42:02.600]  They are stealing countries
[42:02.600 --> 42:04.600]  They are taking over nations
[42:04.600 --> 42:06.600]  They are bringing Muslims in
[42:06.600 --> 42:08.600]  While they talk all day about giving up your rights
[42:08.600 --> 42:10.600]  Because even evil Muslims are going to get you any minute
[42:10.600 --> 42:12.600]  Meanwhile every time we turn around
[42:12.600 --> 42:14.600]  They're using Muslim shock forces
[42:14.600 --> 42:16.600]  To take over Afghanistan
[42:16.600 --> 42:18.600]  To take over Iran
[42:18.600 --> 42:20.600]  To take over Serbia and Kosovo
[42:20.600 --> 42:22.600]  To take over
[42:22.600 --> 42:24.600]  Different sectors
[42:24.600 --> 42:26.600]  In the south of Georgia
[42:26.600 --> 42:28.600]  This is an absorption
[42:28.600 --> 42:30.600]  It's like Israel helped create
[42:30.600 --> 42:32.600]  Hamas
[42:32.600 --> 42:34.600]  In the 1970s as a
[42:34.600 --> 42:36.600]  This is mainstream Israeli news
[42:36.600 --> 42:38.600]  As a counterweight to Hezbollah
[42:38.600 --> 42:40.600]  Playing the Shiites
[42:40.600 --> 42:42.600]  And
[42:42.600 --> 42:44.600]  Sunnis off against each other
[42:46.600 --> 42:48.600]  The plan is total vulcanization
[42:48.600 --> 42:50.600]  Including here in the United States with the southwest
[42:50.600 --> 42:52.600]  Being handed over to Mexican nationals
[42:52.600 --> 42:54.600]  You see the same program over and over again
[42:54.600 --> 42:56.600]  You're getting deep analysis here ladies and gentlemen
[43:00.600 --> 43:02.600]  That is a horrible escalation
[43:02.600 --> 43:04.600]  To move in
[43:04.600 --> 43:06.600]  NATO and EU troops
[43:08.600 --> 43:10.600]  By the way
[43:10.600 --> 43:12.600]  The Russians knew an attack was coming
[43:12.600 --> 43:14.600]  Because they had NATO and UN troops
[43:14.600 --> 43:16.600]  Who the day before started disappearing
[43:16.600 --> 43:18.600]  From the different
[43:18.600 --> 43:20.600]  Security bases in South Ossetia
[43:22.600 --> 43:24.600]  And the other breakaway republic
[43:24.600 --> 43:26.600]  Bordering Russia
[43:26.600 --> 43:28.600]  In the north of Georgia
[43:28.600 --> 43:30.600]  That's why Russian troops were able to mass on the border
[43:30.600 --> 43:32.600]  Knowing an attack was coming
[43:32.600 --> 43:34.600]  In the next days or weeks
[43:34.600 --> 43:36.600]  Hey where are the UN guys
[43:36.600 --> 43:38.600]  Hey where are the
[43:38.600 --> 43:40.600]  There were Georgian peacekeepers mixing with them
[43:40.600 --> 43:42.600]  Where are they, where did everybody go
[43:42.600 --> 43:44.600]  Incoming rocket attacks
[43:44.600 --> 43:46.600]  Massive
[43:46.600 --> 43:48.600]  11,000 man attack force
[43:48.600 --> 43:50.600]  Just moving in with huge
[43:50.600 --> 43:52.600]  Self-propelled rocket batteries
[43:52.600 --> 43:54.600]  Tanks, helicopters, fighter jets
[43:54.600 --> 43:56.600]  Led by US and Israeli forces
[43:56.600 --> 43:58.600]  Smashing in mass murdering thousands
[44:02.600 --> 44:04.600]  Adastardly wicked
[44:04.600 --> 44:06.600]  I mean the history of warfare sneak attacks
[44:06.600 --> 44:08.600]  Are just
[44:08.600 --> 44:10.600]  And not a sneak attack once a war is already going
[44:10.600 --> 44:12.600]  But a sneak attack
[44:12.600 --> 44:14.600]  Not even a sneak attack during a truce
[44:14.600 --> 44:16.600]  And I've got people
[44:16.600 --> 44:18.600]  On the info wars dot com
[44:18.600 --> 44:20.600]  Message board
[44:20.600 --> 44:22.600]  Essentially people posting on the
[44:22.600 --> 44:24.600]  Stories as the message board
[44:24.600 --> 44:26.600]  And on the present planet message board saying we're lying
[44:26.600 --> 44:28.600]  And that Russia attacked Georgia
[44:28.600 --> 44:30.600]  Out of the blue
[44:30.600 --> 44:32.600]  And I had a caller yesterday
[44:32.600 --> 44:34.600]  Who I recognized as a routine caller
[44:34.600 --> 44:36.600]  Who supposedly likes the show saying
[44:36.600 --> 44:38.600]  The domino effect, the russians attack
[44:38.600 --> 44:40.600]  They're taking over, Alex you're siding with the commies
[44:40.600 --> 44:42.600]  The commies
[44:42.600 --> 44:44.600]  Are government, all these hundreds of new
[44:44.600 --> 44:46.600]  Taxes and regulations and face scanning
[44:46.600 --> 44:48.600]  Cameras and black uniforms
[44:48.600 --> 44:50.600]  I mean this is a bunch of bull
[44:50.600 --> 44:52.600]  Russia isn't attacking
[44:52.600 --> 44:54.600]  The United States, it's not attacking our
[44:54.600 --> 44:56.600]  Interest, it wants to sell
[44:56.600 --> 44:58.600]  Technology
[44:58.600 --> 45:00.600]  And oil and raw materials to us
[45:02.600 --> 45:04.600]  I mean I study this
[45:04.600 --> 45:06.600]  I bring the top experts liberal, conservative
[45:06.600 --> 45:08.600]  Libertarian, White House, CIA
[45:08.600 --> 45:10.600]  Foreign, Nobel Prize winners
[45:10.600 --> 45:12.600]  We have real discussions here
[45:20.600 --> 45:22.600]  Coming up economic news, oil rises
[45:22.600 --> 45:24.600]  The first time in four days as dollar weekends
[45:24.600 --> 45:26.600]  FCC commissioner, fairness doctrine
[45:26.600 --> 45:28.600]  Could lead to government regulation of the web
[45:28.600 --> 45:30.600]  That's the FCC chairman on video
[45:30.600 --> 45:32.600]  That's coming up
[45:32.600 --> 45:34.600]  I don't want to hear any more denials about this
[45:34.600 --> 45:36.600]  I'm tired of it
[45:36.600 --> 45:38.600]  Stop, you know we play that CNN clip
[45:38.600 --> 45:40.600]  Where they've declared martial law in a town
[45:40.600 --> 45:42.600]  And say you can't come out of your house even during the day
[45:42.600 --> 45:44.600]  And people are on the comment section saying
[45:44.600 --> 45:46.600]  Alex you know, they say
[45:46.600 --> 45:48.600]  Martial law in the piece but you're
[45:48.600 --> 45:50.600]  Misrepresenting and saying it's bad
[45:50.600 --> 45:52.600]  You know they're just trying to give people safety
[45:52.600 --> 45:54.600]  Oh my god
[45:58.600 --> 46:00.600]  But speaking of the police state, let's shift gears
[46:00.600 --> 46:02.600]  Now
[46:02.600 --> 46:04.600]  Starting 11 years ago
[46:04.600 --> 46:06.600]  Because I'm in Austin kind of the
[46:06.600 --> 46:08.600]  Silicon Valley of the Texas Hill Country
[46:12.600 --> 46:14.600]  And so a lot of the planners live here
[46:14.600 --> 46:16.600]  It's also the capitals
[46:16.600 --> 46:18.600]  We get a lot of state news from the second most popular state
[46:18.600 --> 46:20.600]  And the second geographically largest state
[46:20.600 --> 46:22.600]  After Alaska
[46:22.600 --> 46:24.600]  And so we get sent videos from inside DPS
[46:24.600 --> 46:26.600]  We aired on access
[46:26.600 --> 46:28.600]  Seven, no eight years ago
[46:28.600 --> 46:30.600]  Where the guy shot video of the computer screens
[46:30.600 --> 46:32.600]  I already knew it from federal documents
[46:32.600 --> 46:34.600]  It was already been announced in international agreements
[46:34.600 --> 46:36.600]  It's already a world ID
[46:36.600 --> 46:38.600]  But I had the video inside
[46:38.600 --> 46:40.600]  Where on the inside
[46:40.600 --> 46:42.600]  Of the computer systems
[46:42.600 --> 46:44.600]  Your driver's license is now called a universal
[46:44.600 --> 46:46.600]  ID number
[46:46.600 --> 46:48.600]  A quote national ID card
[46:48.600 --> 46:50.600]  And I showed that to you
[46:50.600 --> 46:52.600]  See now they're just now getting around to announcing
[46:52.600 --> 46:54.600]  It's a national ID card this year
[46:54.600 --> 46:56.600]  When we already have a world ID card since
[46:56.600 --> 46:58.600]  2000
[46:58.600 --> 47:00.600]  A national ID card under executive order since 93
[47:00.600 --> 47:02.600]  Your local driver's license and ID cards
[47:02.600 --> 47:04.600]  Are federal
[47:04.600 --> 47:06.600]  Now they're international
[47:06.600 --> 47:08.600]  See once it's federalized then it can be internationalized
[47:08.600 --> 47:10.600]  Called
[47:20.600 --> 47:22.600]  Oh boy
[47:22.600 --> 47:24.600]  Munialization
[47:26.600 --> 47:28.600]  So
[47:28.600 --> 47:30.600]  All of this is unfolding and happening
[47:30.600 --> 47:32.600]  And so let me just tell you
[47:32.600 --> 47:34.600]  I learned 10, 11 years ago
[47:34.600 --> 47:36.600]  Before it was ever even in
[47:36.600 --> 47:38.600]  Industry publications
[47:38.600 --> 47:40.600]  Nine years ago
[47:40.600 --> 47:42.600]  That the cameras they were putting up all over the country
[47:42.600 --> 47:44.600]  Were hooked into FEMA
[47:44.600 --> 47:46.600]  Hooked into Northcom was already set up at the time
[47:46.600 --> 47:48.600]  Though not publicly
[47:48.600 --> 47:50.600]  And they were watching everyone in live time
[47:50.600 --> 47:52.600]  And scanning all of your license plates in real time
[47:52.600 --> 47:54.600]  And they were going to introduce it to the public as quote
[47:54.600 --> 47:56.600]  Local traffic management to the local emergency center
[47:56.600 --> 47:58.600]  But that was really a federalization center
[47:58.600 --> 48:00.600]  And I told you
[48:00.600 --> 48:02.600]  And then I remember eight years ago
[48:02.600 --> 48:04.600]  The first town announced in Florida
[48:04.600 --> 48:06.600]  Every car that drives through our city
[48:06.600 --> 48:08.600]  We run your plates
[48:08.600 --> 48:10.600]  You're guilty until proven innocent
[48:10.600 --> 48:12.600]  It violates the fourth amendment
[48:12.600 --> 48:14.600]  They do it and then they announced
[48:14.600 --> 48:16.600]  Oh the state of Indiana is doing it seven years ago
[48:16.600 --> 48:18.600]  And oh San Antonio is doing it six years ago
[48:18.600 --> 48:20.600]  And oh Houston and New York and Dallas
[48:20.600 --> 48:22.600]  And hundreds of articles
[48:22.600 --> 48:24.600]  And then it's in matrix of evil
[48:24.600 --> 48:26.600]  Six years ago
[48:26.600 --> 48:28.600]  The governor of
[48:28.600 --> 48:30.600]  Wisconsin
[48:30.600 --> 48:32.600]  Says oh we've put in local federal emergency centers
[48:32.600 --> 48:34.600]  And we're tracking all your cell phones
[48:34.600 --> 48:36.600]  In real time down to a few feet
[48:36.600 --> 48:38.600]  Of where you're at and we can dial in
[48:38.600 --> 48:40.600]  And listen to your phone in case you're in trouble
[48:40.600 --> 48:42.600]  And the police can just dial in your name
[48:42.600 --> 48:44.600]  And pull this up so that was the first thing to implement
[48:44.600 --> 48:46.600]  See they put in the computer systems
[48:46.600 --> 48:48.600]  The federal centers the cops go to
[48:48.600 --> 48:50.600]  And the local managers go to and then they give them upgrades
[48:50.600 --> 48:52.600]  Oh there's this new upgrade
[48:52.600 --> 48:54.600]  It was already all in place
[48:54.600 --> 48:56.600]  There's this new upgrade this week
[48:56.600 --> 48:58.600]  You know you only use this in emergency
[48:58.600 --> 49:00.600]  But you dial up wherever Alex Jones is
[49:00.600 --> 49:02.600]  You want to see where Alex Jones is
[49:02.600 --> 49:04.600]  Enter his name, driver's license number
[49:04.600 --> 49:06.600]  And then it pops up on the screen
[49:06.600 --> 49:08.600]  That's where his cell phone is
[49:08.600 --> 49:10.600]  Now we've got a threat matrix here
[49:10.600 --> 49:12.600]  Of all of his relationships
[49:12.600 --> 49:14.600]  You want to see where his wife is
[49:14.600 --> 49:16.600]  Well you can see a list
[49:16.600 --> 49:18.600]  And punch in this number
[49:18.600 --> 49:20.600]  And then it pulls up where all of his relations are
[49:20.600 --> 49:22.600]  You want to see where his father is
[49:22.600 --> 49:24.600]  You know his first of kin is in red
[49:24.600 --> 49:26.600]  His next level of kin is in blue
[49:26.600 --> 49:28.600]  Then business relations are in green
[49:28.600 --> 49:30.600]  I mean this is what they do
[49:30.600 --> 49:32.600]  And just oh let's see where Alex Jones is
[49:32.600 --> 49:34.600]  Alex Jones
[49:36.600 --> 49:38.600]  There's only in the technocrats in the police departments
[49:38.600 --> 49:40.600]  Merging with the National Guard
[49:40.600 --> 49:42.600]  Merging will have a CIA officer
[49:42.600 --> 49:44.600]  In major cities
[49:44.600 --> 49:46.600]  Liaisoning
[49:46.600 --> 49:48.600]  And they're all there being federalized
[49:48.600 --> 49:50.600]  And right next door in the other wing of the building
[49:50.600 --> 49:52.600]  The National Guard bit whacked
[49:54.600 --> 49:56.600]  Do you understand the magnitude
[49:56.600 --> 49:58.600]  Of this Pentagon design control grid
[49:58.600 --> 50:00.600]  I mean the MIT magazine two years ago admitted
[50:00.600 --> 50:02.600]  Yes it's Pentagon design
[50:02.600 --> 50:04.600]  This is a total control grid
[50:04.600 --> 50:06.600]  A theater of operations
[50:06.600 --> 50:08.600]  No fourth amendment, nothing
[50:08.600 --> 50:10.600]  Now let's expand into England
[50:10.600 --> 50:12.600]  They just calmly announce every day
[50:12.600 --> 50:14.600]  Oh we're tracking your cell phone
[50:14.600 --> 50:16.600]  Everywhere you go in a live time
[50:16.600 --> 50:18.600]  Just like they're doing here
[50:18.600 --> 50:20.600]  Oh we're going ahead and randomly dialing in
[50:20.600 --> 50:22.600]  Listening to your phone
[50:22.600 --> 50:24.600]  Now it's all over England, all over Europe
[50:24.600 --> 50:26.600]  Snoopers chatter
[50:26.600 --> 50:28.600]  To check text and emails, hundreds of public bodies
[50:28.600 --> 50:30.600]  Access personal details
[50:30.600 --> 50:32.600]  Home office measures
[50:32.600 --> 50:34.600]  Driven by EU directives
[50:34.600 --> 50:36.600]  See it's all regionalized
[50:36.600 --> 50:38.600]  Local councils, that's local government
[50:38.600 --> 50:40.600]  Health authorities and hundreds of other public bodies
[50:40.600 --> 50:42.600]  Are now to be given the power to access details
[50:42.600 --> 50:44.600]  Of everyone's personal text messages
[50:44.600 --> 50:46.600]  You see they're in your phone, they hit one button
[50:46.600 --> 50:48.600]  No warrant, no nothing, folks
[50:48.600 --> 50:50.600]  This is why they had to have Congress pass a law saying
[50:50.600 --> 50:52.600]  No warrant snooping
[50:52.600 --> 50:54.600]  This is total tyranny
[50:54.600 --> 50:56.600]  And they're doing this so they can move militarily against us
[50:56.600 --> 50:58.600]  And we can't stop them
[51:00.600 --> 51:02.600]  Hey Clyde
[51:02.600 --> 51:04.600]  What's up Bonnie?
[51:04.600 --> 51:06.600]  I got a question about those shielded secure sleeves
[51:06.600 --> 51:08.600]  From identity stronghold
[51:08.600 --> 51:10.600]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing account numbers
[51:10.600 --> 51:12.600]  From the new credit cards with RFID chips
[51:12.600 --> 51:14.600]  What about them?
[51:14.600 --> 51:16.600]  Start saving hundreds of dollars in fees
[51:16.600 --> 51:18.600]  And interest payments
[51:18.600 --> 51:20.600]  Care 1 agencies have helped over 4 million people
[51:20.600 --> 51:22.600]  Get out of debt and they can help you too
[51:22.600 --> 51:24.600]  Call 800-498-2981
[51:24.600 --> 51:26.600]  Call 800-498-2981
[51:26.600 --> 51:28.600]  Call 800-498-2981
[51:28.600 --> 51:30.600]  And find out how you can lower your monthly payments
[51:30.600 --> 51:32.600]  Up to 57%
[51:32.600 --> 51:34.600]  One 15 minute phone call
[51:34.600 --> 51:36.600]  Can change your life
[51:36.600 --> 51:38.600]  Call 800-498-2981
[51:38.600 --> 51:40.600]  Call 800-498-2981
[51:40.600 --> 51:42.600]  Provider and licensing details are available
[51:42.600 --> 51:44.600]  Provider and licensing details are available
[52:14.600 --> 52:16.600]  When I was just a baby
[52:16.600 --> 52:18.600]  When I was just a baby
[52:18.600 --> 52:20.600]  My mama told me son
[52:20.600 --> 52:22.600]  Always be a good boy
[52:22.600 --> 52:24.600]  Don't ever play with guys
[52:24.600 --> 52:26.600]  But I shot a man in Reno
[52:26.600 --> 52:28.600]  Just to watch him die
[52:32.600 --> 52:34.600]  When I hear that whistle blowin'
[52:34.600 --> 52:41.600]  I hang my head and cry
[52:41.600 --> 52:43.600]  Local governments
[52:43.600 --> 52:44.600]  Health authorities
[52:44.600 --> 52:45.600]  Hundreds of other public bodies
[52:45.600 --> 52:46.600]  Are to be given the power
[52:46.600 --> 52:47.600]  To access your details
[52:47.600 --> 52:48.600]  Everyone's personal text
[52:48.600 --> 52:49.600]  Emails, internet use
[52:49.600 --> 52:51.600]  Under home office proposals
[52:51.600 --> 52:52.600]  Published yesterday
[52:52.600 --> 52:53.600]  Now you actually read
[52:53.600 --> 52:54.600]  They're already doing it
[52:54.600 --> 52:55.600]  Many years in England
[52:55.600 --> 52:57.600]  Just like when they had a quote
[52:57.600 --> 52:59.600]  Healthcare
[52:59.600 --> 53:01.600]  Privacy Act in 2004
[53:01.600 --> 53:02.600]  What it actually did
[53:02.600 --> 53:04.600]  Was all of your healthcare data
[53:04.600 --> 53:06.600]  All of your information
[53:06.600 --> 53:08.600]  Any pharmacy that ever
[53:08.600 --> 53:09.600]  Takes any Medicare or Medicaid
[53:09.600 --> 53:10.600]  Not just from you
[53:10.600 --> 53:11.600]  But from anybody
[53:11.600 --> 53:12.600]  So basically everyone
[53:12.600 --> 53:13.600]  That's where Ron Paul's office
[53:13.600 --> 53:14.600]  Practice doesn't take it
[53:14.600 --> 53:16.600]  When he was doing it
[53:16.600 --> 53:18.600]  Is instantly uploaded
[53:18.600 --> 53:19.600]  To the federal government
[53:19.600 --> 53:21.600]  No judge, no jury, no warrant
[53:21.600 --> 53:23.600]  Just like the know-your-customer
[53:23.600 --> 53:24.600]  Stuff with banking
[53:24.600 --> 53:25.600]  Everything, the government's
[53:25.600 --> 53:27.600]  In your bank account
[53:27.600 --> 53:28.600]  And of course they're stealing
[53:28.600 --> 53:29.600]  That a lot of crooks in government
[53:29.600 --> 53:30.600]  That's why there's so much
[53:30.600 --> 53:31.600]  Most of your identity theft
[53:31.600 --> 53:32.600]  Is government stealing
[53:32.600 --> 53:33.600]  In some cases it's come out
[53:33.600 --> 53:34.600]  Millions of names
[53:34.600 --> 53:36.600]  They sell them to foreign crime
[53:36.600 --> 53:37.600]  Grips who then steal
[53:37.600 --> 53:38.600]  Your information
[53:38.600 --> 53:40.600]  Steal credit card information
[53:40.600 --> 53:42.600]  And then buy things with it
[53:42.600 --> 53:44.600]  It's just a criminal government
[53:44.600 --> 53:45.600]  The whole government's built
[53:45.600 --> 53:49.600]  For criminals to rob you
[53:49.600 --> 53:50.600]  And the same thing happening
[53:50.600 --> 53:51.600]  In England is happening here
[53:51.600 --> 53:52.600]  Ministers want to make it mandatory
[53:52.600 --> 53:53.600]  For telephone and internet companies
[53:53.600 --> 53:54.600]  To keep the tales of all personal
[53:54.600 --> 53:55.600]  Internet traffic
[53:55.600 --> 53:56.600]  For 12 months at least
[53:56.600 --> 53:57.600]  So it can be accessed
[53:57.600 --> 53:58.600]  By investigators into crime
[53:58.600 --> 54:00.600]  Or other threats of public safety
[54:00.600 --> 54:01.600]  They will have instant access
[54:01.600 --> 54:02.600]  To all of it in real time
[54:02.600 --> 54:03.600]  And it just goes on
[54:03.600 --> 54:06.600]  And that's under the EU constitution
[54:06.600 --> 54:07.600]  Which England's already under
[54:07.600 --> 54:09.600]  Following the orders
[54:09.600 --> 54:11.600]  It's like we're under the NAU
[54:11.600 --> 54:12.600]  But they won't tell you that
[54:12.600 --> 54:13.600]  Let's go ahead and play
[54:13.600 --> 54:15.600]  Part of the CBS news piece
[54:15.600 --> 54:17.600]  New York City police propose
[54:17.600 --> 54:19.600]  Massive public snooping system
[54:19.600 --> 54:20.600]  It's already in
[54:20.600 --> 54:21.600]  And notice how they just say
[54:21.600 --> 54:22.600]  Oh, they'll keep your data
[54:22.600 --> 54:24.600]  No, they're lifetime scanning it
[54:24.600 --> 54:26.600]  And it's all federal
[54:26.600 --> 54:27.600]  Remember when you heard
[54:27.600 --> 54:28.600]  Five years ago that
[54:28.600 --> 54:30.600]  Oh, $3 billion in new camera systems
[54:30.600 --> 54:32.600]  By the Feds for New York
[54:32.600 --> 54:34.600]  $2 billion for Boston
[54:34.600 --> 54:37.600]  $600 to something million for Dallas
[54:37.600 --> 54:39.600]  $500 something million for San Antonio
[54:39.600 --> 54:41.600]  Remember hearing all that?
[54:41.600 --> 54:44.600]  Oh, tens of millions for new microphones
[54:44.600 --> 54:45.600]  Gunshot detectors
[54:45.600 --> 54:47.600]  Which are microphones
[54:47.600 --> 54:48.600]  You actually read
[54:48.600 --> 54:50.600]  The federal grant for Austin
[54:56.600 --> 54:57.600]  And your local police departments
[54:57.600 --> 54:58.600]  Are being turned into
[54:58.600 --> 54:59.600]  Intelligence agencies
[54:59.600 --> 55:01.600]  Here's the New York CBS piece
[55:01.600 --> 55:02.600]  Introducing you that it's
[55:02.600 --> 55:03.600]  Escape from New York
[55:03.600 --> 55:04.600]  That New York is to be a
[55:04.600 --> 55:05.600]  Total control grid prison
[55:05.600 --> 55:06.600]  With every person
[55:06.600 --> 55:07.600]  Entering men's scan
[55:07.600 --> 55:08.600]  And database narratives
[55:08.600 --> 55:10.600]  NYPD is reportedly working
[55:10.600 --> 55:11.600]  On a plan to track every vehicle
[55:11.600 --> 55:12.600]  That enters Manhattan
[55:12.600 --> 55:14.600]  Operation Sentinel is aimed
[55:14.600 --> 55:16.600]  At preventing terror attacks
[55:16.600 --> 55:18.600]  CBS 2's Deborah Garcia
[55:18.600 --> 55:19.600]  Has more live from
[55:19.600 --> 55:20.600]  Lower Manhattan
[55:20.600 --> 55:21.600]  Deborah, good morning
[55:21.600 --> 55:22.600]  Good morning Kate
[55:22.600 --> 55:23.600]  That's right
[55:23.600 --> 55:24.600]  Operation Sentinel
[55:24.600 --> 55:25.600]  Is aimed at preventing
[55:25.600 --> 55:26.600]  Another terror attack
[55:26.600 --> 55:27.600]  With the use of cameras
[55:27.600 --> 55:29.600]  And radiation sensors
[55:29.600 --> 55:31.600]  Police reportedly plan to track
[55:31.600 --> 55:33.600]  Anyone or anything suspicious
[55:33.600 --> 55:35.600]  Entering Manhattan
[55:35.600 --> 55:36.600]  The New York police department
[55:36.600 --> 55:38.600]  Reportedly wants to photograph
[55:38.600 --> 55:40.600]  The license plates of every vehicle
[55:40.600 --> 55:41.600]  Coming into Manhattan
[55:41.600 --> 55:42.600]  And keep the image
[55:42.600 --> 55:44.600]  And information in the database
[55:44.600 --> 55:45.600]  The plan is all part of
[55:45.600 --> 55:46.600]  Operation Sentinel
[55:46.600 --> 55:48.600]  And is detailed in today's
[55:48.600 --> 55:49.600]  New York Times
[55:49.600 --> 55:50.600]  The proposal is part of
[55:50.600 --> 55:51.600]  A multi-million dollar plan
[55:51.600 --> 55:53.600]  To secure lower Manhattan
[55:53.600 --> 55:55.600]  It includes cameras, license plate
[55:55.600 --> 55:57.600]  Readers, and radiation detectors
[55:57.600 --> 55:58.600]  They would be set up
[55:58.600 --> 56:00.600]  At seven vehicle crossings
[56:00.600 --> 56:02.600]  The Brooklyn Battery, Holland, Lincoln
[56:02.600 --> 56:04.600]  And Queens Midtown Tunnels
[56:04.600 --> 56:06.600]  Also the George Washington, Henry Hudson
[56:06.600 --> 56:08.600]  And Triboro bridges
[56:08.600 --> 56:09.600]  And also smaller bridges
[56:09.600 --> 56:10.600]  Like the Willis Avenue
[56:10.600 --> 56:12.600]  And McCombs Dam bridges
[56:12.600 --> 56:14.600]  It is unclear exactly
[56:14.600 --> 56:16.600]  When Operation Sentinel would be
[56:16.600 --> 56:17.600]  Okay, let me tell you when it's clear
[56:17.600 --> 56:18.600]  It's already in place
[56:18.600 --> 56:20.600]  And it costs billions, not millions
[56:20.600 --> 56:22.600]  And it's a scanner
[56:22.600 --> 56:25.600]  Here we go

[57:40.600 --> 57:49.600]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[57:49.600 --> 57:51.600]  Big Brother
[57:51.600 --> 57:52.600]  Mainstream media
[57:52.600 --> 57:54.600]  Government cover-ups
[57:54.600 --> 57:56.600]  You want answers?
[57:56.600 --> 57:57.600]  Well, so does he
[57:57.600 --> 58:01.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[58:01.600 --> 58:04.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[58:04.600 --> 58:08.600]  Alex Jones
[58:08.600 --> 58:10.600]  New York City Police propose
[58:10.600 --> 58:12.600]  Massive public snooping system
[58:12.600 --> 58:14.600]  Remember when they propose something that's already in place
[58:14.600 --> 58:16.600]  The whole country has this in place
[58:16.600 --> 58:18.600]  But massive surveillance systems now prevalent in London
[58:18.600 --> 58:21.600]  The burial place of George Arwell
[58:21.600 --> 58:24.600]  America's Big Apple is mulling its own Big Brother Network
[58:24.600 --> 58:25.600]  It's not mulling and it's done
[58:25.600 --> 58:28.600]  In a proposal by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly
[58:28.600 --> 58:31.600]  Operational Sentinel would create a technology surveillance avail
[58:31.600 --> 58:33.600]  That scans license plates and photographs vehicles
[58:33.600 --> 58:36.600]  As they cross all bridges at all entrances and exits
[58:36.600 --> 58:37.600]  All tunnels
[58:37.600 --> 58:40.600]  Then they mix in radiological detectors
[58:40.600 --> 58:42.600]  Which sound reasonable into that
[58:42.600 --> 58:44.600]  To then legitimize the previous thing
[58:44.600 --> 58:47.600]  Would also be installed to sniff out potential terrorism threats
[58:47.600 --> 58:50.600]  Data collected by the snooping would be stored for a month
[58:50.600 --> 58:52.600]  Yeah, right, at a containment center
[58:52.600 --> 58:54.600]  In a command center in Lower Manhattan
[58:54.600 --> 58:56.600]  Oh, the last command center was Building 7
[58:56.600 --> 58:59.600]  The one that blew up at the CIA base in it
[58:59.600 --> 59:02.600]  Those are the centers running everything, scanning everything
[59:02.600 --> 59:04.600]  Those are the CIA bases in your cities
[59:04.600 --> 59:07.600]  In all, some 3,000 public and private security cameras
[59:07.600 --> 59:08.600]  Would be deployed
[59:08.600 --> 59:10.600]  This is just a planning document
[59:10.600 --> 59:13.600]  Said Paul J. Brownie, that's the neutralized resistance
[59:13.600 --> 59:15.600]  A police spokesman to the New York Times
[59:15.600 --> 59:17.600]  It's a vision of how it will work
[59:17.600 --> 59:18.600]  If all the components come together
[59:18.600 --> 59:20.600]  It's already in place hooked into FEMA
[59:20.600 --> 59:22.600]  They're now just training the local police
[59:22.600 --> 59:24.600]  To oversee it themselves
[59:24.600 --> 59:27.600]  Data collected by the snooping would be stored
[59:27.600 --> 59:29.600]  In the International Security Agency
[59:29.600 --> 59:31.600]  And relayed through the command center in Lower Manhattan
[59:31.600 --> 59:34.600]  In all, some 3,000 public and private security cameras
[59:34.600 --> 59:35.600]  Would be deployed
[59:35.600 --> 59:37.600]  This is just a planning document
[59:37.600 --> 59:39.600]  Again, total bull
[59:39.600 --> 59:41.600]  Meanwhile, a little further along
[59:41.600 --> 59:43.600]  In introducing the slaves to their new grid
[59:43.600 --> 59:45.600]  That they live under
[59:45.600 --> 59:47.600]  Local governments, health authorities
[59:47.600 --> 59:49.600]  And hundreds of other public bodies
[59:49.600 --> 59:51.600]  Are to be given the power to access details
[59:51.600 --> 59:53.600]  Of everyone's personal text, emails, and internet use
[59:53.600 --> 59:55.600]  Under home office proposals published yesterday
[59:55.600 --> 59:57.600]  Ministers want to make it mandatory
[59:57.600 --> 59:59.600]  For telephone and internet companies
[59:59.600 --> 1:00:01.600]  And emails of all personal internet traffic
[1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:03.600]  For at least 12 months so it can be accessed
[1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:05.600]  By investigators into crime
[1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:07.600]  Or other threats to public safety
[1:00:07.600 --> 1:00:09.600]  See, just total surveillance, total control
[1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:11.600]  And it came out last year, well, we already know
[1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:15.600]  The queen through MI6 is illegally
[1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:17.600]  Spying on every member of parliament
[1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:19.600]  With human intelligence, people following them
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:21.600]  And every cell phone, every email, every fax
[1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:23.600]  Home phones 24 hours a day
[1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:25.600]  Are listened to by personnel
[1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:28.600]  All the major parties, the 4 major parties in England
[1:00:28.600 --> 1:00:30.600]  Everyone is surveilled by the criminal government
[1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:32.600]  The illegitimate government
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:34.600]  The elected governments are spied on
[1:00:34.600 --> 1:00:36.600]  They're having their authority removed
[1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:38.600]  Militarized black op command bases
[1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:40.600]  Are being built in every city of Europe
[1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:42.600]  England, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand
[1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:46.600]  China is putting in similar centralized control systems
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:48.600]  This is martial law, this is dictatorship
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:50.600]  Scientifically
[1:00:50.600 --> 1:00:52.600]  With crafting and with love
[1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:56.600]  And with time is being put in everywhere
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:58.600]  And it's outrageous
[1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:00.600]  Let's play that clip again
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:02.600]  Because we didn't finish it earlier
[1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:30.600]  Let's play that clip again
[1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:32.600]  The New York police department
[1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:34.600]  Reportedly wants to photograph the license plates
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:36.600]  Of every vehicle coming into Manhattan
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:39.600]  And keep the image and information in a database
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:42.600]  The plan is all part of Operation Sentinel
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:44.600]  And is detailed in today's New York Times
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:47.600]  The proposal is part of a multi-million dollar plan
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:49.600]  To secure lower Manhattan
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.600]  It includes cameras, license plate readers
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.600]  And radiation detectors
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:55.600]  They would be set up at 7 vehicle crossings
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:57.600]  The Brooklyn Battery, Holland, Lincoln
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:01:59.600]  And Queens Midtown Tunnels
[1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:01.600]  Also the George Washington, Henry Hudson
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:03.600]  And Triboro Bridges
[1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:05.600]  And also smaller bridges like the Willis Avenue
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:07.600]  And McCombs Dam Bridges
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:10.600]  It is unclear exactly when Operation Sentinel
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:13.600]  Would be complete, but the lower Manhattan initiative
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:15.600]  Part of the plan to secure the city's financial area
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:20.600]  Is expected to be in place by 2010
[1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:23.600]  And if after a month your license plate number
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:25.600]  Is of no use to them
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.600]  The police will reportedly delete it
[1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:30.600]  Oh, no use to them, no Fourth Amendment
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:32.600]  Now remember, when you get a rent car
[1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:34.600]  Fly on a plane, buy gas
[1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:36.600]  The repaid redact, all that's already uploaded
[1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:39.600]  So they can track everywhere you are at every time
[1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:41.600]  Also tracking by the cell phone
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:43.600]  This is a military supremacist grid
[1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:47.600]  Are you fed up with all the side effects
[1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:50.600]  Of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:53.600]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:55.600]  Most of which are synthetic
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:57.600]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:02:59.600]  Let's not go back to basics
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:01.600]  And be safe with Calvin Pure Soaps
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:03.600]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85%
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:06.600]  The money you're spending for your cleaning products now

[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:50.600]  I've come with a message of information
[1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:52.600]  9-11 was an inside job
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:54.600]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:56.600]  I like being a puppet from the New World Order
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:03:59.600]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:01.600]  Was engineered by you, David Rockefeller
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:03.600]  The Farlatter Commission, the C.A.F.R
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:07.600]  The day that we stop asking questions
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:10.600]  Is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:12.600]  To grow at our own door
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:15.600]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11
[1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:18.600]  A global awakening has taken place
[1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:20.600]  An inside job
[1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:22.600]  How dare you
[1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:25.600]  If you know that there's treason going on
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:27.600]  You can be held accountable for treason yourself
[1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:30.600]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:32.600]  And if the government has not told the truth
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:35.600]  In five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:37.600]  Please rise

[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:51.600]  How much longer
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:54.600]  How much longer will you turn away like a blind man?
[1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:55.600]  How much longer?
[1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:56.600]  The choice
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:58.600]  The choice of life or death
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:01.600]  Abundance or starvation is made today
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:03.600]  Do you have a long-term food solution?

[1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:36.600]  We'll know which one you are
[1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:38.600]  Soon we'll know which one you are
[1:05:38.600 --> 1:05:40.600]  You have no more excuses
[1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:42.600]  You have no more excuses
[1:05:42.600 --> 1:05:49.600]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:51.600]  The Alex Jones Show
[1:05:51.600 --> 1:05:54.600]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:06:14.600]  We are scheduled later in the next hour to have a surprise guest in studio
[1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:19.600]  I want to talk about the new film Fable to Enemies
[1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:22.600]  and what is already a controversial trailer
[1:06:22.600 --> 1:06:24.600]  Trailer number 2
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:26.600]  Fable Enemies Israeli Operatives Trailer 2
[1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:28.600]  The first trailer is out
[1:06:28.600 --> 1:06:30.600]  Now the second trailer is out
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:32.600]  It's going to come out two days before the film's release
[1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:34.600]  September 1
[1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:36.600]  Pre-orders for the DVD start in just a couple days
[1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:40.600]  But let me get back into this control grid
[1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:43.600]  Never before have criminal governments had
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:47.600]  So much power to track, trace, and shut off the ID cards
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:50.600]  Under a new national sales tax they're pushing
[1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:52.600]  When you get cold medicine or cigarettes or beer
[1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:55.600]  Or now paints and just hundreds of different items
[1:06:55.600 --> 1:06:57.600]  Demanding to see your ID
[1:06:57.600 --> 1:07:00.600]  Major gas station chains and other stores are saying
[1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:03.600]  Retail stores are saying, oh we want you to register your ID with us
[1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:06.600]  Before you're allowed to use a credit card
[1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:08.600]  Before you're allowed to get gas
[1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:11.600]  This is the stated plan by the Rand Corporation and others
[1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:13.600]  This is what the Ministry of Defense 10 year plan
[1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:15.600]  By the British put out last year
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:17.600]  The declassified version over 100 pages
[1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:19.600]  States, the military's job
[1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:21.600]  And the surveillance grids
[1:07:21.600 --> 1:07:24.600]  Reason for existence is to control and dominate populations
[1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:27.600]  Because they state they're going to destroy your standard of living
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:29.600]  Tax you at over 80%
[1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:33.600]  Regulate every form of your life, every facet of your life
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:36.600]  Have one child policies, eugenics, forced drugging
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:38.600]  It's all happening
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:40.600]  And they need this electronic straight jacket
[1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:43.600]  Making the country a surveillance prison grid
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:48.600]  Now, they can't have free speech
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:51.600]  While all of this is going on as well
[1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:53.600]  Can they?
[1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:55.600]  No, they can't have free speech
[1:07:55.600 --> 1:07:57.600]  In Europe, here in the United States
[1:07:57.600 --> 1:08:00.600]  And they have used a cocktail
[1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:04.600]  Of different excuses
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:08.600]  First, they arrive at something that everybody should agree with
[1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:11.600]  We shouldn't allow white supremacists
[1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:14.600]  To talk bad about other racial groups in the EU
[1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:16.600]  Doesn't that sound reasonable?
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:18.600]  Let's ban their free speech and give them
[1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:22.600]  Depending on the country, two to ten year prison sentences
[1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:25.600]  For all these different reasons
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:28.600]  And then once that president said, oh now if you criticize the EU
[1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:30.600]  And say bad things about it or say
[1:08:30.600 --> 1:08:32.600]  In a British grocery store
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:34.600]  That we have better strawberries than say French strawberries
[1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:36.600]  That was actually a case for that
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:38.600]  Then you get fined or arrested
[1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:41.600]  If you're a BBC presenter
[1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:44.600]  A rural affairs show called One Man and His Dog
[1:08:44.600 --> 1:08:47.600]  Robin Page, we had on a few years ago
[1:08:47.600 --> 1:08:49.600]  He got up at a council meeting
[1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:51.600]  Before a thousand plus people and said, you know
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:53.600]  Rural communities deserve the same rights as
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:55.600]  Muslims and homosexuals
[1:08:55.600 --> 1:08:57.600]  And they arrested him, they said the word homosexual is hateful
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:08:59.600]  It's a scientific term, like heterosexual, homosexual
[1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:02.600]  But the public's so ignorant, they don't know that
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:04.600]  And so they arrested him
[1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:06.600]  They have snoop squads that go into restaurants
[1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:08.600]  To listen for racial slurs
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:11.600]  While people eat dinner and you're arrested for that
[1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:14.600]  BBC's reported it
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:17.600]  So this is the control grid
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:19.600]  That they are putting in place
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:22.600]  And now, here in the United States
[1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:26.600]  They are trying to implement
[1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:30.600]  Similar things
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:32.600]  So I want to shift gears into that
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:34.600]  FCC commissioner, fairness doctrine
[1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:37.600]  Could lead to government regulation of the web
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:40.600]  Topstoryprisonplanet.com today
[1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:43.600]  McDowell says
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:47.600]  Restrained
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:50.600]  Reinstated powers could be
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:54.600]  Tagged onto net neutrality debate by leading Democrats
[1:09:54.600 --> 1:09:57.600]  McDowell is the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:00.600]  FCC commissioner, Robert McDowell says that the
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:03.600]  Potential reintroduction of the fairness doctrine
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:06.600]  That the Democratic administration could lead to government
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:09.600]  Dissecting content policy on the internet
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:11.600]  The fairness doctrine was an FCC regulation
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:14.600]  Mandating broadcasters of foretime
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:16.600]  To opposing viewpoints
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:18.600]  It was abolished in 1987 by the Supreme Court
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:20.600]  After it was found to be harmful to journalistic freedom
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:22.600]  And anathema for the First Amendment
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:24.600]  Now they were able to carry this out
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:26.600]  Because there was no really independent media in the 80s
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:28.600]  In the 70s and 80s
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:30.600]  Only a few dozen newspaper owners
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:32.600]  Less than a dozen TV network owners
[1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:34.600]  And so they were already playing ball
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:36.600]  And they said, oh there's a law
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:38.600]  You can't even have a guest on who says
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:40.600]  I'm against gun control because
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:42.600]  Then you have to give opposing time to someone who's
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:44.600]  For gun control
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:46.600]  And it was all selectively enforced
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:48.600]  Now this ties into them trying to shut down the web
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:50.600]  Tax it, regulate it
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:52.600]  In net neutrality
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:54.600]  Again that cocktail of ways they're doing this
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:56.600]  And there's political correctness
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:58.600]  If a child draws a picture of their dad
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:00.600]  The Marines with the gun he's arrested
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:02.600]  And the last day of school brings a cake to their teacher
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:04.600]  For an after school party
[1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:06.600]  And the security guard walks in and there's a plastic box
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:08.600]  Of Dixie knives, forks and spoons
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:10.600]  She's arrested
[1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:12.600]  I mean there's hundreds of those cases
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:14.600]  Again it's already there with the young people
[1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:16.600]  Who can't defend themselves and have no idea about
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:18.600]  Liberty and freedom
[1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:20.600]  The younger generation is already deeply under this
[1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:22.600]  And they're trained how to tattle on their parents
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:24.600]  How to spy on their parents
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:26.600]  It goes on and on
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:28.600]  So that's the whole Stasi grid going on
[1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:30.600]  Again
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:32.600]  But let's go ahead and play
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:34.600]  Speaking to the business and media institute
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:36.600]  During a conference, there's a lot of background noise
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:38.600]  You will hear, you can go watch the video
[1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:40.600]  At prismawanna.com, but here is the FCC chairman
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.600]  Admitting that the Democrats in congress
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:44.600]  Have proposed this and this is a
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:46.600]  Real issue coming up
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:48.600]  Here it is
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:50.600]  I think it won't be called the fairness doctrine
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:52.600]  But I think it will be called the fairness doctrine
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:54.600]  By folks who are
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:11:56.600]  Promoting it
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:58.600]  I think it will be called something else
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:00.600]  And I think it will be
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:02.600]  Interfined into the net neutrality debate
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:04.600]  This is actually something we could have
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:06.600]  Talked about in there
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:08.600]  Because there are a few
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:10.600]  Isolated conservatives
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:12.600]  Who might be cherry-picks in the net neutrality
[1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:14.600]  Effort
[1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:16.600]  And I think
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:18.600]  The fear is that somehow large corporations
[1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:20.600]  Will censor their
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:22.600]  Their content
[1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:24.600]  Their point of view
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:26.600]  Right?
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:28.600]  I think the bigger concern
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:30.600]  For them should be
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:32.600]  If you have government
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:34.600]  Dictating content
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:36.600]  Policy, which by the way
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:38.600]  Have a big first amendment problem
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:40.600]  Then
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:42.600]  Whoever is in charge of government
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:44.600]  Is going to determine what is fair
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:46.600]  Under a so called fairness doctrine
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:48.600]  Which won't be called that
[1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:50.600]  Something else
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:52.600]  So will websites
[1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:54.600]  Will bloggers have to give equal time
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:56.600]  Or even space
[1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:58.600]  On their website
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:00.600]  To opposing views
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:02.600]  Rather than letting the marketplace
[1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:04.600]  Of ideas determine that
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:06.600]  So I think it's
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:08.600]  Excellent that you raised that issue
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:10.600]  Stay tuned for
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:12.600]  09 and 2010
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:14.600]  So there you have it
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:16.600]  And that's when they're making their move on the web
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:18.600]  International agencies, international treaty
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:20.600]  It's all hitting next year
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:22.600]  And the year after that, in fact it's already hitting in Canada
[1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:24.600]  They announced three weeks ago
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:26.600]  The two largest telecoms that are over 80% of the market
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:28.600]  Announced they will only allow you to visit
[1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  A couple thousand websites instead of hundreds of millions
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:32.600]  Of sites
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:34.600]  In fact there's billions of pages but several
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:36.600]  Hundred million sites, they said no
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:38.600]  It's going to be like cable
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:40.600]  You will not be allowed to visit other sites
[1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:42.600]  Unless you pay for larger packages
[1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:44.600]  And then that's hijacking our content
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:46.600]  And basically stealing from the alternative media
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:48.600]  But they have to do this
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:50.600]  The mainline media is dying
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:52.600]  The establishment is moving with its police state
[1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:54.600]  The people see it, they've got to come in
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:56.600]  And try to shut this down
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:13:58.600]  It will all be selectively enforced
[1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:00.600]  The corporations will say you can't make that comment
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:02.600]  On our ABC News message board
[1:14:02.600 --> 1:14:04.600]  You can't make that on the Sean Hannity message board
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:06.600]  You can't make a statement
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:08.600]  On this side or that side
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:10.600]  Or infowars.com can't write this article
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  And then we get sued by the government
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:14.600]  Because you're not letting other people
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:16.600]  Have a side on there. It is just totally
[1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:18.600]  On American classical tyranny and it's here
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:20.600]  Just one more
[1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:22.600]  Weapon
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:24.600]  In the arsenal. Now the committees
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:26.600]  Telecommunications committee in the house
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:28.600]  And senate respectively
[1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:30.600]  Have been calling for the reintroduction of the fairness doctrine
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:32.600]  And a huge new federal regulatory body
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:34.600]  Over this and then that dovetails
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:36.600]  With the violent radicalization act
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:38.600]  Where they show architects and engineers for 9-11 truth
[1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:40.600]  Who is saying it's government sponsored
[1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:42.600]  They are just showing the science
[1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:44.600]  Of the buildings collapsing
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:46.600]  With all these engineers and physicists and scientists
[1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:48.600]  They introduce them in congressional hearings
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:50.600]  As a terrorist group
[1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:54.600]  That needs to be regulated and shut down
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:56.600]  And controlled. I mean this isn't a game folks
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:58.600]  This is really happening
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:00.600]  I know it's hard to believe in the land of the free home
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:02.600]  Of the brave that this could be unfolding
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:04.600]  But it's hard to believe that the land of the free home
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:06.600]  Of the brave would launch last thursday night
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:08.600]  On the eve of the olympics
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:10.600]  And they'll back sneak attack
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:12.600]  On russian troops
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:14.600]  And slaughtering them and more than 2,000 civilians
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:16.600]  The number is going to be well over 4,000
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:18.600]  They're not reporting as they dig people out of the rubble
[1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:20.600]  Of osedia and surrounding towns
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:28.600]  Also the CIA
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:30.600]  DARPA
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:32.600]  The advanced research laboratories they created the net
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:34.600]  And so they're just announcing they're going to shut off
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:36.600]  The pathways
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:38.600]  To alternative sites or foreign media sites
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:40.600]  Just like china does with firewalls
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:42.600]  Keyword firewalls
[1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:44.600]  Same thing that cisco
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:46.600]  And oracle and the rest of them have helped design
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:48.600]  For china and other country censoring
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:50.600]  That's now being put in place here
[1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:52.600]  Yahoo Google they're all putting it in place
[1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:54.600]  Admittedly and in running it in china
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:56.600]  They run it for the chinese government and are paid
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:15:58.600]  For those services
[1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:02.600]  And they shut down rusher today that rushes
[1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:04.600]  Basically they're seeing in
[1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:06.600]  Their english service
[1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:08.600]  That was just shut down yesterday
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:10.600]  Most people in the world couldn't get to it in the US
[1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:12.600]  We couldn't get to it we did a story
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:14.600]  Up on prisonplanet.com about that
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:16.600]  We're covering the most important issues
[1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:18.600]  We're tracking and chronicling the new world orders
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:20.600]  Activities
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:22.600]  And we need
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:24.600]  Good police chiefs, good sheriffs, good county commissioners
[1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:26.600]  Good governors if there are any left
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:28.600]  And legislatures
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:30.600]  To say no to all this but the Texas legislature
[1:16:30.600 --> 1:16:32.600]  Says you're not going to take over existing roads
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:34.600]  And foreign companies and tax people
[1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:36.600]  When we've already paid for it
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:38.600]  And Perry says I don't care what you say I'm going to do it
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:40.600]  And then when states start saying no
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:42.600]  Bush comes in with an executive order two weeks ago
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:44.600]  Wall Street Journal reported saying
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:46.600]  I through executive order if you take federal funds
[1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:48.600]  For highways I'm going to force you to give this over
[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:50.600]  To foreign interest
[1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:54.600]  Just like the boxer rebellion
[1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:56.600]  Was triggered with china broken into
[1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:58.600]  10 major parts really about 20
[1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:00.600]  You counted some subregions and Russia
[1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:02.600]  The U.S.
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:04.600]  England, Germany, France, Belgium
[1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:06.600]  The Dutch they all just moved in and broke china
[1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:08.600]  Up in pieces and did the same thing
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:10.600]  They bankrupted them with loans
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:12.600]  Came in militarily took over
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:14.600]  Then when that didn't work
[1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:16.600]  They created the communists as a client state
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:18.600]  As a client government to work with
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:20.600]  They're doing that here
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:22.600]  You look at how they broke up china
[1:17:22.600 --> 1:17:24.600]  They're doing that to us
[1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:26.600]  Because they don't want us to be alone superpower
[1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:28.600]  They don't want us to be a free nation
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:30.600]  We're being absorbed in the world government
[1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:34.600]  Now when we get back
[1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:36.600]  When we get back
[1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:38.600]  I'm going to break down
[1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:40.600]  The Israeli connection to 9-11
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:42.600]  That we've covered at nauseam with other guests
[1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:44.600]  Though folks deny it
[1:17:44.600 --> 1:18:00.600]  We're going to come back we have the new trailer up on it for us
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:03.600]  That's 845 384 1660 and 208 30
[1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:25.600]  The U.S.
[1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:27.600]  dollars free falling against foreign currencies
[1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:29.600]  And countries that previously financed the U.S.
[1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:31.600]  Are now seeking safer alternatives
[1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:33.600]  Economists really boy publish the report bubble leaking

[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:49.600]  It is now time to reign in evil
[1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:51.600]  And bring them to justice
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:53.600]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:55.600]  It is time to destroy the destroyers
[1:18:55.600 --> 1:18:57.600]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million
[1:18:57.600 --> 1:18:59.600]  The vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:01.600]  Though the people of the U.S.
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:03.600]  Where their numbers and influence are strongest
[1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:05.600]  Have primary responsibility for reigning the men
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:07.600]  And bringing them to justice
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:09.600]  All nations will participate
[1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:11.600]  Since they reside the world over
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:13.600]  They are called Illuminati
[1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:15.600]  Elite, proponents of the new world order
[1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:17.600]  They oppose everything that is God and truth
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:19.600]  They are of the line that was disinherited
[1:19:19.600 --> 1:19:21.600]  2000 years ago
[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:23.600]  Everything they have built over the centuries
[1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:25.600]  The wealth they have accumulated
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:27.600]  The power they have established
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:29.600]  The poisoning of the masses
[1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:31.600]  The destruction of the earth and mankind

[1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:47.600]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees
[1:20:47.600 --> 1:20:49.600]  The forces of globalism are destroying
[1:20:49.600 --> 1:20:51.600]  National sovereignty worldwide
[1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:53.600]  But in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope
[1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:55.600]  The first time in modern history
[1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:57.600]  The people are beginning to wake up
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:20:59.600]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:01.600]  Accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:03.600]  Of the new world order master plan
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:05.600]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:07.600]  And energize the people to meet this threat
[1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:09.600]  In the Info War
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:11.600]  We have a powerful weapon in the battle
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:13.600]  To regain our freedom
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:15.600]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information

[1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:35.600]  And so much more
[1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:37.600]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:39.600]  On TV
[1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:41.600]  Burn the Info bombs to disc

[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:45.600]  Bring down the new world order
[1:21:45.600 --> 1:22:11.600]  I used to be such a sweet sweet things
[1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:19.600]  I used to be such a sweet sweet things
[1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:23.600]  I opened doors for little old ladies
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:27.600]  I held the blind to see
[1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:31.600]  I got no friends cause they read the papers
[1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:33.600]  They can't be seen
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:35.600]  With me
[1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:37.600]  And I'm getting real shot down
[1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:39.600]  And I'm

[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:53.600]  That goes for all the enemies of liberty

[1:22:57.600 --> 1:22:59.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:01.600]  People have been accusing me of not being a nice guy
[1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:11.600]  Well, I'm gonna show you
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:15.600]  I got no friends cause they read the papers
[1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:17.600]  They can't be seen
[1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:19.600]  With me
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:21.600]  And I'm getting real shot down

[1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:35.600]  No more
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:37.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:39.600]  No more
[1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:41.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:43.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:45.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:47.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:51.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:53.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:55.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:57.600]  Mr. Nice Guy
[1:23:57.600 --> 1:23:59.920]  managed to stay ahead of them.
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:02.400]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis,
[1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:06.560]  again, very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:24:06.560 --> 1:24:08.960]  Whether it's because they're in intelligence services
[1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:12.240]  or what they were doing, I will defer to the Department
[1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:13.600]  of Justice and the FBI.
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:16.400]  That there was a report on the George Washington Bridge
[1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:20.080]  that there had been a van stop there that had explosives.
[1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:22.920]  We have a suspect who's risen from Georgia's van
[1:24:22.920 --> 1:24:26.080]  at that experience.
[1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:29.680]  Amdox Limited, an Israeli-based private telecommunications
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:31.040]  company.
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:34.680]  It is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones
[1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:37.320]  without generating an Amdox record of it.
[1:24:37.320 --> 1:24:39.160]  It quickly unraveled to be the largest
[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:42.880]  for inspiring ever uncovered inside the United States,
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:44.000]  the largest.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.320]  Documents say they quote, targeted and penetrated military
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:51.080]  bases, the DEA, FBI, and dozens of other government
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:52.040]  facilities.
[1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:55.840]  There's one big elephant in the living room.
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:58.720]  It is the relationship between the United States of America
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:01.120]  and the state of Israel.
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:03.440]  What about this question of advanced knowledge
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:05.520]  of what was going to happen on 9-11?
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:07.400]  Well, it's very explosive information, obviously.
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:10.280]  A bigger question, they say, is how could they not have known?
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:20.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, fabled enemies
[1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:21.880]  is the new film by Jason Burmese.
[1:25:21.880 --> 1:25:25.200]  Now, just three years ago, Dylan Avery made,
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:26.320]  Luce changed the first cut.
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:28.480]  It was only out a few months.
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:30.000]  Then he made the second edition.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.120]  And then finally, about nine months ago,
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:36.680]  we released Final Cut.
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:40.000]  Burmese has always wanted to make this film.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:41.560]  But he wasn't the writer or director.
[1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:42.840]  This is Burmese's film.
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:45.280]  People said, well, why didn't you cover this seven years ago?
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:46.640]  Six and a half years ago?
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:49.280]  Well, actually, my film, Masters of Terror,
[1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:50.960]  does cover the Israeli connection.
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:53.400]  And the Otago Instant Message Company
[1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:56.480]  morning and all of it, in fact, Road to Tyranny covers that.
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:25:58.840]  So actually, I did cover it six and a half years ago.
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:02.040]  I have not just only focused in on the Israeli connection.
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:04.200]  I mean, there's no degrees of separation
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:06.600]  between British, US, and Israeli intelligence.
[1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:07.440]  They're all guilty.
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:08.600]  They're all involved.
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:11.120]  The prime director, obviously, is Dick Cheney
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:13.440]  and those above him and private defense contractors.
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:15.440]  But it's like five guys robbing a bank.
[1:26:15.440 --> 1:26:17.160]  All five are just as guilty.
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:19.320]  For us to give you the big picture and cover it all
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:20.960]  is not holding back on Israel.
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:22.480]  But regardless, we've done this.
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:23.640]  We're big fish.
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:25.000]  I've produced this film.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.240]  I've put this out.
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:28.000]  And we're going to take the heat for it.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.480]  And I knew I'd get heat from one side saying that we're
[1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:31.720]  just bashing Israel.
[1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:34.080]  But I wanted to see what the other side would do.
[1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:36.920]  And of course, they're freaking out even more angry
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:39.560]  because they have it wrong about this show and who we are
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:41.360]  and what we stand for.
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:43.280]  And they can't admit we're good guys.
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:45.480]  They can't admit we cover what's going on.
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:48.400]  We cover Vatican corruption with countless guests.
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:48.920]  Doesn't matter.
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:50.800]  They lie and say we never covered it.
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:53.240]  We cover Israeli corruption, Israeli terror.
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:55.160]  I've got three films with whole sections
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:57.640]  about Israel staging terror attacks, Israel's state.
[1:26:57.640 --> 1:26:58.360]  No, four films.
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:01.120]  Israel staging the attack on the USS Liberty.
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:03.600]  My detractors say, nope, he's never covered it.
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:04.400]  Never talked about it.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:09.800]  Or they will misrepresent and say, oh,
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:11.680]  he says LBJ did the attack on Israel.
[1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:14.520]  No, our federal government was involved with Israel.
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:17.840]  Both co-equal in guilt.
[1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:19.800]  It doesn't give Israel cover.
[1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:21.440]  It shows the larger picture.
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:23.120]  And that's what we strive to do here.
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:24.880]  So I'm going to keep breaking this down
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:27.840]  on the other side, fabled enemies.
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:30.360]  It's only about 15 days until it's released,
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:36.360]  ladies and gentlemen, at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:37.720]  We're on the march.
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:40.200]  The empire's on the run.
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:43.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:49.440]  Alabama State Code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:51.640]  In Downey, California, it's illegal
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:53.240]  to wash your car in the street.
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:55.760]  In Minnesota, you can be fine for displaying
[1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:57.320]  that your vehicle is for sale.
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:27:59.960]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us,
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:02.040]  but instead to help states profit.
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:04.840]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:07.840]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional,
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:10.400]  and cost you valuable time and money.
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:13.040]  Sprayyourplate.com is a spray on photo blocker
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:15.000]  that protects against red light cameras,

[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:23.160]  and each can covers up to four license plates.
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:26.080]  Simply spray it on, let it dry, and you're protected.

[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:43.000]  That's sprayyourplate.com.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.080]  Don't give your money to the state, spray your plate.
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:47.240]  Do you ever have one of those days
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:49.400]  where everything goes right?
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:51.760]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:55.080]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel,
[1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:57.840]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[1:28:57.840 --> 1:28:59.640]  Finalized the contract in London,
[1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:01.800]  and demoed our new product in Boston,
[1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:04.520]  online from my desk with Webex.
[1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:06.000]  Webex lets me take meetings
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.840]  and give presentations from my desk.
[1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:09.520]  I just talked to clients on the phone,
[1:29:09.520 --> 1:29:11.640]  and they watch what's happening on my desktop
[1:29:11.640 --> 1:29:13.880]  from their desktop, so I can travel the world
[1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:16.560]  and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:18.240]  Travel less, meet online.

[1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:46.160]  See a website for details.
[1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:48.320]  On September 11th, 2001,
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:50.760]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:54.080]  I went to Ground Sierra, and we knew what to do.
[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:55.320]  Or at least we thought we did.
[1:29:55.320 --> 1:29:58.120]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[1:29:58.120 --> 1:30:00.760]  that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:02.320]  to tell their story.
[1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:07.320]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement
[1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:11.240]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:14.080]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[1:30:14.080 --> 1:30:16.120]  as brave souls throughout the world
[1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:18.360]  take action against their global masters.
[1:30:18.360 --> 1:30:20.080]  He had his hand over the radio
[1:30:20.080 --> 1:30:21.520]  while he was getting a countdown.
[1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:24.280]  He takes his hand off in year three, two, one,
[1:30:24.280 --> 1:30:27.320]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:30.320]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:34.160]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:36.360]  and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[1:30:39.280 --> 1:30:41.720]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[1:30:41.720 --> 1:30:44.600]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:30:44.600 --> 1:31:05.600]  SIRIS Joe from 1810 to 1913, made his great-grandchildren believe
[1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:07.600]  you could live to 103.
[1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:14.600]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:19.600]  So SIRIS Joe's lived forever.
[1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:24.600]  Grave digger, when you dig my grave,
[1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:28.600]  would you make a shallow shore
[1:31:28.600 --> 1:31:32.600]  so I can feel the rain?
[1:31:32.600 --> 1:31:37.600]  Grave digger.
[1:31:40.600 --> 1:31:44.600]  Mural Stonewall, 1913 to 1954,
[1:31:44.600 --> 1:31:50.600]  she lost both of her babies in the Second Great War.
[1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:53.600]  Now you should never have to watch
[1:31:53.600 --> 1:31:56.600]  your own little children lower than the ground.
[1:31:56.600 --> 1:32:00.600]  You should never have to bury your own babies.
[1:32:00.600 --> 1:32:06.600]  Great digger, when you did my grave,
[1:32:06.600 --> 1:32:10.600]  Could you make a shallow swim,
[1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:15.600]  But I can feel all the rain,
[1:32:15.600 --> 1:32:18.600]  Great digger.
[1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:27.600]  Rain around the roses,
[1:32:27.600 --> 1:32:32.600]  Pocket full of food.
[1:32:32.600 --> 1:32:36.600]  Ashes, ashes.
[1:32:41.600 --> 1:32:43.600]  We all fall down.
[1:32:43.600 --> 1:32:45.600]  We're meant to communicate,
[1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:47.600]  With future generations,
[1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:49.600]  By our words and deeds,
[1:32:49.600 --> 1:32:53.600]  We're meant to build a better world,
[1:32:53.600 --> 1:32:55.600]  For our species.
[1:32:55.600 --> 1:32:57.600]  Through our species,
[1:32:57.600 --> 1:32:59.600]  We have a potential to live forever.
[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:02.600]  There is no doubt in that fact.
[1:33:06.600 --> 1:33:14.600]  Life is not the pursuit of things.
[1:33:14.600 --> 1:33:17.600]  It is the pursuit of ideas.
[1:33:17.600 --> 1:33:21.600]  And life is a test.
[1:33:21.600 --> 1:33:25.600]  A journey.
[1:33:25.600 --> 1:33:28.600]  Will you pass that test?
[1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:32.600]  Will you live a life of substance?
[1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:35.600]  A life of honor?
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:38.600]  Or will you be deceived?
[1:33:38.600 --> 1:33:41.600]  Will you be a child of the dark side?
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:45.600]  Or a child of the light?
[1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:50.600]  Will you make a shallow swim,
[1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:54.600]  But I can feel all the rain,
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:58.600]  Great digger.
[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:03.600]  Will you make a shallow swim,
[1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:08.600]  But I can feel all the rain,
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:17.600]  Great digger.
[1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:19.600]  By the way, just a tidbit,
[1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:22.600]  That anti-war rally,
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  The date is set.
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:26.600]  I got so much going on,
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:28.600]  Finishing another film with Bermas,
[1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:30.600]  And doing hundreds of other things,
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:32.600]  And doing all these radio interviews,
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:34.600]  Which I've got to start refusing to do.
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:36.600]  I just can't operate or live.
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:38.600]  And I'm not whining.
[1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:40.600]  It's just that then I don't do the best job
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:42.600]  At a lot of other things.
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:44.600]  I want to get back into Israel in 9-11 in a minute,
[1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:46.600]  But by the end of the show today,
[1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:48.600]  We're going to post on infowars.com
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:51.600]  The winner of the first wave of contest.
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:55.600]  To be clear, there's a $2,000 contest
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:57.600]  For the best censorship video
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:34:59.600]  Showing on the web is being censored.
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:01.600]  And then a 1,000 prize for the best
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:03.600]  Truth-Rising Trailer fan trailer.
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:05.600]  And I said the last day to have those in
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:07.600]  Monday, I said I'd announce it Monday.
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:09.600]  But I've been so busy, there's been so many
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:11.600]  Hundreds of entries, I can't even keep track of.
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:13.600]  And I've tried, last night for hours,
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:15.600]  I watched them. After I was here
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:17.600]  Finishing up trailers with Bermas,
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:19.600]  I went home and watched more.
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:21.600]  This morning I got up early, I was watching,
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:23.600]  Didn't even exercise, that little bit of time
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:25.600]  I have to just watch more of these.
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.600]  I've chosen the winners.
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:29.600]  Kurt's writing a little article about it right now.
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:31.600]  And it really shocked me that in the comment section
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:33.600]  It's like, Alex, what's your problem?
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  First you said it was a $5,000 prize.
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:37.600]  Now you're saying it's a $2,000 prize.
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:39.600]  What is it? No, no, no. There's two waves
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:41.600]  Of prizes.
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:43.600]  And I'm sorry we weren't properly clear about all that.
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:45.600]  There's another contest coming up the 19th.
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:47.600]  And I'm leaving town the 21st
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:49.600]  To go to Denver, so I'll have to announce
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:51.600]  On the 20th there. I just want to try
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:53.600]  To judge these properly.
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:55.600]  You know, I mean, I came up with the idea
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:57.600]  I'm giving out cash prizes, the whole
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:35:59.600]  Points to expose internet censorship.
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:01.600]  And I know I'm not perfect, man.
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:03.600]  I'm overwhelmed. I'm not perfect.
[1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:05.600]  I'm not a God. I don't have it
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:07.600]  All together.
[1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:09.600]  For our special guest that's scheduled
[1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:11.600]  To be showing up in here, you know, last night.
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:13.600]  You know who the maid is? Alex Jones.
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:15.600]  Cleared my papers off my glass desk in here.
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:17.600]  Got Windex out.
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:19.600]  Cleaned it.
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:21.600]  Cleaned the office last night.
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:23.600]  I cleaned the office while I was working on the trailer.
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:25.600]  Well, then I went home and tried to judge
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:27.600]  Your trailers and I'm not whining.
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:29.600]  Just give me a little bit of leeway.
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:31.600]  I mean, folks, I put the toilet paper
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:33.600]  On the rolls around here.
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:35.600]  I had to, you know, we were going out yesterday
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:37.600]  Because the maid service comes twice a week
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:39.600]  Here in the office, but they don't clean off my desk
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:41.600]  Because it's always a mess.
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:43.600]  I don't want to dig into my papers.
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:45.600]  But, you know, I ran out and got the plastic bags
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:47.600]  For them. We were out. I mean, I'm just an average
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:49.600]  Person, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:51.600]  People expect so much of us.
[1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:53.600]  You expect that I'm some superhero
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:55.600]  And I'm not, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:36:57.600]  I don't mean to get off on a diatribe.
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:07.600]  I am exhausted sometimes.
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:09.600]  It's just, there's so much.
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:11.600]  Trying to administrate just 15 employees
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:13.600]  Is a nightmare.
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:15.600]  And I'm not whining.
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:17.600]  I'm just saying, I remember
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:19.600]  When before I knew Hollywood people
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:21.600]  And music stars and politicians, I thought they were like gods
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:23.600]  And floated around on cloud nine
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:25.600]  And we're superhuman.
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:27.600]  Now that I know a lot of these people over the last
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:29.600]  Six, seven, eight years, I know that's not the case.
[1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:31.600]  Now that I run a business
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:33.600]  Now that I deal with all this, I understand, folks
[1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:35.600]  How hard life is.
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:37.600]  And I think for a lot of you out there
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:39.600]  Who work nine to fives, you have no idea what it's like
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:41.600]  To be in an administrative position.
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:43.600]  And you have no idea. I mean, and I don't claim
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:45.600]  To be good at all this. We turn out the most
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:47.600]  Films, the most videos, the most radio shows
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:49.600]  Were the most innovative in this movement
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:57.600]  And that isn't saying much.
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:59.600]  That is not saying much.
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:01.600]  And I'm exhilarated with all that's happening in the world.
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:03.600]  But this whole Russia sneak attack thing
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:05.600]  With the Georgian sneak attacking them
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:07.600]  U.S. backed has exhausted me covering that.
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:09.600]  I probably added two, three hours of research today
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:11.600]  To my five, six, seven hours of research
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:13.600]  On top of everything.
[1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:15.600]  I mean, sleep misses out.
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:17.600]  I literally am so alive
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:19.600]  Fighting so hard
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:21.600]  That I do not get sleep.
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:23.600]  And I just get
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:25.600]  Enraged with frustration
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:27.600]  When people expect
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:29.600]  The impossible for me.
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:31.600]  Do this, do that, do a better job here
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:33.600]  Do a better job there.
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.600]  It's the same thing.
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:37.600]  We cover corruption in every group
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:39.600]  China, Russia, every religious group
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:41.600]  The Vatican, Muslims, Protestant groups
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:43.600]  We cover corruption in every group
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:45.600]  China, Russia, every religious group
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:47.600]  Muslims, Protestant groups
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  We cover it all, but we don't hone in
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:51.600]  And focus in on only one group.
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:53.600]  We focus the corruption
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:55.600]  That is in humanity, the good, the bad
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  And the ugly. Every group does evil.
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:38:59.600]  Every group does bad. And because I say that
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:01.600]  And because I won't say
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:03.600]  The center of all evil is in Israel
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.600]  The center of all evil is in
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:07.600]  The Vatican or the center of all evil
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:09.600]  Is the evil whitey or the evil
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:11.600]  Black person, you know, all these groups
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:13.600]  Say it's always one group
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:15.600]  And are some groups more dominant
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:17.600]  Than others? Have some groups been more successful
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:19.600]  At evil and oppression? Yes.
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:21.600]  But does that mean that
[1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:23.600]  One group needs to be singled out
[1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:25.600]  As a source of all evil? No.
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:27.600]  Conversely though
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:29.600]  On the subject of Israel
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:31.600]  It is one of the most wicked nations on earth
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:33.600]  I'd have to say North Korea
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:35.600]  The US, Mexico, England
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:37.600]  Saudi Arabia
[1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:41.600]  Those are some of the most wicked
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:43.600]  Countries on earth
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:49.600]  I'm not against Mexicans
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:51.600]  I'm not against British
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:53.600]  I'm not against Chinese. I'm not against
[1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:55.600]  I'm against corruption and
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:39:59.600]  For me to make
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:05.600]  Road to tyranny, masters of terror
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:07.600]  Martial law
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:09.600]  Terror storm
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:11.600]  All with large sections
[1:40:11.600 --> 1:40:13.600]  On Israel sponsored terror
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:15.600]  Where the Jerusalem Post
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:17.600]  Harats, others admit they staged terror attacks
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:19.600]  Created fake al-Qaeda groups
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:21.600]  Created
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:23.600]  Hamas
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:25.600]  I just show it
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:27.600]  I showed it when Israel warned
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:29.600]  Their people to get out of the building
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:31.600]  It was in Israeli papers. I did cover all that
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:33.600]  I just have not
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:35.600]  Made it
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:37.600]  My sole complete
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:39.600]  My sole mission
[1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:41.600]  To only sit there and cover that
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:45.600]  The most incredible thing is
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:47.600]  Every time I talk about Israel
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:49.600]  And the corruption and the evil
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:51.600]  And the things that that government's doing
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  People take clips of the radio show
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:55.600]  And put it on YouTube and the web and say
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:57.600]  Oh, this was Alex behind the scenes
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:40:59.600]  Alex was caught off guard
[1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:01.600]  This isn't his radio show
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:03.600]  This is him secretly behind the scenes
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:05.600]  Admitting he knows all this
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:07.600]  He's been corrupt
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:09.600]  That is so deceptive
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:11.600]  And the same thing with the most deceptive
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:13.600]  I've found are the Catholics running
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:15.600]  All crowd. Not that the Catholic church isn't
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  Corrupt and calling for a new old order and doing all these bad things
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:19.600]  But I'm not going to bash Catholics individually
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:21.600]  I'm going to say, yeah, the Pope's calling for a world government
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:23.600]  And saying all religions are equal
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:25.600]  And then I have countless guests on
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:27.600]  Over the years and my detractors just lie
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:29.600]  And say that I've never talked about it
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:31.600]  Or never covered it or never
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:33.600]  Never
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:35.600]  Never
[1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:37.600]  I mean, I've done whole weeks where I do
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:39.600]  Two, three shows in a row on things like that
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:41.600]  And they'll just say, no, you haven't
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:45.600]  And there is a whole industry out there
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:47.600]  Of how Alex Jones is bad
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:55.600]  And a lot of it's self-righteousness
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:57.600]  Maybe people out there knew more than I did
[1:41:57.600 --> 1:41:59.600]  About a particular group or organization
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:01.600]  I'm a generalist in knowledge
[1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:03.600]  And I've gotten more courage
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:05.600]  And I'm a genuine real person
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:07.600]  And I don't like hurting people's feelings
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:09.600]  And I don't like attacking groups
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  And I don't enjoy it
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:13.600]  And so I'm forced to do this
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:15.600]  I'm forced to put myself in danger
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:17.600]  And cover these things
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:21.600]  You know, I come out and the first big show
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:23.600]  To expose that Israel basically
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:25.600]  Ran much of the agenda in Georgia
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:27.600]  As their defense minister being in Israeli
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:29.600]  Their foreign minister, many others
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:31.600]  On the web and people say, oh, you piece of crap
[1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:33.600]  You know, you're covering up for Israel
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:35.600]  What the hell are you talking about?
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:41.600]  I mean, I remember losing radio stations
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:43.600]  One of them was the lion
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:45.600]  A big station, a 10,000 watts
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:47.600]  Covering about half of Colorado
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:49.600]  Been on there a couple years, huge audience
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:51.600]  And they called me up and they said
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:53.600]  You're criticizing Israel, we're taking you off
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:55.600]  Unless you stop and I just said
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:42:57.600]  Well, please, please, you know
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:42:59.600]  There's been a lot of complaints
[1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:01.600]  I said, well, I can't stop
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:03.600]  I mean, I've got to talk about some of this
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:05.600]  I don't hate Israel or Jews
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:07.600]  I mean, I'm just here covering what Israel's doing
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:09.600]  They said, that's it, you're off
[1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:11.600]  And then a couple other stations took me off
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:13.600]  I mean, I lose radio stations
[1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:15.600]  Five years ago, three, four years ago
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:17.600]  To tell the truth here on this show
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:19.600]  I take the hard stances
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:21.600]  I make a film about Israel attacking the USS Liberty
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:23.600]  Now declassified, I've been totally vindicated
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:25.600]  Because I interviewed the chairman, she's a staff
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:27.600]  I mean, I brought you the classified info
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:29.600]  Now it's been declassified
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:31.600]  I got death threats over that
[1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:33.600]  And then I get from the other side
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:35.600]  That I'm covering up
[1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:39.600]  All because I knew that one of the people
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:41.600]  In the hate the Jews movement
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:43.600]  Was a convicted felon
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:45.600]  And involved in all this intelligence
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:47.600]  And involved in all this corruption
[1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:49.600]  And I knew about his criminal record
[1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:51.600]  So I would never interview the guy
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:53.600]  So he comes out and tells all these lies about me
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:55.600]  That I'm successful
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:43:57.600]  And then I have millions of listeners and they don't
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:43:59.600]  And I'm successful because I'm genuine
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:01.600]  And there's people out there that have discernment
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:03.600]  And they know I'm genuine
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:05.600]  And they've watched everything I talk about come true
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:07.600]  And they've seen me be attacked from every angle and every side
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  This New World Order is hurting Mexicans
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:13.600]  It's hurting Canadians
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:15.600]  It's hurting people in the US
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:17.600]  It's hurting Germans, it's hurting Jews
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:19.600]  It's hurting Israelis, it's hurting Chinese
[1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:21.600]  It's hurting Japanese, it's hurting Russians
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:23.600]  It's hurting Laotians
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:25.600]  It's hurting Nuits
[1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:27.600]  That's Eskimos for those in the public school education system
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:29.600]  I know the New World Order is hurting people
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:33.600]  I know the New World Order is doing bad things
[1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:35.600]  I know they're federalizing and taking over
[1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:37.600]  I know they're ignoring the states and the legislatures
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:39.600]  I know they're building FEMA camps and told you about it
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:41.600]  A decade before it was in the Houston Chronicle
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:43.600]  And the San Francisco Chronicle
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:45.600]  And the Chicago Tribune
[1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:49.600]  And we have really stepped out folks
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:51.600]  With these fabled enemies
[1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:53.600]  And what do we get?
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:55.600]  Do we get thank you for taking a bold stance?
[1:44:55.600 --> 1:44:57.600]  Do we get thank you for doing this?
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:44:59.600]  Do we get man, this is really
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:01.600]  Hardcore what you're doing
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:03.600]  For somebody as prominent as you know
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:05.600]  We get you piece of crap
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:07.600]  You're a piece of crap
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:09.600]  Let me tell those people something
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:11.600]  You're not going to grow your movements
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:13.600]  And you're not going to reach more people
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:15.600]  If you can't ever have
[1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:17.600]  Anyone
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:19.600]  Ever come even a degree
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:21.600]  Towards your point of view without attacking them
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:23.600]  You're in this for the wrong reason
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:25.600]  You're not in this to fight corruption
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:27.600]  And wake people up and bring people together
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:29.600]  And expose government sponsored terror
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:31.600]  You're here on an egomaniac trip
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:33.600]  On a personal power trip
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:37.600]  If you were genuine
[1:45:37.600 --> 1:45:39.600]  And did this stuff for the right reasons
[1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:41.600]  You would then become
[1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:43.600]  The leaders you wanted to be
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:45.600]  Me
[1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:47.600]  I never had a rhyme a reason
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:49.600]  A formula I just did what my heart told me
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:51.600]  What my intellect told me and I did what was right
[1:45:51.600 --> 1:45:53.600]  And I did what my spirit told me
[1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:57.600]  And that is what I continue to do
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:45:59.600]  Boldly through the hell
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:01.600]  I have gone through things I won't even say on air
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:03.600]  It is unbelievable
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:05.600]  The fires I've gone through but every time
[1:46:05.600 --> 1:46:07.600]  God has rewarded me and every time
[1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:09.600]  Things have gotten better afterwards that I go through the fire
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:11.600]  And just totally commit to fighting tyranny
[1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:13.600]  And I go down a very dark road
[1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:15.600]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:17.600]  But I know that there is an end to this
[1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:19.600]  The only way out is by facing it
[1:46:19.600 --> 1:46:21.600]  And fighting it and being bold
[1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:23.600]  And telling the truth
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:25.600]  And I will not engage
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:27.600]  In tribalism and in fighting
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:29.600]  And focusing in
[1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:31.600]  And demonizing one group
[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:33.600]  No matter how racist or horrible
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:35.600]  That group's leadership may be
[1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:37.600]  I will not lower myself
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:39.600]  To the level of Raza and Mecha
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:41.600]  Who openly talk about killing the gringo
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:43.600]  And the plan of San Diego and all this incredible stuff
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:45.600]  I will simply try to lovingly
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:47.600]  But forcefully
[1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:49.600]  Wake up all Americans
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:51.600]  To come together and realize the globalists
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:53.600]  Want us to fight each other
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:55.600]  Want us to kill each other
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:46:57.600]  In fact, cue up top ranking
[1:46:57.600 --> 1:46:59.600]  Bob Marley
[1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:01.600]  I want to play this when we come back
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:03.600]  Because I think the song says it all
[1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:05.600]  And yes, I know they were black nationalists
[1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:07.600]  And
[1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:09.600]  You know, thought that
[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:13.600]  The source of evil was whitey
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:15.600]  But it didn't matter, the song's spirit is right
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:17.600]  And
[1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:19.600]  They were talking about blacks killing each other
[1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:21.600]  Well, we all need to stop killing each other
[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:23.600]  We all need to stop fighting with each other
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:25.600]  That doesn't mean we don't expose the evil leadership
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:27.600]  But when you attack a whole people
[1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:29.600]  Because of their leadership
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:31.600]  Then the population
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:33.600]  Goes up, going under the wing of their leadership
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:35.600]  More and supporting them
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:37.600]  You know, I've made the mistake on air
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:39.600]  Just bashing police frothing
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:41.600]  Because of their brutality and corruption
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:43.600]  And how they haven't been in many cities
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:45.600]  And areas accountable
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:47.600]  I end up bashing police at a primitive level
[1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:49.600]  I'm primitive
[1:47:49.600 --> 1:47:51.600]  Then that makes them compact more into their gang mentality
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:53.600]  Into their thin blue line
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:55.600]  Us against them that they talk about
[1:47:55.600 --> 1:47:57.600]  Instead of reaching out to them as humans
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:47:59.600]  And showing them how they're being manipulated
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:01.600]  How they're being federalized, how they're being controlled
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:03.600]  And when I finally do that, the police open up
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:05.600]  And want to understand the truth
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:07.600]  What? Does it mean I'm perfect? No
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:09.600]  I've done a lot of damage with relations between the citizens
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:11.600]  And the police
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.600]  They've done a lot of damage too
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:15.600]  But I've got to get the beam out of my eye
[1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:17.600]  Before I get the beam out of there
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:19.600]  We've got to be statesmen here about this
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:21.600]  And I'm trying to grow into that statesman
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:23.600]  Because of the incredible responsibility I have
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:25.600]  As the de facto leader of the resistance
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:27.600]  And that's who I am
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:29.600]  I'm going to get that and step into those shoes
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:31.600]  And it's upsetting
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:33.600]  There isn't a thrill of exhilaration there
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:35.600]  There's a great weight in that
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:37.600]  We're going to come back with top ranking for all of us
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:39.600]  To come together
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:49:07.600]  This is Genesis
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:09.600]  The old America has made great progress
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:11.600]  For the world
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:13.600]  Most people have no idea they're not after money
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:15.600]  They have all the money they need

[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:35.600]  They don't want to see us here
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:37.600]  They don't want to see us unite
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:43.600]  All they want us to do is
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:47.600]  Keep on pushing and fighting
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:51.600]  They don't want to see us live together
[1:49:55.600 --> 1:49:57.600]  All they want us to do is
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:49:59.600]  Keep on killing one another
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:02.200]  Keep on killin' one another
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:08.600]  Top Rankin', Top Rankin'
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:16.000]  Oh you skeleton, oh you skeleton
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:22.800]  Oh you top rankin', oh did you mean what you said?
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:28.000]  Oh you, oh you, oh you
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  They say the blood runs, and it runs through our lion
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  Under heart, heart of heart of land
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  And John saw them come
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  Oh with the truth come an ancient turn
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  The brotherly love, the sisterly love
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  I feel this morning, I feel this morning
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  Brotherly love, the sisterly love
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  I feel this morning, this morning
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  They don't want us to unite
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  All they want, all they want us to do is
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  Keep on fustin' and fighting
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  They don't want to see us live together
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  All they want us to do is
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  Keep on killin' one another
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  Top Rankin', Top Rankin'
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  Did you mean what you said?
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  Oh you skeleton, oh you skeleton
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  Top Rankin', Top Rankin'
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  Did you mean what you said?
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  Oh you, oh you, oh you
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  Top Rankin', Top Rankin'
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  All of those that attack me, that attack liberty, that attack freedom, that attack innocence, you're on the losing side of history.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  And that goes for people in the new order system, people in our own movement that are fighting the new order for the wrong reasons.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  It's time for wisdom, it's time for gut checks, it's time for all of us to self analyze ourselves and ask ourselves why we're doing what we're doing.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  And to ask ourselves if we are twisting, twisting ourselves, twisting our motivations, why are you in this movement, why are you doing what you're doing?
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  Why won't you lie about somebody and attack somebody to you, never admit you're wrong, and then just add to that delusion?
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  This radio show explodes by the day, the websites explode by the day, our information just grows exponentially.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  There are infowars.com bumper stickers, there are groups and organizations, just with the touchstone of this radio show worldwide, tens of millions.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  And I'm only one person in this fight. There are tens of thousands of prominent people, lovely, wonderful people of every race, color, and creed.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  There are Chinese, there are Latin Americans, there are Germans, there are Jews, there are Brits, there are Scots, there are Irish, there are Africans, there are Indians, there are Native Americans.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  All of us together want our children to go up free and safe, and only liberty can deliver a hope of that. Stay with us.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  The government has not told the truth. In five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  I don't expect people in the liberty movement, the awakening movement, the pro-freedom movement, whatever you want to call it,
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  to agree with everything I say and do and all of my guests.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  Because sometimes in hindsight, I don't agree with the things I've done or said.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  But I do expect you to assess what you're doing.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  I'm not talking about people even attacking me, but people that just spend their time attacking other people in the liberty movement.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  And self-policing and believing you'll become the leader of something if you continue that.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  No, you're wasting away. You're destroying yourself. I want you to be leaders. We need you.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  We need you to be focused and wise. We need all of you.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  Then you're gut. You know I'm for real. You know I love you and I care about you.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  Folks, the sodium fluoride. You can spend all day saying I'm mad and evil, but at least spend some of your time.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  Warning people that sodium fluoride is killing people, attacking all the glands, all the organs, thousands of studies.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  I told people a year ago when they first approved it, that it had already killed a bunch of people in trials
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  and caused thousands of autoimmune diseases that are crippling people.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  And I had guest in studio medical doctors.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  And now a year plus later, the death toll is much higher. And this is a whitewash number you're about to hear.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  Why aren't you warning women to not give them the Gardasil shot that's a live cancer virus that doesn't even protect them?
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  And that actually hurts them. It says it on the insert.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  In fact, here's CNN. Listen to this.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  Tequeria Williams doesn't get to act like a kid anymore. She's just too tired.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  But Tequeria's mother says everything changed last December after her daughter received Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents 70% of cervical cancer.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  She's never been sick. She's never been in a hospital. Nothing. Until the Gardasil shot.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Two months after getting the shot, Tequeria says she got a rash on her face and arms, leaving these scars.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  She had swelling all over, pain in her joints, and poor circulation in her fingertips.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  Her doctor told us she now suffers from an autoimmune disease and says it is possible the Gardasil triggered her illness.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  Though she made it clear the cause cannot be proven.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  According to a federal tracking system called VAERS.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  Stop that. Stop that. We're going to play the death toll in a minute.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  The drug, the live cancer virus, they admit that's what it does. They admit that's one of the quote side effects.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  And we've had medical doctors on who documented that is what's happening in the trials it did then.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  We didn't tell you a year ago it made your hair fall out. We told you it causes autoimmune diseases which cripple you or kills you.
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  And then now you're in the news, you're later admitting that.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  And so they go to some doctor who hasn't done the epidemiological test and they're saying, well, I can't prove it, but it looks like it's connected.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  Well, the studies do prove that just like we played you clips of all the troops dying after they get vaccines and the feds won't even say what the secret vaccine was.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  It's illegal. Federal courts have ruled they can't even make the military take shots.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  But they tell the troops they have to. Finish it up with the death toll.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  According to a federal tracking system called VAERS, there have been 9,749 adverse reactions following the vaccination.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  And 21 reported deaths since 2006.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  I chose to get my daughter vaccinated.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  But Merck, Gardasil's maker, points out these are anecdotal cases.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  Let's stop. As we told you a year ago, Merck knew that it was causing these problems just like their Vioxx caused all the heart attacks and the rest of it.
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:51.000]  And so they had Governor Perry, who they paid, quote, make it mandatory, which it really wasn't, quote, recommended.
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  So then federal vaccine damage fund kicked in and federal liability payments kicked in to pay for the damage.
[1:59:57.000 --> 2:00:01.000]  Then they got it approved to roll out knowing what it would do.
[2:00:01.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  Just like Bayer Pharmacological knew that millions of people who get HIV and hepatitis from their factor 8, they knew every injection of the blood product over a decade would give a death sentence to who took it.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  And that's all come out mainstream news.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  See, those are the issues that people better be talking about.
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  I've got to say, I've seen a few of my detractors actually do that. I commend you.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  That's good. Spend some time helping people.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  We've got the most well researched and documented titles.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.

[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  I'll go ahead and tell you who our surprise guest is today. They called us about 20 minutes ago and said he was running late.
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  Hope I get my full 30 minutes with him.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  That's the Austin Police Chief, Art Acevedo, and he will be reportedly joining us here in the next 10 minutes or so.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  I may have to play some clips while we get him into the chair. These guys always have very busy schedules.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  And they know who we are and said they'd be happy to come on the show about two weeks ago.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  They set this date up and they say he's coming over here to our little South Austin office.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  So I am here waiting for that to happen.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  I bet he'll have an entourage too.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  I've got quite a few questions for the police chief.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  I have to say that he's been the first police chief we've had in decades who, when police shoot people on the back, he kicks them off the force.
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  And it's not because he doesn't like the police, it's because he knows.
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  I'm going to ask him about this, but that's what other police chiefs have said they'd be doing the right thing.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  Because then it makes all the police look bad and then destroys their image and destroys their effectiveness in the community.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  But we'll talk about that with him, a lot of other things.
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  With the Austin police chief who is scheduled to be joining us in studio.
[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  I've had a lot of police are listening. I know they always listen anyways.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  I've walked by squad cars before, years ago when my show be rebroadcasting, you know, in a several parking lot in here, I'm listening to it.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  I'll never forget.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  One time, George Bush, it was in 2002, he had the federal marshals guarding his daughters.
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  And it was my friend's 40th birthday, his wife's 40th birthday.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  It was actually Kevin Booth, Trey Booth, his wife.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  We went to a steakhouse downtown and I come walking up, there's all these black suburbans, they go, oh, Alex Jones.
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  Oh, my God, don't, Alex, just leave him alone. I'm not going to say who's in there.
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  I'm like, that's fine. Okay, we're fans of the show.
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:13.000]  He goes, look, and the federal marshals in the car, another one with the local FM that was rebroadcasting my show on, listening to it.
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  And then I go in to the steakhouse and they happen to see us in this huge steakhouse.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  Well, it's pretty big city grill, several big rooms.
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  Right next to the Bush daughters, who were getting completely drunk, this is after they turned 21, they just turned 21, or twins.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  And they're in there with their punk rock boyfriends, the devil tats and, you know, pentagram shirts, literally.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  And Kevin goes, I've got a video camera in my car, let's get video of this, it'll be huge.
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  And I said, do not even think about it.
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  It went into American media, the inquire that a piece on them, they got anthrax mail to them.
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  And I literally had to reach over and get Kevin by the arm and I said, no.
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  Oh, they're here.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  Are they already in the building? Hey, it's the police chief smiling at me through the window.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  Well, you know what, go to that piece we were going to play, so I have time to get the police chief in here and greet him.
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  Go ahead and go to that, John. We'll be back in three minutes.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  We know the air is unfit to breathe, our food is unfit to eat.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides of 63 violent crimes,
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is please at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-built and radios and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone. I want you to get mad.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to ride. I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  All I know is that first you've got to get mad. You've got to say I'm a human being. My life has value.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  I want you to get up now.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it and stick your head out and yell.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  I want you to get up right now. Get up, go to the windows, open them and stick your head out and yell.
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  The relationship between Bin Laden and the CIA was essentially, he was one of the assets.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  One of the people they could turn to, they wanted something done, they wanted Bin Laden.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  In the early 1980s, Bin Laden worked with operatives from US intelligence, the Pakistani military and Arab states.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  Is it not true that the United States government paid $300 million to the Bin Laden family for the construction of the military camps?
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  At basis though, I really think that these were more CIA assets, people that were recruited, like all of the folks I've been issuing visas to.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  At the evidence that there were foreign governments involved, most of that information is classified, I think overly classified.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  Osama Bin Laden.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  Remember 24 hours ago, it was the Bush tax cut, the Bush budget, the Bush economy.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  Live in 30 seconds.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  You don't hear of any of that tonight. It's America's enemy, America's under attack.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  You're live.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I am really excited and he's a really nice guy.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  I guess that's why he's already a major police chief and a major city as young as he is.
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  And he's got a long bio here, but I thought that he was, for the rest of the hour, being very gracious about that.
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  Art Ausilvedo, he is the Austin police chief who's now been in what, close to a year or so.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  A little over. A little over a year.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  And we're honored to have you, sir.
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  Good to be here. Finally get to meet you.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  Well, it's great to have you in studio with us today.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  Just out of the gates, instead of reading your lengthy bio, tell us a little bit about yourself because this is an international audience, obviously, not just in Austin.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Okay, well, I'm 44 years old. I'm a proud father of three kids.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  A 19 year old, 16 year old and a four month old.
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  I was born in Havana, Cuba. I've migrated to the United States.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  One of the lucky ones that got out of Cuba in 68.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  I always wanted to be a cop, became a cop, loved being a cop.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  And I did it out of a desire to really serve.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  I love people. I think being a cop is really about dealing with people.
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  And if you can deal with people, you have people skills, you can be very successful at policing.
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  Now, obviously, you've got courage coming into the lion's den here.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  Well, hey, I frisked you down. I don't see any weapons on you.
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  So, you know, words can't kill you. I hope.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  No, no, listen, listen, we've always wanted a relationship with the police.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  Yeah.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  And, you know, I don't like the fact, and I've probably even been bad in the past bashing police too much.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  And that kind of compacts police into their own little culture.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  Right.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  Instead of having the public and the police interface. And I know that since you've gotten in,
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  you've done a lot of things I've actually really agreed with some things I've disagreed with
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  and really have been interfacing with the media, the public.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  I mean, you've got to be the hardest working police chief I've ever seen living in Austin for the last 18 years.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  Well, great. Well, thank you for that. And what do you know, it's important.
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  Look, we have nothing to hide. I really believe that through transparency comes trust.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  And the more transparent we are, the more we engage the community.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  Sometimes we're going to have to agree to disagree, but, and that's okay.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  But we have to have a dialogue because that's what's going to breed trust.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  And with trust, I think come safety and a better quality of life for all of us.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  Now, chief, I got a lot of questions here.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  Okay, I'll bow the answer.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  Out of the gates, though, tell us about your philosophy before we go to this break in just a moment.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  Your philosophy versus some of your predecessors.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  Well, my philosophy, I think is transparency and accountability are the two most important things to me.
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  If we're transparent, I really believe we have a pretty darn good department.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  So why not be transparent?
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  And why not put the good, the bad and the ugly out there?
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  Because by doing that, people start realizing that we have nothing to hide and they can actually trust us.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  And I think in the past, we really haven't engaged as an organization, the community, the media, your critics.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  Some people run away from activists.
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  I actually run towards them because I want to know what they have to say.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  And I want them to know what I feel, what I believe, so at least we can have that mutual respect.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  Well, there have been big changes.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  Also, in the past, if Austin police shot somebody in the back, they would not get in trouble.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  Now, they have been getting in trouble.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  Well, you know, you're talking about the Kevin Brown shooting.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  That was a tragic event for everybody involved, including the sergeant was fired.
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  But the reality is, we've got to call them as we see them.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  You know, I know the community likes some of the calls.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  They'll dislike some of the calls.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  But I think if people know your heart and they know that you actually care and that you're trying to do the right thing,
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  they may not agree with you, but at least they'll respect the fact that you're trying and that your heart's in the right place, which is important.
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  Well, absolutely.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  And you've done some other things that have been good.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  And I've been happy to see police and the union not attacking you as much because they understand that if they don't clean house, it's just going to be downhill.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  You know, and that's true.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  The reality is, we don't have that much cleaning to do with.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  The majority of our cops are really hardworking, dedicated professionals.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  But it doesn't take more than one or two or three or a handful to really diminish the excellence and destroy the excellence in the bridges that we're building.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  I'll tell you what, we're going to break.
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  That's a great place to leave it off.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  Stay there, sir.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  Back in just a few minutes with the Austin Police Chief in studio with us.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  All right.
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  Or at least we thought we did.
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  When one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned, he says,
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  wow, have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  And I said, oh, of course.
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  Whoo, they're high.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  He says, yeah, he says, what am I going to do?
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  I've got a truck.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  I really need the truck for my job.
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  I don't know what to do.
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  I said, Bob, relax.
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  I know what to do.
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  Call efoodsdirect.com or go up on the web at efoodsdirect.com.

[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  He said, efoodsdirect.com.
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  I said, yep, call them at 1-800-409-5633.

[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  How long does it last?
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  Three days?
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  A week?
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  Two weeks?
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  Life change tea eliminates chemicals, toxins, and parasites and much more.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  The effect?
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  You lose weight.
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  That's right.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  You lose weight.
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  So here's the story.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  You wash your car.
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  It gets dirty again.
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  You cleanse your body.
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  Chemicals and toxins come back.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  The fix?
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  Stay on the tee.

[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  Get the tee.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  Restoring America's health one teabag at a time.
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo is our guest in studio.
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  And now we can start the interrogation.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  Here we go.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  You like the interrogation room?
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  We have lots of lights, a little bit of room.
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  I like the padding, you know, so when you get rough with me, I know I'm not going to hurt myself too badly.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  You know, I'm surprised that you didn't bring a whole entourage with you.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  Because other Austin Police Chiefs I've noticed would normally have an entourage.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  And then guys out in the parking lot, I've worked at a few of the radio stations doing my show out of there.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  And the police chiefs would be coming on other shows sometimes.
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  And you'd see guys in the parking lot looking around.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  No, I'm a one-man traveling show.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  I brought Anna Saban, she's our public information manager, and I think that it's important for her to meet the folks out here in the media so you can have a relationship with our office.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  Okay, let's get into the tough questions in this short segment.
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  We've got a long one coming up after the next break.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  Okay.
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  Plate scanning.
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  They've announced all over the country the feds have put in these license plate reading cameras.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  Police cars are getting them.
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  It's all part of this larger Northcom grid.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  You have the emergency management centers where they're bringing in the National Guard, threat assessment, threat matrix systems.
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  This whole Northcom grid.
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  The last police chief actually interviewed in person was the police chief of San Antonio, LA Philippus, when Delta Force tried to bribe him and ended up in the paper to run covert operations in the city.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:19.000]  Your take on all that?
[2:20:19.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  Well, I think any technology, it's not the technology that is bad or evil or anything else.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  It's how you use it.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  License plate readers are a good tool when you're looking for, on an amber alert, a partial plate on a kid that's been kidnapped.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  You can actually program that system, let's say it's one, two, three, S-A-M, and all you have is one, two, three, and it'll spit out any car.
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  It'll identify, here's a car that you're looking for.
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  So it helps us in terms of finding wanted vehicles and recovering stolen cars.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  With that said, if we bring it here, it's solely for our local law enforcement use and nothing else.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  But those grids, those grants are paid for by the feds.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  And if you'd like to give me documents, I can, they're also feeding into that with NSA technology.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  Well, I'm not aware of that.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  Okay, well what about the gunshot detectors they started putting up in 1998, which are really microphones?
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  Gunshot detectors, we don't have them here.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  We're very fortunate that we have a city that's a very safe city.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  What about the grants that announced in 1998 that were putting them in in East Austin?
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  We don't have them here.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  I mean, if we have them, I haven't seen them or heard about them.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  Such news to me.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  Well, those are federally put in, so I guess it's for the fed boys.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  Yeah, the Austin Police Department does not have that technology here.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  What about manualization?
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  I'm always hearing about our police being sent to Israel or Israel coming over here,
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  our police being sent to Japan, to Tokyo, and then their officers can come over here and pick people up.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  We can go over there.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  What's going on with that?
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  Well, what these are, some of those programs, actually exchange programs,
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  where you actually go and look at some of their tactics in terms of security.
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  I actually went on one myself where basically it was a tour of their facilities
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  and just to learn from their experiences in terms of terrorism and things of that nature.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  But we have not had any delegation here that I'm aware of.
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  Okay.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  I've got a film I made six years ago, so you may not be aware of the specifics of what I'm talking about,
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  but I'm sure you are.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  The programs where the Austin Police enrolled the children with the $200 discount credit card
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  and they get the $200 for turning people in, reporting on drugs, crime,
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  but they also tell them to go home and what's in the medicine cabinet.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  That sounds like East Germany.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  Are you aware of that Austin program?
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  I don't think we have that program anymore.
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  If you do, you need to let me know where it's happening because I can tell you that we're not in that business.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  But you were aware of that program.
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  I mean, this was years ago here, but I'm told it's still going on.
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  No.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  If it's going on, somebody needs to tell me where and when so I can look into that.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  I would not be in favor of a program of that sort.
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  What I'm going to do is we're going to go over this interview and in a few months,
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  I know you're a busy man.
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  I'd like to have you back in.
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  And I will have all the documents on each issue and I will play the video of the Austin TV ad
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  that they show inside the schools where it told the kids, you know,
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  you're going to get $200 for wherever you turn in.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  You're going to report on people.
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  And then they have the children write essays about what's going on in their home life.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  Like I said, what happened back then, I can't attest to.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  What I can tell you that we don't have a program like that today.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  And I would not be in favor of a program.
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  Well, good.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  I like you even more.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  What about federalization?
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  We have all this federal funds, unfunded mandates coming in, some funded,
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  with the case of the blood taking.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  Now, I know here your...
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  You're talking about my phlebotomy program that I talked about recently?
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  Well, they're taking blood at checkpoints or dragging people off to have their blood taken.
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  No.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  What's happened...
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  That's one of the reasons I'm here because I think it's really important.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  We are in one of the worst states in the Union from drunk driving.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  Drunk driving is something that I brought some of the stats where, you know,
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:55.000]  40,000 plus Americans every year are getting killed in this country.
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  Nearly 2,000 Texans are getting killed from drunk driving.
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  You can have them.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  I'm just going to show people the camera.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  And the reality is, it is carnage.
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:09.000]  What's happened, Alex, that a lot of folks, they refuse a blood test,
[2:24:09.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  okay, that we need to get that evidence.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  A lot of hospitals don't want to get...
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  Take the blood for the department without a consent from the suspect
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  because they don't want the liability.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  The Travis County Sheriff's Department is now talking to us that their nurses
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  aren't going to draw blood for us anymore.
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  They don't want their nurses to have to go to court and be tied up.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  So what's happened is we've got to look at how can we get evidence
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  that we need of a crime that's been committed.
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  Hey, leave it there.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  We'll come right back to you and let you continue.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  We have the Austin Police Chief on.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  It's amazing.
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  We're really happy to have him here.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  Stay with us.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  We're on the march.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  Now from the makers of Loose Change,

[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  in which family members receive answers to their questions
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel,
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  and today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney,
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  finalized the contract in London,
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  and demoed our new product in Boston,

[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth,
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  with free shipping to the U.S. and Canada.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storeable food.

[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  Art Acevedo, Austin Police Chief, is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  Very charming devil, I have to say.
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  We're watching him very closely from this time forward.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  I think the feeling is mutual.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  You're a teddy bear in person. I like watching you.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  I am a nice guy.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  You are a nice guy.
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  I get intimidated by police that have been given federally-paid for Darth Vader uniforms
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  that aren't wearing badges.
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  You were talking earlier about seeing video of me on the web or TV or something
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  where I'm going up to the police downtown and we're in their riot gear
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  and I'm just wanting to see their badges.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  That's why I was talking to them.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  Let me tell you something about our badges that I think you'll probably like.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  Don't look at mine, mine's unique.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  I'm the police chief.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  If you can't figure out who I am, we're in trouble.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  Our badges now have the...
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  You know how you ask, hey, do you have your badge number?
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  Oh, it says chief.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  Well, mine does.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  But you know how you always say in the movies, hey, copper, I want your badge number.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  Well, our employee numbers and our badge numbers were completely different,
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  so it didn't mean anything.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  Now, with this new badge that we have,
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  the employee number and the badge number will be one and the same.
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  No, you're really changing things.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:12.000]  I mean, now they're wearing the old-fashioned, nice, fancy, respectable uniforms,
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  not like goon outfits, and they're driving black and whites,
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  and you've got their badge numbers and a big badge.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  And a big badge.
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  So there's no doubt, and it's not a generic badge,
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  and you know what, we've got some good police officers.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  They deserve better, and I think they deserve...
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  They earn this privilege because wearing this uniform, wearing this badge,
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  is a privilege that they have to earn every day they come to work,
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  and I think they've earned a privilege of wearing a unique symbol.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  Yeah, why have a lot of departments the last 20 years gone into these maintenance uniforms?
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  It looks like the maintenance guy at a university.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  Because you know what, people are looking for comfort,
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  and we try to be the nice guy,
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  and if they want to be in their...
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  We're kind of going in the opposite direction,
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  and we're trying to tighten it up a little bit,
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  where we want people looking professional.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  We're going to have some pants that are kind of like cargo pants,
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  but they're more tailored, and they look cleaner for our guys out in patrol,
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  and we want some uniformity.
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:01.000]  So when you see an awesome police officer, they all look the same.
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  And in the past, we had white cars with a blue stripe.
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  Now you're going to the old black and white.
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  Black and white.
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  You know, there's a lot of white cars in this town.
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  Everybody drives a white car.
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:10.000]  No, they stand out now, you know.
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  Yeah, and you know, and the lights are very bright.
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  And I want our citizens to know, when they see a black and white,
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:17.000]  that that's a police car.
[2:30:17.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  It's an Austin police car, and they're out there taking care of them.
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  All right, going back to the blood issue.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:22.000]  Yeah.
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  I mean, you guys can say,
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  well, this is nothing new.
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:26.000]  We're getting a warrant.
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  In Illinois, Indiana, and in some areas of Texas,
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  I've read that the police are taking it at night
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:33.000]  out at the side of a road at a checkpoint,
[2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  and that a lot of lawyers,
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  and I've had the head of the Texas bar on,
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  are saying these aren't really real warrants
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  that some of the cities have.
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  It's a blank check warrant that basically the judges,
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  just whatever is called in, are running with.
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  Now, I haven't seen that claim with Austin.
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:46.000]  Yeah.
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  But still, there are concerns here about people who are hemophiliacs,
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  people who are diabetics.
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:51.000]  Absolutely.
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  I mean, I've had blood taken for insurance or whatever,
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:55.000]  and the nurse can't seem to find it herself.
[2:30:55.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  Much less some cop at the side of a road.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  That's quite a line to pass.
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:30:59.000]  But it's not going to be on the side of the road.
[2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:00.000]  I think that that's the image.
[2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:02.000]  You know, I looked at some of the blogs.
[2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:03.000]  I like to listen.
[2:31:03.000 --> 2:31:05.000]  I like to watch and read what's going on in my city.
[2:31:05.000 --> 2:31:08.000]  And some of the comments were, I'm not going to have a bubba cop
[2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:09.000]  sit there on the side of the road.
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  You don't give me a liberty or give me death.
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  They've been doing that in Denver.
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:16.000]  Well, this is going to be a program that if we do launch it,
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:18.000]  it's in response to a need.
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  We've got to, we have to get that evidence
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  to try to hold some of these folks in.
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  But it is a federal grant.
[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:24.000]  If I can get it.
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  I don't know how I'll be able to get it.
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:29.000]  But it is to train a handful police officers as phlebotomists
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  that in an instance where we arrest somebody
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:33.000]  for driving under the influence,
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  especially when they've killed somebody
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:37.000]  or seriously injured or maimed somebody.
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  Remember that we've killed almost 2,000 Texans a year
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  with drunk driving.
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:42.000]  We're the hardest drinking city according to Forbes.
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  So alcohol.
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:44.000]  No, no, we're worse than New Orleans now.
[2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  Yeah.
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  We sell the most alcohol of it.
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  Yeah, well, so.
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  Listen, this out in south of Austin,
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  I was driving by, they've got a liquor store
[2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  bigger than a super Walmart.
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:54.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:56.000]  And so, so Alex, I mean, you know,
[2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  I see you're a father.
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  I'm a father.
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:31:59.000]  We're out here driving on the streets in these roadways
[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  and there is carnage going on.
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:05.000]  This is nothing more than using a lawful,
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  and it will only be done in a lawful manner
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  in a sanitary condition in a secure location
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:12.000]  with some checks and balance.
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  Okay, well, in 1999,
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  they shut down all of 35 from Kyle out to Round Rock.
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  Literally, cars going one mile an hour
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  with police shining lights in people's eyes
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:24.000]  under the federal grant.
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  Why would the feds want to give us this money
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  that we've already paid for in taxes to do that?
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  I mean, are we going to see stuff like that?
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  We don't have checkpoints here.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  I think that you'd have to have a Texas legislature
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  would have to approve checkpoints.
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  But you heard about those big ones they had here, didn't you?
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  No, I haven't heard about it.
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:40.000]  I'm going to have it all.
[2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  I'm the new guy, Alex.
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  You're from LA.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  I'm from LA.
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:44.000]  I know.
[2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  I'm from Texas now, buddy.
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  The slick CIA command base.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  Is it LA?
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:49.000]  God, they can do better than that.
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  What was your role?
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  You were pretty high up in the LA police department.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  No, I was a California patrol chief.
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  I was a state police officer.
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:56.000]  And then you were also a police chief
[2:32:56.000 --> 2:32:57.000]  somewhere else in Texas, weren't you?
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:32:58.000]  No.
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:32:59.000]  Okay.
[2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:01.000]  That's another ace of you, though, I think.
[2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:02.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:33:02.000 --> 2:33:04.000]  But the reality is, look, we have a responsibility
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:06.000]  to keep people alive, and we have a responsibility
[2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:08.000]  when somebody kills somebody out there, seriously injures
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:09.000]  somebody, to hold them accountable.
[2:33:09.000 --> 2:33:12.000]  And I don't want people to think, like, you got to realize
[2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:13.000]  where I started my life.
[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  I started my life in a communist dictatorship,
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:17.000]  and I hope you don't say you like Fidel Castro
[2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  because then those are fighting words with Cubans, okay?
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:21.000]  The reality is-
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:22.000]  Oh, yeah, I'm a known communist.
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:23.000]  Yeah, are you?
[2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  I didn't know that part.
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  But the reality is, the reality is that-
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:27.000]  That's a joke.
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  I'm a Ron Paul guy.
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  Yeah, I know.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  The reality is, I absolutely respect the Constitution.
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  We are a nation of laws, and we will always abide
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  by the rules that is set for us by the public.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  And by the legislature.
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  Well, the problem is the legislature tells Rick Perry
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  you're not going to put these toll roads on existing roads,
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  and he just says, I'm going to do it.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  Well, that's an issue for the legislature
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  and Rick Perry to deal with.
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  Okay, let's bring up the big issue then.
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  You talk about drunk driving.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  And I've got hundreds of mainstream articles.
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  I know you're aware of this.
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  You keep saying that.
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  Well, well, well, because you're a smart guy.
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  But I'm saying, if you want me to pull you this up right now,
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  I can.
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  Absolutely, yeah.
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  I'm just saying we document it.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  Claims I'm making are not claims.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  They're facts.
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  Okay.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  Sheriffs, police chiefs all over the country have said
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  that they pull over a van, say, with 15 illegal aliens in it.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  None of them have IDs.
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  None of them have insurance.
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  Some of them are drunk.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:23.000]  They pick them up.
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  They take them in.
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  ICE won't pick them up.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  The police in the city say $50 fines.
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  We don't have any ID.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  We're letting them go.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  The famous railway serial killer who killed a bunch of people
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  been going around for years.
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  Couldn't be caught.
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  You talk about tracking things and having accountability.
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  Citizens are having their plates scanned, face scanned,
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  control, police everywhere, children spying on us in the schools.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  But then meanwhile, I know for a fact in Austin, Texas,
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  and I've had a bunch of Austin police tell me this and it happened.
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  One night I pulled up at this office and I see two police cars
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  and the lights going about a year and a half ago.
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  And I walk up and my IT guy, he's actually a contractor
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  in handcuffs.
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  He goes, oh yeah, my license expired.
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  I haven't got it renewed.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  And they said, yep, we're just having to arrest him.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  And I said, and then it turned out the cops kind of bulled up
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  when I first pulled up.
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  And they said, oh, Alex Jones, how you doing?
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  We're fans of the show.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  But then they went ahead and said, no, we got to arrest him.
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  And I said, but if he was an illegal alien, you probably wouldn't.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  And he says, you know what?
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:17.000]  They just let him go and we're not encouraged to do it.
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  And Austin's a sanctuary city.
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  Now, and so, so, so what do you say to that claiming drunk drivers?
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  When statistically, you talk about Austin being hard-ranking.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  We know folks from south of the border are hard-ranking too,
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  just like Texans.
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  Well, look, what I've, and I've been talking about this
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  on Spanish media and on Spanish radio and it's from the day I got here.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  If you commit a crime in the city, if you commit a violation,
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  I don't care if you're legal or illegal.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  We're going to enforce the law.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:44.000]  That is our job.
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  And this wasn't a year and a half ago, but why did the officers tell me
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  they weren't supposed to arrest him a year and a half ago?
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  You know what?
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  Some of it may be their own self-perception, their own perception.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  The reality is when we take enforcement action,
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  we base it on the statutes and the ordinances in the city
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  without regard to socioeconomic standing.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  Is this a sanctuary city?
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  It's listed as one.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  This is not a sanctuary city because when we books people at the jail,
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  ICE has access to the jail.
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  They don't come, do they?
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  What do you do when you don't know who somebody is
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  and there's been a stabbing and you've got three witnesses
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  and it's hard to prosecute.
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  Because nobody knows who these people are.
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  And then also then that victimizes these communities
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  because they're lawless.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  Well, absolutely.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  Because we have, there's two things that are happening.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  First of all, immigration control starts at the border.
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  You've got to secure your borders.
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  I think that most major city chiefs,
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:37.000]  that is actually a policy position on the major city chiefs
[2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  here in the country is that we've got to secure our borders.
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  The second part, though, is that we have to be serious about it
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  because here's the unintended consequence.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  If I become an, actually it's an unfounded mandate for me
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  to be doing ICE's work or immigration's work.
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  But here's the problem.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  If it is an evolving door where three days after you get them,
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  if we became an arm of immigration, they're going to be right back.
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  What's happened, what can happen is that we lose the trust
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  of that community that's going to be here and we lose witnesses,
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:10.000]  we lose victims and we all lose.
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  I have friends that work for the federal government
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  in Southern California that used to be frustrated
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  that they'd take people down on the bus
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  and the joke was that the people that were deported beat the bus back.
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  Well, they also...
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  The downtown LA.
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  They also kill police, federal police that commit murders
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  and Mexico will not extra die back to the U.S.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  if there's a death penalty.
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  Absolutely.
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  So, I mean, this is literally like the Wild West.
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  You know about the rocket attacks in Nuevo Laredo,
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  you know about the truck bomb in Dallas,
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  you know about Los Zetas paramilitary Mexican troops are now,
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  and I reported this three years before it hit the mainstream,
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  are now carrying operations.
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  The police are scared of them.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  MS-13, I mean, it's...
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  And then meanwhile, my guy's got an expired license.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  He's off to jail.
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  Well, again, our official position here is that if you break the law,
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  if you violate the law, we're going to treat you the same
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  whether you're legal or illegal, you're going to go to jail.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  So, what do you do when you pull an illegal alien over who's driving a car
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  and they don't have insurance?
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  I mean, how do you ride them a ticket if you don't know who they are?
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  Well, if you cannot reasonably identify who a person is,
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  then you take them forthwith and get them identified.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  Another thing that we're looking at...
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  So, you are taking people to jail who you don't know who they are.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  Our policy allows our officers that if you cannot identify a person,
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  you can go forthwith.
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  But see, that's their discretion.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  You can go forth.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  I mean, yeah, but the police are encouraged to go out and write tickets
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  and generate revenue on the almost broke back city,
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  even though we're a wealthy city.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  But meanwhile, you see, I mean, look, look, let's be honest, chief,
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  you know, and I know there's a double standard.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  There's a double standard to 867 sanctuary cities,
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  and Austin is on the map as one of the worst in the country
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  after LA, Denver, Chicago.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  We've got a Mexican consulate, our mission here,
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  which hands out these crackerjack...
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  The consular...
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  The consular...
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  The consular, yeah.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  I mean, I had the leader of the Republican Senate on a few years ago.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  He and one day himself went and got four fake IDs from a Mexican consulate.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  Well, it is a challenge.
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  But you know, the problem for us as police officers at the local level
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  is policing a community that we know is here,
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  and policing a community that, you know, we don't control the borders.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  We have to control what's in our city.
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  And I think some of the frustration is that the reality is
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  the way that you deal with immigration is you dry up jobs,
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  you dry up some of those opportunities,
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  people wouldn't come here illegally.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  And to me, that's if you're going to get serious,
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  that's where you start, is with employers.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  I agree.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  I am for throwing them.
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  I mean, plus, just as a citizen,
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  I want people to be able to have entry-level jobs,
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  no matter what color they are.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:45.000]  We've got hundreds of millions of people that want to come here.
[2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  And the states are already bankrupt the hospitals.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  One weekend I cut my finger off on accident
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  to help some people with their boat out in Lake Travis.
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  It was flopping around.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  And so the ambulance took me down to the city hospital,
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  and there was just rows of illegal aliens in there who had no insurance.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  Well, that might be an assumption, just because they look Hispanic.
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  How do you know the only one?
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  No, no, I was listening.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  I was listening.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  I was sitting there with my hand wrapped up with a hanging by a piece of skin.
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  And my dad, who's a physician, is there saying he needs to get this attached fast.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  I've called him, he drove down.
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  And I'm sitting there, but it wasn't just that.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  It was poor people.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  It was a play.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  It was a Sunday.
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  Full of poor people who were so poor they don't have insurance.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  And then about half of them were, you know,
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  because I was watching, they'd go up, you know,
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  and they'd say, do you have insurance?
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  Do you have ID?
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  Who are you?
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  And because they knew that they weren't going to have insurance,
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  but they needed to provide care, which I'm saying is good.
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  They went right through.
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  My point is the country is breaking down,
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  and we need to not give third world populations special status
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  or it's going to destroy this country.
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  I'm all for immigrants coming to this nation.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  I'm all, I mean, just like, you know,
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  you were born in Cuba fleeing communism.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  Well, we applied to come here.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  We applied for it.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  No, I know, but I'm all for that's what I'm saying, chief.
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  But here's the issue, though.
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  There are some unintended consequences.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  Remember now, the job of immigration enforcement lies primarily
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  with federal government.
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  It's their job.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  We have people here to keep arguing.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  We shouldn't arrest people that are committing burglaries.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  We can't keep the burglaries, the rapists,
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  all these other folks in jail because there's no jail space.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  If I say they're going to pick them up,
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  then it kind of defeats the purpose of thinking about it.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  If that's the only reason you're taking them there for it.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  But here's our first, here's our challenge.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  The unintended consequences, if you have 10 million people here
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  illegally, that you know, if they get deported,
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  they're going to probably be back within a few days
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  because you know they know the routes and how to come back.
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  We lose potentially 10 million witnesses to crime.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  10 million, one of our kids gets kidnapped at the bus stop.
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  And the little old lady that's the child care attendant
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  for somebody that, you know, they hired somebody.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  I understand people.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  Now they're afraid to call the local cop.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  And they might be, the Amber Alert system actually works.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  I think you know that.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  I mean, and the West Coast has had a 100% recovery rate.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  It is a great system.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  Yeah, but now they're going to use it, you know,
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  for flashing call terrorist tip line.
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  Don't water your yard on Tuesdays.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  You can't, you can't, you can't get crazy with that
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  because it waters it down.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  People lose interest and it loses effectiveness.
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  But that's one of the unintended consequences is that
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  if people start becoming afraid of calling the cops,
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  the cops aren't going to take enforcement action
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  against somebody the next time they victimize somebody.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  It may be you or me or someone else.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  It has to be a comprehensive approach
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  that starts with securing our border,
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  making sure that people can only get jobs
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  if they're here legally or serious about it.
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  But it really is a federal issue that they've got to be
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  the ones that take the lead on it.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  Well, Chief Acevedo, I agree with a lot of what you're saying
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  about how it should be federal,
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  about how it should be enforced against employers.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  It's very hypocritical to arrest these immigrants
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  and treat them bad.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  And believe me, I know how bad Mexico is
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  in Mexico City, 30 million people,
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  half of them live in cardboard boxes.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  It's hell on earth.
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  The problem is this country is like a lifeboat
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  that will pull the boat completely down
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  if we just say unlimited and the crime
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:55.000]  and then give them a double standard.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  And I understand this rationale,
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:42:59.000]  but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  And to just say we have to have, you know,
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  this interface with the community,
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  and so we have to go with Kid Gloves,
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  I'm saying there's not Kid Gloves with me,
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  because I'm seen as the big fat milk cow.
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  I'm seen as the dumb American driving around
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  in their SUV. Trust me, you're not seen as a dumb guy.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  You're seen as a very bright, articulate,
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  well-informed individual.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  I'm just talking about the citizens.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  Citizens are seen as the milk cow to be sucked off of.
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  Well, but here's the issue.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  Here's plain devil's advocate to your position.
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  If I get involved and just start asking people
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  for your papers solely for the reason
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  to see if they're here legally or not,
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  and they get deported and three days later they're back,
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  and now that same person in the future
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  sees a crime as a victim of crime
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  and they will no longer want to cooperate with me,
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  how has public safety been enhanced?
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  Well, I want to be clear.
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  I think if somebody, there should be an amnesty
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  in that if someone comes in to report a crime,
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  it's policy and it's advertised
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  that if you come in for seeing a stabbing
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  or a shooting or a robbery.
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  That's a new visa. That's actually in law now.
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  Yeah, but the Austin cops have told me,
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  and I've sat around at bars and restaurants with them,
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  I've got friends that are cops, I've worked out with cops,
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  and they go, yeah, we're basically told and encouraged.
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  We get in trouble, we get, you know,
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  struggling to merits for other issues
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  if we drag in a bunch of illegal aliens.
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  It's wrong, it's wrong.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  We, but you need to know something about cop culture.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  Cops sometimes talk out of school a lot,
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  where they'll start telling you,
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  and they're talking stories, they're talking shop,
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  and you got to take some time.
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  Oh, now we can't believe the cops.
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  Well, you know, when you're out there at the bar,
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  you're mentioning bars, you're mentioning drinks, you know,
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  next thing you know they got the biggest fish
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  that they caught when they went fishing.
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  You got to take it with a little grain of salt
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  when they're telling stories,
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  because there's a lot of urban legends and myths
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  and everything else that goes into it.
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  Police chief, R. A. Cervado.
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  He is a slick one, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  What are you talking about?
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:55.000]  But the reality is, we will not,
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  when my cop makes a lawful arrest,
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:02.000]  I don't care if the person is legal or illegal,
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:04.000]  our position is we expect them to take
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  the proper enforcement action,
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  irregardless of the person's status.
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  And that's the best I can do.
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  Okay, so police listening right now,
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  and they listen to this show,
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  we're on 90.1, 1335, 90, we're going to re-air this.
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  They're hearing you, they pull somebody over,
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  and there's beer cans in the back,
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  there's no ID, no insurance, what happens?
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  You take the proper enforcement action,
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  irregardless of what their...
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  But what is that?
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  You're saying you leave it up to them?
[2:45:29.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  If it's an offense where it's a ticket,
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  you write a ticket.
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  If it's an offense where they're supposed to put a jail,
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  you take them to jail.
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  But how do you write a ticket if you don't know who they are?
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  They arrested my guy because he didn't have an ID.
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  If you don't know who they are,
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  and you can't identify them, there's tactics.
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  I'm not going to give you the tactics on how to...
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  People can't get their story straight half the times.
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  There's ways to get information, identify people.
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  Stay there, sir.
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  Final segment coming up.
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  Awesome police chief.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  This has been great.
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  Stay with us.
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  I'm enjoying it.
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure,
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  but the symptoms are there.
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops,
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:19.000]  in thousands of people's lives across America.
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look,
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  should be using this product as a preventative
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  I've come with a message of...
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:02.000]  I feel I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent

[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage?
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF?
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  We sit down and shout out.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  The day that we stop asking questions
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  to grow at our own door.
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  a terrible awakening has taken place.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  An inside job?
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  How dare you?
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  I don't think we can do this.
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  And if the government has not told the truth
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  for 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  American Free Press,
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  the only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  American Free Press,
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  written by patriots, for patriots.
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:53.000]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[2:48:53.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists.
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:01.000]  And the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang head-on.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from...
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  Police Chief Arne Cervado is our guest for this segment.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  One more.
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  We're really honored to have him with us.
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  During the break, we were having a really animated discussion.
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  I said, hey, what I don't want is what you grew up in in Cuba,
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  what you fought to leave,
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  and we're glad to have people that love freedom in this country.
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  And our arms are totally open to that.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  And we need people that have experienced tyranny
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  so they can fight against it here.
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  But having children spy on their parents,
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  it always starts out, oh, for drugs,
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  or if you're being abused, or if you're this or you're that.
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  I mean, I've gone and I've seen the abuses.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  I've snatched people's babies and then lie on the forums
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  because I was there and taken for adoption.
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  I know that the system's gotten predatory,
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  and I'm sure you're a nice guy and a good guy and a smart guy,
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  and you see the good in what's happening.
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  I see a lot of the bad,
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  and I know that we're becoming more like a Cuban,
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  more like a Soviet Union, more like East Germany,
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  with the spying, the control, all of this,
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  and it isn't for our security.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  I read the Rand Corporation documents.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  I know how they're federalizing departments.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  I know the larger plan.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  They got a lot of guys like you who are well-meaning
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  and plus their butts trying to protect people,
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  and a lot of good's done.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  But overall, the federal state's growing.
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  The control's growing.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  So I'd like you to speak to that and Chief,
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  and we appreciate you graciously coming in
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  and being interrogated about, you know,
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  your allegiance stands with the state and the city, doesn't it?
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  I mean, your allegiance stands
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  with the Bill of Rights Constitution?
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  Absolutely.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  When we take our oath of office,
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  the Bill of Rights Constitution of Texas,
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  and my job is really my number one concern
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  is the welfare and the safety of the people
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  that live, visit, and work in Austin.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  That's the bottom line.
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  Absolutely.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  I mean, expanding on that, though,
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  and we were privately talking about, you know,
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  you're saying you don't want America to be a police state.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  You were saying you don't want it to be like Cuba.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  I don't want to paraphrase what you were saying.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  You want to elaborate?
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  Well, I think that you have to.
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  That's what your parents were thinking.
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  What was the train of thought?
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  Do they speak out against the government?
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  We never want to be in that kind of place
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  because my father used to tell us
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  when we got this country from here to the moon,
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  there's no better place on earth and I would hope that...
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  And look at you now.
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  Well, and you know, that's why I love this country.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  I mean, it's the best country.
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  With all of our warts and everything,
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  there's no other place I'd rather live
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  than the United States of America.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  It's the greatest place on earth and I'm hoping to...
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  And you know, we're having our liberties taken
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  and there's always these good reasons,
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  there's always these excuses, you know, there's always...
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  I was talking to you during the break about the Tenth Amendment
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  and you were saying, well, the Civil War decided that.
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  Well, yeah, and then Reconstruction decided that.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  But I mean, is there no end to the federal power?
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  Well, you know, again, you know,
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  you're talking to the police chief here in Austin, Texas.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  I try to keep my focus on my local issues.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  I don't have anybody in the federal government
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  dictating to me how to police this city.
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  And the bottom line is that I work for the city leaders
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  and for the people of the city of Austin.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  And my allegiance is obviously to my city and my country.
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  One of those was a huge terror attack somewhere in the United States
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  and they said that we have to implement PDD-51,
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  basically making the president a dictator.
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  What would you do then if they told you, you know,
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  gave you a list, and they have, this has been the Houston Chronicle now,
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  of 3,000 Austinites to be picked up and Alex Jones is on there.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  And there's no judge, no jury, no indictment, no grand jury.
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:34.000]  It's just go pick up Alex Jones.
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  Well, we'd say Alex Jones, we know him.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  We're going to vouch for him.
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  But the reality is we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  You'll cross the bridge to follow it?
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:47.000]  Well, no, to figure out what, if it's a lawful order.
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:50.000]  And we'll make that decision based on what we know to be right.
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  I mean, we got the city to throw out the Patriot Act here locally.
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  You know, to say that we oppose it.
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  So the bottom line is just to remember, we are a local police department.
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  We are a separate entity.
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  And we will operate based upon what our own city statutes are
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  and our requirements are.
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  And I think that's what would be important.
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  But we know that they've trained the police to drive the buses
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  and pick up people during riots.
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  And we know they have the emergency center out at the old airport,
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  the overflow center.
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  Is that still there with the Bolton chains on the floor?
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  I haven't seen it since I've been here.
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  But are you aware of that?
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  There's a Bolton chains where?
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  It's a little FEMA camp.
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  They've got it at the old Mueller airport.
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  I haven't seen it.
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  But you know what?
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  The old airport, I think that's pretty much been...
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  Privatized, yeah.
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  Let's stay there.
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  One minute break, chief.
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  Okay.
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  You are listening to GCN.
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  I'm a local guy.
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  During riots, and we know they have the emergency center
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:49.000]  out at the old airport, the overflow center.
[2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  Is that still there with the Bolton chains?
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  Yeah, it's still there.
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  Well, I have been interrogating him,
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  and I'd like to give him the last five minutes.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  Awesome police chief, Art Acevedo,
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:23.000]  to talk about whatever he thinks is most important
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  to get out of any websites or any points he's making.
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  I would like to see other police chiefs across the country.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  We're on in Chicago, L.A., San Diego, Kansas City,
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  other places.
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  If you want to come on this show, you are welcome.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  We'd love to hear from you here as well,
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  because one thing that will fight tyranny is the people
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  truly being involved in their government
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  and being friends with the police, but not in a spy way,
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  but in the way you're doing it.
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  And so it humanizes both sides.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  Well, again, I think familiarity breeds trust and respect,
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  and the reality is at least we know each other's positions,
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  and we don't have to agree on everything,
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  but we can agree to disagree.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  Please don't take me to the FEMA camp.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  No, we have a special lockup for you.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  I'm kidding.
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  Trust me, we don't have any black helicopters
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  following you around.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  I only have one helicopter for God's sakes.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  I'm trying to get a second, but the reality is...
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  I know it buzzes my house daily.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:15.000]  That must be tank.
[2:56:15.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  The reality is we have a great police department here in Austin.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  We live in a great city.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  Our goal, though, is that we don't want to be naive
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  to think that things can't worsen for us in terms of crime
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  if we don't stay on top of it.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  We want to be proactive.
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  We want to be aggressive,
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  but we want to be respectful of people's rights,
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  and most importantly, we want to make sure
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  that everybody's treated the same and equally that lives here.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  But the last thing I want to say is something
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  I'm very proud of and make the public aware.
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  We have now brought back our police activities league,
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  which is a great program for kids.
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  We're not going to ask them about how their parents are doing
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  and whether they're talking about us or anything else,
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  but we're losing about 50 percent,
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  over 50 percent of our kids that are dropping out of high school.
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  To me, that's the greatest threat to our...
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  No, our society's unraveling.
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  And it starts with kids not graduating from school,
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  and we're doing our little share here.
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  I would hope that your listeners would know
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  that we're having a police activities league
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:11.000]  lock up towards the end of the month here.
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  We have our website at the police department,
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  and police support our program,
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  support our Explorer program,
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  where kids can learn about being police officers,
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  what that field is like.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  They can learn how to take me to a FEMA camp.
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  We're not taking you to a FEMA camp.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  You'd be bored.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  You just said that the cops like listen to you,
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  and I know I've listened to you.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  I'm joking.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  What do we do with you?
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  But the reality is, we have got to invest in kids, Alex.
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  You know that the kids are our future.
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  We've got a lot of kids that their parents are working.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  Nobody's ever around.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  And then the awesome police department,
[2:57:42.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  through our Explorer program and our police activities league,
[2:57:44.000 --> 2:57:46.000]  we want to make a difference in kids' lives,
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  and I hope your listeners will contact us
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  to help donate funds, and more importantly,
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  maybe even help volunteer.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  So you want my listeners,
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  basically they'll be spying on you, you know that,
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  to come in and get involved with the department.
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  Look, we have nothing to hide.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:01.000]  Well, I'll say this.
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  That is the answer to take this government back.
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:05.000]  We have 60% on average,
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:07.000]  people coming out for presidential elections,
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  but 8% in local elections nationally on average.
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  We need to get that up to 80% locally,
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:14.000]  and if good people get involved in government,
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:16.000]  we're going to end up having the police chiefs
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:18.000]  and the mayors and the sheriffs,
[2:58:18.000 --> 2:58:20.000]  and then it's going to be our government.
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  We have handed over our responsibility,
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:24.000]  turned it over to the feds, and I've told the listeners,
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  that is the responsibility.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:27.000]  If the people get involved and you know you're a good person,
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:29.000]  then that'll block the control freaks
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:31.000]  that are trying to get involved in government.
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  We've let all the control freaks
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:35.000]  take over the government.
[2:58:35.000 --> 2:58:37.000]  We're going to talk Texas there for a minute with letting.
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:38.000]  But look, this should know this.
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  Fixing.
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:40.000]  Yeah, fixing.
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  We're going to fix the fixing things.
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:42.000]  Just remember one thing.
[2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:44.000]  This is my perspective about my role.
[2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:46.000]  Ultimately, no matter whatever happens in this city
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:48.000]  that impacts public safety,
[2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:50.000]  the federal government isn't going to answer to that.
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:52.000]  The state isn't going to answer to that.
[2:58:52.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  The chief of police of Austin, Texas,
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:58:55.000]  is going to answer to Austinites,
[2:58:55.000 --> 2:58:57.000]  because I work for them,
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:58:58.000]  and there is no excuse.
[2:58:58.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  We have to stay on top of issues,
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:02.000]  but know this, we are here to serve.
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:03.000]  We have nothing to hide.
[2:59:03.000 --> 2:59:05.000]  We're a transparent organization,
[2:59:05.000 --> 2:59:07.000]  and we're not afraid to answer the tough questions.
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  Well, I have said this.
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:09.000]  Things have changed since you've been here.
[2:59:09.000 --> 2:59:11.000]  We're seeing changes everywhere.
[2:59:11.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  But I just want you to realize,
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:13.000]  those governing the federal government
[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:15.000]  do not have the same altruistic goals of you.
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:16.000]  I will assure you.
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:18.000]  I mean, look at all the chemical and biological,
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  radiological testing they've done on the American people.
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  Do you know about Tuskegee and all that?
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  I mean, the point is,
[2:59:23.000 --> 2:59:25.000]  let's stop completely trusting government
[2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  as well as get involved in government.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  I want to skip this three-minute break,
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  so we have three more minutes with the chief,
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:34.000]  fourprisonplanet.tv viewers, infowars.com listeners.
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  We're going to go ahead and go live during the break.
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:38.000]  For the AM and FM affiliates,
[2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:41.000]  we say bye to chief Art Acevedo.
[2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  Right now, we'll be back with Pastor Chuck Baldwin
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:45.000]  running for president of the Constitution Party
[2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:47.000]  on the other side of this break,
[2:59:47.000 --> 2:59:49.000]  but for those behind the scenes,
[2:59:49.000 --> 2:59:51.000]  we'll have three minutes left with Art Acevedo,
[2:59:51.000 --> 2:59:53.000]  the Austin police chief,
[2:59:53.000 --> 2:59:56.000]  who certainly is changing things.
[2:59:56.000 --> 2:59:57.000]  Okay.
[2:59:57.000 --> 2:59:58.000]  I'm September 11th, 2001.
[2:59:58.000 --> 3:00:00.000]  We're going to go ahead and go back to the chief now, John.
[3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:01.000]  Thank you.
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:02.000]  We're going to continue here with the three minutes we've got.
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:03.000]  I want to thank you for coming in.
[3:00:03.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  No problem.
[3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:05.000]  It was really, really fun to meet you.
[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:06.000]  Can I have you back in every few months?
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  Absolutely.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:08.000]  Okay, great.
[3:00:08.000 --> 3:00:09.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:00:09.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  And again, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.,
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:11.000]  we're going to be rearing this on the syndicated show
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:12.000]  we do at a KLPJ.
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  Okay.
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:14.000]  In the time we've got to close,
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  I just want to pick your brain about this,
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  because I looked it up and found out that police
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:20.000]  are dialing into Nexus Lexus databases
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  and these threat databases.
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  My dad, I sold him one of my cars,
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  and he was driving back from our East Texas ranch
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  a few weeks ago at night at about 10 o'clock.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  He gets pulled over and the cops wait back
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  and they come over and they say,
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  you're not Alex Jones.
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  And they said, and, you know,
[3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  this came up as handle with care.
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  And I heard three, two legislatures ago,
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  four years ago that, quote, they wanted a database
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:46.000]  of you said things about police,
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  what your view was of police,
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  that the legislature almost passed that.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  A, were you aware of stuff like that?
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  And B, do you know what database I'm in?
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  I've been caught for, you know,
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  I've been caught for 22 years.
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:58.000]  I'll be real honest with you.
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  I have never had a database that,
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  I haven't encountered that database yet.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  I mean, does it exist?
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  To my knowledge, it doesn't.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  But the reality is, we here in Austin,
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  our activists are actually pretty peaceful activists.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  I don't think that anybody's ever died from words
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  unless you've incited riots or something,
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  getting people to kill people.
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  We don't want that.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  We definitely don't want that.
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  And our, I don't know if you know this,
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  but our crowd control team are, they're,
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  The Darth Vader?
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  The Darth Vader outfits.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  The, just remember, if it looks tough,
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  and at least we can get people to demonstrate,
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  exercise their First Amendment rights
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  without getting violent, I think we've won.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  I mean, their, their organizational model
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  is protect the first.
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  And we believe that.
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  Well, I will tell you this.
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  We were, we know you have intelligence units
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  about seven, eight years ago,
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  they were having the big meeting
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  for the Forbes Fortune 500
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  here in town at the Four Seasons.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  We were down at the Capitol for protests,
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  and there were big cops
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  dressed up like Hanarch
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  is scurrying up trouble.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  Are you going to have any provocaturing
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  here while you're here?
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  No.
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  We, we, look, my job is to protect people.
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  Here's what I just want you to keep an eye on.
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  So you're changing those things.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  Well, listen.
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  You know you got provocateurs.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  Here's, if I catch them,
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  they won't be cops much longer.
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  Well, I mean, what, what, what,
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  the reality is this.
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  Fidel did stuff like that.
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  Well, yeah, he did.
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  I hope the guy's dead.
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  I'm hoping.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  I wake up every morning.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  That's what, as a Cuban, the first thing is,
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  is he died yet?
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  They say he's holding on by his toenails.
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  Oh, I think it's, I think they have,
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  that's a, remember, weekend at Bernie's.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  I think that's the character.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  I think he's been dead for about a year.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  Hopefully he is.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  But the reality is our primary focus and mission,
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  when we're trying to find out what's going on
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  with, with a, with a demonstration,
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  is not to stop the demonstration.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  It's not to prohibit you or get in your way
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  from exercising first-minute rights.
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  It's to make sure we don't have somebody come in,
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  get in the middle of a bunch of peaceful protesters.
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  And next thing you know,
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  they start throwing things at the cops
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  and things get ugly.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  Hold on, hold on.
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  We're coming back to the main transmission.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  We'll, we'll close it out here.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  Do you have Baldwin?
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  He's all set.
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:04.000]  Okay.
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  I want you to play a three-minute CNN clip
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  about the vaccines killing kids
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  so I can save out of the chief.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  Here we go.
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  Okay.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  Okay.
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  I'm going to say bye to police chief
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  from Austin, Texas, Art Acevedo.
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  We were just talking about police and provocateur actions,
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  which have now been confirmed mainstream news
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  in Canada, in Seattle.
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  They hired police.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  They had feds dressed up like anarchists,
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  attacked police.
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  The cops didn't know to then stage that event.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  He's saying he's not going to have that in Austin.
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  Just know the fed boys are masters of that.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  And again, we just want to thank you for your honesty
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  and your time.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  And I don't want to take any more of your time
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  so you know the next time you come in,
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  I won't twist your arm into, you know,
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  50 minutes again.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  But thank you, sir.
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  Hey, my pleasure.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  And if you need anything, you have any questions,
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  give us a call.
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  Thank you.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  That is the Austin Police Chief leaving us.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  And we're going to go ahead and play the CNN piece
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  about the HPV shots killing people that your young girls
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  are taking.
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  We told you a year ago it was killing you.
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  Now here it is on CNN.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  We know how to read the drug reports,
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  you know, off their own website.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  And we had doctors and scientists and epidemiologists on.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  So here's a little three-minute clip on that.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:12.000]  And then, John, come in with the other clip
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  with Walter Cronkite saying he loves the devil.
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  And then we'll, yeah, it's Walter Cronkite,
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  says he's a Satan worshiper.
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  I'm not kidding.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  We're going to go ahead and play who the feds are.
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:22.000]  And then, I'm not kidding, chief.
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  You can listen to it right now.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  And then we're going to go to the presidential candidate,
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:26.000]  Chuck Baldwin.
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:28.000]  Here we go.
[3:04:28.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  Tequeria Williams doesn't get to act like a kid anymore.
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  She's just too tired.
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  It kind of hurts because I used to do a lot.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  But Tequeria's mother says everything changed last December
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  after her daughter received Gardasil,
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:53.000]  a vaccine that prevents 70% of cervical cancer.
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  She's never been sick.
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:56.000]  She's never been in a hospital.
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:05:00.000]  Nothing until the Gardasil shot.
[3:05:00.000 --> 3:05:02.000]  Two months after getting the shot,
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  Tequeria says she got a rash on her face and arms,
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:07.000]  leaving these scars.
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:11.000]  She had swelling all over, pain in her joints,
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:14.000]  and poor circulation in her fingertips.
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:18.000]  Her doctor told us she now suffers from an autoimmune disease
[3:05:18.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  and says it is possible the Gardasil triggered her illness,
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:27.000]  though she made it clear the cause cannot be proven.
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:31.000]  According to a federal tracking system called VAERS,
[3:05:31.000 --> 3:05:38.000]  there have been 9,749 adverse reactions following the vaccination.
[3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  And 21 reported deaths since 2006.
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:44.000]  I chose to get my daughter vaccinated.
[3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:49.000]  But Merck, Gardasil's maker, points out these are anecdotal cases.
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:52.000]  In a statement, company officials say it, quote,
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:58.000]  does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused or contributed to the event.
[3:05:58.000 --> 3:06:01.000]  An official with the Centers for Disease Control says
[3:06:01.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  VAERS does not provide enough information for researchers to prove
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:09.000]  whether Gardasil caused any of the reported side effects.
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:13.000]  We want to have better data to reassure people.
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:20.000]  But again, the patterns and the number of serious events looked at in VAERS
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  do not suggest any increase in risk.
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:27.000]  While the CDC believes...
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  Perhaps you would better start from the beginning.
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  Perhaps you would better start from the beginning.
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  Perhaps you would better start from the beginning.
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:15.000]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  in the journal Pediatric.
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  These new studies suggest that the opposite,
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay,
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:38.000]  but could it also cause cancer?
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  For now, the government had the right under U.S. law
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  We have to work with dark side while we spend time in the shadows.
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:54.000]  Well, join me.
[3:07:54.000 --> 3:07:57.000]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:07:58.000]  Journal Pediatric.
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:00.000]  These new studies suggest that the opposite,
[3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:05.000]  that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay,
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:10.000]  but could it also cause cancer?
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  For now, the government had the right under U.S. law
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  We have to work with dark side while we spend time in the shadows.
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:26.000]  Well, join me.
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to see.
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:31.000]  There's a need for a new world order.
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  Someday, in the next few years,
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  a solution will emerge.
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:00.000]  Yeah, the chief's leaving listening to us on 90.1 and 13.30.
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  And behind the scenes, he's telling me about all my videos he's watched.
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  I meant to bring that up to him on air and get him to say all that.
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  But he left with a handful of my films.
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  He said, oh, I'm getting brainwashed.
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  Now, I think it was the other way around.
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  I shook his hand and I said, oh, you're co-opting me.
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:20.000]  He was inviting me to go ride around with him and survey things.
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:22.000]  And he said, yes, I am.
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  That guy is going to be going up.
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:29.000]  I don't think he's a bad guy, but I think he's a pragmatist.
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:34.000]  And better watch that R-Day Savito.
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  He will definitely, that's not the last you'll be hearing from him.
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  That guy's something else.
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  I run into a lot of politicians.
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  Let me tell you, he was something else.
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:45.000]  Hey, Bermas, we're about to go to a man who's not a politician,
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  who's a statesman who I'll be voting for for president.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  But Jason, what do you think of that police chief?
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:50.000]  Charming.
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  He was a really nice guy and very well-spoken, presented himself well,
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  snuck around some questions there. I don't know anything about that.
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  But let's see if he's genuine.
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  Let's see if he comes back in here after you have the document.
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  He's either a good guy or he's really evil.
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  I don't think he's really evil.
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  I think that he believes he's doing the greater good.
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  Even his stance on technology, he's right.
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  Technology inherently is not evil.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  Look at how we use technology against them with their corruption.
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  Absolutely.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:20.000]  It cuts both ways.
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  Hey, thanks, Bermas.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  I'm going to have you in later about fabled enemies in the next hour
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  at the end of the show.
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  Okay, I apologize to our illustrious guest,
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  but we're here to promote his campaign.
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  He's been holding for about five minutes,
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:34.000]  but the police chief got here late and we had to say bye to him.
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  And of course, he needs the introduction to this audience,
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  but I want to get an update on what the campaign's doing
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  and what he thinks of things happening in the world.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  That's Pastor Chuck Baldwin, syndicated columnist,
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  and a radio talk show host, a big church down in Pensacola,
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  and he's running.
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  He got the nomination over a neocon for the party
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  that is the only party of choice out there,
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  and that is the Constitution Party, Chuck Baldwin.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  Pastor, thanks for coming on with us.
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  Alex, it's good to be with you once again.
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  Here I am with the awesome police chief telling him
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:09.000]  that Rolter Kwankei loves the devil.
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  Yeah, I caught bits and pieces of that conversation.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  That was phenomenal.
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  That police chief sounds like a number one guy.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  He really is very charming, very nice fellow.
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  Show me pictures of his kids.
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:23.000]  If he's not a good guy, he's one of the few people
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  that can trick me, but he certainly came off credible.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  Okay, tell us how the campaign's going, where it's going,
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  and then give us your take on some of the things
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  that are happening currently, sir.
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  Well, Alex, the campaign is picking up steam
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  and picking up momentum.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  I don't know whether you heard,
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  but we made the front page story in the New York Times today.
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  I did.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  Yeah, they were covering Dr. Corsi's book on Obama,
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  and of course, in the book, Dr. Corsi mentioned
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  that he was voting for me and not John McCain,
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  and so that made the New York Times this morning,
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  and so we're getting a lot of response to that already.
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  But the campaign is really going well.
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  We're getting a lot of phone interviews.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:04.000]  We're getting a lot of invitations to speak,
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  and the train just keeps rolling down the track.
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  Well, in some cynical people that don't understand the process
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  say, well, he's not going to win.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  What's the point?
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  Well, you're going around educating millions of people.
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  Then you get in the New York Times.
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  That's what every newspaper, magazine, and talk show
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:21.000]  and TV producer looks at.
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  Then that gets you booked to other places.
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:26.000]  You reach tens of millions, just like Ron Paul did.
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:28.000]  Bottom line, you grow the liberty movement
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:30.000]  and show the people at a time when it's needed more than ever.
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  There's an alternative to the controlled left and right
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  that's controlled by the New World Order in Washington,
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  the two parties,
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  and so we need to continue to grow that alternative.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  We have any hope in the future of when the time comes
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  being able to have a true restoration
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  of our liberties in this country.
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  That's why people have got to get behind Chuck Baldwin.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex.
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  I haven't looked at it lately,
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  but WorldNet Daily was running a survey in their website
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  as to who would you vote for if the election were today,
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  and I was pulling in second place behind McCain
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  and ahead of everybody else.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  People are beginning to start looking at us
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  and paying attention to us.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  Well, good job.
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  Ron Paul should have run,
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  and I know you were supporting him in that.
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  I don't think he realized, but I know his wife's been real sick,
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  the destiny he was missing.
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  If you're already number two in some polls,
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:22.000]  imagine what it would have been with Ron Paul,
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  but again, that's done now.
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:25.000]  We've got to get behind you.
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  Well, right, exactly.
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  Ron's doing what he feels led to do,
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  and I just have to trust that he's doing the right thing for him,
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  and we do need to pray for his wife, Carol.
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  She's in the hospital doing very poorly,
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  and we certainly need to pray for her,
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:43.000]  and I know the people out there about all across the country are doing that.
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  But, you know, we chose to go ahead
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  and allow our name to be put in nomination,
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  and the party selected me over Alan Keyes,
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  and so here I am.
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  I've been going up and down the country from east to west, north to south,
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:13:59.000]  and we've been getting the same message everywhere we go
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  that people do not trust John McCain.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  They do not trust Barack Obama.
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  They're looking for an alternative.
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:09.000]  They want somebody who's going to represent the Constitution.
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:11.000]  Somebody who's going to preserve and protect our borders,
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:13.000]  our sovereignty, our independence.
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  Somebody who's going to speak against the New World Order,
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  and really, I'm the only one in 2008 that's going to do that.
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  Absolutely. We're going to break,
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  but I want to come back and take phone calls, Chuck Baldwin,
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:29.000]  or also get your take on the Russia situation,
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  the Iran situation policies,
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  while you're 180 degrees from Barack Obama and John McCain,
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  a true constitutionalist, a true conservative,
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  a true Christian American with the Constitution Party.
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  Give out the website and campaign info.
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  You want to get involved on air with us,
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  and Chuck Baldwin right now,
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  presidential candidate on the Constitution Party ticket.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  But before we get a break in 30 seconds,
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  fire out the website and phone number.
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  Right. The website is Baldwin08.com.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  That's Baldwin08.com,
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  and the phone number is toll-free.
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  866-99 Baldwin.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  That's 866-99 Baldwin.
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:11.000]  And give that website out again.
[3:15:11.000 --> 3:15:13.000]  Baldwin08.com.
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:15.000]  www.bald108.com.
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  And we've got links to that up on infoawards.com.
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  We'll be right back with Pastor Chuck Baldwin running for president.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:23.000]  We'll be right back.
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:31.000]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  of reducing government debt.
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:38.000]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999,
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion,
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:03.000]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:06.000]  could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[3:16:06.000 --> 3:16:10.000]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:17.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:28.000]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:31.000]  It is a big idea.
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  A New World Order.
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:38.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:41.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:16:41.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:55.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:06.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress.
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:09.000]  There are many ideas about the Mark of the Beast and the Antichrist.
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:13.000]  What do you know about the Beast, its Mark and the Antichrist?
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:17.000]  Is the Beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  Is its Mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the National ID card, or 666?
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:25.000]  Is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:29.000]  Some believe these things are in the future. Others believe that it's in the past.
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:33.000]  First John states, the Antichrist is already in the world.
[3:18:33.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:39.000]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies,
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its Mark, right to the Bible says,
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:59.000]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771, or call 888-211-1715. That's 888-211-1715.
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  You can run on, you can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:27.000]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down, sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:33.000]  Go tell that long-tongued liar, go and tell that midnight writer,
[3:19:33.000 --> 3:19:39.000]  tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-fighter, tell him that God's gonna cut him down,
[3:19:39.000 --> 3:19:43.000]  tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:47.000]  Pastor Chuck Baldwin is our guest. Your call's in the next segment.
[3:19:47.000 --> 3:19:51.000]  In the last 10 minutes or so I'm gonna have Jason Bernersen studio about his new film,
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:55.000]  Fabled Enemies, and some of the more controversial sections of the film.
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:19:59.000]  Pastor, looking internationally what's happening.
[3:19:59.000 --> 3:20:04.000]  The United States threw Georgia launches a sneak attack on Russian forces.
[3:20:04.000 --> 3:20:08.000]  I'm no fan of the Russians or Putin what they're doing. Don't trust them either.
[3:20:08.000 --> 3:20:13.000]  But this is unprecedented. Now they've got five carrier groups going into the Gulf talking about hitting Iran.
[3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  Internationally, what does the Constitution say we should be doing?
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:21.000]  Well, and the Constitution says nothing about any of that.
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  What we've got going on is we have neglected the wise counsel of our founding fathers
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  that said we ought to have free and fair trade with all nations as much as possible.
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  But entangling alliances with none.
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:42.000]  And what we've done instead is we have engaged in entangling alliances all over the globe.
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  And basically we've done this at the behest of the United Nations.
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:55.000]  The United States has, for the most part, allowed its troops overseas to be the international cops for the United Nations.
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  And so we really have no foreign policy independent of the UN.
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  And as President of the United States, what I would do is work to get out of the United Nations altogether.
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:09.000]  I think we need to get out of NATO. We have no business being over there.
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  It's an organization that doesn't even need to exist at this point.
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  All we're doing is antagonizing other countries over there constantly.
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  And then we wonder why they react sometimes the way they do when the truth of the matter is that our policies,
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  and that's the United Nations policies, for the most part, have created the conflicts that often arise in various parts of the world.
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  And we just need to get out of those situations altogether, start putting America first,
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:45.000]  American interests first, start protecting our borders and preserving the integrity of our country.
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:50.000]  You know, we talk about the evil that's going on over there and what Russia is doing or whatever,
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  but really the real evil that we need to be looking at is what's going on right here in the United States of America.
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  And we need to protect the interests of our country, the security, the borders, the independence of our country.
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  We haven't been doing that. And as President of the United States, that's exactly what I would do.
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:13.000]  Now, everything you said is not just constitutional. It is also popular.
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  But we see both of the other main parties completely ignoring the will of the people.
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  Well, they ignore the will of the people and they ignore the Constitution that they are sworn to uphold.
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  Every constitutionally elected office holder, whether it's President, Senator, Congress, County Commissioner, it doesn't matter.
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  They put one hand on the Bible, they put another hand to heaven and they affirm an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, period.
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  That's what they are sworn to do. But they haven't done that in a long time. They have no intention of doing it.
[3:22:46.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  But upholding the Constitution in my oath to it is something that I take very seriously.
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:57.000]  It's something that Ron Paul takes seriously. And I, like him, would be faithful to that oath.
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  But I can tell you that as President of the United States, I would expect the other members of the federal government to do likewise.
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  Well, for those that don't know history or what an oath's really about, I mean, it is a commitment.
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  It is, I swear that I will faithfully execute this. That's like, if you swear enough to protect your family or your community or you swear enough not to cheat or steal.
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  I mean, it's who you are. It's what you've oath of been sworn and oath will be kept.
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  I mean, this is ancient. This is important. This is who you are.
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:31.000]  And if you won't keep oaths, others aren't going to keep their oaths.
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  And the society descends into hell on earth. And the fact that most of these politicians won't keep their oaths makes them traitors.
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:48.000]  You're certainly right. And I do believe that the real issue confronting America today is not what Russia is doing in Georgia.
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  It's not Iran and these other places. What's the great danger, the great risk to America today is what's happening in our own country.
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  The sacrifice of our borders, sacrifice of our independence, our national autonomy.
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  We see NAFTA being merged into internationalist institutions that are going to literally dwarf the independence of the United States.
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  The NAFTA Superhighway trying to come through Texas there. You've got the creation of the North American Community, North American Union.
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:27.000]  You've got the tripartite agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico to sell out of our sovereignty.
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  Our borders are being erased. We are literally on the verge of losing our very independence and our national sovereignty.
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  The United States is collapsing into the New World Order.
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:44.000]  After finish up when we get back, we're so honored to have presidential candidate for the Constitution Party.
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  Chuck Baldwin on with us. Your calls are straight ahead. Stay with us.
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  Hi there. I want to talk to you about a dirty word. Hangover.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:13.000]  No, I know. As the makers of drinking made hangover defense tablets, we hear it every day. Grown respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  Hangovers are what you got in college when you had about ten too many at the frat house and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  These days? Well sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  Well, call it what you want, but now you don't need to get one. Thanks to drinking made hangover defense.
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  Just pop one fizzy drinking made tablet into a glass of water just after you have a couple drinks.
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:46.000]  They taste great and the patented guava leaf extract formula works while you sleep.
[3:25:46.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  So you wake up with no headache, no queasiness, no hangover.
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  Look for the green box at retailers everywhere. For a location near you, visit drinkingmade.com.
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  Drinking made hangover defense. It's how smart, responsible people like us avoid hangovers.
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:08.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-Eleven was an inside job.
[3:26:08.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:18.000]  I'll do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a state. It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trollateral Commission, the CAF.
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:27.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  The whole hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  Please rise. Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:09.000]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?

[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  That's 501-255-0528.
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:28:15.000]  Visit our website at lazemedinc.com. That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C.com today.
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:22.000]  Pastor Baldwin, the break cuts you off there. Please continue making the point you were covering.
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  Yeah, well, I was just trying to say, Alex, that everybody focuses on what's going on overseas.
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  And we'll hear about Iran, and now we're hearing about Russia and Georgia.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  And what I was trying to make the point is that the real issue confronting our country today,
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  the most serious threat to America, is what's happening right here at home.
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  And the erasure of our borders, the creation of this North American community,
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  the surrender of our national autonomy, and our independence.
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  We are literally on the verge, and I mean we are on the verge of losing our national independence and our national sovereignty.
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:29:02.000]  This is the most important issue confronting the United States of America in 2008.
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:09.000]  And quite frankly, no matter whether it's Barack Obama or John McCain, if either one of these fellows gets elected,
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:15.000]  they will do nothing to prevent this. They will go along with this new world order.
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:19.000]  They will do nothing to protect America's independence and sovereignty.
[3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:23.000]  We will continue to be pawns for the United Nations and this global economy,
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:27.000]  and we will lose our sovereignty as a country.
[3:29:27.000 --> 3:29:32.000]  And I really believe this is the number one issue confronting America today.
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  And for those that are just joining us for the first time, a presidential candidate, Chuck Baldwin,
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:41.000]  I want them to understand that we're not exaggerating, we're not embellishing.
[3:29:41.000 --> 3:29:45.000]  The most dangerous form of political takeover is not military.
[3:29:45.000 --> 3:29:50.000]  As many philosophers and our founders said, it is from within.
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:29:53.000]  And international corporate structures, as the new world order are,
[3:29:53.000 --> 3:29:58.000]  the top 100 biggest economies, 50 plus of them now, it was 40 plus, not 50 plus,
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:01.000]  are not governments, they are corporations.
[3:30:01.000 --> 3:30:03.000]  They have intelligence agencies, private mercenaries.
[3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:07.000]  They bought off county, state, local, federal, international governments.
[3:30:07.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  They have created international governments, the big Rockefeller foundations and others.
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:18.000]  And the U.S. is ceasing to exist, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the sovereignty,
[3:30:18.000 --> 3:30:22.000]  the international agreements, it's all happening right now.
[3:30:22.000 --> 3:30:26.000]  We are at the flashpoint, we are at the key zone here.
[3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:28.000]  And yes, the people are awake to it more than ever and don't like it,
[3:30:28.000 --> 3:30:32.000]  but the establishment just says, we don't care what you're doing, we're going to move forward.
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:36.000]  And so we've got to try to get good people elected locally, we've got to educate people locally,
[3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:39.000]  we've got to file lawsuits, we've got to protest, we've got to refuse,
[3:30:39.000 --> 3:30:41.000]  we've got to say no, no, no, no, no.
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  We've also got to support national figures like Chuck Baldwin.
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:47.000]  And I don't want to hear, you know, well, he doesn't have a chance to win.
[3:30:47.000 --> 3:30:49.000]  Hey, duty is ours, consequence belongs to God.
[3:30:49.000 --> 3:30:52.000]  Resistance is victory, go ahead.
[3:30:52.000 --> 3:30:54.000]  Exactly right, Alex.
[3:30:54.000 --> 3:30:56.000]  You're exactly right, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[3:30:56.000 --> 3:31:01.000]  It's just that, you know, I think it's time that we decide that we're going to do what's right
[3:31:01.000 --> 3:31:04.000]  and just let the consequences be what they may.
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:08.000]  But the fact of the matter is, when Chuck Baldwin becomes president of the United States,
[3:31:08.000 --> 3:31:11.000]  the New World Order comes crashing down.
[3:31:11.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  That is a reality.
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:17.000]  If people are literally concerned about our borders and our national security,
[3:31:17.000 --> 3:31:20.000]  if they're concerned about the loss of our autonomy,
[3:31:20.000 --> 3:31:25.000]  John McCain's out there talking about and promoting the International Criminal Court of all things.
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:30.000]  Well, I was about to say that you're talking about they'll do nothing to stop the New World Order.
[3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:33.000]  McCain and Obama, they're jumping jack cheerleaders.
[3:31:33.000 --> 3:31:35.000]  Absolutely right.
[3:31:35.000 --> 3:31:42.000]  And again, I'm the only candidate for president in 2008 that's willing to address these issues.
[3:31:42.000 --> 3:31:46.000]  I'm the only one that's calling the attention of the American people to what's going on.
[3:31:46.000 --> 3:31:51.000]  I'm the only one who's saying that I want to get America out of the United Nations.
[3:31:51.000 --> 3:31:54.000]  I'm the only one who's saying I want to overturn the Internal Revenue Service.
[3:31:54.000 --> 3:31:56.000]  I want to get rid of the 16th Amendment.
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:32:01.000]  I want to bring America back to its roots and back to the principles of the Constitution.
[3:32:01.000 --> 3:32:03.000]  I want to get rid of the Patriot Act.
[3:32:03.000 --> 3:32:06.000]  I opposed it from the beginning. I oppose it today.
[3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:10.000]  It doesn't need to be revised or reformed. It needs to be eliminated.
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:12.000]  I agree. We only have seven minutes for calls.
[3:32:12.000 --> 3:32:14.000]  I'm going to give each caller five of them.
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:16.000]  Elliot, Scott, Sherry, Carol, and Fred.
[3:32:16.000 --> 3:32:20.000]  That's going to be at each person. It's about a minute and a quick response from Chuck Baldwin.
[3:32:20.000 --> 3:32:23.000]  Elliot and Ohio, you're on the air.
[3:32:23.000 --> 3:32:31.000]  Yeah, Mr. Baldwin, you quickly, if you do become president, totally repeal all of Bush's acts, like the Militia Commission's Act,
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:36.000]  2006, BD-51, both the Patriot Act, John Warner Commission's Act,
[3:32:36.000 --> 3:32:38.000]  John Warner Defense Act.
[3:32:38.000 --> 3:32:43.000]  Also, will you repeal U.S. Code Title 28, Section 3002, Definitions of State,
[3:32:43.000 --> 3:32:48.000]  following on Number 15, the United States means a federal corporation thereby forth,
[3:32:48.000 --> 3:32:52.000]  ending the Anglo-American corporation that is this country, sir.
[3:32:52.000 --> 3:33:02.000]  One of the first things that I will do is to review all of the executive orders that have been executed by President Bush,
[3:33:02.000 --> 3:33:05.000]  President Clinton, and President Bush Sr.
[3:33:05.000 --> 3:33:11.000]  And I would review them one by one, and every one of them that was contrary to the principles of the Constitution,
[3:33:11.000 --> 3:33:14.000]  I would immediately reverse.
[3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:17.000]  Okay, thank you, Elliot. Got to jump.
[3:33:17.000 --> 3:33:20.000]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air.
[3:33:20.000 --> 3:33:30.000]  Yeah, Chuck, it would be nice to get some celebrities behind you, like Willie Nelson, people who have spoken out for the Patriot movement
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  and getting back to the Constitution, people like Willie Nelson, the guy, the actor that are on Alex's show all the time.
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:42.000]  I can't remember their name right now.
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  The point is, these are our slaves. We just can't make them go out and do that.
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  And who knows if Chuck, even once, they're endorsement, but go ahead.
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  I know, though, what I'm trying to say is that it would be nice to get some celebrities getting him into the media spotlight
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  and putting some recognition behind him, too, as well.
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  Well, we're trying to do that, and he's getting attention.
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  And again, just the exercise of resistance is victory. Thank you, Scott.
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:05.000]  Sherry in Texas, you're on the air.
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:07.000]  Hey, Alex.
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  Hi, Sherry.
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  Hey. Hey, Pastor.
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  Hey.
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:22.000]  I'm from Tyler in Northeast Texas, and I just want to let you know that I'm really, really glad that we don't have to vote for either a neocon
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  or a fascist. Yeah, just a member.
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:27.000]  So, yay.
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  Okay.
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  But I was wondering what, if anything, are you planning on doing about the bio defense, that whole system they've set up?
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  Would you move them back out to the islands that they used to be on?
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:47.000]  Yeah, she's talking about the 36 bio weapons labs they've built under bio shield.
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  Yeah, the massive development of race specific bio weapons and things. What would you do about that?
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:56.000]  Okay, you're going to have to bring me up to speed on that, Alex.
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  Well, you know, they've radically increased the bio weapons program of the U.S. to a new global arms race, and they're building
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  and or have built an open, very dangerous level four bio weapons labs in major cities, which contravails all common sense in former policy.
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  Oh, but that kind of thing, there's no call for any of that.
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:29.000]  This only portends, I think, bad things for the United States, and I know what the state of interest are of those endeavors.
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  It has significance for defensive purposes and all that kind of thing.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:40.000]  But I think instead what we're dealing with is the potential to be used against the American people.
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:45.000]  And any such thing as that, I find very, very troubling.
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:48.000]  And as President of the United States, I can tell you that kind of stuff isn't going to happen.
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  Well, we've already had whoever it was, sneak anthrax out of Fort Dietrich and mail it to Congress and the media.
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  So we already have the government who's done all these illegal chemical and biological tests on the American people before now being a source of the anthrax.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:07.000]  So again, they're building them now in major cities, which is a big no-no.
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  That's crazy. Absolutely crazy.
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  Absolutely.
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  I can't, I can't, you know, there's so many things like this that we hear about.
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  I can't even keep up with them all.
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  And the problem with it is, Alex, as you know, as you learn people all the time when you show all these kind of things,
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  the ultimate objective of so many of this stuff is, is internal.
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  And I think the American people need to recognize here that they sometimes are the ones that are in the crosshairs,
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:40.000]  and they are the ones that need to be concerned about what the government is doing in these regards.
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  Any weapon they build for somebody else, I mean, wheeled around against us, and they have before,
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  and over this stuff can accidentally get out all these weaponized, you know, already deadly diseases that have been,
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  you know, made ultra, many more times, more powerful.
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  And you have the Ministry of Defense in England and the Dick Cheney PNAC documents saying they want to use these
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  and kill certain races of people.
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  I mean, that's big news, folks, but the average public isn't aware of it.
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  I had Police Chief Al Cervado asking me, it was, I like your show.
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  I know a lot of it's true, but did you really believe all this?
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  I'm like, hey, man, I don't believe it. It's a fact.
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:16.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carol in Ohio. You're on the air.
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  Oh, Alex, I just think you're, you have done such, so wonderful.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:25.000]  Your show was so great today, especially the interview with that law enforcement.
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:31.000]  And Chuck, you are so well-spoken, and you've hit the target right on the head.
[3:37:31.000 --> 3:37:37.000]  It's our sovereignty, and our growing police stay here at home that we should be concerned about.
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  Well, Carol, have you read all of his great articles he writes? He's very knowledgeable.
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  Yes, I read him all the time, and I also get him via my email.
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:51.000]  But I think we should get behind you as much as we were Ron Paul.
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  You're very well-spoken. You address the issues. You're not afraid to tackle them.
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  And I think we should get this Chuck Reagan rolling down the highway to Washington
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  and get in at all you people that were behind Ron Paul.
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  We've got a man here that we should be giving all our strength and energy to in support,
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  just like we did Ron Paul. So let's get going.
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  Absolutely, Carol. Thank you. We don't have time to get to Fred and others.
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  Thank you, Carol.
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  Because we've got to let Pastor Chuck Baldwin go, and I've got some other news to cover.
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  But he'll be checking back in with us on the campaign. We're here supporting him.
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  Pastor, one minute closing comment.
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  Yeah, well, just to, let me just remind everybody in your audience that this Sunday,
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  we've got several of our friends and supporters that are going to be hosting a money bomb for us.
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  And if anybody would like to help our campaign, if there's people out there that say,
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  what can I do to help Chuck in his campaign?
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:52.000]  This Sunday, August 17th, if you'll go to the address is know newworldorder.com.
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  And again, that's www.knownewworldorder.com.
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:39:01.000]  And that's being put on by the same guy, the Ron Paul Money Bomb and our Money Bomb.
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  That's right.
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:05.000]  And so it's so exciting. Great folks. He's been calling me. I mean to call him.
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  I'm just working 18 hours a day.
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  But yes, that's coming up this Sunday at knownewworldorder.com.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  No more newworldorder.com.
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  And Pastor, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:19.000]  You bet. There he goes. We'll plug that again before the week is out.
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  Remind me to get that Money Bomb guy on.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  So I want to support what he's doing there as well and support Chuck Baldwin.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  And I don't want to hear folks that he can't win.
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  He probably doesn't have any chance, but the point is he has a chance to wake up millions more.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  He has a chance to show up the other two parties and show there's no real choice there.
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  Okay. I want to shift gears now for the balance of the show.
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:39.000]  And I want to come in and play one more time today.
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  The audio from the trailer of the second trailer that's up on infowars.com.
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  And the news and focus, the featured story section.
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  It is titled, Fabled Enemies, the Israeli Operatives Trailer 2.
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  Fabled Enemies, Israeli Operatives Trailer 2.
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  Now, this is about, I'd say, 30% of the film.
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  It's right at two hours.
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:07.000]  But the point is, is that it just gives you the full picture, really shows you the facts that we know.
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  It's very incriminating. Here is the audio of the trailer, the second trailer now up at infowars.com.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  Fox News has learned that some American terrorism investigators fear certain suspects in the September 11 attacks may have managed to stay ahead of them.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  Whether it's because they are in intelligence services or what they were doing, I will defer to the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  That there was a report on the George Washington Bridge that there had been a van, a stop there that had explosives.
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  We have the suspects who did, go to the van, the van exploded.
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  Amdox Limited, an Israeli-based private telecommunications company.
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  It is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones without generating an Amdox record of it.
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:07.000]  It quickly unraveled to be the largest for inspiring ever uncovered inside the United States, the largest.
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  Documents say they, quote, targeted and penetrated military bases.
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  The DEA, FBI and dozens of other government facilities.
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  There's one big elephant in the living room.
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  There's the relationship between the United States of America and the state of Israel.
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  What about this question of advanced knowledge of what was going to happen on 9-11?
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  Well, it's very explosive information, obviously. A bigger question, they say, is how could they not have known?
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:41.000]  Jason Burmes in studio with us.
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  Burmes just got involved with the loose change guys that were dealing with the first one.
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  Then he helped make the second and third one.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  You've been, I guess, with loose change guys, what, two and a half years?
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  And so now you're making the film you want to make and it gets into the British, Israeli, Pakistani intelligence, all working together, all involved.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  Tied into the White House and it's so mentally ill and sick that people out there say,
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  oh, you're saying others were involved. No, it's only Israel. No, it's not only Israel.
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  They're saying that Israel's involved doesn't give them cover either.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  I mean, what kind of mental problem is that?
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:21.000]  What type of major malfunction if we bust 10 guys robbing a bank, all 10, are just as equally guilty?
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:24.000]  The fact that they have accomplices doesn't make them less guilty.
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  It makes them more guilty with the conspiracy, with the forethought.
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  But yes, we're weighing in, as four of my other films do, on this subject that we've always covered.
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  And all the guests we've had on Galen Ross, Tex, Mars, just countless others covering these type issues.
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  But this is really a professional film. It's been done for a week.
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  The DVD is being mass produced. It's coming in next week.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  We're going to ship it out September 1st. Pre-orders, we're going to pre-order the DVD so you get it first when it ships out September 1st at infoawards.com.
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:57.000]  The trailers are out there. It's going to be at prisonplanet.tv for members.
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:43:02.000]  Burma, just in three minutes, describe to people a basic rundown of what this film covers.
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  Well, like you were talking about, this covers not only the Israeli involvement with the Pakistani involvement, the Saudi Arabian involvement,
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  and even the involvement in our own government, especially those taking part in continuity of government exercises that day.
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:20.000]  And now the Black Ops government is used as the cover, the separate government outside to be able to carry it out.
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  Then they use the contractors or the agents to do it out of Israel, out of Pakistan.
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:29.000]  And what this really does speak to is the compartmentalization of the entire op.
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  Okay, you had Pakistan playing its role to fund the Patsy's. They were funding the hijackers probably through U.S. and British intelligence.
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:43.000]  However, they're set up as possibly an enemy in the war on terror, and it doesn't take them long to fold,
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:49.000]  and then let U.S. forces mass in Pakistan to go into Afghanistan. So we point that out.
[3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:58.000]  We point out the Israeli operative teams that were picked up on 9-11, the ones that were cheering the first attack after they had taped it,
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:05.000]  the ones that went on television, the ones that were involved with exploding vans and vans with explosives.
[3:44:05.000 --> 3:44:15.000]  Not only do we cover that, is that we also cover the fact that they needed to gain their intelligence through other sources,
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:21.000]  and those sources seem to be Amdox and Converse, these telecommunications companies.
[3:44:21.000 --> 3:44:23.000]  Continue.
[3:44:23.000 --> 3:44:28.000]  On top of all this, we also get into continuity of government. Now, that's going to be the third trailer.
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  That's going to be out in a little bit, probably a little over a week or so. We've already given you two trailers.
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  But we show you how this was all set into place through war games, exercises.
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:47.000]  Not only the ones done by NORAD, like Vigilant Warrior and Vigilant Guardian, but also Global Guardian,
[3:44:47.000 --> 3:44:55.000]  which was this mass Armageddon exercise that put operational air command centers in the air called E-4Bs.
[3:44:55.000 --> 3:45:00.000]  Now, we had five of these planes, quote-unquote Doomsday planes, in the air on 9-11,
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  and we know that one was on the scene in the Pentagon. That's got a little bit of play. It was on CNN and whatnot.
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:10.000]  And we're going to talk more about this throughout the week, and the whole week you're going to be here while I'm at the DNC with live reports.
[3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:15.000]  You're going to be here covering that. Bottom line, we really went and looked and said, how was this carried out?
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  How did they do it? We just looked at the facts and we bring you from the intelligence side.
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:25.000]  This doesn't look at blowing up buildings or all the things that show they did it, whether it was an inside job.
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:31.000]  This film is different. It looks at how they did it, how they operated, and it totally proves the case.
[3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:37.000]  And it shows you what we found. It shows you how they did it, and people say, how did they do it then?
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:41.000]  We always say, well, we know they're lying about the official story. We know their fingerprints are all over it.
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:47.000]  We know they had a motive. We know they wrote documents saying they wanted to state the tax. We know they've posed the tax in the past.
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:53.000]  This film goes, okay, you want to know how they did it? Here it is. You want to know how these murderers did it? You want to know who did it?
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:45:57.000]  Here it is. It's fabled enemies putting their neck in this. Good job, Jason Burmese.

[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:09.000]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients.
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  Most of which are synthetic.
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing,
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:26.000]  wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:16.000]  Caught like a wildfire out of control.
[3:49:16.000 --> 3:49:20.000]  There was nothing left to burn and nothing left to lose.
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:27.000]  All those drifters days are past me now. I've got so much more to think about.
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:32.000]  Deadlines. Deadlines and commitments.
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:38.000]  What to leave in. What to leave out.
[3:49:38.000 --> 3:49:44.000]  Against the wind. We were running against the wind.
[3:49:44.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  We were young and strong. We were still running against the wind.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  Okay, I'm going to talk more about this tomorrow because they're great.
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  But the winners of the Internet Censorship and Truth Rising Trailer Contest have been announced in the first wave.
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:09.000]  And the two that win, the smaller prizes, I told everybody, you're now disqualified from the next contest.
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:14.000]  That'll be the closes out the 19th. I've got to announce that the 20th.
[3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  But you get 100 or 200. I don't know what it's. It's over 100 entries.
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  It becomes quite a job just to judge these.
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:24.000]  So I took an extra day and a half to announce that I'm evil.
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:30.000]  But due to the overwhelming response to Alexiom's Internet Censorship and Truth Rising Trailer Contest,
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  once $2,000, there's a thousand. The big 5,000 ones coming up.
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:36.000]  People get confused and say, I'm now saying it's a smaller prize.
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:40.000]  So there's multiple prizes. It was difficult to choose the first wave of winners.
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:44.000]  All the entries are excellent. Remember, we have another wave of contest.
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:48.000]  These will all be judged on Thursday, August 19th.
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:53.000]  And stay tuned for those winners. And thanks for participating in the Info War.
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  Now, this was judged, I said off of basic net numbers.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:00.000]  Well, I said the one about Internet Censorship would be the other Truth Rising.
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  I said I would judge by quality, but it also got a lot.
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:09.000]  Enough respect. One, before I even ever found out about it, it had 40,000 views.
[3:51:09.000 --> 3:51:12.000]  It's like 60,000 views now.
[3:51:12.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  And so we are very, very, very excited about that.
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:23.000]  And you can go to infowars.com and watch that trailer right now,
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:28.000]  which is at 55,263 views.
[3:51:28.000 --> 3:51:35.000]  And so they are the winner of the first contest on Internet Censorship.
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:42.000]  The other one, I'm trying to go to the YouTube channel so I can give you the actual winner off their page.
[3:51:42.000 --> 3:51:47.000]  For the Truth Rising, they get $1,000.
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  And their site is OTER01, and theirs has only had like 3,500 views.
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:59.000]  But it is the Truth Rising trailer, and it is the best judged by me.
[3:51:59.000 --> 3:52:02.000]  The other one had the most hits. The other one was just being judged on which one I liked the best.
[3:52:02.000 --> 3:52:04.000]  I loved all the others. They were so good, that was the problem.
[3:52:04.000 --> 3:52:06.000]  I had to watch them over and over again.
[3:52:06.000 --> 3:52:12.000]  I want to thank everybody out there for their support, and you all win by getting the word out about the police state,
[3:52:12.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  about the New World Order, about the censorship, so I commend you all.
