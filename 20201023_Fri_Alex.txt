[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got one!
[00:16.000 --> 00:42.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  That's a big statement.
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  Why would you do that?
[00:54.000 --> 01:16.000]  If you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, and I'd stop giving them federal subsidies to solar and wind, why are we giving it to oil industry?
[01:16.000 --> 01:27.000]  We actually do give it to solar and wind, but that's maybe the biggest statement in terms of business, that's the biggest statement, because basically what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry.
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?
[01:31.000 --> 01:47.000]  President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds to respond, and then I have to get to the final question.
[01:47.000 --> 02:09.000]  This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump, imagine this is your inauguration day.
[02:09.000 --> 02:17.000]  What will you say in your address to Americans who did not vote for you? You'll each have one minute starting with you.
[02:17.000 --> 02:28.000]  We have to make a country totally successful as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs at a short period of time, etc.
[02:28.000 --> 02:39.000]  But I will tell you, go back. Before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together.
[02:39.000 --> 02:53.000]  We had the best black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates, number one in the class, everybody had the best numbers.
[02:53.000 --> 03:02.000]  And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  But I'm cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody's taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it.
[03:09.000 --> 03:18.000]  If he gets in, you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen. Your 401Ks will go to hell and it'll be a very, very sad day for this country.
[03:18.000 --> 03:33.000]  All right. Ladies and gentlemen, that is 100% true. And the fact that they can even tell us we need to have the Paris Accord when China makes no cuts, no cuts in fossil fuels until 2030.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  And then we were already supposed to have cut by 20% and by 2030 be cut by 50%.
[03:39.000 --> 03:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the only reason we have electricity and power and all of this is fossil fuels. You take that away, billions will starve to death and die.
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  And that's what this is, the depopulation plan. That's why Bill Gates stopped saying, oh, the COVID lockdown is great. It's going to cause the collapse of industrial civilization.
[03:58.000 --> 04:09.000]  The United Nations is on record saying they want to quote, limits to growth, post-industrial world. Limits to growth. That's the name of the report.
[04:09.000 --> 04:21.000]  And the project of the UN building a sustainable post-industrial world. Post, meaning bye-bye. Total crap. They want to oversee the new dark ages.
[04:21.000 --> 04:35.000]  They'll still have fuel. They'll still have oil, but they're going to put a big fat Rothschild tax on it that is owned by a consortium of Herman von Roompi and then the Chai comms and the Clintons and Obama.
[04:35.000 --> 04:43.000]  And they have their stinking mercantiles in Chicago and Berlin and London.
[04:43.000 --> 04:51.000]  I mean, this is a criminal, mega massive power grab. And of course, the idiot leftists love it. They want to starve to death in the streets.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  They want to just be abused. They've all got moron Stockholm syndrome.
[04:59.000 --> 05:10.000]  History is now. History is taking place in front of us. We are at the crossroads. We are now only two weeks out from the most historic and important election in world history.
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  I've been saying that for over a year, but now people really understand I wasn't exaggerating. This is so critical.
[05:15.000 --> 05:24.000]  The new world order wants to repudiate the nation state that will repudiate the idea of America. They want to repudiate the idea of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and bring in their technocracy.
[05:24.000 --> 05:33.000]  So they are throwing everything they've got, not just the American people, but the people of the world. That's why your word of mouth is beyond king.
[05:33.000 --> 05:44.000]  It is paramount. When you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when you shoot your own video or write your own article or knock on your neighbor's door and talk to them or call your friends and family and tell them to vote for Trump.
[05:44.000 --> 05:52.000]  When you speak out against the system, when you do things that seem little, together it adds up into giant things. Many hands make life work.
[05:52.000 --> 06:10.000]  History's happening now. Take action now while you still can. Please for all of our futures.
[06:10.000 --> 06:18.000]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  Die. Die. Die.
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.000]  Politically, go by them.
[06:27.000 --> 06:36.000]  Sink into oblivion. Become the relic that you already are.
[06:36.000 --> 06:43.000]  Fade into your political oblivion.
[06:43.000 --> 06:52.000]  Leave the purgatory that you're already in.
[06:52.000 --> 07:01.000]  And fall into your proper universe.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and get into it.
[07:05.000 --> 07:17.000]  The headline info wars.com says it all with President Trump's devastation devastation of Joe Biden.
[07:17.000 --> 07:25.000]  He has secured an even bigger landslide victory that I'm now just going to call it 10 days out.
[07:25.000 --> 07:37.000]  Trump is going to win bigger than he won in 2016 in the electoral college. He might even win the popular vote, though that's the stage where they got so much election fraud going on.
[07:37.000 --> 07:50.000]  But just as sure as the sun came up this morning and will set this evening, you can bet your bottom Benjamin Franklin or your bottom George Washington or your bottom Thomas Jefferson.
[07:50.000 --> 07:59.000]  You can bet your bottom Greenback that they're going to contest it and have the states start breaking up and just have the biggest fiasco you've ever seen.
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  They already said the last election was illegitimate.
[08:02.000 --> 08:06.000]  And now they're saying if Trump fights them doing that, he's contesting the election.
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.000]  They're saying you're not allowed to contest.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  We contested four years ago with no evidence.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  Now we're going to contest but you can't fight back.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  And folks, they're going to hit, listen to this prediction and maybe you'll stop them from doing it.
[08:20.000 --> 08:27.000]  But they're going to hit the infrastructure, the power grid, the cell phones and not just the Internet.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  And they're going to say that the Russians did it.
[08:29.000 --> 08:42.000]  Whereas if you actually hear what the NSA and the CIA and the Director of National Tells is saying, and I know it's true because we have industrial level defense systems that we use that are amongst the largest companies in the world.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  And it's all Chinese.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  I mean, Russia, it doesn't even, just doesn't even gauge.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  And sure, you can run a tax out of the United States and say the US did it or run out of South Africa or Japan.
[08:54.000 --> 09:02.000]  China's not hiding the fact that they are hammering the living snot out of US companies, out of US customers.
[09:02.000 --> 09:13.000]  They're stealing tens of millions of US citizens identities, they're stealing your credit card money, they're making purchases in your name and mailing them to themselves by the millions a day.
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  I mean, we're being just assaulted by China and China brags about it all over their news.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  I've got it right here on the stack today.
[09:23.000 --> 09:30.000]  And so NSA comes out and says, warning all Americans, we're being hit by communist Chinese, millions are having their identity stolen a day.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  Watch out, check your cards, check where it's going, cancel them immediately if you're having a problem, beware.
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  They're hacking into home appliances, beware, they're hacking into the cell towers, beware.
[09:41.000 --> 09:49.000]  And then you get this article out of AP, US, when they say US, they mean Democrats, Russian hackers targeting state local networks.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  Oh, yes, the Russians, the Russians, they're the ones.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  No, it's the Chikoms.
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  And of course, the Russians are probing things and doing that. Everyone is.
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.000]  And Russia is an adversary of many levels. No one will ever deny that we're an adversary within their adversary of us.
[10:06.000 --> 10:15.000]  But China is the big thousand pound bully that is, let me give this analogy that's having sex with your mom, I guess.
[10:15.000 --> 10:23.000]  You know, let's say you're five years old and there's this big mean motorcycle gang dude that weighs 400 pounds, that beats your mom and beats you.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  And there's nothing you can really do. She's scared.
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  I mean, that's the Democratic Party is your mom.
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.000]  And the Chikoms are like the big thug.
[10:34.000 --> 10:43.000]  And you've got the globalists that put the big thug in power, but that's really where this country is.
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  And your mom has Stockholm syndrome.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  She's got cigarettes put out on her.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  She's, you know, she's not eating enough or ribs are showing.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  He broke her arm, you know, last year, knocked some of her teeth out last month.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  And she's just scared of him and she defends him.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  Whatever his name is, give him a name.
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  Oh, Bobby's good. But Jack's nice.
[11:07.000 --> 11:15.000]  And, you know, if you don't do something about him, he's going to end up killing your mama.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  Because when I talk about the Democratic Party, I don't mean the evil Chikom globalist operatives that run it.
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  The average Democrat out there is either a Stockholm syndrome woman that just is totally scared and believes whatever they're told,
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  or it's a sniveling, pedophile degenerate type that hates America.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  And that's who they are.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  But the most of them are not bad people.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  They're just stupid, very stupid people.
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, the first debate was not a debate because it was two against one and they just tried to keep Trump off balance.
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  The second one was an attack dog woman.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  That Savannah lady was just, like I said, a snapping turtle on methamphetamine.
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  And then you had last night where she still was a little bit unfair to Trump,
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.000]  but she actually tried to do a real debate and Trump mopped the floor with that old demon.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  And, you know, I told you months ago, he's clearly getting blood transfusions.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  He's plumped up. He's got red her skin.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  Trump came out and said, I got a transfusion. I feel great. That's what he got with that plasma.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  That's the type of transfusion.
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  But even with all the transfusions and everything, Biden is sinking fast and can't get his lies together.
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  But we're going to play all these clips coming up.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  Did you see the whopper after whopper?
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.000]  Your son and your brothers got money from the Moscow mayor, 3.5 million, not disputed.
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.000]  Not, you know, hundreds of millions from China, not disputed. 30 million in one deal alone from Ukraine.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  Not disputed. They're not disputing the emails either.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  They just go, oh, Russian disinfo. Oh, sure.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  At the Mac shop where your son left the computer and now all confirmed they have all the emails.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  They've gone and contacted those on the email list, have confirmed that the emails were sent to them, were from Hunter.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  And people are coming out now that were in press conferences.
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  They started last night, more coming today, that were in the business meetings with Hunter.
[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  And with Joe Biden, when they were promising that they were just going to run a scam.
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  And these are people that said, listen, I'm not going to run a scam on taxpayers.
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.000]  If I'm going to get a government contract, I'm going to do the work. I'm not going to do something legal.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  They're like, relax, man. We're untouchable.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  That's what the fellow said in the press conference.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  He's on record, worked with them for years, all of it.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  He said, I'm not going to be part of this. And he's in the email chains.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  So they're going through everybody in the email that isn't comfortable with this.
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  But see, that's why Biden got up on TV at the CFR two years ago and said, you know, they were investigating my son, Hunter and Barisma.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  So I called up and I said, well, I was there in person.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  You got till the time I fly out in six hours to fire that prosecutor or you don't get the billion dollars.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  And son of a bitch, they fired him an hour later.
[13:59.000 --> 14:07.000]  He does that to act powerful and to sit up there at the CFR with the head of the CFR and all those globalists and say,
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  I influence pedal. I take bribe money.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  I sell out the American people.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  But see, he knows the media won't call him.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  Like when he kept saying Trump, you put children in cages.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  Trump changed all that. Those are very nice facilities now.
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  They don't split up the parents when they come in with kids that are undocumented and are with men being smuggled by coyotes.
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.000]  They are separated. You don't put four year old girls with 50 year old men or 20 year old men.
[14:34.000 --> 14:41.000]  You don't know our little boys. That's why even though I suppose that the headline Senate report finds thousands of children
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.000]  released under Obama program ended up in sex trafficking and dead.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  So Trump fixed that. Talk about a manager.
[14:49.000 --> 14:57.000]  He went in, he fixed an incredible problem and Biden point seven says you kept kids in cages and Trump hitting back five times saying,
[14:57.000 --> 15:05.000]  you put them in the cages. The media time magazine ran the fake story saying it was me. Those are under you.
[15:05.000 --> 15:13.000]  And the media won't even call Biden on him, even though it's 100% true. Incredible. That's coming up.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  All the flip flopping on ending fossil fuel.
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  It's not just him saying we will end fracky. He's on video saying we will end fossil fuel.
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.000]  Listen to me. You've got a guarantee for me. He says to the lady, I will end fossil fuel.
[15:30.000 --> 15:38.000]  Things up there with Trump. I never said that. I mean, my God, you've got to be a moron to buy anything this guy says.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  Absolutely crazy. All right, we're going to lay it all out when we come back. Got a big guest coming up.
[15:44.000 --> 15:51.000]  I'm going to open the phones up again, but wow, Trump is going to win big, big, big, but they're not going to concede.
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  And they're going to throw this country into even greater turmoil. Everything's just been paying a testing so far.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  The exact same videos, we can comment and share them everything.
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.000]  Trump has finally figured this out since he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech.
[16:37.000 --> 16:43.000]  I mean, he's modern in this situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action.
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.000]  We the people are taking action now and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  and checking out the new redesigned infomores.com and sharing that with you.
[16:53.000 --> 17:20.000]  I hope that really upset some old, yeah.
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  Trump's base and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.000]  This is what all the old Clintinesis are saying. It's what the Obama bots are saying.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  It's what Keith Overman's saying. It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and forced inoculations.
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying vaccines will be voluntary.
[17:50.000 --> 18:00.000]  Donald Trump or die. We've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote and tell your family to vote now.
[18:00.000 --> 18:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  Well, things didn't go too well for the big guy.
[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  You know, pop, the head of the Delaware crime syndicate.
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000]  No, pop got the horns of the bull.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  He got politically murdered last night.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  And by the way, I wish no harm against Joe Biden.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  The last thing we want is for anything to happen to him.
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  I've been predicting that there will be some type of false flag event against Biden.
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  And sure enough, I'll cover this next segment.
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  Oh, they claim somebody got caught with a truck full of weapons coming to kill him.
[18:50.000 --> 18:57.000]  The exact same thing happened. Remember, in Florida, four years ago, the so-called Trump supporter, and it turned out to be a provocative event.
[18:57.000 --> 19:05.000]  Just like with Governor Whitmer, I said watch of the eight, the six that have been indicted.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  Watch the two leaders will be FBI informants.
[19:08.000 --> 19:17.000]  And of course, exactly eight days later, it came out in court that both the leaders were FBI informants.
[19:17.000 --> 19:27.000]  So the big guy, he tells his sister, hey, at least I don't take half the money of the jobs I got you like Popdash.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  And this family's living very well.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  Hunters making about $5 million a year.
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  His brothers are making about $10 million a year.
[19:36.000 --> 19:46.000]  Everybody's got to give the big guy 50% of this 10% of that.
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  We're talking about 30 million is going to be paid to him.
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  The big guy gets half of that.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  All right.
[19:56.000 --> 20:02.000]  So that's the fellow using his son as a bag man, but let's let's let's get to the big one right now.
[20:02.000 --> 20:10.000]  The United States had the cheapest electricity in the world until Barack Obama got in and he said, if you've got a coal power plant, we're going to shut it down.
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  And coal is totally clean now with our scrubbers.
[20:12.000 --> 20:14.000]  Nothing comes out of carbon dioxide and water.
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.000]  Both plants need.
[20:17.000 --> 20:23.000]  And then it creates distillates that can be used in other parts of industry like steel production, you name it.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  They're able to take everything out of that coal.
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  Even what's dirty coal, they got clean burning coal that is perfect.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  It doesn't create all the distillates and then they take the distillates and put them into other products.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  So they have a perfect cycle.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.000]  Carbon is amazing.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  We're a carbon based life form.
[20:39.000 --> 20:46.000]  And so the club of Rome and the globalist back at the 60 said, we'll start taxing carbon claiming it's going to cause an ice age.
[20:46.000 --> 20:57.000]  That's what they taught me when I was in middle school was that light comes through the smog and then can't bounce back up to space.
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  And so you get global warming.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  But then they also would teach, oh, no, actually, the light can't get in through the smog.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  It's going to cause an ice age.
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000]  They were teaching us both when I was 10 years old, 12 years old.
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  Because they don't know, folks.
[21:11.000 --> 21:16.000]  And what they do know is one big volcano puts out more than all the humans do in 10 years.
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  That's on record.
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.000]  Mount St. Helens was more than a decade of human carbon to the atmosphere.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  It happened in a couple of minutes.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  Krakatoa, Pompeii.
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.000]  Look it up for yourself.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.000]  It's incredible.
[21:29.000 --> 21:30.000]  You look what they do.
[21:30.000 --> 21:37.000]  A big volcano will make the sunset redder and darker for years sometimes.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  It'll make it get dark a lot earlier a lot of evenings because it's already so much stuff.
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.000]  I'm sorry.
[21:42.000 --> 21:43.000]  I'm digressing.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  You didn't do it in for that.
[21:45.000 --> 21:53.000]  Point is it's such a fraud to say, let us track everything you do, tax all carbon and pay it literally into a Rockefeller Rothschild.
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.000]  Al Gore, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama.
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.000]  I mean, I gotta tell you, Barack Obama and the Clintons made deals with the Rothschilds and Rockefellers
[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  where they're major shareholders in the global mercantiles in Germany, England and the U.S.
[22:08.000 --> 22:15.000]  It's Frankfurt, not Berlin, London and Chicago.
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.000]  In fact, if you look at the deals they've got with carbon trading, for every dollar you'd pay in a carbon tax
[22:21.000 --> 22:29.000]  when you were gassing up your car, whatever it's set at, Al Gore would get two pennies every time you paid a dollar in carbon.
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  I mean, can you imagine everybody gassing their cars up and then the tax on plastic and the tax on natural gas
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  and the tax on, oh, grain is not seen as a good thing.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  It's a greenhouse gas coser because it makes the cows fart, seriously.
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  So now we're going to put a tax on that and Europe already has this.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  Canada has it and it pays money to Al Gore.
[22:50.000 --> 22:57.000]  When you're in cows fart, they even have these torture bags they put on the cows in Germany and in Canada,
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  huge giant bags on their backs and they shove a huge hose up their air in
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  because they're saying methane is a deadly greenhouse gas.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  So they just, there's always been bovine, water buffalo, same species.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  That's what the bovine species is.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  We just domesticated it thousands of years ago and you've got bovine all over.
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  Remember the Plains Indians? Remember what was out there? The buffalo.
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  Oh, do they have to have bags on them?
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  There it is, folks. I'm not joking.
[23:28.000 --> 23:37.000]  A bag on the back of the poor milk cow with a tube run up its butt.
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  Now, that's what they do in Canada.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Oh, wear a face mask.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  It doesn't protect you.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.000]  Oh, shove a tube up a cow's butt and then pay the Rothschilds some money.
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  Pay Bill Clinton some money. I mean, you can't make this up.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  And the farmers follow their orders and they go in and shove a hose up its rear end
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  and the cow goes out and grazes and chews its cut and then they capture the methane
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  and then they pump it into a well and then money gets paid to the Rothschilds.
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  And they just laugh at everyone. It's such a sick joke, but I'm going to stop.
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  Here he is last night, Joe Biden, flip-flopping again and now admitting,
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.000]  yes, that he will, quote, phase out fossil fuels.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  Earlier he told the situation, I'm going to end them. Here it is.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  Would you close down the oil industry?
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  Well, I have a transition from the oil industry, yes.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  Oh, that's a big statement.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  It is a big statement because I would stop.
[24:30.000 --> 24:31.000]  Why would you do that?
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  Because the oil industry pollutes significantly.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  Pollutes?
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  Here's the deal.
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.000]  That's a big statement.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  over time, over time.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  And I'd stop giving to the oil industry.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  That's enough of him.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  This has nothing to do with the oil industry.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  It's about survival.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  It's the left that wouldn't let California for 30 years cut all the underbrush.
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  And that's why you have all those giant fires.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  It's a fact, but they know the public doesn't know about fire breaks.
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  If you told people 50 years ago, we're not going to cut fire breaks anymore.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  They'd have you arrested.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  But in the land of fruits and nuts, 30 years ago, they stopped it.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.000]  It was crazy.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  And now the average leftist is so stupid.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  They hear Trump going, we're not doing forest management.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  They're not cleaning up the underbrush and raking.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  That's what you do in Europe is they rake it.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  You go and you rake the forest, so it doesn't happen.
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  You use that as fuel as well or for other things like fertilizer.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  It's ground into the big honey pots they've got.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  That's a nasty name, not a friendly name.
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  The Germans ever something nasty.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  They put their own feces in the honey pot and mix it up with all the mulch and the stuff
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  raked up from the forest, but it makes a very nice fertilizer.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  But I'm going to stop getting into agriculture, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  I'm just going to stop now and I'm going to play some of this flip-flopping.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  Here's Biden on literally killing billions of people is what cutting fossil fuels off would do.
[25:54.000 --> 26:01.000]  Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration?
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  No, we would work it out.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those.
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.000]  I guarantee we're going to end fossil fuel.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  No more, no new fracking.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  I gradually move away from fracking.
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  And I think it's critically important on day one that we end any fossil fuel leases on public lands.
[26:21.000 --> 26:27.000]  What about face-stopping and fracking and stopping pipeline and structure?
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  They want to do the same thing I want to do.
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  They want to phase out fossil fuels and we're going to phase out fossil fuels.
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  But he said last night that Trump has misrepresented him.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  He doesn't want to end fossil fuels.
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  He doesn't want to ban it.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  He just wants to phase it out.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  Kind of like when grandma dies.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  Oh, she's just transitioning.
[26:48.000 --> 26:55.000]  These people are psychotic master villain criminals that make the legend of doom look like sweetie pies.
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion and ultra-12 are now back in stock after being sold out for months.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  They're sold out because people know that high-quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins, minerals, especially zinc,
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your immune system.
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.000]  Well, both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com's two-week softening election.
[27:17.000 --> 27:24.000]  And we're offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple-patria points to your next order.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  Also, if you sign up for auto shipping and additional 10% off, that makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  Now, we have had a big clearance sale going, so a lot of stuff's sold out.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  A lot of the other stuff is close to selling out.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  Some of our best sellers are still there, and some of them have actually come back in to stock.
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the other things that have actually sold out.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  So those should be back in stock as well soon.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the air.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  Obviously, we're critical of the fight, and you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[27:54.000 --> 28:01.000]  If you pay close attention to what Big Tech is actually saying, and more importantly, what they're actually doing,
[28:01.000 --> 28:11.000]  when they shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story, that was a test to see if they could work in concert to totally suppress information.
[28:11.000 --> 28:17.000]  Because they've also been on record saying, coming up on election day and thereafter, they're not going to let anyone but, quote,
[28:17.000 --> 28:24.000]  authoritative sources, that means CNN, New York Times, what a joke, come out and say who the real winner is.
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  That way they can contest the election, even though Trump's declared winner, hold everything up with the ballots,
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  then cause a constitutional crisis, call for secession, and have the UN come in and declare the election for Biden.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  And so when you see them in concert censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[28:42.000 --> 28:51.000]  that is a drill, that is a test to get all their systems ready, but also to condition the public that Big Tech works in unison to suppress speech and information.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  This is Election Meddling 101. This is illegal.
[28:54.000 --> 29:03.000]  It's taken me two and a half years to finally even be able to convince Congress and the rest of the world that we were only the initial target
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.000]  to set the precedent for coordinated Big Tech censorship.
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.000]  Now the world finally understands it.
[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  But we don't have two and a half years for the learning curve to take place this time.
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.000]  Bill Gates and the UN are on record saying the lockdown is permanent.
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.000]  It is a plan to lower carbon footprint.
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  It is a plan to make the world population poor.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  It is a diabolical power grab.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  It is a revolution against the industrial revolution.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  They call it the post-industrial world.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  And it's the excuse for them to take control of every fast of our lives and implement absolute authoritarianism.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  So again, everybody out there, if you love your children, like my daughter that just woke up here,
[29:43.000 --> 29:50.000]  and if you care about yourselves in any future, you need to get awake, you need to understand this information, you need to warn others, okay?
[29:50.000 --> 30:09.000]  It's a life and death situation.
[30:20.000 --> 30:27.000]  Well, Bob Oluxki's got a meeting with the FBI.
[30:27.000 --> 30:34.000]  He's the former business associate of Hunter Biden and Joe Biden on record.
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  He's got the emails to prove it.
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  And he says that the emails that Giuliani have are real because he's got them on the other side.
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  He's been nonpartisan.
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  Hell, worked with the Bidens.
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  But he said he's not going to stand here and watch this country sold out to foreign powers.
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  He's not a traitor.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  The numbers are between 5,000 and 10,000 people.
[30:51.000 --> 30:54.000]  The FBI tried to bribe posing as Russians.
[30:54.000 --> 31:00.000]  They could not get one conservative nationalist or patriot.
[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  One person to take the money.
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  Now, you think about that long.
[31:05.000 --> 31:09.000]  You think about that hard.
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  It makes me really proud of patriots.
[31:12.000 --> 31:17.000]  A lot of folks got, you know, grandmas with cancer or the wife's got cancer.
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  You know, you got big debts or whatever.
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  Oh, it's not going to hurt a little.
[31:21.000 --> 31:23.000]  I take a little money from the Russians to give them a little info.
[31:23.000 --> 31:27.000]  But no, they could not get one person.
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  What a loyal, good group of people.
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  Salt of the earth.
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.000]  And we're living right next to devil-worshipping pedophile filth.
[31:35.000 --> 31:42.000]  That use the fact that we are blind to their evil because we don't operate like they do to get away with this.
[31:42.000 --> 31:49.000]  And because they know the general public cannot believe what's going on because it sounds so crazy.
[31:49.000 --> 31:52.000]  By the way, they've got big Daily Mail articles out and a bunch of others saying,
[31:52.000 --> 31:58.000]  oh, Alex Jones is making it up that there's pedophilia or underage girls or sex stuff.
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  It's PizzaGate 2.0.
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  He's making it all up.
[32:02.000 --> 32:10.000]  Imagine writing an article trying to create something that's false and attributed to somebody else.
[32:10.000 --> 32:18.000]  So you can cover up the massive human trafficking of women and children and men as slave labor.
[32:18.000 --> 32:28.000]  And the Bidens and Epstein and the Clintons up to their eyeballs in it.
[32:28.000 --> 32:34.000]  I mean, do I need to rattle off the Clintons and the AP investigation of the thousands of missing Haitian kids?
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:35.000 --> 32:40.000]  All the rest of it, I mean, it goes on and on. Hell, the Clintons didn't just steal billions of dollars from the Haitians.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  They, with their foundation, Haitians thought they were good guys.
[32:44.000 --> 32:49.000]  Now they know the Clintons are the most hated people in the world in Haiti.
[32:49.000 --> 32:53.000]  And you've got all this coming out now.
[32:53.000 --> 32:58.000]  Senate report links Hunter Biden to prostitution and human trafficking ring.
[32:58.000 --> 33:01.000]  Oh, that's Fox News.
[33:01.000 --> 33:06.000]  See, they've got a problem, ladies and gentlemen, because that's what these people are involved in.
[33:06.000 --> 33:11.000]  They're involved in serious organized crime.
[33:11.000 --> 33:17.000]  And with serious organized crime, you're going to have bare minimum brutal prostitution going on.
[33:17.000 --> 33:25.000]  And I mean, by brutal, I mean, kept women that got tricked out of their countries who are basically sex slaves.
[33:25.000 --> 33:36.000]  And that's on the high end of bad, but, you know, not anything compared to sex with children, abuse of children,
[33:36.000 --> 33:43.000]  harvesting of organs, I mean, you name it, if you can think of it, and then some, they're doing it, okay?
[33:43.000 --> 33:52.000]  So you imagine being, I'll show you this in a minute, imagine being with Daily Mail, who, the word is you could pay them to write stories about people.
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  Like I said, that's why some stories are good, some are bad, but they're just always lying about me.
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  They've had articles that I wear swastika shoes at the office.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  You know, why would they make up something so ridiculous?
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.000]  Well, in psychological warfare, they found, if you're doing what they call black propaganda, meaning lies.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  If it sounds outrageous and weird, it must be true, because who'd make that up?
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  It's like the New York Times says that I ate an employee's goldfish.
[34:19.000 --> 34:26.000]  There's never been a goldfish here. I like fish. I have goldfish.
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  I have little aquatic snails until he died in an aquatic frog.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  Not eating my employee's goldfish. What the hell?
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  But again, they're all plagiarists. They're all crooks.
[34:39.000 --> 34:50.000]  So notice crooks of the mind stealing the truth that that's from Wolf of Wall Street, folks. They can't even write an original lie.
[34:50.000 --> 34:58.000]  Sorry, I'm digressing. So just every morning when you get up, think you're lucky stars that you're not these people.
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  Just take a trough. He doesn't have to lie. He doesn't want to lie.
[35:01.000 --> 35:08.000]  He's neurotic about it all being right out there in the open and him defeating the people that are lying.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  And there he was destroying Joe Biden. We'll play more of the clips in the next segment.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  And where Joe Biden said, I'm not involved in any corruption. Nothing.
[35:17.000 --> 35:26.000]  But let's go to FBI S. Hunter Biden's ex-business associate, Tony Bobolinski.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  I'll pronounce that right for an interview. And he's laying it all out.
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  So this is a real person confirming emails that Giuliani has, and they say more are coming out today, more tomorrow.
[35:35.000 --> 35:42.000]  Wow, what a 10 days this is going to be. But after we play this clip, I'll talk about their tricks up their sleeves and what we've got to be ready for.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  Here it is.
[35:44.000 --> 35:51.000]  My name is Tony Bobolinski. I served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy with high security clearance.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  My father and grandfather both served for decades in our country's armed forces.
[35:56.000 --> 36:04.000]  Since leaving the Navy, I've been involved in various successful businesses, both in this country and abroad.
[36:04.000 --> 36:18.000]  I'm making the statement to set the record straight about the involvement of the Biden family, Vice President Biden, his brother Jim Biden, and his son Hunter Biden in dealings with the Chinese.
[36:18.000 --> 36:25.000]  I've heard Joe Biden say that he's never discussed business with Hunter. That is false.
[36:25.000 --> 36:33.000]  I first hand knowledge about this because I directly dealt with the Biden family, including Joe Biden.
[36:33.000 --> 36:46.000]  I have also heard that Vice President Biden said on Tuesday that Senator Ron Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, should be ashamed for suggesting that Biden family sought to profit from their name.
[36:46.000 --> 36:58.000]  Well, here are the facts I know and everything I'm saying is cooperated by emails, WhatsApp chats, agreements, documents, and other evidence.
[36:58.000 --> 37:12.000]  And the American people can judge for themselves. I brought, I guess, for record three phones that spanned the years 2015 through 2018.
[37:12.000 --> 37:18.000]  These phones have never been held by anybody else besides myself.
[37:18.000 --> 37:28.000]  I was told this past Sunday by somebody who was also involved in this matter that if I went public this information, it would bury all of us, man.
[37:28.000 --> 37:38.000]  The Biden's included. I have no wish to bury anyone. I've never been political. The few contributions I have made have been to Democrats.
[37:38.000 --> 37:49.000]  But what I am is a patriot and a veteran. To protect my family name and my business reputation, I need to ensure that the true facts are out there.
[37:49.000 --> 38:08.000]  In late 2015, I was approached by James Gillier, whom I had known for many years about joining him in a deal which he said would involve the Chinese state-owned enterprise, CFC China Energy, and what he called one of the most prominent families in the United States.
[38:08.000 --> 38:28.000]  I was informed first by Gillier and then by Hunter Biden and by Rob Walker, who was working with the Bidens, that the Bidens wanted to form a new entity with CFC, which was to invest in infrastructure, real estate, and technology in the U.S. and around the world.
[38:28.000 --> 38:36.000]  And the entity would initially be capitalized with $10 million and then grow to billions of dollars of investment capital.
[38:36.000 --> 38:45.000]  After months of discussion, I agreed at Gillier and Hunter Biden's request to become CEO of the entity to be called Sino Hawk.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  Sino representing the Chinese side, Hawk representing Hunter Biden's brother, Bo's favorite animal.
[38:53.000 --> 39:03.000]  And between February and May 2017, we exchanged numerous emails, documents, and WhatsApp messages concerning Sino Hawk and its potential business.
[39:03.000 --> 39:18.000]  On May 2nd, 2017, the night before Joe Biden was to appear at the Milken Conference, I was introduced to Joe Biden by Jim Biden and Hunter Biden at my approximately hour-long meeting.
[39:18.000 --> 39:25.000]  The full video has been posted to Bandod Video. They're trying to block it on Facebook, YouTube, everywhere else, but now the FBI is being forced to investigate.
[39:25.000 --> 39:38.000]  The Bidens are coming down. Those of you that bet on Gigi Ping and China and bet against America, you pedophiles, you liberals, you leftists, you're going down, you're losing, you're going to lose.
[39:38.000 --> 39:45.000]  You're punks, you're scum, you're filth, you're going down. The sleeping giant is awake. Get ready.
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.000]  Full video. I witness the Bidens corruption drops bombshells before final debate.
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  It's on Bandod Video. I suggest you share it.
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.000]  I've got some really important and, quite frankly, bad news for you.
[39:58.000 --> 40:05.000]  We've confirmed from high-level sources in our own research that if Joe Biden is able to steal the election, and they're going to really try to do it, they're that crazy.
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  They intend to not just shut down in full force but have yours truly, Alex Jones, arrested.
[40:09.000 --> 40:21.000]  And here's the really bad news. They're coming after everybody, and they're coming after the economy, and they want to totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  But here's the really good news. The really good news.
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  Humanity is awakening to this threat. We're no longer asleep.
[40:28.000 --> 40:38.000]  And we understand that the globalists are our mortal enemies, and we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free market and our Judeo-Christian roots forever.
[40:38.000 --> 40:53.000]  That's why we must come together now as Americans, every race, color, and creed, and repudiate the New World Order, and stand firm, and vote for Donald Trump, but also the Information War, support independent media that tells the truth, like infowars.com. Thank you.
[40:53.000 --> 41:01.000]  Black Friday in October. Last year, that was one of our most popular sales that we ran in the last couple weeks of October.
[41:01.000 --> 41:12.000]  And it was popular for a reason. Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October. And that means 30% to 60% off, store-wide free shipping, triple-patriot points.
[41:12.000 --> 41:19.000]  That's 15% off your next order. And everybody that signs up for auto-shipping additional 10% off, that makes many of these items lost leaders.
[41:19.000 --> 41:31.000]  Now, a lot of stuff sold out. Some of our best sellers are still there. But some good news. Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all the other vitamins and minerals and amino acids for adults and children that boost your body's natural defenses.
[41:31.000 --> 41:42.000]  It is back in stock, back on sale today, which is two weeks to the election. And more good news. Ultra-12, it's got the name Ultra for a reason. Highest quality, Vitamin B-12.
[41:42.000 --> 41:51.000]  Take it under the tongue for full absorption. It is now back in stock. Both of those are 50% off at infowarstore.com. Infowarstore.com.
[41:51.000 --> 42:13.000]  Black Friday comes in October.
[42:22.000 --> 42:33.000]  No more pesky lawn order. When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe. Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[42:33.000 --> 42:54.000]  But wait. Vote for Democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes. Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[42:54.000 --> 43:06.000]  The future isn't coming, it's here. And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset.
[43:06.000 --> 43:17.000]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset. The world being built by the technocrats. And the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown.
[43:17.000 --> 43:26.000]  This is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[43:26.000 --> 43:36.000]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050. This is their stated goal.
[43:36.000 --> 43:57.000]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy. We turn this around. You must study their own writings. You must face the facts. And you must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[43:57.000 --> 44:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:12.000 --> 44:19.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[44:19.000 --> 44:31.000]  As crazy as things are right now, and as they, you're about to get a lot crazier. Just remember, these are the good times, folks. Let the good times roll.
[44:31.000 --> 44:39.000]  We've got populist movements taking over all over the planet. We've got globalism and trouble. We've got the New World Order being dealt defeats on every front.
[44:39.000 --> 44:51.000]  They always had this hyped up virus global martial law lockdown you and take over plan in the hopper. They launched it early. It was very successful up front. Now it's unraveling quickly.
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  Things are not going well for the New World Order. Okay.
[44:55.000 --> 45:05.000]  And believe me, I don't, I'm not a cheerleader. I'm not going to get up here and tell you stuff. If I don't deeply, deeply believe that and research that you're welcome to call in later.
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.000]  Give me your view. I'm not saying I've got a monopoly on truth here.
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  But in my spirit, I feel very good.
[45:14.000 --> 45:25.000]  Last night, I did part of the debate here live. I went home to watch it with my family and I started crying.
[45:25.000 --> 45:35.000]  And when I was driving to work today, I cut a little ad. I was about to cut out about standing up for President Trump and admiring President Trump and not being ashamed of that.
[45:35.000 --> 45:45.000]  And just what admiration really is because it's not envy. It's not jealousy. It's the opposite. It's love and it's something being an example and just appreciating it.
[45:45.000 --> 45:59.000]  Because I know what it's like to be on the spotlight under pressure and I'm a young man compared to him and what stuff he goes through and how he does it. It just reatures my eyes because, you know, if this is personal, but it's personal for all of us.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  If they get Trump out of their folks, their whole agenda is just going to collapse in on top of us. And it's going to be absolutely hellish.
[46:06.000 --> 46:17.000]  We're going to end up rolling back abortion. We're going to end up turning around so many things that the child traffickers and the group he set up to stop that is already doing so much good.
[46:17.000 --> 46:25.000]  I mean, we've got the enemy on the damn run. And I just can't believe that all Americans don't just wake up and go, wow, this makes sense. Let's support this.
[46:25.000 --> 46:38.000]  They're just so hooked on Hollywood and that poison. But the good news is that disgusting show cuties with 10 and 11 year old girls shaking their ass and manipulating men sexually and saying it's our bodies.
[46:38.000 --> 46:46.000]  We can do it if we want. Very sick feminism, feminine, pedoism, pedo feminism.
[46:46.000 --> 46:57.000]  And that's how the left pushes it. Oh, it's love. Like Biden said, oh, it's love when you chop your old son's balls off. It's all sick freak stuff, man. Oh, Nambla, the North American man boy love.
[46:57.000 --> 47:06.000]  It's love. Children are allowed to love big potbellied men.
[47:06.000 --> 47:11.000]  But now they lost a million plus subscribers.
[47:11.000 --> 47:19.000]  A couple hundred thousand just last week. People are just finally like, what the hell is this? Yeah, they're pedos.
[47:19.000 --> 47:29.000]  I mean, I'd say half a Hollywood or pedophiles, folks, because you don't get into the club unless you're doing some really nasty stuff. Okay.
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  Yep, they're down 1.3 million from their forecast. Just lost 177,000 last month.
[47:34.000 --> 47:46.000]  Let's stop there. Let me get back to this big whistleblower, Tony Babelinsky, and he may be veteran officer respected worked with them on record.
[47:46.000 --> 47:52.000]  The laptop's real. He confirms the emails he's got. He worked with them and it got so corrupt he couldn't be part of it.
[47:52.000 --> 47:59.000]  He goes, I'm going to run real companies. I'm not running shell companies. I'm not scamming people, but it was a company for people to invest in, which is the payoff.
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.000]  I'm investing a million dollars your company, wink, wink. I don't care. It never comes back to me.
[48:04.000 --> 48:11.000]  And so this is coffin nails, ladies and gentlemen. And then there's the Moscow wife of the mayor that paid 3.5 million.
[48:11.000 --> 48:25.000]  You know, you always have the wife or the kid do it. That's so Hunter's dad can sit up there and say, I've never taken one dime from a foreign government.
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.000]  My sons and my brothers do and then they give me half of it.
[48:30.000 --> 48:47.000]  Well, racketeering and federal law and common sense shows if the dawn in Italian crime family, which were taught only Italians operate like this, it's all the groups, gives an order to a captain who then gives an order to
[48:47.000 --> 48:59.000]  an underling to give an order to a soldier to kill somebody. The dawn is just as guilty or more because he premeditated it and gave the order when he gives the order to kill somebody.
[48:59.000 --> 49:08.000]  He killed them just as much as the person that walks up and shoots them in the side of the head.
[49:08.000 --> 49:21.000]  President Trump signs a death warrant to kill a terrorist. And he hands it off to the army. When George Washington would do that, to say, OK, this person's violent rules war, kill them by the means necessary, it gives them an order.
[49:21.000 --> 49:35.000]  George Washington killed those people. When a general gives an order for a predator drone operator to drop a bomb on somebody, that general killed those people just as much as the person that punched the button did it.
[49:35.000 --> 49:43.000]  And he's 100% guilty, more so because of the premeditation, because he sits on top of that crime syndicate.
[49:43.000 --> 49:51.000]  So here's the gentleman in the press conference turning his phones over saying, I want the FBI to come get him. The FBI is coming today, reportedly. Here it is.
[49:51.000 --> 50:09.000]  After months of discussion, I agreed at Gillian Hunter Biden's request to become CEO of the entity to be called Sino Hawk. Sino representing the Chinese side, Hawk representing Hunter Biden's brother Bo's favorite animal.
[50:09.000 --> 50:30.000]  And between February and May 2017, we exchanged numerous emails, documents and WhatsApp messages concerning Sino Hawk and its potential business. On May 2nd, 2017, the night before Joe Biden was to appear at the Milken conference, I was introduced to Joe Biden by Jim Biden and Hunter Biden.
[50:30.000 --> 50:45.000]  At my approximately hour-long meeting with Joe, that night we discussed the Biden's history, the Biden's family business plans with the Chinese, with which he was plainly familiar, at least at a high level.
[50:45.000 --> 51:06.000]  After that meeting, I had numerous communications with Hunter, Walker, Gillier and Jim Biden regarding the allocation of the equity ownership of Sino Hawk. On May 13, 2017, I received an email concerning allocation of equity, which says 10% held by H for the big guy.
[51:06.000 --> 51:22.000]  In that email, there's no question that H stands for Hunter, big guy for his father, Joe Biden, and Jim for Jim Biden. In fact, Hunter often referred to his father as the big guy or my chairman.
[51:22.000 --> 51:38.000]  On numerous occasions, it was made clear to me that Joe Biden's involvement was not to be mentioned in writing, but only face-to-face. In fact, I was advised by Gillier and Walker that Hunter and Jim Biden were paranoid about keeping Joe Biden's involvement secret.
[51:38.000 --> 51:54.000]  I also had a disagreement with Hunter about the funds CFC was contributing to Sino Hawk. Hunter wanted 5 million of those funds to go to himself and his family, so he wanted the funds wired directly to an entity affiliated with him.
[51:54.000 --> 52:12.000]  I objected, because that was contrary to our written agreements concerning Sino Hawk. He said, referring to the chairman, his father, that CFC was really investing in the Biden family, that he held the Trump card, and that he was the one putting his family legacy on the line.
[52:12.000 --> 52:22.000]  He also said to me on May 17, 2017, that CFC wanted to be my partner, to be partner with the Bidens.
[52:22.000 --> 52:36.000]  During these negotiations, I repeated to Hunter and others that Sino Hawk could not be Hunter's personal piggy bank, and I demanded that proper corporate governance procedures be implemented for capital distributions.
[52:36.000 --> 53:02.000]  Hunter became very upset with me. CFC through July 2017 was assuring me the funds would be transferred to Sino Hawk, but they were never sent to our company. Instead, I found out from Senator Johnson's September report that the 5 million dollars was sent in August 2017 to entities affiliated with Hunter.
[53:02.000 --> 53:18.000]  Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the Senate committee members concerning this matter, and I will be providing to the FBI the devices which contain the evidence cooperating with what I have said, so I will not be taking any questions at this time.
[53:18.000 --> 53:35.000]  Right now, he's meeting with the FBI. This will go into a black hole, I'm sure, but here's a new article out, National Pulse. This is out of the emails that's in there. That's what Giuliani's saying. This is accurate. The pseudonym being used by Joe Biden appears to be Peter Henderson, who is a Russian mole in the Tom Clancy novels.
[53:35.000 --> 53:49.000]  So we should probably get the guy that actually ghost wrote most of those books. I mean, that's on record. Steve Pachinic on. Here it is. It's from Peter Henderson to Robert Biden. That's Hunter's real name. Keep in touch. Love dad sent from my iPhone.
[53:49.000 --> 54:05.000]  So he forgot he was on an iPhone, sent it to the Peter Henderson email, said of the dad email. Caught, read, handed. I mean, they're screwed, glued and tattooed, folks. And that's why they're so upset. All right, we're going to go to break.
[54:05.000 --> 54:19.000]  Didn't plug this hour. Need to plug. We're selling out of out of the mineral fusion. People know it's got a lot of zinc, a lot of D three, everything you need for you and your children for your overall health, your immune system. It's a great booster. Even Lord Fauci says so.

[54:53.000 --> 55:11.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have banned.video on your iPhone. Simply go to banned.video with your safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app.
[55:11.000 --> 55:27.000]  I suggest banned.video. You will now have banned.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[55:27.000 --> 55:44.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email on Facebook on Twitter on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share banned.video.
[55:44.000 --> 55:57.000]  With two weeks left until the historic election, we're launching the biggest sell of the year, the top some already amazing sales. It's Black Friday comes in October special, something we did last year that was very, very popular.
[55:57.000 --> 56:05.000]  We did it for the whole month last year. We can only do it for 11 days till the end of the month because stocks are low and a lot of our best selling products.
[56:05.000 --> 56:18.000]  But two things that came back in and that we're now announcing at 50% off with free shipping is Ultra 12, incredible high quality B12, take it under the tongue, look into how great it is, your body's defenses, your health, your stamina.
[56:18.000 --> 56:28.000]  That's back in stock and vitamin mineral fusion with the zinc and the other vitamins and minerals that are essential and amino acids to make sure your body uploads it better.
[56:28.000 --> 56:44.000]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com, vitamin mineral fusion and Ultra 12, the flagship products of Black Friday comes in October sale at infowarstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[56:58.000 --> 57:20.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[57:20.000 --> 57:30.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[57:30.000 --> 57:42.000]  I told you about, I don't know, six or seven months ago I really felt a surge in energy of a victory. I'm not sure what went on or what happened but I felt an even bigger one this morning.
[57:42.000 --> 57:54.000]  I think you can feel it. You can see it. We're really an arm wrestling contest. We're starting to really rip the arm off the opponent and they're going to pull a lot of nasty stuff until they're not released a super bio weapon.
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.000]  They've already got his prime for lockdown for that.
[57:59.000 --> 58:17.000]  But humanity is awakening and getting right with God and that's what really matters and evil is not arrogant anymore. And it's not on the March it's still running things and stole all the money and able to dominate and able to do this bad stuff but the tide is turning.
[58:17.000 --> 58:29.000]  I was out in Florida a few months ago on a quick vacation with the family and we were out on this little island. We rented a pontoon boat and I was out there with an anchor. We were snorkeling around.
[58:29.000 --> 58:34.000]  My daughter's and I, my son, you know, he's moved out now. I don't want to go hang out with us. It's okay.
[58:34.000 --> 58:56.000]  And the 18 man, they get quick fast and they, you know, they said, Hey, at about two o'clock tides and go out and a man. Sure enough, I barely got the engine started and out of there before the tide went out and we were, we would have been stuck on that sandbar until I guess the next day or whatever
[58:56.000 --> 59:12.000]  the tide came in, but that's what's happening is the tide was going this way. And then the last couple of years it kind of got in that point. There's a point when you're out there and there's not a current suddenly and then also it goes and then it just speeds up.
[59:12.000 --> 59:28.000]  And by the time I turned that pontoon boat on and got the anchor out, it was like foot to have a water have been like five feet just an hour before. And I was going against the current to go back out of that area and I was just barely getting out of there.
[59:28.000 --> 59:40.000]  Globalists aren't going to escape this. They're fricking in trouble, baby. And, and, and because the other real fight is always between good and evil. And it's in each one of our souls is where the real fights happening.
[59:40.000 --> 59:54.000]  And so there's big problems on the horizon and AI and the new world order and fentanyl and the chai comms. But I mean, this battle, this war right now, I mean, the globalists are scared, man. They were arrogant. They thought they were invincible.
[59:54.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  Now, as soon as Pelosi and Biden are gone and those old skeletons are gone, you'll have some younger, smarter, more cutting globalists to deal with.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  And that's another thing. I mean, it's like Trump said last week, he's saying exactly what I'm saying. It's like, this should be easier to do. My God. I mean, these people want to screw you over, man. They really hate you.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  They're totally in bed with foreign countries with one side of deals. And Trump's like, I don't even blame China now. They don't even get most the money. These, these jerks get it.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  It's like Trump said, he said, I could raise billions of dollars for my campaign. These people want me to call up. They want me to sell out. But I call up a big corporation and they give me $50 million. I got to do what they want.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  That's why Joe Biden's been way outperforming Trump in money. And Joe Biden's like, you're with Wall Street. You're with you are taking money from the Chinese.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  And Trump specifically, and it's all true goes. Yeah, we were looking to start the business over there. 2013 didn't work out. 2015, it was closed.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  He didn't tell you the last part that was a failure because, you know, about half what Trump does is a failure. That's the way it is with any business.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  I mean, hell, if you have only half your business is failure doing really well. Oh, he declared bankruptcy three times on three companies in the same year.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  I mean, you know, most movies are a failure, right? You know, Hollywood creates a corporation for every movie. You know, Steven Spielberg, even though most of his movies are quote, successful, he's had a bunch of bankruptcies.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  They bankrupt the film. That's how if you're a Hollywood star, but you sign on for a percentage, you never get it or in music because the record company can just mess with the numbers and say it wasn't profitable.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  I'm digressing. When we return, I'm going to hit just the incredible news is breaking. Give the number out. Take your calls. Catherine Austin Fitzgerald is joining us again. She knocked out of the park.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  I wish she was on a few weeks ago. So much is just coming down right now. It's on.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  I admire President Trump. He's really proven himself to be unmatched. His wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy. And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  He's not God. He's not an angel. He's not perfect. But the way he has used judo on the forces of the New World Order has been really incredible. The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  And the way he stood up against these America-hating, God-hating, family-hating trash is beautiful. And I'm serious. I was just bringing tears to my eyes driving to work this morning thinking about President Trump. I just want to say I admire the President so much.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  And I appreciate you, the listeners, and everybody for what you've done. I admire you. That's what you call it, thank me, folks. I admire you. I admire Trump. I admire all of you that are involved in this fight. And I just wish I could do more. We're going to win this fight together. This election is so important. Please pray for President Trump.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  There are no more countries. There are no more borders. There are no more nations.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  And sure, those countries, those borders, those nations have had their problems. But what is it being replaced with?
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Oh, globalism, which means kumbaya and love. But it doesn't mean that. It means authoritarianism, AI control, absolute enslavement.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  You know, TV viewers see one set of ads, video ads, radio listeners hear audio ads and little news pieces we do and little vignettes and commentary, because all the other Toxio hosts run ads during their breaks. And our local stations do that. But I run commentary, mainly.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  And I was driving in this morning, and I was just thinking about what a great job President Trump did last night in that debate.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And just how proud I am of Trump and how I understand everything he does and I understand why he does what he does, and I'm just really synced up with the president. It's amazing.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  I don't think I've ever been synced up with anybody like this. There's something going on here. This is God. I know you feel it and see it too.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  And you always have those lingering doubts because you're so used to being lied to and so used to being screwed over and so used to fraud that when the real thing finally happens, you just can't believe it.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And instead of hating my enemies, when I do hate them, it's not good to operate off it.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  We do this because we love our children, we love our country. And just in that moment, I was thinking I was going to cut a minute about Trump's accomplishments and how he's surrounded, how we need to pray for him.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  And then I was just thinking about how thankful I am to God for President Trump and for you that it just burst out crying and not tears of pain, but tears of joy, that there's not just evil in this universe.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  Now, let me give you the bad news, though, because Trump's going to win in the landslide, but the fraud's so high that they had a chance of making it look like he might have lost.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  Just gut level, thousands of data points, research, the spirit, you know, you can't quantify wisdom.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  Last night was such a devastating victory. And it was so obvious to everyone that you can spiritually feel even the moderators and the reporters have to act like they hate Trump.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  You could just feel America completely seeing what was real and what was fake.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  And when Trump points that even says, look at your politician answers, those are sick. People don't want your crap.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  They want to have a good life and not be lied to anymore. And it was just so damn true, man. That's why I love the truth so much.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  I'm a very truthful person, but I don't. I mean, I've lied to cops when they pulled me over, you know, 20 years ago or whatever.
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  Do you have any beer in there? Oh, no, officer, you've been drinking. Oh, no, certainly not. Okay, you can go. Cops pulled me over, you've been drinking. Yeah, I had a half bottle of wine. Boom, you're arrested.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  I love the truth so much now that it's actually become like a problem because in the Bible, there's times when the, you know, Israelites go into spy on somebody because they're trying to defeat their enemy and they lie.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  And there's times, you know, you didn't see Jesus lying, though. And I'm not saying I'm Christ like I'm just getting the point where I just, I've lost, I'm losing the capacity to lie.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  And that's why they say Trump lies all the time. Remember at first, oh, he's crazy, but he does what he says he'll do. He doesn't lie.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  It's neurotic how he doesn't lie. It's the opposite. That's why a bunch of the speech you go, well, to be honest, the Democrats also have supported this policy, which is a good one.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  You know, and he doesn't even want to give them that, but he doesn't want to train his mind and lies because when you train your mind and lies, it messes with your processing.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  It corrupts your brain. When you tell somebody a lie, you know what, set a line sometimes, if something's uncoupled, I just don't say anything.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  I'm not talking. So we have the Fifth Amendment. And I don't mean to talk about myself. I'm just talking about the journey everyone's having, and I have a soul, you have a soul.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  And my gauge of what's going on is big, gigantic victory last night, and we shouldn't be ashamed of Trump, our champion, and we shouldn't be ashamed of what God's given us.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  I mean, you imagine if Hillary had been in for four years where we'd be, they had this COVID thing planned, they had all the race riots planned, and then she was going to orchestrate this whole thing and totally split this country, even worse than Barack Obama did.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  That's their mission from the Chinese is to demoralize us and turn us against each other. And their plans are burning down in front of us and watching Joe Biden culturally, spiritually, intellectually bleed out last night was a beautiful thing.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  I do not want anything physically to happen to him. I want him politically annihilated.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  Because he is literally the example of an arrogant corrupt lawyer who thinks is, you know what, doesn't have a stench.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And who's been pissing in the face of this country for 47 years. And I mean, I relish getting this guy off our back. I relish it, but you got to vote. You got to get others to vote. You got to be vigilant.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  Because they're going to activate race riots. They're going to say Trump really lost or that it's contested that he won't let them count all their ballots. They'll have Democrat blue states do it.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  And then they're going to hit the power grid and say the Russians did it.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  In fact, they're going to hit the power grid in the stock market if Trump's people aren't able to stop them.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  And I'll tell you, because the enemy already knows this, a lot of systems in the days of the election after they're bringing in extra engineers and people to try to take them offline.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  But you saw how the Russians took their Internet offline a few months ago. They're talking about doing it during the U.S. election because they want to just be able to shut the Internet off outside of Russia, meaning outside stuff can't get in.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  That way people can't claim their networks are doing things. And they also see a massive cyber attack coming that can shut down civilization. The Russians aren't stupid.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  And so if you study the type of attack profile the Globals are going to launch, it'll be saying Russians brought down the U.S. power grid.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  A false flag on the Russians. That's the next move.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  So race war, cyber attack, massive one blamed on the Russians, plunging the stock market, political assassinations.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I mean, these people have never gotten in trouble for what they've done.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  So the good news is Trump did a great job. He's great. People are waking up. The enemy isn't going to give up.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  I mean, they're not going to give up. If one thing they don't give up.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  And we should open the phones up and ask, what do you think they're going to pull?
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  They're going to pull false flags. People try to truck bomb Biden. Hell, they might kill Biden to make him a martyr because he's such a loser.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  That's the only way to save a loser who's politically dead is to kill them and then you can have them resurrect like the Phoenix, not literally, but metaphysically.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  So, yeah, they might kill Biden. They might assassinate Biden. They're definitely going to attack the power grid and the Internet.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  Because then if there's Internet kill switch, we're starting to have a place selective, since it's not going to work enough for them, they want to cripple things to create a sense of confusion, sense of desperation.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  And then they plunged the stock market 10, 15,000 points, you know, right before Thanksgiving or maybe right after Thanksgiving.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  Now they'll probably do it before Thanksgiving because they're going to want you to, while they're contesting election to go home, you all freaked out and scared.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  Yeah, that's what they'll do. Probably got a, probably got a rider truck loading it up with Ampho right now.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  They've got to, I'm sure they do, but they do, of course they do.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  I mean, they've always got a bunch of these little hamsters running around in hamster wheels because they've never gotten trouble and they got all this stolen trillions of dollars.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Oh, yeah, the police departments, the military is all ready for civil war and anarchy and race war and all this crap that, oh, Jones is crazy.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  He says coming towards the election, the left's going to try to trigger civil war.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Well, those two-year-old headlines didn't age too well, did they?
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  But see, that's what it is when you're over the horizon, radar over the, I see over the horizon, which is not hard.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  These people have a damn playbook.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  They've done it all over the place and they always war game it in think tanks.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  So I'm like, hey, look, the Atlantic Council's wargaming three years ago, a civil war in a contested election if Trump wins.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  Oh, and then three years later, John Podesta is in the emails and is in the phone records at a phone conference at the DNC saying we'll have the states secede and have a race war.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  I mean, it's just like, I mean, if I was on the phone to the Republican Party going, and then we're going to secede and we're going to have a race war and we'll have big things so bad they'll have to call in the military.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  I mean, they'd be like, hey, Mr. Jones, please come with us.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  I mean, this is like way beyond blowing up the Hoover Dam or something.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  I mean, this is blowing the whole country up for the chai comms all because Hollywood has a weird hatred of the country.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  And so they want to just fetish and they all want to screw our kids.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  I mean, screw these people, man.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  You want us to go to hell?
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  You go to hell.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  Trump has finally figured this out.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  And since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech, I mean, he's modern situation.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  So we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  We the people are taking action now.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  We're going to do it very, very easily by sharing 2020 election center dot com.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  We're going to go to election center dot com and check out the new redesigned info wars dot com and share that.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Oh, that really upsets them.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  It was 30 months ago that info wars.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  And of course, yours truly Alex Jones was banned on more than 60 major platforms in one day led by the CEO of Apple Tim Cook,
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  who helps China run giant death camps.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  Always let that be in the back of your mind. We talk about these monsters and where they're taking us.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  They have no bottom.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  And people said, Jones, how are you taking it?
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  And I said, I'm taking it just fine.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  They're coming for you next.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  This is a technocracy.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  They're emerging with big pharma.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  They're taking over the media.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  This is a digital psychological dictatorship in their own words.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  This is a planetary takeover.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  They're then going to start locking us in our houses using supposed plague threats.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  That's so the wireless system can come into place with the driverless cars and the robot takeover.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  How did I know all this would happen?
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Because they've been saying they're going to do it.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  You see, it's not that I'm psychic.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  I know how to read what these monsters are saying.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  So you have to understand, as crazy as all this sounds, it doesn't come from me.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  It comes from them.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  There's a man going around, taking names, and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  There'll be a golden letter reaching down.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  You know, Trump is re-elected. It's going to be the man coming around, folks.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  We're going to be taking action as well.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  The hairs on your arm will stand up.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  The left said they're going to persecute us, take our speech, put us in prison.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  We're not going to take their speech.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  We're going to put them up on the stand in front of a jury of their peers.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  We're going to convict them.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  We're going to send them to prison.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  The man, I'm sorry.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  All right, I want to give the number out and take calls.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-8789-2539, 877-8789.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  Alex, specifically on last night's debate, what did you think of it?
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  I thought it was devastating.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  And yeah, it was somewhat rigged, and she interrupted Trump more.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  But it was like, you know, barely rigged.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Not like just ridiculous like Chris Wallace or the town hall.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  Those were like cartoon level, and the system knew it backfired.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  Those debates hurt the system.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  But last night, Trump was so real, so on his feet, and just getting on a level of just genuineness.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  Like really hitting the stride.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  He's a very genuine person, but sometimes he overdoes it just like I do or you do.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  He was just like, you know what, I love this country.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  I'm going to do a good job.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  I've done a good job.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  You're a monster, and I can't believe you're up here.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  And then Biden was just saying the most insane stuff like, you put kids in cages.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  My God, that's been debunked for three years.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  That was Biden and Obama.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  Simply incredible that they would try stuff like that.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  Let's go to the clip where again, Biden says, I've never taken money from a foreign country.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's on record after he was vice president being a foreign lobbyist.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  That's just on its face a lot, but he meant in the way Trump's saying, oh no, you mean all those payoffs?
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  Oh no, those went to your brothers and your sons, your dirty family.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  So go ahead and roll it.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  Here it is.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  I've learned that this president paid 50 times the tax in China as a secret bank account with China does business in China.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  And in fact, is talking about me taking money.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  I have not taken a single penny from any country.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  What so ever.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  So Trump went on to explain that we open a business there.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  Never got off the ground.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  It was closed in 2015.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  Incredible.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  Meanwhile, who is the big guy Hunter Biden refers to in lucrative China pitch that interested him and his family and they took the money.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  So the House of Cards is coming down.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  Now, what clip should I go to next?
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Yeah, let's go to the one.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  Let's go to the one where he talks about kids in cages.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  Because that really says it all.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Number 16.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Let's go ahead and roll this in and it went on and on.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  So I can't play the whole thing, but Trump hitting my counted last night five times with you put him in the cages.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  I got rid of the cages.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  You're a liar.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  Those photos are with Obama and the media.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  Biden should be done right there, but the media will not call him on that.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  Here it is.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  Parents and it makes us a laughing stock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  Let me ask you a question.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  They did it.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  We changed the policy.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  Your response to that.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  We did not.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  They built the cages.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  They built the cages.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Joe, let's talk about who built the cages.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  Let's talk about what we're talking about.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  What happened?
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  Parents were ripped.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  Nowhere to go.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  Nowhere to go.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  It's criminal.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  It's criminal.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  Let me.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  The Trump goes into what's criminal is millions of people trying to bring their kids up here.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  But in most cases, the kids go over dozens of times and are using the human shield to get them in.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  That's on record.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  It turns out the 500 aren't kids that they didn't find their parents.
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  That's not true.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  It was children kidnapped so young that when they took them from smugglers, they don't know who their parents are.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  And who allowed that?
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  Who said, bring kids and you get in.
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  Barack Obama 10 years ago.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  And of course, there's an infowars.com article.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  Liberals are so stupid.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  Leftists are so disconnected from reality.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  They've never been on a farm or ranch.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  They thought that Trump meant children were riding on coyotes.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  When I saw that last night, I said, they said, oh my God, that's the name of human smugglers is a coyote.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Put that headline back up.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  That is so crazy.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  The blue checkmarks are like, he's crazy.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  Coyotes don't bring kids into the United States.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  People do.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  That's what they're called.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  You dumb bastards.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  See, you leftists are the dumb idiots, not the military that Biden called dumb bastards to their face.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  You know, Trump calls them dumb bastards behind their back.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  And it's like, wait, that's exactly what you call them.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  I mean, these people are incredible folks.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  Let me see that headline again.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  That's, that's amazing.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  And then scroll through some of the tweets there for TV viewers.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  But just imagine liberal politicians, journalists and blue checkmarks thought Trump meant actual coyotes are smuggling children across the border.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  Scroll through that.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  It's a calamity brain article.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  Wow.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  After President Trump said coyotes, they thought it was an actual animal, an actual canine.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  The man said coyotes.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  And they say, oh, he's completely insane.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Wow, he's crazy.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  Wow.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  Gosh, think about how dumb these people are because they grow up in high rise buildings.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  They go working a pod at Big Tech.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  They drink Starbucks coffee.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  And I mean, listen, I love New Yorkers and a lot of New Yorkers have been in the military and they've lived here and they know stuff.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  They work in New Yorkers.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  But when you get around the trust fund kids, you get around the LA trust fund kids, they think in Texas, we have outhouses and ride horses to work.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  People get to like, what the hell?
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  Texas has like spacecraft and rocket launching bases and super, super gliders and giant factories and what the hell's going on here?
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  Because they think if you have a Texas accent or a Southern accent, you have a low IQ.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  Again, that's idiocy.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  I don't think if somebody has a New Yorker accent, they're stupid.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  Now, they're a young trust fund kid.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  They probably are very, very stupid.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  So how did those coyotes get all those kids past the wall?
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  It's got Wiley coyote from Warner Brothers.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  And they're also stupid.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  None of them even know what fools they are.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  See, that's the thing about an invincible mass of idiocy.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  Invincible ignorance is a term I coined 20 something years ago.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  They're so ignorant.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  You can't even get through to them and they love whatever the BS is so bad that they never understand how they were wrong.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  And Trump even said, you know, the coyotes, the smugglers.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  In fact, guys, there's a fuller clip of that.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Get Trump's full response to kids and cages.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  I want to play that.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  I want to play where he says coyotes, you know, the smugglers.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  He even knows they're that stupid.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  He even goes, oh, I just use a technical term.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  They won't know what that is.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  Wow.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  Wow.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  Wow.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  Wow.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Wow.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Wow.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  Wow.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  We just, just wow.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  And he goes on and on.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  We've got so many other clips.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  I want to take your calls and I want to get into the next big shoot a drop of the next big balloon to go up the next red flag, all these whistleblowers that are in the emails coming out about Hunter Biden and the big guy involved in absolute bribery.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  Well, both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com just two weeks after the election and we're offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple Patriot points to your next order.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Also, if you sign up for auto shipping additional 10% off, that makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  Now we have had a big clearance bill going.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  So a lot of stuff sold out while the other stuff is close to selling out.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  Some of our best sellers are still there and some of them have actually come back in to stock.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the other things that have actually sold out.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  So those should be back in stock as well soon.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the year.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  Obviously, we're critical of the fight and you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  In fiction, super villains are known as super villains because they have gigantic huge global plants that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  And I've told you a year ago back in October 2019 that a powerful billionaire who controls the UN would roll out a global hysteria and lock down the planet.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  Start millions of people and would be pushing a forced inoculation to even be able to leave your houses and that this same billionaire would say we're all going to work from home now
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  and that this was good to lower the carbon footprint and the human population.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  You tell me that's crazy. You tell me that's a dystopia. You tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  But in reality, it really did happen.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  His name is Bill Gates and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father and mother set up more than 60 years ago.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built. Until we start saying no, we are Bill Gates's property. It's time to expose Bill Gates.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  COVID rollout has been extremely well planned, very well thought out and has been incrementally orchestrated.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  First it's 15 days to keep the hospitals empty. That's all I did. It's two months and it's six months and it's a year. Now Bill Gates has 10 years.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  And people are not saying I like my mask. I like my face diaper. I like my being key.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  And so getting into the fear, getting into the hysteria, getting into all the exaggerated death numbers.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  This is our new neurotic control freak society overseen by robots, overseen by AI, and all of it is designed to make humans non-essential.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  That's why out of the Gates they tell us, you are non-essential. You are non-essential. Your company, your restaurant, your job, your profession is non-essential.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated and Bill Gates sits on top of it. Come on folks, let's reject this.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, very, very honored and pleased to be here with you today.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  Here is again the coyote smuggler clip.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  But the left mainstream news, everyone is saying Trump says wild dogs or a diminutive form of wolf that is in North America, the coyote, is actually taking children across.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  He thought storks deliver children. Now wolves deliver children. I guess in Little Red Riding Hood they try to eat children.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  When everybody knows, I thought everybody knew that meant a smuggler. Here's what the president actually said.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4,000 kids.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  So how will these families ever be reunited?
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and they used to use them to get into our country.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  We now have as strong a border as we've ever had, we're over 400 miles of brand new wall.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  You see the numbers and we let people in, but they have to come in legally and they come in through.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  But how will you reunite these kids with their families, Mr. President?
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  They built cages, you know, they used to say, I built the cages and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  And it was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, look at these cages, President Trump built them.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  Yes, we're working on it very, we're trying very hard, but a lot of these kids come out without the parents.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  They come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  Quick response and then another question to you.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  People claiming to be, and most of the time it wasn't true, they're kidnapped kids from south of Mexico a lot of times,
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  that they use over and over again, man.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Man goes, hey, man, hey, man, you're the liar.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  And a bunch of them got smuggled in it up dead.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  And then it's on your hands and your dirty, filthy family.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  I love how he talks like he's going to beat Trump's ass.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  How about we let those two have a cage fight, both give them baseball bats.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  I'm so sick of these lying pieces of crap, man.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  Oh, but we want to keep Hunter and Joe alive, long enough to stand trial, don't we?
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  We don't want anything to happen to hair on their chinny chin chin.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  We play a few more clubs.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  I'm going to get your calls.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Let's just play these back to back.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  They're all amazing.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  President Trump officially brings up emails, found Hunter Biden's laptop,
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  and then Trump hits Biden on profits from China and Ukraine, which are not alleged.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  It's all right there.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  These are his emails.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  The witnesses have come forward that have the other copies on the other end.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  Here it is.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  But you were getting a lot of money from Russia.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  But now with what came out today, it's even worse.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in,
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  you and your family.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  And I think you owe an explanation to the American people.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  Why is it?
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  Somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  But what he said was damning.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  Maybe you can do it right now.
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  Make money from China?
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  You do.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  I don't make money from Ukraine.
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  You do.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  I don't make money from Russia.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man.
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  You're the big man, I think.
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  I don't know.
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  Maybe you're not.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  But you're the big man, I think.
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  Your son said we have to give 10% to the big man.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  Joe, what's that all about?
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  It's terrible.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  He just destroyed him.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  And then Biden just lied.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  I've never gotten any foreign money.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  It just, all right, let's go to your phone calls and then coming up.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  I've got the really cryptic clip where he says, oh, you mean Operation Dark Winner.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  He's talking about COVID and Biden, who's living 20 years ago, brings up a U.N.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  U.S. Global Tabletop exercise for global martial law, which was the precursor model
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  of lockstep and then now COVID-19 Operation Dark Winner, which is a very cryptic
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  threat at a false flag.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  And it's also connected to nuclear war when they use the term Dark Winner.
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  Because you get so much dust off the air.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  It causes many ice age.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  So very, very cryptic.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  Okay.
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  Queen of Conspiracy was left online at the end of the show yesterday.
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  We called her back.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  Let me show her then Mike in England.
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  Queen of Conspiracy.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  Now, what do you want to talk about today?
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  Well, hi, Alex.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  And thank you so much for taking my call.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  I've been listening to you since the late 90s.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  And I've always listened, but I never called in.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  And I'm in Pennsylvania.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  So I wanted to say that everywhere you go in Lackawanna, Luzern County, it's all Trump's
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  signs.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  But it was like that.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  It was like that in 2016, but yet somehow Lackawanna went blue.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  It's a mystery.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  But anyway, I wanted to ask you what your thoughts were on the 20th Amendment, where
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:01.000]  basically the Democratic states, all they have to do is not certify the vote.
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:03.000]  Well, that's their whole plan.
[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  And they've said they won't.
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:07.000]  And Pelosi can lead that and launch it at the state level.
[1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  And they tried to not seat Trump before.
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  You would hope that the Supreme Court would step in and stop it, which is pretty much
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  what's going to end up happening.
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  It's just that in that interim, the globalists, the Chinese are already targeting the power
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  grid, they're already targeting the infrastructure, the cyber infrastructure.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  And they're attacking Americans, just like we would, carpet bomb the Nazis in response
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  to their carpet bombing of London.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  They're just attacking everything.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  It's not just, we're not just attacked every day by the Chinese.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  I mean, like a half billion attacks at a time.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  I mean, they're unprecedented level of attacks right out of China.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  They're not even hiding where it comes from.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  They're hitting everything.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  I mean, they're hitting power plants.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  They're hitting local businesses.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  They're just savaging us right now ahead of whatever's coming because I believe all of
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  these attacks are probes and they're testing systems to see what's effective.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  It just blows my mind that all the top alphabet agencies at the top, nothing's being done.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  That's because they took them in the last 50 years and put them in there to not go after
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  real crime.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  So they created a lap dog, a lap dog system.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  And that's why these people are unable to respond to a real enemy because they're trained
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  to lay down.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Does that make sense?
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  Well, what does Trump do though?
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  How do we take our country back before we reach a point, a past point of no return?
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  It seems like that's where we're headed.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Well, you've done it, ma'am.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  You've supported us.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  I don't know how long we're on air.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  We have a huge effect.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  Other independent groups do.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  And we've taken the power in our own hands and are not just sitting back and letting
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  the corrupt outside system do this.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  And so you vote, you speak out, you say no.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  And if they kill the president or turn it into a hot war, then God knows we're going
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  to have to study total resistance and carry it out.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.500]  So we're not the ones that did this or the ones started it.
[1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:51.500]  I'm not looking for a fight.
[1:34:51.500 --> 1:34:53.000]  Believe me, I don't want one.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  But if they're looking for a fight, they came the right place.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  That we have you.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  I know you don't like being, you know, thanked, but you're there.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  Well, I thank God I'm here because of you.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  It's like the gravity of the sun holds earth in place.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  Well, you guys are the sun.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  So it's just, I love you.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  I want you to know how important you are.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  It's not about kissing your butt either.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  It's about understanding.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  The listeners are the sun.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:17.500]  You're the big enchilada.
[1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:20.000]  I'm just a little orbiting thing out here.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  And all I do is ping messages back.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  You're already thinking.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  That's all I do.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  I'm willing.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  I'm willing because I wanted to.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  I volunteered for this.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  I believed in you.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  I believe that we would defeat globalism if we sold freedom up against it.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  And it's happening.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  And so I'm fabulously pleased.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  I'm willing to die for this right now.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  I don't want to, but so just I'm just very happy.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  I just don't want people to think this is some great thing to do this.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  This is what you're supposed to do.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  Like you see a kid run on the road.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  You go stop and get run over.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  Thank you so much, ma'am.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  I appreciate your call.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  Again, if you see a three year old because mom had a stroke or fell asleep or hasn't
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  epilepsy, whatever it is, mom or dad, you know, was watching the kid passes out and
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  the two year old wanders out the street.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  That stuff happens.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  And it's happened to family of mine that's gone out and saved the kid or whatever.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  I mean, I saved a lady choking one time.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  Wasn't I was a hero?
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  I knew the Heimlich maneuver.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  I took it and swim team, you know, they had the fire department come into a two day course
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  and I learned it when I was 12 years old.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  And I mean, I knew it and no one would help her.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  She's dying.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  She's turning purple.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  She's got bread in her throat and they're going call 911 like parrots.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  And I said, get out of the way there.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  No, sir, you're not medically trained.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  This is the name.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  I go, yeah, I am.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  I grabbed the lady and caught the thing up out of her and she would have probably died.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  I wasn't a hero.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  I was competent.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  I was engaged.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  I was informed.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  I wasn't a spectator.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  But those people that all said don't help her, you know, they're all masquies right now.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  They love the little diapers.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  And the globalist controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against them.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  The whole planet is a huge populace for alignment.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  And so they've openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  but physically attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  This is what all the old Clintinesias are saying.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  It's what the Obama bots are saying.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  It's what Keith Overman saying.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  It's what Nancy Pelosi saying.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and force binoculations.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying vaccines will be voluntary.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Donald Trump or die.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  We've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote and tell your family to vote now.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  Black Friday in October.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  Last year, that was one of our most popular sales that we ran in the last couple weeks of October.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  It was popular for a reason.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  And that means 30 to 60% off, store-wide free shipping, triple-patriot points.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  That's 15% off your next order.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  And everybody that signs up for auto shipping additional 10% off, that makes many of these items lost leaders.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  Now, a lot of stuff sold out.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Some of our best sellers are still there.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  But some good news.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all other vitamins and minerals and amino acids for adults and children
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  that boost your body's natural defenses.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  It is back in stock, back on sale today, with just two weeks of the election.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  And more good news.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  Ultra 12, it's got the name Ultra for a reason.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Highest quality vitamin B12, take it under the tongue for full absorption.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  It is now back in stock.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Both of those are 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Black Friday comes in October.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment understands what Info Wars understands,
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  what our listeners understand, what Donald Trump understands.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  We're in a digital civil war.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  There are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication going on on every major tech platform.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  And now they're doing it to the private apps.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  They're doing it to text messages.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  They're doing it to email.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  This is mafia organized crime election meddling.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  But finally, when they blocked the Hunter Biden and the barisma information and the Chinese information
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  and the photos of the crack pipes and all the rest of it, it's been confirmed to be real.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  Biden hasn't denied it.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  Finally, Congress got pissed and said, this is out of control.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  You've got to stop it now.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  We're taking action.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  Oh, and Jack Dorsey went, oh, what's a mistake?
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  It's an accident.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  It's an accident.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  But they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  Well, Info Wars is calling their bluff.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  And I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  I'm going to share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  And then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  This is the global Chinese Communist Social Credit score.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks, infowarstore.com.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  Okay, let's try to jam in a lot of calls right now.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  Mike in England and Jesse Bryan, resistance, Renaissance and Bob.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  And then yes, there's a lot of breaking news I haven't gotten to yet.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  We'll just do that next hour and then continue with calls.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  And Catherine Austin Fitz, it was really informative.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  She was on a few weeks ago.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  So I want to get her back on to expand more on what's unfolding, get her take on the debate and play some more of those clips as well.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  There's been another video that just came out.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  It's on infowarstore.com.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  In Pence video, cop shoots black man drawing presumed weapon in San Bernardino.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  There'll probably be riots over that.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  Even a black cop shoots a black guy pulls a gun on him.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  There's riots.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  It's just, it's crazy because it creates the perception of man, all the black men are being gunned down because about once a month I see it on TV.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  You know, people die a day in car wrecks in a city like LA with like 30, 40.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  I mean, it's just, it's just crazy.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  And I'm not saying it's good when a cop shoots somebody.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  But the latest footage is it looks like he's pulling a weapon.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  What about when the black guy comes after the cop with a knife and is trying to stab him and people still rioted?
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  Or the black guy shoots the white guy, the cop, the woman calls the black lady, calls the cops, he's beating her.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  He goes in the house, the guy shoots the cop, the guy shoots him back and then they still riot it.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  It's just a mess out there, man.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  You could not get me to be a police officer.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  Period.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  It's always been a tough job, but it's just, just, I mean, God almighty.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Talk about, because I mean, now if you shoot somebody and there's any question about it.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  You're going to prison if you're a cop.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  I mean, I mean, here's the deal.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  We've all been in fights for most of us have.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  I had a dog bite me not too bad because I caught it right as it was doing it a few weeks ago.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  And I got mad.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  And I kind of wasn't thinking once I punched the dog in the face a few times and, you know, basically threatened to kick the guy's ass.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  He was smart enough.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  And I was like, God, why did I do that?
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  Because it was the heat of the moment.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  I mean, I, I don't have those controls.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  And I just could not be a cop.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  The way they control themselves in situations is incredible.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  I guess it's the training, but and the danger every time people call you to their house where the husband and wife are fighting and breaking stuff.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  And then you, and then you're the bad guy.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  And you see where they like call the cops.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  It's going to call the cops if they're Wendy's hamburger in the hot and the cops will show up for that because by law they have to.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  All right, I'm going to stop ranting.
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  I said, I'll take your calls.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  Mike in England, you saw the debate last night.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  What did you think of it?
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  Well, hi, Alex.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  When we want you to know we love you and there's so many people that do love you and thanks for the stickers.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Trump did win last night.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  Yes, he wiped the floor with him, but it's not going to matter.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  Not if 100% of the patriots don't get out and physically vote.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  And the reason is I got about three or four points and they're all very pertinent.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  We got a constitutional crisis for both of the candidates.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  Biden is just not eligible for security clearance.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  So, I mean, they got a problem on that.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  No one's talking about that.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  He's not eligible for security clearance whatsoever right now.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  The man is an absolute disaster.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  I mean, the amount of crime he's committed is unbelievable.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  I mean, he mixed the crimes on TV.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  Yeah.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  Harris, with the debate with Pence, she admitted that she's ineligible to be president.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  I don't know if he caught it.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  She said, well, my mom moved here.
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  And then two years later, I was born.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  If your mom's not born here, you got a problem.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  Yeah.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  So she's ineligible.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  So they've got a train wreck all together.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  Everybody must get out and physically vote.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  The reason is, you know why they have.
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  She was in another country and then they moved here.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  Wow.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  That's amazing.
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  Yeah.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  So she admitted on international television that she's not eligible.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  People may not understand it, but I'm here in England and I understand it because I have
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  my children.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  I know the details on that.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  So she's ineligible.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  So why are they stupid enough to put a train wreck for both of those on the ballot?
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  It's because they're so arrogant.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  They got away with murder for so long under Bush senior, under the Clintons, under all
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  of it.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  They got away with like 30 years of 40 years of whatever they wanted.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  So they just, they're just not accustomed to ever having any opposition.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  And so that's why they've screwed the pooch.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  And now they've got big tech and the media all censoring, all ganged up and it's not
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  working and it's showing they're not as powerful as they thought they were.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  What was your other point, Mike?
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  Yeah, they're stupid.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  Yeah, everybody's got to get out and physically vote.
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  The reason why we're finding so many ballots that are being trashed, legitimate ballots
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  is because they have to make room for all the fake fraudulent ballots.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  So when they're stealing them, there's a purpose to it.
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  And by the way, I wasn't as smart as the old people who figured this out.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  I had this explained to me last week, old folks figured out, oh, I got to go physically
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  vote because the reason they sent out 80 million was when I mail mine in and absentee, they're
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  going to throw it away and forge my name.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  Yeah.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  And I don't know why Trump isn't using the 14th amendment because it's gone past.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  I mean, they've made their intent clear that like you say, this is war and the stakes are
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  high.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  And I know you don't shoot till you see the whites of their eyes, but it's getting a
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  little bit close.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  And the fraud and the vote rigging is so...
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  I agree.
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  It's too dangerous to wait after the election to indict all these people.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  This is absolutely high stakes, sudden death overkill.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  And I mean, everybody better be praying.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  So when I say, hey, it's great.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  Trump won the debate.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  America's behind him.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  But he's got to get past the fraud now.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  But I just saw that cherry on top.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  I could feel the spirit of America moving even closer to Trump.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  You've got all these big black icons coming out saying they're going to endorse Trump
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  because they just know.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  They know Trump's not against him.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  They know Trump's trying to help everybody.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  And it's just time for folks to have some damn courage.
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  That's why I've got stacks of articles every day.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  I don't even have time to hit where you'll have somebody kicked out of college because
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  they support Trump or somebody fired because they support Trump.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  Where's the civil right there that you support the president?
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  So you're fired?
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  I mean, I had a bank account.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  I can talk about this now and I appreciate your call sir.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  God bless Mike.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  It's been 20 years.
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Okay.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  I had my children's private bank accounts on there.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Tut my accounts.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Education accounts.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  Not a lot of money, but some money for college or if they want to go for medical stuff.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  And they called up and they said, yeah, we don't want to be associated with you because
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  you're with Trump.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  And I went in to close my main bank account and they go, oh, no, no, no, no.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  We don't want a relationship with you.
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  We want your children's accounts closed.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  So talk about Nazi Germany.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  My children can't have bank accounts.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  My children in America in 2000, when I was three years old, they said, no, we do not
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  want a relationship with you or your family.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  I said, well, thanks for telling me that that bank would put me in a concentration camp
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  like that, folks.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  I mean, when they're telling you, we don't want your children's money.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  Where are you?
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:30.500]  14th Amendment allows the president to strip electoral college votes from states supporting
[1:48:30.500 --> 1:48:33.000]  censorship against voters.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  Tables mass arrests of mayors, governors and judges support BLM.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  Yeah, it's true.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  That's a bunch of Lincoln stuff, but that's where they're taking us.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  Yep.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Jesse in Missouri.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  Jesse, you're on the air.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  Welcome.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:54.300]  I wasn't even going to call in until you did the man comes around thing there.
[1:48:54.300 --> 1:48:56.300]  He loved to have you, brother.
[1:48:56.300 --> 1:48:57.300]  Go ahead.
[1:48:57.300 --> 1:48:58.300]  Yeah.
[1:48:58.300 --> 1:48:59.300]  You know, Trump knocked it out of the park last night.
[1:48:59.300 --> 1:49:00.300]  Home run after home run.
[1:49:00.300 --> 1:49:03.300]  And Playdress Joe was Playdress Joe.
[1:49:03.300 --> 1:49:06.300]  He did that in his campaigns in the 80s.
[1:49:06.300 --> 1:49:08.300]  He's well known for that Biden care.
[1:49:08.300 --> 1:49:10.300]  I mean, come on.
[1:49:10.300 --> 1:49:12.300]  He is so empty.
[1:49:12.300 --> 1:49:14.300]  It's hard to believe, isn't it?
[1:49:14.300 --> 1:49:15.300]  Yes, absolutely.
[1:49:15.300 --> 1:49:18.300]  You know, and he could have been an American leader.
[1:49:18.300 --> 1:49:19.300]  He could have been somebody instead.
[1:49:19.300 --> 1:49:24.200]  He runs around chasing money just for money as if his money will be worth it.
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:25.200]  That's anything of the country.
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:27.200]  He's your crazy people.
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:33.200]  All the people have to do YouTube search Joe Biden Playdress and watch the top video.
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:34.200]  I've shared it so many times.
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:42.700]  It covers it all, but Trump damn well better do what we all know that he should have done
[1:49:42.700 --> 1:49:43.700]  already.
[1:49:43.700 --> 1:49:49.500]  You know, that's I've been on the train since day one, never faltered, never wavered, but
[1:49:49.500 --> 1:49:51.200]  we want him locked up and he better do it.
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:54.020]  Well, when he gets reelected, he says, and I believe him.
[1:49:54.020 --> 1:49:56.020]  He's firing bar and he's firing.
[1:49:56.020 --> 1:49:58.020]  I mean, he's firing him.
[1:49:58.020 --> 1:50:01.020]  Yeah, but we don't have a recourse.
[1:50:01.020 --> 1:50:04.020]  Like did he wait this long to help his reelection?
[1:50:04.020 --> 1:50:05.020]  I mean, I don't understand.
[1:50:05.020 --> 1:50:07.020]  What are you waiting on?
[1:50:07.020 --> 1:50:08.020]  You're absolutely right.
[1:50:08.020 --> 1:50:10.020]  Thank you so much and God bless you.
[1:50:10.020 --> 1:50:15.020]  The videos plagiarism and Joe Biden's 1988 presidential campaign.
[1:50:15.020 --> 1:50:22.020]  I mean, he didn't just plagiarize what people said.
[1:50:22.020 --> 1:50:24.020]  He plagiarized.
[1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:26.020]  He stole identities.
[1:50:26.020 --> 1:50:30.020]  He said he was Bobby Kennedy.
[1:50:30.020 --> 1:50:37.020]  He told the same stories about Bobby Kennedy about himself, but with a different state and
[1:50:37.020 --> 1:50:38.020]  a different place.
[1:50:38.020 --> 1:50:39.020]  And none of it was true.
[1:50:39.020 --> 1:50:40.020]  None of it.
[1:50:40.020 --> 1:50:41.020]  Not not 1%.
[1:50:41.020 --> 1:50:44.020]  I mean, this guy is the father of lies.
[1:50:44.020 --> 1:50:45.020]  He's he's a devil.
[1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:48.020]  He's a lazy, cheating piece of crap.
[1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:50.020]  And I don't normally just meet out insults.
[1:50:50.020 --> 1:50:58.020]  I mean, Joe Biden is the perfect or typal example of an empty fraud.
[1:50:58.020 --> 1:51:01.020]  And if you follow him, that's what you'll get with Trump.
[1:51:01.020 --> 1:51:03.020]  I know why Trump did everything he's done.
[1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:06.020]  I would have with my deep knowledge of this.
[1:51:06.020 --> 1:51:07.020]  And I'm just I do it all the time.
[1:51:07.020 --> 1:51:09.020]  I do have deep knowledge for most people.
[1:51:09.020 --> 1:51:11.020]  I would.
[1:51:11.020 --> 1:51:16.020]  I would have made basically the same decision as Trump made minus some of the Machiavellian
[1:51:16.020 --> 1:51:18.020]  stuff, which is work like a charm.
[1:51:18.020 --> 1:51:20.020]  I mean, he derailed their whole gun thing doing that.
[1:51:20.020 --> 1:51:21.020]  Everybody's still pissed at him.
[1:51:21.020 --> 1:51:23.020]  But I know what he did.
[1:51:23.020 --> 1:51:26.020]  He reached out and told me what he did.
[1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:28.020]  So it's just I it's incredible.
[1:51:28.020 --> 1:51:29.020]  It's unbelievable.
[1:51:29.020 --> 1:51:33.020]  I mean, Trump's a Jedi master.
[1:51:33.020 --> 1:51:38.020]  We're right back with our number three in your phone calls.
[1:51:38.020 --> 1:51:42.020]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:51:42.020 --> 1:51:46.020]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:51.020]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[1:51:51.020 --> 1:51:55.020]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:51:55.020 --> 1:52:00.020]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:52:00.020 --> 1:52:06.020]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[1:52:06.020 --> 1:52:11.020]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:52:11.020 --> 1:52:18.020]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:52:18.020 --> 1:52:23.020]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:52:23.020 --> 1:52:29.020]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[1:52:29.020 --> 1:52:31.020]  facts that pertain to reality.
[1:52:31.020 --> 1:52:38.020]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.

[1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:47.020]  the top some already amazing sales.

[1:52:54.020 --> 1:52:59.020]  We can only do it for 11 days till the end of the month because stocks are low in a lot
[1:52:59.020 --> 1:53:00.020]  of our best-selling products.

[1:53:38.020 --> 1:54:07.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:07.020 --> 1:54:09.020]  Back in black.
[1:54:09.020 --> 1:54:14.020]  America's gonna go back in the black as soon as we get Trump re-elected and defeat the
[1:54:14.020 --> 1:54:15.020]  marvelous one-sided deals.
[1:54:15.020 --> 1:54:16.020]  Back in black.
[1:54:16.020 --> 1:54:18.020]  I hate this land.
[1:54:18.020 --> 1:54:19.020]  I've been too long.
[1:54:19.020 --> 1:54:20.020]  I'm glad to be a bank.
[1:54:20.020 --> 1:54:21.020]  Yes, I am.
[1:54:21.020 --> 1:54:23.020]  We got news from the news.
[1:54:23.020 --> 1:54:25.020]  That's kept me hanging around.
[1:54:25.020 --> 1:54:27.020]  I keep a million other jobs.
[1:54:27.020 --> 1:54:28.020]  It's giving me high.
[1:54:28.020 --> 1:54:30.020]  I got the best cause I'll never die.
[1:54:30.020 --> 1:54:33.020]  All right, Brian, Renaissance and Bob, you're up next.
[1:54:33.020 --> 1:54:38.020]  But I had to have Catherine Austin-Fitz back on, former high-level official of the administration
[1:54:38.020 --> 1:54:39.020]  in HUD.
[1:54:39.020 --> 1:54:41.020]  I mean, she's super uber smart.
[1:54:41.020 --> 1:54:46.020]  Probably one of the smartest people I know and looking at this whole COVID rollout, this
[1:54:46.020 --> 1:54:50.020]  global takeover, how to oppose it, how to fight it, her take on the election, last night's
[1:54:50.020 --> 1:54:52.020]  debate and more, earned just a few minutes.
[1:54:52.020 --> 1:54:55.020]  But Brian in New Hampshire, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:54:55.020 --> 1:54:56.020]  Welcome.
[1:54:56.020 --> 1:54:57.020]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[1:54:57.020 --> 1:54:58.020]  Good to be on the air.
[1:54:58.020 --> 1:54:59.020]  It's good to be here, brother.
[1:54:59.020 --> 1:55:00.020]  What's on your mind?
[1:55:00.020 --> 1:55:02.020]  Hey, I just want to start out with something a little different.
[1:55:02.020 --> 1:55:03.020]  I've been listening to what you've been saying.
[1:55:03.020 --> 1:55:05.020]  Everybody's saying thank you and stuff.
[1:55:05.020 --> 1:55:09.020]  I wanted to throw a big thank you out there to the resistance, my fellow Patriots.
[1:55:09.020 --> 1:55:10.020]  Yes.
[1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:11.020]  Thank you for keeping us online.
[1:55:11.020 --> 1:55:13.020]  We'd be nothing without all of us.
[1:55:13.020 --> 1:55:15.020]  We're all a team together.
[1:55:15.020 --> 1:55:17.020]  We're going to take down these damn globalists.
[1:55:17.020 --> 1:55:21.020]  Secondly, I just want to talk about last night, Trump came on the stage and he was an absolute
[1:55:21.020 --> 1:55:22.020]  Titan on the stage.
[1:55:22.020 --> 1:55:24.020]  He was crushing Joe Biden.
[1:55:24.020 --> 1:55:29.020]  Every time he said something, every time he blew him out in the open of all his lies
[1:55:29.020 --> 1:55:32.020]  and everything, he just stayed on the stage.
[1:55:32.020 --> 1:55:35.020]  He has nothing to say, never has anything to say.
[1:55:35.020 --> 1:55:36.020]  At this point.
[1:55:36.020 --> 1:55:37.020]  That's right.
[1:55:37.020 --> 1:55:39.020]  I mean, Biden's BS got totally called last night.
[1:55:39.020 --> 1:55:40.020]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[1:55:40.020 --> 1:55:44.020]  He was calling him and this is the Trump that we've been wanting to see this whole time
[1:55:44.020 --> 1:55:47.020]  with the first debate up until this point.
[1:55:47.020 --> 1:55:49.020]  This is what he needed to come out with.
[1:55:49.020 --> 1:55:50.020]  He's been blasting him lately.
[1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:52.020]  Well, it's the same story.
[1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:56.020]  He got pressured to be Mr. Nice Guy four years ago and lost the first couple of debates and
[1:55:56.020 --> 1:55:57.020]  won the third.
[1:55:57.020 --> 1:55:59.020]  He gets your repeats.
[1:55:59.020 --> 1:56:00.020]  Trump's the same way.
[1:56:00.020 --> 1:56:01.020]  He told his advisor, shut up.
[1:56:01.020 --> 1:56:02.020]  This has been confirmed.
[1:56:02.020 --> 1:56:03.020]  I'm going after him.
[1:56:03.020 --> 1:56:06.020]  And they said, oh, sir, people won't like it if you attack.
[1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:07.020]  Be nice.
[1:56:07.020 --> 1:56:08.020]  Be nice.
[1:56:08.020 --> 1:56:09.020]  They're attacking you.
[1:56:09.020 --> 1:56:10.020]  Fight back.
[1:56:10.020 --> 1:56:11.020]  Absolutely.
[1:56:11.020 --> 1:56:15.020]  And that's where it comes in with the, you know, my generation of people is getting weaker
[1:56:15.020 --> 1:56:18.020]  and weaker and it's disgusting.
[1:56:18.020 --> 1:56:23.220]  We need a leader who can hammer down, strap down and take on these global fed on and come
[1:56:23.220 --> 1:56:26.020]  out and tell everybody the truth and blow it out all in the open.
[1:56:26.020 --> 1:56:27.020]  This is what we want.
[1:56:27.020 --> 1:56:31.020]  We don't want a bunch of nice guy lies and pitter-patter around and all this junk.
[1:56:31.020 --> 1:56:34.020]  Trump's like, oh, everybody's around the table.
[1:56:34.020 --> 1:56:35.020]  Oh, you love America.
[1:56:35.020 --> 1:56:37.020]  Well, you sell us out to China.
[1:56:37.020 --> 1:56:38.020]  Exactly.
[1:56:38.020 --> 1:56:39.020]  He said, I'm going to be fake with people.
[1:56:39.020 --> 1:56:41.020]  And, you know, and Trump's riding the tiger.
[1:56:41.020 --> 1:56:43.020]  He's, he's, he's playing their game.
[1:56:43.020 --> 1:56:45.020]  We'll talk about it with Catherine Austin Fitz coming up.
[1:56:45.020 --> 1:56:46.020]  He's not perfect.
[1:56:46.020 --> 1:56:48.020]  I mean, he understands he can't go against all these forces.
[1:56:48.020 --> 1:56:52.020]  He can't go against a lot of these forces because the people are so dumbed down, but
[1:56:52.020 --> 1:56:55.020]  that's the process of this is changing.
[1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:56.020]  Thank you, Brian.
[1:56:56.020 --> 1:57:00.020]  Renaissance in New York, the Pito networks and the election debate.
[1:57:00.020 --> 1:57:01.020]  Thank you for holding.
[1:57:01.020 --> 1:57:02.020]  Go ahead.
[1:57:02.020 --> 1:57:03.020]  Commander Jones.
[1:57:03.020 --> 1:57:05.020]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[1:57:05.020 --> 1:57:06.020]  Yes, sir.
[1:57:06.020 --> 1:57:13.020]  Um, I was just thinking, um, you know, Eisenhower made his address about the military industrial
[1:57:13.020 --> 1:57:14.020]  complex, right?
[1:57:14.020 --> 1:57:15.020]  Yes.
[1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:20.020]  What if Trump were to come out about the compromised individual industrial complex?
[1:57:20.020 --> 1:57:21.020]  I agree.
[1:57:21.020 --> 1:57:25.020]  Eisenhower gave his military industrial complex that Trump's talked about.
[1:57:25.020 --> 1:57:26.020]  So he's against the same group.
[1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:29.020]  He should bring up the blackmail industrial complex.
[1:57:29.020 --> 1:57:32.020]  I think he should give that speech next week.
[1:57:32.020 --> 1:57:33.020]  Absolutely.
[1:57:33.020 --> 1:57:37.020]  I think Monday night on the eve of the election, he should give that speech.
[1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:41.020]  Hey, you know, put the word out there, frame it correctly.
[1:57:41.020 --> 1:57:47.020]  And, you know, change, you know, new nomenclature, you know, to really crystallize it as you
[1:57:47.020 --> 1:57:55.020]  like to say compromised individual industrial complex, sick, CICC sick, you know, um, put
[1:57:55.020 --> 1:57:56.020]  it out there.
[1:57:56.020 --> 1:57:58.020]  Beautiful idea.
[1:57:58.020 --> 1:58:00.020]  What's else on your mind, Renaissance?
[1:58:00.020 --> 1:58:05.520]  Well, um, the other thing is also I'd like, I thought he did good yesterday, but I'd like
[1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:08.020]  David Knight was even talking about it earlier.
[1:58:08.020 --> 1:58:10.020]  The word liberty wasn't used at all.
[1:58:10.020 --> 1:58:13.020]  So I'd like to see him push a little more for liberty.
[1:58:13.020 --> 1:58:15.020]  American liberty is well, David's right.
[1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:18.020]  I mean, I saw David show this morning, Trump should just said the federal government doesn't
[1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:21.020]  have the power to make you wear a mask or do all this.
[1:58:21.020 --> 1:58:23.020]  And it didn't have the power to keep a lockdown going.
[1:58:23.020 --> 1:58:24.020]  Yeah.
[1:58:24.020 --> 1:58:28.020]  I mean, Trump did that one area and I'm not knocking David Knight as a smart guy, but
[1:58:28.020 --> 1:58:31.020]  it's easy to Monday morning quarterback, brother.
[1:58:31.020 --> 1:58:32.020]  Yeah, no, you're right.
[1:58:32.020 --> 1:58:33.020]  You're absolutely right.
[1:58:33.020 --> 1:58:36.020]  I dropped the ball myself because more than more than one to my life.
[1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:37.020]  So yeah, definitely.
[1:58:37.020 --> 1:58:38.020]  Yeah.
[1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:40.020]  Think about Trump up there at 74.
[1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:41.020]  It's unbelievable.
[1:58:41.020 --> 1:58:42.020]  Thank you so much, brother.
[1:58:42.020 --> 1:58:43.020]  We love you.
[1:58:43.020 --> 1:58:45.020]  Thank you.
[1:58:45.020 --> 1:58:47.020]  Thank you.
[1:58:47.020 --> 1:58:50.020]  I admire President Trump.
[1:58:50.020 --> 1:58:55.020]  He's really proven himself to be unmatched in his wit, his focus, his commitment, his
[1:58:55.020 --> 1:58:56.020]  energy.
[1:58:56.020 --> 1:58:59.020]  And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump.
[1:58:59.020 --> 1:59:00.020]  He's not God.
[1:59:00.020 --> 1:59:01.020]  He's not an angel.
[1:59:01.020 --> 1:59:02.020]  He's not perfect.
[1:59:02.020 --> 1:59:09.020]  But the way he has used judo on the forces of the New World Order has been really incredible.
[1:59:09.020 --> 1:59:16.020]  The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom and the way he stood up against
[1:59:16.020 --> 1:59:21.020]  these America-hating, God-hating, family-hating trash is beautiful.
[1:59:21.020 --> 1:59:22.020]  And I'm serious.
[1:59:22.020 --> 1:59:26.020]  I was just bringing tears to my eyes, driving to work this morning thinking about President
[1:59:26.020 --> 1:59:27.020]  Trump.
[1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:32.020]  I just want to say I admire the President so much and I appreciate you, the listeners,
[1:59:32.020 --> 1:59:34.020]  and everybody for what you've done.
[1:59:34.020 --> 1:59:35.020]  I admire you.
[1:59:35.020 --> 1:59:37.020]  That's what you call it and thank me, folks.
[1:59:37.020 --> 1:59:38.020]  I admire you.
[1:59:38.020 --> 1:59:39.020]  I admire Trump.
[1:59:39.020 --> 1:59:43.020]  I admire all of you that are involved in this fight and I just wish I could do more.
[1:59:43.020 --> 1:59:44.020]  We're going to win this fight together.
[1:59:44.020 --> 1:59:45.020]  This election is so important.
[1:59:45.020 --> 2:00:12.020]  Please pray for President Trump.
[2:00:16.020 --> 2:00:18.020]  All right.
[2:00:18.020 --> 2:00:20.020]  I really appreciate Katherine Austin-Fizz.
[2:00:20.020 --> 2:00:22.020]  He's a very busy person joining us.
[2:00:22.020 --> 2:00:24.020]  I don't normally have a guest on.
[2:00:24.020 --> 2:00:27.020]  We can have him after they were on, but we only had 45 minutes with her last time and
[2:00:27.020 --> 2:00:32.020]  she ended on all these great solutions and micro-economies and people facing that there
[2:00:32.020 --> 2:00:37.020]  is a globalist takeover that plans to make you obsolete so they can control your life.
[2:00:37.020 --> 2:00:40.020]  And then if you start shifting now or there's still resources, you can build other economies.
[2:00:40.020 --> 2:00:42.020]  She's a leading expert on that.
[2:00:42.020 --> 2:00:47.020]  She has her amazing magazine and publication, the Solari Report, the state of our currencies,
[2:00:47.020 --> 2:00:52.020]  the end of currencies, the big global move to get rid of cash, to get rid of this and
[2:00:52.020 --> 2:00:53.020]  what that symbolizes.
[2:00:53.020 --> 2:00:59.020]  And I want to speak about that next segment, but I wanted to talk to her first about the
[2:00:59.020 --> 2:01:02.020]  debate, Trump, the election fraud.
[2:01:02.020 --> 2:01:04.020]  People say, well, Trump's devaluing the currency.
[2:01:04.020 --> 2:01:05.020]  Well, globally they're doing it.
[2:01:05.020 --> 2:01:07.020]  I mean, I get that.
[2:01:07.020 --> 2:01:09.020]  At least he's trying to maintain U.S. control.
[2:01:09.020 --> 2:01:11.020]  I'm not lionizing him.
[2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:16.020]  I know he's not perfect, but I wanted to ask your real opinion, I respect it, on the power
[2:01:16.020 --> 2:01:22.020]  structure and the factions and why the system hates Trump so much, but at certain levels,
[2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:24.020]  he's also driving up the stock market.
[2:01:24.020 --> 2:01:28.020]  What you really think the mechanism is behind that and other points you'd like to make, just
[2:01:28.020 --> 2:01:31.020]  about the general lay of the land 10 days out.
[2:01:31.020 --> 2:01:36.020]  Katherine Austin fits at Solari.com, S-O-L-A-R-I.com.
[2:01:36.020 --> 2:01:42.020]  It was the presence of S-O-L-A-R-I. She's managed 10s of billions, $25 billion, $300 billion
[2:01:42.020 --> 2:01:44.020]  in financial assets and liabilities.
[2:01:44.020 --> 2:01:51.020]  She graduated Pennsylvania B.A., the Wharton School, and studied Mandarin Chinese and the
[2:01:51.020 --> 2:01:54.020]  Chinese University, Hong Kong, a bunch of other degrees and all the rest.
[2:01:54.020 --> 2:01:55.020]  I'm not going to go over it all.
[2:01:55.020 --> 2:02:00.020]  And she worked high level as the Federal Housing Commissioner in the United States Department
[2:02:00.020 --> 2:02:05.020]  of Housing, Urban Development in the first Bush administration, and the Hamilton Security
[2:02:05.020 --> 2:02:08.020]  Act, which gives you a bird's eye view on how the sausage is really made.
[2:02:08.020 --> 2:02:10.020]  So good to have you again, Solari.com.
[2:02:10.020 --> 2:02:13.020]  Where do you want to start, Katherine, and thank you.
[2:02:13.020 --> 2:02:14.020]  Hi, Alex.
[2:02:14.020 --> 2:02:19.020]  So the presidency of the United States is not an entry level position, and Trump went in
[2:02:19.020 --> 2:02:24.020]  as an entrepreneur and real estate developer with no experience in governmental process,
[2:02:24.020 --> 2:02:27.020]  and he really doesn't want an experience in governmental process.
[2:02:27.020 --> 2:02:28.020]  He wanted to change things.
[2:02:28.020 --> 2:02:34.020]  So it was a shock to the system, both a system that's used to process, but also a system
[2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:37.020]  that's become very corrupt.
[2:02:37.020 --> 2:02:42.020]  And if you look at all the different people who have criminal liabilities in that system,
[2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:44.020]  you know, they got very uncomfortable.
[2:02:44.020 --> 2:02:49.020]  So when you have change, you know, when an empire starts to rock and roll and change
[2:02:49.020 --> 2:02:53.020]  at the top, you get a lot of people who are very uncomfortable.
[2:02:53.020 --> 2:02:57.020]  And if you look at the criticism of Trump, you know, I would say that some is perfectly
[2:02:57.020 --> 2:03:03.020]  reasonable and valid, and other criticism is completely not reasonable and valid.
[2:03:03.020 --> 2:03:07.020]  It's just special interests trying to protect themselves.
[2:03:07.020 --> 2:03:11.020]  And one thing I will say for Trump, he's tried very hard to keep his promises.
[2:03:11.020 --> 2:03:13.020]  You notice no new wars.
[2:03:13.020 --> 2:03:15.020]  That's pretty unusual.
[2:03:15.020 --> 2:03:18.020]  And the other thing is he started to bring transparency.
[2:03:18.020 --> 2:03:22.020]  You know, Trump has done more to inspire real conversations than anyone.
[2:03:22.020 --> 2:03:28.020]  He hasn't done as much on disclosure as we'd hoped, and his record on finances, you know,
[2:03:28.020 --> 2:03:35.020]  we saw FASB 56 occur in 2018, which has taken the government the wrong direction.
[2:03:35.020 --> 2:03:41.020]  So the, you know, the financial secrecy is skyrocketed as it's done for every administration,
[2:03:41.020 --> 2:03:44.020]  the last 10 administrations.
[2:03:44.020 --> 2:03:47.020]  So, you know, the trend continues.
[2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:49.020]  But that's beautifully said.
[2:03:49.020 --> 2:03:54.020]  He's a guy from the outside that showed how corrupt and weak the system was that if he
[2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:57.020]  supposedly retarded and dumb and an idiot, he came in and defeated all these people.
[2:03:57.020 --> 2:04:00.020]  Obviously, he's not really as bad as they say or dumb as they say.
[2:04:00.020 --> 2:04:03.020]  It really shows their weakness that he's this big idiot.
[2:04:03.020 --> 2:04:06.020]  He just totally defeated them and upended them.
[2:04:06.020 --> 2:04:12.020]  It shows their incompetence, their overconfidence in what they've done.
[2:04:12.020 --> 2:04:17.020]  Well, you know, I wouldn't describe it this way, but I think the American people are fed up
[2:04:17.020 --> 2:04:22.020]  and they want real change and his being elected in 2016 reflects that.
[2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:25.020]  I've tried to understand what's going on in the ground.
[2:04:25.020 --> 2:04:30.020]  And it's very difficult when I'm not, you know, I'm not in the United States currently.
[2:04:30.020 --> 2:04:35.020]  So it's been very hard, but from what I can tell, you know, the polls describe a totally different
[2:04:35.020 --> 2:04:41.020]  situation than what you hear from people going to the Trump rallies or showing up for the Trump events.
[2:04:41.020 --> 2:04:46.020]  There's far more enthusiasm at the grassroots for Trump right now than there appears to be
[2:04:46.020 --> 2:04:48.020]  for the Democrats from what I can tell.
[2:04:48.020 --> 2:04:52.020]  And, you know, we're just going to have to wait to see the voting.
[2:04:52.020 --> 2:04:58.020]  My concern is the mail in voting is going to be operationally such a nightmare system.
[2:04:58.020 --> 2:05:00.020]  Now, I say that I voted by mail.
[2:05:00.020 --> 2:05:06.020]  And, you know, so I've already voted, but I think we're just going to have to see what happens.
[2:05:06.020 --> 2:05:08.020]  It was very interesting on the debate.
[2:05:08.020 --> 2:05:14.020]  I did not watch the whole debate, but my favorite line of what I did see is when Trump was being criticized
[2:05:14.020 --> 2:05:18.020]  for opening up the economy, he said, well, not everybody can afford to stay in the basement.
[2:05:18.020 --> 2:05:21.020]  Exactly. That was powerful.
[2:05:21.020 --> 2:05:26.020]  That was, you know, and if you see the people who are showing up for the Trump rallies,
[2:05:26.020 --> 2:05:29.020]  they're people who, you know, do not want the economy shut down.
[2:05:29.020 --> 2:05:34.020]  Now, I have to say this, and this is one of my big criticisms in 2020.
[2:05:34.020 --> 2:05:38.020]  Trump did allow the economies to be shut down more than they had to be.
[2:05:38.020 --> 2:05:44.020]  We now see global billionaires increasing their net worth 27 percent this year.
[2:05:44.020 --> 2:05:52.020]  And in some cities, as much as 50 percent of the small business is projected to be destroyed, shut down, or bankrupt.
[2:05:52.020 --> 2:05:55.020]  That's right. You're an economist, so he went with the third way.
[2:05:55.020 --> 2:05:58.020]  They want a total complete shutdown. He said partial shutdown, but still too much.
[2:05:58.020 --> 2:06:05.020]  But we see Alibaba, we see Amazon, we see all of them making record profits in this.
[2:06:05.020 --> 2:06:10.020]  I mean, obviously they engineered this to do it as an economist. Can you speak to that?
[2:06:10.020 --> 2:06:14.020]  Well, what we're watching is centralization of the economy.
[2:06:14.020 --> 2:06:18.020]  And we watched basically a global debt entrapment.
[2:06:18.020 --> 2:06:22.020]  So you declare a whole bunch of businesses non-essential,
[2:06:22.020 --> 2:06:29.020]  and then you allow the insider businesses to take over their market share at the same time with very low cost of capital,
[2:06:29.020 --> 2:06:35.020]  you know, the Fed printing and basically directly or indirectly handing out money in a variety of ways.
[2:06:35.020 --> 2:06:42.020]  You know, that's a financial engineering which allows the insiders to take over the outsiders for cheap.
[2:06:42.020 --> 2:06:46.020]  And it's, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's a RICO conspiracy.
[2:06:46.020 --> 2:06:51.020]  I totally agree. You've got the form of three minutes. What does Trump need to do then to change this?
[2:06:51.020 --> 2:06:54.020]  What would you do if you were president to counter this right now?
[2:06:54.020 --> 2:07:00.020]  Well, the first thing I would do is I would make perfectly clear what's happening.
[2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:06.020]  You know, I would make it clear that to declare churches and small businesses non-essential,
[2:07:06.020 --> 2:07:11.020]  but liquor stores essential or, you know, Amazon and Walmart essential
[2:07:11.020 --> 2:07:16.020]  has nothing to do with health crisis. It has to do with disaster capitalism
[2:07:16.020 --> 2:07:21.020]  and basically organize crime centralizing control of the economy.
[2:07:21.020 --> 2:07:29.020]  So the first thing he could do is bring a much more obvious and blunt transparency to what is happening.
[2:07:29.020 --> 2:07:31.020]  Wow. I mean, you're a former top Bush administration official.
[2:07:31.020 --> 2:07:34.020]  You're saying COVID-19 is disaster capitalism.
[2:07:34.020 --> 2:07:36.020]  And I keep meaning to say what it is.
[2:07:36.020 --> 2:07:40.020]  Sure, it's real. It kills a few people. It's overblown. Is it a scam or fraud? No, no.
[2:07:40.020 --> 2:07:43.020]  It's disaster capitalism. You just said it.
[2:07:43.020 --> 2:07:48.020]  Well, I'm saying the dead entrapment aspect is disaster capitalism.
[2:07:48.020 --> 2:07:53.020]  I'm not saying COVID-19. Put that aside. People are sick and dying.
[2:07:53.020 --> 2:08:00.020]  But if you look at the shutdown of the economy and the rules and regulations and the way it's been engineered.
[2:08:00.020 --> 2:08:04.020]  So you're saying the response is to capitalize on that and make money off of it.
[2:08:04.020 --> 2:08:08.020]  Right. Right. And that includes the riots and the protests.
[2:08:08.020 --> 2:08:15.020]  If you look at the patterns of the riots and protests, looks to me, you know, like, you know, real estate acquisition.
[2:08:15.020 --> 2:08:23.020]  So to me, we're watching the unfolding and this started with FASB 56 in October, 2018.
[2:08:23.020 --> 2:08:31.020]  Since FASB 56 was approved in 2018, we're watching extraordinary centralization of the economy.
[2:08:31.020 --> 2:08:37.020]  And from my point of view, Trump has not done enough to stop that or bring disclosure to it.
[2:08:37.020 --> 2:08:41.020]  I agree. Well, that's his biggest failing is not busting up monopolies or big tech.
[2:08:41.020 --> 2:08:44.020]  He sure talked about it, but that's his biggest failing, in my view.
[2:08:44.020 --> 2:08:47.020]  What else is his biggest failing? What else is big?
[2:08:47.020 --> 2:08:52.020]  Well, if you look at what we're up to, you have a copy of state of our currency right now.
[2:08:52.020 --> 2:09:01.020]  What I'm seeing, you know, the central bankers agreed to the global, it's called the Going Direct Reset in August, 2019.
[2:09:01.020 --> 2:09:09.020]  And they have proceeded on five pillars to work towards a system which Christians describe as Mark of the Beast.
[2:09:09.020 --> 2:09:17.020]  I would describe as, you know, the end of currencies and essentially going to a company, a credit on the company's store,
[2:09:17.020 --> 2:09:20.020]  not unlike what the Chinese are doing with social credit.
[2:09:20.020 --> 2:09:22.020]  Stay there. This is the biggest thing ever.
[2:09:22.020 --> 2:09:28.020]  Katharine Austin Fitz, a top economist, former head of a major push administration department.
[2:09:28.020 --> 2:09:35.020]  She's an expert and she's going to lay out the real facts of what's coming next and what the whole COVID power grab is really about.
[2:09:35.020 --> 2:09:37.020]  Call everyone you know. That's how the show explodes.
[2:09:37.020 --> 2:09:42.020]  That's how we turn things around. Your action, you are the resistance to the right back.
[2:10:08.020 --> 2:10:21.020]  The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[2:10:21.020 --> 2:10:27.020]  Trump has finally figured this out since he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech on each modern situation.
[2:10:27.020 --> 2:10:31.020]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action.
[2:10:31.020 --> 2:10:38.020]  We, the people, are taking action now. You can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[2:10:38.020 --> 2:10:42.020]  and checking out the new, redesigned InfoWars.com and sharing that with you.
[2:10:42.020 --> 2:10:45.020]  Hope that really accepts them. Oh, yeah.
[2:10:45.020 --> 2:10:49.020]  I've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you.
[2:10:49.020 --> 2:10:54.020]  We've confirmed from high level sources in our own research that if Joe Biden's able to steal the election,
[2:10:54.020 --> 2:10:56.020]  and they're going to really try to do it, they're that crazy.
[2:10:56.020 --> 2:11:01.020]  They intend to not just shut down InfoWars but have yours truly, Alex Jones, arrested.
[2:11:01.020 --> 2:11:05.020]  And here's the really bad news. They're coming after everybody, and they're coming after the economy,
[2:11:05.020 --> 2:11:12.020]  and they want to totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash.
[2:11:12.020 --> 2:11:15.020]  But here's the really good news. The really good news.
[2:11:15.020 --> 2:11:19.020]  Humanity is awakening to this threat. We're no longer asleep.
[2:11:19.020 --> 2:11:26.020]  And we understand that the Globals are our mortal enemies, and we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free market,
[2:11:26.020 --> 2:11:30.020]  and our Judeo-Christian roots forever.
[2:11:30.020 --> 2:11:34.020]  That's why we must come together now as Americans of Erase, Color, and Cream,
[2:11:34.020 --> 2:11:39.020]  and repudiate the New World Order, and stand firm, and vote for Donald Trump,
[2:11:39.020 --> 2:11:49.020]  but also the Information War. Support independent media that tells the truth, like infowars.com. Thank you.
[2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:15.020]  Well, the editor-in-head of the Solari Report, Catherine Austin-Fitz, is our guest, the state of our currencies.
[2:12:15.020 --> 2:12:19.020]  What does it mean to get rid of cash? What does it mean to bring in this global system?
[2:12:19.020 --> 2:12:22.020]  Will it be abused? It's being abused day one.
[2:12:22.020 --> 2:12:28.020]  I'm seeing a shift, though, in Congress, from just saying, oh, Google might be censoring too.
[2:12:28.020 --> 2:12:34.020]  These are big cartels, bigger than governments, that are controlling information in markets and taking over.
[2:12:34.020 --> 2:12:42.020]  So finally, the almost-fistigial, almost-ceremonial government figures out how it's been arrogant as a bunch of lawyers,
[2:12:42.020 --> 2:12:47.020]  but is it too late? And so, get into the state of currencies.
[2:12:47.020 --> 2:12:51.020]  For those that don't know, they're getting rid of change now.
[2:12:51.020 --> 2:12:54.020]  With federal servicing, you can't have cash at Christmas.
[2:12:54.020 --> 2:12:59.020]  They are admittedly phasing this out globally. They're using COVID to do it. They're getting rid of any restaurant.
[2:12:59.020 --> 2:13:04.020]  Oh, you've got a QR code. Paper is dangerous. It means you've got to have a phone to be able to eat.
[2:13:04.020 --> 2:13:09.020]  I mean, we're literally becoming little robots where we have to have a little digital guardian with us,
[2:13:09.020 --> 2:13:14.020]  or we can't live, but then they can turn that off anytime they want.
[2:13:14.020 --> 2:13:21.020]  This is next-level slavery right out of a science fiction book. Catherine Austin-Fitz, again, Economist, please continue.
[2:13:21.020 --> 2:13:26.020]  Well, you know, it's interesting because I've been warning people, as have many, about this for years,
[2:13:26.020 --> 2:13:34.020]  but if you go back to the first big breakthrough in communicating the fact that the bankers wanted to chip us,
[2:13:34.020 --> 2:13:40.020]  in fact, Alex, you get the credit for your interview with Aaron Russo. Do you remember that?
[2:13:40.020 --> 2:13:45.020]  I do. It's got tens of millions of views. We hung out with the Rockefellers, and they said,
[2:13:45.020 --> 2:13:48.020]  our main goals have a chip, and then we control the global currency,
[2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:53.020]  and now that's in the patents that Bill Gates is funding.
[2:13:53.020 --> 2:14:02.020]  Well, if you look at the going direct reset and where those who would like very tight control want to go,
[2:14:02.020 --> 2:14:07.020]  there are five pillars to this thing, and we were talking about what's Trump doing.
[2:14:07.020 --> 2:14:15.020]  One of the most important pillars is the big pharma pillar, because what you want to do is you want to inject materials into people
[2:14:15.020 --> 2:14:22.020]  that allow you to literally link them up to the cloud, think of it as downloading an operating system into our bodies.
[2:14:22.020 --> 2:14:29.020]  And one of my problems with Trump is he's taken $10 billion that we could use for critical investment,
[2:14:29.020 --> 2:14:34.020]  critical protection of children and other people who need it, and as far as I'm concerned,
[2:14:34.020 --> 2:14:42.020]  wasted it as a boondoggle on big pharma for injections, which I think are going to help implement the system.
[2:14:42.020 --> 2:14:45.020]  Why is he doing it? Why is he using the military to do it?
[2:14:45.020 --> 2:14:52.020]  That's one of the biggest criticism, and I predicted it's to take control of the process from Fauci and from Gates,
[2:14:52.020 --> 2:14:55.020]  who were saying, oh, it'll be two years until we reopen, and we've got our new vaccines,
[2:14:55.020 --> 2:15:00.020]  and so Trump did that to boost confidence and to take the process away.
[2:15:00.020 --> 2:15:07.020]  But wait a minute. We have really good doctors all around the country and all around the world who are talking about,
[2:15:07.020 --> 2:15:11.020]  if you practice early intervention, there is no need for anybody.
[2:15:11.020 --> 2:15:14.020]  Cameron, I totally agree, and I think Trump's wrong.
[2:15:14.020 --> 2:15:20.020]  I know you do. So what they would say, what those doctors have said, there is no pandemic,
[2:15:20.020 --> 2:15:26.020]  so stop with the $10 billion for the injection, I call it the injection fraud,
[2:15:26.020 --> 2:15:30.020]  but we've forgotten how much money $10 billion is.
[2:15:30.020 --> 2:15:35.020]  $10 billion could solve a lot of hurt and a lot of pain and a lot of problems.
[2:15:35.020 --> 2:15:38.020]  Okay, let me keep going. We have a constitution.
[2:15:38.020 --> 2:15:40.020]  The constitution is the law of the land.
[2:15:40.020 --> 2:15:48.020]  It's superior to any state constitution, any state laws, and that constitution says there is,
[2:15:48.020 --> 2:15:53.020]  the government is not superior to controlled churches.
[2:15:53.020 --> 2:16:00.020]  You cannot have the U.S. government or state government shut down churches the way that this has happened.
[2:16:00.020 --> 2:16:02.020]  Where has Trump been on this?
[2:16:02.020 --> 2:16:07.020]  No, I agree. There is no jurisdiction as the federal and state courts are ruling.
[2:16:07.020 --> 2:16:11.020]  So it's all just color of law, it's all intimidation.
[2:16:11.020 --> 2:16:17.020]  Right, but remember, that's extraordinary intimidation to shut down the economy on Main Street,
[2:16:17.020 --> 2:16:20.020]  of which churches believe it or not are very important parts.
[2:16:20.020 --> 2:16:25.020]  Well, isn't war, siege the greatest form of war, shut something down?
[2:16:25.020 --> 2:16:29.020]  Right. This is World War III. Let me keep going.
[2:16:29.020 --> 2:16:36.020]  Why is it the average American has a cost of capital of 16 to 17 percent when interest rates are at 1 percent?
[2:16:36.020 --> 2:16:39.020]  You know, they're lucky if they get 1 percent of their bank CDs,
[2:16:39.020 --> 2:16:45.020]  but you're watching a huge number of the big companies that are picking up market share during this period
[2:16:45.020 --> 2:16:49.020]  paying essentially almost nothing for their cost of capital,
[2:16:49.020 --> 2:16:53.020]  very much subsidized by the Fed's intervention in the markets in a variety of ways.
[2:16:53.020 --> 2:16:57.020]  They were ready, they were prepared, they launched it, they're consolidating control.
[2:16:57.020 --> 2:17:00.020]  Right, exactly. Well, let me keep going.
[2:17:00.020 --> 2:17:05.020]  It was Trump who gave Microsoft the award for the DOD contract.
[2:17:05.020 --> 2:17:09.020]  You know, now Trump, I'm sure, would say it was a contract process at DOD,
[2:17:09.020 --> 2:17:14.020]  but we see huge contracts from the administration, from the intelligence agencies,
[2:17:14.020 --> 2:17:20.020]  into Amazon huge contracts, to LATOS, the former lock he'd spin off from the Navy,
[2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:23.020]  and huge contracts from DOD.
[2:17:23.020 --> 2:17:27.020]  Oh, Catherine, I was contacted by intelligence operatives inside the Trump administration six months ago,
[2:17:27.020 --> 2:17:31.020]  and they said lay off Bill Gates, so I know that his lobby is inside the White House,
[2:17:31.020 --> 2:17:33.020]  and I think it's a real blind spot for Trump.
[2:17:33.020 --> 2:17:39.020]  If he's obsessed with Bezos, I think Gates is worse.
[2:17:39.020 --> 2:17:42.020]  Well, but I don't, you know, I don't see Gates as the issue.
[2:17:42.020 --> 2:17:44.020]  I see the infrastructure as the issue.
[2:17:44.020 --> 2:17:48.020]  Because the question is, with Microsoft controlling that cloud,
[2:17:48.020 --> 2:17:53.020]  and the injections probably hooking people up directly to that cloud,
[2:17:53.020 --> 2:17:57.020]  who has access to that cloud?
[2:17:57.020 --> 2:18:01.020]  Exactly, it's the infrastructure putting all of our stuff out there in the world that's dangerous.
[2:18:01.020 --> 2:18:03.020]  It's the fact that it's there.
[2:18:03.020 --> 2:18:10.020]  Well, I, you know, I would bitch you a dollar that other countries have access into that cloud.
[2:18:10.020 --> 2:18:16.020]  Well, you know, we know China has access into the Apple cloud.
[2:18:16.020 --> 2:18:18.020]  You know, I'm not sure, but...
[2:18:18.020 --> 2:18:20.020]  But you're talking about the defense cloud.
[2:18:20.020 --> 2:18:23.020]  Oh, absolutely, you know they've got access.
[2:18:23.020 --> 2:18:28.020]  Well, you know, my concern is not China, my concern is Israel on that one.
[2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:32.020]  We'll talk about it. Lay it out. Israel, yeah, they love to sell our stuff.
[2:18:32.020 --> 2:18:39.020]  Right, so I just think the cyber, one of the big problems with moving to a digital currency is where,
[2:18:39.020 --> 2:18:45.020]  and you heard this, you heard the chairman of the Federal Reserve this week on a cross payment panel
[2:18:45.020 --> 2:18:50.020]  with the IMF say the same thing, that there are real concerns about cybersecurity
[2:18:50.020 --> 2:18:55.020]  and doing anything, let alone depending on anything on this platform.
[2:18:55.020 --> 2:19:00.020]  And so that's why, you know, one of the pillars is big pharma, one of the pillars obviously is the bankers,
[2:19:00.020 --> 2:19:02.020]  but another one of the pillars is tech.
[2:19:02.020 --> 2:19:08.020]  And the tech guys are perfectly happy to take the global currency system and just throw it out there and play
[2:19:08.020 --> 2:19:12.020]  and, you know, see what you can come up with, make it up as you go.
[2:19:12.020 --> 2:19:17.020]  Exactly, they're trying to force adoption of this just by randomly beta testing it on us.
[2:19:17.020 --> 2:19:23.020]  Right, and the danger or the positive scenario depending on who you're, you know,
[2:19:23.020 --> 2:19:28.020]  which side you sit on this is the, you know, what we're watching right now
[2:19:28.020 --> 2:19:31.020]  and what we've been watching since the going direct reset has been approved
[2:19:31.020 --> 2:19:36.020]  is an effort to extend and keep the dollar system going and then to accelerate the new system.
[2:19:36.020 --> 2:19:41.020]  Now, the new system to me is a transhumanist system, I want nothing to do with it.
[2:19:41.020 --> 2:19:49.020]  And of course, one of the possibilities which I think is very likely is the new system doesn't come in
[2:19:49.020 --> 2:19:56.020]  and get integrated before the old system really spirals down and we end up with a real mess.
[2:19:56.020 --> 2:20:03.020]  And the question for every one of us is not, you know, how are we going to survive the system they're implementing?
[2:20:03.020 --> 2:20:09.020]  My question is how are we going to build an alternative system when their system fails?
[2:20:09.020 --> 2:20:15.020]  And so your mission is, hey, there's two competing systems, one's being phased out, one's being built.
[2:20:15.020 --> 2:20:20.020]  It's very predatory. We better think about other system because the whole future is a new system
[2:20:20.020 --> 2:20:24.020]  and that's the battle for the future. All right, let's talk about your idea for a new system.
[2:20:24.020 --> 2:20:25.020]  Okay.
[2:20:25.020 --> 2:20:29.020]  With Catherine Austin, straight ahead, very powerful, salari.com.
[2:20:29.020 --> 2:20:36.020]  This is everything, folks, which he's talking about is the big enchilada and the globalists don't want you thinking about big systems
[2:20:36.020 --> 2:20:40.020]  or infrastructures. No, they just want you to sit there and take it. You're not an animal.
[2:20:40.020 --> 2:20:44.020]  You control your environment. You can change it.
[2:20:44.020 --> 2:20:50.020]  Vitamin mineral fusion and Ultra 12 are now back in stock after being sold out for months.
[2:20:50.020 --> 2:20:55.020]  They're sold out because people know that high quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins, minerals, especially zinc,
[2:20:55.020 --> 2:21:00.020]  boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your immune system.
[2:21:00.020 --> 2:21:05.020]  Well, both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[2:21:05.020 --> 2:21:12.020]  It's two weeks after the election and we're offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple patriot points
[2:21:12.020 --> 2:21:16.020]  at your next order. Also, if you sign up for auto shipping and additional 10% off,
[2:21:16.020 --> 2:21:19.020]  that makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders.
[2:21:19.020 --> 2:21:24.020]  Now, we have had a big clearance sale going, so a lot of stuff sold out while the other stuff is close to selling out.
[2:21:24.020 --> 2:21:28.020]  Some of our best sellers are still there and some of them have actually come back in to stock.
[2:21:28.020 --> 2:21:33.020]  And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the other things that have actually sold out.
[2:21:33.020 --> 2:21:38.020]  So those should be back in stock as well soon. Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the year.
[2:21:38.020 --> 2:21:42.020]  Obviously, we're critical of the fight and you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[2:22:09.020 --> 2:22:16.020]  So they are throwing everything they've got and not just the American people, but the people of the world.
[2:22:16.020 --> 2:22:20.020]  That's why your word of mouth is beyond chain. It is paramount.
[2:22:20.020 --> 2:22:26.020]  When you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when you shoot your own video or write your own article
[2:22:26.020 --> 2:22:30.020]  or knock on your neighbor's door and talk to them or call your friends and family and tell them to vote for Trump.
[2:22:30.020 --> 2:22:36.020]  When you speak out against the system, when you do things that seem little, together it adds up into giant things.
[2:22:36.020 --> 2:22:43.020]  Many hands make life work. History's happening now. Take action now while you still can. Please, for all of our futures.
[2:23:06.020 --> 2:23:14.020]  The lockdown is permanent. It is a plan to lower carbon footprint. It is a plan to make the world population poor.
[2:23:14.020 --> 2:23:21.020]  It is a diabolical power grab. It is a revolution against the industrial revolution. They call it the post-industrial world.
[2:23:21.020 --> 2:23:27.020]  And it's the excuse for them to take control every fast of our lives and implement absolute authoritarianism.
[2:23:27.020 --> 2:23:32.020]  So again, everybody out there, if you love your children, but my daughter that just woke up here
[2:23:32.020 --> 2:23:37.020]  and if you care about yourselves in any future, you need to get awake. You need to understand this information.
[2:23:37.020 --> 2:24:03.020]  You need to warn others, okay? It's a life and death situation.
[2:24:08.020 --> 2:24:14.020]  If I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee stud.
[2:24:14.020 --> 2:24:22.020]  Had some trouble with my sweetheart's paw. One of her brothers was a bad outlaw.
[2:24:22.020 --> 2:24:29.020]  I rode a letter to my uncle's foot and I rode away on a Tennessee stud.
[2:24:29.020 --> 2:24:37.020]  Catherine Austin visits our guests. She's covering the key issue that they're phasing out the old cash dollar system, bringing in the new global digital system.
[2:24:37.020 --> 2:24:41.020]  But they're testing it. They're manipulating it. There's a bunch of groups fighting over it.
[2:24:41.020 --> 2:24:48.020]  And wow, this system they admit they're going to use, just like the social credit score on the internet, to control what we do and say.
[2:24:48.020 --> 2:24:55.020]  So we better start understanding now that we should build alternative systems just from a capitalist position to create some new
[2:24:55.020 --> 2:25:02.020]  patriot currency or some patriot bank where you weren't discriminated against, whether you were liberal or conservative, that was just free speech again.
[2:25:02.020 --> 2:25:10.020]  I mean, this is the big enchilada. So this is next years, next decades news today. Catherine Austin Fitz, please continue.
[2:25:10.020 --> 2:25:21.020]  So the number one thing I think anybody listening to this needs to do, Alex, is to ask the question, where are you going to get good, healthy local food for the next five to 10 years?
[2:25:21.020 --> 2:25:29.020]  Because as we're watching centralization of the financial system and all resources, we're watching central control of the food system going on.
[2:25:29.020 --> 2:25:37.020]  So if you're going to rebuild your local economy, one of the first things you want to rebuild it around is local food systems.
[2:25:37.020 --> 2:25:43.020]  That's number one. The second thing is, of course, how can you circulate equity and currency locally?
[2:25:43.020 --> 2:25:54.020]  And that gets to the integrity of your digital and telecommunication systems locally. When I was on last time, I told you, Bill Binney's one of my favorite reforms was recommended by Bill Binney.
[2:25:54.020 --> 2:26:00.020]  When he said, integrate into the schools curriculum, teach the kids how to make encryption systems.
[2:26:00.020 --> 2:26:08.020]  He said, if every community builds its own encryption systems homegrown, it will drive the system crazy. They won't be able to deal with it.
[2:26:08.020 --> 2:26:14.020]  Because when there's no financial or economic privacy, you can't build wealth.
[2:26:14.020 --> 2:26:23.020]  So part of sort of reengineering more economic power debt to the local areas, getting the systems having integrity.
[2:26:23.020 --> 2:26:28.020]  Then the next thing, of course, is shelter and food and law and order.
[2:26:28.020 --> 2:26:36.020]  A lot of people are paying attention to the presidential election. We need to pay a lot more attention to the local sheriff and city council elections.
[2:26:36.020 --> 2:26:42.020]  You need to understand how the money works in the local governments around you and who your sheriff is.
[2:26:42.020 --> 2:26:58.020]  Because as counties all over across the America have learned, if they have a good sheriff, they're in much better shape than if they didn't have a sheriff who just was going to take orders from the state house or the federal government and do things that were unconstitutional.
[2:26:58.020 --> 2:27:18.020]  So a lot of this is coming back to ground zero in your area and saying, okay, whether it's safety, whether it's circulating the money locally, or whether getting the basic food shelter energy, how am I going to do that?
[2:27:18.020 --> 2:27:33.020]  And I think most people have been indifferent to the many of the things going on at the state and local level, but that jurisdictional risk is going to grow.
[2:27:33.020 --> 2:27:45.020]  So for example, I live in a state which is very well managed from a fiscal standpoint. That's going to make a huge difference in terms of taxes and services compared to a state that is in real financial trouble.
[2:27:45.020 --> 2:28:04.020]  If you're in one of the states, Truth in Accounting just did a new study on state and local governments. If you're in one of the worst five states as listed by Truth in Accounting, you've got a real problem in terms of services and the kind of hikes you could be seeing in taxes or property taxes.
[2:28:04.020 --> 2:28:16.020]  And the big global banks are making it sexy the breakdown of civilization. Now it's good for the earth and how there's a global reset to making poor, but actually that's going to cause war, famine and collapse and really hurt the environment.
[2:28:16.020 --> 2:28:21.020]  So this thing we hear about the environment, there's nothing to do with it. It's about power.
[2:28:21.020 --> 2:28:30.020]  Well, in fact, the way to improve the environment is to realign the financial system by place.
[2:28:30.020 --> 2:28:39.020]  So if you allow places to circulate equity and currency locally and didn't sort of try and stop them at every turn and let the small businesses compete.
[2:28:39.020 --> 2:28:47.020]  Exactly. We need micro economies for local solutions. Explain the best thinking on that, which is what the opposite of globalism just top down.
[2:28:47.020 --> 2:28:58.020]  So let's pretend for a second that I had a venture fund with publicly traded stock for my neighborhood. What could I do to make that stock go up? I could heal the environment.
[2:28:58.020 --> 2:29:12.020]  So in other words, local investors could profit from turning the environment around and having a financial system where there was a win-win relationship, the two, both money and the environment were in alignment.
[2:29:12.020 --> 2:29:26.020]  So there are real solutions. To me, you don't serve the environment by having total central control and reducing everybody to poverty. To me, that just makes things worse.
[2:29:26.020 --> 2:29:40.020]  Well, yeah, and all their actuaries I've seen show it triggers collapse in war and a flood into the first world that'll swamp that engine and implode the wealth, consolidating power for the big tech people and the Jeff Bezos's of the world.
[2:29:40.020 --> 2:29:46.020]  Because when everything else collapses, they'll be the ones delivering you everything that you're able to get at whatever price they want.
[2:29:46.020 --> 2:30:00.020]  Well, what we've watched over the last year is the biggest disaster capitalism taking and grabbing that we've ever seen. And I think many people struggle to see it.
[2:30:00.020 --> 2:30:11.020]  You know, they've done a very good job of getting the central bank piece to look very separate from the tech piece, to look very separate from the big pharma space, to look very separate from the media and the military piece.
[2:30:11.020 --> 2:30:25.020]  And the reason I wrote state of our currencies is to help bring it together, integrate it and show. And of course, the big question that you and I have asked for many, many years is why? Why are they trying to centralize control to such an extent?
[2:30:25.020 --> 2:30:37.020]  And it just may be the technology lets them get away with it. And unfortunately, what we've seen is many, many people in America be absolutely tricked and snookered by all of this.
[2:30:37.020 --> 2:30:41.020]  You know, they believe the lies.
[2:30:41.020 --> 2:30:50.020]  When I see the predatory nature of this and how they back wars for no reason, and how just to consolidate just so there's more numbers, they're already in charge.
[2:30:50.020 --> 2:30:58.020]  I just wish there was a way to get them to stop. I mean, Trump, as you said, is trying to end these wars. That's something positive he's done, but many of the areas he's gone along with them.
[2:30:58.020 --> 2:31:07.020]  But I just, I don't know how they see it as sustainable for them. How they think they build a dystopia that they're going to be insulated from. They're not going to be insulated.
[2:31:07.020 --> 2:31:18.020]  So let me be a bad guy. You know, the average American has gone along with war. You know, we have been for many centuries on what I call the central banking warfare model.
[2:31:18.020 --> 2:31:26.020]  And warfare has been a very big business for Americans and the general population has generally supported it.
[2:31:26.020 --> 2:31:33.020]  So when we came into the 2016 election, Lawrence Wilkerson, he used to be Chief of Staff to Powell, gave an excellent speech.
[2:31:33.020 --> 2:31:41.020]  And he said, you know, the question between these two candidates is can either one of us, one of them, get us off the war model?
[2:31:41.020 --> 2:31:47.020]  One of the reasons a lot of people voted for Trump was they felt he would be less supportive of starting new wars than Clinton's.
[2:31:47.020 --> 2:32:00.020]  The wrap-up we did at that time on the cover, it said, can, you know, can Trump clean up the swamp, you know, and move forward to make America great again without more organized crime, without more warfare.
[2:32:00.020 --> 2:32:03.020]  This is a big model change. And it's what it is.
[2:32:03.020 --> 2:32:09.020]  And is it his attempt actually in these wars of someone successful, a giant success?
[2:32:09.020 --> 2:32:17.020]  Well, I would say he started no new wars. And that's much harder to accomplish than you would think.
[2:32:17.020 --> 2:32:21.020]  Yeah, what President in four years didn't start a war. I mean, it's always happening.
[2:32:21.020 --> 2:32:27.020]  Right. But he has spent a great deal on the military. And, you know, we are now, if you look...
[2:32:27.020 --> 2:32:34.020]  Well, that's the Trump philosophy. He does what he says he'll do, but he still gives them all the money.
[2:32:34.020 --> 2:32:38.020]  He even says, stop bitching. You got all the money and I don't go kill people.
[2:32:38.020 --> 2:32:45.020]  Yeah, but our number one problem, Alex, is that way too much of the global economy is behind a wall of secrecy.
[2:32:45.020 --> 2:32:56.020]  And no one has contributed more to increasing that secrecy than McConnell, Pelosi, Trump in 2018.
[2:32:56.020 --> 2:32:59.020]  And it was bipartisan. It was both Congress...
[2:32:59.020 --> 2:33:04.020]  There's no doubt that there is an ongoing consolidation of power and COVID has only accelerated that.
[2:33:04.020 --> 2:33:12.020]  Exactly. Exactly. So it comes down to, are you on the pro-centralization team or on the decentralization team?
[2:33:12.020 --> 2:33:15.020]  I'm on the decentralization team. Tell us how we decentralize.
[2:33:15.020 --> 2:33:19.020]  Final segment, Catherine Austin Fitz straight ahead. Solari.com.
[2:33:19.020 --> 2:33:25.020]  You can get a copy of her Solari report at the end of currencies, the state of our currencies.
[2:33:25.020 --> 2:33:30.020]  It's very, very important and you need to read it. We'll be right back with her.
[2:33:30.020 --> 2:33:36.020]  You cannot talk about a more serious issue, folks. This is real-world stuff, real infrastructure, how the planet works.
[2:33:36.020 --> 2:33:42.020]  You're talking, not even care about any of this. I know the general listeners do care, but we got to get other people to care.
[2:33:42.020 --> 2:33:47.020]  As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election.
[2:33:47.020 --> 2:33:52.020]  And the globalist-controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against them.
[2:33:52.020 --> 2:33:55.020]  The whole planet is in a huge populace for alignment.
[2:33:55.020 --> 2:34:05.020]  And so they've openly said, we need to go to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking and arresting anyone that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[2:34:05.020 --> 2:34:11.020]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's base
[2:34:11.020 --> 2:34:14.020]  and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[2:34:14.020 --> 2:34:19.020]  This is what all the old Clintonistas are saying. It's what the Obama bots are saying.
[2:34:19.020 --> 2:34:23.020]  It's what Keith Overman's saying. It's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[2:34:23.020 --> 2:34:28.020]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent.
[2:34:28.020 --> 2:34:32.020]  And they intend to keep the lockdowns going forever and force denoculations.
[2:34:32.020 --> 2:34:36.020]  Trump is trying to end the lockdowns and is saying vaccines will be voluntary.
[2:34:36.020 --> 2:34:42.020]  Donald Trump or die. You've got to get Trump in. Everybody get out there and vote. Tell your family to vote now.
[2:34:42.020 --> 2:34:44.020]  Black Friday in October.
[2:34:44.020 --> 2:34:50.020]  Last year, that was one of our most popular sales that we ran in the last couple weeks of October.
[2:34:50.020 --> 2:34:57.020]  And it was popular for a reason. Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October.
[2:34:57.020 --> 2:35:03.020]  And that means 30 to 60% off, store-wide free shipping, triple-patriot points at 15% off your next order.
[2:35:03.020 --> 2:35:09.020]  And everybody that signs up for auto-shipping additional 10% off, that makes many of these items lost leaders.
[2:35:09.020 --> 2:35:12.020]  Now, a lot of stuff sold out. Some of our best sellers are still there.
[2:35:12.020 --> 2:35:18.020]  But some good news. Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all the other vitamins and minerals and amino acids for adults and children
[2:35:18.020 --> 2:35:24.020]  that boost your body's natural defenses. It is back in stock, back on sale today, which is two weeks of the election.
[2:35:24.020 --> 2:35:28.020]  And more good news. Ultra-12, it's got the name Ultra for a reason.
[2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:35.020]  Highest quality, vitamin B-12. Take it under the tongue for full absorption. It is now back in stock.
[2:35:35.020 --> 2:35:39.020]  Both of those are 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[2:35:39.020 --> 2:35:42.020]  Infowarstore.com. Black Friday comes in October.
[2:35:42.020 --> 2:35:49.020]  If you pay close attention to what Big Tech is actually saying, and more importantly, what they're actually doing,
[2:35:49.020 --> 2:35:59.020]  when they shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story, that was a test to see if they could work in concert to totally suppress information.
[2:35:59.020 --> 2:36:06.020]  Because they've also been on record saying, coming up on election day and thereafter, they're not going to let anyone but, quote,
[2:36:06.020 --> 2:36:13.020]  authoritative sources. That means CNN, New York Times, what a joke, come out and say who the real winner is.
[2:36:13.020 --> 2:36:18.020]  That way they can contest the election, even though Trump's declared winner, hold everything up with the ballots,
[2:36:18.020 --> 2:36:24.020]  then cause a constitutional crisis, call for secession, and have the UN come in and declare the election for Biden.
[2:36:24.020 --> 2:36:27.020]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:31.020]  And so when you see them in concert censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[2:36:31.020 --> 2:36:38.020]  that is a drill, that is a test to get all their systems ready, but also to condition the public that Big Tech works in unison
[2:36:38.020 --> 2:37:05.020]  to suppress speech and information. This is Election Meddling 101. This is illegal.
[2:37:09.020 --> 2:37:13.020]  The exact same links, the exact same videos, we can comment and share them everything.
[2:37:13.020 --> 2:37:19.020]  The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[2:37:19.020 --> 2:37:25.020]  Trump has finally figured this out, and since he's going to take action once re-elected, he gets Big Tech on a huge modern situation.
[2:37:25.020 --> 2:37:30.020]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action.
[2:37:30.020 --> 2:37:35.020]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[2:37:35.020 --> 2:37:40.020]  and checking out the new redesigned infowars.com and sharing that link.
[2:37:40.020 --> 2:37:42.020]  Hope that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[2:37:42.020 --> 2:38:05.020]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:26.020]  Okay, some big news just broke, and normally, if I had a great guest on, I would still run over five minutes to cover it,
[2:38:26.020 --> 2:38:30.020]  but I'm going to do it next hour. I'm going to take 15 minutes for Dr. Nick Baggage.
[2:38:30.020 --> 2:38:38.020]  Wait till I cover this at six after. Just wait. You know, I don't plant hooks to have you tune into the next segment unless it's really powerful.
[2:38:38.020 --> 2:38:43.020]  This is a pattern they've been doing. In fact, Joe Biden did it too, guys.
[2:38:43.020 --> 2:38:48.020]  So go ahead and get the clip of him saying 220 million Americans died.
[2:38:48.020 --> 2:38:58.020]  Kamala Harris just said 220 million Americans. That means if there were, again, like 10 people in my office,
[2:38:58.020 --> 2:39:02.020]  that means like six of them are dead, basically, seven of them are dead.
[2:39:02.020 --> 2:39:10.020]  It's not even one tenth of one percent that's dead. She's saying over two thirds are dead or right at two thirds.
[2:39:10.020 --> 2:39:17.020]  This is just absolutely insane. I'm going to play the next hour and get into it, but they're doing this on purpose.
[2:39:17.020 --> 2:39:22.020]  It's a psychological warfare. I mean, I know people that believe that half of America is dead.
[2:39:22.020 --> 2:39:25.020]  I know people that I see and I go, listen, you don't have to wear your mask.
[2:39:25.020 --> 2:39:32.020]  It's like crying like it's their baby blanket and they believe everybody's dead. But economists,
[2:39:32.020 --> 2:39:39.020]  Catherine Austin fifth continuing with solutions, how to counter this, how to create a new economy that isn't a global system.
[2:39:39.020 --> 2:39:41.020]  Please continue.
[2:39:41.020 --> 2:39:50.020]  Well, Alex, I'm glad you brought that up because what people need to do to build a decent economy is they need to build a life on science and facts.
[2:39:50.020 --> 2:39:55.020]  And that's why transparency is so important. You can't get anywhere without transparency.
[2:39:55.020 --> 2:40:02.020]  There was a poll about a month ago was mentioned in lockdown lunacy 3.0 by JP Hanley.
[2:40:02.020 --> 2:40:12.020]  The average or a poll of the Americans showed that Americans thought that 9% of the American population had died from COVID.
[2:40:12.020 --> 2:40:24.020]  Now that's 30 million people, not 220 million. When, in fact, that was right before the CDC came out and revised their statistics to say less than 10,000 people had died from COVID-19.
[2:40:24.020 --> 2:40:37.020]  So, you know, without comorbidity. So if you look at 10,000 people versus a popular opinion of 30 million, what it tells me is the number one reform you need to do is you need to throw out your TV.
[2:40:37.020 --> 2:40:47.020]  Well, exactly. I ran into somebody today that said, why don't you care about the millions of dead, Alex? And they were like crying saying, don't you care?
[2:40:47.020 --> 2:40:53.020]  And I said, it's not true, but they believe it. They think the news wouldn't lie to them about that. I mean, this is huge.
[2:40:53.020 --> 2:41:00.020]  So she's clearly, her and Joe have now both said repeatedly, 220 million dead. What the hell is going on here?
[2:41:00.020 --> 2:41:11.020]  So the war is for your mind. And we know that the TV and these different mediums use entrainment technology and supplemental programming.
[2:41:11.020 --> 2:41:19.020]  The reality is many Americans are concerned about confiscation of property. The property you need to worry about being confiscated is your mind.
[2:41:19.020 --> 2:41:20.020]  Wow.
[2:41:20.020 --> 2:41:31.020]  Absolutely. The central bankers don't need to confiscate property if they can confiscate your mind. Then they can have your property whenever they want it, right?
[2:41:31.020 --> 2:41:42.020]  So this is very serious. You need to have a coherent mind and you need to be able to look at your situation in terms of time and money mathematically.
[2:41:42.020 --> 2:41:50.020]  So the first thing I would say is this is a spiritual war. You need to pray and you need to protect your mind.
[2:41:50.020 --> 2:41:56.020]  And you need to make sure that your mind is clear and coherent. The next thing you need to do is you need to bank local.
[2:41:56.020 --> 2:42:04.020]  If you're banking with any of the big banks running this going direct reset, you're financing it. Why are you financing your enemy?
[2:42:04.020 --> 2:42:14.020]  Then you need to figure out a way to start circulating money locally. And the big important one is fresh food because health isn't important.
[2:42:14.020 --> 2:42:24.020]  If you travel across America, I know you travel out. We've seen you know America is being poisoned. We're in the middle of a huge poisoning and whatever is going on with health.
[2:42:24.020 --> 2:42:30.020]  That's a big part of it. And injections and pharmaceuticals are a very big part of it as well.
[2:42:30.020 --> 2:42:35.020]  You need to get healthy and you need to do whatever you can that's under your control.
[2:42:35.020 --> 2:42:42.020]  If you look at how we're spending our money, you know, many of us, I'm guilty too. We're all poisoning ourselves.
[2:42:42.020 --> 2:42:49.020]  So we need to get radical about health and stop poisoning ourselves and stop going along with these different things that are poisoning us.
[2:42:49.020 --> 2:42:54.020]  And then it's back to how do you get a great education for your kids?
[2:42:54.020 --> 2:43:08.020]  If you look, unfortunately, what's happening is we're all paying property taxes and it's creating an educational establishment that we can't use because the curriculum is not preparing our children for competition in a global economy.
[2:43:08.020 --> 2:43:20.020]  And now they're mandating everything from, you know, the kids can't breathe because they're wearing mask is to, you know, you have to inject them with things that give them heavy metals poisoning and autism.
[2:43:20.020 --> 2:43:25.020]  So isn't this really what cults always do once they start falling apart?
[2:43:25.020 --> 2:43:30.020]  They go, we're controlling where you can go. You got to wear this covering. You got to wear this mask.
[2:43:30.020 --> 2:43:32.020]  I mean, this is cult programming.
[2:43:32.020 --> 2:43:36.020]  Right. You must homeschool. You must homeschool.
[2:43:36.020 --> 2:43:41.020]  So, you know, get out of the banks that are doing this, get your kids out of the schools that are doing this.
[2:43:41.020 --> 2:43:49.020]  Every chance you have to withdraw your money, your time and your support, get it out, get it away and get it into something that could work.
[2:43:49.020 --> 2:43:55.020]  Well, I mean, I've done the same thing. We're with a small Texas bank now, this whole operation.
[2:43:55.020 --> 2:43:58.020]  And so, you know, I was with another Texas bank, but they're globalists now.
[2:43:58.020 --> 2:44:03.020]  And I told the story last hour, I had this big Texas bank a couple of months ago say, we're closing your account.
[2:44:03.020 --> 2:44:11.020]  It's your politics. And they, and when we went in to close the account, they said, oh, we want your children's little tutma, little, you know, education accounts.
[2:44:11.020 --> 2:44:15.020]  We're even big accounts. They said, we don't want any relationship with your family.
[2:44:15.020 --> 2:44:19.020]  That's the note the banker had. We want no relationship with your family.
[2:44:19.020 --> 2:44:24.020]  Talk about Nazi Germany, so it shows you what they'll do in the future with this control.
[2:44:24.020 --> 2:44:28.020]  I mean, these people are monsters and they don't even recognize it.
[2:44:28.020 --> 2:44:38.020]  So, I'll tell you a very interesting story. As you know, I, for 11 years, I litigated with the Department of Justice and had a huge food fight of the kind you're describing.
[2:44:38.020 --> 2:44:50.020]  And an effort was made to shut off all my different sources of income and revenue, you know, the same disaster capitalism, sort of economic warfare that we're all dealing with now.
[2:44:50.020 --> 2:44:55.020]  And what was interesting is, for the 20 years prior, I had given or-
[2:44:55.020 --> 2:45:00.020]  Hey, guys, the crew's not talking to me, so I don't know if we're on air. I'm sorry I have to do this live on air.
[2:45:00.020 --> 2:45:08.020]  I've lost audio and we had about 10 seconds of that air. I don't have audio on my headset. Not a big deal. We have technical difficulties sometimes.
[2:45:08.020 --> 2:45:12.020]  But they're froze up in there. Okay. I need a quick response.
[2:45:12.020 --> 2:45:17.020]  So, all right. Catherine, sorry, I lost audio to you. They didn't tell me.
[2:45:17.020 --> 2:45:22.020]  Can I go?
[2:45:22.020 --> 2:45:24.020]  Tell a story. Go ahead.
[2:45:24.020 --> 2:45:34.020]  Okay. So, in the 20 years before, I had given or loaned $250,000 to friends and family, you know, was out there on the network.
[2:45:34.020 --> 2:45:39.020]  That, during the next 11 years, that money came back. Everybody got together and said, well, I guess she needs it back.
[2:45:39.020 --> 2:45:46.020]  And they loaned or gifted $250,000 to me. You know, I finally added it up when it was all over and it was exactly that money.
[2:45:46.020 --> 2:45:53.020]  It was out there in the community and came back. If it wasn't for that money, I'd be dead. I would never have made it.
[2:45:53.020 --> 2:46:09.020]  So, what I'm saying is, you know, invest in people you can trust and people who you can count on who will circulate it back to you.
[2:46:09.020 --> 2:46:15.020]  Stop financing the national security state and start financing the people you can count on.
[2:46:15.020 --> 2:46:26.020]  And hopefully, that includes some farmers.
[2:46:26.020 --> 2:46:33.020]  Okay. If you come to Salieri, I would strongly recommend you get state of our currencies.
[2:46:33.020 --> 2:46:41.020]  What you need to understand is this going direct reset has, which started last year, is going to go on for quite some time.
[2:46:41.020 --> 2:46:50.020]  And it may be combined with health care crisis and it may be combined with a variety of other sort of geopolitical events.
[2:46:50.020 --> 2:46:59.020]  But it is a major change. And what is very helpful for all of us to do is understand it's going to take a long time.
[2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:05.020]  My estimate it could probably take two to three years, at worst case, five to 10 years.
[2:47:05.020 --> 2:47:14.020]  But the other thing is we need to be prepared for that. The other thing we need to understand is there does need to be a reset.
[2:47:14.020 --> 2:47:22.020]  The model we've been using since World War II, the Bretton Woods model is changing because we're going to a multipolar world.
[2:47:22.020 --> 2:47:33.020]  And so the question I would ask everyone is, yes, reject what the central bankers are doing and reject the current reset plan.
[2:47:33.020 --> 2:47:42.020]  But the question is, what's our plan? We do need a reset. And so a reset is going to happen. The question is, do you want it to happen nice or rough?
[2:47:42.020 --> 2:47:47.020]  And again, I have a wireless headset. Normally it doesn't have problems. Maybe once a month it might.
[2:47:47.020 --> 2:47:51.020]  They put new batteries in and had a weird problem and cutouts. I apologize for that.
[2:47:51.020 --> 2:48:00.020]  Katherine, you've done a great job here. And what you're saying is the global resets here, they're trying to do it artificially because they know their fraudulent system is coming down.
[2:48:00.020 --> 2:48:06.020]  They're also using the turbulence from that and covetous the cover to consolidate even more power greedily.
[2:48:06.020 --> 2:48:15.020]  And so this is a very important discussion about who to blame, but also that we've got to take matters in our own hands and start becoming self-sufficient because they're building a very unsustainable world.
[2:48:15.020 --> 2:48:30.020]  Right. So their reset is one to a transhumanist central control. If we want to have a human society, we need a reset to something that has much more fundamental bottom-up productivity and is much more decent.

[2:50:45.020 --> 2:50:57.020]  When I grow up, I'm going to defeat the new world order. We are live, 10 days after Friday, October 23rd.
[2:50:57.020 --> 2:51:14.020]  Alright folks, speaking of technocracies and how dangerous they are, in the great kind of 1984 spinoff, Terry Gilliam made Brazil a bug, a fly falls into a typewriter at the Ministry of Truth, the Ministry of Love or of Torture.
[2:51:14.020 --> 2:51:29.020]  And so they go instead of tuddle its buttle or something, so they go swat team this guy taking him in torture into death because a bug fell in the typewriter. I've got little switches right over here that take me on air and off air.
[2:51:29.020 --> 2:51:44.020]  And the little switch because how they have it set up is an orthodox, I guess, bumped over and fell off the table. And so I was banging the table. It was, it was squeezed up between the bench and the table here and was taking me on and off air.
[2:51:44.020 --> 2:51:53.020]  So that's just an example of how we build these technocracies, but then we don't know how things run. We're not in control anymore. And so these technocrats think they're so powerful.
[2:51:53.020 --> 2:52:09.020]  But despite all they've been doing to censor Trump of the American people, it's not been working. So it shows real power as human power, not this so called AI like Steve Wozniak, the founder of Apple says the most powerful AI isn't a million times less powerful than an ant's brain.
[2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:17.020]  We're just not using our brains. And what she said was so thought provoking. Catherine Austin Fitzgerald just tuned in. I mean, she's so powerful. I never heard that said it's true.
[2:52:17.020 --> 2:52:26.020]  They don't need to conquer your bank account or your mind. And so that's what you need to worry about being stolen. So we got about three minutes left. Sorry about the technical difficulties. You're awesome.
[2:52:26.020 --> 2:52:30.020]  But to finish up with this amazing stuff you're covering.
[2:52:30.020 --> 2:52:41.020]  So I just went through the, you know, the different things you can do. I think the important thing to understand Alex is there. There are plenty of solutions. Each person is different.
[2:52:41.020 --> 2:52:57.020]  So how you would use your time in your community is different than how I would use mine. The little secret here that no one talks about is the fact that if you took the economy and you realigned the financial system with the environment so that you had a win-win relationship between
[2:52:57.020 --> 2:53:05.020]  living things and money, you know, so people could make money by healing the environment or making education better or all these different things.
[2:53:05.020 --> 2:53:12.020]  If you look at the wealth explosion that is possible and then you add the new technology, it's astonishing.
[2:53:12.020 --> 2:53:23.020]  Now, you know, so the wealth that's on planet Earth could, in my opinion, be hundreds of times what it is now, many multiples. But that requires an advanced civilization.
[2:53:23.020 --> 2:53:27.020]  You know, it requires us all growing up.
[2:53:27.020 --> 2:53:33.020]  That requires greedy globalists not wanting to keep people poor to control them. Exactly. If they're so great, make everybody rich. We could do it.
[2:53:33.020 --> 2:53:43.020]  I'm going to be a tough guy because it's not just the globalists that are greedy. If you go back and look at the history of this, this is everybody. The swamp is from sea to shining sea.
[2:53:43.020 --> 2:53:55.020]  And, you know, I've spent the last 25 years trying to explain to everybody the corruption in the money and what I've discovered is as, you know, people believe if it makes me money, it's good.
[2:53:55.020 --> 2:54:02.020]  And if it loses me money, it's bad. And so if everybody's making money in war and everybody's making unorganized crime, you know,
[2:54:02.020 --> 2:54:11.020]  we're all pretending, you know, we're good and they are bad. But we're all really kind of a lesser degree of Joe Biden.
[2:54:11.020 --> 2:54:21.020]  No, I wouldn't say that. But but the economic dependency on organized crime and warfare is serious and we can't get out of that and change.
[2:54:21.020 --> 2:54:30.020]  I call it turning the red button green. We can't get to turning the red button green unless we have transparency. And so the key to this is transparency.
[2:54:30.020 --> 2:54:34.020]  And that's why we're going to stop incentivizing corrupt predatory stuff.
[2:54:34.020 --> 2:54:42.020]  Right. Exactly. Exactly. Well, come back again in a month or so on turning the red button green. Solari.com.
[2:54:42.020 --> 2:54:48.020]  People should get your publication and your magazine and all of it. We love you. We really appreciate your time. 30 seconds left.
[2:54:48.020 --> 2:54:50.020]  Do you think Trump's going to win the election?
[2:54:50.020 --> 2:54:55.020]  Probably. I think I would give it 80% chance or better that Trump wins.
[2:54:55.020 --> 2:55:00.020]  What I don't understand is what the shenanigans around the mail in voting could do.
[2:55:00.020 --> 2:55:02.020]  That's the real wildcard, isn't it?
[2:55:02.020 --> 2:55:13.020]  Right. Right. So if you if you look at what appears to be the, you know, the popular opinion on the ground, you know, my guess is Trump wins.
[2:55:13.020 --> 2:55:17.020]  The polls don't make any sense to me, given what I'm hearing and seeing on the ground.
[2:55:17.020 --> 2:55:25.020]  I agree. Just like last time, it's a fraud. Catherine Fitz, thank you so much. San Francisco tech CEO just issued an email warning of civil war unless you vote Biden.
[2:55:25.020 --> 2:55:47.020]  Wow, we'll cover that and more on the other side. Back in 60 seconds. Thank you, Catherine. And then Dr. Dick baggage takes over. I admire President Trump. He's really proven himself to be unmatched.
[2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:56.020]  His wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy. And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump. He's not God. He's not an angel. He's not perfect.
[2:55:56.020 --> 2:56:03.020]  But the way he has used judo on the forces of the New World Order has been really incredible.
[2:56:03.020 --> 2:56:08.020]  The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom.
[2:56:08.020 --> 2:56:15.020]  And the way he stood up against these America hating, God hating, family hating trash is beautiful.
[2:56:15.020 --> 2:56:20.020]  And I'm serious. I was just bringing tears to my eyes, driving to work, just for thinking about President Trump.
[2:56:20.020 --> 2:56:28.020]  I just want to say I admire the president so much. And I appreciate you, the listeners and everybody for what you've done. I admire you.
[2:56:28.020 --> 2:56:37.020]  That's what you call it. Thank me, folks. I admire you. I admire Trump. I admire all of you that are involved in this fight. And I just wish I could do more.
[2:56:37.020 --> 2:57:03.020]  We're going to win this fight together. This election is so important. Please pray for President Trump.
[2:57:03.020 --> 2:57:10.020]  Now, if you remember, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the Alex Jones show. If you'll remember about a month ago, you can pull it up.
[2:57:10.020 --> 2:57:21.020]  Joe Biden said 200 million Americans died of COVID. That's a little under two thirds. There's about 332 million citizens.
[2:57:21.020 --> 2:57:30.020]  There are 50 million people that are here or naturalized here illegally. So, you know, we're talking 370 plus million people.
[2:57:30.020 --> 2:57:40.020]  Now, if 200 million were dead, that'd be close to two thirds. If 220 million were dead, it's, again, a little above 60%. We've done the math.
[2:57:40.020 --> 2:57:46.020]  But when you look at 220,000 dead from COVID, most of them died of something else. That's been confirmed.
[2:57:46.020 --> 2:58:01.020]  94% had COVID morbidities. Most of the tests were false. They just put it on the different death certificates to get the extra COVID federal financing. 50,000 plus dollars, 52,000 dollars.
[2:58:01.020 --> 2:58:08.020]  So that's all known. But Biden said it twice. And I've seen other media say 200 million died.
[2:58:08.020 --> 2:58:20.020]  Of course, the news told us that 5% was going to die. That would be 15, 16, 17 million people, 18 million, depending on the numbers.
[2:58:20.020 --> 2:58:29.020]  But 18 million people didn't die. But I run into people on the streets that literally scream, FU millions have died. You Russian spy.
[2:58:29.020 --> 2:58:39.020]  Some of it got caught two weeks ago. We were downtown. They're like, ask you, you murdered millions. Millions died. And I ran to somebody who I knew I know is a nice person this morning.
[2:58:39.020 --> 2:58:49.020]  And I said, listen, not one baby has died from COVID. And they started crying. They said, I just don't worry about my baby.
[2:58:49.020 --> 2:58:59.020]  And I said, not one baby's died of COVID. Of some have died that already had serious. One baby in Michigan had its guts outside its body and other one had holes in its heart.
[2:58:59.020 --> 2:59:05.020]  And they just put COVID on the deal. And then they put it all into this. And that's that's the terrorizing the public.
[2:59:05.020 --> 2:59:31.020]  They're not supposed to get between people and their terror and their craziness. You know, when they're lied to by folks like Kamala, slave owner family Harris, who again is walking around saying 220 million people are dead.
[2:59:31.020 --> 2:59:42.020]  Now, can we do a document cam shot or an overhead shot, a skycam shot in the control room, please? I think there's like seven people in there around the show. Can we do a shot of that?
[2:59:42.020 --> 2:59:57.020]  Okay, so there's like 123456. And if you check it with our seven, so there's seven people. So, so if two thirds of them disappear, what's two thirds of seven, four and a half, five.
[2:59:57.020 --> 3:00:07.020]  So imagine that would mean more than half the people in the room died. Does anybody in this building know somebody died of COVID? I've asked no.
[3:00:07.020 --> 3:00:20.020]  Anybody know anybody got sick from it. A few people claim they did. Nobody had a problem. So imagine that claim like that that root Kamala Harris is saying, your TV or you can see it, let's go show this.
[3:00:20.020 --> 3:00:37.020]  Those are ghosts in there. Because Kamala Harris never lies. There are 1234567 people in there. And that can't be possible because my hairs would lie to me. Five of them have got to be dead.
[3:00:37.020 --> 3:00:48.020]  So, John, do you lay down dead on the ground right now, please? There you go. He's dead. All right, Kamala start told her on the ground. All right, for black lives matter to it. All right, there you go.
[3:00:48.020 --> 3:01:00.020]  All right, can we get let's get let's get Kevin on the ground. Kevin switch the show. We can't switch the board of his dad. All right, well, let's just say he's dead.
[3:01:00.020 --> 3:01:18.020]  Point is everyone is dead. Okay. Now it's not true. It's made up. But just they're all dead folks. Because you realize that if 220 million people were dead.
[3:01:18.020 --> 3:01:32.020]  Here, let's put it to you this way. Let's say you had five roommates. Two thirds of your five roommates dead is like three and a half. So let's let's let's all let's round it out.
[3:01:32.020 --> 3:01:41.020]  So the thirds will work. Let's say you have nine roommates. Six of them are dead.
[3:01:41.020 --> 3:01:53.020]  So there's the seven people in the control room. It should be like five or dead. Okay, they're not dead. It didn't happen. And I have to sit here, literally talk to adults. I know and I go listen to me.
[3:01:53.020 --> 3:02:04.020]  220,000 out of 370 million people. We did the math. You guys punch up the calculator. It's like point zero zero zero five something. I mean, it's not even as bad as the flu.
[3:02:04.020 --> 3:02:13.020]  But notice no one died of the flu last year because they were all put in the number of COVID.
[3:02:13.020 --> 3:02:22.020]  And Bill Gates says we're never leaving our houses. So here it is drum roll.
[3:02:22.020 --> 3:02:38.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, not to be outdone by the biggest liar grand champion fraud, China Joe Biden.
[3:02:38.020 --> 3:02:48.020]  He said 200 million died. Well, Kamala Jamaica slave owner Harris, she says 20 extra million died. Here she is.
[3:02:48.020 --> 3:02:56.020]  And we're looking at over 220 million Americans who just in the last several months died.
[3:02:56.020 --> 3:03:03.020]  We're looking at over 220 million Americans who just in the last several months died.
[3:03:03.020 --> 3:03:04.020]  Died? Wow.
[3:03:04.020 --> 3:03:11.020]  We're looking at over 220 million Americans who just in the last several months died.
[3:03:11.020 --> 3:03:16.020]  Here's the thing I'd love to say, oh, she's an idiot. No, this is run by psychiatrists and psychologists.
[3:03:16.020 --> 3:03:21.740]  They're doing this on purpose where I run into people that literally believe we're
[3:03:21.740 --> 3:03:25.540]  like in zombie land and everyone's dead.
[3:03:25.540 --> 3:03:32.220]  Yeah, but the nerve of these people like point in Trump, you put kids in cages when
[3:03:32.220 --> 3:03:33.300]  they did her.
[3:03:33.300 --> 3:03:34.820]  You want to keep blacks in prison.
[3:03:34.820 --> 3:03:37.140]  Drums like I'm the one that got rid of that.
[3:03:37.140 --> 3:03:44.980]  Well, I mean, man, you know what, roll it three more times.
[3:03:44.980 --> 3:03:45.980]  Come on.
[3:03:45.980 --> 3:03:46.980]  It's over and over again.
[3:03:46.980 --> 3:03:52.060]  I may just air this the rest of my life looking at over 220 million Americans who just in
[3:03:52.060 --> 3:03:56.220]  the last several months died.
[3:03:56.220 --> 3:04:04.220]  We're looking at over 220 million Americans who just in the last several months died.
[3:04:04.220 --> 3:04:17.060]  We're looking at over 220 million Americans who just in the last several months died.
[3:04:17.060 --> 3:04:18.660]  Maybe I should just retire right now.
[3:04:18.660 --> 3:04:20.900]  If America wants to buy this, screw you, man.
[3:04:20.900 --> 3:04:25.420]  I mean, that's more than two thirds of the damn country.
[3:04:25.420 --> 3:04:26.700]  I can't handle it anymore.
[3:04:26.700 --> 3:04:30.460]  I can't actually there's 370 million Americans.
[3:04:30.460 --> 3:04:31.460]  People here.
[3:04:31.460 --> 3:04:33.380]  That's actually just about two thirds.
[3:04:33.380 --> 3:04:35.420]  It's just it's right on the line with that.
[3:04:35.420 --> 3:04:37.060]  Why do they keep lying like this?
[3:04:37.060 --> 3:04:38.700]  Why do they keep doing it?
[3:04:38.700 --> 3:04:39.700]  What is the plan?
[3:04:39.700 --> 3:04:40.980]  I'm trying to figure it out.
[3:04:40.980 --> 3:04:42.780]  Maybe she is just so damn stupid.
[3:04:42.780 --> 3:04:47.820]  She looks at a teleprompter and she thinks 220, let me show you 220,000 looks like looks
[3:04:47.820 --> 3:04:48.820]  like this.
[3:04:48.820 --> 3:04:49.820]  We're not okay.
[3:04:49.820 --> 3:04:50.820]  We're not a mathematician.
[3:04:50.820 --> 3:04:53.580]  We all know what 200,000 looks like.
[3:04:53.580 --> 3:05:02.780]  That's what 200,000 looks like to have 370 million people looks like that.
[3:05:02.780 --> 3:05:07.660]  So how does she not know what that is versus that?
[3:05:07.660 --> 3:05:09.380]  And why did Joe Biden say the same thing?
[3:05:09.380 --> 3:05:10.380]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[3:05:10.380 --> 3:05:11.380]  He said 200 million.
[3:05:11.380 --> 3:05:19.020]  She said 200 and God, it's even hard to believe this.
[3:05:19.020 --> 3:05:21.340]  I can't even I give up.
[3:05:21.340 --> 3:05:22.340]  I can't handle it anymore.
[3:05:22.340 --> 3:05:23.940]  These people are doing the same.
[3:05:23.940 --> 3:05:28.420]  That's the thing about their insanity is they wound you with the insanity.
[3:05:28.420 --> 3:05:31.860]  It's like you're like busy when they're lying to you going, what the hell are you talking
[3:05:31.860 --> 3:05:32.860]  about?
[3:05:32.860 --> 3:05:35.660]  And by the time you figure out their line to you, they've already run off of your purse.
[3:05:35.660 --> 3:05:39.220]  They've already run off of your house, your life, your kids, your car.
[3:05:39.220 --> 3:05:40.860]  And I'm just at a certain point, I'm sick of them.
[3:05:40.860 --> 3:05:44.540]  Well, you know what's going to run off with this whole office and the satellite uplink?
[3:05:44.540 --> 3:05:46.860]  If you don't buy our stuff, it's great things.
[3:05:46.860 --> 3:05:50.660]  If you don't get vitamin D and vitamin C, and if you don't get other things, you need
[3:05:50.660 --> 3:05:56.700]  their essential like the items essential to we got that's just as important as the vitamin
[3:05:56.700 --> 3:06:02.260]  D and the zinc and the, and everything in my view info war store.com 30 to 60% off store

[3:07:03.020 --> 3:07:04.580]  then absorbed by the stomach.
[3:07:04.580 --> 3:07:07.180]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[3:07:07.180 --> 3:07:11.260]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates and our first product got

[3:08:43.380 --> 3:09:10.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:10.940 --> 3:09:20.300]  You know, we get to wrap up the fourth hour on a Friday afternoon and I appreciate everyone
[3:09:20.300 --> 3:09:27.540]  that listens and listening to the segments coming into this one, you know, and God, I
[3:09:27.540 --> 3:09:36.300]  love the economic picture by experts and I've lectured with Austin Fitz before and she's
[3:09:36.300 --> 3:09:37.300]  incredible.
[3:09:37.300 --> 3:09:42.580]  You know, I mean, in terms of what she has in a perspective and when you think about
[3:09:42.580 --> 3:09:48.020]  it, it's all the stuff that Alex has been talking about for 25 years that we've been
[3:09:48.020 --> 3:09:54.220]  talking about for 25 years as it relates to technology and privacy and bringing in the
[3:09:54.220 --> 3:09:55.220]  banking dimension.
[3:09:55.220 --> 3:09:59.620]  You know, I recently switched all of my out of all the national banks, I'm out of them.
[3:09:59.620 --> 3:10:02.260]  I'm not doing business with natural banks anymore.
[3:10:02.260 --> 3:10:08.620]  I left Keybank and in my corporation and moved it over to the First National Bank of Alaska
[3:10:08.620 --> 3:10:15.220]  because I know the owners, multi-generational family of bankers, local bankers in my state
[3:10:15.220 --> 3:10:19.860]  that have actually one of the highest rated banks in the country.
[3:10:19.860 --> 3:10:21.980]  So that's what I did and they're local.
[3:10:21.980 --> 3:10:22.980]  They're in my neighborhood.
[3:10:22.980 --> 3:10:28.300]  I actually have a relationship with a person, not a computer, and I appreciate that.
[3:10:28.300 --> 3:10:33.740]  And I think that's what we need more of, face-to-face personal relationships, whether
[3:10:33.740 --> 3:10:40.980]  it's with our banker, our sister, our friends, whoever it is, and it's my sister's birthday
[3:10:40.980 --> 3:10:46.580]  today, Michelle, in Kansas, and you know, shout out to her too.
[3:10:46.580 --> 3:10:52.100]  You know, when I think about all of what we're seeing in the country and I had a wild week
[3:10:52.100 --> 3:11:00.860]  this week, I flew down to shoot a segment called America's Book of Secrets.
[3:11:00.860 --> 3:11:06.020]  I did a segment for them on the whole issue of personal privacy and surveillance.
[3:11:06.020 --> 3:11:08.300]  That's going to come out soon.
[3:11:08.300 --> 3:11:11.940]  A really important segment and I appreciate it, what they did.
[3:11:11.940 --> 3:11:13.660]  I hope that they run something decent.
[3:11:13.660 --> 3:11:17.340]  You never know until it's done, but we'll see.
[3:11:17.340 --> 3:11:24.100]  And thinking about the recommendations, you know, bank locally, we heard that in the last
[3:11:24.100 --> 3:11:27.100]  segment, homeschooling your kids, educating your kids.
[3:11:27.100 --> 3:11:29.020]  A lot of people don't know this about my background.
[3:11:29.020 --> 3:11:34.620]  I was twice elected president of the Alaska Federation of Teachers, twice elected vice-president
[3:11:34.620 --> 3:11:35.620]  of political affairs.
[3:11:35.620 --> 3:11:38.180]  I was elected to the Anchorage Council of Education.
[3:11:38.180 --> 3:11:43.300]  I never taught, I'll tell you that in the classroom as a classroom, I teach every Friday
[3:11:43.300 --> 3:11:44.700]  afternoon here.
[3:11:44.700 --> 3:11:50.580]  But the point is, as a head of a teacher's organization, a statewide teacher's organization,
[3:11:50.580 --> 3:11:52.700]  I support parental choice.
[3:11:52.700 --> 3:11:56.900]  What we used to call vouchers, I don't like the word because too many bad press, let's
[3:11:56.900 --> 3:11:57.900]  create a new narrative.
[3:11:57.900 --> 3:12:02.620]  Let's call it parental choice in education because now even liberals get it with their
[3:12:02.620 --> 3:12:08.540]  kids locked up at home and them locked up with them, try to educate maybe two or three
[3:12:08.540 --> 3:12:14.420]  kids, you know, try that, try a few grade levels at home without a curriculum and without
[3:12:14.420 --> 3:12:16.260]  a system to support it.
[3:12:16.260 --> 3:12:20.220]  If you get a homeschooling curriculum and you look at them, they're actually really,
[3:12:20.220 --> 3:12:21.220]  really excellent.
[3:12:21.220 --> 3:12:25.340]  You can get the tactical kind, you know, with real books, remember those things?
[3:12:25.340 --> 3:12:29.060]  Those are pre-screened items, you know, a book.
[3:12:29.060 --> 3:12:31.060]  They still come with books.
[3:12:31.060 --> 3:12:32.500]  You can do that.
[3:12:32.500 --> 3:12:35.460]  You can take it a step further.
[3:12:35.460 --> 3:12:39.580]  If you can get a group together, maybe get a tutor involved, assist you, you can get
[3:12:39.580 --> 3:12:42.540]  the same grade level if the public system is failing you.
[3:12:42.540 --> 3:12:48.620]  But the real deal is, like here in Alaska, the classroom of about 20 is a quarter of
[3:12:48.620 --> 3:12:51.620]  a million dollars for 20 kids in the classroom.
[3:12:51.620 --> 3:12:52.620]  That's the average.
[3:12:52.620 --> 3:12:57.500]  That doesn't include transportation, capital construction, student nutrition, none of that,
[3:12:57.500 --> 3:13:00.660]  special education, none of that, that's extra.
[3:13:00.660 --> 3:13:03.340]  Just the core, right?
[3:13:03.340 --> 3:13:05.020]  Quarter of a million per classroom.
[3:13:05.020 --> 3:13:08.940]  And I ask everyone in America, are you getting your money's worth?
[3:13:08.940 --> 3:13:14.940]  The answer would be, uniformly no, give the money to parents to reprogram and you can go
[3:13:14.940 --> 3:13:19.620]  spend it if you think you're getting your money's worth from the public system or see
[3:13:19.620 --> 3:13:25.220]  what kind of competition arises when you get your choice and your power back.
[3:13:25.220 --> 3:13:26.940]  See, it's all about that, right?
[3:13:26.940 --> 3:13:31.860]  The government wants to take your power, remove your power, collect up all the power and your
[3:13:31.860 --> 3:13:38.700]  money and your labor and your livelihood and strip you of your dignity and your humanity
[3:13:38.700 --> 3:13:41.980]  and brainwash your children.
[3:13:41.980 --> 3:13:47.820]  And this is the foundation of it and the last hour, you know, brings us back into focus.
[3:13:47.820 --> 3:13:50.140]  You know, what are the important things?
[3:13:50.140 --> 3:13:55.180]  But I want to twist this just a little further, because what we talked about in that last
[3:13:55.180 --> 3:13:56.180]  hour, what do we hear?
[3:13:56.180 --> 3:13:59.580]  We heard about budgeting your life.
[3:13:59.580 --> 3:14:00.580]  We did.
[3:14:00.580 --> 3:14:01.580]  We heard it.
[3:14:01.580 --> 3:14:04.900]  If you listen carefully, you heard about budgeting your life and figuring out how much money
[3:14:04.900 --> 3:14:08.180]  it takes to do that life.
[3:14:08.180 --> 3:14:15.020]  This is the way to live, ladies and gentlemen, to not fall into the trap of being identified
[3:14:15.020 --> 3:14:19.540]  as only a consumer, a taxpayer or whatever.
[3:14:19.540 --> 3:14:26.540]  You are a human being, a living soul with a life that at this particular dimension called
[3:14:26.540 --> 3:14:29.580]  planet Earth is finite.
[3:14:29.580 --> 3:14:35.340]  This part, this snapshot in between interviews with the creator of everything.
[3:14:35.340 --> 3:14:42.220]  But in this snapshot that we're living, we should budget how we want to live, what we
[3:14:42.220 --> 3:14:46.540]  want to do, how we want to see the world and then figure out how much money that might
[3:14:46.540 --> 3:14:51.820]  take to do that and make it realistic, okay, something you can believe in.
[3:14:51.820 --> 3:14:53.140]  Don't do the impossible here.
[3:14:53.140 --> 3:14:54.420]  I've talked about that before.
[3:14:54.420 --> 3:15:00.980]  Do what you can believe in, what is possible for you and map out a life and figure out
[3:15:00.980 --> 3:15:03.620]  what does it take to get there.
[3:15:03.620 --> 3:15:08.060]  And then see what parts of it could you take back that you're dependent on others.
[3:15:08.060 --> 3:15:09.380]  Can you take back your energy?
[3:15:09.380 --> 3:15:13.380]  Do you have hydroelectric close by that you can do yourself?
[3:15:13.380 --> 3:15:14.380]  Do you have solar?
[3:15:14.380 --> 3:15:15.380]  Do you have wind?
[3:15:15.380 --> 3:15:16.980]  Do you have some way to get off that part of the grid?
[3:15:16.980 --> 3:15:18.740]  Do you have the ability to grow your own food?
[3:15:18.740 --> 3:15:19.740]  Do you even know how?
[3:15:19.740 --> 3:15:23.780]  Can you get a good book and keep it on the shelf, figure it out and start compiling that
[3:15:23.780 --> 3:15:29.660]  which you need to regain your independence, which is your life.
[3:15:29.660 --> 3:15:34.460]  Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness means you get your time back.
[3:15:34.460 --> 3:15:41.860]  You see, you've been shoved into the pod, the cubicle, the hamster wheel, the BS, ladies
[3:15:41.860 --> 3:15:48.140]  and gentlemen, that's being sold to all of us as fertilizer for life.
[3:15:48.140 --> 3:15:54.100]  And now we can all get along in this squishy co-op of squishiness.
[3:15:54.100 --> 3:15:59.220]  See they're trying to duplicate in the physical what already exists in the non-physical called
[3:15:59.220 --> 3:16:01.060]  consciousness.
[3:16:01.060 --> 3:16:06.660]  We're connected that way already and then we're independent as living souls occupying
[3:16:06.660 --> 3:16:08.060]  individual carriers.
[3:16:08.060 --> 3:16:16.140]  We call bodies and we get to go create something, do something, be something, not be nothing.
[3:16:16.140 --> 3:16:21.620]  And this is what we keep hearing from way too many quarters that we're nothing and we're
[3:16:21.620 --> 3:16:31.300]  not every living soul is someone, not just a someone.
[3:16:31.300 --> 3:16:37.300]  If you could just see the potential, if you could just see the energy that encompasses
[3:16:37.300 --> 3:16:41.580]  the atoms within one living soul and what you could do, if you could just learn to redirect
[3:16:41.580 --> 3:16:45.260]  a little bit of that, a little different.
[3:16:45.260 --> 3:16:50.660]  And claim your birthright as a co-creator, created in the image and likeness of God to
[3:16:50.660 --> 3:16:56.220]  do something decent in the world and not cower in fear, shaking in your boots, worrying
[3:16:56.220 --> 3:16:58.900]  about what's going to happen tomorrow.
[3:16:58.900 --> 3:17:04.140]  Take possession of today, your life, what's possible for you, step into it, begin doing
[3:17:04.140 --> 3:17:09.700]  it and do it in the context of the world we're in, not some fiction being shoved down our
[3:17:09.700 --> 3:17:14.540]  throat by the media because that's the brainwash, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:17:14.540 --> 3:17:18.380]  We need to clean it up, refocus our attention.
[3:17:18.380 --> 3:17:20.220]  We're in the info war.
[3:17:20.220 --> 3:17:27.460]  The two weeks before the final event in this info war, this is Dr. Nick Begich this Friday
[3:17:27.460 --> 3:17:28.460]  afternoon.
[3:17:28.460 --> 3:17:35.060]  Check out our website, EarthPulse.com, E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-C, EarthPulse.com and we'll be right back
[3:17:35.060 --> 3:17:38.940]  after these three questions.
[3:17:38.940 --> 3:17:44.460]  Vitamin mineral fusion and ultra-12 are now back in stock after being sold out for months.
[3:17:44.460 --> 3:17:48.620]  They're sold out because people know that high quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins,
[3:17:48.620 --> 3:17:53.940]  minerals, especially zinc boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your
[3:17:53.940 --> 3:17:55.580]  immune system well.
[3:17:55.580 --> 3:18:01.300]  Both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com, just two weeks after the election, and we're
[3:18:01.300 --> 3:18:07.500]  offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple patriot points at your next order.
[3:18:07.500 --> 3:18:11.860]  Also, if you sign up for auto shipping, an additional 10% off, that makes many of the
[3:18:11.860 --> 3:18:13.580]  things we're selling lost leaders.
[3:18:13.580 --> 3:18:17.660]  Now, we have had a big clearance sale going, so a lot of stuff sold out, a lot of the other
[3:18:17.660 --> 3:18:21.140]  stuff is close to selling out, but some of our best sellers are still there and some
[3:18:21.140 --> 3:18:24.620]  of them have actually come back in to stock and because of your support, we've had the
[3:18:24.620 --> 3:18:28.860]  money to reorder and get the other things that have actually sold out, so those should
[3:18:28.860 --> 3:18:30.340]  be back in stock as well soon.
[3:18:30.340 --> 3:18:32.900]  Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the air.
[3:18:32.900 --> 3:18:38.380]  Obviously, we're critical to fight and you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[3:18:38.380 --> 3:18:41.740]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[3:18:41.740 --> 3:18:43.740]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[3:18:43.740 --> 3:18:47.500]  Is your city too safe?
[3:18:47.500 --> 3:18:53.740]  Well, not anymore, introducing Democrats, politicians so incompetent they'll fill your
[3:18:53.740 --> 3:19:00.540]  neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness.
[3:19:00.540 --> 3:19:05.580]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[3:19:05.580 --> 3:19:11.900]  No more pesky law and order when Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[3:19:11.900 --> 3:19:16.500]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[3:19:16.500 --> 3:19:22.780]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[3:19:22.780 --> 3:19:27.380]  cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes.
[3:19:27.380 --> 3:19:31.820]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[3:19:31.820 --> 3:19:44.380]  COVID rollout has been extremely well planned, very well thought out and has been incrementally
[3:19:44.380 --> 3:19:45.380]  orchestrated.
[3:19:45.380 --> 3:19:48.700]  First, it's 15 days to keep the hospital's empty, that's all life.
[3:19:48.700 --> 3:19:51.260]  Then it's two months, then it's six months, then it's a year.
[3:19:51.260 --> 3:19:56.060]  Now Bill Gates has 10 years and people are not saying, I like my mask, I like my face
[3:19:56.060 --> 3:19:58.700]  diaper, I like my binky.
[3:19:58.700 --> 3:20:03.820]  And so getting into the fear, getting into the hysteria, getting into all the exaggerated
[3:20:03.820 --> 3:20:11.980]  death numbers, this is our new neurotic control freak society overseen by robots, overseen by
[3:20:11.980 --> 3:20:16.860]  AI, and all of it is designed to make humans non-essential.
[3:20:16.860 --> 3:20:24.180]  That's why out of the Gates they tell us, you are non-essential, you are non-essential.
[3:20:24.180 --> 3:20:29.140]  Your company, your restaurant, your job, your profession is non-essential.
[3:20:29.140 --> 3:20:35.500]  This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated, and Bill Gates sits on top of it.
[3:20:35.500 --> 3:20:41.420]  Come on folks, let's reject this.
[3:20:41.420 --> 3:20:59.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:59.540 --> 3:21:10.700]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind with Nick Begich.
[3:21:10.700 --> 3:21:11.700]  And welcome back.
[3:21:11.700 --> 3:21:17.300]  You know, it happens every time, you know, I come in, I'm ready for the show, I got
[3:21:17.300 --> 3:21:23.220]  all my notes laid out, you know, and my bullet points I want to cover, and it just goes a
[3:21:23.220 --> 3:21:26.700]  different direction most of the time.
[3:21:26.700 --> 3:21:32.580]  But I appreciate that direction because it does the spirit move me quite frankly, and
[3:21:32.580 --> 3:21:33.580]  it's how I function.
[3:21:33.580 --> 3:21:37.580]  If people say, think before you speak, and I don't even know what that means, you know,
[3:21:37.580 --> 3:21:39.500]  because I just speak.
[3:21:39.500 --> 3:21:45.020]  And here's the thing about it is, that's what we should expect in oratory from whoever
[3:21:45.020 --> 3:21:46.740]  wants to lead the nation, right?
[3:21:46.740 --> 3:21:51.740]  We ought to be able to expect, they don't need a teleprompter, they can just get up,
[3:21:51.740 --> 3:21:57.500]  pour out the core of themselves, and they don't make mistakes in what they say, okay?
[3:21:57.500 --> 3:22:02.100]  Or at least it represents, it's not a mistake, that's what I'm saying.
[3:22:02.100 --> 3:22:04.100]  If it works that way, you really get it.
[3:22:04.100 --> 3:22:09.580]  So what they call a gaffe, that's not a gaffe, that's what they are about.
[3:22:09.580 --> 3:22:13.340]  You know, that is how the truth rolls out of them.
[3:22:13.340 --> 3:22:18.220]  You see, this is what often is forgotten in all of that.
[3:22:18.220 --> 3:22:22.020]  So here's the problem, you know, and they go to, here's how to debate, you know, you
[3:22:22.020 --> 3:22:26.140]  want to do an hour and a half debate, pick six topics, give them each 10 minutes.
[3:22:26.140 --> 3:22:30.340]  You get 10, the other guy gets 10, you get two minutes to rebut, two minutes to rebut.
[3:22:30.340 --> 3:22:36.940]  If you can't talk for 10 minutes about anything, anything facing the nation, you shouldn't
[3:22:36.940 --> 3:22:39.060]  be running for public office, right?
[3:22:39.060 --> 3:22:42.660]  I mean, really, really.
[3:22:42.660 --> 3:22:47.900]  The qualification first should be, you should be able to articulate the national problems
[3:22:47.900 --> 3:22:52.020]  and your solutions, and actually have a plan that's bigger than a slogan.
[3:22:52.020 --> 3:22:54.980]  And most of these guys don't have a plan, and then they don't have a clue.
[3:22:54.980 --> 3:23:00.500]  At the local level, you want to talk about disaster, you know, you have some really good
[3:23:00.500 --> 3:23:01.500]  people, okay?
[3:23:01.500 --> 3:23:05.820]  I want to say that up front, and first of all, but they're not in the majority, they're
[3:23:05.820 --> 3:23:06.820]  in the minority.
[3:23:06.820 --> 3:23:12.300]  It has a really good public servants that get the picture, but they're in the minority
[3:23:12.300 --> 3:23:13.300]  right now.
[3:23:13.300 --> 3:23:18.260]  The others are a bunch of used cars, salesmen, real estate agents, not to say anything bad
[3:23:18.260 --> 3:23:23.580]  about those professions, but you might want to have a little broader perspective on the
[3:23:23.580 --> 3:23:27.900]  world today if you want to serve in public office and represent us, because you're the
[3:23:27.900 --> 3:23:29.140]  proxy for us.
[3:23:29.140 --> 3:23:30.500]  That's called representative government.
[3:23:30.500 --> 3:23:35.060]  That's what this Democratic Republic is all about, and everybody wants to go, I don't
[3:23:35.060 --> 3:23:36.060]  know what it's about.
[3:23:36.060 --> 3:23:39.540]  You know, I was taught on CNN, taught on Fox.
[3:23:39.540 --> 3:23:40.540]  You know what?
[3:23:40.540 --> 3:23:46.340]  The mainstream is the lame stream all the way around in terms of delivery of information.
[3:23:46.340 --> 3:23:47.940]  You have to go out and collect it.
[3:23:47.940 --> 3:23:51.700]  Don't just take what we say here, go look it up.
[3:23:51.700 --> 3:23:56.140]  You know, look it up and research yourself, and don't go into the pigeonholes you normally
[3:23:56.140 --> 3:23:57.140]  do.
[3:23:57.140 --> 3:23:58.620]  Try a library and books.
[3:23:58.620 --> 3:24:02.060]  See, every of these cabinets are all full of books.
[3:24:02.060 --> 3:24:03.060]  I pop them open.
[3:24:03.060 --> 3:24:06.380]  You know, they're all by subject, and they're all organized, and they're all labeled, you
[3:24:06.380 --> 3:24:12.300]  know, like a library, like the track of what I'm doing, you know, and here's the point.
[3:24:12.300 --> 3:24:19.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have an opportunity in two weeks to begin the take back of America,
[3:24:19.460 --> 3:24:25.260]  and the stopping, you've got to put a bicycle, you know, the bicycle's running down the mountain,
[3:24:25.260 --> 3:24:30.460]  and what we have to do is take and put a wrench in the spoke and stop, which is like
[3:24:30.460 --> 3:24:34.260]  what my second grade teacher used to call the rude awakening.
[3:24:34.260 --> 3:24:38.620]  Yeah, the world needs a rude awakening in terms of the globalist.
[3:24:38.620 --> 3:24:41.580]  Boom, let them fly over the handlebar.
[3:24:41.580 --> 3:24:46.140]  But think about what was being said in the last hour, you know, and I want to give a
[3:24:46.140 --> 3:24:48.060]  little more perspective.
[3:24:48.060 --> 3:24:54.420]  Like you're China, okay, and you're the US, okay, or you're Israel, or you're Russia,
[3:24:54.420 --> 3:25:00.940]  or you're anybody with a big budget, a bomber today, a modern bomber will cost you one,
[3:25:00.940 --> 3:25:08.860]  maybe $2 billion, billion, billion dollars, you know, $1,000 million, okay, so you can
[3:25:08.860 --> 3:25:11.340]  do this with that kind of money.
[3:25:11.340 --> 3:25:20.100]  You can buy the bomber, or you can find a guy like Epstein and give him maybe $500 million,
[3:25:20.100 --> 3:25:26.900]  a fraction of the price of one bomber, and then you can get him to corrupt a whole bunch
[3:25:26.900 --> 3:25:30.780]  of living souls that happen to occupy public office.
[3:25:30.780 --> 3:25:32.820]  Oh, what a deal.
[3:25:32.820 --> 3:25:38.420]  See, when I was taught organizing, you know, classical organizing, one of the key elements
[3:25:38.420 --> 3:25:43.620]  is called co-option, where you take the leadership, see, if you can co-opt the leadership, move
[3:25:43.620 --> 3:25:50.460]  over to your panel, then you got the public just riding along with you, or whatever group
[3:25:50.460 --> 3:25:54.060]  it is you're co-opting, see, this is classical organizing.
[3:25:54.060 --> 3:25:59.340]  But think about it on a governmental global scale, you know, on a big commercial scale
[3:25:59.340 --> 3:26:03.340]  where you're an individual businessman with billions and billions and billions like Bill
[3:26:03.340 --> 3:26:06.780]  Gates or someone else.
[3:26:06.780 --> 3:26:11.820]  You know, Bozo, think about it for a moment.
[3:26:11.820 --> 3:26:15.740]  At some point, money means nothing when you have that much.
[3:26:15.740 --> 3:26:20.620]  Now, it's tough for any of us to figure that out, because we're not there, okay?
[3:26:20.620 --> 3:26:24.340]  But when you're there, and some of us are, if you're just retired and so scaredy and
[3:26:24.340 --> 3:26:29.540]  you live on a decent budget, and all of a sudden, you've got your life back, your time
[3:26:29.540 --> 3:26:34.620]  back, what I was talking about in the last segment, you own your future again, and you're
[3:26:34.620 --> 3:26:35.820]  off the hamster wheel.
[3:26:35.820 --> 3:26:40.020]  Well, when you're Bill Gates or you're a Rockefeller, because when the Rockefeller
[3:26:40.020 --> 3:26:45.140]  Foundation started, it was the same year that income tax started, that's when nonprofits
[3:26:45.140 --> 3:26:46.140]  got created.
[3:26:46.140 --> 3:26:50.980]  See, because it wasn't about money, for these guys at that point, it was about power, and
[3:26:50.980 --> 3:26:56.620]  if you could throw all your money into a nonprofit with some great public good, you see, then
[3:26:56.620 --> 3:27:03.060]  you don't pay any taxes, you ride for free, free, just like the Monopoly game, you know,
[3:27:03.060 --> 3:27:09.420]  go Pesco, ride for free, and that's the Rockefeller Railroad, ladies and gentlemen, that started
[3:27:09.420 --> 3:27:11.860]  in 1913 with the income tax.
[3:27:11.860 --> 3:27:17.380]  It used to be before that, the day before that, that was involuntary servitude, that
[3:27:17.380 --> 3:27:22.900]  was the slavery we keep hearing about in the media, but it was all of us enslaved, and
[3:27:22.900 --> 3:27:26.620]  then they made it legal, all the states said, yeah, I think income tax is only going to
[3:27:26.620 --> 3:27:33.020]  be the wealthy, the same rhetoric we're hearing now, 107 years later, from the same BSers,
[3:27:33.020 --> 3:27:37.700]  feeding us BS and telling us it's fertilizer when it's not.
[3:27:37.700 --> 3:27:41.580]  When you have billions and billions and you cheat the American public, because now your
[3:27:41.580 --> 3:27:45.980]  tax exempt, and that's what we're talking about here, do you believe in their agenda,
[3:27:45.980 --> 3:27:50.380]  but you're paying for it, you're subsidizing it, because they enjoy all the great things
[3:27:50.380 --> 3:27:54.740]  about this country that you and I enjoy, but they ride for free.
[3:27:54.740 --> 3:27:58.940]  Now, some of them have a public good you agree with, and some of them public good you don't
[3:27:58.940 --> 3:28:01.820]  agree with, but we're all paying for all of it.
[3:28:01.820 --> 3:28:05.660]  You're paying for Planned Parenthood, whether you know it or not.
[3:28:05.660 --> 3:28:09.740]  You're paying for the Rockefeller Foundation, the Gates Foundation, whether you know it
[3:28:09.740 --> 3:28:14.260]  or not, and Providence Hospital and the Good Sisters of Providence, whether you know it
[3:28:14.260 --> 3:28:21.500]  or not, and maybe your local church, and maybe Southern Baptist Convention, maybe a lot of
[3:28:21.500 --> 3:28:26.020]  different organizations, whether you believe in them or not.
[3:28:26.020 --> 3:28:27.020]  Should you?
[3:28:27.020 --> 3:28:28.020]  Is it right?
[3:28:28.020 --> 3:28:36.100]  But let's think about the power some of these organizations wield, laying churches out of
[3:28:36.100 --> 3:28:40.860]  the game, because that's a whole other area of the Constitution, but commercial business
[3:28:40.860 --> 3:28:46.940]  interest in individuals, they get free speech like a human being, but nobody goes to jail
[3:28:46.940 --> 3:28:50.740]  when they stomp on you, right?
[3:28:50.740 --> 3:28:55.140]  None of these boards of directors and officers in these corporations go to jail, because
[3:28:55.140 --> 3:29:00.980]  that's why they're corporations or LLCs or some other insulating structure that makes
[3:29:00.980 --> 3:29:02.980]  you personally not liable.
[3:29:02.980 --> 3:29:03.980]  You escape.
[3:29:03.980 --> 3:29:04.980]  You don't go to jail.
[3:29:04.980 --> 3:29:05.980]  You don't go to prison.
[3:29:05.980 --> 3:29:07.580]  You don't have any real threat against you.
[3:29:07.580 --> 3:29:11.660]  We need to change that, you see, because if they're going to have the same rights as
[3:29:11.660 --> 3:29:16.620]  a living soul, except they get eternity on earth because corporations don't die like
[3:29:16.620 --> 3:29:22.020]  the rest of us, then they're boards of directors and they're other breathing organisms that
[3:29:22.020 --> 3:29:27.740]  run the show need to go to jail when they violate you and me and our personal privacy
[3:29:27.740 --> 3:29:31.860]  and our liberty or our civil rights to the extent in which they have.
[3:29:31.860 --> 3:29:40.580]  You see, because controlling our speech, kicking in our digital doorways, invading our personal
[3:29:40.580 --> 3:29:46.620]  privacy or violations of the very essence of who we are and to push us along and manipulate
[3:29:46.620 --> 3:29:53.620]  us with their techniques on the most sophisticated of levels and the simple, basic animalistic
[3:29:53.620 --> 3:29:57.700]  levels that are used to push us around.
[3:29:57.700 --> 3:30:06.820]  Why are we allowing that push, inquire, look inside long enough, start asking yourself
[3:30:06.820 --> 3:30:13.340]  the critical questions, trusting yourself enough to dig out the critical answers and
[3:30:13.340 --> 3:30:19.700]  quit taking the propaganda feed from the mainstream media to be pushed around?
[3:30:19.700 --> 3:30:20.700]  Like so much cattle.
[3:30:20.700 --> 3:30:22.580]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[3:30:22.580 --> 3:30:24.060]  Support the Impal Wars.
[3:30:24.060 --> 3:30:28.180]  Dial in right now to the Impal Wars store and support this network.
[3:30:28.180 --> 3:30:30.300]  That's how we stay in the game.
[3:30:30.300 --> 3:30:31.620]  Support the Impal Wars store.
[3:30:31.620 --> 3:30:32.620]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[3:30:32.620 --> 3:30:37.620]  We'll be right back.
[3:30:37.620 --> 3:30:40.980]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[3:30:40.980 --> 3:30:45.320]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[3:30:45.320 --> 3:30:50.020]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[3:30:50.020 --> 3:30:54.540]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfalWarsStore.com.
[3:30:54.540 --> 3:30:59.340]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[3:30:59.340 --> 3:31:05.060]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[3:31:05.060 --> 3:31:10.860]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[3:31:10.860 --> 3:31:17.660]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[3:31:17.660 --> 3:31:22.260]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[3:31:22.260 --> 3:31:28.060]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[3:31:28.060 --> 3:31:30.860]  facts that pertain to reality.
[3:31:30.860 --> 3:32:00.820]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfaWarsStore.com.
[3:32:00.820 --> 3:32:03.140]  That makes many of these items lost leaders.
[3:32:03.140 --> 3:32:06.700]  Now, a lot of stuff sold out, some of our best sellers are still there, but some good
[3:32:06.700 --> 3:32:07.700]  news.
[3:32:07.700 --> 3:32:11.140]  Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of zinc and all the other vitamins and minerals
[3:32:11.140 --> 3:32:15.100]  and amino acids for adults and children that boost your body's natural defenses.
[3:32:15.100 --> 3:32:19.820]  It is back and stocked back on sale today, which is two weeks to the election, and more
[3:32:19.820 --> 3:32:20.820]  good news.
[3:32:20.820 --> 3:32:26.900]  Ultra-12, it's got the name Ultra for a reason, highest quality Vibeon B12, take it under,
[3:32:26.900 --> 3:32:29.940]  the tongue for full absorption, it is now back in stock.
[3:32:29.940 --> 3:32:35.100]  Both of those are 50% off at InfaWarsStore.com, InfaWarsStore.com.
[3:32:35.100 --> 3:32:38.740]  Black Friday comes in October.
[3:32:38.740 --> 3:32:45.100]  InfaWars is a archetypal classic example of free independent organic resistance against
[3:32:45.100 --> 3:32:46.100]  tyranny.
[3:32:46.100 --> 3:32:51.620]  You built InfaWars, you spread the word, you prayed for us, you bought the products,
[3:32:51.620 --> 3:32:56.980]  you called in, you made recommendations, InfaWars is as much yours as it is mine, and that's
[3:32:56.980 --> 3:33:02.300]  why the enemy is so upset that under the de-platforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the
[3:33:02.300 --> 3:33:07.420]  attack, in many ways, we've become stronger with banned.video, redesigned InfaWars with
[3:33:07.420 --> 3:33:14.900]  all of our great crew, with documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day.
[3:33:14.900 --> 3:33:17.140]  We are the resistance, you are the resistance.
[3:33:17.140 --> 3:33:22.460]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about
[3:33:22.460 --> 3:33:27.260]  it and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together.
[3:33:27.260 --> 3:33:31.020]  It's not just a national treasure, it's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and
[3:33:31.020 --> 3:33:33.020]  they know it and they can't stand it.
[3:33:33.020 --> 3:33:36.580]  And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together.
[3:33:36.580 --> 3:34:06.540]  That's why I salute you all.
[3:34:07.580 --> 3:34:13.500]  the system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[3:34:13.500 --> 3:34:17.620]  Trump has finally figured this out and since he's gonna take action, once reelected, he
[3:34:17.620 --> 3:34:19.740]  gets big tech and then he's modern in the situation.
[3:34:19.740 --> 3:34:22.940]  Well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're gonna sit here and cry because
[3:34:22.940 --> 3:34:24.140]  he has taken action.
[3:34:24.140 --> 3:34:28.520]  We the people are taking action now and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020
[3:34:28.520 --> 3:34:34.140]  electionstutter.com, 2020electionstutter.com and checking out the new redesigned InfaWars.com
[3:34:34.140 --> 3:34:35.140]  and sharing that link.
[3:34:35.140 --> 3:34:37.140]  I'm actually obsessed, oh yeah.
[3:35:05.780 --> 3:35:10.660]  the Alex Jones show.
[3:35:10.660 --> 3:35:11.660]  And welcome back.
[3:35:11.660 --> 3:35:12.660]  It's good to be here.
[3:35:12.660 --> 3:35:18.580]  You know, during the break, talking to the team and we got such a great team down there
[3:35:18.580 --> 3:35:19.580]  in Austin.
[3:35:19.580 --> 3:35:26.180]  I want to remind people to support the InfaWars now more than ever, InfaWarsStore.com.
[3:35:26.180 --> 3:35:28.660]  Go there and support the network.
[3:35:28.660 --> 3:35:30.380]  The supplements are great.
[3:35:30.380 --> 3:35:31.860]  Get on the auto ship.
[3:35:31.860 --> 3:35:38.540]  Get involved in what we're doing by improving your own health and wellness, you know, in
[3:35:38.540 --> 3:35:41.420]  the last segments in the last hour.
[3:35:41.420 --> 3:35:44.820]  Strong body, strong mind, strong soul, you know, start there.
[3:35:44.820 --> 3:35:49.700]  So InfaWars supports that 100% and I do as well.
[3:35:49.700 --> 3:35:53.740]  You know, when I was talking about the last segment, I was thinking about the three B's,
[3:35:53.740 --> 3:36:00.940]  you know, bribery, blackmail and BS, the globalist platform for getting things done.
[3:36:00.940 --> 3:36:05.740]  And bribery we see in a lot of different forms and it gets a lot of nice names these days,
[3:36:05.740 --> 3:36:09.820]  you know, contributions, donations, whatever you want to call it, but it gets you the same
[3:36:09.820 --> 3:36:10.820]  thing.
[3:36:10.820 --> 3:36:15.700]  It's about power and shuffling it around in a bag full of money and some has a cashier's
[3:36:15.700 --> 3:36:19.220]  check in a committee behind it, some of it doesn't.
[3:36:19.220 --> 3:36:22.340]  But here's the important thing to remember, it results in the same thing.
[3:36:22.340 --> 3:36:28.060]  It doesn't matter what the words are that frame the narrative, which is just aggravates
[3:36:28.060 --> 3:36:30.140]  me that we even think in these terms.
[3:36:30.140 --> 3:36:34.980]  We're not writing a script, ladies and gentlemen, we're not doing a narrative.
[3:36:34.980 --> 3:36:41.020]  We're living a life, all of us individually, collectively, making something happen.
[3:36:41.020 --> 3:36:46.660]  And the bribery side of it, the manipulation side of it, and then the blackmail side of
[3:36:46.660 --> 3:36:47.660]  it.
[3:36:47.660 --> 3:36:50.740]  I mean, think about Biden, you know, I mean, I was talking about this lack segment.
[3:36:50.740 --> 3:36:58.980]  For China or Israel or the US or any other country, it takes a 500 million and dedicate
[3:36:58.980 --> 3:37:04.460]  it to corruption, you know, how many national leaders of how many countries can you buy
[3:37:04.460 --> 3:37:06.020]  for that kind of money?
[3:37:06.020 --> 3:37:07.020]  A lot.
[3:37:07.020 --> 3:37:11.420]  You save a lot of bombs, bullets, you know, read the art of war.
[3:37:11.420 --> 3:37:14.220]  I have it behind me on the shelf.
[3:37:14.220 --> 3:37:18.620]  Read the art of war and you'll find out what the Chinese philosophy is, use your opponent's
[3:37:18.620 --> 3:37:21.020]  strength against them.
[3:37:21.020 --> 3:37:26.420]  And another very big principle, and this would be capitalism if you haven't noticed.
[3:37:26.420 --> 3:37:32.100]  The other one is you try and win a battle with not ever firing a shot.
[3:37:32.100 --> 3:37:36.940]  Pay attention, ladies and gentlemen, we got people, socialists in the streets, they took
[3:37:36.940 --> 3:37:41.660]  over the Democratic Party, who's happy about that?
[3:37:41.660 --> 3:37:47.140]  China is, because they haven't changed their political philosophy one bit.
[3:37:47.140 --> 3:37:49.180]  And so they bought the Biden family.
[3:37:49.180 --> 3:37:54.460]  Hide in Biden, yeah, go to your basement and cower in fear because you might open your
[3:37:54.460 --> 3:38:00.420]  mouth and your core might actually speak to the public in a way we would all, you reject,
[3:38:00.420 --> 3:38:08.340]  throw back, you know, being, okay, and I'll be fair too, on the other side, I'm voting
[3:38:08.340 --> 3:38:09.340]  for Trump.
[3:38:09.340 --> 3:38:15.420]  I don't like his style a lot of times, okay, I don't, it's not my style, but I'm voting
[3:38:15.420 --> 3:38:16.420]  for him.
[3:38:16.420 --> 3:38:21.860]  And the reason I'm voting for him is because sometimes America needs someone who will carry
[3:38:21.860 --> 3:38:22.860]  a big stick.
[3:38:22.860 --> 3:38:28.780]  And Teddy Roosevelt did, carrying a big stick, you know, and he didn't start any wars.
[3:38:28.780 --> 3:38:32.980]  This one, Trump, he didn't start any, he's trying to shut them down because they were
[3:38:32.980 --> 3:38:39.940]  all false wars on lies, fake news, you know, think of the Iraq war and weapons of mass
[3:38:39.940 --> 3:38:46.260]  destruction and how many trillions flew out of our economy into Halliburton's hands and
[3:38:46.260 --> 3:38:54.140]  a whole bunch of global sands who continue to benefit by that, corruption, corruption,
[3:38:54.140 --> 3:38:58.820]  ladies and gentlemen, because look at it for what it does and how it works, not the nice
[3:38:58.820 --> 3:39:08.460]  names or how we slant it or how we cover it in regulation and hide it under law.
[3:39:08.460 --> 3:39:14.100]  Not about that, about truth, what is done?
[3:39:14.100 --> 3:39:16.260]  How does it play out?
[3:39:16.260 --> 3:39:19.060]  How does it affect you and me and our families?
[3:39:19.060 --> 3:39:23.300]  How is it going to play out for our great, great grandchildren who we have not met yet?
[3:39:23.300 --> 3:39:28.020]  Because whatever we do now is going to matter to them and none of us hate them, whether
[3:39:28.020 --> 3:39:30.820]  you're left, whether you're right, whether you're in the middle, none of us hate our
[3:39:30.820 --> 3:39:31.820]  great, great grandchildren.
[3:39:31.820 --> 3:39:36.820]  We don't even know them yet, but we need to build a different reset than the one the
[3:39:36.820 --> 3:39:43.820]  globalists have in mind because the reset is coming soon, sooner than we think.
[3:39:43.820 --> 3:39:47.620]  The first stage has been underway the last four years.
[3:39:47.620 --> 3:39:58.020]  I hope that this president, whoever it is, and I believe it will be Trump again, does
[3:39:58.020 --> 3:40:00.540]  finish the job.
[3:40:00.540 --> 3:40:05.460]  We need an international and more importantly, a national whistleblower program.
[3:40:05.460 --> 3:40:10.420]  We need to bring the whistleblowers back to the United States and pardon them.
[3:40:10.420 --> 3:40:16.700]  Then we need to talk to them about maybe they ought to be, maybe Snowden should be the general
[3:40:16.700 --> 3:40:19.300]  accounting office for the NSA.
[3:40:19.300 --> 3:40:23.820]  Maybe he should have a role there to see if they're cheating, lying, and stealing, and
[3:40:23.820 --> 3:40:26.580]  trampling over you or not.
[3:40:26.580 --> 3:40:31.340]  These are the kind of people that will buck the system that we need to bring back.
[3:40:31.340 --> 3:40:33.540]  We need to pardon a sage.
[3:40:33.540 --> 3:40:34.540]  He's press.
[3:40:34.540 --> 3:40:36.140]  He's the free press.
[3:40:36.140 --> 3:40:38.820]  We need to free the free press.
[3:40:38.820 --> 3:40:41.860]  He's in jail.
[3:40:41.860 --> 3:40:47.380]  Press that everybody leaned into when they could use his bits of data and they fostered
[3:40:47.380 --> 3:40:50.700]  the international agenda unknowingly to him.
[3:40:50.700 --> 3:40:53.740]  Now he doesn't get to say a word.
[3:40:53.740 --> 3:40:56.540]  His organization is stifled when it should be free.
[3:40:56.540 --> 3:41:00.780]  If you don't like what someone says, change the channel.
[3:41:00.780 --> 3:41:07.060]  But it is an info on steroids right now, ladies and gentlemen, between big interest and for
[3:41:07.060 --> 3:41:15.900]  a few hundred million dollars, half of a B1 bomber, they can corrupt it all, blackmail.
[3:41:15.900 --> 3:41:20.900]  One of the tools for the new world order, ladies and gentlemen, including the government
[3:41:20.900 --> 3:41:25.140]  operating in yours and my name, and this is where Trump needs to get to the bottom of
[3:41:25.140 --> 3:41:26.580]  it.
[3:41:26.580 --> 3:41:28.220]  Clean it out.
[3:41:28.220 --> 3:41:31.540]  These guys have stomped over us for a long time.
[3:41:31.540 --> 3:41:35.580]  Secretary of Energy O'Leary during the Clinton administration said a half a million Americans
[3:41:35.580 --> 3:41:38.060]  were a victim of human experiments.
[3:41:38.060 --> 3:41:42.420]  Everything from injecting them with syphilis to mind control of MKUltra.
[3:41:42.420 --> 3:41:45.140]  What's happened to any of those people?
[3:41:45.140 --> 3:41:49.020]  Half a million victims and nobody's in prison yet.
[3:41:49.020 --> 3:41:52.980]  Well, maybe he's digging out the deep state.
[3:41:52.980 --> 3:41:54.420]  Maybe he's not.
[3:41:54.420 --> 3:41:56.500]  But I hope so.
[3:41:56.500 --> 3:41:57.860]  I do.
[3:41:57.860 --> 3:41:59.380]  Because we're at the threshold.
[3:41:59.380 --> 3:42:03.980]  We're at five minutes to midnight, ladies and gentlemen, and we need our government
[3:42:03.980 --> 3:42:05.500]  back.
[3:42:05.500 --> 3:42:08.180]  We needed back this election cycle.
[3:42:08.180 --> 3:42:14.300]  We don't need a one-party system right now, not at all, because at the national level,
[3:42:14.300 --> 3:42:17.340]  they're both corrupt, the national level political parties.
[3:42:17.340 --> 3:42:21.820]  Now, Trump, he came into the Republican Party and took it over.
[3:42:21.820 --> 3:42:23.940]  He wasn't part of the establishment.
[3:42:23.940 --> 3:42:24.940]  Four years ago.
[3:42:24.940 --> 3:42:28.740]  Remember, they were all free-trading Republicans, sell out America, sell out America.
[3:42:28.740 --> 3:42:31.740]  He came and said, I don't know, we're not doing that.
[3:42:31.740 --> 3:42:37.380]  And he kind of rewrote and re-emphasized the important parts of the Republican platform.
[3:42:37.380 --> 3:42:43.700]  But one of those parts of the conservative platforms, including AIP, I was there, Alaska
[3:42:43.700 --> 3:42:51.620]  Independence Party keynote this last weekend, and this is what we need to remember is all
[3:42:51.620 --> 3:42:55.660]  of our conservative parties talk about parental choice and education, the foundation of our
[3:42:55.660 --> 3:43:01.940]  future, our kids, and our grandkids, and the great grandkids, and great great grandkids
[3:43:01.940 --> 3:43:04.700]  I was talking about a little bit ago.
[3:43:04.700 --> 3:43:07.860]  Now these conservatives say they support parental choice and education.
[3:43:07.860 --> 3:43:08.860]  Where's the legislation?
[3:43:08.860 --> 3:43:09.940]  Where has it been introduced?
[3:43:09.940 --> 3:43:11.460]  What committees has it cleared?
[3:43:11.460 --> 3:43:12.460]  Nope.
[3:43:12.460 --> 3:43:16.460]  They're lying to you through their teeth at the state, national level, and they say,
[3:43:16.460 --> 3:43:19.660]  can produce the legislation and show where it's moving.
[3:43:19.660 --> 3:43:25.500]  Otherwise, it's just, yes, ladies and gentlemen, more fertilizer, they're feeding you.
[3:43:25.500 --> 3:43:28.300]  But it isn't fertilizer at all.
[3:43:28.300 --> 3:43:29.820]  July.
[3:43:29.820 --> 3:43:33.460]  Alaska Independence Party has it in their platform, their pro-family platform.
[3:43:33.460 --> 3:43:39.020]  I helped build that platform in terms of the education component years ago.
[3:43:39.020 --> 3:43:44.340]  And I'm not a part of the party today, I'm a libertarian, I'm about to changed undeclared.
[3:43:44.340 --> 3:43:45.340]  How come?
[3:43:45.340 --> 3:43:48.460]  Because I don't believe in any party that has a national party.
[3:43:48.460 --> 3:43:52.700]  Now I'm thinking about AIP again, because again, I'm thinking local.
[3:43:52.700 --> 3:43:55.100]  The national parties are corrupt.
[3:43:55.100 --> 3:44:00.100]  I said that this convention this last Saturday, I hope they upload that, because it was really
[3:44:00.100 --> 3:44:04.940]  a good presentation about all of what we're talking about today.
[3:44:04.940 --> 3:44:11.100]  And you know, there's bad people on the extreme end of all the political parties that have
[3:44:11.100 --> 3:44:13.180]  a national agenda.
[3:44:13.180 --> 3:44:18.340]  And then there's globalists that have taken over and co-opted much leadership from major
[3:44:18.340 --> 3:44:20.140]  political parties.
[3:44:20.140 --> 3:44:26.180]  And so what you see is co-option and play, because it's cheaper than a war, doesn't
[3:44:26.180 --> 3:44:33.460]  cost a trillion, might cost a billion, a thousand times less to take a government.
[3:44:33.460 --> 3:44:34.460]  And we're seeing it.
[3:44:34.460 --> 3:44:38.700]  Epstein stuff, when are we going to see what's on all those tapes and who are all these players?
[3:44:38.700 --> 3:44:42.700]  Now they got them in the Virgin Islands, somebody did, somebody collected them in New York,
[3:44:42.700 --> 3:44:44.780]  where are they now?
[3:44:44.780 --> 3:44:49.300]  We need disclosure, we need whistleblowers, we need them now more than ever, we need a
[3:44:49.300 --> 3:44:50.380]  truth commission.
[3:44:50.380 --> 3:44:55.940]  We need people to be able to come forward, spill their guts and be forgiven actually,
[3:44:55.940 --> 3:44:59.180]  be forgiven because the truth is worth it.
[3:44:59.180 --> 3:45:03.580]  The only way we'll ever reclaim this country, the only other way we'll reclaim our liberty
[3:45:03.580 --> 3:45:08.380]  no matter what country you're hearing this broadcast in today is to reclaim the truth
[3:45:08.380 --> 3:45:09.900]  with transparency.
[3:45:09.900 --> 3:45:12.620]  We need to look into our governments to see the truth.
[3:45:12.620 --> 3:45:17.380]  You're in the info wars, you are the tip of the spear and this is Dr. Nick Begge, signing
[3:45:17.380 --> 3:45:19.300]  off this Friday afternoon.
[3:45:19.300 --> 3:45:47.380]  Thanks for being here.
