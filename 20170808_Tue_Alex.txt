[00:01.000 --> 00:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:07.000 --> 00:11.000]  This is a national emergency. Important instructions will follow.
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  What do you want? I just got my phone.
[00:13.000 --> 00:15.000]  Do you have the phone?
[00:15.000 --> 00:17.000]  I don't have my phone.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  Shot fired.
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.000]  This message is transmitted at the request with the president of the United States of America
[00:29.000 --> 00:31.000]  and the Office of Homeland Security.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  In compliance with the United Nations, the president of the United States has declared martial law.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  Curfew is now in place. Return to your homes.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  But it's all over.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  If you want more people outside of your homes, we will result in you being arrested on site.
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  Anyone obsessed with firearms or in the night of war, the instrument can be used as a weapon.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  We'll be seen as an enemy in the state and we'll be arrested on site.
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  UN peacekeeping citizens have suffered all data transmissions and telephone communications for national security.
[01:03.000 --> 01:11.000]  In violation of martial law, rules of immediate arrests and trial for treason, all traitors will be shot.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  America is now engaged in civil war.
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:26.000 --> 01:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, words cannot describe the incredible times that we're all living in right now.
[01:36.000 --> 01:50.000]  And now, all over mainstream news, all over the halls of government and major universities, inside our religious centers,
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  the open discussion is here.
[01:53.000 --> 02:06.000]  Like so many times in history, you drift into war, you drift into enslavement, you drift into civil unrest.
[02:06.000 --> 02:19.000]  And we are now drifting deeper and deeper and deeper into a situation that if the powder keg touches off,
[02:19.000 --> 02:31.000]  it will make the five years of martial law, murder, carnage, starvation, death look tame in Venezuela.
[02:31.000 --> 02:41.000]  The corrupt political class in this country has decided to go authoritarian and has decided to completely abridge and demolish
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  what's left of our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:46.000 --> 02:54.000]  They have weaponized the colleges, they have weaponized the primary schools, they have weaponized the TV, the media.
[02:54.000 --> 03:06.000]  They are creating mass mental illness, total division and openly waging war against President Trump and patriots in the government.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  Attempt to turn the economy back on.
[03:12.000 --> 03:23.000]  Pat Buchanan has a powerful article that's linked up on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, drugreport.com.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  After the coup, what then?
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  And it breaks down the fact that there is an ongoing admitted coup.
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  And they're saying they're involved in a coup.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  It's a high-tech 21st century coup.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  And the exact same type of coup is going on against Benjamin Netanyahu.
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  Whether you love him or you hate him, it's the same globalist interest.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  George Soros, the Vatican, the globalists who are openly directing it.
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  And that's in mainstream news, Jerusalem Post, Reuters.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  That Netanyahu has been declared an enemy of the Israel state.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  They've got his emails where he's trying to overthrow it and he's trying to overthrow the United States and Europe.
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  And because Muslims are 1.5 billion, in 10 years there'll be 3 billion.
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  They're growing exponentially. The deal's been made.
[04:20.000 --> 04:30.000]  So all you Israel haters, you bought into mainly a bunch of globalist Soros left-wing garbage that's super popular with all the SJWs.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  They all hate Israel.
[04:33.000 --> 04:40.000]  Linda Soros serves their religious leader and then you got all the white supremacists and Nazis running around hating Benjamin Netanyahu too.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  You don't know the facts, the players, you don't know anything.
[04:44.000 --> 04:51.000]  I've told you a thousand times the whole situation with Israel is very fluid with different players just like us.
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  And now we're going to give you the exclusive, the exclusive on who McMaster's working for
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  and the espionage he's been involved in to a corporate multinational power.
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.000]  Roger Stowe's going to give you the biggest story he's ever broken.
[05:07.000 --> 05:14.000]  Why is the fungus? Why is the mold? Why is the yeast taking over? What is going on? What has changed?
[05:14.000 --> 05:22.000]  Dr. Group, the new product, Myco ZX, supports normal fungal and yeast balance proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes, made with high quality ingredients.
[05:22.000 --> 05:29.000]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  It's available at mforwardstore.com. We also have free shipping, orders $50 or more and 10% off.
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  We sign up for auto-ship additionally on top of that. Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  I want to get your reviews. I want to hear what you have to say. For me, it's been incredible.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  Myco ZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast, get it today.
[05:48.000 --> 05:55.000]  Limit it around. It'll be months until we get more. mforwardstore.com and forwardslife.com are triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[05:55.000 --> 06:01.000]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody and you can't support an organization that didn't fight in order.
[06:01.000 --> 06:07.000]  Look at the response we're getting. Whoever changed the world together, you are the mforward. God bless you all.
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[06:12.000 --> 06:20.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[06:20.000 --> 06:25.000]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[06:32.000 --> 06:43.000]  So I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.000]  and supercharging the body at the same time. Info Wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[06:48.000 --> 06:56.000]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[06:56.000 --> 07:04.000]  So Caveman is finally back at the Info Wars store. You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  or by calling toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  A new shipment of Biotrusillinium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.000]  We've been sold out for months. Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife Biotrusillinium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.000]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium,
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  but Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight,
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  Biotrusillinium is also the perfect supercharger to survive a shield X2 nascent iodine
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of Biotrusillinium before we sell it again.
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360WIN.
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight. This is the time to support InfoWars.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[08:07.000 --> 08:19.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[08:19.000 --> 08:24.000]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commentaries.
[08:24.000 --> 08:30.000]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.000]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  It is a big idea, a new order.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  It was almost as if we were planned in force. It's just pancake.
[08:48.000 --> 09:07.000]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[09:07.000 --> 09:21.000]  I also believe that a lot of governments would agree that the A.J.47 is the law in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  For many of us, police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in America.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  This is global governance at last. Is it one world? The central bank is in charge.
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  1776 will commence again. If you're proud to take our firearms, do you understand?
[09:40.000 --> 09:47.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide. This is the main transmission.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  Weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. Infowars live. Yours truly, Alex Jones.
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  It is 8.8. The 8th day of August 2017.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  And all over MSM, they're saying, yes, there's a coup. Yes, we're going to remove Trump.
[10:13.000 --> 10:26.000]  Yes, we've got 90-plus percent of the registered voters. That means people on the jury rolls in the District of Criminals in Swamp Central.
[10:26.000 --> 10:36.000]  In the Swamp Command Base, we have a grand jury in panel sending out the subpoenas to Trump and his family and his associates.
[10:36.000 --> 10:47.000]  And the Deputy Attorney General says, oh, the special prosecutor in the grand jury can look at everything non-Russia-related if we find a bounce check.
[10:47.000 --> 10:58.000]  We're going to say the President's indicted and then use that, even though he is under the separation of powers to stop witch hunts under the Constitution protected.
[10:58.000 --> 11:08.000]  They can't convict him. They'll use that to beat him over the head, just like they're doing with Benjamin yet in Yahoo right now, who says he will not be toppled.
[11:08.000 --> 11:19.000]  And say what you want about Benjamin yet in Yahoo. The facts are there's been a decades-long leftist Soros campaign to demonize Benjamin yet in Yahoo.
[11:19.000 --> 11:33.000]  And now the very leftist groups funded by George Soros are openly trying to topple him with another corruption case started out as, again, an investigation into foreign governments buying him off.
[11:33.000 --> 11:40.000]  And of course, they didn't find that. So what did you say? What you want about Israel? It's certainly not selling out to other governments.
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  It's the other way around many times. Israel does look out for its interest and does burrow into U.S. interest, certainly, and it's very irritating.
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  But that's what governments do if they're sticking up for their country. But what did they find?
[11:54.000 --> 12:06.000]  Oh, somebody might have given him a gift 10 years ago of a piece of pottery or somebody gave him tickets to a show. I mean, it's ridiculous.
[12:06.000 --> 12:16.000]  And it's the same thing with Trump now. They're looking to indict his wife for using public funds for personal expenses.
[12:16.000 --> 12:28.000]  Yes, she might have paid a phone bill. Dun, dun, dun. I mean, if Netanyahu did something, I'd say throw him in prison. I don't care. I'm not a lacudnik.
[12:28.000 --> 12:37.000]  I just study facts. And the very same global interests that are trying to bring down Trump are trying to bring down Netanyahu.
[12:37.000 --> 12:47.000]  And what is Trump doing? $4 trillion in the stock market, $400 billion in new jobs, over a million new jobs, over a thousand companies back,
[12:47.000 --> 12:54.000]  69 percent down any legals coming across, a good Supreme Court justice appointed. Should I keep going here?
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  Killing all these regulations, the economy roaring back, the Dow closes at a record high for the ninth straight time.
[13:00.000 --> 13:11.000]  In FullWars.com, Michael Snyder, optimism of small business owners at highest level seen in a decade.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's put out by the federal government itself. But it doesn't matter.
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.000]  Here's the Pat Buchanan story up on drudgerport.com. After the coup, what then?
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  And Buchanan goes over it. Meanwhile, MSNBC puts out a new fake news headline.
[13:30.000 --> 13:38.000]  Trump should be on 24-hour suicide watch. Fake media pushes Pence betrayal angle to sow more chaos.
[13:38.000 --> 13:49.000]  Nope. Pence is doing his job for the Republican National Committee, raising seven times any previous record in the first six and a half months.
[13:49.000 --> 13:59.000]  Now, let's be honest, as the party positioning Pence, in case they bring down Trump, as parts of the party are, yes, is Pence, I think, actively part of that.
[13:59.000 --> 14:07.000]  No, but we have to be pragmatists and understand. Trump's already had devastating victories against globalism and his political correctness.
[14:07.000 --> 14:14.000]  We've set them back decades, killing their carbon taxes. It goes on and on.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  But this is a war. It's been going on since the beginning of time between good and evil.
[14:19.000 --> 14:27.000]  And you've got to say, get behind me, Satan. That's not just a saying. It's a metaphor. It's a coordinate.
[14:27.000 --> 14:35.000]  The High Women's Superhit. Silver Stallion. Great poetry.
[14:35.000 --> 14:44.000]  Riding like the one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil close behind. One-eyed jack of diamonds is like Odin. One eye on this plane.
[14:44.000 --> 14:51.000]  One eye at God. One eye into the mist.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  Into the land of the gods.
[14:54.000 --> 15:03.000]  Riding forward, trailblazing with the devil close behind. That's even in the Germanic literature. It's in all the archetypes.
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  It's in the Norse archetypes.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.000]  If you guys pull up Silver Stallion live version, the one that I have in there, because I mean, it just says it all.
[15:13.000 --> 15:22.000]  He's riding like the one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil close behind. He's not one-eyed. He's got one eye on Earth, one eye into Heaven.
[15:22.000 --> 15:29.000]  He's already not of the Earth completely. He's already transcended his body.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  The one-eyed man in the land of the blind is king.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  And if Trump's anything, he's a one-eyed man.
[15:37.000 --> 15:45.000]  And they'll go, oh, Illuminati Symbol isn't the Illuminati. Steals all the archetypes, all the images, and then expropriates them for them.
[15:45.000 --> 15:54.000]  They say, Alex, don't use images of rising suns for a new day on your website. That's a cultic. Dave's stolen every symbol. We're taking them back.
[15:54.000 --> 16:03.000]  If any symbol is truly satanic, it's the pentagram, because it's a symbol of a man, a human, that had the arms, the legs, inverted.
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  This is the true esoteric knowledge they don't want you to have.
[16:08.000 --> 16:18.000]  Now, let's expand on this. We have joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour, Roger Stone, with the biggest news yet that he's broken here.
[16:18.000 --> 16:25.000]  You even saw Fox News on Sunday say, we've got to stop those memos with Alex Jones' information getting the president.
[16:25.000 --> 16:34.000]  Now, they know specifically, so we can tell you now, because it's even on Fox News, it's the dreaded Alex Jones-Roger Stone memo.
[16:34.000 --> 16:41.000]  Believe me, at the highest levels of government, they've known about them for about a year, because Stone was doing the memos before for decades,
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  and then you know who gets stuff in the memos. They don't like it.
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.000]  So, I'm going to leave it right there. But they're angry, and they know what's going on.
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  And so, we can get into more of this now, because we now clearly know they know.
[16:56.000 --> 17:07.000]  And it's incredible. The president says, send me the info here. They diverted phone calls. They diverted our phone calls.
[17:07.000 --> 17:15.000]  So, this is real cloak and dagger stuff. I haven't talked about this last four or five months, because it's not about bragging. It's about saving the country.
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  It's just that the president's real, but he's completely surrounded in a swamp, and they're coming after him, ladies and gentlemen.
[17:20.000 --> 17:28.000]  And we're going to give you the biggest news ever about who exactly McMaster's working for, what he's doing, and it's a form of espionage.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  We always think of espionage as doing it to a foreign government.
[17:31.000 --> 17:44.000]  But multinational corporations and combines, and people that are based in reality, that didn't have characters based on them, like Spectre,
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.000]  and the last James Bond movie, the Quantum Group, and it's a guy that plays companies off against each other.
[17:49.000 --> 17:55.000]  He's one of the richest guys in the world, and he's a war criminal. They admit it's, MI6 helped write the script.
[17:55.000 --> 18:02.000]  It's based on George Soros, who tried to crash the British pound, and almost did. Israel has come out in Reuters and said,
[18:02.000 --> 18:09.000]  he is an enemy of Israel and trying to overthrow them. They have the documents. I kept saying, why doesn't Israel come out against Soros?
[18:09.000 --> 18:18.000]  We've got thousands of pages where he's trying to overthrow Israel, and Israel responded and said, oh, we are going to.
[18:18.000 --> 18:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump is trying to restore the Republic. Trump's trying to make peace with everybody.
[18:25.000 --> 18:31.000]  He's trying to be a pragmatist. He's trying to be fair. He's doing default things that are good, that are wholesome, and the enemy is trying to destroy him.
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  He has delivered incredibly, and shame on anybody that buys into the hoax that his polls are down.
[18:36.000 --> 18:42.000]  And shame on anybody that buys into this whole thing that he's been defeated and that he hadn't delivered.
[18:42.000 --> 18:50.000]  He's delivered like nobody in modern history on his promises, and then they leak his phone calls to the Mexican president and people to embarrass him.
[18:50.000 --> 18:57.000]  And it's him on the phone saying, listen, we're going to have sanctions. We send you 10 times the money that you send us.
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.000]  You're going to pay for the wall. You got a wall. All you send up here is a bunch of criminals.
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.000]  And it's bankrupt in our country and driving down wages and not even helping you. Stop criticizing me.
[19:07.000 --> 19:14.000]  They call that weakness that he's doing exactly what he says behind the scenes that he says on television.
[19:14.000 --> 19:20.000]  You know how much easier it is to just say what you say in the open and what you say in private?
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  What you see is what you get.
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  And they run him down for defending America to the Chinese.
[19:29.000 --> 19:40.000]  The phone calls they've released and to Italy and Russia and to Australia that he's actually in there pleading with him, talking to him, being real.
[19:40.000 --> 19:48.000]  And they go, look at Trump say this, look at Trump say that because he's real.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  And they don't know what to do. And so they're getting ready to kill him.
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.000]  And then what are they going to do after they've done that? You think with this insurrection against them, this awakening, they're just going to go away?
[19:58.000 --> 20:05.000]  Once they engage in that criminal activity, they're going to come after everybody and that's going to kick off the real deal.
[20:05.000 --> 20:29.000]  And then they better watch it. We'll be right back.

[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.
[24:01.000 --> 24:05.000]  No tax or my website, danpilla.com
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  If not a markup on a silky high
[24:38.000 --> 24:45.000]  A teacher, he can trust me like a brother
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  One day we'll saddle up and ride
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  And we're gonna ride
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.000]  And we're gonna ride
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  Riding like the one-eyed jack of diamonds
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  The devil's close behind
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  We're gonna ride
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  One-eyed jack of diamonds with a devil close behind
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  That's what it always looks like when there's renewal
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  As we get a beachhead, things turn around, prosperity starts coming back
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  The enemy then throws everything they've got
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  And sometimes the restoration fails
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  And then a great dark age comes upon the land
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  But then it will grow strong in the people's heart to resist yet again
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  That's why they've never defeated humanity. The globalists have never been successful long term
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  That's why they're seeking to end the human species, end men and women, end families
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  First they got us where we didn't go out and cook outside at night and talked to our neighbors
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  And look at the stars and tell stories
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  They got us to stop hunting and fishing. They got us to stop farming
[25:54.000 --> 26:01.000]  They got us to move into the big mega cities and turn their artificial television world into our reality
[26:01.000 --> 26:07.000]  And at first messages were things that we were accustomed to
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  Father knew best
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  But fast forward 70 years we're told fathers can't even exist
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  It isn't misguided liberal loony tune visions that we're under
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  It's absolutely scientific AI exterminism
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  That's why of course there's real racism by whites against other people
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000]  Of course there's other real crimes and other real issues and other real systems
[26:34.000 --> 26:42.000]  But all of it is nothing compared to the globalist and it's world exterminist, anti-human, transhumanist program
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  All of it is manipulated and is only secondary to the larger compendium of the false reality
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.000]  Reality they're building which is already partially constructed and wreaking devastating havoc
[26:57.000 --> 27:06.000]  Their job is to take everything we do trying to bring back common sense in a pro-human system
[27:06.000 --> 27:20.000]  Pro sovereignty, pro family, pro barriers in our own lives, our own privacy, our own country, our own system
[27:20.000 --> 27:28.000]  We are tolerant in the West but we are not open to be colonized and programmed by whatever the globalist cook up
[27:28.000 --> 27:37.000]  And so everything we do to try to stabilize things from the destabilization to then try to rebuild and have a real discussion
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  And educate the public about how scientific social engineering has been used against them
[27:42.000 --> 27:50.000]  The enemy just throws more chaos, more fog of war, more smoke in to confound those that are not aware
[27:50.000 --> 28:01.000]  And those who bought into this delusion they've already invested so much in it that even the smarter minions of the system don't want to pull out of it
[28:01.000 --> 28:08.000]  Because they'll have to admit they've been conned just like everybody knows people that have done the Nigerian email scams
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  And then those people get mad at you when they get ripped off and never talk to you again
[28:12.000 --> 28:20.000]  They don't thank you for trying to warn them in my whole life when I've warned people
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  And it turns out to be right, they hate me for it
[28:24.000 --> 28:31.000]  I almost don't know one that's ever thanked me other than our audience, it's a big enough pool of people where I guess that's what this audience is
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.000]  It's just normal, common sense folks, I want to thank everybody that taught me right
[28:36.000 --> 28:42.000]  Even though I thought they were wrong at the time and I guess that's a sign of immaturity when you're a snot-nosed teenager
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  Don't appreciate people that give you advice on things they've already experienced
[28:45.000 --> 28:54.000]  You take it as an insult, but later you find out how right they were and so many times they're already dead and gone and you can't thank them can you?
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.000]  That's what tears my guts out, I know what powers Trump, I know he is the real deal
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  He is very fatalistic, he is committed and he just says, I'm doing it this way, I'm not backing down
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.000]  I'm not giving in, I'm not compromising and they can just do whatever they want
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  I'm going to fight as hard as I can and he doesn't feel sorry for himself and he's not demoralized
[29:12.000 --> 29:17.000]  The enemy tells you that because they want to demoralize everybody else
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  And this fight is so intense right now for the soul of the people
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.000]  Look at these articles, I'm going to come back with the big news with Roger Stone
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.000]  Voters to Trump, they keep having all these fake CNN polls
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  You know like the ones during the campaign and the WikiLeaks how they were faking them
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.000]  But the same known liars have creeped back again with a whole flotella of fake stuff
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.000]  Voters, polls show they don't trust him in North Korea
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  Polls show they don't like the economy Trump's done
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  Polls show the economy's not really that good
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  Polls show he's lost all his support
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.000]  Well now they keep saying never tweet, never tweet, never tweet, never tweet, never tweet
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  Yes, cut off your communication, don't challenge us
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.000]  Let us destroy you
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  Put down your arms
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  You're like saving Private Ryan
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  Oh, let's stop fighting, oh yes, give me the upper hand
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.000]  Why is the fungus, why is the mold, why is the yeast taking over
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  What is going on, what has changed
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  Dr. Group, the new product, Myco ZX
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  Supports normal fungal and yeast balance
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  Preparatory blend of herbs and enzymes
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  Made with high quality ingredients
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  And I've been testing this formula
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  And making changes to this formula for over 10 years
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.000]  It's available at mforwardstore.com
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  We also have free shipping, orders $50 or more
[30:34.000 --> 30:37.000]  And 10% off, we sign up for auto-ship additionally on top of that
[30:37.000 --> 30:40.000]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  For me, it's been incredible
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  Myco ZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  Get it today, limit it around, it'll be months
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  We'll get more
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  mforwardstore.com and forwardslife.com
[30:53.000 --> 30:56.000]  Our AAA-253-339
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.000]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  And you can't support an organization that didn't fight in order
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.000]  Look at the response we're getting
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  Whoever changed the world together
[31:05.000 --> 31:34.000]  You are the Info War, God bless you all
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.000]  To the best job you can to purify your air
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  While themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  Or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  The general public doesn't
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  Replacing older, more expensive filters
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  That didn't do as good a job
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  At mforwardstore.com
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  Today I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  Of DNA Forces finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  Who've signed up for Auto Ship to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.000]  And we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game changer
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  Like DNA Force, we never know
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  When we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients
[32:30.000 --> 32:33.000]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  Of patented ingredients like CoQ10
[32:35.000 --> 32:38.000]  Systematic enzymes, NAR-lipolic acid
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  BioPQQ and many others
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.000]  Visit mforwardstore.com and read the reviews for yourself
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of
[32:54.000 --> 32:59.000]  4.8 out of 5 stars through our third party certified review agency Power Review
[32:59.000 --> 33:01.000]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment
[33:01.000 --> 33:05.000]  And get DNA Force today at mforwardstore.com before it sells out again
[33:05.000 --> 33:08.000]  That's mforwardstore.com
[33:23.000 --> 33:27.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  You gotta hand it to Drudge
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.000]  Every day he uses that site, the most dominant new site in the world
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  Number 3 website total on the planet
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  As a palette to illustrate where we are
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  The site is stark black and white today
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  Netanyahu, I won't be toppled as one headline
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  North Korea missiles ready
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.000]  North Korea prepares nuclear weapon as they threaten the United States
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  North Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  That can fit inside its missiles
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  Crossing a key threshold on the path to becoming a full fledged nuclear power
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.000]  U.S. intelligence officials have concluded in a confidential assessment
[34:14.000 --> 34:24.000]  Yes, and now they can hit basically as far east of the United States as Chicago
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  And another psychotic, inbred royal
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  Calling himself a communist as usual
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  Is threatening to attack the United States
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  And leftist media is blaming Trump
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  When this has been brewing for decades
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  And the Clintons gave them the reactors
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  And gave them the missile technology
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  That was all over the news
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  That's even New York Times admits that
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  But that's okay
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  We've got a grand jury in panel where 93% of the voters voted Democrat
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  In the District of Swamps, in the District of Criminals
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  In the District of Columbia
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  By Mueller, where his law firm and the groupies assembled
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  Gave 99.8% of their money to Hillary
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  Completely should recuse themselves
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  Total conflict of interest
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  The only worst conflict of interest would be Adolf Hitler being the head judge
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  At Nuremberg over the Nazis
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  Or let's say if you were a judge and you were divorcing your wife
[35:17.000 --> 35:18.000]  Or vice versa
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  Or your wife was a judge in your family court
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  She sat as the judge in your family hearing
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  In your family court case
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  I mean, it's that cut and dry, that ridiculous
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  Pat Buchanan writes the coup is happening
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.000]  What happens after the coup?
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  At the start of the next hour
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  I'm going to get deep into this North Korea situation and more
[35:44.000 --> 35:51.000]  But let's get into the big news right now
[35:51.000 --> 35:59.000]  Roger Stone has a lot of really great sources
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  And he doesn't like to play up his sources obviously
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  Because then they try to block his access to those sources
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  But they know the statements we've seen on Meet the Press
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  And Fox News Sunday and other places
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  They know exactly what's going on
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  So I think at this point
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  Roger can say as much as he'd like
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  But I think they know the cards, we know the cards
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  I think the public needs to know the cards
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  To understand just how dire the situation is
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  Now, good things are happening with the economy
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  Good things are happening with Supreme Court
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  And federal judges and the boarders
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  Best of times, worst of times, tail of two cities
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  But they're trying to cut the president off
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  They're saying everywhere, stop tweeting, stop tweeting
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  They want to cut his information off
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  They've got Kelly reportedly trying to cut the information off
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  The leakers
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.000]  But we have giant news concerning McMaster
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  That is high level and that we can also substantiate
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  From Reuters and Associated Press
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  And other reports that have already come out
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  But this shows us that McMaster's not just on a think tank
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  With George Soros funding and he's not just bringing in
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  A bunch of former top George Soros people
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  That headed up his foundations
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  But that he is being monitored by multiple intelligence
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  Agencies and is an actual operative
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  Fully taking orders and giving briefings
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  And under the command
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.000]  This is exclusive of the gentlemen
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  That the state of Israel has now declared an enemy
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  Of their state and who is openly trying to overthrow
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  The Israeli government and in the WikiLeaks
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  Turn them over to the Muslims
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  New York Times, Israel's war against George Soros
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  Aw evil Israel, poor sweet little Nazi collaborator
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  George Soros, you cannot make this up
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  Israel backs Hungary says
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  Financers Soros is a threat
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  Bombshell, Soros and Sider infiltrate Trump administration
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  That was us on May 31st
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.000]  We now have the direct intel
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  That McMaster is a foreign intelligence agent
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  That's what this is, but we think of it as governments
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  What about multinational combines
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  That fictional groups like Specter and Chaos
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  And things are modeled after
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  And that's admittedly what George Soros does
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  So you're about to get the huge breaking news exclusively
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  Right now that has been double checked
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  By Stone with his sources
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  You've got Fox News saying we've got to stop
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  His memos getting to the president
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  That's the big secret
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  They've got to stop my information in those memos
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  Getting to the president
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  I don't know how much Stone can say, but this is huge
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  Roger Stone, thank you for joining us
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  I know you've just rushed back to D.C. this morning
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  You just got there, you're leaving your hotel
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  To have key meetings right after this interview
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  You just checked in, so I know you've got to hurry
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  Please give us your info and again, watch your back
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  Thank you very much, Alex
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  It's interesting that yesterday the attorney Larry Klayman
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  Predicted that I would be targeted for annihilation
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  As part of the Trump takedown
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  I am not afraid
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  I'm actually here to meet with other Trump boilists
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  In a new group that we have founded
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  The membership of which is secret
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  But we call it the 45 group
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  Because we're prepared to protect and defend
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  Our 45th president
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  We have learned definitively that
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  Israeli intelligence has intercepted communications
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  From General McMaster to George Soros
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.000]  Reporting on a regular basis on the reorganization
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  Of the White House and what is going on inside
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  The Oval Office
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  I have double checked this with two different sources
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  Very high up in Israeli intelligence
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  I actually expect the ambassador to Israel
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  From Israel to the United States
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.000]  May be confirming this for news organizations this afternoon
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  This is not surprising because as you know Alex
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  You first reported here
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  That a woman named Fiona Hill
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  Who actually once worked for Soros
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  And the open society operation
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  Had been brought into the White House by McMasters
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  Specifically to handle
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  She was a director of large operations
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  Which interface with other foreign governments
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  And intelligence agencies
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  So this is the big multinational breakaway group
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.000]  His open society group
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  Where they recruit people out of other intelligence agencies
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  Into this multinational group to engage in treason
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  And this one I think is not easy to explain
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  Under what circumstances in what universe
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  Would Donald Trump's national security advisor
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  Be briefing George Soros
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  A sworn enemy of the Trump administration
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  A globalist who has demonstrated again and again
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  That he's prepared to break the law
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  And utilize violence to try to achieve his goals
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  And why not? He never gets in trouble
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  Not when he was selling out his fellow Jews
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  And helping round them up
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  Not when he overthrew all these governments
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  Not when he funded the Arab Spring
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  He's had a vampiric life of delightful carnage
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  So the McMaster problem is a real one
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  I do want to make one correction
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  I said inadvertently yesterday in our report
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  That it was Steve Bannon who called Matt Brudge
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  And asked him not to run the McMaster stories
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  Regarding Susan Rice
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  I misspoke that was incorrect
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  It was Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.000]  Who asked Brudge not to run the McMaster stories
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  I can also tell you that while Sean Spicer
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  And Ryan Spribus had worked very hard
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  To make sure that the presidential news summary
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  Did not include anything published or put forward
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  By the Daily Caller, right far
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  Infowars.com, Town Hall
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  And a number of other excellent alternative sites
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  By the way, we reported this weeks ago
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  It's not confirmed, there's a blacklist
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  Of Trump's hardline supporters
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  That are Americana, that are tried and true
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  And that are exposing McMaster purging
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  Anybody exposing the fact that he's in bed with Soros
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  And Islamists
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  Well, and again, this headline is a perfect example
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  It's a misnomer
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  In order to secure a statement from the president
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  Supporting McMaster
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  They essentially dissembled saying
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  Some people, not conservatives, not Trump supporters
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  Some people are attacking McMaster
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  Because he's not sufficiently pro-Israel, Mr. President
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  So would you put out a statement saying
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  He's a friend of Israel, and of course the president complied
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  Now that gets used as a blanket endorsement
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  Of McMaster's activities
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  But I can tell you for an absolute fact
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  That the president was not briefed on the fact
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  That McMaster gave Susan Rice a pass
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  Said there was nothing wrong with her
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  Engaging in political espionage
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  And that he extended her security
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  International security clearance
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  The president was not told these things
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  Within the context of the attack on McMaster
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  So he is being manipulated
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  Let me tell you something
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  He hates being manipulated
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  They're not going to be successful
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  In cutting him out
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  They're not going to be successful in isolating him
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  Because he will break out
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  He will call old Fred
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  He will call key supporters
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  He will call those he knows were with him
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  From the beginning
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  And the first time the president learns something
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  That he should have been told by his handlers
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  But he wasn't
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  There will be hell to pay
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.000]  I've noticed that pattern
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  That when he's given good info
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  But learns that it was blocked from him
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  He particularly acts on the info
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  They've tried to keep from him
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  Especially when it's from tried and true sources
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  That continue to have the real sixth sense
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  Of what's going on
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  Let's play a clip of Fox Sunday
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  With this reporter on there
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  This Charles Hurt
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  Bemoaning the fact that will they be successful
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  In isolating the president
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.000]  Here it is
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  McMaster has I believe three stars on his shoulder
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  But his military bearing hasn't protected him
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  From a campaign of vicious leaks
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  Coming from people within the White House
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  Who regard him as sort of a sell out
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  On foreign policy
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  Kelly has to get that's
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  He's got his hands on that problem right now
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  And I think a lot of people inside the staff
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  Are looking to see if he can really get control of it
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  Because if he can, well
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  Then I think he'll have established his authority
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  And people will do what he says
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  But if somehow people find ways to work around
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.000]  Even John Kelly
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  If the back channeling directly to the president
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  And sending him memos
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  That reflect the latest Alex Jones
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  Conspiracy theory continues
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  Then I think Kelly still has a problem on his hand
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  You know, and so
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  Roger, I want to get back to Soros
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  Because it's proven that McMaster is in bed
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  With the groups that are working for the open society
[45:21.000 --> 45:22.000]  The world government
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  And that Soros is kind of the cut out
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  That multinationals use to carry this out
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  But specifically
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  You've not wanted to build up your contact
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  And neither have I
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  And the memos and the rest of it
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  Not just from this guy
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  I mean, they know what's going on
[45:37.000 --> 45:38.000]  And I don't know how much we can share
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  How much we can get into
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.000]  You know, dealing with all this
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  But people just need to understand
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  We continue to break huge news
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  Like Prima's going to be fired by the weekend
[45:47.000 --> 45:48.000]  And who is going to replace him
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  Because we do have the highest level sources
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  And it's not just about us having sources
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  It's that they really are on Capitol Hill
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  Trying to sell the idea of overthrowing the president
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  Drugging him, saying he collapsed
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  Killing him, they're looking at seizing the media
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  They're looking at shutting off Sean Hannity
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  As soon as this happens
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  Rush Limbaugh, Matt Drudge
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  I mean, there's no selling out to this
[46:09.000 --> 46:10.000]  They're not giving us quarter
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  And they're going to come after our jobs
[46:12.000 --> 46:13.000]  The economy
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  These are horrible people
[46:14.000 --> 46:15.000]  This is a multinational group
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  That wants to bankrupt the country
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  To buy it up for pennies on the dollar
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  We're under total war attack
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  And we need to see the president
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  Move very strongly
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  Against this outside multinational threat
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  And I get it's outrageous
[46:28.000 --> 46:29.000]  We've got a double agent
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  Like McMaster clearly in there
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  But, you know, you're talking to the highest levels
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  Confirming they're monitoring people's communications
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.000]  Other governments are
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  And to the foreign governments, you know, are
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  Here's McMaster with briefings
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  And taking orders
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  I mean, just like General Jones
[46:44.000 --> 46:45.000]  Who's not a bad guy in some ways
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  But, you know, did say I get my orders, you know
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  Every day from Henry Kissinger
[46:49.000 --> 46:50.000]  That was treasonous
[46:50.000 --> 46:51.000]  But this isn't Kissinger
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  At least he's in a media
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  What we're dealing with here is
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  Is just unbelievable garbage
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  And so out of one side of the mountain
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  They're pushing coup violence
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.000]  Authoritarian takeover
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  But so we can't organize it against it
[47:04.000 --> 47:05.000]  They go, oh look, Jones is crazy
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.000]  He just made it up
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  And said gay frogs are going to have a coup
[47:08.000 --> 47:09.000]  Or something
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  So we're just in an incredible moment
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  Historically, Roger
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  Well, let's look across
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  The horizon
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  Limbaugh
[47:19.000 --> 47:20.000]  Kennedy
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.000]  Levin
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  All reporting that there's a slow motion
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  Coup in place
[47:25.000 --> 47:26.000]  They all get it
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  They're right on the money
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  This is an effort to co-op
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  Donald Trump
[47:31.000 --> 47:34.000]  If he'll go quietly into his room
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  And they are able to
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  Suspend work on the wall
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  They are able to
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  Submarine his corporate tax cuts
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  They are able to persuade him
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  Not to prosecute the Obama-NSA
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  Frontline for their
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  Regis mass-based spying
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  According to the FISA report
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  They will allow the president to sleep
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  And they will keep him there
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  Until Robert Mueller
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  The appointed Lord High
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  Exitutioner
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  Is prepared to spring his trick
[48:07.000 --> 48:08.000]  On the president
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  This is very reminiscent
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  Of the way
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.000]  General Al Haig
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  Walked Richard Nixon
[48:14.000 --> 48:15.000]  Towards the exit
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  All the time professing
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  His loyalty
[48:18.000 --> 48:19.000]  And the fact that he would fight
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  Better end
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  When, in fact, he already had
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  Nixon's exit carefully planned
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  Was it Haig that was the main deep throat?
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  I believe that that is the case
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  Haig is loyal to his
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  To the Pentagon and the neocons
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  And he realizes that Nixon
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Can not survive
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  And therefore he does a number of things
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  To set Nixon up including
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  The famous 18-and-a-half-minute gap
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  Which was not made by Rosemary Woods
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  Was made by General Haig
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  And Fred Buzzard
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  If you read my book, Nixon's secrets
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  This is, of course, all about the president
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  Of course, you were best friends with Nixon
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  After he was president
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  Now let's expand on all this
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  They're doing the same thing
[49:01.000 --> 49:02.000]  They're telling everybody
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  Go along with this
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  Take care of yourself
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  We're gonna get you
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  We're gonna put you in prison, too
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  And most of these guys are rolling over
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  Like cowards
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  Well, it's not like you're just rolling over
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  To let the Pentagon run things
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  Like 1974
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  This is letting, 1975
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  This is letting globalists come in
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  That want to literally destroy our families
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  Take our guns, wreck the nation
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  And destroy the country
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  I mean, no one can join with this
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  This is insane
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  Everyone must fight against this system
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  I think the president's in a good position
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  If he keeps tweeting
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  He's launched his own network now
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  Starting out with a once-a-week program
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  They're horrified of that
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  They keep saying, oh, CNN polls
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  Say don't tweet
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  Because they want to put their lives out
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  And not have them counter it
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  I think the president's got to go on offense big time
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  What do you think you should do right now
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  And then back into Soros?
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  Well, Alex, I think we're now gonna play
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  This extended cat and mouse game
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  They're gonna try to play keep away
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  With the president of the United States
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  They're going to do a freedom like a mushroom
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  Keep him in the dark and feed him crap
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  Unfortunately, in Donald Trump
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  You have a naturally inquisitive
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  Extraverted guy who likes to talk to people
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  And likes to get the feel for issues
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  He didn't get, for example, the failures
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  In our Veterans Health Care program
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  From some poll or some focus group
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  He got it by talking to veterans
[50:27.000 --> 50:30.000]  And the more he heard, the angrier he got
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  He gets straight from the people
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  He gets sustenance from the people
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  That's why they will not, in the end,
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.000]  Be able to isolate him as hard as they may cry
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  Right now, it's problematic that he's not seeing
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  Bright Park or Daily Poll or Info Wars
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.000]  That these things are not included in his new summary
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  And there's nobody surfing with that
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  And imagine how scary it is for them
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  Because it's confirmed
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  They don't even want him looking at drudge
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  But he knows to go to drudge
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  And so that's why, reportedly, they're trying to even keep
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  Articles off there about what McMaster really did
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  He didn't just say, oh, Susan Rice can keep her clearance
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  So I can talk to her
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  No, he says she's good
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  Unmasking the president's good
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Spying on him when he was a candidate
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  And his family is good
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  The president needs to know that McMaster did that
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  That's the facts
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  Well, and you had a terrific story
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  In the free beacon two days ago
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  It indicated Samantha Power, the U.N. ambassador
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  Was unmasking hundreds of people
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  I want to bet they were all Republicans
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  But based on my information
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  The president has not yet been briefed about this
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  It's not clear that the president
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  Completely understands the scope
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.000]  And depth of the surveillance
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  That was conducted by Obama
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  He put it another way
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  When Donald Trump said he was surveilled
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  At Trump Tower, he was right
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  He was correct
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  And the fight support document
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  Delivered in November moves it
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  And let's expand on this, Roger
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  Those that have talked to the president
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  He is super upbeat
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  Oh, look at the stock market
[52:07.000 --> 52:08.000]  Look at the economy
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  Look, two or three new companies
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  Just came in
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  He sees that as winning
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  That's why they call him crazy
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  He's just a straightforward business guy
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  That believes in free market and two-way streets
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  But then you hear in the news
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  He's depressed, he's this and that
[52:21.000 --> 52:22.000]  From the intel I've got
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  When they convinced him to compromise
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  Like day 75 on a bad health bill
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  He got depressed by that
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  Because he went out on the road
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  And his constituents were generally mad
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  And his poll numbers did actually dip
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  For the only real time
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  So as long as he's being real
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  He's happy, but they're selling this idea
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  That he's downbeat
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  But there's a bad side to that
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  He's so upbeat
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  Focused on getting the economy going
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  And securing the border
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  Which he's done
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  And killing the carbon tax
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  And all the rest of it
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  That I think he's too confident
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  So they're saying he's depressed
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  And unconfident
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  I think from what I've heard
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  He's too confident and too positive
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  Not really underestimating
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  How dangerous these serpents are
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  Well, he's very, very proud
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  Of these recent two rallies
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.000]  He's done one in Ohio, one in Pennsylvania
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  And now more recently in West Virginia
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  Because they confirm what we saw at the campaign
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  The polls are raw
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  People vote with their feet
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.000]  And they show up at his rallies
[53:22.000 --> 53:23.000]  In historic numbers
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  But CNN admits they add 9 to 34 points
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  Against him
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  In every poll
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  They're totally fake
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  And I believe the president
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  Is totally focused on the economy
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  He wants his corporate tax cut
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  He is very disappointed
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  In the congressional Republicans
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  Who have given him lip service
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  But have abandoned him on key votes
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  And now would like to water down
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  His entire economic package
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  In all honesty
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  We reached a point, Alex, where in Washington
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  The House and Senate Republicans
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.000]  Are no longer afraid of Donald Trump
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  They don't think that he will break out of the box
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  And challenge them
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  Which I think may be a miscalculation
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  If you want to get their attention
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  Donald Trump needs to take out
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  A couple Republican incumbents
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  Some of the worst characters out there
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  That's right
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  Watching him raise them record money
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  Breaking, you know, seven times any record
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  When a new incumbent comes in six months in
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  And they sit there bitching and backstabbing
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  And because these old establishment Republicans
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  And by that I mean old thought
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  They love CNN, they love MSNBC
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  They love Fox, which is turning against him
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  And they love being padded on the head by CNN
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  Which had slipped their throat in a second
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  For a stick of bubblegum
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  And they're just so stupid
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  In such archaic anachronisms
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  Who don't even belong to the modern internet age
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  They don't understand
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  If they destroy Trump, as Pat Buchanan says
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  They are going to make him an even bigger martyr
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  The Machiavelli inside of me
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  Kind of hopes they do
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  But then I know they're coming for me next
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.000]  I don't think like that
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.000]  Just like if Hillary would have gone in
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  We'd be making three times the money we ever made
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  You know, I mean, a lot of our things like storeable food
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  95% less sales than we were
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  People should be buying more food now than they used to
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  But you know what, I'm glad Trump's in
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  Because it's the right thing to do
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  I mean, people always sit there and think
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  I think of things like I'm Machiavelli
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  Like what's good for me
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  What's good for me is a good world
[55:23.000 --> 55:24.000]  An honorable world
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  Not a scumbag world
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  Run by witches like Hillary
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  And Kim Jong-Ding Dong Il
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  Sorry
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  Alex, I got to be honest with you
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  Had Hillary Clinton the one
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  I'm not sure they'd be able to find your body
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  Or maybe mine either
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.000]  But in all seriousness, in this case
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  Somebody's got to stand up for the president
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  Somebody's got to keep trying to break through the cocoon
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  President's naturally inquisitive
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  I think the generals have their work
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  That's right, listen, I know you got to go
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  But we got to go to break
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  Do five more than you got to go
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  Because Roger Stone now officially works
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  As a correspondent within Full Wars
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  Coming up next month, he launches his own program
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  Three o'clock central every day
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  For three hours with Mike Cernovich
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  And of course right here in studio
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  Oh, and Shroyer, a lot of stations
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  Stations usually don't pick shows up right away
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  We got him lining up to pick up these broadcasts
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  So excited, we're going to go right back to him
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.000]  Here in just a moment
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  I think that broadcast starts September 4th
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  It was like the 22nd, I believe
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  But I got to do this
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  Because I skip breaks, I do everything else
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  We need your financial support to launch all this
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  I don't want to say, you know, we're fearless
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  We're on kamikaze missions, but we are
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  And we're winning, but we need your prayers
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  We need you to spread the articles and the videos
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  And get around the sensors
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.000]  And we need you to buy the products
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  The children's super blue bubblegum flavor
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  All natural fluoride free iodine
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  Slash, colloidal silver toothpaste is back in
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  That's been sold out for three months
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  My father, he's not retired yet
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  But dentist and oral surgeon designed it
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  It's Dr. Jones approved, new fluoride free
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  With colloidal silver and iodine
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  Super blue mouthwash is here
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  Now, it's still concentrated
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  But not the 10-to-1 like the Emeritus Essentials
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  They're both excellent, but they're apples and oranges
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  We have 50% off out of the gates
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  Because I want you to try these products
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  When you get it in the silver special
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  You get the electric toothbrush, silver impregnated
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  The super blue mouthwash, the colloidal silver
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  The super blue toothpaste
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  And all of it, 50% off
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  Or get it by itself at, what, 11% off
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  It's 1776, part of the 1776 special
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  But whatever you do, support the broadcast
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  Commit to do it today, sign up for auto-ship
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  Get an additional 10% off, cancel anytime
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  It is an act of rebellion to fund us
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  That's why every big show is attacking our funding
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  And trying to take our sponsors and demonizing us
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.000]  Because we're in a war and you see it
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  You understand it, so get Milo's new book, Dangerous
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  Get Ben Garrison's great copy table book
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  With some of his best cartoons
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  Whatever you do, take action
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  The new special is the 1776 special
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  We also have some free shipping on several items
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.000]  Free shipping on everything, $50 or more
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  Triple, eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine
[58:07.000 --> 58:10.000]  Call today, a lot of different specials
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  Specials on water filtration, we're extending the specials
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  On the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  Amazing, at $149 you can't beat it
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  Compro units, $400 to $600
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  Triple, eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine
[58:23.000 --> 58:30.000]  Triple, eight, two, five, three, one, three, nine
[58:30.000 --> 58:33.000]  I want to thank you all for supporting us
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.000]  Breaking through the mind control, breaking the conditioning
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  Understanding we're winning, knowing it's fake polls
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  And seeing the victory as we take America back
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  From the scum and the filth
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  Like Nancy Pelosi and others
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  Second hour straight ahead, more on McMaster
[58:48.000 --> 58:51.000]  Confirmed, giving intelligence briefings
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.000]  To George Soros illegally every day
[58:54.000 --> 58:58.000]  We have identified the agent
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  As most of you already know
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  I am a voracious consumer of news and information
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research
[59:06.000 --> 59:09.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment
[59:09.000 --> 59:13.000]  Is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  In many cases had much better nutrition than we do today
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  Of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth
[59:28.000 --> 59:32.000]  From chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.000]  Known for cleansing and supercharging the body
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.000]  At the same time
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  We're getting results and we're expanding
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  In the face of the complete media assault
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  And winning because of your support
[59:46.000 --> 59:49.000]  Caveman is finally back at the info war store
[59:49.000 --> 59:53.000]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  At infowarslife.com or by calling toll free
[59:55.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Triple A 2533139
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  If you are receiving this transmission
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  You are the resistance
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  It's Alex Jones
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  Roger Stone has impeccable high level forces as you know
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  And he's got breaking exclusive news right now
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  About exactly who McMaster's working for
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  And from my research the intel he's got
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  Shows that what's happening is illegal
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  It's a form of espionage
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  Roger Stone, please break it down for us
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  Alex, I now have confirmed from a source
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Both inside the White House
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  And a source in the Israeli government
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  As well as a source in Israeli intelligence
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  That the Israelis have intercepted
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  Email communications between General McMaster's
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  George Soros informing him of everything
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  That is going on inside the being reorganized White House
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  Further that a woman named Fiona Hill
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  A former Soros staffer has been brought into the White House
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  By McMaster with a specific job
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  Of getting control of Russia policy
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  And defeating any effort towards detente with the Russians
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  Going on a war footing
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  So perhaps we can get World War III
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  McMaster is proving to be the Quizlan
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  I think he is the first among equal in the three
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  General Kabbal
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  That is seeking to grab control of the White House
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  As you know General Mattis is the first military man
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  To be a Secretary of Defense
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  To require a special waiver
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  I think a number of key Trump supporters
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Are beginning to say too many generals
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  Too many generals
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  The other thing I can report is
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  That McMaster has been briefing General Petraeus
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  On a regular basis
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  And Petraeus has, I am told
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  Been briefing the Clintons on the internal operations
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  Of the Trump White House
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  Roger Stone
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  This is what Soros does
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  He's infiltrated scores of governments
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  He's brought down more than a hundred
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  He funded the Arab Spring, the overthrow of the elected Ukrainian government
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  I gotta say it, he's pretty close to Superman
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  When it comes to evil or Lex Luthor
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  He used to write in articles in the 80s
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  He believed he was the Christ, the Messianic leader
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  People can search engine that George Soros worried
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  He'd be thrown into lunatic asylums, what pulls it up
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  But George Soros thought he was the Messiah
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  You'll get mainstream articles
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  And I gotta hand it to him, as for being a Nazi collaborator
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  When he was 14 to 18, rounding up thousands of Jews
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  When he was 14, making them trust him
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  And shipping them off to be killed after robbing him
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  And then right through his life, pure evil
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  He was joining with Islam and flooding Europe
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  He's a false flag factory
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  As Tyler Durgan has written
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  He is amazing, you have to hand it to him
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  Well, on Alex, I'm watching what's going on
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  At the Central Florida Post
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  Central Florida Post is a small, independent, libertarian oriented
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Website, this is an extraordinary investigative reporting
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  And when they learn that George Soros
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Eventually purchased the state's attorney, that's the prosecutor
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  In Seminole County
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  And that she went on an anti-death penalty jihad
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  This was exposed, whereupon the threats of legal action
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  And physical threats against those publishing the Central Florida Post
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  And the immediate reign of fake news, tags
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  And their attacks online are amazing
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  That George Soros' machine and his lackeys
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Would spend this kind of money and effort
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  Trying to kill a fledging libertarian website
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  Put together by a bunch of millennials
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  Really tells you how threatened they are
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  That's right, exactly
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  That's why they're so committed
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  Because they've committed such incredible crimes worldwide
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Their back is now against the wall
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  They're fighting with their lives, they've called it a death battle
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone, look forward to the end
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  Till you get at this key meeting of the new group
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  Stay with us
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  For me, it's Ben Crow
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  MycoZX, Antifungal, Antifungus, Anties
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  Get it today, limited around, it'll be months till we get more
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  InformWorksStore.com, InformWorksLife.com
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  Our AAA-253-33139
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  And you can't support an organization that didn't fight harder
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  Look at the response we're getting
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  Whoever changed the world together
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  You are the InformWork, God bless you all
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  And to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  To create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  Inside the human body
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  And it starts at InformWorksLife.com with Anthroplex
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  While also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  100% organic coffee on the planet
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  For more than a decade
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  Where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  In a highly customized blend
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  100% organic coffee at InformWorksLife.com
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  Without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  And I don't think you're going to be disappointed
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  You will be supporting a free press
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  Available at InformWorksLife.com
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  Waging war on corruption
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  Operation Gremlin is going well
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  As we sabotage global operations
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  And turn the economy back on
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  Our jobs easy with the technology and automation and ingenuity we've got
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  Sky's the limit
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  Disease, poverty, all of it can just be wiped out
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  But that will wipe out all the globalist operations
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  And the fact that they like screwing everybody over
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  And the fact that they like promoting evil
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  And discord and mental illness
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  The gifts of the devil, the curses
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  And so they're trying to block this
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  That's why we're here fighting it
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Again, I am your host Alex Jones
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  InfoWars.com is the hated website by the globalist
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  There's a big story that's been up on DrudgeReport.com
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  Where Sheriff Arpaio, an exclusive interview with InfoWars
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  With Jerome Corsi, Dr. Corsi asked
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  Where is Trump?
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  And it's a window into how Trump has been greatly isolated
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  By Jared Navanca and folks who aren't bad people
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  But being nice to the liberals, appeasing them
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  And kind of a charm offensive from the Murdoch sons
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  You know, behind the scenes cocktail parties
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  That, oh, they just want Trump to see how he's wrong
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  On carbon taxes and wrong on the border
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  And, you know, wrong on sovereignty
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  And then they're gonna be nice
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  But that's not what's happening, ladies and gentlemen
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  Pat Buchanan in another story that's linked up on
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  DrudgeReport.com, it's also on InfoWars.com
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  Everybody should read it, lays out the facts
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  So let's go over some of this
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  And then I'll get into North Korea
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  After the coup, what then?
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  And that's the big question
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  For not just those of us that want to have the American system
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  And believe in free market and believe in free open society
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  And Osoros calls his group up in society
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  That's because it's the opposite
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  It's like the Federal Reserve is not federal
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  Patrick J. Buchanan asked the question
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  That the Trump presidency is bedibbled, is undeniable
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  I don't know if I totally agree with that statement
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  Again, best of times, worst of times, paradoxical
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  It's a paradox, ladies and gentlemen
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  And let's go over that
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  Because they transferred so much power into the executive
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  That isn't supposed to be there
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  And because the executive already does have so much do power
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  He's been able to dismantle
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  Almost half of their operation
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  And you notice it's designed to create
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  The winners and losers, crony capitalist system
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  So just by signaling that we're going to get out of this crony system
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  And get back to a free market system
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  The economy is roaring back
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  But it's been so depressed in many areas
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  That it's obviously not being equally distributed
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  It never is
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  But it's roaring back from the edge of oblivion
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  So they're increasing regulations where they can
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  And he's blocking them in there, raising interest rates
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  And he's trying to get around that
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  And he's killing regulations and all the rest of it
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  So Trump gets, he's in a race
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  If he's going to be successful about the whole
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  Make America a great again agenda
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  And make history like nobody ever has
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  And do the right thing and be a superhero
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  He's got to get that done
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  And we've got to understand what he's up against
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  And what we're up against
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  I mean, we're under attack, but globalists hate us
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  I don't care what color you are, where you came from
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  If you want to be free market
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  If you want to be middle class or wealthy
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  Independent, if you want to be left alone
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  If you want to be free, they don't like you
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  They crave, Bloomberg admits this
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  Total control, he wants to tell you what to eat
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  What to wear and where you live
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  He calls himself the ultimate technocrat
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  And he has Bloomberg write articles about how amazing he is
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  And how he knows how to run your life
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  And his wealth in his last decades
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  Gone from 13 billion to 50 something billion last time I checked
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  Off of high frequency trading and data computers
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  He sold everybody that basically just monkey everything
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  Dude, that's not called, I guess, being a real genius
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  A real genius raises all ships
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  Setting up a scam and getting other scammers going along with you
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Bloomy
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  And then a runner around trying to take our guns away
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  Makes you a schmuck
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Makes you a Bernie Madoff or a Ponzi schemer
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  And you know what you've done
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  So you want to get your slaves disarmed
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  Because you know everything, Bloomberg
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  You're the big man, you're going to show us
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  How we're supposed to live
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Like Schmidt
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  All the other little club of, you know what
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  Begins with A and ends with H
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Two words
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  After the coup, what then?
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  That the Trump presidency is bedeviled
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  Is undeniable
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  And then it goes on from there
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  But is it bedeviled?
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  He's getting one huge part of the agenda done
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  While they encircle him and run around
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  Fitting and screaming and yelling like toddlers
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  Calling for his death, running around
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Saying they control reality, trying to plunge the economy
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  Yes, they've bedeviled themselves
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Yes, they're running around hysterically
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  Like a factory full of chickens with their heads cut off
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  But does that convince us?
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  Does that endless wailing get us to submit
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  And then believe that we should be mad at Trump
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  And all that he's already gotten done and complained?
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  You know, if America falls for this
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  We deserve what we get
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  I don't deserve it, you don't deserve it
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  Our children don't deserve it
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  Those of us that have been fighting hard
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  We're not perfect
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  But we don't deserve North Korea
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  We don't deserve Venezuela
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  We don't deserve to be ruled by the likes of Al Gore
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Hippocratic, lying, charlatan, con man
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  Of the universe
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  Just something about that big swollen candy ass
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  Con man up there
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  I just...
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  You can't make up the sex stuff he's into, by the way
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Let's just continue
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  That the Trump presidency is bedeviled
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Is undeniable
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  As President Donald Trump flew off for August
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  At his Jersey club
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  Where he can get work done and not be surveilled
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  There came word that special counsel
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  Special independent counsel
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  His total Democrat operative, Robert Mueller
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  The third had impaneled a grand jury
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  And subpoenas were going out
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  The Trump family
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  And campaign associates
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  Yeah, Roger Stone's gotten one
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  And it says, give us all your Russia documents
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  Okay, there are none
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  It's like, say, give me all your Martian communiques
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  With the king of Sidonia
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  I don't have any communications with the king of Sidonia
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  The jurors will be drawn from a pool of citizens
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  In a city, Hillary Clinton swept
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  With 91% of the vote
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  Trump got 4%
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  Whatever indictments Mueller wants, Mueller gets
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  Yes, this is like, if you were divorcing your wife
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  And she is the family court judge
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  Over the case
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  It's the ultimate recusal case
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  But it's not happening
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  Thanks to a media that sabbages him ceaselessly
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  Trump was down to 33%
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  In the Quinnipiac University poll
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  I mean, give me a break
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  I've looked at all these polls
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Realistic as a Buck Rogers novel from 1921
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  They ain't real, it's called fiction
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  Before Trump departed D.C.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  The Washington Post ran transcripts of his phone
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  Conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  Even Obama administration veterans were stunned
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  So it's time to ask
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  If this city brings down Donald Trump
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  Will the rest of America rejoice?
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  I love how these conversations
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  With the Australian prime minister
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  And the Mexican president making him sound bad
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  It's the exact guy you see in public
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  Fighting for America and going
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  Hey, you got a wall on your southern border
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  You know you're sending criminals up here
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  To get deported 20 times
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  You don't let Americans come down there and do that
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  Stop it
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  You know with remittances
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  We send down 10 times the money you bring here
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  And look, all it's doing is driving down your wages too
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  We've looked at studies out of Canada
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  And studies out of...
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  I mean, this is the real guy
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  You're doing...
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  But that's so alien to everybody
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  That we'd actually have a president that's running things
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  And have a president that looks at the facts
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  I mean, it's just crazy
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  I'm not in some Trump worship fest
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  Just to be contrarian
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  It'd be easy to sit here and join
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  The people that didn't vote
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  And the Democrats and everybody
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  And play like the Republican establishment
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  And you know, put him down
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  And it's Monday morning quarter back
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  And go along with
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  Yeah, well, yeah, he needs to, yeah
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  What will be the reaction
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  Out there in flyover country
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  The land where the deplorables dwell
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  To produce the soldiers to fight the wars
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  Yeah, notice that
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  Will they toast the free press
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  That brought down the president they elected
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  And in whom they had placed so much hope
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  My guess, the reaction will be one of bitterness
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  Cynicism and despair
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  I won't be despair, it'll be action
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  We're winning, we've got beach ads so giant
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  We are winning, we are raging into their areas
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  We are dominating intellectually
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  If they take down Trump
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  They're going to try to kill the opposition
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  Absolutely, they've got the hit teams ready
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  With my name on it
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  But it doesn't matter
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  We're winning the intellectual war
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  Don't ever let them convince you
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  We're not winning, we're winning
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  We're promoting freedom and prosperity
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  What they're promoting is a complete joke
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  And all you gotta do is stop letting the little hunchbacks
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  Up there, the intellectual hunchbacks
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  Tell you they're the gods on CNN control your mind
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  You know they're the enemy, you know they're scum
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  They know, you know they hate you and your family
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  They know they're criminals, they know they're the scum
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  That can be hired by multinationals
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  And Nazi collaborators like Soros
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  To piss all over the country
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  It's not happening anymore, we're rising
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  We're winning, we're coming together
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  We're breaking the enemy
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  I can think of no greater honor
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  Than to be in the position to take on this trash
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  And to care less what they say or do
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  Whatever it is, fill their hand
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  Maximum a time, whatever they've got
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  It's in God's will, we will bring you down
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  It's a no-brainer, a Big Berkey water filter

[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  And other endocrine disruptors
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  Pesticides, bacteria, viruses
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  And much more, right?

[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  My blood pressure has normalized

[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look

[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  Who's overthrown and crashed economies of more than 100 nations
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  And who funds radical Islam, slaughtering Christians
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  And other Muslims worldwide
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  And who in the WikiLeaks is seeking to overthrow Israel
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  And have Israel ethnically purged of Jews
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  You can't make this stuff up
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  And then Israel has a tepid response by their foreign ministers
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  Saying, yeah, he's an enemy of Israel
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  And then his response is to try to overthrow the Israeli government
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  I mean, these people are incredible
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000]  I mean, you cannot make it up
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  And then meanwhile, Pat Buchanan has the big story
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  After the coup, what then?
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  And it goes on
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  After they overthrow Trump, he's saying, because that's the plan in D.C. now
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  Oh, see, I was the cook first saying it
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  Now it's all confirmed as I told you
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  My guess, the reaction will be one of bitterness, cynicism, despair
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  No, it's going to be focused anger and just total economic warfare
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  Pulling out of all the globalist systems
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  Pulling our children even more out of their systems
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  The military turning against the globalists completely
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  I mean, do you think what happened with Trump was anything? Just get ready
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  We're going to win peacefully
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  And then we're going to even let you stage false flags that you blame on us
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  But we'll expose you to it
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  I mean, we've got your number
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  Despair a sense of the fixes in that no matter what we do
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  They will not let us win
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  If Trump's brought down, American democracy will take a pasting
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  It will be seen as a fraud
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  And the backlash will poison our politics to where only an attack from abroad
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  Will unite us
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  Yeah, and we've already been conditioned to accept attacks
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  Like Stockholm syndrome, oh
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  You just give in to it
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  Get into it
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  But look at how ruined MSNBC and CNN and all these other people are
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  6% trust rates
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  It's only going to get worse and worse and worse
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  And everyone's pulling out of the fake liberal universities
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  They're collapsing as they become more mentally ill in man-free speech
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  And have cultural appropriation regulations passed that are directly out of Nazi Germany
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  Got an article on that today
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  There will just be an exodus of the sane people at a macro and micro level everywhere
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  And it's already happening
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  And then you will howl and scream and call for regulations to make us give you sooker
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  Give you truck
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  Bring you to our table
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  It's not going to happen
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  The exodus is accelerating in the world but not of it
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  And I look at people that think being patted on the head by the establishment
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  I mean if they tried to give me a Nobel Prize
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  I would throw it in the trash can
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  And I'd take the money and give it to victims of
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  Yilin sponsored forced abortion in China
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  Or something along those lines
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  But people like oh my gosh the prestige
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  I'm not just saying that
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  If they offered me a huge role in a major Hollywood movie starring in a major movie
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  I would say piss on that
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  And I have before two major roles
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  Because I don't want anything to do with any of that
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  If they offered me a Fox TV show I'd say no thank you
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  And I have Man Cow as a witness to me three times
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  Turning down my own Saturday or Sunday show
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  But I'd have to live in New York and they go oh but we're getting you ready to be on Fox all the time
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  I don't want to and then they had a Fox executive a few months later
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  In New York Daily News saying I wanted to be on Fox but they turned me down
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  Because seeing their religion they had to say I wanted them
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  No I don't want you
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  Just like Matt Drudge doesn't want to be on Fox you're a joke
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  I turned down the establishment back when I had nothing
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  And I'm not here bragging about myself
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  I'm trying to explain it might have been a little hard
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  20 years ago to turn down the establishment
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  But I was on like 10 radio stations
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  Might seem hard but it wasn't
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  Because I had vision, my integrity
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  But now it's a joke, isn't it?
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  Hollywood's gone from not being very cool to really being an uncool, hadn't it?
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  Hadn't it?
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.000]  Hadn't it? You can't get me to Los Angeles unless it's to go on Joe Rogan's podcast
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  And then all we discuss is why are we here?
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  He's like absolutely we should get out of here
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  Even if you're brought up over there I don't know how you can be around it
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  And so that's all I'm saying the world has nothing to offer past medicine
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  And transportation and the beautiful sights God gave us
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  And the system wants to keep you poor so you get that from them
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  Because once you get the hierarchy of needs and are successful in taking care of yourself and your family
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  You don't need them anymore then you realize all their culture is bondage
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000]  Everything they sell, everything they do from MTV to CNN
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  Is designed by psych warfare chiefs to ruin you mentally
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  To cripple you psychologically and spiritually
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  To control you and render you helpless
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  We're gonna look at Al Gore coming up
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  We're gonna look at his latest evil
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  We're gonna look at his latest evil
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  We're gonna look at his latest evil
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  We're gonna look at his latest evil
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  We're gonna look at his latest evil
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  They use their media to assassinate real news
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and awards shows to repeat their narrative over and over again
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  All to make them march, make them protest
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  Make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:47.000]  Bully and terrorize the law-abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  Is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  And I'm Freedom's Safest Place
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.000]  That patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  And to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShieldM4sLife.com
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Your schedule, your desktop, your details, your lives
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  Show us, your children, your photos, your home
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  Here, take credit, take insurance, take a loan
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  Get a job, get a pension, get a haircut, get a suit
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  Get a vaccine, get a nanotech lobotomy
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  Turn over your consciousness and die
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  It'll be so easy if you just roll over and die and give all the resources to Al Gore or Obama
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  Who told the Africans, you can't have cars, you can't have air conditioning
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  Then I can have a carbon footprint, 3,000 plus times bigger than the average Africans
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  That's Obama speaking metaphorically, rhetorically, and that's okay
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  It's making it cool to have a giant underclass that's economically discriminated against
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  And not give an access to life travel energy
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  And it's making the idea of upward mobility somehow evil
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  And that humans are evil, but now you've got the Liberals coming out and saying
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  Kill your dog, kill your cat, it's not enough to have flatulence taxes and bags on the cows in Canada
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  That's right, in Canada, big bags on their rear ends
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  Taking the evil methane away, oh my gosh
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  But now we need to kill your cat or dog, but don't worry, there'll be a tax
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  That's the radicals want to kill them, just let us tax it
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  This is their system of total control
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  So you can pay Al Gore and his little carbon tax company, Gore and Blood
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  I'm not kidding, that's the name of it, his partner's name, Blood
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  So you can pay him Carbon Indulgences
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  So that's coming up when we look at the latest fabulous corruption of Al Gore
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  And his new fake movie, Polar Bears Can't Swim
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  And of course 34 times more electricity at one house than your average house
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  I mean, what a joke, we're going to be looking at him here in a moment that mourn on North Korea
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  Mark Moreno is going to be joining us
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  In his latest film, he says that Manhattan was going to be under water and he predicted it
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  Yeah, in the slurry wall area where it always floods
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  Where they hadn't put the drains in yet when they rebuilt the World Trade Center
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  This is how he plays mind games with people
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  Yes, Lower Manhattan has always been getting hit by storms
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  So has Galveston, but don't worry, he'll pat you on the hand, he's the savior
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  That's all, and I know you know global warming's a fraud
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  The point is, the fraud is the takeover, the tax, what Trump pulled out of
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  The climate agreement is a global carbon tax of $100 trillion per decade according to the Davos Group
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  That's coming up with our guest in a moment
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  But first off, ladies and gentlemen, before we talk to Drew Johnson and Mark Moreno
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  We were like 50% supported by t-shirts and books and videos and supplements
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  But then Google ads through other companies banned us on advertising
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  And then we've had them go after any big sponsors we have, that's just what they do
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  They do it to everybody, they're openly saying kill the president on the news
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  And have a coup against him, this is what these people do
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  But because of that it's just made us stronger, we just go out at one of the biggest
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  Most successful shopping centers online, infowarstore.com
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  We go out and partner with game changing, high quality products like Alexa Pure
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  Water filters, but they also have Alexa Pure Breeze
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  When we first started promoting these, the average unit was $800 to $1,000
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  Comparable brands that had the same technology, they just miniaturized it
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  And quite frankly those companies were gouging you, things have gone down in prices because of miniaturization
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  At $219, it is the best deal out there
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  Got them in the house, got them at the office, but now at $149
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  We've extended this another week because it's so popular and they've still got supplies left
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  Then you can get the best deal out there on the Alexa Pure Breeze
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  There's so much particular, so much stuff in the house, so much stuff that gets in
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  You owe it to yourself, your children, you name it
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  And a little bit of money we make off this, if we sell enough of them, it's a lot of money
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  Help us hire more reporters, more crew, and do more
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  Got a three-phase filter system, carbon filter, pre-filter, true HEPA filter
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  And then an ion cluster
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  Now again, I bought units for like $890
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  Four years ago, my wife divorced me, moved out of the house
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  Went out, looked at the best filters, there were four-stage systems that were the best
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  $890
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  Then when Alexa Pure was coming out with this, I looked at the specs
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  It was as good as those in the same technology for $240 something then
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Now at $219
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  At $149, it is an amazing deal
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  Infowarsstore.com, take advantage of this today, I don't know why through the divorce part
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  You're moving out, you got a new glacier, buying things you already had at the other house
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  You go out, you see how much this stuff cost

[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  We also have the new super blue mouthwash in that my dad again developed
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  With one of the top makers in the country, the same folks that make the toms of Maine
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  My dad is a dentist and oral surgeon, so it's recommended by Dr. Jones on the front

[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  That everybody sign up for our free newsletter to get breaking news and analysis
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  Sometimes even the middle of the night, where it's in your inbox
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter

[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  To stop Trump, exclusive, McMaster, Soros, secretly working together
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  To stop Trump, McMaster leaking intel to Soros almost daily
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  Says Israeli intelligence highest levels
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  This is about to be confirmed by the Israeli ambassador to the United States
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  That's, we're told is going to happen this afternoon
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  They've been up McMaster's private emails, just like they've caught
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  The former attorney general doing it and her whole fake name
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  That's out there
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  Who is Carlisle? I mean, this is all coming out
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  This is damning, damning information
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now joining us is Drew Johnson
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  Comes highly recommended from Mark Moreno, he'll be popping in
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  For the next hour for a few minutes as well
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  He's a senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  He serves as senior scholar for taxpayers protection alliance
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  As well as a columnist for Newsmax, contributor to Daily Caller
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  And I'm not going to go over his whole bio
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  But he serves as president of the Beacon Center in Tennessee, a free market
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  Think Tank based in Nashville, he's also currently served as opinion editor

[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  I mean, I thought Al Gore saying in 2006 that by 2013
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  New York City would be under water and so would LA
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  And all the major coastlines would have a foot of whatever
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  And that polar bears couldn't swim and there's five times their numbers
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  Now, according to the government's own numbers
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  But now we've got even bigger whoppers
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  He's going to go over with us right now
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  We've got to expose this fraud, I know you know he's a fraud
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  But we have to understand school children, people in college campuses
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  They're being brainwashed and Gore arrives and everyone falls down and worships him
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  We're going to roll some video of that in a moment
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  I mean, this is disgusting
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  This is totally disgusting
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  So, again, thank you for coming on with us, Drew
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  I'm glad to be here, thanks for having me, Alex
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  Well, where to start? I mean, I mentioned some of it, let's start going through it here
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  Well, Al Gore in one year at his Nashville residence
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  Uses 21 times more electricity than the average American
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  So what you or I would use in 21 years
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  He uses in a year
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  Also, in some months, he uses up to 34 times the national average in energy
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  And we were able to isolate his pool usage because he has a different electric meter for it
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  To heat his pool, just to heat his pool
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  He uses six times more electricity than the average American uses in their household
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  So what your family uses in six years, he uses in a year just to heat his pool
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  It's incredible
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  Let's walk through this, here's the article from the Daily Caller
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  A article you wrote, former VP's home energy usurges
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  The 34 times the national average despite costly green renovations
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  And he owns, last time I checked, just like JK Rawlings
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  I think she's got 10 Palace style houses
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  Last time I heard Gore's got six homes we know of
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  Tennessee, California
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  I mean, let's talk about, anybody can just Google Al Gore's homes, they're just gigantor
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  Let's talk about those
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  Sure, yeah, so this is the guy who expects us basically to wash our clothes in a creek
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  Or something like that and hang them on a line and walk to work
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  And this is the guy who has two houses in Tennessee, a house in San Francisco
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  He bought his former wife, Tipper, a house in Montecito, California by the ocean
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  He supposedly also has a house in London, so there we're up to five houses
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  So my report is only talking about one house, and this doesn't include his 100 foot houseboat
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  His private jets, the travel he does on private plans
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  So this is a guy who is just a hypocrite, he's unwilling to live his own life
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  By the standards that he expects from you and me
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  And what's crazy is it's not just him
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  Every one of these global warmer pay us carbon tax people
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  Know it's a scam, and then they tell you that the sea levels are going to rise
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  Then they buy 10, 20 million dollar, 30 million dollar houses right on the beach
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  You know, 10, 15 years ago, and guess what? They're not underwater
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  Those big articles out with crab farmers that have been doing this 50 years
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  Saying it hasn't gone up or down one centimeter
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  I think when you get down to it, you're hitting on exactly the right point
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  Gore, I don't believe after looking at his electric bills now for 10 or 11 years
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  I don't believe he believes in this crap
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  I think he has basically helped cultivate a religion
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  A religion of environmental zealots who see him as a prophet
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  And will do whatever he wants and whatever he tells him
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  And he's been able to make 300 million dollars off of this religion
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  So whether or not it's true, he doesn't really care
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  Because he went from being worth 2 million dollars when he left the White House
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  As Vice President to 300 million dollars today
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  And I think if you really believed it, you know, he tells us that it's the most pressing issue
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  Climate change is the most pressing issue facing our world today
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  Our kids will basically curse our names for not doing more
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  And yet he has a power bill or electricity usage at his one house
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  That is 21 times the national average
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  He would do more in his personal life, but he doesn't because he just doesn't believe it
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  And he's making millions of dollars off of it
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  You know, they've gotten what 16 attorney generals together under COMOS
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  Control the New York in different states
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  And they're trying to have criminal charges against Mark Moreno
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  Criminal charges against Lord Monkton
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  That everybody's involved in frauds secretly for saying
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  Man-made climate change isn't real or isn't really, you know, registrable
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000]  And isn't causative of change
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  Of course we believe there's change
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  First it's freezing, then it's warming
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  Now they just go change
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  Any change is you, pay us money, we're your gods
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  I mean, it's totally insane
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  But they've taught the school children this
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  So they're just marching forward regardless
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  And now they're mad that Trump has pulled out of their carbon tax
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  That again, only a handful of countries had to be under
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  I mean, it's just wild that they just keep moving forward
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000]  Despite the fact that we have their own emails admitting it's all a fraud
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  From East Anglia directing hundreds of universities on how to hide the decline
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  Well that's because it's not about the science
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  It's about, number one, for some of these people like Gore
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  Making some money, making a quick buck and finding a good racket
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  And number two, it's about advancing progressive policies
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  It's about socialism, it's about communism
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  It's about the government controlling the means of production
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  And telling a lot of people carbon taxes will regulate every facet of life
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  It's a total tax heaven
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  It's exactly right, it will control what you can do for a living
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  What people can produce in their factories, in their homes, in their businesses
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  It's really a way to control and micromanage our economy
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  And it's ultimately going to take away most of the free market that is built
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  Not only in the United States, but the developed world
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  Into such a wonderful place, it basically is an attack on our core beliefs and our values
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  Well it's like British sponsored TV, taxpayer funded television
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  BBC runs these cartoons for kids that says
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  In the future, we'll tell you where you're going to work
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  You'll have meat once a year, all because of the carbon
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  And you'll have a job at a carbon scrubber getting rid of carbon
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  For me, it's such a cult of brainwashing, but also it diverts us
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  From all the real environmental stuff that we should be aware of
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  It just becomes this takeover of all environmental debate
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  And Mark can speak to this better than I can
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  But today, it's the best time to be alive
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  Water is cleaner than it's been in decades
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  There are more trees than there were when Columbus landed in the United States
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  The air is cleaner than it's been in 30 years
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  All these good things are happening, and it's not because of radical environmentalists
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  It's not because of Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio, or Tom Steyer
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  Any of these idiots, it's because of the marketplace
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  And because we have the luxury as Americans
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  We don't have to worry about our kids dying of malaria and not having enough to eat
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  We're fortunate to have the money and the leisure really to concern ourselves with the environment
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  And also to make decisions in our own lives about what is a more energy efficient appliance
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  Or what's a more fuel efficient car
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  And so the marketplace takes care of so many of these issues
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  And the environment is cleaner as a result
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  It's not cleaner because of socialism
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  I've been in some socialist countries the last few years
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  And they're dirtier, they're nastier, they're way worse than America, that's for sure
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  By the way, I'm going to find it during the break and play some of it
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  The mega-opolis TV shows for kids where they teach them that
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  You know, you're going to tell you what you're going to do
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  You can't travel unless you're authorized to leave your house
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  We tell you what job you're going to have
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  And they're describing a total prison
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  For the school children in England, this is what they're teaching them
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  That's exactly right
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  And I think one thing that's really important is that
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  A lot of the things that the Al Gore's of the world are telling us to do
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  Are really that effective in helping the climate or helping the environment or whatever
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  It's very effective in helping Al Gore make a heck of a lot of money
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  Because he's got investments in solar panels
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  He's got investments in carbon offsets and things like that
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  And as a matter of fact, ten years ago, I found Al Gore's utility bills and exposed them
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  At the time, they were about 19 times the national average
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  Yeah, I should have built
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  You're the guy that's famous for a lot of stuff
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  But for digging up the utility bills, which are public
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  I like to shame you of your water main breaks
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  I've had that happen once where it was an internal leak
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  You know, for three weeks we didn't know about
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  So I was in the top 15 water wasters in Austin
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  So they published my name in the paper
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  So let's briefly talk about how were you able to find Al Gore's bills
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  Yeah, going back ten years ago, they were a matter of public record
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  Anybody could get them
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  And at that time I exposed, like I said, that he used about 19 times more electricity
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  And he pulled this whole evangelist, I have sin sort of thing
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  And he spent about $300,000 putting on solar panels
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  Putting in geothermal heating, new appliances, new windows, insulation
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  And after he spent $300,000 and said, okay, now I've got my life buttoned up
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  It's under control, I'm reducing my carbon footprint
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  We find out that he now uses more electricity
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  Stay there, we'll be back
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  It's been said, any society has only three missed meals away from chaos
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  Those times may be near
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  From Russia and North Korea
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  From a single cyber attack
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  The government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in

[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  It's been sold out for months, big waiting list, limited amount
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  Because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  Nobody's got something that's good
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  Say 30% off of MycoZX and get the gut health support back
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  When you get it with the biome defense

[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  Probiotic MycoZX contains seven of the world's most powerful organic

[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  You know, have terrible bowel and Crohn's type stuff
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  That didn't exist 50 years ago, now it's epidemic
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  And tell you what it did for them

[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors

[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had Roger Stone on earlier in the first hour
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  We're going to be posting that interview to Infowars.com very soon in Kit Daniel's breaking news story
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  Exclusive McMasters Soros secretly working together to stop Trump
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  And that's a powerful headline by Kit Daniel's, but it's not even strong enough
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  McMasters caught by Intelligence Agency working for Soros reorganizing the White House
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  I mean, that's what's really going on
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  Intelligence Agency caught McMasters briefing Soros on the reorganization of the White House
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  And now, this is breaking, McMaster former group scrubs then re-ads Soros financing from the website
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  As if we're so stupid they took down where Soros was the main funder of his group
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  This is incredible and then because it was on the Google way back machine everywhere else
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  They had to add it back, the Streisand effect, that's going to be added to Kit Daniel's article
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  This is key, get that article out to everybody
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  Wow, now going back to our guests, Drew Johnson
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  You were getting cut off by the break just getting into Al Gore and his new movie is even more ridiculous
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  Face to face, Moreno confronts Gore with Climate Hustle DVD in Australia
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  Gore refuses to accept, departs an SUV, we're going to play that coming up when Moreno joins us
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  So let's get that clip, but other tidbits people need to know about this guy
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  Yeah, I mean, so this guy spent $300,000 making his house greener
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  And it's actually less efficient today than it was before he spent $300,000 on it
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  Or at least he consumes more energy so I guess he thought he could get away with it
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  But his argument is always, well I use carbon offsets, I offset my energy and my home uses 100% renewable
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  Well the offsets he buys are often from a company that he has a stake in, that he is a part owner of
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  So he's not really buying carbon offsets and this whole silly thing about 100% of the energy in his house is renewable
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  It's a lie, it's complete BS because he gets the same electricity that everybody else in Nashville gets
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  Which is about maybe 15% renewable if you tilt your head and squint just right
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  And then you add his solar panels, that's about 5% of his electricity usage
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  So if you give him the benefit of the doubt, 80% of his electricity usage is non-renewable
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  But this liar says 100% is renewable, so you can't believe a word he says
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  You know we should probably search engine that goers home in Tennessee and show that to TV viewers
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  But it's palatial, but he's got other houses, has anybody ever looked at the energy at the other houses?
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  I know they've looked at ES houses right on the beach and then of course they never flooded like he said they would
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  Why would he buy some expensive house or why would Madonna, why would Hillary, it's the same story
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  Well they're total hypocrites, just fear mongering
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  Yeah, the way I was able to get these records is because Tennessee has more lacks laws about obtaining electricity bills
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  So it's harder to do in California and some of these other places
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  But we shouldn't have to look for it, we should say Al Gore, prove to us if we're supposed to follow your teachings
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  If you're supposed to be this prophet for the environment, for environmentalism
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  He should be able to say, here's what I do in my own life and this is why you should follow me
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  Sort of like at Baylor's Junior, I mean this guy lives completely off the grid
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  But Al Gore, the guy who's preaching to us every day and making movie after movie about how to live
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  Yeah, if folks want to live off the grid and self-sufficiently, that's great, but that's not what the big environs are pushing
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  They're pushing wind farms and scams and cutting down trees to cut carbon and saying carbon dioxide is bad when it's a trace life-giving gas
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  They just want to run things, I admire people that have sustainable real farms and do all that
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  That's great, that is the future, but that's not what they're pushing
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  Let's talk about their plantopolis, it's plantopolis, I was calling it mega-opolis
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  I was killing the crew, they were trying to find it, we have that
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  We'll do five more minutes with our guest then, we'll be joined by Mark Moreno, we'll get into his confrontation
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  With Al Gore, the latest on North Korea and more, whatever you do, spread the live feed
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  infowars.com for its last show, visit GCNLive.com today

[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  Face to face, Moreno confronts Gore with Climate Hustle DVD in Australia, nor refuses to accept it departs in an SUV
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  That's coming up North Korea and a lot more. Well the North Korea thing, we get so used to just being there and the horrible dictatorship
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  That ICBMs, they can hit the US and who do you think? It's like the disease that keeps giving the Clinton administration
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  Oh, I tell ya, it just never ends
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  And you know, you talk about North Korea, I've never seen anybody else that's overweight there except Kim Jong-un
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  But I've seen on Fox News one other guy that's a little bit overweight like Kim Jong-un
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  So Kim Jong-un is like grabbing by the arm deciding to eat him
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  And I make jokes, but authoritarians always want to control resources to control people
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  It's simple, in the real world and in the world of the Autobots, the Decepticons, one control of the Energon cubes
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  And their leader Al Gore, the evil pig walrus man bear pig, must be defeated
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  Autobots form a battle cruiser and defeat them in the information war
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  I am your leader, Optimus Prime, okay, I'm really getting weirder
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  I'm having some fun, ladies and gentlemen, few final comments from our guest
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  But I want to play a minute or two of the Planned Opolis that is shown to British schoolchildren
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  Here it is
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  Very exciting
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  Hi, I'm so glad you're on time
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  I'm V, I'm looking forward to showing you around Planned Opolis today
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  My husband works from home, he's a virtual engineer working in one of the city's desalination plants
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  He controls the robots who do all the important maintenance
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  I think he basically plays computer games for a living
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  Thanks
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  You ready to go? Have you got your calorie card open on your smartphone?
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp the other day, so they've allotted you a journey time to match mine
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it? Switch off brain and go to work
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  With this many people around, I'm glad there's a mega computer in charge
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  We're so lucky, our kids were allocated to school quite near my practice, so I don't drop them off on the way
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  I didn't save on our calorie ration
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  Well, it won't be long until the little darlings get their career announcements
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000]  They've been working so hard, so I'm sure they'll get something good
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  Not that there's anything wrong with fixing carbon scrubbers for a living or anything
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  Are you hungry? Let's pop to the market as we're passing
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  Right, what's on the menu this month?
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  No, not meat, it's not your birthday
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  Let's stop right there, I want to give our guests a chance to respond
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  You think this is satire? It's not, it's like when they go
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  Mother and father is bad on the entrance forms for elementary students
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  Men and women existing is hurtful
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  You may not use the term male or female
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  First, it's be open to other people that want to say they're a dog or a giraffe
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  Or a man that says they're a woman and is going to have a baby or whatever
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  But now, just existing is bad
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  The Global Calorie Council is going to decide
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  I mean, this is pure authoritarianism, my friend
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  Yeah, I mean, the calorie rations
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  That's exactly what Al Gore wants with electricity rations
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  And with, you know, companies can have this much production and this much productivity
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  But again, he refuses to do it in his own life
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  And it doesn't matter to him, he's such an elitist
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  And he's so full of himself that he's just concerned with sort of micromanaging the peasants
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  And his followers are that stupid, I mean
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  Bloomberg admits that he runs everything and wants to tell us what to do
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  He says in articles, he's the one programming at all
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  That's right, yeah, I think Gore sees himself that way
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  And that's why he loves this sort of socialist ideology that he follows
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  Because he sees himself up at the top pulling the levers
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  I live in a big bloated mansion, you have nothing, it's liberal
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  Exactly, yeah, and he again owns everything at the end
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  He owns the carbon offsets and the solar panels and things like that
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  So there's always money to be made by Gore
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  I tell you, that's a cool looking houseboat
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  But it's okay for him to have that, just we can't have anything
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  Well, listen, I want to send you an external mic because you're a great guest
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  But I want to get rid of that hum
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  I'd like to invite you to join us more often, sir Drew Johnson with NationalCenter.org
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  You are fabulous, and what is that in the background there?
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  Is that hockey leagues or what is that?
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  Yeah, actually, when I go to Europe or overseas, I get a hockey scarf or a soccer scarf
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  But one of them is Russian, so you...
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  Oh, I knew you were one of them
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  You didn't like my stare
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  It's available at mforestore.com, we also have free shipping, orders $50 or more and 10% off
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000]  We sign up for auto-ship additionally on top of that

[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:25.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time

[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  Mark Moreno is our guest, he's been traveling the world, they've had arrest warrants out for him, they want him arrested here in the United States, the governor of New York wants him arrested
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:31.000]  Because he dares questions Al Gore, when Al Gore says the polar bears are all dying and can't swim and that New York and LA would be under water by 2013 because the ice caps are going to melt actually and Arctic's at record levels, but they don't care because they can defraud the public
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  It's always important to pop in and look at what Trump's doing, killing the Paris carbon accords that they have spent massive amounts of money, well last Moreno has been a top congressional advisor on this, one of the leading experts in the world
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  Last time I checked it was close to 100 billion just on the propaganda and of course in paying their own firms Al Gore's made 300 million and now they want carbon indulgences and this is how they're going to fund the world government and micromanage and regulate everything
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  But recently in Australia he ran into Albert Gore, the guy that told us NAFTA and GATT was great and wanted us to have the TPP, the guy who uses 34 times what anybody uses on average in Tennessee, one of his gigantor mansions on a lake with gigantor boats and gigantor monster trucks
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  and gigantor everything, but it's okay because he's an elitist blubberbot, a brain bug, so here's the evil criminal Mark Moreno daring to even speak to the guru, here it is
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  Oh, nice to see you, thank you
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  Can I ask how you got in here, we've got double scum with us here, they did talk to one of the greatest con artists on earth, how dare you speak to the royalitis, you're on fit to groove his stool, Dave
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  Moreno did a great job, you can tell they didn't know he was coming out, they caught it, but the key is to get their hand, go lord go, ah, and then you get there, oh your lord ship, and then you just shoot your hand out
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  and then you, ah good to have, oh here's your DVD, but hey, they got the fish in the boat, so that's better than I did, I just wish that I could confront Al Gore
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  I should have confronted him once before, but you gotta watch, well once they know who Mark Moreno is, speaking of the evil Mark Moreno who didn't want America to be one of the only countries under the carbon tax
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  who didn't want to shut down more of our factories, the evil person who joins us, maybe I should conduct this interview in an elitist accent, he just feels much better
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, what do you say for yourself?
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  Thank you for having me on Alex, yes I was in Australia, we were in Melbourne Australia and I had to sit through an hour and a half presentation by Al Gore previewing his new sequel
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  and not only that, but they had us wait, people paid over $500 ahead to see Al Gore, I don't know where that money went, number one, number two, well I have a pretty good idea where the money went, but number two
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  we had to wait because Al Gore's devious plan included allowing the front rows and the first people allowed in to be the Australian teachers association
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  and all the school teachers and elementary school teachers, so they packed the audience with teachers because Al Gore knows you've got to get kids whether young and propaganda items
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  so they packed them and Al Gore gives this presentation, it's all anecdotal, just claptrap and then immediately walks off the stage, he doesn't even take a single question after people paid $500 plus ahead
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  he had no time for question and answer, so that's why I decided to follow him out, was able to get that, he was all friendly when he thought I was nice when he knew who I was
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  he literally just brushed me off, kept walking and departed in his Lexus waiting SUV outside in the parking garage
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  and I love how there's some redhead lady toting behind, she's looking at him breathing heavy, she's just near him
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  the guru, I saw him sneeze, some of his snag, snot went in my mouth
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  and then she looks at you just like, all right
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  we actually free-trained it, I held up a picture of the DVD, Climate Hustle, which is now available DVD and non-demand at climatehustle.com
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  but she actually looked down and I free-trained the pictures on my website at Climate Depot, her face is in horror as she's looking at the DVD when she realizes who we are and what we're doing there
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  but this didn't stop Al Gore because he then went to the SUV and anyone around the rest of the country, Australia's got the same kind of climate activists and the influences on government that we have here in the United States
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  and they have an area in southwest Australia that's literally going to blackouts because of all the alleged renewable energy, banning carbon-based energy that's proven successful over the last 150 years
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  Gore goes out of his way to praise the area that's the most utter disaster of Australia and thereby enraging a lot of Australians
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  but I did want to get on Australian National Sky TV and a bunch of shows and national radio so Australians are very receptive to skepticism
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  but they have the same problems that we had until Donald Trump came that they were sort of hijacked by that political system
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  but Gore has been traveling the world now, heading off to Europe to premiere his film
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  but luckily his film has tanked at the box office, he came in now 15th, 16th and this is despite being on more screens than his original film was on
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  the way that woman in green looks at it, and again everything they're doing is turning to absolute garbage because everyone knows they're a fraud
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  but the last little drooling cult member idiots, I mean this is ridiculous
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:25.000]  what's fascinating about all this is Al Gore, despite the fact that every venture he's pretty much done since his sequel, in terms of public rating has collapsed
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  his live earth concerts, his 24 hours of climate reality, he was doing the day of the Paris attacks, one of these climate reality tours
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:41.000]  with Pia with musicians and everything and get the cancel after four or five hours because of the terror attacks
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  he's up there on stage essentially declaring the greatest threat we've faced is climate change
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  as the terrorists are bombing a few blocks away and he actually put this in his sequel
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  so we get to see this humiliating embarrassment that is Al Gore claiming climate is the greatest threat
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  well they're being bombed a few blocks away by Islamic terrorists in Paris in 2015, it is a great moment in the film
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  but I don't think it's what Al Gore intended people to take away from it
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  well they also go, oh Islamic terror, well I don't say Islamic terror, they say
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  terrorism is increasing in migrants because of the climate change, pay me money, I'll fix it
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  after the very same globalists have wrecked the third world, they're now bringing in huge third world populations that are Islamic
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  weaponizing them and then going, climate, climate change caused it, oh no, don't show me Moreno's video
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  don't get climate hustle, that info was, there it is, I can't, I mean that's how she looks at it
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  like it's a giant 20 pound cockroach
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  this is a great moment though for climate skeptics and for Liberty Loving Americans because Al Gore's films tanking
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  Donald Trump's pulled us out of Paris where he's reversed all of Obama's executive orders, we're not out of the woods yet
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  because the environmental groups are now suing through all the court system and up in the Supreme Court
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  I don't have confidence with the current Supreme Court to force Donald Trump to re-regulate carbon dioxide
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  what do you tell from our mouth as a pollutant, they're trying to declare human breath a toxic product
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  I hope they rally, I hope they rally and defeat everyone
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  here's the goodness though, you know most of these Bloomberg anti-gun law suits are getting thrown out
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  and the people are having to pay the attorney's fees, have you been reading about that?
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  No, I didn't see that, no, I haven't
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  Mr Moreno, what do you think about it, sorry go ahead
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  at Climate Depot today, the climate activists are beside themselves, first of all
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  the activists are saying this wasn't supposed to happen, this has to be sabotaged
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  you're accusing Paramount Pictures, the producer of Al Gore's film, of sabotaging the movie
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  because it's doing so poorly
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  that's number one, number two, we have a New Mexico professor, college professor
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  now calling for crimes against humanity
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  and I've actually been labelled along with Senator Inhofe, Lord Monkden and a few others
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  to already have the death penalty, it's on a public web page
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  a public professor, college professor is an astronomer
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  calling for the death penalty for me after his showed trial, sham trial, crimes against humanity
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  this is how bad, they're ratcheting it up and they're openly calling for death
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  now is the New York Times covering this and calling it hate speech, they don't seem to care
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  well in fact I'm actually jealous that I'm not on the group that's slated for death immediately
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  I mean that you're actually doing better than I am on there
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  but we joke around, in Europe and other places they're actually trying to call it climate denial
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  and trying to get judges to go after people, I mean these are authoritarians on every level
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:55.000]  so what's their latest attack, as culture turns against them and they try to turn to younger and younger children
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  to brainwash them and show them computer generations of drowning polar bears to make them cry
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:06.000]  and say you're a bad child, you're a bad child, worship gore, he'll save the little possums and everything
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  I mean how are they counter-striking?
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  Well they're counter-striking, one of the things Bill Nye actually called out and said we have to wait
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  for the climate skeptics to die off because he's so confident that he's been able to brainwash younger generations
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  and pulling down a bear without young people or big believers in the climate scare
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  the weather channel did an atrocious video of elementary school kids warning of the climate crisis
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:35.000]  wanting to save polar bears, telling their parents they had to be more green in order to save the climate
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  Bill Nye wants the climate skeptics to die off
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:44.000]  He's the one that also had his old show edited where they talk about mommies and daddies and the chromosomes
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  and what makes boys and girls because that doesn't exist because Bill Nye said so
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  Oh yes, a total war on science by a group of people that have our children
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.000]  so we're laughing about it but it's not funny, we've got to take control of the education system
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:03.000]  I want to get Mark Moreno's take on Trump and the current battle there
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:29.000]  so they can take down our leader, they're going to get their carbon tax through to stay with us
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  Are you one of the 15 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate?
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:46.000]  If your life revolves around finding the closest bathroom, if you're tired of waking up many times the night to urinate
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.000]  then you need to know about prostate miracle

[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  Ronald Reagan when he was elected scared the political class he established in Washington
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  But after his first term, the first couple years, Reagan really was quite a revolutionary
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:50.000]  But then he settled in by his second term he became part of the establishment
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  And many conservatives are very upset with Ronald Reagan when he deals with the Soviet Union
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  And he just sort of drifted away and accepted the status quo
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  George H.W. Bush was the Washington establishment
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  Bob Dole when he ran 96 was the Washington establishment
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  George W. Bush was the Washington establishment
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  John McCain was the Washington establishment until 2012
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  Mitt Romney, he was the Washington establishment
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  He's actually recommended to Trump that we stayed in the Paris Agreement right before Trump pulled up
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.000]  Then McCain would have stayed in, Casey would have stayed in, Jeff Bush would have stayed in
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  But is Trump not the total maverick, the maverick he said he would be? That's why they hate him?
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  Yes, what I'm trying to get to is, Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the existing political classes
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  World Order for a couple of simple reasons
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  The man can't be owned and bought by anyone
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  He can't be blackmailed, he can't be intimidated
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  He, what Pat Buchanan actually said in the 1980s is we need a president in Washington
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  Who will treasure their negative notices in the Washington Post and New York Times
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  We actually, for the first time in our modern history, have a president who actually goes out of his way
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  And delights in negative publicity
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  And I know people, fellow Republicans are in horror
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:10.000]  You know, I just did a Fox News, Sam Harris, I went, I actually had Fox News headquarters in D.C.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  And I just left the green room doing a segment tonight
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  And just talking to other Republicans, there's a lot of timidity among Republicans
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  Of, oh, Trump is, he's got a tone of doubt, he's got this, no, I think Donald Trump is doing it exactly right
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  We need an alien political force to upset, to offend, to waive political incorrectness
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  And because of that, he's the greatest threat to the Washington political establishment
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  The things he does, the way he's doing them is profound
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  Now, he has room for improvement, I wish he could get the Republicans, I wish he could coax Republicans to pass them
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  But that's their fault, that's their fault
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  I'm not really happy with gridlock for the next four years
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  In my mind, Trump's presidency is already wildly successful
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  Oh, I totally agree, and I've seen Fox make a turn against him
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  Because the establishment is scared, he's really delivering, and the economy shows it
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  And it's just incredible, and we should all be very, very thankful
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  But a lot of, like you said, establishment people really think what CNN says about you mean something
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  It's good to be called things by them, it's wonderful
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.000]  But you've still got a bunch of followers putting power by the establishment who got there
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:20.000]  Not because they're leaders, but because they're followers, and they still think MSNBC and CNN matter
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  They still think having NBC, or ABC come after you is bad
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  They don't understand that this is absolutely critical, and that Trump is delivering wildly
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  And we should all just be giddy, and they're putting out more fake polls saying he's in trouble
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  Mark Moreno, thank you so much, Climate Hustle, available at infowarstore.com

[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:50.000]  Mark Moreno is so on target, he's so absolutely on target
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:56.000]  I mean, Trump hadn't gotten his tax cutter Obamacare through because the enemies in Congress, both parties
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000]  Get more freedom caucus people elected
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  The Empire's on the line
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000]  He's got everything else done, he's doing exactly what he said he did, it's unprecedented
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:08.000]  It's just, it's winning, winning, winning, winning, winning
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:13.000]  Why is the fungus? Why is the mold? Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000]  What is going on? What has changed?
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:22.000]  Dr. Group, the new product, Myco ZX, supports normal fungal and yeast balance proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes

[02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:02.000]  And you can't support an organization that didn't fight hard
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.000]  Look at the response we're getting, whoever changed the world together

[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:45.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store
[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000]  There is no comparison
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:56.000]  Harvest-write freeze-dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years
[02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:00.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:04.000]  Harvest-write is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze-dryer

[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:31.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:38.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body

[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  So, here is the big news
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  The economy is roaring back in many areas
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  The regulations, the controls the globalists have put on us
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:04.000]  Publicly, to shut down the United States and transfer our industry to China mainly
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  So that our economic destiny could be dictated to us, that's how you make people surrender, you put them under siege
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  And now Trump is breaking the siege against America, and small business numbers are the biggest basically ever recorded in modern history
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  That's in the news today
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  They are responding by throwing hissy fits in the controlled corporate fake news factories that are CNN and others saying
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  Oh, we have new polls, he's never been less popular, everyone hates him, oh no one trusts him, oh the economy is terrible
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:44.000]  Oh, everyone agrees, stop tweeting
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  And they just become hysterical every day, like cult members, you know, believing if they go stand on a mountain top, flying saucers are going to finally land and take them away and finally the cult leader says just drink vodka and take barbiturates and wear Nike tennis shoes and your spirit will go up there
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  Yeah, let's kill ourselves
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  But black Nike tennis shoes are key
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  It's like a ghost dance, like the Native Americans did when they thought they were defeated, which they were, a very sad story, they would dance around out west and sometimes weeks on end having hallucinations on drugs
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  Just believing that their ancestors would come back, things would get better, they could reverse it
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  Well, you've got the globalist ghost dance, the pedophile ghost dance going on, the devil worshiper ghost dance, I don't really feel sorry for them
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  And they're dancing around, dancing around, staring at the sun, taking as much political peyote as possible, this is an allegory, a parallel, an example, a comparison, a parable, and I'm not saying for real this is happening
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  And they don't know what to do now because their god, Hillary, their queen, their king Soros, just can't deliver
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  He's been able to topple third world countries and bankrupt and steal the pension funds and rape and rob and turn the Muslims loose and slaughter
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  But here in the big fat juicy America, the flyover country, they just, they got rid of our jobs and they're teaching our kids how to be trannies and how to, you know, perform oral sex at age five and how to hate mommy and daddy
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  And how to play video games all day, but they just can't get all the rest of it done quite quick enough
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:42.000]  And so they just keep churning out, just stop responding to us, don't point out when we say you're very unpopular that we put out all those fake polls before and don't put out other algorithm documents showing that you're as popular as you've ever been
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  Except for the week of the nomination, he was higher than, just stop, listen it's best for you if you just shut up, let us put handcuffs on you and get in the car
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  It's like Ted Bundy, pull up, non-threatening yellow Volkswagen with a little non-threatening suit, he'd go, hey, want to go get some soda pop with me and maybe see a rock show? He'd get the 16-year-old girl in his car and he'd put a gun to her and he said, listen, I'm not going to hurt you as long as you put these handcuffs on
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  And so he puts the handcuffs on, he goes, good, good, it's going to be all right now, I'm going to take you out to this farmhouse and he takes her down in the basement and he tortures her for a few days and bites big chunks out of her, laughing at her saying, ah, you just want to run, you'd be alive, bitch, but you're not now and I'm going to kill you
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  Ah, ha, ha, ha, they get off on the crying and begging, oh, no one can hear you, I'm going to kill you now, I'm going to torture you to death and that's how CNN is, listen Trump, just stop using that Twitter and just put these handcuffs on and get down in this basement, never mind those pliers on the wall and the smell of dead flesh, that skull you see over there, just get in there with us
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  We only fund the air of spring and mass murder every question we can, we only want to sexualize the children, we're a bunch of pedophiles at CNN, just do what we want right now, stop communicating
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  But they go, if we totally shut him off of it, people will get mad, then block all the positive mentions and block the likes and just shut them down and destroy all the supporters
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  Trump to vote, voters to Trump, never tweet, just stop it, just get in the Volkswagen, put on the handcuffs and we're going to take good care of you, Trump
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  America, fly over country, just let us have your children, just put the handcuffs on, let us put the electrical tape on you, let us just go into the basement, just go into the basement
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  Ice cream truck music, all in all, white van pulls up, creepy PCP head, hey kids I got free candy and popsicles and the kids are like, oh look I got a puppy right here, hey look I got another little kid we call Renfield
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  We use him to lure other kids back, yeah it's my cousin's kid so you know I just torture him some, but he's going to come out with the puppy and he's going to trick you into this van kid and I'm going to sell you
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:24.000]  I'm going to Shanghai and put you on a boat and ship you out of here, listen folks want to produce some snuff films, but it's okay because they're liberal, it's okay because it's trending, you know, spirit cooking,
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:44.000]  good people, good people, got to take care of you, big deal we want to kidnap and rape your kids and devil worship, we're liberal, it's okay huh, now don't say mother and father on the entrance forms, being a mother and father is a bad thing
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  okay, alright, the crazy Alice Jones, you know, reads our documents on air and so what, what are they going to do to her, there you go
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  so seeing in Brian Stelter, hi I'm Brian Stelter, central casting of a creeperzoid, hi I'm Brian Stelter, hi
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  let me tell you about the real world, oh and Trump says something it's not true, when we tell you it is, the thing he said the other day about Trump and Trump's new news service, real news
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  is it's almost as funny as Como going, now these WikiLeaks, we're allowed to look at them because we're the media, you're not, you'll be arrested, you have to, I look at that and I tell you what you're allowed to hear, okay
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  let me talk to you like you're three years old, you have to use that potty in there, okay, and then you're only allowed one cookie, now let me talk to you like you're three, you don't see the WikiLeaks, okay
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  we tell you what to think, Brian Stelter, hi I'm Brian Stelter, hey the beta male who wants to act like John Wayne, oh now you know there's a Trump there, he has that graphic there, one of our former reporters
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  and it's supposed to look like they're the news but they're not, it's propaganda, what, jobs numbers, stock market numbers, numbers of the border being shut down
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  and they don't know what to do, they're just like oh my gosh, it just goes on and on, meanwhile Brian Stelter
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  you know what, I want to play this and then we're going to come back and get to the North Korea days, we've gotten, I don't want to exaggerate,
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  Du was telling me yesterday 200 good ones and he estimates hundreds of horrible ones, but by the way the horrible ones are the best ones, the problem is the contest is so successful it's shut down half the building, so we were already going to announce the winner this Friday, I've got to put the contest in a limbo a few weeks, I've done this before I always pay out on our contest
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  because I've spent hours and hours this week alone and this weekend watching them and there's Gregorian monk chant ones and there's rock and roll ones and hip hop ones and beautiful and auto tune and then the train wreck ones
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  and hillbilly ones and country music, I'm talking about the we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet, gonna stab your daughter at the mall, gonna stab your wife, your son, gonna stab them with a butcher knife
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:45.000]  and then the police chief says, oh we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  there you go, wow, now there's hundreds of these and Super Deluxe put this out to attack us and thought it would hurt his time-warner and then it got 27 million views, 14 million on Facebook alone and then they disabled them and shut them down and blocked them or put glitches on them so people can't see them
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  but when the higher ups went, he's right, they love it, shut it off, too late scum, it's constantly happening
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  if you ever put your knife and then the police chief is gonna say, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  now, I don't know what you call the name of this one, look at these, I watched like six or seven years of this in his office, he goes, this one's from the Philippines, I don't know the name of the video, we should put it on screen, I just kind of blurted it out to them in the break, hey get one of those videos, I'm not sure which one they've gotten ready
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  and that's the problem, how do you do justice to all these, I'm told they're gonna have a live transmission tonight for like three hours playing them, it'll be on InfoWars.com
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  but we'll look up the artist here and give them credit in a moment, but these are the kind of folks that are in the running because her voice is so pretty and it's her brother playing the acoustic guitar with her
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  so this is just how we get people involved in taking their attacks on us, turning it around against them and then they realize we're defeating them in panic and censor even more which only blows up in their face even better, so here it is
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:36.000]  I'm angry, I've had enough of these people, they're a bunch of Christian women scum that run giant death factories keeping babies alive and selling their body parts
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:54.000]  but more do you need to know about these people, I go out and face these scum, they literally crawl out from under rocks, they have green-looking skin, they run around screaming we love Satan, we wanna eat babies
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:13.000]  I have them on video, Hillary's in a creepy lipstick stuff man, she sleeps in the same room with that creepy weirdo woman whose mother wears her hood over her head
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  but the hell, that woman number one is ugly, imagine how bad she spells that, I'm older than Obama, just take Obama and Hillary, most of my life's all fair
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:54.000]  literally vampire potbelly god, I'm coming around, coming after us, my spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it go out, out, out
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  we're sick stuff, say the crowd, we don't even know to tell ourselves, rising up against us, millions of poor and in people of the very worst type and I'm so pissed
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  we're gonna stab your daughter at the mouth, we're gonna stab your wife herself, we're gonna stab you with a butcher knife, then the police chief is gonna say
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:42.000]  we love our mothers, we love our mothers, all is so good, all is so sweet
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:47:02.000]  right when I thought that the mainstream corporate media couldn't get any more, and that's the little end they put on the piece, and again, it's a train wreck because we've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these and then I've asked for them when I get them, I don't really have the name of who it is so I'm gonna wait a few weeks on the contest because it's just a log jam here
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  and then I'm gonna go through these again and try to promote a lot of them that are great, we're gonna play some of the really ridiculous ones as well, they're some of the best ones and just everybody who took action is a winner because resistance is victory
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:42.000]  the only way you do not succeed is laying down and going along with these people, and that's Danielle Pascal in the Philippines, and they're typing these as I look up on the screen, I don't have a teleprompter, they have a little note pad, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stop doing this now while I'm ahead and just say we'll tell you who those folks are later
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:46.000]  and we'll post it on infowars.com
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  now continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, they've made a big joke about caveman bone broth formula not tasting good, and they edited a video of where I was live on air talking about it months ago where I said it tastes okay in just water
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  but that when you put it in a blender with a bunch of milk that I thought it tasted like ovaltine, and I actually on the video go wow that tastes good, it just tastes passable without the milk
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  the next time I tested it with less milk and part water it just tasted okay but better than before, but it's not about how it tastes and I never said it was like you know better than mother's milk
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  and I said compared to other bone broth formulas it tastes really really good but that isn't the issue, the issue is it is from the biggest firm out there who also produces their own bone broth
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  and they've explained to us that we are now the number one seller of bone broth formulas in the United States which you Google bone broth being super popular, top health trend, but also the ancients knew about it, people know how great bone broth is
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:49:00.000]  so I'm going to cut some ads where I just show the scientific studies, the reports, the health reports, the cleanse reports, all of it
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  the bones are full of minerals, full of the stem cells, full of the trace elements, and as I said you can search into that, bone broth one of the most healing diet staples
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  that's out of Merkola, but instead of just leaving the chicken bones in with your chicken noodle soup when you cook it down, you know when you got the flu or got a cold grandma knew that was one of the best things for sustenance in every culture
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  it's the equivalent of, we haven't been able to quantify it, it's like servings like you know multiple chickens worth basically a bone broth concentrated then with turmeric, chaga, bee pollen and so much more
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  so again infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, part of the 1776 special, where a lot of the items are 1776 now in the month of August, we are running it with 30% off on strawberry flavor or chocolate flavor, nationally flavored

[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:35.000]  I did a lot of research on it before I ordered it because I've tried other products in the past and they haven't worked, but I could not believe the difference literally within a month
[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:45.000]  since I started taking it, I have lost 37 pounds, it was the belly fat, I could get weight off but I could never get the tummy off, now the tummy's coming off and I have more energy than I've had in 20 years

[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  and realize the fascination, the great connection of the universe to quote Rush in their great 1970s hit limelight that says it all
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  not the false elimination of the Hollywood lights but the real elimination of realizing we're part of a great compendium of God's mind
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:32.000]  it's an amazing time to be alive and that said, you know, they took a piece and edited it down and attacked me and tried to turn into something to hurt me
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  and it gave us all these new fans with leftist and others who are now following us listening and are being deprogrammed
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:46.000]  because being lectured all day by Brian Stelter is so boring, tune into this man, I'm a real maniac, this is real
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  and yeah, I talk to the president and yeah, I write him memos and yeah, we're taking the world back and yeah, we're kicking Al Gore's big ugly ass around the block
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:06.000]  we hate scammers and you want to fight, you got one, you're getting ready for some physical coup, fill your hand, Terry Blossoms
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  we're going to ram heads with you, we're crazier than you
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  God is like road war, I'm like the guy chained up in the front of the truck and they got to, you know, cut the change when it's time to go crazy
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:24.000]  we're livin' for this scum
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:28.000]  we're going to burn you politically to the ground, compende
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.000]  and if I get burned up in the midst of it, my fat will just be accelerant in the fight
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  but I don't have a death wish, you love death, that's why I'm throwing myself against you
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:44.000]  well, I sit here and I criticize Somalia where women are literal slaves, like Sudan
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  and our government overthrows a reformer of that area and then puts it back in place, what happened with Gaddafi
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  and you look at everything else, our government's allied with the bad guys
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  so I'm going to criticize when Somalis, there was a Sweden stand, car plows into crowded people outside Stockholm hospital
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  and of course they immediately go, not Islamic, not Islamic, even though it keeps turning out to be Islamic
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:14.000]  it's that the globalists are allied with the worst attributes of humanity to suppress them, to suppress us, to suppress everybody
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  and so we have to learn to discriminate against bad ideas, not against what color somebody's skin is
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  Martin Luther King said, go off the character of someone's deeds, they say at the universities everywhere
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  go off what race somebody is, it's the opposite of classical Thomas Jeffersonian liberalism
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:42.000]  and so that's what's happening and it's all unfolding everywhere
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  and so you've got cultures that are about blowing up every church and enslaving every women they run across
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:52.000]  being brought here by George Soros and other scum, we've got to speak out against it
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  not because we want to feel better than some Somali, not because we want to sit there and just hate someone
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:08.000]  because they're in a fallen evil death cult situation but we have to recognize when a grip of Somali pirates pulls up to rob you
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  or when culturally that's imported and promoted that that is an example of the globalists trying to kill the West
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:22.000]  and that's wrong and we have to stand against it and say no
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  and I use the Somali example because that is the most hellish backward place on earth except for maybe North Korea
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  am I criticizing Koreans because I make fun of Kim Jong-un and the nightmare culture they've got
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:38.000]  and they were trying to bring North Koreans here to promote that culture, I'd say what's your problem
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  it's not that I dislike Koreans and I'm not even going to play the race card on that one
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:47.000]  Korean, my family has saved Koreans, we'll be back

[03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:15.000]  We are on the march, the Empire is on the run
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:19.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  Earlier I was in a gestalt talking about all these different Islamic attacks with the person stabs people
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:35.000]  Or they run over folks in the car and scream Allah Akbar
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  And the media says, oh they said something in Arabic
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  It's not that Muslims themselves are even the enemy, it's that the globalists are using it to create a clash of civilizations
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  So they can get rid of our open western culture using our strength against us
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  How many times you see somebody run over with a car and it turns out it's Islamic and then they cover it up
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:01:02.000]  In Sweden they're now saying it was an elderly 80 year old lady that plowed into a crowd of people outside Stockholm Hospital
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  But what I'm getting at here is the globalists exploit these third world populations that are Islamic
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  They bring them in then they become kept groups controlled by the central government and that's admitted
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  And it's not being done to empower these groups, it's being done to again further balkanize the culture
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  Higher education professor lets stressed students pick their own grades
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  Because look, you're getting an education that's worthless in most cases
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  This is being done so you don't realize how you were sabotaged for the breakdown of our industrial society and the replacement of an automated robot system
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  The technocracy admits this plan, that's the thing, it's not my opinion, this is the admitted plan
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  University of Georgia professor allows students to choose their own grades to help alleviate stress
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:02:03.000]  2 plus 2 equals 5, Germany 1933, huge public university creates cultural appropriations prevention program just like Germany 1933
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  Don't dress like some supposed group and then on top of it it goes further
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  You can't have a job say in African studies if you're white or whatever, I mean this is really really dangerous
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  I should have spent the whole show on that
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  LA made 1.3 billion in illegal immigrant welfare payouts in just two years
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  That's an article out of Fox News, again just pointing out you don't go to Mexico or to Nigeria and have folks pay for the welfare
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  The number one immigrant for this country now is Chinese women coming here to have their babies for free
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:41.000]  Who become citizens and then get on the payroll
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:48.000]  And the big corporations want it because they want to bankrupt the country because they're offshore with their trillions and want to come in and exploit it
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  They're cold-blooded and they tell me and others, Alex why don't you just join us, the public doesn't care, they want to be slaves
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  Start exploiting them now, I won't do it
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  I could have bought prison stocks 20 years ago, they've basically tripled quadruples or more every decade but I wouldn't do it
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  But that doesn't mean I'm perfect, it doesn't mean that I don't make choices sometimes
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  I mean I've got iPhones because that's what I'm used to, it works good, I've been on max for 20 years
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  I know it's made in the worst slave factories out there, so I use it to fight that and to expose it and to say Apple, stop doing it
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000]  But Apple doesn't have to because they're liberal
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  We're liberal, we ain't work people to death, it's liberal
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  Mark Zuckerberg's taking Hawaiian lands, it's okay, he's Zuckerberg
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  It's alright, I'm Zuckerberg, dumb heifers, I'm here, I'm your god
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  Meanwhile, a year ago, Paul Watson is coming up, the next segment was pointing out that George Clooney owns multiple palaces
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:48.000]  Families, one of the richest families in Hollywood, and that he's an advertising bringing more migrants, more Islamists
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  But then he and his wife fled Europe saying it's too dangerous now
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:56.000]  Yeah bro, 10 million unwashed crazies
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  And I'm sure some of them are really nice people, but they're being rained down by the EU to break down culture in a weaponized program
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  It's incredible, Dutch Airlines pro-gay tweet backfires, Kit Daniels tweet reveals top-down conspiracy of social control
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:20.000]  The Royal Dutch Airlines tried to use seatbelts for a pro-LGBT message
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  But 4chan noticed only the heterosexual buckles fastened together correctly
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:34.000]  The tweet shows three belts with a top representing of a lesbian couple, the middle-of-gay couple, and the bottom of heterosexual couple
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:38.000]  But 4chan and Anons noticed the top two belts wouldn't fasten at all
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  But notice more than that subliminally, where's the heterosexual on the bottom?
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  Nothing against people that want to bump these together or these together or whatever
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  The point is these are meant to couple together and the globalists are targeting this to get rid of it because they want to reduce population
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:05:03.000]  This is who's being discriminated against, this is who's being targeted, this, this, the heterosexual operation, the earthlings, us
[03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  We'll be back with Paul Watson and the devastating McMaster News
[03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:42.000]  Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:46.000]  Today everything the government does at every level is concealed from us
[03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:51.000]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see
[03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:57.000]  Later in life Patrick Henry looked back and said when the American spirit was in its youth the language of America was different
[03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:03.000]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object. Today our primary concern is safety and comfort
[03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000]  When we should be demanding liberty
[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:28.000]  Renforwars.com, I'm David Knight

[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen we're into hour number four
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  I'm turning the baton over in mere minutes to Paul Joseph Watson known across the internet as PJW
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:50.000]  A big globalist think tank yesterday put out a huge study, I forgot to even get to this
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:09:00.000]  Showing algorithms and maps of who's the most popular on the web and who on Twitter is the biggest supporter of President Trump
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:08.000]  And that's how they're framing it, it's who is most related to supporting and sharing information of President Trump
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  Well it's the guy that said I'm officially off the Trump train when it came to foreign policy a few months ago
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  It's Paul Joseph Watson, we're only supporting Trump because he believes in what he's doing
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:23.000]  He's a good guy, he's fighting the globalist, does it mean his perspective is perfect according to ours?
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:26.000]  No, but he's really being the president
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  And of course it also showed Cernovich just as influential on Twitter as Paul Watson, amazing
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  And I was proud to get the blame, they said Jones gets the blame, he's causing all the hate
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  And then the international business time had a little tattletale article saying it's terrible
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  Jones hasn't been removed off the web for bullying a poor professor that said that
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:57.000]  You know, Roman England was black
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:06.000]  Again, we're not bashing black people, there's this total assault on white people meant to make us all go into racial groups and hate each other
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  It's Balkanization, the opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about, so there's all this to go over, but here's the big news
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  I wanted to get Paul's take on that he's taken over
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  Bombshell, exclusive intelligence agency caught McMaster briefing Soros on White House takeover
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  McMaster leaking intel to Soros almost daily says high level Israeli intelligence source directly to our source, Roger Stone
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:40.000]  And notice Cernovich is saying the exact same stuff, they've gone from saying we make stuff up to saying it's horrible, we've got the best intel
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  We even know we're McMasters eating, yes
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:52.000]  And my sources are not the Israelis I have sources in the White House obviously and in the military and some other places believe it at that
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  But the Israelis are grabbing publicly available stuff that this guy's putting out over the Wi-Fi at his house reportedly
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:08.000]  Just like Hillary's got a numb diploma, just like Loretta Lynch, he's got a coat name, a pen name he's using
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:18.000]  And oh by the way, Breitbart's breaking that they expunged records of him working with Soros, but then Google way back machine had it so they had to put it back
[03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  They had the Soros people pulling McMaster's name out everywhere
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  Man this gets better by the minute McMaster, McMaster Bader
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  So he's really trying to pull a wall over our eyes, I don't think it's working too well
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  What do you think's going on here Paul Watson, take over, we salute you
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:49.000]  Thanks Alex, yeah there's been a massive panic from the deep state apologist, the mainstream media, the fake news journalist, over the past probably week or even more now
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  And without the fact that we've been tweeting myself, Mike Cernovich, Jack Possovic and everyone else, hashtag Fire McMaster, now Jake Tapper came out today on the back of that bombshell exclusive that you just mentioned just before that came out
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  And basically had a pissy fit, he was triggered by the fact that Mike Flynn Jr, Mike Flynn's son was retweeting me and Cernovich on our hashtag Fire McMaster tweet
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  Which by the way Mike Flynn Jr has been retweeting us for probably well over a year now, that's not a story
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  Why is Jake Tapper, one of the most prominent people at CNN, panicked about the fact that he's retweeting us on Fire McMaster
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:36.000]  By the way, codename, codename Dompty Dompty
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:46.000]  Yeah, and by the way we're trying to get that to trend again on Twitter right now, which is always an uphill struggle Alex, because the demotion that stealth censorship is through the roof
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:57.000]  And that ties into something else Alex, and I'll get back to McMaster as well, but breaking as of 10 minutes ago, on the back of this huge scandal with Google
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:08.000]  The engineer coming out and putting out a memo saying basically conservatives are targeted for their opinion, they're discriminated against, men and women are biologically different and suited to different tasks
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  He actually voiced that thought crime Alex, and for that he was hounded, doxxed, fired by Google
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:19.000]  Well it's come out now in the past 20 minutes or so
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:32.000]  What we already knew, it's been confirmed, Google insiders have confirmed not only is Google demoting, i.e. changing their algorithms to push anti-PC content off their search results
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  Anti-Islamic terror content off their search results, not only is Google doing that, which we knew about from the election, where they would censor negative things about Hillary Clinton
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  When people typed in Hillary Clinton is a criminal, whatever, those results would come up on Bing, they would come up on Yahoo search
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  Nothing negative about Hillary would come up on Google, because they were in bed with the candidate
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:06.000]  And by the way, last week that top psychology professor said, no, there are men and women and people saying that they're a woman who says they're a man and then a man has a baby
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  You know, that's basically imaginary, he was banned off Google
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:28.000]  And by the way, I noticed now all this old medical stuff about mainstream science, mainstream news articles about vaccines hurting people, about fiber myalgia, about limes coming from Plum Island, which was declassified off the coast of New York
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:38.000]  It's all gone, they just shovel scientific reports at the top that are all in nomenclature, you can't understand, and only put a bunch of scientific reports that no one can read now
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:46.000]  And 50 pages deep, none of all the top links are there, so I mean Google is gone full censor, it is extinct in itself
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  I've always said we need to find an alternate, Paul, who do you think is still a half decent one that was as good as Google?
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  Because Google's not even good anymore, they're killing themselves, I mean I let them know I was going to sue them three weeks ago when they delisted us out of the first five pages
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  Suddenly we're all back at the top, so it's so political, I'm like I'm going to sue you for racketeering and civil rights violations and I've got the documents you hired people to delist me
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  Oh yes, let us put you right back at the top, but for everybody else, Google is moving against us, Paul, sorry, go ahead
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  Well what's also been confirmed Alex by this insider, which again I've been talking about for ages, they stop recommended videos by yours truly by other anti SJW people from appearing on recommended video lists
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  That is absolutely huge, because that's how you get most of your views on YouTube, even with like info wars driving views, it's still more on YouTube
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:54.000]  They did the super deluxe that got 20 million views on Facebook and on YouTube, they would make it not available or glitched it where the audio was off or just killed them
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  When they figured out, oh this attack, people like Alex, then they just stop that, Paul, they're in live time
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:10.000]  Look at this, Google Fires Diversity Manifesto author, James Damor, this is a confirmed high level insider, as you said, up on infowars.com
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:21.000]  It's amazing, Paul, I mean they're really, so what does this signify to you, that they're now Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of it is intensifying censorship
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:28.000]  50 times what it ever was, fake news is intensifying their lives about Trump, about us, CNN saying the economy is horrible
[03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:38.000]  I mean these people are next level liars, does it signify they're getting ready to move with something big, because they're saying they're getting ready to kill the president
[03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:46.000]  Oh totally, I mean the hysteria is through the roof, yeah, people were thinking it would tail off, you know after Trump was in office for six, seven, eight months
[03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:55.000]  No way, as a result of this Google scandal, they're now talking about creating black lists of anyone with conservative opinions, but not even just conservative opinions
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:17:04.000]  If you disagree with their claim that they're on any differences biologically between men and women, you're a thought criminal, you're an alt-right neo-Nazi
[03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:14.000]  And you're not allowed to have a decent paying job, they're literally calling for that off the back of this Google engineer going public and being fired for his hate crime
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:22.000]  I mean read what he said, he put out a 10 page memo, Alex, and it's dry, it's anodyne, it's not even that offensive
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  But the mere fact that he was a conservative within Google, they had to shame him, they publicly shamed him, they doxxed him, they hounded him, they fired him
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:41.000]  Now they're going to face a lawsuit from him, and again it just gets to the heart of the matter, which is no tolerance for diversity of opinion within Google whatsoever
[03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:50.000]  So if they're doing that on the inside, of course they're going to do it on the outside, and this whistleblower, another whistleblower, we've got more coming out today
[03:17:50.000 --> 03:18:01.000]  Is saying that they had a complete hissy fit after the election, hysteria was rampant, and that's when they decided to ramp up that stealth censorship, which is why now
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:10.000]  Whenever I upload a YouTube video, Alex, and this is happening to a bunch of different uploaders, not only conservatives, people with an opinion, anyone
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:21.000]  They delete hundreds of subscribers every time you upload a video, now my traction was so good over the past six months that I still managed to get past a million subscribers
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:30.000]  Paul, let's explain how they're doing this, let's explain how they're doing this, and I'm skipping this break so you have more time, and the 50 break, because this is the fourth hour, and the network doesn't even seem like this is an important hour
[03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:36.000]  Even though it has hundreds of stations, and so that's fine, we skipped a lot of the breaks here, because they haven't even ever monetized it, that's fine
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:49.000]  But Paul, if you look at this, first they cut your funding off the channel that made some money, 76% as soon as Trump got elected, they did that to all my channels, and of course your channel is my channel
[03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:59.000]  So that's 76% cutting and funding just on our YouTube platform, now we always just grow more tentacles and get more support like a Hydra, our listeners understand this
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:08.000]  But see, now they're going to block everything, and people keep saying, well why are you on YouTube? Because it's the big dominant platform like Facebook because we're winning despite the censorship
[03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  It's the battlefield, while we get people to go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, and while we get denial of service attacks and hack attacks and attempts to get rid of our sponsors and our suppliers and attempts to sabotage us
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:35.000]  Yes, we know folks, we know, Drudge is right, we should have our own things, not their electronic ghetto, but we have to go into the ghettos of Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and let folks know they're becoming classical ghettos
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:43.000]  For folks that don't know, in Nazi Germany, the first thing they would do was say, you can't have a business, then they'd move you into a ghetto, then they start shutting you down
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  This is what they're doing, and we've got to have President Trump come after them, break them up for antitrust
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:57.000]  The fact that they've noticed that Trump doesn't understand how this works, he knows they're fake news, he knows they're bad, but they're censoring him, they're blocking him
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:20:06.000]  And we're getting memos of the President, he's looking into it, but all of his adjuncts, except for Scaramucci, go no sir, that's not happening, and lie to him
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:16.000]  Because they believe the power of Google will break the President, they're such damn cowards, if he just had a hundred people around him that weren't cowardly traders, we would win easily, Paul
[03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:25.000]  Go ahead, instead we're going into a total AI, technocracy takeover nightmare, the left doesn't get once our free speech is gone, theirs is gone too
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  They're the useful idiots on the left, there's no such thing as a left with Al Gore and George Soros
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:42.000]  These people are international crime lords, you morons, I'm turning it over to you, but I'm going to show this one article that Cernovich sent me from the enemy, showing how you're the top enemy, go ahead
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:49.000]  No, I mean as people say, oh why don't you just start your own video platform, it would be an echo chamber
[03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  I didn't, it cost us 50,000 a month in bandwidth, info1.com forward slash show, sorry go ahead
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:07.000]  We actually want intellectual diversity, we want diversity of opinion, which is why we want to interact with people with different ideas, you know, because we're actually classical liberals
[03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:14.000]  Unlike Google, which wants to stealth censorship everybody and then claim they're the public commons, that they're going to give everybody a voice
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:25.000]  Google's there to shut up about the execution vans in China and murder operations and whenever they have a massacre of Africans for their land, Google covers it up, the New York Times says it's okay
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:39.000]  They're evil, hardcore, scientific psychopaths posing as liberals, the little pink outfits and the funny colored socks and the little moustaches are meant to be non-threatening, they're savage murderers, go ahead
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  And the censorship is coming, Alex, because both Vice and the New York Times, far from, you know, alt-right publications, admitted separately that the right is dominating YouTube and by the right it's just anyone who's authentic who has any sense of rationality and common sense remaining
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:08.000]  So they freaked out, we're completely dominating YouTube in terms of politics, there's no competition, all the SJW channels fail, a lot of the big SJWs can't even talk
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:13.000]  The SJWs just literally go, they can't talk
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:16.000]  Like they're in a body snatcher movie
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:28.000]  No, I mean, that is part of it, Alex, they're lazy, they're unchained, they don't spend 10 hours starting from the computer editing the YouTube videos, they can just put out a tweet and virtue signal and it's easier
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:43.000]  But again, New York Times, Vice admits the right is dominating YouTube, they're freaking out about it, so now they're just gonna censor us, they're deleting hundreds of subscribers, the views have plummeted since April since the apocalypse, so it's not just about the money
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:50.000]  Independent creators are gonna get absolutely crushed and be demotivated from making videos in the first place
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:58.000]  By the way, what's the name of the video? Because they all do it where the woman goes like body snatcher, because we've noticed that's the standard deal but she's the best
[03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:02.000]  It's on a show folks, I'm not joking
[03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:13.000]  No, exactly, I mean, let's look at a segment from this memo that this Google engineer was fired for, was vilified for, was called a misogynist and a racist
[03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:27.000]  This is what he concluded with, he said suggestions, I hope it's clear that I'm not saying that diversity is bad, that Google or society is 100% fair, that we shouldn't try to correct existing biases or that minorities have the same experience as those in the majority
[03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:34.000]  My larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don't fit a certain ideology
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:43.000]  So it's completely milk toast, he's saying oh we shouldn't treat conservatives like crap and shame them into silence and not allow them to think that they have
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:46.000]  Hold on, let's be fair though, under fair use
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  Hold on, under the fairness doctrine they're bringing back, let's give equal time the other side, let's play a popular standard SJW for a moment, let's play and give some equal time, let's let her communicate both verbally and non-verbally, here it is
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:02.000]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites, is it contagious?
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:04.000]  They're like real homies
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:06.000]  It looked right after you, you need to get out
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:08.000]  You're looking at it as if it was human or not human
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:14.000]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow
[03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:16.000]  We're being cornered
[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:19.000]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  Ibarricating Street
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  Invasion of the body-sadges
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:45.000]  The land of the walking dead
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  If you are receiving this call, I'm going to let you take over, it's hard to get Paul to host a couple days a week and then I always take over because I like Paul so much
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:59.000]  He works so hard, he's hard to get old up, but if you're not a TV viewer, we actually show body snatchers versus what they really act like in public
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.000]  And finally I think I went crazy today
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  This is entertaining, we're in a dystopic badass movie, man
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:09.000]  I'm actually starting to enjoy this, Paul, I'm going to go watch the rest of the show, bye
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  Oh, here's that one part, alt-right open intelligence initiative, have you seen this with the map, how you're the big enemy?
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  Have you seen it?
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:19.000]  Yeah, that was an interesting read, Alex
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:22.000]  Have you seen the map?
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:29.000]  They're freaking out about it, Jake Tapper's saying, oh, why is Mike Flynn Jr. retweeting these far-right fringe people?
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:31.000]  If we're so fringe
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:33.000]  Jake Tapper?
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  Yeah, why is he so triggered by it?
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:40.000]  He's triggered, it's like when media matters gets triggered by drudge linking to us, remember that?
[03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  He literally wrote an article about it every time, years ago
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:49.000]  If we're so fringe, if we're so out there, why are you even talking about it as well?
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  Why are they mapping everything we do because we have way more viewers than they do
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  And they're totally freaked out and want to shut us down like any group of losers do
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:59.000]  Can you show this article?
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:03.000]  Like Julian Assange said, censorship is for losers
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  But again, we're Trump's base, that's the whole point
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:10.000]  I mean, where the reason why he got elected, right, mainly
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:13.000]  And everybody else who got on board the bandwagon as well
[03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:19.000]  They know that, and yet they still can't resist calling us alt-right, far-right, fringe
[03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  Again, we're not the fringe, we're the base
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000]  That's why we've got such a massive influence
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  And that's why Jake Tapper of CNN is so triggered by it
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:29.000]  But why do they scream and yell when their tongues hang out?
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:33.000]  Because we're seeing this everywhere now where they just go
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:40.000]  I mean, everywhere I go there's like
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:43.000]  I mean, what happened?
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  It's called Trump derangement syndrome, Alex
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:49.000]  And it's been legitimized by the mainstream media saying that he's literally Hitler
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:52.000]  Why don't you feed the trolls and do an invitation of it?
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:54.000]  Feed the trolls and do an invitation of it
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:56.000]  Let's go back to Paul here
[03:26:56.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  Go back to Paul, feed the trolls, do it for them
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  They're doing it again, they cut, don't cut
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:12.000]  Do it again
[03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:15.000]  It's like a baby throwing a fit
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:18.000]  No, these are the people working for Google now, Alex
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:20.000]  These are the sober rational voices
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:23.000]  I mean, you should have seen the tweets that they said about this guy
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:26.000]  Remember reality winner with a top secret clearance
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:29.000]  Giving information to ISIS and hating all white people
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000]  And she was a dumb white lady?
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  These are crazy people
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:38.000]  No, they've been driven completely mad because they think they have the moral high ground
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:42.000]  Because for the past 8, 10 months the media has told them
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:44.000]  That they're the resistance
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:48.000]  I mean, Michael Moore is now talking about going after Trump's kids and saying
[03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  You won't get put in prison if you just turn over your father
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:54.000]  Absolute complete insanity
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  These people are just getting more and more hysterical of where the extreme is fringe
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:03.000]  Absolutely insane, you've seen how they react in public
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:07.000]  And this Google thing is blowing up in their face once again
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:08.000]  They tried to come out
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:11.000]  Now you've got fake news coming out and saying
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:17.000]  This is CNN, the Google engineer who wrote a memo that argued women aren't biologically fit for tech jobs
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:18.000]  Complete lie
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:19.000]  He didn't say that
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:20.000]  He hasn't even said that
[03:28:20.000 --> 03:28:25.000]  He said people should be selected for jobs based on their talent
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:29.000]  Based on their past experience if they're suited for the job
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  My God, what a thought crime
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  You should pick people for a job based on who's best at the frigging job, Alex
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:40.000]  By the way, we're trying to hire more women because I think women do a great job
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:45.000]  We're putting ads out for women for some reason they just don't apply as much
[03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:48.000]  Listen to what you said in this memo
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  Men tend to occupy, this is paraphrasing, men tend to occupy more leadership positions
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:57.000]  Because they're under more pressure to be status driven
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:59.000]  Okay, that's just a fact
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:02.000]  We've had a bunch of scientists came out today and backed him up
[03:29:02.000 --> 03:29:07.000]  Why do you think 80% of Google's technical staff are men?
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:10.000]  Because men are more attracted towards those kind of jobs
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:12.000]  Doesn't mean that men are better than women
[03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:13.000]  They're just
[03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:14.000]  Here's an example
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:17.000]  I did this weekend, I said no electronics
[03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:21.000]  So my daughters got every chair in the house built a giant fort
[03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:24.000]  And began going in the kitchen and cooking things
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:27.000]  It was all biological, it was all epigenic
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:30.000]  And then my son is like, let's get guns out and clean them in bows and arrows
[03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:32.000]  And write a screenplay
[03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:33.000]  It's not that women don't write screenplays
[03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:38.000]  It's that epigenetically the men start going around and organizing weapons and stuff
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:40.000]  Because the tribe over the hill might come after us
[03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:44.000]  And the women are like building forts and things and cooking food
[03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:48.000]  It's genetic, it doesn't mean women can't do things just as good as men in many cases
[03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:49.000]  Or vice versa
[03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:50.000]  But we can't have babies
[03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:55.000]  I told Paul I was going away, but Paul is now taking over after this quick break
[03:29:55.000 --> 03:30:24.000]  Stay with us
[03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:27.000]  The question is, how do we contain it?
[03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:32.000]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:34.000]  That is the ultimate concern
[03:30:34.000 --> 03:30:40.000]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country
[03:30:40.000 --> 03:30:43.000]  It was why the anti-fiddleists opposed the Constitution
[03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:47.000]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power
[03:30:47.000 --> 03:30:52.000]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance
[03:30:52.000 --> 03:30:57.000]  Those who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives
[03:30:57.000 --> 03:31:02.000]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are
[03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:06.000]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions
[03:31:06.000 --> 03:31:08.000]  FriendForWars.com, I'm David Knight
[03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:10.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter
[03:31:10.000 --> 03:31:12.000]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned
[03:31:12.000 --> 03:31:15.000]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children
[03:31:15.000 --> 03:31:21.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems
[03:31:21.000 --> 03:31:27.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems
[03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:30.000]  Have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze
[03:31:30.000 --> 03:31:35.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children
[03:31:35.000 --> 03:31:37.000]  To the best job you can to purify your air
[03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:40.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:45.000]  While themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves
[03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:47.000]  The general public doesn't
[03:31:47.000 --> 03:31:52.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500
[03:31:52.000 --> 03:31:56.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean
[03:31:56.000 --> 03:31:58.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house
[03:31:58.000 --> 03:32:02.000]  Replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job
[03:32:02.000 --> 03:32:05.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:08.000]  And in FullWarStore.com
[03:32:08.000 --> 03:32:13.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information
[03:32:13.000 --> 03:32:17.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research
[03:32:17.000 --> 03:32:21.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:26.000]  That our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:33.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing
[03:32:33.000 --> 03:32:35.000]  And so I set out to develop Caveman
[03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:39.000]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken
[03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:46.000]  There are seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time
[03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:50.000]  Info Wars isn't just fighting the globalist, we're getting results

[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:54.000]  When I came in at the top of the hour
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:56.000]  This article out of Breitbart
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:35:58.000]  Which is breaking within the last hour
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:00.000]  Former Google employee
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:02.000]  There are efforts to demo anything
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:05.000]  Non-PC from search results
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:07.000]  Now we knew this was being tested
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:09.000]  During the presidential election
[03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  Because of course the negative search
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:14.000]  Terms search queries for Hillary Clinton
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:16.000]  Were not showing up on Google
[03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  The same way they were showing up on
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:21.000]  For example Bing or Yahoo search
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:24.000]  People would type in Hillary Clinton is
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:27.000]  And on Bing or Yahoo or any other search engine
[03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:30.000]  Negative results would be suggested
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:33.000]  In the auto complete suggestion feature
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:36.000]  So you know it would be Hillary Clinton is a criminal
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:37.000]  Or whatever
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:39.000]  You type the same thing onto Google
[03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  And you got a different set of suggestions
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000]  None of which were negative
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:46.000]  That was a clear example of them
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:48.000]  Gaming their algorithm for the benefit
[03:36:48.000 --> 03:36:49.000]  Of Hillary Clinton
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:51.000]  Of course we know Eric Schmidt
[03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:52.000]  Was in bed with Obama
[03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:54.000]  Was in bed with Hillary Clinton
[03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:56.000]  Now this which is what we've been talking about
[03:36:56.000 --> 03:36:58.000]  Here for weeks
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:01.000]  Breitbart found a former Google engineer
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:04.000]  Or whistleblower they called him Emmett
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:06.000]  They asked him if he could corroborate
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:08.000]  Allegations that employees within
[03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  Google's ad sales department
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:12.000]  Have expressed a great deal of sympathy
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  With the sleeping giants campaign
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:17.000]  Which are sought to deny ad revenue
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:19.000]  To alternative media sites
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:22.000]  Including Breitbart news and rebel media
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:24.000]  Of course InvoWars has had its own problems
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  With ad revenue sites as well
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:29.000]  According to Breitbart's anonymous source
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:31.000]  Some ad sales employees are quote
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:34.000]  Openly encouraging ad words customers
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:37.000]  To pull their ads from Breitbart and rebel media
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:39.000]  So there's the financial aspect
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:42.000]  Trying to strangle
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:45.000]  The financial base of alternative media websites
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:47.000]  At the source by preventing them
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  From being successful with Google ads
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:52.000]  We saw the adpocalypse back in April
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:54.000]  Well literally as Alex said
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:57.000]  We lost 76% of our revenue
[03:37:57.000 --> 03:38:00.000]  From videos on YouTube
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:02.000]  Now for us we can just about swallow it
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:04.000]  Because our audience is so brilliant
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:06.000]  In supporting us and buying the products
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:08.000]  To make up for that shortfall
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  That's going to kill independent creators
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:12.000]  That's going to put them off creating
[03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  YouTube videos it disincentivizes it
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:17.000]  Because they don't have the time to create them
[03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:19.000]  Because they have to get other jobs
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:21.000]  Because it's not enough to pay their way
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:24.000]  And that's exactly what we're seeing now
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  Because as I said the New York Times
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:28.000]  Vice and others have admitted
[03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:31.000]  That the right conservatives
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  Reality based communities
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:36.000]  Anti-SJW content producers
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:39.000]  Are completely dominating YouTube
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:41.000]  Have been for the past what
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:43.000]  18 months at least
[03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:45.000]  It took a long time
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:47.000]  For YouTube of course owned by Google
[03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:49.000]  To finally realize that
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:52.000]  Now they're clamping down
[03:38:52.000 --> 03:38:54.000]  The article goes on
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:56.000]  Emmett concurred with our source quote
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:38:59.000]  A number of friends have privately confirmed this to me
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  I know listen to this I know there are efforts
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:04.000]  To demo anything non-PC
[03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:08.000]  Anti-communist and anti-Islamic terror
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:11.000]  From Google search results
[03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:14.000]  Because we can't have people being anti-Islamic terror
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:16.000]  Can we God forbid
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:19.000]  To what extent that has been successful I don't know
[03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:23.000]  So they're actually demoting in the algorithm
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:25.000]  Alternative media websites
[03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:28.000]  That have a different opinion
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:30.000]  On Islamic terrorism
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  On communism on anything quote non-PC
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:36.000]  Google is basically the internet at this point
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:38.000]  They've got a huge monopoly on search results
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:40.000]  They control the flow of information
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:43.000]  They are the ministry of truth
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:45.000]  So if they decide
[03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  That the marketplace of ideas just goes out the window
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:50.000]  And they selectively choose
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  What appears at the top of search results
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:54.000]  It's not organic it's contrived
[03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  Then of course they can control reality
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:00.000]  It's all about power
[03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:03.000]  Emmett says he personally witnessed efforts
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:06.000]  From leftists within Google to bias
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:10.000]  YouTube's algorithms to push anti-PC content
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  Off the platform's related videos recommendations
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:17.000]  What have I been talking about for weeks on end
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:21.000]  For months on end since the ad apocalypse
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:25.000]  First they eviscerated people's income
[03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:27.000]  By paying them less for the ads
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:29.000]  By the ads not even appearing on a lot of videos
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:31.000]  Demonetizing videos
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:36.000]  Now they're preventing anti-PC videos
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  From turning up on the recommended list
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:41.000]  Of YouTube.com
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:44.000]  Which is huge because that's where most of the traffic
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:46.000]  That's where most of the views come from
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:49.000]  So they're gaming their own algorithm
[03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:52.000]  To bury to censor that content
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:56.000]  Now Facebook got caught last year
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:40:58.000]  Gaming their trending section
[03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:02.000]  To bury conservative friendly trending topics
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:04.000]  That was a huge scandal
[03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:06.000]  They had to put on a whole show
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:09.000]  Of inviting conservatives to meet with them
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:11.000]  Who were basically most of them cook services
[03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:13.000]  People like Glenn Beck
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:14.000]  They had to apologize
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:16.000]  They had to at least promise
[03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  At least promise to try and change that
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:21.000]  Get rid of that bias
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:24.000]  So that trending section on Facebook is organic
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:26.000]  Is curated in a way
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:29.000]  That doesn't deliberately bury conservative friendly topics
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:31.000]  Now we know for a fact
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  It's happening on YouTube
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:35.000]  The subscribers are dropping off
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:38.000]  They delete hundreds of subscribers
[03:41:38.000 --> 03:41:40.000]  Whenever you upload a video
[03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:42.000]  Oh and by the way, people like the young Turks
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:44.000]  Just by strange coincidence
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:46.000]  Don't have that problem
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:48.000]  They don't have the problem where
[03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:51.000]  Subscribers to YouTube channels aren't being notified
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  When you upload a new video
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  Again is where a great proportion of the views come from
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:41:59.000]  People say, why don't you just start your own video network
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:01.000]  Why don't you just put it on your own website
[03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:04.000]  Because that's not a solution
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:06.000]  You're preaching to the choir
[03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:08.000]  It's an echo chamber
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  You're not reaching people who otherwise
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:12.000]  Wouldn't see your material
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:14.000]  Why do you think Generation Z
[03:42:14.000 --> 03:42:16.000]  Is the most conservative since World War II
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:18.000]  Why do you think I get messages
[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:21.000]  Or at least I used to before all this
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:23.000]  From teenagers
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  Literally from 15, 16 year olds
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:27.000]  Who say they were social justice warriors
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  They were far leftists
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:31.000]  They saw my videos
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:33.000]  They saw videos by other similar creators on YouTube
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:35.000]  It completely flipped their perspective
[03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:37.000]  Now they're young conservatives
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  And will be forever
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:41.000]  Because once you've taken a red pill
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:43.000]  You ain't going back
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:45.000]  I can't tell you how many hundreds
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:47.000]  Or thousands of messages I've read that have said that
[03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:49.000]  From very young people
[03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:51.000]  You know, geriatrics who watch Fox News
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  Because they can't be bothered
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:55.000]  To get up and turn the TV off
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:57.000]  You know, their average viewer is what
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:42:59.000]  Age 74 or something
[03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:01.000]  We're talking about young people
[03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:03.000]  Who are the future of the country
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:05.000]  Future huge voting blocks
[03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:07.000]  Being red-pilled by YouTube videos
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  Because that's what they watch
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:11.000]  They don't watch television
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:13.000]  They watch YouTube
[03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:15.000]  Well now they're doing something about it
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:17.000]  YouTube is going to make sure
[03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:19.000]  They don't see those videos
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  Because they're not going to pop up
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:23.000]  Which of course benefits the social justice warriors
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:25.000]  Most of whom have quit
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:27.000]  Because their YouTube's are so horrifically down-voted
[03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:29.000]  Lambasted and ridiculed
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:31.000]  They're going to come back
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:33.000]  Because they're going to be favored by the algorithm
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:35.000]  It's insidious
[03:43:35.000 --> 03:43:37.000]  It's stealth censorship
[03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:39.000]  And now it's being exposed
[03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:41.000]  As a result of this scandal
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:43.000]  Relating to a Google engineer
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:45.000]  Who came out and basically put out a 10 page memo
[03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:47.000]  Which wasn't even
[03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:49.000]  Extreme
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:51.000]  By any stretch of the imagination
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:53.000]  In fact let's get into that right now
[03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:55.000]  Zero hedge reports
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  I have a right to express my concerns
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:01.000]  Fired Google engineer will pursue legal action
[03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:03.000]  The computer engineer fired by Google
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:05.000]  For writing a memo
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:07.000]  In which he slammed the company's anti-conservative culture
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  And said women are less suited
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:11.000]  To certain roles in tech and leadership
[03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:13.000]  God forbid he commit that thought crime
[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:15.000]  Of saying men and women are different
[03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:17.000]  Is considering taking legal action
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:19.000]  Against the company
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:21.000]  So again they go through it
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  And I'll go through a few things he said
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  In this memo because obviously it's 10 pages long
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.000]  It's 3300 words
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:29.000]  I'm not going to read it out all on air
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:31.000]  But he said women and men
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:33.000]  Are biologically different
[03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:35.000]  And have different skillsets suited to different tasks
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:37.000]  That's a thought crime
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:39.000]  You can't say that
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  Even though Google hires 80%
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:43.000]  Men to work on its technical side
[03:44:43.000 --> 03:44:45.000]  And why is that?
[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:47.000]  Because men are more prone, more suited
[03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:49.000]  More attracted to technical jobs
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:51.000]  Doesn't mean they're better
[03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:53.000]  That's not misogyny
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:55.000]  That's just biological difference
[03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  Deal with it
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:59.000]  He also said men tend to occupy
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:01.000]  More leadership positions
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:03.000]  Because they are under more pressure
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:05.000]  To be status driven
[03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  Another fact based on biology
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:09.000]  I'll get into some of the scientists
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:11.000]  On that in a minute
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:13.000]  He also said companies like Google
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:15.000]  Discriminate against conservatives
[03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:17.000]  Because of their political views
[03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:19.000]  And lo and behold immediately after this blew up
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:21.000]  Now we have conservatives
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:23.000]  Within Google, former engineers
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:25.000]  Current engineers saying exactly
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:27.000]  That
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:29.000]  He also said Google set up
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  A politically correct monoculture
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:33.000]  In order to enforce an ideological
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:35.000]  Echo chamber that shames
[03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:37.000]  Descenters into silence
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:39.000]  He also said
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:41.000]  And wait for it
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:43.000]  This is pretty racist, this is pretty sexist
[03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:45.000]  This is pretty extreme
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:47.000]  Basically this is hate speech
[03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  He said people should be treated
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:51.000]  As individuals
[03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:53.000]  Yes, he actually said that
[03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:55.000]  And for that he was
[03:45:55.000 --> 03:45:57.000]  Villified, demonized
[03:45:57.000 --> 03:45:59.000]  Doxxed, unmasked
[03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:01.000]  Hunted down and fired
[03:46:01.000 --> 03:46:03.000]  Within three days
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:05.000]  Of putting out this memo
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:07.000]  As the verified libtard mob outrage
[03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:09.000]  Called for his head
[03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:11.000]  And his head rolled
[03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:13.000]  Oh but they're tolerant progressives
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  They're tolerant progressives
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:17.000]  Who love diversity
[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:19.000]  Apart from diversity of opinion
[03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  In which case they will hound you
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:23.000]  They will witch hunt you
[03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:25.000]  They will shame you
[03:46:25.000 --> 03:46:27.000]  They will cast you aside
[03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:29.000]  So James
[03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:31.000]  Daymore has been exposed to his egregious
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:33.000]  Thought crimes
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:35.000]  Now it's just snowballing
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:37.000]  This is going to be a huge blowback for Google
[03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:39.000]  It's going to be absolutely cataclysmic
[03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  For their reputation
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:43.000]  Because people are sick of this
[03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:45.000]  This is why Trump won
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:47.000]  This is why the right
[03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:49.000]  Is dominating YouTube
[03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:51.000]  This is why the right is dominating
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:53.000]  Political discourse
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:55.000]  This is why the left has two censors
[03:46:55.000 --> 03:46:57.000]  Because they can't compete
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:46:59.000]  On a level playing field
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:01.000]  In the marketplace of ideas
[03:47:01.000 --> 03:47:03.000]  And arguments
[03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:05.000]  Because they can't make arguments
[03:47:05.000 --> 03:47:07.000]  They're completely incapable of doing so
[03:47:07.000 --> 03:47:09.000]  Because for the past 10
[03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:11.000]  15 years
[03:47:11.000 --> 03:47:13.000]  They've relied on calling people racist
[03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:15.000]  And shutting them down
[03:47:15.000 --> 03:47:17.000]  That's it
[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:19.000]  If you don't develop
[03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:21.000]  If you don't maintain
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:23.000]  If you don't strengthen arguments
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:25.000]  You lose the ability to make them
[03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:27.000]  And you have to resort to censorship
[03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:29.000]  The progressives are the new regressives
[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:31.000]  That
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:33.000]  Let's get to what the scientists said
[03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:35.000]  Because of course he committed a thought crime
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:37.000]  By saying men and women are different
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:39.000]  You can't say that anymore
[03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:41.000]  Meanwhile they're literally sending
[03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:43.000]  Like four-year-old kids to transgender camps
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:45.000]  And that's progressive, that's cool
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:47.000]  But this is a headline from Breitbart
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:49.000]  Psychologists claim
[03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:51.000]  Google viewpoint diversity manifesto
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  Is scientifically accurate
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:55.000]  Listen to what they said
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  Four scientists have claimed
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  Google manifesto is scientifically accurate
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:01.000]  Responding to the viewpoint
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  Diversity manifesto
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:05.000]  Which called for more ideological diversity
[03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  In Google's workplace and pointed out
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:09.000]  Not only the biological differences
[03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:11.000]  Between men and women
[03:48:11.000 --> 03:48:13.000]  But also how these can apply to work
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:15.000]  The four scientists deemed the 10-page document
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:17.000]  To be scientifically accurate
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:19.000]  This is what they said
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:23.000]  Deborah W. So, PhD
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:25.000]  A Canadian science writer
[03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:27.000]  Deemed the manifesto to be scientifically accurate
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:29.000]  Declaring as a woman
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:31.000]  Who's worked in academia
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:33.000]  And within STEM
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:35.000]  I didn't find the memo offensive or sexist
[03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:37.000]  In the least
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:39.000]  She says I found it to be a well-thought-out document
[03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:41.000]  Asking for greater tolerance for differences in opinion
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:43.000]  And treating people as individuals
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:45.000]  Instead of
[03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:47.000]  Based on group membership
[03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:49.000]  Within the field of neuroscience
[03:48:49.000 --> 03:48:51.000]  Sex differences between women
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:53.000]  And men when it comes to brain structure
[03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:55.000]  And function
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  And associated differences in personality
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:48:59.000]  And occupational preferences
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:01.000]  Are understood to be true
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  Facts don't care about your feelings
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:07.000]  This is mainstream science
[03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:09.000]  Because the evidence for them, she continues
[03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  Thousands of studies
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:13.000]  Is strong
[03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:15.000]  This is not information that's considered controversial
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:17.000]  Or up for debate
[03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:19.000]  If you tried to argue otherwise
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  Or for purely social influences
[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:23.000]  You'd laugh at
[03:49:23.000 --> 03:49:25.000]  But the left can't have that, can they?
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:27.000]  Because of this insane, deranged
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:29.000]  Cult-like conspiracy theory
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:31.000]  That everything's a social construct
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:33.000]  No, everything's not a social construct
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:35.000]  Men can't get pregnant
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:37.000]  No matter how many stupid headlines
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:39.000]  You come out saying
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:41.000]  Man gets pregnant
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:43.000]  It's not a man
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:45.000]  Let's listen to what other scientists said
[03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  Professor David P. Schmidt
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:49.000]  I think it's really important
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:51.000]  To discuss this topic scientifically
[03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:53.000]  Keeping an open mind
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:55.000]  And using informed skepticism
[03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:57.000]  When evaluating claims about evidence
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:49:59.000]  In the case of personality traits
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:01.000]  Evidence that men and women
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  May have different average levels
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:05.000]  Of certain traits
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:07.000]  Is rather strong
[03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:09.000]  I made a whole video about this
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:11.000]  I had an argument with a feminist
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:13.000]  Who claimed that
[03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  Men were only better than women
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:17.000]  At most sports
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:19.000]  Because of society
[03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:21.000]  Because it was a social construct
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:23.000]  No, complete BS
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:25.000]  Men have greater muscle mass
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:27.000]  They have greater bone mass
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:29.000]  Again, doesn't mean they're better than women
[03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  Just means they're better than women at some things
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  Women are better than men at others
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:35.000]  Why is that a thought crime to say?
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:39.000]  So again
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:41.000]  The professional Australian women's soccer team
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  Highly trained
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  Played a team of 15-year-old boys
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:47.000]  Okay, who won?
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:49.000]  The 15-year-old boys won 7-0
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:53.000]  Men are better than women at some sports
[03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:55.000]  Because they have greater bone density
[03:50:57.000 --> 03:50:59.000]  Because they have greater muscle mass
[03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:01.000]  Men and women are biologically different
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  That's a scientific fact
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:05.000]  Deal with it
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:07.000]  We're going to skip this break by the way
[03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:09.000]  Absolutely insane
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:11.000]  The left is at war with reality
[03:51:11.000 --> 03:51:13.000]  And now they're saying
[03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:15.000]  People who don't believe this
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:17.000]  Cult-like mentality
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:19.000]  This deranged set of beliefs
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:21.000]  About everything being a social construct
[03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:23.000]  Maybe we should target them
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:25.000]  Maybe we should prevent them
[03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  From being employed in the first place
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:29.000]  I've actually seen tweets
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:31.000]  From prominent people saying
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:33.000]  Let's just create blacklists of people
[03:51:33.000 --> 03:51:35.000]  Who we deem to have conservative opinions
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:37.000]  And prevent them from being hired
[03:51:37.000 --> 03:51:39.000]  By any company in the future
[03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:41.000]  This is the ideological purge
[03:51:41.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  This is the summit
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:45.000]  Of Trump derangement syndrome
[03:51:45.000 --> 03:51:47.000]  This is the hysteria that has been born
[03:51:47.000 --> 03:51:49.000]  As a result
[03:51:49.000 --> 03:51:51.000]  Of their rampant but hurt
[03:51:51.000 --> 03:51:53.000]  Absolutely incredible
[03:51:55.000 --> 03:51:57.000]  Let's see what some of the other scientists said
[03:51:57.000 --> 03:51:59.000]  About James Damor
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:01.000]  And his
[03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:03.000]  Temerity in claiming that men and women
[03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:05.000]  Are biologically different
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:07.000]  This is again out of Breitbart
[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:09.000]  It's a Quillette study
[03:52:09.000 --> 03:52:11.000]  Or survey of scientists
[03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:13.000]  The author of the Google essay
[03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:15.000]  On issues related to diversity
[03:52:15.000 --> 03:52:17.000]  Gets nearly all of the science
[03:52:17.000 --> 03:52:19.000]  And its implications exactly right
[03:52:19.000 --> 03:52:21.000]  Declared Rutgers University
[03:52:21.000 --> 03:52:23.000]  Professor Lee Justin
[03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:25.000]  He says its main points are that
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:27.000]  One, neither the left nor the right
[03:52:27.000 --> 03:52:29.000]  Gets diversity completely right
[03:52:29.000 --> 03:52:31.000]  And two, the social science evidence
[03:52:31.000 --> 03:52:33.000]  On implicit and explicit bias
[03:52:33.000 --> 03:52:35.000]  Has been wildly oversold and is far weaker
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:37.000]  Than most people seem to realise
[03:52:37.000 --> 03:52:39.000]  Three, Google has perhaps unintentionally
[03:52:39.000 --> 03:52:41.000]  Yeah right
[03:52:41.000 --> 03:52:43.000]  Created an authoritarian atmosphere
[03:52:43.000 --> 03:52:45.000]  That has stifled discussion of these issues
[03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:47.000]  By stigmatising anyone
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:49.000]  Who disagrees as a bigot
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:51.000]  And instituted authoritarian
[03:52:51.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  Policies of reverse discrimination
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:52:55.000]  Four
[03:52:55.000 --> 03:52:57.000]  The policies and atmospheres
[03:52:57.000 --> 03:52:59.000]  Systematically ignore biological, cognitive
[03:52:59.000 --> 03:53:01.000]  Educational and social
[03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:03.000]  Science research
[03:53:03.000 --> 03:53:05.000]  And the nature and sources
[03:53:05.000 --> 03:53:07.000]  Of individual and group differences
[03:53:07.000 --> 03:53:09.000]  So again
[03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:11.000]  The fact that men and women
[03:53:11.000 --> 03:53:13.000]  Biologically different
[03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:15.000]  Suited to different jobs
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:17.000]  That men are more technically minded
[03:53:17.000 --> 03:53:19.000]  That women are more people minded
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:21.000]  That makes them better at certain jobs
[03:53:21.000 --> 03:53:23.000]  Which require greater communication
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:25.000]  Again, doesn't mean either is better than the other
[03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:27.000]  It means society works
[03:53:27.000 --> 03:53:29.000]  Because we have all bases covered
[03:53:29.000 --> 03:53:31.000]  God forbid
[03:53:31.000 --> 03:53:33.000]  But no, we can't have that
[03:53:33.000 --> 03:53:35.000]  We have to have this warped idea of equality
[03:53:35.000 --> 03:53:37.000]  Where everybody's the same
[03:53:37.000 --> 03:53:39.000]  Oh and by the way, everyone can just choose their
[03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:41.000]  Gender on a daily basis
[03:53:43.000 --> 03:53:45.000]  Absolutely incredible
[03:53:45.000 --> 03:53:47.000]  So now there's going to be a lawsuit against Google
[03:53:47.000 --> 03:53:49.000]  This is completely blown up in their face
[03:53:49.000 --> 03:53:51.000]  And again, it proves
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:53.000]  As Daily Caller reports today in an article
[03:53:53.000 --> 03:53:55.000]  Untitled
[03:53:55.000 --> 03:53:57.000]  Corporations remain the biggest threat to free speech
[03:53:57.000 --> 03:53:59.000]  The state is no longer the biggest threat
[03:53:59.000 --> 03:54:01.000]  When you've got a virtual monopoly
[03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:03.000]  On the creation of video commentary
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:05.000]  Which is what YouTube has got
[03:54:05.000 --> 03:54:07.000]  Owned by Google
[03:54:07.000 --> 03:54:09.000]  That's a monopoly, there's nowhere else to go
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:13.000]  People say just start your own YouTube network
[03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:15.000]  Just start your own video network
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:17.000]  No, it doesn't work like that
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:19.000]  For a start it would be
[03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:21.000]  You would not be able to afford it
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:23.000]  If you wanted to scale it up to any kind of level
[03:54:23.000 --> 03:54:25.000]  Secondly, it would be an echo chamber
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:27.000]  You'd be preaching to the choir
[03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:29.000]  That's completely pointless
[03:54:29.000 --> 03:54:31.000]  The whole idea of getting out on these social media networks
[03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:33.000]  Is to wake people up
[03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:35.000]  Is to give them the red pill
[03:54:35.000 --> 03:54:37.000]  And it worked
[03:54:37.000 --> 03:54:39.000]  Why do you think Trump won?
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:41.000]  Why do you think they're freaking out?
[03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:43.000]  Because it works
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:45.000]  So the solution is not just to leave these platforms
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:47.000]  The solution is to tackle
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:54:49.000]  These censorship issues head on
[03:54:49.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  Force these companies through pressure
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:53.000]  Into apologizing
[03:54:53.000 --> 03:54:55.000]  Support the whistleblowers
[03:54:55.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  Within these organizations that come out
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:54:59.000]  And expose this bias
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:01.000]  By the way, there's a fundraiser
[03:55:01.000 --> 03:55:03.000]  On Chuck Johnson's WeSearcher
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:05.000]  You can look for that
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:07.000]  It's typing WeSearcher
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:09.000]  Unless that's been banned by Google as well
[03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:11.000]  On search results
[03:55:11.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  Maybe to write a different search engine
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  WeSearcher.com has got a fundraiser for him
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:17.000]  To support him as he tries to
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:19.000]  Sue the company
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  So again, support these people
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  Speak out against Google
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:25.000]  Create a snowball of momentum
[03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  Of actual legitimate outrage
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:29.000]  Against them
[03:55:29.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  Completely crushing
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:33.000]  Free speech
[03:55:33.000 --> 03:55:35.000]  There's nothing more important than this
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:37.000]  Because if this
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:39.000]  Is allowed to be carried through
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:41.000]  We won't be here anymore
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:43.000]  Basically, that's simple
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:45.000]  Next, they'll target radio
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:47.000]  And we've seen moves to do that in the past
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:49.000]  With the fairness doctrine
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:51.000]  But again, this is an absolutely massive story
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:53.000]  We'll be doing a video on it
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:55:55.000]  Which will be up within the next couple of hours
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:55:57.000]  After I get off the show here
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:55:59.000]  Meanwhile, Gateway Pundit reports
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:01.000]  California bakeries
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:03.000]  Refused to bake Trump birthday cake
[03:56:03.000 --> 03:56:05.000]  For a nine-year-old boy
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:07.000]  Where's the SJW Lynch mob?
[03:56:07.000 --> 03:56:09.000]  Oh, so you remember Melissa's bakeries
[03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:11.000]  And all that scandal about
[03:56:11.000 --> 03:56:13.000]  Christians politely declining
[03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:15.000]  To bake a cake for a gay wedding
[03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:17.000]  And of course the liberals
[03:56:17.000 --> 03:56:19.000]  Were in absolutely up in arms
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:21.000]  But Google can
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:23.000]  Decline service to anyone who
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  Has a conservative opinion, that's okay
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:27.000]  But if you don't make a
[03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:29.000]  Wedding cake for a gay wedding
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:31.000]  Then you're in big trouble
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:33.000]  A mother of a nine-year-old boy
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:35.000]  Baked a pro-Trump birthday cake for her son
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:37.000]  After many bakeries refused to take the order
[03:56:37.000 --> 03:56:39.000]  Interestingly
[03:56:39.000 --> 03:56:41.000]  There is deafening silence
[03:56:41.000 --> 03:56:43.000]  From the same social justice warriors
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:45.000]  And left-wing fanatics
[03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:47.000]  Who wanted to force Christians to bake
[03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:49.000]  For a gay couple
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:56:51.000]  So again
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  Washington Times reported
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:55.000]  The media scrambled to verify the letter's authenticity
[03:56:55.000 --> 03:56:57.000]  Next day the Washington Post
[03:56:57.000 --> 03:56:59.000]  Confirmed it was sent by nine-year-old
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:01.000]  Dylan Harbin of California
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:03.000]  Surprise, surprise, it was in California
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:05.000]  So he asked for a Donald Trump
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:07.000]  Birthday cake
[03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:09.000]  And his mother tried to get all these
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:11.000]  Different bakeries to do it
[03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:13.000]  They all refused
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:15.000]  So it's okay to refuse service on
[03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:17.000]  Local grounds
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:19.000]  If the target is a conservative
[03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:21.000]  But not if it's a liberal
[03:57:21.000 --> 03:57:23.000]  Again, complete double
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:25.000]  Standard
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:27.000]  Absolutely incredible situation
[03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:29.000]  Let's move on to a few final stories
[03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:31.000]  In terms of the migrant crisis
[03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:33.000]  This was interesting out of Breitbart again
[03:57:33.000 --> 03:57:35.000]  Brussels police opened fire
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:37.000]  On vehicle in terror neighborhood
[03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:39.000]  Molenbeek explosives claimed to be inside
[03:57:39.000 --> 03:57:41.000]  Now you remember we got chased out of
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:43.000]  Molenbeek after the Paris attacks
[03:57:43.000 --> 03:57:45.000]  Police in Brussels claimed to have opened fire
[03:57:45.000 --> 03:57:47.000]  On a car in the Belgian capital
[03:57:47.000 --> 03:57:49.000]  After giving chase in the migrant heavy
[03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:51.000]  Suburban Molenbeek and arrested the driver
[03:57:51.000 --> 03:57:53.000]  The thing about this story is
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:55.000]  They were chasing him for running a red light
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:57:57.000]  They stopped him and he said
[03:57:57.000 --> 03:57:59.000]  Oh, by the way, I've got explosives in the car
[03:57:59.000 --> 03:58:01.000]  So it was just completely by random
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:03.000]  That this guy traveling through
[03:58:03.000 --> 03:58:05.000]  Molenbeek just happened to have
[03:58:05.000 --> 03:58:07.000]  Explosives in his car
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:09.000]  That's how messed up
[03:58:09.000 --> 03:58:11.000]  That Islamic ghetto
[03:58:11.000 --> 03:58:13.000]  And pursuing him as a terrorist
[03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:15.000]  And he turns out to be a likely terrorist
[03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:17.000]  The Italian government
[03:58:17.000 --> 03:58:19.000]  Denies migrant rescue activists vessel
[03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:21.000]  Access to ports
[03:58:21.000 --> 03:58:23.000]  That whole situation is starting to turn around
[03:58:23.000 --> 03:58:25.000]  After we put pressure on it
[03:58:25.000 --> 03:58:27.000]  Lawry drivers demand military
[03:58:27.000 --> 03:58:29.000]  Deploy to Calais after deadly migrant attacks
[03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:31.000]  The Calais camp has raised
[03:58:31.000 --> 03:58:33.000]  The migrants remain
[03:58:33.000 --> 03:58:35.000]  The attacks on the truck has continued
[03:58:35.000 --> 03:58:37.000]  Day after day after day
[03:58:37.000 --> 03:58:39.000]  That's going to wrap it up for the show
[03:58:39.000 --> 03:58:41.000]  InfoWars.com
[03:58:41.000 --> 03:58:43.000]  Again, look out for that video on this Google scandal
[03:58:43.000 --> 03:58:45.000]  Coming soon up on my YouTube channel
[03:58:45.000 --> 03:58:47.000]  InfoWars.com
