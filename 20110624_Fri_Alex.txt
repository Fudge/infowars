[01:05.480 --> 01:09.320]  that I didn't get to that I don't normally go back over news I didn't get
[01:09.320 --> 01:13.920]  to but a lot of this stuff is so important that I dropped the ball on
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.880]  yesterday we had a powerful broadcast very informative but could have been
[01:17.880 --> 01:23.320]  better and so I'm gonna go back over some of this and then I've got all of the
[01:23.320 --> 01:31.920]  other news very exciting things happening investors business daily that's
[01:31.920 --> 01:36.920]  investors business daily that's big establishment has the headline was fast
[01:36.920 --> 01:43.920]  and furious a gun control plot it's like info wars.com wrote this little
[01:43.920 --> 01:49.280]  beautiful jewel because the facts are that we've caught the Bureau of Alcohol
[01:49.280 --> 01:55.560]  tobacco farms and blowing up federal buildings excuse me explosives they are
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.400]  the boys who did that the evidence shows and leaked government document show
[01:59.400 --> 02:04.120]  very criminal group the folks that helped torch and destroy Waco these
[02:04.120 --> 02:11.360]  criminals these hardcore criminals have been caught engaging in an in a terrorist
[02:11.360 --> 02:16.000]  operation in a frame up in a false flag or whatever you want to call it and we
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.840]  have article out today over we were writing about this for six years
[02:19.840 --> 02:24.560]  Selle Castillo was set up and sent to prison for exposing this information on
[02:24.560 --> 02:29.440]  talk radio of course he was a former head DEA agent for all their Latin American
[02:29.440 --> 02:33.200]  operations and I had to tell you I didn't roll my eyes cuz I know Selle was a
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.440]  credible guy she's in prison right now but five six years ago when he sat on the
[02:38.440 --> 02:42.400]  show there's about to be a total collapse of Mexico the US government is
[02:42.400 --> 02:46.640]  gonna arm the drug cartels and they're arming Los Zetas and training them in
[02:46.640 --> 02:52.920]  South Texas and they the CIA tried to hire me because that's what he'd done
[02:52.920 --> 02:58.480]  was train Latin American squads in Latin America and he was of course
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.240]  Vietnam sniper in the whole whole nine and so they tried to recruit him to train
[03:03.240 --> 03:09.440]  Los Zetas six years ago I don't know 2006 yes it's been six years or right at
[03:09.440 --> 03:13.880]  six years and I still you know I had no other source but Selle saying that and
[03:13.880 --> 03:17.720]  then two years later all hell broke loose I mean nobody ever heard of Los
[03:17.720 --> 03:22.680]  Zetas and except on my show from Selle and then suddenly we hear all about
[03:22.680 --> 03:29.280]  it and then what was it two and a half years ago he started exposing that the
[03:29.280 --> 03:34.880]  ATF was shipping guns into Mexico on my show and other broadcast and again he
[03:34.880 --> 03:40.760]  was the only source of that and boy they set him up so fast and said he was a
[03:40.760 --> 03:50.400]  gun runner put him in prison for it a highly decorated Vietnam war veteran so
[03:50.400 --> 03:53.840]  as soon as Selle gets out we're gonna have to get him back on because you know
[03:53.840 --> 03:58.600]  he lived down in South Texas so he knew all the inside baseball on that but when
[03:58.600 --> 04:03.880]  you've got investors business daily and others coming out and basically going
[04:03.880 --> 04:10.720]  this isn't an ATF screw up this is an ATF terrorist operation well it's been
[04:10.720 --> 04:14.480]  even been on mainstream television that oh it was a coincidence that he was what
[04:14.480 --> 04:19.280]  six months before Oklahoma City bombing in 95 the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco
[04:19.280 --> 04:28.400]  firearms and explosives long name used to just be ATF now it's BATFE and they
[04:28.400 --> 04:35.480]  they did a test out in the desert of blowing up a rider truck yes and then
[04:35.480 --> 04:39.240]  that day they showed up in full bomb gear seconds after his cops were running
[04:39.240 --> 04:44.040]  in to save people and they told cops and in medics bandage us we were on the
[04:44.040 --> 04:47.720]  ninth floor and they went those elevators are blown out none of you were
[04:47.720 --> 04:52.840]  there and they said oh really police officer you're gonna be dead very soon
[04:52.840 --> 04:58.880]  of course they had to kill some medics and people had some cops as well very

[08:25.960 --> 08:29.720]  going to be covering the entire waterfront of geopolitical news economic
[08:29.720 --> 08:35.080]  news military news police state news domestic news max keiser just got back
[08:35.080 --> 08:39.880]  from greece and they've now made the announcement despite riots nationwide
[08:39.880 --> 08:44.640]  that the government is going to raise taxes and steal much of the public and
[08:44.640 --> 08:51.840]  private pension funds to pay off the fraudulent derivatives debts that
[08:51.840 --> 08:58.960]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and others paid off the government to sign on to and now
[08:58.960 --> 09:05.320]  magically we're told oh now it's Italy now it's Portugal now it's Spain guess
[09:05.320 --> 09:10.080]  what they're bankrupt to and then it will lead to england in Germany and the
[09:10.080 --> 09:15.200]  United States it is a debt black hole a mathematical certainty that this will
[09:15.200 --> 09:20.160]  implode the entire global economy and feed everything into the Ponzi scheme
[09:20.160 --> 09:24.440]  operators who have gotten their people into place in every major government
[09:24.440 --> 09:29.840]  spending decades to do it this is just the total takeover by Ponzi scheme
[09:29.840 --> 09:35.080]  operators of society and yesterday there was a p article with Ben Bernanke
[09:35.080 --> 09:39.640]  Osama Ben Bernanke the financial terrorists saying he is puzzled he
[09:39.640 --> 09:43.920]  doesn't know why the economy slowing and why we may never have really come out
[09:43.920 --> 09:48.120]  of the recession yeah it's a depression and he just doesn't know why all the
[09:48.120 --> 09:52.080]  trillions of stimulus didn't help because they give the stimulus to
[09:52.080 --> 09:57.960]  themselves the private big mega six banks and then charge us interest on our
[09:57.960 --> 10:03.600]  money we give them and so they get it at zero percent and then they loan it out
[10:03.600 --> 10:09.120]  to other banks it one to two percent and then there's some credit card rates the
[10:09.120 --> 10:14.880]  APR of seventy nine percent seventy nine point nine percent seeing it in and
[10:14.880 --> 10:20.080]  Reuters report so that's pretty good business and Obama called it credit card
[10:20.080 --> 10:27.400]  reform it it makes you shake your head in just disbelief at how obvious and out
[10:27.400 --> 10:32.280]  in the open this is but Americans don't have a lot of financial sense on average
[10:32.280 --> 10:35.680]  anymore Americans don't know how to engage in arithmetic without a
[10:35.680 --> 10:40.800]  calculator myself included we we have really just been turned into
[10:40.800 --> 10:47.920]  addled children by and large and it's a time to get informed it's time to dig
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.120]  in to the corruption of the central banking cartel I know that's not sexy
[10:53.120 --> 11:00.200]  and cool like American Idol or an NFL football game or the March Madness of
[11:00.200 --> 11:08.160]  your favorite soccer team but it affects all of us and we're not gonna have a
[11:08.160 --> 11:13.280]  well you know what a pot to do something in a window to throw it out of if we
[11:13.280 --> 11:16.720]  don't turn this around third-world countries have been run by this very
[11:16.720 --> 11:20.480]  same cartel for more than a hundred years now on average and you look at the
[11:20.480 --> 11:25.160]  state therein they have a corrupt police force there to rule over them and that
[11:25.160 --> 11:31.200]  is the attempted transformation that the global crime syndicate is attempting
[11:31.200 --> 11:34.920]  to bring us through right now we also have a video clip from C-span now you
[11:34.920 --> 11:39.240]  can watch it up at drugsreport.com the story is also up at info wars.com from
[11:39.240 --> 11:45.600]  cns news Geithner taxes on small businesses must rise so government
[11:45.600 --> 11:53.600]  doesn't shrink that's an actual quote and of course they have the federal
[11:53.600 --> 11:57.560]  government with hundreds of billions a year with the small business tax
[11:57.560 --> 12:02.040]  incentives and the federal government's supposed to give most of its contracts of
[12:02.040 --> 12:05.920]  small businesses but it's come out that basically small businesses are not even
[12:05.920 --> 12:10.160]  given the contracts and that it's being completely phased out and and and that
[12:10.160 --> 12:14.000]  not only Fortune 100 are getting it but predominantly offshore mega
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.600]  corporations are getting the small business contracts and that's like J.P.
[12:19.600 --> 12:27.360]  Morgan running the food stamp program here in the United States and running
[12:27.360 --> 12:32.760]  the joblessness claim system through the federal and state governments and so
[12:32.760 --> 12:38.600]  when you call if you're on unemployment you get a routed through to Indian and
[12:38.600 --> 12:42.720]  nothing against the Indians but Americans have been trained you need to be
[12:42.720 --> 12:48.440]  politically correct let the Chinese let the Mexicans let prisoners here in the
[12:48.440 --> 12:54.560]  US take these government phone calls instead of paying an American 10 bucks
[12:54.560 --> 12:58.440]  an hour to do it oh no we'll just pay somebody in prison 25 cents an hour will
[12:58.440 --> 13:03.320]  pay somebody in India 30 cents an hour it's it's it's insane but it's
[13:03.320 --> 13:07.560]  consolidating the entire economy this is not a global elite that want a free
[13:07.560 --> 13:12.160]  market they do not want a real economy they want to consolidate the economy to
[13:12.160 --> 13:16.400]  wreck the economy show that they can then bring in their global austerity
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.960]  measures and I broke this down with economists in 1999 right after they got
[13:21.960 --> 13:27.440]  rid of the Glass-Steagall Act and other banking acts and we explained that we
[13:27.440 --> 13:30.720]  said at the time hundreds of trillions of derivatives would be created your
[13:30.720 --> 13:34.640]  public and private pension funds in the stock market predominantly would be
[13:34.640 --> 13:39.440]  invested in them and then we would be held hostage by the banking cartel to
[13:39.440 --> 13:43.920]  well do what we say pay us more taxes once this Ponzi scheme falls or you'll
[13:43.920 --> 13:48.160]  never get any of what you invested out and see that's how they that's how they
[13:48.160 --> 13:54.600]  hold you hostage and then you bail out Ireland you bail out Iceland you and
[13:54.600 --> 13:58.160]  then you find out it's not bailouts to the people it's money to the banks the
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.800]  name is a lie I know I talk a lot about this but if we don't have an
[14:02.800 --> 14:09.160]  understanding of this it's only going to get worse now now I have a lot of news
[14:09.160 --> 14:15.600]  here that I want to get to today as I said Max Kaiser joining us on the news
[14:15.600 --> 14:24.240]  that they've capitulated and Greece is going to be fully gobbled by the big
[14:24.240 --> 14:29.520]  six banks and then the European countries that are quote bailing out
[14:29.520 --> 14:33.000]  Greece that means giving their tax money to the private banks that engineered
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.560]  the fraud they will then in turn be brought down and then the United States
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.720]  will have another round of so-called bailouts which are really just financial
[14:41.720 --> 14:47.960]  rape outs financial robberies and it won't matter it will be here in two
[14:47.960 --> 14:51.920]  years and just an all-out admitted depression and they will say raise taxes
[14:51.920 --> 14:56.040]  more pay us more and then with low raise taxes more pay more the economy
[14:56.040 --> 14:59.600]  will float even more and the banks come in flush with all that taxpayer money
[14:59.600 --> 15:06.760]  and buy up everything it's just an ongoing ongoing process of destroying
[15:06.760 --> 15:12.040]  our our wants free and vibrant free market society and then the best part is
[15:12.040 --> 15:17.920]  liberal magazines conservative magazines all of them put out disinfo that how
[15:17.920 --> 15:24.240]  did capitalism fail oh my gosh how do we redo capitalism capitalism did this
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.040]  and when they say capitalism they mean free market when this is the opposite
[15:28.040 --> 15:33.360]  this is government in collusion with big mega banks on record who openly say
[15:33.360 --> 15:36.440]  after they're done wrecking the global economy they're gonna have a post
[15:36.440 --> 15:41.320]  industrial world where everything is tracked and traced and global currencies
[15:41.320 --> 15:45.040]  are based on carbon credits that are paid to the IMF and World Bank on their
[15:45.040 --> 15:50.160]  private shareholders I mean just every activity everything you do and they put
[15:50.160 --> 15:54.080]  out in Europe and in England we've played these before and folks watch these
[15:54.080 --> 15:59.560]  videos and they think that it's a joke but no this was funded by Apple by the
[15:59.560 --> 16:03.400]  London Guardian by the British government by other groups where they have five
[16:03.400 --> 16:07.160]  minute cartoons well technical four and a half minute cartoons that they show
[16:07.160 --> 16:13.280]  before movies and theaters in Europe and that they show to schoolchildren where
[16:13.280 --> 16:17.200]  it says you are a prisoner in one area of a city you're only allowed to have
[16:17.200 --> 16:21.400]  meat once a year everything you do is tracked and it's wonderful you see their
[16:21.400 --> 16:27.760]  tactic is just to completely throw it in your face and just sell absolute
[16:27.760 --> 16:36.240]  tyranny is something good and we've just somehow got to beat this we've somehow
[16:36.240 --> 16:41.440]  got to turn this around now there's a lot of good news Google at the center of
[16:41.440 --> 16:46.640]  an antitrust probe that's out of Reuters another headline Wall Street Journal
[16:46.640 --> 16:50.560]  feds the launch probe of Google the problem is Google gives so much money
[16:50.560 --> 16:54.520]  to these election campaigns that but there's no doubt Google is becoming a
[16:54.520 --> 17:00.240]  monopoly and it's predatory and it violates everybody's rights and is the
[17:00.240 --> 17:06.480]  Walmart of the internet but they make Walmart and their practices look like
[17:06.480 --> 17:12.680]  leave it to beaver but their slogans don't be evil and the Patriot Act is
[17:12.680 --> 17:17.720]  called the Patriot Act and the government sticking their hands in your
[17:17.720 --> 17:21.080]  pants and grabbing your genitals is called a pat down so it just must be a
[17:21.080 --> 17:27.520]  pat down not a grope down so it's all semantical deception Google's paid
[17:27.520 --> 17:32.480]  Schmidt may be subpoenaed by Senate antitrust probers Bloomberg on that but
[17:32.480 --> 17:38.160]  what I oh and also Washington blog up at info wars.com always with great
[17:38.160 --> 17:43.320]  boil downs has a report here and then he links to all the mainstream news in
[17:43.320 --> 17:51.240]  Japan and Europe and in the press release by Tepco Tokyo electric power
[17:51.240 --> 17:58.600]  company admitting what we already told you that within days highly radioactive
[17:58.600 --> 18:03.560]  smog had hit the United States and then gone across the Atlantic into Africa it
[18:03.560 --> 18:08.760]  got picked up there at off-the-charts levels making sure noble and the report
[18:08.760 --> 18:15.080]  goes over all this look like a health spa clinic and then the we told you two
[18:15.080 --> 18:19.600]  months ago the EPA just raised the levels and says it's safe so no need for
[18:19.600 --> 18:24.360]  this to be on your nightly news enjoy the radiation and they've finally got some
[18:24.360 --> 18:28.120]  news in Seattle some mainstream TV reported last week that oh yes the
[18:28.120 --> 18:34.240]  average Seattleer is getting five hot particles a day of highly radioactive
[18:34.240 --> 18:40.320]  plutonium uranium and other nastinesses and many studies show that one of those
[18:40.320 --> 18:45.080]  might take 20 years to kill you but it's gonna kill you and we've had a lot of
[18:45.080 --> 18:49.120]  physicists and doctors on to break that down that it'll just our cancer rate will
[18:49.120 --> 18:54.520]  go up just the nuclear testing alone along with Chernobyl in the northern
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.560]  hemisphere the northern hemisphere of the globe has double on average and now
[18:58.560 --> 19:01.880]  it's set to go up even more double the background radiation of the southern
[19:01.880 --> 19:06.120]  hemisphere because the jet streams go in circles and the jet streams in the
[19:06.120 --> 19:11.080]  north don't ever really get to the to the south so it really is contained to a
[19:11.080 --> 19:13.800]  certain extent I mean there's some winds that drift down to the south of the
[19:13.800 --> 19:20.600]  north and certainly water currents do you have really a different path more
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.680]  complex but it's the earth spinning so you've got you've got this choreolous
[19:25.680 --> 19:31.680]  effect going around in circles and so we're already doubles I mean why not go
[19:31.680 --> 19:35.720]  be the more I mean it's good for you and we've got higher cancer rates in the
[19:35.720 --> 19:40.160]  northern hemisphere in the southern but hey don't be a conspiracy theorist now
[19:40.160 --> 19:44.760]  they admit at least three of these six plants completely melted down each one
[19:44.760 --> 19:48.360]  of them many times bigger than Chernobyl and the other two of the others had
[19:48.360 --> 19:52.400]  partial meltdowns and they're not sure about the sixth reactor but hey we were
[19:52.400 --> 19:57.120]  completely right about that well not quite it was worse than we said okay but
[19:57.120 --> 20:00.440]  I'm a conspiracy theorist we'll be right back

[24:10.560 --> 24:31.960]  okay before I get into all of the economic news the political news and a
[24:31.960 --> 24:37.040]  bunch of news stories I've seen attacking myself and others written by
[24:37.040 --> 24:43.640]  Democrats including an article in the Fort Worth Star telegram saying that
[24:43.640 --> 24:50.200]  it's politically motivated to go after the TSA groping and that we're just
[24:50.200 --> 24:56.480]  anti-Obama people this hasn't even really been political about Obama I mean
[24:56.480 --> 24:59.800]  it's been political with the head of Homeland Security but people were mad
[24:59.800 --> 25:04.000]  when Bush was doing all of this and it was Bush that launched all of this in
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.320]  the nanny state the prisoner training it's Republicans and Democrats in the
[25:10.320 --> 25:14.240]  House of Representatives here in Texas it was a unanimous vote by Democrats and
[25:14.240 --> 25:18.520]  Republicans to get rid of it and then it got killed a month ago but it's back up
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.080]  for a vote today and set to pass and so the Fort Worth Star telegram like I saw
[25:23.080 --> 25:31.440]  it out there I'll have to oh here it is silly season continues as lawmakers
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.560]  take up yet another Perry inspired emergency and it's in an in attacks
[25:36.560 --> 25:43.040]  yours truly in the article and says apparently while Rick Perry's away on
[25:43.040 --> 25:48.640]  his pre presidential kickoff talk show hosts are running Texas and they say
[25:48.640 --> 25:52.360]  because Senator Dan Patrick's a former radio host and because I'm a radio host
[25:52.360 --> 25:57.280]  that were evil demagogues and that we shouldn't have any problem with our
[25:57.280 --> 26:02.080]  families being groped you know most of these House members that voted unanimously
[26:02.080 --> 26:05.200]  or on record saying they had their genitals crushed or their daughters
[26:05.200 --> 26:09.000]  grabbed and it's Republicans and Democrats and this is a great
[26:09.000 --> 26:15.600]  illustration of why the system is so scared of this TSA issue because it's
[26:15.600 --> 26:21.200]  not about being black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Portuguese or
[26:21.200 --> 26:28.640]  Japanese or Christian or Muslim race religion ethnicity Dallas Cowboy fans
[26:28.640 --> 26:32.320]  Washington Redskins fans it's not about all the stupid tribalism that they use
[26:32.320 --> 26:37.160]  a divide us it's about hey I'd rather face whatever danger there is of the
[26:37.160 --> 26:44.280]  made-up Al Cia to threat you know 17,000 times better chance of dying in a car
[26:44.280 --> 26:50.480]  wreck than being killed by Al Qaeda I'll take my chances and it's all about the
[26:50.480 --> 26:53.240]  phony drug war that's what the TSA is really about is just going through your
[26:53.240 --> 26:57.560]  your goods and expanding out on the streets of America federal power grab
[26:57.560 --> 27:01.960]  it's now happening and so all over the country you've got Republicans you got
[27:01.960 --> 27:09.040]  Democrats you got state houses coming out and saying no no no no no and then I
[27:09.040 --> 27:14.080]  see articles all over the country all over I mean I without even looking I
[27:14.080 --> 27:18.120]  saw like five of these last night this morning including this big one in the
[27:18.120 --> 27:25.560]  Fort Worth Star Telegram this is considered an emergency state business
[27:25.560 --> 27:31.480]  by almost nobody besides Perry and radio host in particular Alex Jones I mean
[27:31.480 --> 27:37.640]  when I read this article every line is deception and disinformation and lies I
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.840]  mean these establishment hacks a fifth grader could have written this no one
[27:43.840 --> 27:49.440]  is concerned but the unanimous house vote and they had 130 something only
[27:49.440 --> 27:53.760]  one senator against it until they use procedure to kill it and it was Rick
[27:53.760 --> 27:57.720]  Perry's guy who killed it and then Rick Perry wouldn't put it on the session the
[27:57.720 --> 28:02.200]  special session until he was put under national pressure and this guy goes on
[28:02.200 --> 28:07.600]  to say oh it's just about bashing Obama and no one thinks it's a big deal but
[28:07.600 --> 28:11.680]  Rick Perry and some top show host and then he goes on to imply we're working
[28:11.680 --> 28:18.240]  for Rick Perry well I thought according to D magazine's Dallas blog I work for
[28:18.240 --> 28:27.040]  Obama can't you so the right-wingers are saying this is a plot by Obama and the
[28:27.040 --> 28:33.160]  Democrats are saying it's a plot by Perry see the system wants to keep this in
[28:33.160 --> 28:37.720]  place not Republicans not Democrats they're just kept political prostitutes
[28:37.720 --> 28:44.800]  who pimp the rest of the public and so they just throw into the mix oh you you
[28:44.800 --> 28:49.960]  you nobody cares about this but Alex Jones and Rick Perry and senator Patrick
[28:49.960 --> 28:55.640]  and the article goes on to say that and we're completely insane really and then
[28:55.640 --> 28:58.840]  meanwhile the guy did any of his homework he'd know it was unanimous vote in
[28:58.840 --> 29:03.080]  he obviously hit his homework he obviously knows that these things are
[29:03.080 --> 29:10.840]  mind-blowing and that's why the mainstream media is is kaput is is like a
[29:10.840 --> 29:18.800]  dodo bird you know there's only one of them left what's the line from mega
[29:18.800 --> 29:28.080]  deaths countdown to extinction all are gone only one okay we're gonna come back

[33:00.320 --> 33:17.320]  front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[33:17.320 --> 33:26.480]  all right I've got a key breakdown of the mafia government that we live under
[33:26.480 --> 33:34.200]  here in just a few minutes dealing with James Joseph Whitey Bolger where it's
[33:34.200 --> 33:38.800]  admitted that he worked for the FBI and that's why he could steal hundreds of
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.280]  millions of dollars he was rumored when he ran off to have 50 million he could
[33:43.280 --> 33:48.120]  kill whoever he wanted including connections to police officers that
[33:48.120 --> 33:53.600]  would speak out against corruption well Bolger's boys would kill him and we've
[33:53.600 --> 33:59.240]  cops ever found out the FBI is the designate hit group to murder police
[33:59.240 --> 34:03.280]  you'd actually grow up and realize why old-time police departments didn't like
[34:03.280 --> 34:08.600]  the FBI remember it was the FBI told us until the 50s that organized crime didn't
[34:08.600 --> 34:15.440]  exist because the FBI is organized crime they are the regulators of organized
[34:15.440 --> 34:19.920]  crime and it's time for America to grow up I'm willing to go up against the
[34:19.920 --> 34:25.400]  number one mafia in the United States the FBI and I'm willing to call them out
[34:25.400 --> 34:29.320]  the least you can do is research what I'm about to cover now does that mean the
[34:29.320 --> 34:33.920]  FBI agent that goes to bank robberies or kidnapped kids as a bad person no
[34:33.920 --> 34:40.320]  they're great people there's two FBI's there's two Delta forces there's two
[34:40.320 --> 34:45.640]  Marine Force recon's there's two sealed team sixes there's two camp x-rays at
[34:45.640 --> 34:50.720]  least two and when you learn this about the globalist and their compartmentalization
[34:50.720 --> 34:54.920]  you'll understand everything they're masters of organization and
[34:54.920 --> 35:02.200]  compartmentalization and when you learn that there was a war in the mid-1950s
[35:02.200 --> 35:07.960]  against Italian La Cosa Nostra and the other mobs that's why they had to finally
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.920]  admit there was a mafia just because the Italians began to actually challenge the
[35:12.920 --> 35:18.120]  wasp and the Jewish mafia who all worked together and I don't want to get
[35:18.120 --> 35:23.660]  off into this whole story but you know my dad's great uncle ran dairies in South
[35:23.660 --> 35:30.440]  Texas producing whiskey in prohibition he worked with some of the big bootleggers
[35:30.440 --> 35:36.320]  here in Austin I didn't learn about that to let years later doing research just
[35:36.320 --> 35:40.120]  some of the wealthiest people in this town made their money bootlegging you
[35:40.120 --> 35:47.480]  know that's how they I don't want to get it people need to grow up grow up grow
[35:47.480 --> 35:54.200]  up I mean I've had I've had family connections to say sheriffs in East
[35:54.200 --> 35:59.160]  Texas you know and this is going back 60 70 years and only certain people are
[35:59.160 --> 36:06.680]  allowed to make the moonshine I mean grow up grow up grow up grow up grow up
[36:06.680 --> 36:10.880]  ladies and gentlemen all right I said I get to that in a minute because I
[36:10.880 --> 36:15.140]  covered this years ago I covered this back in the mid 90s with whitey
[36:15.140 --> 36:19.240]  bulger because it's such a great example of this I mean this guy could do
[36:19.240 --> 36:24.140]  whatever he wanted and later it came out oh he worked for the FBI and they knew
[36:24.140 --> 36:30.840]  full well what he was doing he was their hitman and it wasn't until later the
[36:30.840 --> 36:36.000]  state police in Boston were tired of it because of bald zero that's what you
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.120]  don't see in the mainstream media likened you know knock off cops the
[36:40.120 --> 36:44.880]  police finally did their job and started the investigation then the DEA had to
[36:44.880 --> 36:48.840]  come in the feds would even send in the FBI to kind of just manage the
[36:48.840 --> 36:52.400]  investigation and cover it up I mean do you think it's only Mexico where the
[36:52.400 --> 36:56.640]  police are involved in corruption they've had rounds in New York's history
[36:56.640 --> 37:00.280]  over and over again the last hundred years where the where they have to lay
[37:00.280 --> 37:03.800]  off the majority of the police detectives and get rid of them just to
[37:03.800 --> 37:07.640]  stop total corruption notice they haven't had any of those purges now what
[37:07.640 --> 37:15.080]  since the late 70s because now the criminals have fully taken over you
[37:15.080 --> 37:19.560]  see I alright I'm gonna start over in a minute because I want to I want to take
[37:19.560 --> 37:25.280]  my time on this I had a Max Kaiser and Bob Chapman joining us but before I go
[37:25.280 --> 37:30.160]  any further we have a symbiotic goal here number one is to get the word out
[37:30.160 --> 37:35.240]  and to really show people that the angles because you can look at something
[37:35.240 --> 37:38.320]  the way the mainstream media presents it and never get the world but we just
[37:38.320 --> 37:43.680]  show you the a different angle you're like whoa I I never saw that before so
[37:43.680 --> 37:47.760]  we're not here to catch fish for you intellectually we're here to teach you
[37:47.760 --> 37:54.800]  that you already know how to catch fish okay and there's also again it's
[37:54.800 --> 37:57.880]  symbiotic that when you buy the books you buy the videos it funds what we're
[37:57.880 --> 38:01.480]  doing the TV system we're launching the new studios we've built we've already
[38:01.480 --> 38:05.000]  seen some of the special reports we've shot in there we have actually two
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.440]  studios over there and what we're doing and has taken us years to set up is
[38:09.440 --> 38:12.360]  what Glenn Beck is now duplicating which I think is great and he's even
[38:12.360 --> 38:15.720]  promoting it the same way showing his studio being built and all that it's
[38:15.720 --> 38:19.080]  wonderful that's the most sincere form of flattery he just wasn't pulling dirty
[38:19.080 --> 38:22.240]  tricks against me constantly I wouldn't have that big a problem with him but
[38:22.240 --> 38:26.080]  whatever I understand he wants to get rid of the real McCoy and the body
[38:26.080 --> 38:30.160]  snatcher always wants to get rid of the original body you know the counterfeit
[38:30.160 --> 38:34.280]  it's important for them to you know to stash the body somewhere but we're not
[38:34.280 --> 38:40.720]  going away we're getting bigger here pal but but I'm already digressing the
[38:40.720 --> 38:44.160]  point is we do need to continue to grow and the more money we get in the more
[38:44.160 --> 38:49.000]  we can expand our operations but at the same time the economy is in the dump is
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.520]  in the sewage line as many of you know so we've over the years just keep cutting

[41:51.200 --> 41:56.480]  say I was in the coffee room but I have this compulsion against lying even if
[41:56.480 --> 42:00.080]  it's a white lie where I want to tell you a story but I don't want to then give
[42:00.080 --> 42:03.920]  you the absolute true story because it doesn't sound good and I fight the
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.440]  compulsion to lie you know they've done studies that everybody lies and I do
[42:08.440 --> 42:13.400]  lie as my wife says this is look good on me and it's just better to not you
[42:13.400 --> 42:18.080]  tell women are it's just better to say yeah yeah looks great it's because for
[42:18.080 --> 42:20.840]  summer she's not really asking me I don't know why all the girlfriends had
[42:20.840 --> 42:24.200]  before I was married same thing it's like they don't want to hear that really
[42:24.200 --> 42:27.680]  what you think in fact sometimes you'll tell them that looks really great what
[42:27.680 --> 42:30.880]  you're wearing then they think maybe it doesn't are you sure are you sure I'm
[42:30.880 --> 42:37.200]  gonna say yeah yeah it looks okay maybe change the shoes so we all lie but I
[42:37.200 --> 42:42.880]  really try on this radio show to not shade the truth in any way so there you
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.360]  go the decision to give you this incredible special was made while my
[42:47.360 --> 42:50.880]  fly was down at the urinal that's how hard we're working here at this office
[42:50.880 --> 42:55.120]  ladies and gentlemen fact I've heard one of the sales guys conducting sales
[42:55.120 --> 43:01.880]  calls okay I'm gonna stop right there you know I've I've pledged to myself I
[43:01.880 --> 43:07.120]  have pledged to myself to be in a better mood and to be who I really am and to
[43:07.120 --> 43:12.200]  not be so angry because it affects me after work even at midnight I can't go
[43:12.200 --> 43:15.880]  to sleep because I get so upset about things and I've never had my stomach
[43:15.880 --> 43:18.720]  hurt I think I'm starting to get an ulcer from things from worrying about
[43:18.720 --> 43:21.920]  things too much so I'm just gonna be a little more happy have a little more
[43:21.920 --> 43:28.680]  fun here on air and occasionally screw around a bit so I apologize for being
[43:28.680 --> 43:36.160]  truthful with you oh boy now I feel like taking a break here just because the
[43:36.160 --> 43:41.320]  news I have see here's the problem I'm a happy-go-lucky guy and then when I
[43:41.320 --> 43:49.280]  cover news I've already researched all of this news and then so now it doesn't
[43:49.280 --> 43:53.840]  have that first look excitingness to it it has more of that disgusting I've
[43:53.840 --> 43:58.560]  already seen that dead horse in the ditch to continue the horse analogies and I
[43:58.560 --> 44:01.680]  need to go over there and look at it and smell it again to know it's there but
[44:01.680 --> 44:07.880]  for you some of you it's a new dead horse that that isn't in the ditch but
[44:07.880 --> 44:12.000]  is being catapulted at our society by the globalist and they're telling us
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.520]  that they're catapulting cherry pie at us and they're not I'd rather take a
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.080]  cherry pie in the face than a dead horse the dead horse would break your neck and
[44:21.080 --> 44:27.240]  so I'm now going to attempt to get out of the screwing around mode and cover
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.240]  this next news because this is weighty news and I don't really feel like I'm
[44:31.240 --> 44:38.040]  even worthy to bring you news and information of this magnitude but
[44:38.040 --> 44:54.520]  nevertheless nevertheless I am going to cover this news here for you now just
[44:54.520 --> 44:59.880]  want to have a moment of peace here a moment of a moment of tranquil calm a
[44:59.880 --> 45:09.360]  moment of contemplation about where we are in the world because this radio
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.160]  show tends to flash by in three hours and according some type of bizarre time
[45:14.160 --> 45:37.280]  warp and I want what I'm about to cover to really sink in for people they say
[45:37.280 --> 45:42.080]  silence is golden don't they and talk radio it really tends to get your
[45:42.080 --> 45:50.400]  attention and I'm not somebody that has silent pauses often but I think it's
[45:50.400 --> 46:00.320]  important to do it sometimes isn't to really note something important okay I
[46:00.320 --> 46:05.120]  have a report here I'm sure you've already heard about this this news came
[46:05.120 --> 46:11.840]  out a day and a half ago but now he's headed back to Boston to face trial I
[46:11.840 --> 46:16.840]  wonder if he's going to a die while in jail because they're not going to want
[46:16.840 --> 46:27.920]  what this individual knows to be aware of anything and to be able to warn the
[46:27.920 --> 46:33.800]  public can whitey bulger help solve biggest art heist in US history and
[46:33.800 --> 46:38.880]  it goes to the fact that the $500 million in paintings were stolen they
[46:38.880 --> 46:42.680]  believe whitey bulger did it and I just mentioned this first article to give you
[46:42.680 --> 46:47.840]  an idea about what a criminal this guy was hundreds of millions of dollars of
[46:47.840 --> 46:54.120]  criminal activity in the Massachusetts and surrounding areas and all of the
[46:54.120 --> 47:06.520]  corruption that he was able to get away with over the years and then see this
[47:06.520 --> 47:21.880]  is how my brain works when I see a report like this it it makes me think
[47:21.880 --> 47:29.080]  about other things like investors business daily actually telling the
[47:29.080 --> 47:38.680]  truth was fast and furious a gun control plot and it goes over the US
[47:38.680 --> 47:44.560]  government knowingly for several years under Obama's ATF and knowingly
[47:44.560 --> 47:50.040]  surveilling and helping get illegal guns shipped in to Mexico and then of
[47:50.040 --> 48:06.120]  course you have the head of the ATF being caught lying we have the ATF head
[48:06.120 --> 48:10.160]  refusing to step down arrogantly because they have to as gangsters they have to
[48:10.160 --> 48:14.640]  always train you that they're able to just get away with anything that's what
[48:14.640 --> 48:18.880]  the gangsterish TSA is all about it's about training you your little people
[48:18.880 --> 48:23.680]  your scum your trash we'll do whatever we want to you but the fact is if we'll
[48:23.680 --> 48:29.680]  just call a spade a spade we'll call the elephant in the room an elephant then
[48:29.680 --> 48:33.560]  we can as a society be honest about it and and and do something about it so I
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.840]  want to get into that report coming up but first I want to talk about whitey
[48:37.840 --> 48:44.000]  bulger who finally got caught living in obscurity after disappearing for
[48:44.000 --> 48:51.560]  more than 15 years you've been caught in California and it's admitted if you
[48:51.560 --> 48:55.400]  don't know the whole whitey bulger case you can look it up that for decades he
[48:55.400 --> 49:06.680]  murdered he killed he ordered murders that that he was untouchable and then
[49:06.680 --> 49:10.680]  later it came out after the Boston police along with the state police
[49:10.680 --> 49:15.600]  refused to go along with it anymore that the reason he was protected was that he
[49:15.600 --> 49:21.120]  was a informant to the FBI and then the highest levels of the FBI knew about it
[49:21.120 --> 49:26.880]  and were aware of it and that he was paying generally about 25 percent of
[49:26.880 --> 49:33.200]  all of his hundreds and hundreds of millions of profit to the FBI and that's
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.240]  why they would never bust him but it's the same in every city it's the same in
[49:37.240 --> 49:42.400]  every crime region and that's the way it's always worked there's a reason that
[49:42.400 --> 49:48.120]  when prohibition was overthrown after a decade in the early 30s that they then
[49:48.120 --> 49:53.360]  made drugs illegal you could buy cocaine heroin opium whatever you wanted at the
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.440]  corner drugstore and you go to the statistics there was much less drug use
[49:57.440 --> 50:01.160]  of course a lot less drug overdose because it was really seen as a disease
[50:01.160 --> 50:06.600]  and pathetic and something bad but I'm making it illegal now the criminals get
[50:06.600 --> 50:10.560]  it now they got fancy cars now it's seen as cutting-edge and rebellious and
[50:10.560 --> 50:14.360]  Hollywood pushed that image of course so that young people would use the drugs
[50:14.360 --> 50:19.280]  also the big mega banks and the crime syndicates and their minions you know
[50:19.280 --> 50:24.720]  they talk about whitey bulger being a big heavy hitter and they talk about
[50:24.720 --> 50:35.120]  people like whitey bulger being the boss always the gutter level so-called bosses
[50:35.120 --> 50:40.880]  are really just the the the lower compartment of the criminal system but
[50:40.880 --> 50:46.080]  we're told that's as high as it goes when in truth it's the mega banks then the
[50:46.080 --> 50:51.800]  FBI CIA under them then controlling the different organized crime syndicates
[50:51.800 --> 50:56.640]  who they then use the low-level criminals who we we're told at the top
[50:56.640 --> 51:01.640]  the competition but we'll break it all down we come back this is Alex Jones with
[51:01.640 --> 51:05.360]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[51:05.360 --> 51:09.160]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[51:09.160 --> 51:13.680]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric

[51:21.560 --> 51:25.920]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[51:25.920 --> 51:29.720]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[51:29.720 --> 51:33.800]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[51:33.800 --> 51:37.760]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[54:00.720 --> 54:12.480]  Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[54:17.480 --> 54:26.160]  I know why a lot of people don't like to face corruption because it's it's scary
[54:26.160 --> 54:31.720]  it's disgusting and it'll freak you out to realize that you're in a very
[54:31.720 --> 54:37.080]  corrupt society but if we do realize this if we do face up to this we can
[54:37.080 --> 54:41.720]  save our Republic before I get back into the ATF caught running false flag
[54:41.720 --> 54:45.960]  against the Second Amendment key reported info wars.com and prismplanet.com
[54:45.960 --> 54:50.040]  and in case you think our evidence doesn't point at that you should go read
[54:50.040 --> 54:55.280]  the article or even investors business daily very prestigious was fast and
[54:55.280 --> 55:00.400]  furious a gun control plot of course it is you know Fox News is saying how the
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.240]  ATF screwed up and helped ship the guns in they've been caught lying to
[55:04.240 --> 55:09.360]  Congress they did this from the time Obama got in his strategy to repass the
[55:09.360 --> 55:13.360]  assault weapons ban and shut down gun shows including fake stings here in
[55:13.360 --> 55:19.320]  Austin was to shut down the Second Amendment via the crisis in Mexico
[55:19.320 --> 55:24.560]  okay but but I'm digressing or not even digressing that's what I want to get to
[55:24.560 --> 55:29.560]  later remember you pull this up like I want I've dug this up before I want to
[55:29.560 --> 55:33.360]  dig it up again we've got it in some documentary from CBS in the 80s about
[55:33.360 --> 55:37.160]  La Cosa Nostra and the mafia but I know we've got the clip and played it years
[55:37.160 --> 55:40.960]  ago but it's just like I can't find the clip of Rick Perry on my show I know it's
[55:40.960 --> 55:44.800]  from four years ago we got a archive stuff and figure out some system to do
[55:44.800 --> 55:51.600]  that with really cool stuff but it was the head of the FBI Jagger Hoover saying
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.840]  that La Cosa Nostra organized crime period did not exist no no no he was
[55:56.840 --> 56:01.440]  saying this decades after people knew that there were gangs and organized crime
[56:01.440 --> 56:05.920]  but he was saying they were unorganized because they were blackmailing him but
[56:05.920 --> 56:11.960]  more than just blackmailing Jagger Hoover the FBI from its inception was only
[56:11.960 --> 56:16.520]  there to shut down their competition they didn't go after Joseph Kennedy the
[56:16.520 --> 56:22.800]  biggest bootlegger on the East Coast they didn't go after the mafia in
[56:22.800 --> 56:27.680]  Chicago they didn't go after any of those groups they only went after later
[56:27.680 --> 56:33.280]  Italian mafia because they got too big for their britches and they still didn't
[56:33.280 --> 56:36.840]  want to get them for anything it's kind of like Ken Starr going after Clinton
[56:36.840 --> 56:40.240]  for lying about having sex with Monica Lewinsky they don't want to go after him
[56:40.240 --> 56:43.920]  for missile secrets or corruption or payoffs because that was court that was
[56:43.920 --> 56:47.360]  connected to the Republican leadership that's why they use the IRS to go after
[56:47.360 --> 56:51.480]  Al Capone something that wasn't connected to everything else and all the
[56:51.480 --> 56:56.520]  other syndicates so it's it's basically using government to knock off their
[56:56.520 --> 57:00.720]  competition instead of just shooting him with a Tommy gun but when the
[57:00.720 --> 57:05.560]  government wants to kill you they hire mafia to do it in many cases and that's
[57:05.560 --> 57:11.400]  why there were some mafia hitmen snipers on record in and around with the JFK
[57:11.400 --> 57:15.760]  killing and they had some other backups and they had a Howard Hunt deathbed
[57:15.760 --> 57:22.200]  confession you know also there in the background and the CIA when it was OSS in
[57:22.200 --> 57:28.400]  in in World War two had used mafia in Europe as ways to get intelligence on
[57:28.400 --> 57:33.160]  the Nazis the Nazis did the same thing so so so these relationships have always
[57:33.160 --> 57:38.480]  been there and you're naive if you say that they aren't but the whole thing
[57:38.480 --> 57:42.560]  with whitey bulger is this here's a guy where in the fine print it's confirmed
[57:42.560 --> 57:48.880]  he was protected by the FBI and paying high-level FBI off for decade after
[57:48.880 --> 57:54.920]  decade after decade and finally the state police got tired of it started an
[57:54.920 --> 57:59.120]  investigation and that forced the feds to come in and then bulger was allowed to
[57:59.120 --> 58:04.120]  basically flee but for whatever reason now decades later the protection has been
[58:04.120 --> 58:08.400]  decided to be removed from bulger so they run a PR campaign where is bulger
[58:08.400 --> 58:12.360]  where is bulger and then magically days after the campaign they go in busting
[58:12.360 --> 58:16.480]  they knew where he was the entire time he was basically in an unofficial
[58:16.480 --> 58:21.040]  witness protection program and now why are they gonna burn bulger is the
[58:21.040 --> 58:27.120]  question has he have the people he could blackmail died has there been an
[58:27.120 --> 58:31.280]  inside deal where they stole the Swiss money I don't know but the whole thing
[58:31.280 --> 58:35.320]  is his pony is a $3 bill and people need to grow up and realize how corrupt
[58:35.320 --> 58:39.040]  this government is now we come back I'm gonna get into the ATF mafia stay

[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.920]  realizing the fact that I'm not covering enough information so I'm gonna
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:38.200]  finish up with the ATF mafia and then I'm going to get into all the financial
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.400]  news and what's happening globally because the dominoes are falling through
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.120]  Europe and coming towards England and the United States doorstep and
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.160]  everything that's being done to Greece has already been done here to one
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.520]  extent but it's it's only gonna get deeper by degree and there's also this
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:01.000]  article from yesterday big key report from Paul Joseph Watson then I could just
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.040]  kick myself for not covering I read this yesterday morning about 6 a.m. when
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:17.560]  Watson published it and along with it is actually the actual study did we ever
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.560]  print the actual study I just want to show folks that or maybe we go to
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.760]  Watson's article after the break we can click on the study and show it to folks
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:30.520]  via prisonplanet.tv new study finds direct link between vaccines and infant
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:39.800]  mortality and it is a it is a prestigious study so we're gonna be going
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:45.360]  over that going over that today I also have a member of the EU parliament
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:50.680]  Nigel Farage Baroso you have no plan B very powerful that's because
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.440]  everything's going according to plan Mr. Nigel Farage and we're gonna get Nigel
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.160]  back on the transmission and I know he knows that but he keeps going one
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.200]  company one one nation after and the next gets overthrown gets bankrupted and
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.560]  you keep saying everything's fine no it's not sir your world government plan is
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:17.200]  destroying us well that's because everything is going according to plan
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:26.560]  but this really is just a huge huge news and it is very very exciting to have
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.680]  this in the news to have it in investors business daily and other major
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:35.240]  publications are now calling it what it is Obama administration caught running
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:40.040]  false flag against the Second Amendment despite the Obama administration's best
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.560]  efforts to characterize operation fast and furious is a recently revealed ATF
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.720]  program that sought to put US based firearms in the hands of Mexican drug
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.680]  smugglers a little more than a screw-up the most damning evidence strongly
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.640]  indicates that the whole operation was in fact an attempt to launch a false flag
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:00.160]  assault on the Second Amendment rights of the American people and why do we know
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.120]  about this well we know about it because of ATF whistleblowers and again when I
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.120]  say the FBI's criminal at the top it is when I say the ATF is criminal at the
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.920]  top it is the average ATF agent is out there going for drug dealers that are
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.680]  selling guns and back alleys and being ordered to harass gun shops and things
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.200]  it's just a disreputable operation I just say let the guns be out there and
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.640]  let us defend ourselves from criminals and decriminalize the drugs so you know
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:31.000]  they don't have something to make money off of but whatever we know about this
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.640]  because ATF agents blew the whistle and now the head of the ATF has been caught
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:42.960]  lying really a scary organization a very very scary group and well Watson's
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:49.000]  article is extremely extremely lengthy and proves the larger history of this
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.400]  but what I'm gonna do in the interest of time because I've got to get to all
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.120]  this other news a wide spectrum of news is I'm going to with Bob Chapman a
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:04.840]  little bit in the third hour go over go over all of this and tie it into the
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:12.680]  whitey whitey bulger situation when he gets on with us when we come back from
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:21.120]  break I'm gonna get into Geithner saying we need to raise we need to raise taxes
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.000]  on small businesses so the government can continue to grow and we're also
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:33.080]  gonna get into the fact that Texas is set to vote on the TSA situation of the
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.440]  groping here in Texas today and the feds are saying we're gonna run a blockade
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:42.240]  of you and we're gonna sue Texas I mean at a certain point we've got to be able
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.000]  to put the feds back in the box the feds themselves run by the global crime
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.080]  syndicate so that is all coming up after this quick break on the other side
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:57.240]  this is the GCN radio network GCN live.com our websites are info wars.com
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:03.400]  we're streaming live video at prisonplot.tv hundreds of nations have fallen
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.240]  to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.520]  history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:17.160]  underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:22.240]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:27.280]  us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:32.080]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.800]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke,
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.760]  their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.600]  do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:50.600]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:56.560]  Republic on DVD at info wars.com or watch it online right now in super high
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:02.400]  quality at prisonplanet.tv. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.280]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:10.040]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.000]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.360]  you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.800]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country the
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.560]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:31.360]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:34.960]  local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.320]  related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.520]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.160]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You

[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:17.840]  Well he just got back from Greece and reportedly the traitorous Greek
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.720]  government. Despite the fact that polls show over 98% of the Greek people are
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:27.360]  saying we don't owe this money and they don't. This is a fraud. Papandreoff has
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:31.280]  paid off. We want you arrested. The traitorous paid off Greek government is
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:37.280]  saying we're gonna basically sign you on to the derivatives debt and then right
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:43.280]  on the heels they go okay well Ireland signed everything over. Greece has now
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.280]  Portugal and Italy have to and that will lead to Spain and Germany and just like
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.720]  Domino's because it's planned. It's designed. We have the IMF World Bank
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:59.960]  documents 2002. When they planned all of this it's going according to plan. The
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.960]  bankers sell you the derivatives and make giant profits then they tie all your
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.360]  pension funds into it. When they go belly up they say bail it out or it'll be the
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.280]  end of civilization as we know it but it's designed mathematically to where
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:18.800]  you can never fix it. It destroys you and transfers all your wealth to these
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.960]  guys and why would they do something like that because they're criminals. They
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:28.120]  don't want to have a good free market society. Now here's some of the economic
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:33.480]  news. Economic trouble puzzles Fed chief and he said that again today said it
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:38.560]  yesterday and again he says he knows the economy struggling and they don't know
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:45.640]  why and quote don't have a precise read on why the slower pace of growth is
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:53.120]  persisting. Even with their cooked phony crackerjack box numbers they're admitting
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:57.360]  the economy stalled. Folks it's a depression by every real yardstick. 20
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.800]  plus percent unemployment now for over two years. Inflation increasing. Food
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:07.200]  prices going up. Upwards of 48 million people now a few months ago was 44
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:12.440]  million. Upwards of 48 million now on food stamps. Do you imagine if 48 million
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:18.120]  people were in bread lines soup kitchen lines what that would look like. That
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.080]  would make the Great Depression look like a time of cornucopia. Okay a time
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:32.960]  of a volholic plenty. I mean you know bring out the roast pig and me. I mean
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:39.480]  we're in Odin's Palace here in 1933 compared to what is going on now but
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.360]  they know how to veneer it. They know how to hide it. They know how to ever
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.360]  everybody on welfare and then they have those welfare hordes that will do
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.680]  whatever they're told in the future to keep getting that check and the answer
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.040]  is they're going to take the middle class's money and here's the headline
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.640]  Geithner taxes of small businesses must rise so government doesn't shrink. You
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.760]  can watch the video clip there CNS news from his testimony. They say this stuff
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:09.800]  with a straight face continuing with the financial news. U.S. to lose second
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:15.000]  place in world trade to India. Yeah just a few months ago we drop from the
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:21.840]  number one trade group in the world to China and now we're set CNBC reports to
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:29.200]  India but they're saying it'll take time for that to happen. Continuing with
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.560]  this news we have a Bob Chapman article that has a good quote from the
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.960]  congressional record. Chance didn't create the economic crisis as the
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.120]  headline but Congressman Lewis McFadden said the Great Depression is as true
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.160]  today as it was in the 1930s. As chairman of the house banking committee he said
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.840]  quote it was no accident. It was a carefully contrived occurrence. The
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:57.160]  international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:06.000]  they might emerge as rulers of us all and they got great power at that time but
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.080]  now they're bringing us even into more tyranny under the carbon tax
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.040]  dictatorships. Look at this article from yesterday oil prices tumble after
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:21.200]  reserves released. The day before that Lindsey said nope the pressure's done it
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.800]  they're about to try to actually reduce them for a while before they go back up
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.600]  but again I don't think his sources or anybody's sources in the elite have all
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.000]  the answers or controlled everything. The globalists are trying to dominate
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.440]  society but more and more they're failing. In the past when people weren't
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.360]  aware of their designs they had almost a hundred percent success rate not any
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:46.120]  more. I'd say more like fifty percent fifty five sixty maybe that's why they're
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.160]  trying to really take over right now. So that's some of the news on that front
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.040]  here's some of the other financial news. Job picture grows worse as weekly claims
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:01.760]  post jump people getting unemployment jumping in this great we hadn't had a
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:07.920]  recession since june 2009 two years ago according to Bernanke so you know he
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.080]  says everything's fine don't be a conspiracy theorist don't question
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:15.120]  their cook numbers. Here's another report Reuters saying the same thing about
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.640]  jobs and deep trouble and again on the heels of Greece saying that they're
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.800]  going to go ahead and give the bankers whatever they want. Greece budget hole
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.480]  threatens to swallow Europe and next it's Italy and Portugal just as we told
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:35.120]  you years ago the chain of the order of who they'd be taking down. Bipartisan
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:40.160]  debt talks have grown more contention Republicans have a walk down of meetings
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:46.640]  dealing with raising the debt ceiling. All of that is rearranging debt chairs on
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:52.280]  the Titanic. The big issue here is that they are continuing QE to first they
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.320]  said they wouldn't do QE three but as Chapman predicted now they're saying we
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.280]  may do QE three well that will just accelerate the devaluation of the
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:08.680]  dollar so that's a default technically and it's not official default and the
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.120]  Chinese said that of course three weeks ago they said you've already are
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.840]  defaulting and that's why they're moving completely out of treasuries so are the
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.240]  Arabs and the average good old boy because I've had folks walk to me on the
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:21.960]  street and go I don't care of the dollar devalued it'll help manufacturing if we
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.600]  had any manufacturing left and if it was long term something that happened it
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:33.720]  might be help manufacturing but when you have the fact that that we've already
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:39.440]  been deindustrialized and you realize it's coming on so strong it's it's it's
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.240]  it's going to be devastating and the dollar being devalued will affect
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:51.160]  everybody's cost of living and destroy people on fixed incomes. Here's another
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.880]  report this is out of yahoo finance retirement as we know it is dead and they
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.600]  have a breakdown of that and saying now folks have to work till they're 85 well
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.120]  yeah that's past the time you're dead the average person what average male lives
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:10.000]  to 75 average female 77 here's another one so don't worry though when you're
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.120]  85 you'll be able to stop working they have another report here breaking down
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:22.160]  why are food prices rising so fast and CNBC CNBC asked the question salary up
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:27.760]  28% coffee up 40% they ask why well because the dollars being devalued
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.560]  that's why but CNBC doesn't doesn't seem to understand that doesn't seem to know
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:40.680]  that. Here's another report out of AP Greece presses banks low earners in
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:46.200]  debt crises Greece's beleaguered government said yesterday that it will
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:50.240]  start taxing minimum wage earners and encourage local banks to help the state
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:56.920]  delay debt payments for bonds metering as of 2015 and that's the austerity orders
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:01.280]  is to kill their credit and to technically default but not officially
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.400]  default and then start taxing the poorest people which has been done under
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.840]  the shock therapy doctrine of the IMF and World Bank and every third world
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:20.280]  country to destroy them it's designed to destroy them okay I want to get into
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:26.200]  the incredibly positive news in Libya and the incredibly positive news in our
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.880]  constitutional republic in the next segment ahead of Max Kaiser Hillary
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.880]  have it to come out yesterday and again today and saying what side are you on
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:39.640]  Congress we're on the side in the Obama administration of the Libyan people
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.720]  you mean the al Qaeda groups their funding and again if you gotta give me a
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.800]  choice between Qaddafi and al Qaeda I'm sorry I'm not gonna side with Qaddafi I
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.600]  don't like unsavory dictators but as far as dictators go he is actually
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.840]  benevolent in many respects and that place is the jewel of Africa now free
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:02.320]  health care the whole nine yards industrial development and the
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.640]  globalists don't like that you know they say the only way socialism works is if
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.960]  you have a dictator but it still doesn't work very well I'm not for it but
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.240]  there's that rare rare time that a blind hog can find an achron now I'm
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:22.920]  digressing the point is in Libya he actually delivered most of because the
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:27.320]  stuff's nationalized the oil and the rest of it to the people and that's why
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.840]  he's been very popular and the West is not gonna put up with that for a minute
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:39.200]  it's kind of like Tito it was a bad guy over over Serbia but after he died then
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:46.200]  the whole place fell apart Bosnia Herzegovina that whole region bordering
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:50.640]  to the to the north there will the south is Albania into the east Macedonia but I
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:54.200]  digress now he was somebody who actually delivered development of the
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.920]  people you know sometimes these guys are egomaniacs to the point they actually
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.640]  like to build stuff but but I digress I want to go to break with Nigel Farage
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:05.160]  pointing out to Herman von Roopie the guy that openly calls for world
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:10.280]  government the head of the EU that nothing he's done has worked well
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:14.600]  actually it has worked they're taking over Europe here it is mr. Broso every
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:19.280]  time I ask you what is your plan B you say there's no need and every time I
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.920]  predict that another country is on the verge of a bailout you say no no there's
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:28.920]  no problem and here we are on the verge of the second Greek bailouts and you
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:34.280]  say there is no alternative we must continue down this route we must ignore
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.640]  the fact that the Spanish bond market are telling us that they are going to be
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.880]  next what a fine mess you've got us into you have a 100% record for being
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:49.320]  wrong with every single prediction about the euro and when you say today that
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.160]  this package will put Greece on the road to growth I'll know it won't it'll put
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.320]  them on the road to the third bailout which will be discussing in a few short
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:04.200]  months time I have to say I find it a truly sickening sight to see the
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:09.160]  country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:14.080]  increasingly appalling international monetary fund and being told they have
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:20.200]  to accept this austerity package they have to accept cutting their economy to
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:25.200]  a level that'll put them into a total economic depression they're told there
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.160]  is no alternative to this it's a form of sado monetarism and it's sending them
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:35.040]  crazy they're on the streets and there's violence and frankly this can only get
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.160]  worse you've stripped them not just of money you've stripped them of their
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:44.160]  democracy so what good Europeans really good and and and he goes on to break it
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.400]  down but but see of course rumpy's been wrong a hundred percent to the public
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.120]  it's designed to strip them and they've done all the actuaries this will mean
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:57.720]  Greece can never pay it back which is the plan that's the post industrial
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:03.360]  world that's how they dominate since 2007 the Federal Reserve and the US
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.280]  government have injected as much as 20 trillion dollars into the economies of
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:11.680]  the world and yet the globes economies continue to contract our government is
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:15.520]  borrowing fifty eight thousand dollars per second if they stop spending the
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:20.160]  economy collapses if they continue spending the economy collapses and if

[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.480]  exposed the fact that most the debt was indeed created by the very banks that
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:59.880]  we're being bailed out and that it's all a fraud because this is the big

[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.040]  good news obviously I have the news articles here in front of me but
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:29.920]  driving in to work this morning listening to different TV stations that I
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.840]  have on my xn and also listening to local news I heard them playing clips of
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.920]  congressman republicans and democrats saying Obama is not an absolute
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.080]  dictator or king he must consult congress before launching a war and
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.840]  Libya is a war and they hate this it's bipartisan and it's it's the attack on
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:57.560]  the Constitution getting so brazen so naked naked as a J bird no debating and
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:01.680]  Obama saying I don't need your authority I got the UN's he didn't just say I have
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:08.280]  the authority myself it's even worse he said the UN is my boss it's like those
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.160]  Christian bumper stickers that say a Jewish carpenter is my boss well Obama
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:17.880]  ought to have a sticker saying unelected UN criminals are my boss we all have
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:22.600]  that as a as a joke satire bumper sticker quote for Barack Obama and stick
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:27.840]  that on cars and so you've got the house members suing him that'll just
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:32.120]  impeach is signed in right now this is a big deal I mean this is what Julius
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.720]  Caesar did it's what Napoleon did I mean it's what Latin American and African
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:39.080]  dictators do constantly and when the president starts saying I do whatever I
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:42.760]  want with the military you better look out we got checks and balances for a
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.240]  reason it's why we have states the fact like the states have no authority why
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.560]  do we have them then why do we have a Congress if it's just going to be
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:53.760]  ceremonial why do we have state legislatures it's all about separation of
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:27:00.600]  power checks and balances but I hear some of the quotes house ways cutting off
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.680]  funds for Libyan mission clearly fun frustrated with President Barack
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.000]  Obama's Republican leaders are propelling the house towards a crucial
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.440]  votes on the US military role in Libya that could embarrass the commander in
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:19.360]  chief and reverberate in Tripoli and NATO capitals I just believe that because
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.680]  of the president's failure to consult with the Congress you don't consult
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:29.480]  Congress runs it future to and a failure to outline for the American people why
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.560]  we are doing this before we engage in this puts us in the position where we
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.960]  have to defend our responsibility under the Constitution House Speaker John
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:45.440]  Boehner Republican of Ohio said in advancing two measures and it goes on
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.160]  quote the president has ignored the Constitution and the war powers
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.960]  resolution but he cannot ignore a lack of funding sub-representative Tom Rooney
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.320]  Republican of Florida sponsor of the bill only Congress has the power to
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.720]  declare war now that he got it right only Congress has the power to declare
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:11.440]  war and the power of the purse in my bill exercises both of those powers by
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.040]  blocking funds for the war in Libya unless the president receives
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.640]  congressional authorization house Republicans and Democrats are furious
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:22.880]  with Obama for failing to seek congressional authorization for the
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:28.360]  three-month-old war ah they called it a war in the AP just a few weeks ago the
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.760]  media would not call this a war the so-called corporate media but they
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:37.520]  lost so much credibility now from the LA Times to the Washington Times to the
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.080]  New York Times to the Wall Street Journal they're going Obama looks stupid
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:48.400]  saying it's not a war Obama is turning into a tyrant absolutely I mean but
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:54.880]  again not just an American tyrant a says a foreign group gives him his orders he
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:59.360]  put letters out to Congress months ago saying I don't need to even consult you
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:03.720]  Jack when the serve all Congress had to deliver him a war resolution saying we
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.840]  love the war he said nah I got to you and I don't even need you and then they
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.720]  kind of want to take their ball and go home but that's good see he's being so
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:19.800]  arrogant that oh you want to authorize me I don't need your authorization scum
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:25.760]  they're like what well then we're gonna we're gonna stand up to you so and
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:29.680]  that's what the founders said they said Congress will become corrupt but they
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:33.920]  will get in fights with the president over the power separation powers it's
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:38.880]  beginning right as the tyranny intensifies they begin to fight over
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.120]  the power with each other because the crux and Congress don't want to lose
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:46.160]  their power they want to be able to launch the wars and feel power though
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:52.440]  we'll come back to you more about that stay with us we're on the March the

[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:24.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:29.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:28.240]  very empowering and there's been a lot of corruption going on like roaches
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.000]  behind the walls and under the floorboards for a long time now the
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.520]  roaches have gotten so arrogant that they're climbing on you at night when
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:39.600]  you're sleeping and and biting you you know that'll actually happen with rats
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.120]  if you don't get a rat problem under control I've read the reports they'll

[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:53.720]  on the throat at night and then quickly chew to get the jugglers going and have
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:59.000]  a little meal and that's what it's like we have government rats and corruption
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.720]  climbing all over a sitting in our chairs biting at us the rats have high-tech
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.640]  bull horns telling us lay down lay down gi go along with what we say you don't
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:13.560]  want to be called an extremist this isn't a depression government health care
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:17.880]  if you don't like it you're a racist they just throw these terms at us until
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:22.040]  we recognize that big mega corporations have bought off government and are
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:26.600]  basically eating us out of house and home and it's time to kick the rats out
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:31.480]  and we're going to Max Kaiser here in a moment but it is very exciting news that
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.320]  many Democrats and Republicans are saying the Libya war is a mass murder and
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:39.360]  wrong but a lot of them are saying hey we're for the war but you got to get
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:43.760]  authorization from us and so they're threatening they're suing Obama they're
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.520]  doing all these other things they're threatening to cut the funding off in a
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:53.160]  vote as early as next week and I heard clips on the news this morning again I
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.480]  can listen to TV on my XM flipping through channels going the president is
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:02.000]  not a king or a dictator that's what we'll have if this continues and they
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.120]  would cut from Republican to Democrat from Democrat to Republican saying the
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.480]  same thing and I'm like wow for three months I've been saying Obama's becoming
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:14.440]  a dictator and and then I get these partisan articles written Alex's does
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:19.160]  it like Obama because he's a Republican hey moron I was against all these wars
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.760]  with Bush and just because he got congressional approval for the wars he
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:28.600]  didn't get the full war powers resolution and he lied about WMD's so I'm
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:31.880]  against those wars too okay and see that's what's beautiful about being
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.760]  constitutionalist I'm for property rights I'm for the Second Amendment I'm for
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:39.200]  family rights I'm for states rights I'm against the Patriot Act because it
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.800]  violates the Constitution I'm against foreign entanglements I'm against all
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.840]  these wars see I'm a constitutionalist it's beautiful I've read it I love it it
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:54.060]  makes sense that's what I am I've not seen a document better I want freedom we
[01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:58.600]  should legalize freedom as Ron Paul and others have said got a t-shirt for a
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:02.520]  year legalized freedom with Ron Paul on it get it get it out there the media is
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:06.320]  trying to put out this story now that Ron Paul can't win doesn't matter if he's
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.640]  been number one number two number three in different polls and winning most of
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:14.800]  straw polls they say he can't win just like Rick Perry said it's the law you
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.800]  must take Gardasil turned out there was no law it was a hoax they they engage in
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:24.680]  these hoaxes telling us the moon is made of Velveeta cheese and just because they
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:30.920]  say it doesn't mean it's true and they just try to create a false reality of
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:35.000]  nothing but pure lies like the TSA saying well we're going to Max Kaiser
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.600]  saying back in November we're not gonna pat 12 year olds down anymore and then
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.880]  they said it again in April now they said it again and I was on coast to coast and
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.800]  last night and George is like isn't this good news I said well yeah hopefully
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.960]  they're being pressured to say this hopefully they'll actually do it but it
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.560]  appears to just be a psych warfare tactic by the way we got reporters down at the
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:56.720]  Capitol into the next hour set to cover the vote and the committee hearings and
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.120]  everything's gonna have Aaron Dykes and pop in along with Rob Jacobson coming up
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.840]  and we're going to the illustrious Max Kaiser for the rest of the hour and five

[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:20.200]  from Greece incredible live footage when you were on with us last week with the
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.640]  hundreds of thousands marching you could hear the chanting through your
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:28.920]  hotel windows six floors up the people I've seen polls 98% against the quote
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:34.520]  banker rip off austerity but the gangsters that Goldman Sachs publicly put
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:38.800]  in and the finance and in Prime Minister ship they say we don't care we're
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.880]  going to kill your economy and turn everything over and then as soon as they
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:46.600]  agree to that now we're told the next dominoes are going to fall and then the
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.800]  next and the next and the next and it never fixes the problem because it's
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:56.240]  because these programs aren't failing are they Max they're designed Max to
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:05.040]  always consolidate more power correct the history of Greece going back to 2001
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:11.640]  really it's a great encapsulation of everything that has happened over the
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.760]  past 10 to 15 years to destroy various economies I should mention that when we
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:20.720]  were in Athens you know we're making this film and we got incredible footage
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.160]  Alex that we're saving for the film it should be out in the first two weeks of
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:29.920]  July Stacy Herbert my partner you know she was really out in the front line
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:35.320]  braving the tear gas getting the footage we got footage of basically cops
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:40.720]  dressed up like anarchists you know Asian provocateurs beating people up and
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:46.200]  this is a recurring trend all over Europe and Spain and in Greece these
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:51.000]  provocateurs that are basically cops that are beating people up to try to make
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.440]  these otherwise peaceful violent demonstrations violent we got great
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:59.560]  footage so this film is going to be exciting but the history of what's
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:04.960]  happened in Greece if you go back to 2001 of course when they entered the
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:13.200]  Euro it was at the because of the their books were cooked the Golden Sacks came
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:19.800]  in and they hid debt that Greece had on their books so they could be part of the
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:25.040]  Euro and it was at that moment that Greece was set up to fail and ever since
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:29.720]  that moment it's been a tragic story of a country being destroyed by outside
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:35.240]  bankers so now you've got a situation where just last year the country signed
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:41.720]  what's called the memorandum with what's called the Troika which is the IMF ECB
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:49.400]  EU which gives them rights to the assets that are owned by Greece completely
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:54.000]  outside of what is guaranteed in their Constitution so the IMF has gone
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.760]  completely around the Constitution and they have committed this and now they've
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:05.120]  got these lawsuits you talked to Dr. Tobros who's suing Golden Sacks and the
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.160]  Greek government for doing things like sign the memorandum and also they sold
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:17.360]  these credit default swaps back in 2009 Papandreia the Prime Minister sold the
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:21.800]  credit default swaps that were on the books of the postal the postal office
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:27.400]  postal service for 1.2 billion to his cronies and then six months later they
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.600]  flipped them for 27 billion now if they had that 20 billion right now they
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.400]  wouldn't be in this hot water so the Papandreia was caught red-handed
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.240]  committing an act of fraud and every single step of the way
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:43.760]  Goldman Sachs has been making huge fees well I mean he was caught getting him
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.120]  into fraudulent debt buying in the to the derivatives and as you say engaging
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:52.400]  in financial terrorism he should be arrested immediately and those prominent
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:56.440]  lawyers and members of parliament that you got on the show this last week they
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:01.160]  agreed with that so so so where is all this headed I mean not just in Greece but
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.040]  but now and we played a clip earlier from the EU parliament where they were
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:08.800]  debating the fact that every time they bail something out it only gets worse
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.280]  because it's designed to do that so so next it's Italy were told net then
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:18.240]  Portugal and then and then and then into France and into England into the US I
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.160]  mean we just have to give everything to these crooks and they're bleeding the
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.480]  country they're bleeding the country to death and I also mentioned you know when
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:29.360]  I was there Steve Forbes is there with the International Chamber of Commerce
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.360]  and they're already openly discussing carving up the country selling the
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:37.080]  lottery selling the pork selling the infrastructure selling the roads outside
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:41.080]  bankers and that was their intention all along and in fact the bankers use the
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:45.480]  assets of the country is collateral to line up more loans to take over the
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:50.160]  country remember the IMF itself is bankrupt the IMF has no money the IMF is
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:53.920]  bankrupt they had to use the collateral of Greece to line up the loans
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.000]  necessary to take the country over it's like a lever to buy out on Wall Street
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.200]  except now that instead of taking over another company using their company's
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:07.480]  assets for the collateral to get the money to buy it they're using a country's
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:12.120]  assets to borrow the money to take it over every single step of the way the
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:16.520]  Wall Street banks have made a profit so the bond here's the interesting thing and
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.240]  I want you to think about this for a second because it's a real insight into
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:24.960]  the psychosis that is driving Wall Street in the global economy the the
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.400]  European banks that own Greek bonds of course they're gonna lose money but the
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:34.920]  Wall Street banks who sold insurance on the bonds are gonna lose more money and
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:39.160]  who's one of the biggest losers of course Goldman Sachs so why would
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:43.960]  Goldman Sachs sell itself products that they themselves are gonna lose billions
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:48.560]  of dollars on because they know that if they need to they can go to Congress and
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:52.840]  get another bailout and this is the psychosis of the Wall Street mentality
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:57.920]  they simply rape and pillage and whenever they get into trouble they go to
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:01.360]  Congress and they get another and they run around financing all these fake
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:07.200]  libertarians that give it a bad name and and say it's free market when it's big
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:12.560]  mega banks and brokerage firms going and doing deals they know we're gonna go
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.720]  belly up making money on the way up then getting a bailout on the way down and
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:20.840]  then telling us we've got to bail them out it's the free market the free market
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:25.880]  would not just be let them lose their their you know what's but also arrest
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:31.320]  them for fraud I mean I mean if I lie on my taxes which is paid to the private
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:34.840]  Federal Reserve the income tax doesn't go to run the country they will throw me
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:39.240]  in prison you know if I was to lie about $5,000 and they caught me these
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:44.360]  crooks have internal emails as you know a timber wolf and other things calling
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:48.960]  their customers idiot scum and you know we're gonna sell them the bleeper and
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:55.520]  ha ha ha I mean these are just criminals and and I know you worked with
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:02.160]  these people I mean we need to quite frankly get a 1776 situation through
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:07.040]  the courts going and haul them up and turn loose all the pot smokers out of
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.160]  prison and and throw these people in jail I mean we got room for hundreds of
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:14.800]  thousands of these brokers that have engaged in crimes to slap them in
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:23.120]  prison well yeah they are criminality has become America's number one GDP
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:27.920]  booster if it wasn't for fraud and financial crimes America would have no
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:33.040]  GDP at all they barely have a GDP now but it's but the entire country now is
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:37.080]  run on Ponzi schemes and frauds they're like for example the bailout of
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:41.240]  General Motors that's turned out to be another huge Ponzi scheme and fraud
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:45.160]  Obama points to that as a success story well the company the company is
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:49.520]  already failing again there there's stuffing the pipeline with inventory
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.520]  that can't possibly you said that a year ago and it came out earlier in the
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:56.640]  week headlines in the Wall Street Journal that there was fraud in the
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:00.440]  numbers at the White House released I mean that's obvious but I just digressing
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:03.480]  for a moment I want to get your take on the constitutional crisis some good
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:06.560]  things are now happening I said it could be as early as next week I have to
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:11.800]  correct myself they voted about 30 minutes ago House votes no on continuing
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:16.520]  Obama's war in Libya that's associated press meanwhile top Democrat
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:21.320]  representative now this is from the Hill says that Obama has become an
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:27.400]  absolute monarch that that's a quote is quote becoming an absolute monarch from
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:33.640]  representative Gerald Nadler the self-propelled German Zeppelin said
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:39.720]  Congress must act to limit funding for military operations in Libya to order
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:45.880]  correct the the trend and the media is reporting this is a total route for the
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:50.160]  warmonger in chief what's happening with all these pro-um globalist lovers
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:56.360]  suddenly turning against turning against our Messiah Lord Obama well because
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:59.720]  they don't like spending the money but I don't think they're gonna have any
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:06.080]  success overturning the Obama doctrine because he's got Wall Street in his
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:09.720]  pocket and he's got the hedge funds in his pocket they're gonna fund his
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:13.880]  reelection campaign and in exchange hold on is that a French police car let me
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:30.360]  hear that are they coming to arrest you like they're outside your apartment or
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.800]  your house I think they're coming for donations for their annual Christmas
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:50.520]  party okay Lord Kaiser I mean what do you mean I mean a week ago people wouldn't
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.640]  believe Congress was stand up to Obama I mean I mean Congress has a 9% approval
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:58.400]  rating the public's waking up I'm seeing a lot of a lot of positive things
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:06.600]  happen to crash the market you know two years ago the underbush they use the
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:10.760]  color-coded terror alert every time you needed to get something done he say oh
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:14.920]  my god it's a red alert everyone jump under the bed and by the way we've got
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:19.480]  to pass them our legislation now what Obama with his relationship with Wall
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.800]  Street when they need to they crash the market and everyone gets totally frightened
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.600]  by this and that's admitted that's admitted I mean the cybersecurity is
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:31.160]  launching cyber attacks against themselves like stuck snap and then
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:36.560]  openly using that to try to take over the internet right because it's a
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:41.160]  fantastic tool to be able to you know they instill fear in the people the
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:46.200]  masses anytime you want by by a market collapse and this scares everybody to
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.440]  death and they have this ability now so I don't think anyone's gonna be able to
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:55.160]  stop Obama because he in the hedge fund that created this kind of neo hedge fund
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:59.080]  fascism why don't you just roll over then hold on why don't you just go to the
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:03.800]  local French cemetery and crawl into a grave their max I mean the yeah let's
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:06.960]  not be defeatist we're starting to identify the banksters thanks to your
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.800]  great work and many others and our listeners taking action and I see us
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:15.200]  gaining ground every day what do you mean we're not able to stop this scumbag
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.200]  believing believing and you can win is half the battle speaking of French
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:25.040]  cemeteries there's one not far from where I live where they have all the bodies
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:31.200]  buried that suffered the decapitation during the reign of terror and so there's
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:35.120]  their famous names are buried there that should be a lesson to all your bankers
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:41.200]  if you push the people too far you know you're playing with fire and historically
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:44.720]  this is what happens and I see it happening on the ground in happens
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.080]  Alex I see it in Dublin I see it all across Europe I think we're going to
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:51.960]  Madrid next the folks are basically they don't want to parse through the
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:55.520]  bureaucracy and try to read the bills anymore they're just going to get the
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:59.520]  guillotine out of storage and start lopping heads off and let God figure
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:02.480]  it out because they've had it they've they're completely at the end of their
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:07.800]  tether there's no more fudging about here the people are absolutely at the end
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:12.040]  of the line they are they realize the austerity measures are cooked up just to
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:16.760]  pay banker bonuses there's no legitimate economic reason for it it's wholesale
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:21.120]  robbery it's a financial rape and it's all short term because watching even EU
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.120]  debates and reading European papers they admit this austerity measure will wreck
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:29.560]  Greece even more or even long term they won't even be able to be milked anymore
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:33.840]  and so they're going to kill the economy short term to to feed their
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:43.520]  greeting us max max stay there I want to come back with you on because you're
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.520]  there in Europe and you just let Greece and they're now saying oh Italy's the
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.840]  next to fall I thought it was going to be Portugal now they're saying Italy has
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.360]  got to give everything over to the bankers we know the Italians aren't
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.920]  going to do that I mean I love the Italians folks statistically they're the
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:00.120]  biggest tax cheats in the world it's just don't do what the government tells

[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:20.040]  hey this is another guy Jim Morrison is over there in a French grave right now
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:25.080]  hey Max Kaiser look you're a smart guy and so much what you've said is
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:28.200]  unfolding come true with great precision that's why we have you on but you were
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:32.000]  an Obama supporter early on and you know some folks thought I was a cook for
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.320]  saying I was gonna sell everybody out I could look at his advisors but I'm here
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:38.560]  to tell you I don't think he's gonna win re-election and I don't think the
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:42.920]  Republicans that are gonna try to neocon and finagle things are gonna get away
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:49.520]  with anything more and more the evidence is showing day by day week by week that
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:54.520]  that there is a major awakening across the board right now so I'm saying have
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:59.280]  faith my friend have faith my friend exciting things are happening Texas is
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:03.040]  set to vote today but I heard a bunch of senators didn't show up during the
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:07.760]  special session so they can abstain our crews down there right now and gonna be
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:13.160]  reporting on it for us so so they can play games to stall for a while but like
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.560]  you said in Europe you know with one hand you take it the other you you know
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:20.400]  give back Max you're you're saying folks aren't putting up with it anymore in
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:25.840]  Europe yeah no you're right I did give Obama the benefit of the doubt and I
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:30.840]  thought your film the Obama deception you know it was the only real piece of
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:35.320]  filmmaking out there at the time that was going you know it's so much in the
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.240]  other direction and now it's turned out to be absolutely correct it was a
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:44.240]  complete con job it was a complete deception and you know it's highly
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:47.480]  disappointing but I when people mentioned I live here in France I live in
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:50.960]  Europe when people mentioned President Obama the first thought that goes through
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:55.880]  my head is my god he's still president he kind of they can't believe that the
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:01.640]  guy is still in the White House but I think that he will marshal the forces
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:07.000]  of his hedge fund supporters who pull the strings of the economy and they will
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.720]  pull some fast tricks when they need to and I don't think that there's any you
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:16.520]  know and they built by Ron Paul I mean Ron Paul obviously would be a fantastic
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:19.920]  presidential candidate but he's constantly marginalized by mainstream
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.480]  media he's constantly not counted on straw polls as a winner even though he
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.880]  always is the winner so they're firmly in control so I don't but I could be
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:35.040]  wrong again I mean I was obviously wrong during the first election cycle so
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.200]  could be wrong I'm not I'm not here saying you're wrong I mean I understand
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.080]  you know the overall pessimism and then they are playing every dirty trick in
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:47.840]  the book on Ron Paul but Ron Paul again is there knowing he's taken one for the
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:53.000]  team to inject real issues so we win long term whether he wins the election or
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.040]  wins a nomination or not but but shifting gears back to the question I
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:02.120]  brought up before the break obviously the contagion is spreading it was always
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:06.760]  designed to do this now we're told it's Italy about to go into receivership not
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:11.840]  Portugal what's your take on that I mean how is this looting financial
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:18.760]  terrorism where will they strike next well my grand theory of all of this of
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:23.920]  course whether you're talking about any of the so-called pigs Portugal Ireland
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:32.080]  Italy Greece or Spain the me the big player in all this is Germany you know
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:38.520]  Germany has a extraordinary successful economy huge export market they've got
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:43.160]  the great growth in their employment and of course after World War two they were
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:48.320]  split into two parts when the euro came along they were allowed to unify but
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:53.080]  only in the context of the many-country euro but now that the euro is splitting
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:58.840]  up you say Alex the possibility of a reunified Germany that separates from
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:03.280]  everybody else in Europe is quite real now you've got a superpower with their
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:07.160]  own bank their own currency the strongest economy in the world no you're
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:11.640]  right Merkel Merkel almost lost a reelection of the Parliamentary because
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:14.760]  the last bailout was so unpopular they're not gonna get away with another
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:18.720]  one Deutschland's gonna break aren't they I mean they're gonna pull out as long
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:24.520]  when the euro is cheap their exports boom so it's a game they talk up the
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:28.680]  crisis in the peripheral countries because they want to get the euro
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:33.160]  cheap but even even trying to talk the euro down like Germany does to help their
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:37.520]  export business the euro is still there Kaiser let's do five more minutes with

[02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:02.640]  could hold max over with Bob who knows but let's go ahead now and talk to Matt
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:08.720]  in Texas Matt you're on the air go ahead thanks for taking my call Alex well
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:12.400]  you said you wanted to call us to calling and talk about the economic
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:16.000]  meltdowns that are happening everywhere in the constant de-evaluation of our
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.280]  dollar and the year-old honey and I just my question is more of a piece of advice
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:26.920]  you can say my I'm only 20 years old my parents are planning to invest quite a
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:31.640]  bit of money in me to go to a major university and I'm starting to tell them
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:35.320]  what for is it for engineering or something because if it's not something
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.600]  technical in my opinion it's not going to be worth very much unless you were the
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:42.600]  absolute top of your class and still it could be a problem I mean well what do
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:47.480]  you want to go to college for actually it's um it's for art well not for art
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:52.880]  it's the Berkeley College of Music in Boston Max Kaiser what's your advice to
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.160]  this fellow well he was asking I think the question was going to be about some
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:02.200]  kind of investment or something right not about college no I think he said
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:06.480]  they're gonna invest money to send me to college what is your question Matt well
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:11.080]  I was just like I said it was kind of a piece of advice that I guess you guys
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:15.400]  can give me because um seeing that the world is you know going the way it is
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:20.560]  and talks are being have a major economic depression I was just wondering
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.720]  in your honest opinion if you think it would be in vain a waste of money to go
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:29.200]  to a you know a college for arts yeah that was the question he asked Max so
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:35.000]  back to the question yeah I would think the best thing to do would be to spend
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.240]  a few years outside of the United States to get a more of a global picture of
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:46.280]  what's you know going on and to get some skills in intercultural kind of
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.840]  communication and things of that nature yeah I mean are you an oil painter or
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:53.440]  something give yourself a weird name claim that you love the world government
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:56.640]  and then you'll get giant government grants to make millions of dollars call
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.040]  yourself wiggly by gootoo or something and say you hate freedom in the Second
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.960]  Amendment they'll go 10 million 50 million 100 million you'll just be
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:13.200]  rolling in cash I thank you I'm sorry sir go ahead in the US they for the next
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:18.240]  five ten years it's going to be continuously a drip drip drip economic
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:23.000]  collapse and so that's a total bore I'd rather go to a country that is already
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:28.120]  collapsed like Greece or Iceland where things have collapsed already and you
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:32.280]  can participate in the upswing see be be part of it or go to Brazil you know
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:35.600]  Brazil is a company that's a country that's a booming it goes somewhere where
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.160]  things are booming but around the US for five years and listen to everyone
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:45.080]  complain about how bad things are it's not a good way to spend your 20s okay
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:49.560]  David or Matt I hope that answer must call the list is changing I think that
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:55.680]  was who was I just talking to Alex I wanted to thank your listeners by the
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:00.440]  way oh yeah what are you gonna make the pirate the film thing that you
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:08.120]  advertised Alex in the rabbit hole the film that we made in Greece we raised
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:13.840]  the entire 4500 budget from people who listen to our shows through you know
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:18.640]  giving us five and ten dollars a piece on my site pirate my film and they've
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:23.160]  already now we've already financed half of the next film that we're gonna shoot
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:28.640]  in Spain so this is called crowdfunding so the crowd each kicks in a few bucks
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:33.320]  and then we go make the film and then when we release it on to YouTube it's
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:37.760]  completely without any copyright whatsoever it's copyright free media so
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:42.320]  we release it freely into the media anyone can download it we want people to

[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:06.880]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:11.920]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:15.520]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turning members
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:20.560]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:25.960]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:30.840]  the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:35.240]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:20.840]  Well the globalist Hydra is sucking grease down in the water to share the
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:28.400]  population. CBC television is admitting that last year at the G20 G8 summit in
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.880]  Toronto police did pose as demonstrators to engage basically in
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:36.480]  criminal activity so they could then attack the general demonstrators and
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:41.200]  have a billion dollars in police funding and security funding they were caught a
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:48.000]  few years before that in Montabello and then bordering the capital city there of
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.360]  Ottawa and they noticed that all the anarchists had police boots and they
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:56.240]  would have the anarchist attack cops people noticed those anarchists are all
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:59.600]  wearing the same boots turned out it was the police-issued boot with a little
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:05.960]  yellow logo on the heel and the people ran up said your cops your cops and so
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:09.320]  the police suddenly ran the anarchist and got them behind the police line and
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:14.120]  people videotaped him and the CMP had to admit they do that I mean folks if you
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:19.120]  try to build a veteran whose house they bulldoze a new home they'll send cops in
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:22.640]  trying to get you to blow stuff up I mean they don't want citizens doing Jack
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:27.200]  Squad because the government is a mafia before I get into the economy your phone
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:32.800]  calls the huge news absolutely huge developments Congress just about an hour
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:39.320]  ago the House voted no on continuing Obama's war in Libya we've also got top
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:45.240]  Democrat representative and president is an absolute monarch and just a lot of
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:50.240]  really exciting exciting things are happening as people admit the level of
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:54.880]  tyranny we're facing but I wanted to talk to Bob Chapman formerly with
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:58.360]  military intelligence and then at the biggest private silver and gold brokerage
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:03.040]  firm and put out the Gary Allen report in the book an undercaller conspiracy
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:07.240]  even fighting for close to 50 years against the global crime syndicate and
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:12.080]  unfortunately stuff he talked about 40 years ago has come true now I wanted to
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:19.120]  talk about cases of people like Whitey Bolger now supposedly caught he's
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:22.840]  really been in a quasi witness protection program there's horrible
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:27.160]  murdering gangster who of course we later learned work for the FBI was
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:32.000]  protected by them that's how they control organized crime is by first
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.480]  telling us it didn't exist back in the 50s and then once the public wised up to
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:40.800]  that selectively busting certain groups it's why they made alcohol illegal was
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.320]  to make more profits in prohibition it's why they made narcotics illegal
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:49.660]  criminals want things illegal so there's a black market and and now how many
[02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:54.800]  CIA aircraft have crashed how many mega banks have been caught with hundreds
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:58.900]  of billions in laundered money and running the drug aircraft and I remember
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:05.260]  Celica Stillo DEA agent almost six years ago on the show saying that Los
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:08.760]  Zettis is CIA funded they tried to hire me to train them there's gonna be a new
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:13.120]  war in Mexico as they shut down their competition over the 500 billion a year
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:18.440]  and narcotics coming through Mexico alone Indian the rest of North America
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:23.840]  Canada the US and other points is delivered through and then he said a
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:28.560]  couple years ago before they set him up put him in prison that they're they're
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:33.880]  shipping guns to Mexico destabilize things and he knew because he was a gun
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:39.840]  dealer and they tried to recruit him to train Los Zettis as he done in Latin
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:43.880]  America training other groups and he went to prison well now it all comes out
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:48.400]  the last few months operation fast and furious the ATF's been caught lying to
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:51.400]  Congress the head of the ATF saying they didn't know it turns out they had
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:57.000]  cameras shipping them they ordered the whole thing just as ATF officers went
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.920]  public a few months ago risking their lives I'm here to tell you the ATF is a
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:06.360]  real mafia the most criminal federal agency I know of that's in a group of CIA
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:11.000]  and FBI people but again it's all compartmentalized the good guys they
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:14.320]  compartmentalized and kind of low-level work the bad guys get promoted at the
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:20.520]  top and this came out with a whitey bulger that he was paying 25% of the
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:25.360]  hundreds of millions he made running the Irish mob on the east coast to the FBI
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:29.760]  and even setting up people in his own organization for snacks that's what the
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:34.360]  FBI calls it when they wanted bigger cuts they burned their own people and
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:38.000]  bulger would act like he didn't know it was happening to his Irish brotherhood
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.680]  it's the same thing with the Italian mafia all these mafias so I wanted to
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:44.960]  get Bob Chapman's take on that because when you've got investors business
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:49.520]  daily this is very exciting I talked about this in the first hour headline was
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:54.560]  fast and furious a gun control plot well we have the answer to that a detailed
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:57.120]  report going back to our previous reports today
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:03.160]  Obama administration caught running false flag against Second Amendment so this
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:08.440]  is super super important news and this link the eight-page article by Watson
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:13.640]  needs to get out to everybody because the ATF was gonna get abolished in 93 so
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:18.680]  they pulled off that whole Waco thing that you know we have extremists we
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:21.720]  got to deal with and then it was footage them loading their cameras saying oh
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:25.880]  we've got to demonize you know these people to get more funding haha this is
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:30.000]  gonna be great pulled up open fire had the whole thing planned from the
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.760]  beginning the Davidians fought back when the ATF put their hands up the
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:38.160]  Davidians stopped if they shot a bunch of men women and children not saying the
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:42.640]  Davidians were perfect they were a little weird most of it was made up and the
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:47.240]  ATFs ran off like cowards and went and got the military and others and came back
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:50.440]  and burned the place down and they had Delta Force they're shooting everybody
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:53.960]  and that even came out congressional hearings Delta Force quote pulling
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:57.040]  triggers I don't need that report to tell me that I've got the flare footage of
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:02.440]  them behind the Bradley's in classic infantry fashion with them allows bigger
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:05.800]  saying come out during the fire when the Davidians ran out some of them with
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:09.760]  kids they double tapped them and then would run over with tanks and like run
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:14.280]  over that baby a couple times to the American enemy and then they had the
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:18.280]  rest of kids hiding out little concrete church records vault Delta Force went in
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:22.480]  put that bomb right on the roof shot in there with that shape charge splattered
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:27.020]  them into soup and it was just posing with skulls Delta Force and the Army
[02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:32.080]  the tank drivers they had the skulls and took photos the ATF had skulls on their
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:37.040]  desk ah nothing like bagging an American not a lot killing a one-year-old baby
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:42.240]  ooh raw and then folks got upset about that these real men did so the ATF was
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:44.600]  even admitted on a discovery channel they said it was a coincidence I've
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:48.560]  cooked a rider truck with fuel oil six months before and tested it out the
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:51.920]  desert and when local cops found out about that in Oklahoma city well they
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:55.520]  had to be killed of course got Colonel Craig Roberts coming on talk about that
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:59.880]  next week but I'm sorry Bob I'm now digressing I was just getting into how
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:03.240]  organized crime really works and who really runs it at the end of the day you
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:06.840]  find out Wall Street gets all almost all the money and then they even own the
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:10.760]  private prisons that when they catch you using their drugs at the retail level
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:14.640]  they put you in the prison working for 25 cents an hour competing with everybody
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:18.600]  else's jobs and the good old boys they all love it even though they're losing
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:21.400]  their jobs Bob Chapman is that an accurate boil down to what we're dealing
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:30.160]  with here it certainly is and I I came from Boston and I knew Whitey Bolger
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:32.920]  when I was the teenager that's why I raised it you told me that about a
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:38.200]  decade ago please continue and he belonged to a group they called the
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:43.560]  Winter Hill gang and my mom and dad grew up in Winter Hill and it just so
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.160]  happens that they were growing up there was another fellow who lived across the
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:54.240]  street from my mom and his name was Ponzi and he eventually moved to New
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:59.840]  Jersey it was quite a colorful section it was very poor Italian Irish Greek it
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:04.960]  you know the melting pot so to speak I know I didn't know that that the famous
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:09.720]  Ponzi scheme guy I grew up your neighborhood that well it was in there
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:16.880]  yeah yeah yeah yeah and but anyway I knew Whitey and he was just another
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:23.400]  criminal and there were lots of kids like that and he went to prison and he
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:30.160]  got trained well there and he became a real pro the the program that they set
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:38.280]  up with the FBI Conley who's now in prison the FBI agent who I guess what
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:45.760]  you would call him as handler they finally caught him in the crossfire we'll
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:51.400]  call it but the whole thing was an FBI operation and this used to happen all
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:54.720]  the time oh yeah they only busted it when the state police got sick of them
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:58.720]  killing cops so they went ahead and busted him and so then they spirited
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:02.440]  him off let him go into a secret witness protection program why do you think
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:06.960]  they're busting him now they knew where he was all along Bob and that's right
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:12.480]  and I I think the whole thing got long in the truth I look like idiots because
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:20.000]  I couldn't find him and you know the easy excuses he was with a woman and they
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:26.680]  didn't change their pattern of life and so they were easy to take down I mean
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:30.160]  if you're having to look for people and there are people in Idaho to how to do
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:35.120]  that and I do you know I pretty good at the government taught me well yeah
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:42.360]  you're hiding out well I always am because you know I get down the
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:46.960]  brass tacks and I've been threatened by the government before and I believe them
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:50.760]  that's right we don't we don't call you you call us and every time from a
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:53.800]  different number we don't even we're not you're in a nice third-world country
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:59.200]  right now Bob but but Bob now that's because all the stuff they tried to do
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:03.920]  to you you you you have escaped their orbit for now but but I interrupt you
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:08.960]  let's get back to whitey bulger and and and the FBI operation and how they
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:12.200]  flush just one of the mid-level guys but it's admitted money going right up to
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:17.800]  the top but again we were told the Costa Nostra doesn't exist well that's right
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:26.160]  it didn't exist that my father's brother belonging to the Costa Nostra and he was
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:29.800]  the biggest bookmaker in Boston of course it was illegal in those days and
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:39.520]  now it's legal and so it's okay but I'm very familiar with both sides of the
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:45.280]  fence and when I was 16 I decided both sides of the fence being the Italian and
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:52.000]  the Irish quite frankly I'm half Irish and half Italian and and so I decided
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.320]  at 16 years old that I didn't want to get involved in that life and I did very
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:01.800]  very well in school and I turned out to be somebody else and I'm very very
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:05.920]  happy because many of the people who I grew up with who continued in that
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:12.880]  lifestyle you know they're in their 70s now and they're very unhappy that they
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:17.920]  didn't try it another way and so for all of you listening
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:22.760]  believe me crime does not pay unfortunately the crime is not only
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:30.800]  committed by criminals but criminals in banking Wall Street Washington corporate
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:35.800]  America and lots of other places too stay there Bob I want to get back into
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:41.000]  from your research living around this as a young person then being in

[02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:07.400]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:11.440]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:15.360]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:19.360]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:23.920]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:28.560]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:32.320]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:35.760]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:39.720]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:19.840]  and others then we'll get into the economy the pigs the European nations
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:25.960]  of the hogs the groups they said they're gonna slaughter next and I got a bunch
[02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:30.160]  of other news we haven't even gotten to yet but finishing up with Bob on that
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:35.640]  whole point of organized crime looking at the architecture do you agree with my
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:39.520]  historical analysis that many others agree I mean well it's on record really
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:49.360]  that that that crime syndicates run by the big mega banks the robber barons
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:54.960]  many of which were openly involved in opium importation cocaine all of it they
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:58.440]  just made it all illegal because they can make a hundred times the profit off
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:02.000]  of it and this is the big elephant in the living room this is the big giant
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:07.160]  fraud and of course the ATF is shipping guns down to Mexico to track them back
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:13.080]  here and blame the Second Amendment of course government is running and
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:17.680]  controlling the mafias and deciding who who rises and who falls I mean how many
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:22.840]  examples do we have to get Bob what's your view on that well they have to keep
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:29.440]  on trying because what they've done is relatively unsuccessful a good example
[02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:34.920]  is the war an ectotics war along the border with Mexico and in a couple of
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:42.440]  other places in Mexico as well and the whole thing is all about people in
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:48.680]  Mexico and the CIA taking over the drug operations that's really what it's
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:54.480]  about and this election coming up in about a year and a half in Mexico and
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:26:00.320]  the House and the Senate are both controlled by pre which is the party
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:07.360]  is not in the presidency presently and they will win the presidency that's
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:13.400]  why things work there and that whole thing will be simmered down because the
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:18.080]  other group that's coming in doesn't want that kind of thing going on the
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:23.040]  thing being the warfare you know innocent people get killed and I live in
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:32.800]  Mexico so I know what it's all about as far as the the bankers look you can't
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:38.520]  have any kind of an operation without having a bank to transfer money to put
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:43.560]  your money into these are the people who would behind the whole thing these are
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:49.560]  the people make it work and from time to time you see the city group and now
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:54.640]  it's Wachovia and you know every once in a while four or five years I'll take
[02:26:54.640 --> 02:27:01.240]  down a major bank that they say a launded $250 billion and they'll find
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:06.720]  them $5 billion and they'll all go away yeah well Fargo was 376 billion they
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:15.200]  paid a $100 million fine that's 0.3% Bob and you get to keep 275 billion it's
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:22.400]  just like Goldman Sachs they pay to find and didn't admit nor deny to the SCC pay
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:28.400]  to find the 770 million I think the figure was and they stole five billion
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:36.320]  so they got to keep four billion and and this this character this fellow the
[02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:45.400]  Oracle of Omaha he in his his company and they cheated the US government in taxes
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:50.800]  the 300 million and they made a deal with the SCC we'll pay 100 million we
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:55.280]  keep the other two and they said okay and that's because over the years they've
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:59.840]  gotten their alumni into all the regulatory positions and so the sky is
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:04.320]  the limit but at a certain point they destroy the golden goose that lays to
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:08.840]  the golden golden eggs Bob and that brings me to the next point what's
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:12.520]  your view on the latest developments in Greece and now it spreading as we knew
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:17.320]  it was designed to to Italy from my research I know you've been over there
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:20.240]  and lived over there as well the Italians are not gonna go along with
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:23.960]  austerity they're gonna even be more not just violent the streets they're gonna
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:30.080]  do a lot of dirty tricks and things to not pay Goldman Sachs money they don't
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:35.920]  know that's right and I think Max has probably told you on his programs with
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:44.480]  you that he and and some attorneys in Greece have bought a lawsuit or are
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:48.640]  going to bring a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs and I think that's wonderful
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:57.880]  and now Senate 11's committee has put out I don't know hundreds and hundreds of
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:05.440]  pages of testimony and they forced the Justice Department to go after Goldman
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:11.440]  Sachs whether they'll bring criminal indictments remains to be seen but I
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:18.520]  think there's a possibility that they will and that would blow it upside down
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:22.920]  well I mean it's something's got to give because Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:28.080]  city bank others that they're not slowing down on any of this they're
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:32.800]  actually going faster now and I guess it's just their nature they just can't
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:38.520]  help themselves can they Bob this is the last profit opportunity before they
[02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:44.320]  take the system down and then on top of that launched the new global carbon tax
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:47.680]  system we're gonna come back with your phone calls and get into a host of other
[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:56.320]  news stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:21.760]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:26.080]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:29.840]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four

[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:50.440]  cold a CD burn it to disk give it to people the live video streams of the
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:35:01.800]  show prisonplanet.tv also Nemo's got a big report out where the CNBC not CNBC
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:06.720]  that's that's in the U.S. that's the business channel MSNBC CBC the big
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:10.720]  Canadian broadcasting system is admitted in government documents that the police
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:14.120]  were infiltrating and attacking crowds so they could go after the general
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:18.000]  public governments do this everywhere folks and that's a form of false flag
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.760]  just like Obama's been caught shipping guns into Mexico we told you this before
[02:35:22.760 --> 02:35:27.800]  it was in the news years before they even did and I always respected
[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:31.280]  Celica Stilow but now I really realize why they set him up and put him in
[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:36.400]  prison because he told us all of this and that's in Paul Watson's big report
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:39.840]  and I haven't gotten to this today I didn't get to it yesterday and I'm
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:45.440]  really a bad person at a certain level for not I mean I feel guilty that's not
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:50.640]  a joke when I say I feel like a bad person he because I can never cover it
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:54.720]  all because I cover subjects in depth and there's too many to cover this is a
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:00.440]  huge in fact it did we print the study because I want to put this on screen
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:04.760]  right as the show ends today if you go into Paul's article the first link is
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:09.840]  to the study it's a prestigious study that the government knows that the
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:13.600]  United States has the highest vaccine level in the world and has gone from
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:18.720]  the lowest infant mortality rate in the world to the highest in the
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:22.240]  industrialized world and way behind a bunch of third world countries we have
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:26.240]  more babies die than any other country in the world in any other industrialized
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:31.840]  nation in any third world and then it's the vaccines I mean this is a big
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:35.680]  report and I should have been talking about this quite frankly because getting
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:40.600]  fluoride out of the water not get stopping GMO not taking vaccines that's
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:45.560]  something we can actually do that's something we can actually do stopping
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:50.400]  smoking something we can actually do you know these are things where we can
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:55.480]  really do something now and great job Watson yesterday writing that and go
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:37:01.280]  into the big prestigious medical general report and it hadn't gotten the
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:04.640]  mainstream media attention it needs and so we need to cover that we're going

[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:55.520]  erfood.com okay Bob I got a bunch of stuff we're running out of time here I'm
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:58.760]  tempted to go into overdrive but then that's internet only and makes our
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:02.600]  AM and FM affiliates angry because they say we'll just do four hours and we'll
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:06.880]  carry it I understand that but I hogishly started doing four hours for a few
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:10.920]  years but I've got to have time in there to do the TV show we're launching then I
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:15.840]  want to continue with the news it's a catch 22 but after we take five or six
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:19.800]  calls here what are some of the other issues you think are most important you
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:24.600]  know let's plant the hook there so folks know what's coming up well I think the
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:32.040]  situation in Europe is the first order of the day and I guess it's this coming
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:40.160]  Tuesday they're going to have an election referendum vote in the House in
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:47.320]  the Senate particularly the House on accepting the terms of the offering that's
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:51.600]  made by been made by the EU the banks and the IMF and I don't think they're
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:57.360]  going to accept it and as you said trouble starting in Italy and we just saw
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:02.080]  the films over the last couple of weeks what went on in Spain particularly the
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:09.240]  police brutality was awful and and so it's a cauldron throughout Europe of
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:14.760]  unemployment low living standards and that's going to spread throughout the
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:18.560]  whole European Union and it's not going to get a better it's going to get worse
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:23.800]  just like we're experiencing in America and there are some countries that have
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:28.920]  been spared chilly because they had an earthquake but other than that they're
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:36.240]  doing well Brazil as Max mentioned earlier in Canada and even Mexico with
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:41.400]  its problems along the border are doing well but the most of the world has got
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:50.040]  problems including China and so it's going to be a grinding grinding situation
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:59.800]  for years and how long I don't know but I you know I remember you and I and
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:05.440]  Paul Craig Roberts were on and this is a couple of years ago and you said well I
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:10.480]  think it probably will happen in the next six months and Paul Craig Roberts and
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:16.000]  I both said no it's gonna take longer and nothing ever is done as quickly as you
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  think even though you clearly can see what the future is offering us and these
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.600]  people in charge are not dumb and they're gonna try to drag this thing out as
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:32.280]  long as possible and it's gonna get lower and lower and lower in living
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:36.720]  standards along the way yeah that was in October of 2008 it was so bad I was
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:40.960]  like my gosh they're talking about martial law but it is true they like to
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:46.120]  slowly bleed us kind of like a vampire sneaking up to the bedside at night and
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:51.280]  chewing on your feet or or you know mosquito giving you some deadening
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:55.720]  while it sucks the blood and that's the inside baseball they're backing off on
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:41:59.240]  oil prices right now because they you know they take two steps forward but when
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:04.360]  we resist they step back a foot or even two and and Bob do you agree that really
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:08.960]  that the awakening is a great bounty right now and that more and more of the
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:14.280]  globalist who had been pretty much invincible are beginning to stumble more
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:18.840]  and more and Jim Tucker's Intel which is always proven to be flawless directly
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:22.320]  from Bilderberg is that they are panicking and scared and more and more
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:26.120]  they don't have a Midas touch everything they turn everything they touch
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:31.960]  turns into a pile of steaming now horse done well you said not too long ago
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:37.280]  we're breathing down their collar and we are I mean the things that we've
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:41.800]  accomplished in Europe and informing people nevermind in America has been
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:48.600]  colossal especially in Greece and Max has been over there in person and and done
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:53.800]  a great deal to make people understand the situation and this is spreading and
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:59.200]  we're doing our job we're doing a good job and if we do it good enough we're
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:03.200]  gonna stop these people and they are frightened and they are being pushed to
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:06.640]  do things they don't want to do quickly and already well let's go to the calls
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:11.360]  but I'll just add this little caveat to all of that people get mad and they tend
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:20.120]  to start losing faith when they see poll after poll or Ron Paul wins straw
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:23.960]  polls and then he's not included on the national news or where he wins the
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:27.520]  official scientific poll so they have a little fake internet poll and don't even
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:32.240]  include him and then he loses that shows they're scared that shows they're
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:36.920]  trying to hide things that shows that that they're getting desperate because
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:43.320]  they are engaging in such crazy things let's go ahead and go to David in Ohio
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:48.600]  David you're on the air ditto Alex and Bob can you hear me okay yes sir welcome
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:54.160]  thanks for holding so long yeah max I want to ask max a couple of questions
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:44:00.640]  I'll just reword it but Bob now he knows as much or more go ahead well if you
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:04.680]  tell me if max is still listening I just wanted to say would you please get
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:11.280]  bill still on your show and Alex I had emailed you I had asked the request if
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:16.320]  you get Byron Dale on your show this you know you're talking about things you
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:21.200]  can do now alternative methods and systems Byron is currently in the
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:25.880]  State House in Minnesota trying to get a state bank of Minnesota there and we
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:29.720]  have covered state banks we have interviewed still but state banks are
[02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:34.720]  a very good idea anything any questions or other comments David well the other
[02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:39.840]  question I had was I was just gonna tease max he had made some predictions
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:45.720]  about that volcano last year and all his predictions came right and I just wanted
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:50.840]  to say hi to my brother Jim and Orifino I know he's your biggest fan Alex well
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:56.320]  thank you so much David yeah max said that historically big volcanoes blowing
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:01.760]  up and signify revolution and that did start up in Europe but I think he was
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:07.040]  being more tongue-in-cheek but max is a character a real character you ought to
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:11.120]  know him behind the scenes ladies and gentlemen he's even crazier than I am
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:21.400]  Sean in Australia on the air with Bob Chapman go ahead listen your phone is
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:27.120]  almost unintelligible are you on a speakerphone
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:31.000]  you're okay just just get your mouth whisper into the microphone we'll be
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:35.680]  able to hear you okay well this one's originally for max and what I wanted to
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:41.960]  say was um what I say happening is that besides taking the public infrastructure
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:47.040]  and utilities embrace I suspect that the real deal is that they actually you know
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:51.840]  want to create an ultimatum where they trade debt for some of the great islands
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:58.520]  to possibly create little fantasy pleasure lands for themselves is this
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:02.440]  is this something that people have looked into because of course it would be a
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:07.040]  contemporary example of what you covered back in America destroyed bodies on when
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:12.760]  you were a young handsome go-getter Alex so well I heard about America destroyed
[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:17.640]  by design but Bob did you get that question I did get a part about Greece
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:22.960]  and I think from the very beginning they will they wanted to rape Greece I
[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:28.280]  think they like the territory and the internationalists have always been
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:34.800]  crazy about southern Greece and Crete and so I think that they had that in mind
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:41.880]  if you notice there's Mr. Salaraz said he's the head of the other Democratic
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:48.680]  Party will call it I forget the name of it and he said that why didn't you do
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:54.680]  that with Portugal and Ireland and I think that's a very good question they
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:47:00.040]  weren't asked to collateralize their debt with anything and Greece was yes I
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:04.280]  think the gentleman from Australia is correct I think they had designs they
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:07.200]  they wanted to take everything in the country because they wanted well that's
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:12.160]  what the IMF and World Bank have done in Latin America in Africa and Asia they
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.320]  openly get the national parks and things and then build you know casinos and
[02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:22.840]  luxury parks on them and and you know mining operations but but but yes the
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:27.360]  US land that we cover in America's robot design is pledged not just the
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:31.720]  national parks but quote buffer zones around them to the UN I mean that's on
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:36.360]  record even National Geographic you know covered that a decade ago but but put
[02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:40.280]  it in a good light saying how wonderful all of this is and I remember
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:45.320]  articles in mainstream news in the last six months where it admitted that in one
[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:50.960]  case that had a multi-billionaire hedge fund guy who who Greece owed a couple
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:55.280]  billion to but but through fraud he'd sold them fraudulent stuff and he was
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:59.840]  saying give me this island and I'll forgive you the two billion so and so in
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:04.760]  some cases the banksters are physically individually this is over 600 islands
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:08.080]  around Greece very beautiful I've never been there my parents love to go there
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:11.400]  they said it's a beautiful place in the world and they're actually that's what
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:16.360]  the Roman emperors like to vacation they're openly giving individuals the
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:21.400]  infrastructure and that reminds me of what Max talked about he went the wrong
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:24.880]  hotel when he first got to Greece last week and walked into this big
[02:48:24.880 --> 02:48:29.040]  international you know business association meeting and there was Steve
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:33.400]  Forbes and who knew Max from years ago on Wall Street said Max this is great
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:37.040]  we're taking everything over pennies on the dollar it's ours thinking he was
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:42.160]  part of the and so like like vultures the banksters are all there perching and
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:46.960]  they're even using American bailout money to then go in and and buy off the
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:51.040]  government and then they get the private islands I mean these guys are a bunch of
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:56.640]  whitey bulgers well that was the international chamber of commerce and
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:01.040]  if you look back in the history of the Forbes family you'll find out that they
[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:05.920]  made their money running drugs for the British from India over to China in the
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:10.200]  early 1800s that's right the Forbes are the one of the big opium families on
[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:14.960]  record that's not even a hidden thing well the public doesn't know what and
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:20.120]  we're telling him but come on shipping heroin in his friendly the Forbes are
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:24.440]  great people especially when the old man Forbes it right around well I'm not
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:29.200]  going to get into it whatever what I'm not either what he does privately it's
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:34.360]  just why why don't we let such scum rule us let's go it incredible it's
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:39.320]  incredible George in Connecticut George you're on the air go ahead I I have one
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:44.280]  statement but I also wanted you to know that we don't have to feel so bad Alex
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:50.520]  because there was a big report on that that the vaccine situation on Gary
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:55.240]  know and he has 10 million listeners so it's getting out there bad the thing I
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:59.600]  wanted to say is we should start a manifesto almost any any big organization
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:03.680]  starts a manifesto against the banksters and ours and our logo should be the
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:08.360]  guillotine and we should sort of get cut out and take and then basically spray
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:12.800]  painted on the sides of their cars when they're not in the car so they get that
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:19.480]  we're after their butts very well said we are after their butts anything else
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:24.360]  sir no that's it but I just want to let you know it's getting out there and it's
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:29.840]  spreading I monitor all types of radio stations from left to right and I'm just
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:34.200]  amazed how the how all different aspects you're talking about are exploding
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:39.640]  across the spectrum so it's it's about over but when everybody's talking about
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:45.040]  it it's about over but also one of the thing I took a survey for stay there
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:50.240]  stay there George and then JB Matt will obviously have to do five minutes of many

[02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:17.080]  from underneath the Americans at home I've turned a tremendous influence on our
[02:52:17.080 --> 02:52:21.320]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:26.560]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:31.160]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:35.560]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:43.200]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:48.760]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:09.400]  political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network we were going to have a
[02:54:09.400 --> 02:54:13.900]  report from Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson down at the Capitol but they were set to
[02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:18.960]  vote and they have neary unanimous in the house and the Senate and the Senate
[02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:22.280]  just didn't show up most of senators aren't there it's the middle of an
[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:26.600]  emergency session they usually go to midnight and so the feds had threatened
[02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:32.080]  a bunch of stuff last night and so the traitorous Texas Senate again doesn't
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:35.680]  want to be politically on record so they're trying to run out the clock on
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:39.560]  the special session but it's not gonna stop the TSA is gonna keep groping
[02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:44.400]  little kids and sticking their hands down miss USA's pants keep saying miss
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:49.000]  America it's miss USA two different things and I think it's good what the
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:52.000]  tyrants are doing because it's gonna wake America up and the rest of the
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:57.800]  world or let's go back now to George in Connecticut George you brought up the
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:04.400]  point and I monitor talk radio I have the unique position to be well known
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:08.840]  for being on a lot of national TV and internet and all that where people know
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:13.200]  me so so they'll actually say hey I know what's going on and it's a lot of
[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:17.600]  people you know respond it's kind of a radar sonar ping but you're saying you
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:21.720]  hear the same thing and I heard on talk radio people are now really starting to
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:25.480]  get that it's mega corporations that aren't free market that control both
[02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:32.120]  parties Bob Chapman that's very exciting it certainly is because this is the
[02:55:32.120 --> 02:55:37.960]  genesis of the whole thing corporates fascism from the very beginning you know
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:43.000]  I think that Europe was a trial run for what we're seeing today and they
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:48.160]  control but as you said both houses Wall Street banking corporate America
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:54.200]  transnational corporations the the law enforcement agencies and it just goes
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:59.520]  on and on and it's gonna be their arrogance will be their undoing I want
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:02.560]  to go to JB and Matt the George you were talking about a survey when we went to
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:08.200]  break yes I got a survey in my my email it was I think was Newsweek and I did
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:13.920]  the survey it turned out Ron Paul turned out to be 61.3% of all
[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:19.920]  questioners who answered the thing picked Ron Paul and I found that amazing
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:24.240]  because on all conservative radio stations I listened to yesterday not one
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:29.240]  of them even mentioned him as a viable there's a talking point monitoring three
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:33.400]  local shows this morning well San Antonio and Austin I heard them all say
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:38.360]  sorry to tell you Ron Paul's not viable he's struggling to even be relevant when
[02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:44.440]  he's winning almost every poll it's a total hoax there's a talking point these
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:51.120]  people are scum well it was also on the on the left wing and PR I was listening
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:54.320]  this morning and actually called them up and brought wanted to bring this point
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:58.760]  up because they didn't they didn't even mention it as a Republican viable
[02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:02.480]  candidate and they said oh we don't want to talk about that yeah Rockefeller
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:07.040]  radio wouldn't let you on God bless you no I know and it doesn't matter though
[02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:11.120]  Ron Paul's hitting the barbed wire don't be mad if he doesn't win he wins in the
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:17.200]  arena of ideas let's jam in let's jam in JB and Tejas JB you're on the air with

[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:39.240]  the vaccines this really scares the system headline new study finds direct

[03:00:42.200 --> 03:00:50.480]  article out to everybody JB and then Matt with Bob Chapman right now JB is
[03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:54.800]  that the only point you had that we're on this digital TV station down in
[03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:58.280]  Houston well I can't say nothing about I'm doing it it's me cause of
[03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:02.960]  broadcasting it's a Spanish station and they only talk English it's a very
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:07.160]  breakthrough station it's out of sight and your your films are very very
[03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:12.960]  illuminating and and extremely scary to my friends watching it they go I can't
[03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:16.160]  believe this is coming true and I said well look at this 9-11 look at this in
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:20.240]  game look at this film they just freak out totally freak out they can't believe
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:26.240]  it yeah it's there's another fellow who owns a business network down there that's
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:29.600]  on cable there but also other parts of the world and I know they air my stuff
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:33.160]  down there and that's how it spreads I don't think that's the same person but
[03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:36.960]  so many great people but I'm telling you I'm getting calls now and emails all of
[03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:42.240]  the country going the nightly news just ended and American Idol didn't come on
[03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:48.560]  it was it was your it was today's TV show off the web cut up commercial free
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:52.480]  for three hours I mean I mean this stuff's pouring in Bob this is how
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:56.520]  revolutions of ideas really happen people have got it they know what's
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:01.920]  happening the establishment's gonna ignore it but just just that this is
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:06.640]  happening with my show imagine what else is going on Bob Chapman it's
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:13.840]  exhilarating and that's why we have to keep on plugging all of us all the
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:19.120]  listeners you got to spread the word let the world know the truth of what's
[03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:25.320]  going on that's all we need that's all we need well I'll tell you what's really
[03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:28.720]  exhilarating is I don't want to die I'm willing to die if they kill me or set me
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:32.840]  up but it's not fun I like living and the fact that there's so many targets and
[03:02:32.840 --> 03:02:36.560]  so many leaders and so many well-spoken people now Bob they're not gonna be able
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:41.560]  to shut us down nothing's gonna stop us if we realize we're gonna win that's
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:47.840]  right and we want thousands more to be leaders retire and play golf every day
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:54.160]  oh I love that man I tell you thank you so much JB I good to hear that report
[03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:58.120]  we'll look into it what's cool is I keep looking at these reports and they're
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:05.920]  true Matt in Ohio you're on the air go ahead hey Alex and Bob thanks for
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:14.720]  taking my call one point and then your comments on that I think that the the
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:21.800]  TSA issue is a ready-made issue to spring someone like Ron Paul into the
[03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:27.960]  presidency I think if you took a strong stance against it my first sort of
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:31.360]  business as president would be to enforce the Fourth Amendment yeah we're
[03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:36.500]  probably talking to Ron Paul tomorrow I mean next week and I and during the
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:39.280]  breaks I could probably get a hold of him privately as well I'm gonna say look
[03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:43.320]  you're great you're awesome but you know he does 10 million interviews but then
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:47.040]  it's very calm in him he needs to get angry people love it when he does it he
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:50.800]  needs to attack attack attack is that what you're saying he needs to call out
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:55.000]  he does call out the tyranny but I mean he needs to get hardcore is that what
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:59.840]  you're saying well basically just to take a stance when he said you know the
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:03.480]  first thing I would do 10 minutes after getting elected and walking to the
[03:04:03.480 --> 03:04:07.200]  Oval Office I'd place a call over to Janet and Paul Tano and I would end
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:12.760]  this tyranny in our airports I think you'd get elected because so many people
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:17.800]  are sick and tired of the TSA and the president has 430 to stop with a single
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:22.400]  phone call absolutely do it absolutely no one else will go on record to do that
[03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:26.560]  if he did that I think he would win that's my thought now you brought up a
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:31.920]  great point you got the last 30 seconds we need to really I mean Ron Paul is
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:34.600]  being hardcore but I think he really he needs to be even more hardcore what do
[03:04:34.600 --> 03:04:42.600]  you think Bob you're right he has to get a little vicious I mean we have the
[03:04:42.600 --> 03:04:48.400]  capability to be vicious verbally for a reason that's right we want to save the
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:52.000]  country and probably save the world in the process yeah they're always telling
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:55.800]  us don't be extreme don't be angry because that's what works folks okay
[03:04:55.800 --> 03:04:59.040]  that's what works Bob on God willing we'll see you next Friday in the third
[03:04:59.040 --> 03:05:26.600]  hour thank you Bob Chapman
