[08:24.000 --> 08:29.040]  and resistance to tyranny i am alexander emrick jones of austin texas
[08:29.040 --> 08:36.640]  this broadcasting worldwide our news websites are info wars dot com prison planet dot com and
[08:36.640 --> 08:44.320]  we're streaming video of the radio show at prison planet dot tv if you're a radio listener
[08:44.320 --> 08:49.440]  and hear me say put this up on screen let's play that clip let's do that it just adds an added
[08:49.440 --> 08:56.160]  level of documentation i started doing this taping the radio show and it was live and then airing it
[08:56.160 --> 09:00.560]  on local cable access because people wouldn't believe me when i would have an associated
[09:00.560 --> 09:05.680]  press article that said the federal reserve had been caught shipping in you know three
[09:05.680 --> 09:11.840]  tons of pure cocaine into san antonio i would read a headline like that and people wouldn't
[09:11.840 --> 09:19.600]  believe it or i'd read an article out of newcastle pa where a man yelled back at a police dog that was
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.200]  in a walmart parking lot that was barking at him so he was arrested for assaulting an officer
[09:25.200 --> 09:33.360]  verbally people didn't believe that when i was on the radio show i started info wars dot com in 1997
[09:33.360 --> 09:40.800]  it's already been on the air a few years because people didn't believe articles i was reading i
[09:40.800 --> 09:47.760]  would go down to the local periodical news shop it's called news one half of the store was periodicals
[09:47.760 --> 09:54.560]  from all over the country the other half was porn but just in 1995 96 most the internet didn't have
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.600]  a lot of news on it they had like the drudge report and stuff that would link to reports or he'd
[09:59.600 --> 10:03.440]  write about reports but you know mainstream news didn't even really have websites then
[10:03.440 --> 10:08.720]  that had much news so you'd have to you know i'd go to barns and nobles sometimes they had a small
[10:08.720 --> 10:14.480]  periodical area but it wasn't updated like news uh local place in austin i would go in there every
[10:14.480 --> 10:22.640]  day because i had a six day a week radio show by by 1997 and the point is i would go and clip out
[10:22.640 --> 10:26.880]  all these articles and come on air and cover it and people would just say oh that's not true
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.600]  so i started scanning them in and started doing things like that at info wars dot com and that's
[10:31.600 --> 10:38.000]  how it was born and so that's why we stream video and now of course most talk shows you know they
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.960]  started 10 years ago having a webcam or something but we have a five camera shoot in here and so
[10:42.960 --> 10:47.600]  much more so that's why it's important to become members of prison planet dot tv because then you
[10:47.600 --> 10:52.240]  could see the daily radio show and the nightly news show and all the films and 17 years of material
[10:52.240 --> 10:56.160]  that we've uploaded up on the site we've had prison planet dot tv for nine and a half years now
[10:56.720 --> 11:01.120]  i digress though that is not what i meant to get into here at the start of the broadcast
[11:01.120 --> 11:05.920]  incredible news that we're going to be breaking down on so many fronts just when you thought you'd
[11:05.920 --> 11:13.360]  heard it all of the tsa the tsa is now at campaign events tsa rifles through bags conducts patdowns
[11:13.360 --> 11:21.600]  at paul ryan event so they're now at uh santa fe proms by the way people won't believe that type
[11:21.600 --> 11:30.080]  and tsa at judge rules tsa must be at santa fe prom uh they're now popping up in dallas san antonio
[11:30.080 --> 11:36.000]  and houston i'm told by my police sources that the next few months they'll be here in austin uh the
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.600]  army uh i didn't get it on tape but i talked to police officer friend of mine up in temple last
[11:41.600 --> 11:46.400]  week ran another checkpoint on the highway we've gotten it on tape twice but this time we didn't
[11:46.400 --> 11:53.680]  get it on tape um so that's all going on it's nice to have army checkpoints 200 miles from the border
[11:53.680 --> 11:59.120]  uh it's just they're really ratcheting things up uh we've got robot cars to take over you won't be
[11:59.120 --> 12:06.160]  allowed to drive your own cars soon uh we've got uh just just an absolute blitz of information
[12:06.160 --> 12:12.000]  and no guest today until the last 30 minutes it's funny i'm mentioning access tv uh linda
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.640]  latowski who's a nice lady who worked at access i don't know 30 something years ago the 40th anniversary
[12:18.640 --> 12:23.760]  of austin access television you're like why do i care this is a national show i'm saying why
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.720]  i'm some of you are like why am i covering this access television was born in austin texas and
[12:28.720 --> 12:33.120]  they're trying to get rid of it but the real reason we're having her on is just to talk about
[12:34.320 --> 12:39.600]  the fact that they tried to shut it down a few years ago until i discovered the fraud going on
[12:39.600 --> 12:44.160]  and we got some of the folks to be sent to prison and then linda and others who've been there decades
[12:44.160 --> 12:49.600]  ago were able to come back in and keep it afloat so we'll talk about access tv itself nationwide
[12:49.600 --> 12:55.200]  still there still a really good avenue for people to break into media to get information out to air
[12:55.200 --> 12:59.760]  films to air material where you're going to get an audience that it really isn't getting their news
[12:59.760 --> 13:05.040]  from the web i mean a big city like austin hundreds of thousands can see your show
[13:05.040 --> 13:11.440]  as they're surfing through basic cable but in mega cities like new york i mean so many careers
[13:11.440 --> 13:15.520]  have been launched in comedy news you name it with access so many people want to break into
[13:15.520 --> 13:20.880]  media they go get a degree they go labor for a decade at a radio station and get laid off
[13:20.880 --> 13:25.920]  when instead you should start your own youtube show you should start your own blog radio show
[13:25.920 --> 13:31.840]  you should start your just just do it do it for the passion and you'll have success all these other
[13:31.840 --> 13:37.600]  people get into patriot media trying to be big stars and they're not successful because they
[13:37.600 --> 13:43.280]  want immediate success you have to want to defeat the new world order and i know a lot of you do
[13:43.280 --> 13:48.320]  so you're always asking me to do this or do that or hire you i don't have the money but i'm here
[13:48.320 --> 13:53.120]  telling you ways to get involved so that's the last 30 minutes of the show now before i launch
[13:53.120 --> 13:59.840]  into news and believe me it is a lot here and i want to talk about military suicides we've talked
[13:59.840 --> 14:03.280]  about this quite a bit but i want to really delve into it today so i'm going to do that the star of
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.000]  the next hour i'm going to give the number out in a few minutes and really try to go to your calls
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.640]  early in the shower after i hit a smattering of some of the headlines that we have here they're
[14:12.640 --> 14:17.440]  bringing in news so fast making my head spin right now this is a big issue though if you're
[14:17.440 --> 14:24.640]  watching at prisonplanet.tv i have in my little hands uh the economic collapse and today at the
[14:24.640 --> 14:32.320]  end of the show we will send out a e copy um that you can flip just like a regular magazine

[14:56.880 --> 15:03.120]  now here is the issue ladies and gentlemen we printed 50 000 copies at one printer that
[15:03.120 --> 15:07.440]  were put on the streets of austin it'll be the collector's edition with the typo on the cover
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.840]  i love it you gotta love it but it's an incredible magazine uh so much key information
[15:11.840 --> 15:21.520]  we were going to print 20 000 copies to put one free in every order for books videos t-shirts
[15:21.520 --> 15:28.000]  stuff at info warshop.com and we figured that would be enough for people that wanted to buy them at
[15:28.000 --> 15:36.720]  cost uh in bulk people who you know wanted them in their orders didn't happen they all sold out
[15:36.720 --> 15:45.440]  last night they all sold out 20 000 copies gone boom 20 000 bam so i mean i knew there was a hunger
[15:45.440 --> 15:48.800]  for this because i had a hunger for it i have a hunger for it you have a hunger for it because
[15:48.800 --> 15:54.160]  we're all the same i mean we're just humans that love freedom i got your number you got my number
[15:54.160 --> 16:01.920]  we're on the same page doesn't feel good 20 000 bam sold so i don't know what to print do i print
[16:01.920 --> 16:09.200]  20 000 more 50 000 more they're gonna print them today they're gonna print them today so we'll have
[16:09.200 --> 16:14.800]  them so we're keeping the order stuff up there if you want to order the new magazine i'm making the
[16:14.800 --> 16:20.880]  executive decision we're gonna print 20 000 copies more and that's it okay 20 000 copies more and
[16:20.880 --> 16:24.800]  that's it and i did just raise the price a couple dollars on each bulk order because they did the
[16:24.800 --> 16:29.520]  math today the computers can do it we lost money because i just kind of you know they said yesterday
[16:29.520 --> 16:33.120]  what do we put in the cart we've been asking for a week and i said this number sounds good that
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.800]  number sounds good but after i mean when but but but we factor in you know in 100 order or a 50 order
[16:38.800 --> 16:45.040]  or whatever we factor in you know what the shipping is 100 of them is like 15 pounds and i guess i
[16:45.040 --> 16:49.600]  miscalculated a bit because we're actually losing money on some of them so i've i've upped them all
[16:49.600 --> 16:57.520]  you know a 10 packs not 9.95 it's 14.95 uh and then me you know a uh we've upped them all a little
[16:57.520 --> 17:02.000]  bit just because we cannot even deal with it we're gonna have to probably hire three four more
[17:02.000 --> 17:07.440]  shipping people part time or or well not part time full time but but just as temporary to be
[17:07.440 --> 17:14.320]  technical just to get all these out we've kind of kind of created a crisis here uh but so that's
[17:14.320 --> 17:19.200]  why i'm saying i'm printing 20 000 more and that's it when it sells out and undoubtedly it will
[17:19.200 --> 17:24.320]  that's it because i've got to make major changes break down the numbers look at it to be able to
[17:24.320 --> 17:32.800]  even handle this i mean this is going big right now 20 000 bam in less than 12 hours bam gone
[17:33.360 --> 17:40.880]  gone 20 000 gone so uh we're going to print 20 000 more they were in there asking me seconds
[17:40.880 --> 17:45.760]  before i went live 20 000 more and that's it because that's all we can handle that's all we
[17:45.760 --> 17:52.320]  can handle shipping out to people uh it's caused quite frankly a disaster um but they're going to
[17:52.320 --> 17:57.760]  stay as late as it takes to get them all out to you so again get your orders in now for the
[17:57.760 --> 18:03.440]  info wars magazine i'm going to go to break and come back with all the news but here's what it covers
[18:03.440 --> 18:08.480]  the economic collapse where does money come from rome burned will we a brief history of false
[18:08.480 --> 18:13.280]  flag attacks it's designed for the mainstream public who is unaware this is a weapon to wake

[25:01.760 --> 25:08.960]  three million for anti-suicide nasal spray research because the suicides are at all time mega records

[25:21.600 --> 25:24.000]  all of that and i'm going to explain to you why this is happening
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.520]  in fact i'll go ahead and tell you the main reason they're putting them on serotonin reuptake
[25:31.520 --> 25:42.960]  inhibitors that on the insert says destroys your your lack of restraint to where if you feel like
[25:42.960 --> 25:48.000]  killing yourself you just do it you feel like killing others you just do it it is in the hallucinogen
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  class that's that's the biggest issue because big pharma runs things and runs the kook cult of
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.120]  psychiatrists and psychologists they're going to keep doing this and it's a cocktail of other reasons
[25:59.120 --> 26:03.440]  but i always say something's coming up and just get to it i'm going to talk about all that in
[26:03.440 --> 26:11.920]  the next hour okay let's just do this i get so wound up with all this news and then i never even
[26:11.920 --> 26:16.400]  cover it because i get so upset let's just give the number out and take calls and whatever you
[26:16.400 --> 26:21.200]  want to discuss yesterday i said i wanted to talk about the melting down economy the preparations
[26:21.200 --> 26:24.800]  for collapse do you think they'll be a collapse and almost none of the callers called out about
[26:24.800 --> 26:29.600]  that they call them other personal stories or whatever whatever i want to talk to the callers
[26:29.600 --> 26:37.200]  but i want to hear your take on that your take is on the general craziness of the world 800-2599231
[26:37.200 --> 26:49.280]  800-2599231 i do have an angle on prince harry naked pictures at los vegas party with his friends
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.240]  yeah those are real good friends that are taking pictures of you running around having an orgy
[26:54.880 --> 27:04.720]  they're spinning it as a playing a naked game of pool of billiards in fact don't even show the
[27:04.720 --> 27:14.800]  photos guys i don't want to show them on tv and it just shows media control if somebody the globalist
[27:14.800 --> 27:18.720]  didn't like was doing that it'd be over for him but the media is like oh what's the big deal he's
[27:18.720 --> 27:26.080]  in vegas they're just playing a naked game of billiards like strip poker yeah that's why there's
[27:26.080 --> 27:31.040]  shots of him bending women over and having sex with him i mean that's what that is he's got a
[27:31.040 --> 27:40.720]  woman bent over he's obviously having sex with her she's penetrated and and normally i wouldn't
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.960]  cover a piece of tabloid news like this unless there's a teaching point in it a teaching moment
[27:44.960 --> 27:51.680]  and you notice here he's got a blonde bent over the table having sex with her that's what this is
[27:51.680 --> 27:58.080]  the prince having sex with a woman and they spin it that's what spin is oh it was just a fun naked
[27:58.080 --> 28:03.760]  game of pool and a private party called an orgy the headline should be prince caught in orgy
[28:03.760 --> 28:15.360]  remember a bunch of republicans were out on a boat in israel in the uh mediterranean and some of
[28:15.360 --> 28:20.720]  them didn't have swim shorts so they discreetfully with towels at night took the towels off and jumped
[28:20.720 --> 28:27.520]  in naked others were wearing their underwear and the and the fbi investigated oh my gosh what's going
[28:27.520 --> 28:34.000]  on here and again i'm even defending the republicans it just shows because the white house and justice
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.240]  department are a bunch of criminals who are political they went after the republicans
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.760]  for reportedly out of about 20 people maybe one or two stripped off naked well yeah when you're
[28:43.760 --> 28:48.160]  wearing a suit you don't get in your underwear because then you're going to be wet when you get
[28:48.160 --> 28:57.920]  out at night i've swam naked in the ocean many times i guess i'm evil but the point is i'm not
[28:57.920 --> 29:03.520]  even judging the prince he's not even the prince his mother was well known when i was an army officer
[29:03.520 --> 29:10.000]  the spinning image of prince harry prince charles has even been caught shooting his mouth off about it
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  it's just it's just an example of media spin and that's not our top story but that's the first
[29:16.000 --> 29:19.600]  thing over here on my right hand side in the stack so i'm going to come back run through some more of
[29:19.600 --> 29:27.680]  these it's just an example of how they spend things 800 25 at 99231 americans toss out as much as 40

[32:55.600 --> 33:14.880]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:25.840 --> 33:33.120]  you know i heard local talk radio reading out of the houston chronicle this morning
[33:34.160 --> 33:39.680]  and uh it was the former i guess she's current state reps is anaheim doing the show along with
[33:39.680 --> 33:47.600]  the other uh host and they were marveling and wondering allowed why 500 million dollars a
[33:47.600 --> 33:54.400]  month in the state of texas is given to people on lone star food stamp cards and why they can get
[33:54.400 --> 34:01.040]  $50 cash back each time they go and buy cigarettes and liquor with it and how a state study showed
[34:01.040 --> 34:05.920]  the majority of it was going to illegal aliens where the state is told to accept the fake tax
[34:05.920 --> 34:11.680]  ID numbers and so the illegal can walk in with five fake numbers and get five cards right there
[34:12.880 --> 34:17.280]  illegals can drink and drive and they're left alone the list goes on and on because they're god
[34:17.280 --> 34:21.760]  the government wants them here to drive down wages and vote for gun control and the destruction
[34:21.760 --> 34:27.440]  of this country they work for the collaborator globalist and have taken over the nation but
[34:27.440 --> 34:34.160]  i sat there for 30 minutes driving to work and they just couldn't figure out why this was happening
[34:34.160 --> 34:40.160]  why they're getting rid of our social security we're going bankrupt but but but tens of billions
[34:40.160 --> 34:48.160]  of dollars a month is in food stamps and they're running ads saying come get your food stamps even
[34:48.160 --> 34:54.480]  if you have a job you probably qualify because they want people dependent and they want political
[34:54.480 --> 35:03.760]  armies that are dependent let me explain what this is 5 000 years ago let's pick a archaeological
[35:03.760 --> 35:12.640]  area in the tigress refates sector they have found primitive pens and areas where humans began
[35:12.640 --> 35:22.400]  to domesticate even before that pigs and goats and sheep and horses and dogs and cats and you
[35:22.400 --> 35:27.520]  know how cultures domesticate animals well one way to do it is to kill the parents and then
[35:27.520 --> 35:34.400]  hand raise the young bottle raise the young or you can simply start bringing in animals and
[35:34.400 --> 35:39.120]  leaving food out for them and then build a pin that they come into and eat out of and then next
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.000]  time they come and eat you close the pin then you start hand feeding them once they're starving
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.960]  that's how you domesticate animals and see that's what this is is domestication
[35:50.400 --> 35:54.240]  at homeland security the last two years is announced they just legalized all the illegal
[35:54.240 --> 35:59.360]  aliens by fiat congress is doing nothing just like they're shutting down our power plants
[35:59.360 --> 36:04.320]  congress wouldn't pass the law to do it so obama just did it and there's the use of
[36:04.320 --> 36:10.880]  chronicle food stamps hit record level in texas
[36:12.800 --> 36:20.640]  it's all over the country and they will take your house if you haven't paid the property
[36:20.640 --> 36:25.600]  taxes well most people paid for their houses but they can't pay the property taxes because
[36:25.600 --> 36:29.920]  they're retired or whatever the property taxes on a small house are like five six thousand dollars
[36:29.920 --> 36:33.920]  in austin where i live much higher in other areas of the country and then when they just come and
[36:33.920 --> 36:38.960]  they auction off your house and then they come with police who kill you if you try to resist
[36:39.600 --> 36:45.440]  so they're killing people killing them if they don't pay their income tax the private
[36:45.440 --> 36:50.560]  fellow reserve killing people if they don't pay the property tax that didn't exist until 60 years
[36:50.560 --> 36:56.880]  ago killing people if they you know drive through a toll road without paying the cops chase you down
[36:56.880 --> 36:59.920]  you're lucky if they don't beat you have to death for it because you're a piece of trash
[36:59.920 --> 37:04.560]  who's got to be kept in line you're an american scum you're a milk cow slave and you better learn
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.920]  it and get it through your head but hey boss why do we care we got plenty of food why we want to
[37:09.920 --> 37:14.720]  gang up on all these ants because those ants outnumber us a hundred to one and if they ever
[37:14.720 --> 37:22.400]  figure that out that will end our way of life that is how this works you know the movie ants
[37:23.520 --> 37:29.040]  is it bugs life i forget the point is try to find that clip i want to play that going out to
[37:29.040 --> 37:35.840]  break if we can that's what we're dealing with here and i see the cops all all amped up driving
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.080]  around their motorcycles looking back and forth and the cops all looking crazed and it's like
[37:40.640 --> 37:45.040]  man you really think you're in fallujah because they've been taught we're the enemy but illegal
[37:45.040 --> 37:51.760]  alien is the god and i and i quite frankly am tired of it and people say oh well you just don't
[37:51.760 --> 37:56.080]  like the illegal aliens uh well bingo yeah i don't like the fact that they're teamed up with the
[37:56.080 --> 38:02.480]  globalist and above the law and that they could start businesses and not pay taxes and get five
[38:02.480 --> 38:07.600]  or six or seven or eight welfare checks because the system only lets them engage in the open fraud
[38:07.600 --> 38:13.200]  and then drive around in giant brand new cars and have more than citizens do only because they're
[38:13.200 --> 38:19.440]  there in that niche as a weapon to drive down wages because again the system doesn't let citizens
[38:19.440 --> 38:26.560]  engage in that type of fraud they throw the book at you i mean i saw that report that we could have
[38:26.560 --> 38:30.960]  broken i'm just pointing out that we were here in austin that national story a few weeks ago
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.880]  where the illegals the irs just gives them tax ID numbers knowing as many as they want hey you want
[38:36.880 --> 38:44.960]  20 of those and with each one they get tax rebates they get tax refunds they get uh to to sign up
[38:44.960 --> 38:49.840]  credit lines and then they attach it to other people social security numbers and the banks accept
[38:49.840 --> 38:58.720]  that they accept the fraud of the illegals and now california and a bunch of other states that
[38:58.720 --> 39:04.080]  already give more in-state tuition to illegals than the new people who are from the state california
[39:04.080 --> 39:08.320]  is set to issue driver's licenses to young illegal immigrants californians on the verge of allowing
[39:08.320 --> 39:13.600]  hot well texas does that i mean they just give them to illegals period you can go in and get one
[39:13.600 --> 39:18.160]  but if you're a citizen you're treated like trash you say hey why do i have to show five
[39:18.160 --> 39:22.560]  forms and thumb scan and all this and she'll be like trooper i've been arrested going in there
[39:22.560 --> 39:28.160]  doing this they'll come over mow up you've got a problem this country's ours now boy it's ours now
[39:29.520 --> 39:35.120]  we work for goldman sacks of course they don't even know that but that's the spirit of it
[39:37.280 --> 39:41.040]  and california is on the verge of allowing hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.720]  they always start with one group to receive driver's license for the first time in nearly two decades
[39:46.720 --> 39:50.160]  the key question is how to do it they'll just do it like texas and other states
[39:54.240 --> 39:59.280]  i mean hell the police all over the country and 800 plus sanctuary cities already accept consulate
[39:59.280 --> 40:03.280]  matriculous and they've got consulates in austin in houston right here where i live
[40:04.240 --> 40:09.200]  and and and i mean if you go in there it's pure nationalism they teach in comic books
[40:09.200 --> 40:13.520]  that are handed out in mexico that the south west belongs to mexico
[40:13.520 --> 40:17.200]  that white people are evil and that the united states is going to be taken over
[40:17.200 --> 40:24.480]  and again this isn't even about hispanic whites this is about a nationalism and a government
[40:24.480 --> 40:29.840]  that is being used by the globalists to help bring down the united states help break down
[40:29.840 --> 40:35.520]  our culture and what we are our diverse culture with a bunch of nationalism
[40:35.520 --> 40:40.960]  while the globalists are busy destroying mexico as well shipping the drugs into the country
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.680]  and we shouldn't sit here and lie to ourselves about all this going on but this is another example
[40:48.480 --> 40:53.360]  just like they said we're going to stop deporting illegals and now they just let them go they let
[40:53.360 --> 41:00.480]  aggravated felons go the government decides that is the bureaucracy not the congress
[41:00.480 --> 41:05.520]  they even use remember that article of fox news ap a few years ago illegals were hired to build the
[41:05.520 --> 41:12.400]  border fence that's just for show it's a total for show build a few miles here a few miles there
[41:14.080 --> 41:20.720]  they put giant open gates on it for the wildlife to go through i mean it's a joke it's a total
[41:20.720 --> 41:27.360]  sickening joke and i just bring this up to illustrate what an out of control lawless criminal
[41:27.360 --> 41:32.080]  system we have that ships drugs into the country guns out of the country and guns to drug gangs
[41:32.080 --> 41:36.640]  around the u.s. and it comes out in federal court and nobody gets in trouble
[41:40.960 --> 41:46.720]  because the public is in a zombie trance state medically the average person medically
[41:46.720 --> 41:52.160]  has a lower brainwave operating system you can pull up the articles on this than they had 20 years ago
[41:52.160 --> 41:59.120]  then they had 20 years ago they're at a near sleep state a daydreaming state you see you say people
[41:59.120 --> 42:02.720]  don't talk to each other anymore people look like they're in the days they don't look like they're
[42:02.720 --> 42:10.560]  in the days they're in one and that's why you've basically got these sharks these piranhas swimming
[42:10.560 --> 42:18.000]  around in our society dealing with victims who don't even know who they are and then you put combat
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.880]  veterans on a bunch of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and they start killing themselves and their
[42:22.880 --> 42:28.800]  families because that's what the drugs are designed to do i'm telling you there's no limit to evil
[42:28.800 --> 42:35.280]  when you give in to evil like our culture has the worst of the evil goes to the top immediately
[42:35.280 --> 42:40.240]  and that's why suddenly it's black uniforms burning cities mass death slave work brigades
[42:40.240 --> 42:46.080]  because to the psychopaths that's beautiful little kids starving to death crying in a cage
[42:46.080 --> 42:53.200]  with pus coming out of their eyes is so beautiful to the new world order it you can go look up articles
[42:53.200 --> 42:58.800]  about decadent art the elite by it's all dead children maggots dead bodies hanging in their
[42:58.800 --> 43:05.200]  private areas of their homes because this is who they are they've come to kill and they're
[43:05.200 --> 43:08.640]  killing everybody you know i was thinking about this yesterday before i go to your calls and the
[43:08.640 --> 43:14.800]  rest of the news i'm gonna cover this later in the second hour about the quote stress vaccines
[43:14.800 --> 43:19.200]  that actually attack your brain so you can't feel emotion anymore they're already testing
[43:19.200 --> 43:23.760]  these on the trips they're testing all sorts of other drugs and what's crazy is i went and saw a
[43:23.760 --> 43:33.680]  movie like the new born film the born legacy and the whole thing beginning to end is totally
[43:33.680 --> 43:44.240]  accurate exactly how things work never seen a movie like it and what's crazy is everything
[43:44.240 --> 43:50.720]  in it is actually hidden in plain view just compartmentalized and we're in a softer stage
[43:50.720 --> 43:55.440]  of the brainwashing and chemical manipulation ourselves but super soldiers they train to be
[43:55.440 --> 44:01.920]  robotic and have super stamina and be able to operate two or three times longer with us we
[44:01.920 --> 44:06.800]  don't get the super soldier treatment we get the estrogen mimicers the toxins the cancer viruses
[44:06.800 --> 44:12.640]  so we're just addled and poisoned so the globalist can operate with with with different treatments
[44:12.640 --> 44:17.520]  and and avoidance schemes they have to be healthy while they sit there killing us and even their
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.080]  minions aren't even part of this they're compartmentalized i'll tell you right now somebody like janet
[44:22.080 --> 44:27.760]  depolitano who's just busy all day running around engaged in degeneracy you know with all her friends
[44:28.880 --> 44:34.880]  she doesn't have even one half the image i've run into top globalist before and they and they know
[44:34.880 --> 44:40.240]  old some of it but they don't even know all of it because they're lazy they've been put in positions
[44:40.240 --> 44:45.040]  because they follow orders and don't think we have reverse engineered the whole deal
[44:46.800 --> 44:51.280]  and we are now in the position the globalist are in but we don't want to carry out the evil
[44:51.280 --> 44:56.800]  we now sit in a vantage point they sit in the info war does and i don't think i'm even worthy to be
[44:56.800 --> 45:01.360]  able to bring in this info but no one else was able to reverse engineer it and create a platform
[45:01.360 --> 45:07.600]  to reach people by the grace of god we're here poised able to do that and be able to communicate
[45:07.600 --> 45:17.840]  with you right now but your food and your water that your children are eating has been weaponized
[45:18.800 --> 45:24.400]  you are being killed look at the statistics look at the numbers the troops are being decommissioned
[45:24.400 --> 45:29.280]  with the suicides that's it's designed that way they know the drugs kill them they're being
[45:29.280 --> 45:38.160]  decommissioned with the du just like you decommission a cannon by spiking it letting the barrel we
[45:38.160 --> 45:43.440]  are nothing but animals to the globalist we are nothing but pure trash filth chattel
[45:49.840 --> 45:51.200]  we are absolute garbage
[45:51.200 --> 46:01.120]  and it's a real shame that the worst of our society has gotten in control who don't just
[46:01.120 --> 46:10.000]  not mind killing us they enjoy it with relish they love burning cities and and and children
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.280]  dying of deformities from du they loved 14 fold increases in deformities in the trips children
[46:15.280 --> 46:20.560]  this is well this is their art this is their this is their literature this is their this is
[46:20.560 --> 46:29.280]  their love letter to the devil you got to work on the dark side like dick cheney said well i've
[46:29.280 --> 46:36.880]  seen the dark side in it in a cheerleader dressed up in a in a devil outfit like you see on the
[46:36.880 --> 46:44.000]  back of people's cars the devil's good looking woman voluptuous woman wild eyes left you know
[46:44.000 --> 46:53.280]  god gave us life and gave us sex and gave us all the pleasures the devil the devil delivers destruction
[46:57.200 --> 47:03.360]  the parable of the genie you asked for the ton of gold you better say i want a ton of gold placed
[47:03.360 --> 47:13.520]  in front of me 10 feet your first wish is that you can do no harm to me
[47:16.000 --> 47:21.120]  or not have someone else do harm to me when you're doing a contract with evil ladies and gentlemen
[47:21.120 --> 47:26.640]  you never get out of it except through christ there's no winning there's no outracing the devil
[47:27.840 --> 47:32.720]  all of you that are going to serve this system will be destroyed and all that you've done to the
[47:32.720 --> 47:38.400]  little children will come back on you many times fold and i'm here to tell you there is a heaven and
[47:38.400 --> 47:46.960]  there is a hell and you will pay you know what hell is it's spiritually being cast into a dimension
[47:48.240 --> 47:55.520]  with people like you i use the analogy of superman too where they put them into that
[47:55.520 --> 48:04.160]  plate of glass that dimension fire them off into space together that's what hell is hell is real
[48:04.160 --> 48:07.520]  let me tell you a law of the universe even if you don't believe in heaven and hell
[48:08.560 --> 48:13.600]  and all you believe in is the pain and the screams of the innocence that's music to your filthy ears
[48:14.240 --> 48:22.480]  need to understand something right now you will be destroyed in this life all the pain you bring
[48:22.480 --> 48:34.240]  to the innocence will be delivered to you many times over remember that and know it well let's go
[48:34.240 --> 48:42.480]  ahead and take a call let's talk to frank in north carolina you're on the air frank yeah thanks alex
[48:43.040 --> 48:48.000]  called in several weeks ago and uh i apologize i was a little uh little out of it when i called
[48:48.000 --> 48:55.520]  uh that uh carnal six uh about carnal six's death i had picked that up on kind of a garbled
[48:55.520 --> 49:01.120]  transmission off a shortwave one night yeah we talked about it and i don't even really know the full
[49:01.120 --> 49:08.320]  story uh but what's on your mind today sir well uh the details were didn't really quite make sense
[49:08.320 --> 49:12.720]  to me but apparently it was confirmed that he had died but i wanted to make another suggestion i had
[49:12.720 --> 49:19.280]  told you some years back and uh i'd asked you about it recently about the movie shooter and you said
[49:19.280 --> 49:23.200]  that you stated that you had really appreciated that movie and you thought it was the best movie
[49:23.200 --> 49:32.240]  of its kind and i totally agree with that yeah but now it isn't uh now uh this uh born film is is
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.160]  incredible because you know what it's not just an element of the government that's doing this evil
[49:36.160 --> 49:41.120]  it's the government in all these movies oh it's a small group doing the evil no it's the whole
[49:41.120 --> 49:47.040]  governments involved they're criminals at the top they're using the soldiers like like like machines
[49:47.680 --> 49:52.560]  and they're killing people and they're injecting viruses into them that reprogram their brain
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.800]  which is what they really do i mean this film is highly classified i took me a decade to reverse
[49:58.800 --> 50:04.640]  engineer what they're doing and this film is real that film is a fictional account of real
[50:04.640 --> 50:10.240]  stuff they're doing i was blown away go ahead okay well blast from the past if you liked the
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.360]  shooter and i wasn't going to go and see the new born movie but i probably will now based on your
[50:15.360 --> 50:22.000]  recommendation but uh there there's a cold war uh version of the shooter uh very similar type
[50:22.000 --> 50:29.360]  movie as with gene hackman and tommy lee jones from 1989 it's called the package and it also goes
[50:29.360 --> 50:36.400]  into meticulous detail about how they set this uh army sergeant up they take him out of his regular
[50:36.400 --> 50:40.720]  unit reassign him you know pump him up telling him he's special he's going to be part of you know
[50:40.720 --> 50:46.480]  this big training drill and whatnot he's going to go undercover and uh tommy lee jones plays the part
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.600]  of the real assassin who takes over his identity and they leave his body you know they're going to
[50:51.600 --> 50:58.000]  leave his body at the scene of the crime i gotta see it absolutely again and these films are exactly
[50:58.000 --> 51:04.320]  how they do it the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012
[51:04.320 --> 51:09.600]  marks the hottest half year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions
[51:09.600 --> 51:15.360]  not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost
[51:15.360 --> 51:20.080]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the

[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:15.760]  unfortunately what i'm seeing around now everywhere is just sheeple i i try to talk to people every
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.840]  day i've called in a bunch and i just have a little suggestion for you since you got this
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.600]  magazine going out now and the nightly news maybe y'all should have a kind of like a how to talk to
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:30.640]  the sheeple section you know telling people you know you're the best at waking up people in the
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.200]  world alex you you do it every day so you probably don't think about well i think i think the key is
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:41.120]  getting real uh you know we had that top lawyer in here wasley swipes lawyer uh and um he's got a
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:46.800]  lot of other people off i mean snipes went to jail for the silly angle of uh misdemeanors but the
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:51.040]  big felonies were defeated very rare to be able to win something like that with the case they had
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.560]  uh and he said no the key is attacking and being in the face and shaking people out of their
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:04.400]  complacency people are in a medical trance sir so if you come up and try to go oh hi oh you know
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.000]  i know this sounds kooky but as you know there's a you're like hey things are getting ready to
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.040]  collapse it's engineered we've been taken over by foreign banks read this article in info wars
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:18.480]  magazine here have a copy where it's got links to the bankers bragging that they've captured america
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.000]  did you know foreign banks said they've captured america and then if they say okay what are you
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.320]  gonna do about it we'll say well hey we better do something about it and then realize go listen i
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.440]  know you're not going to listen now because you don't feel good about yourself you think you're
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.880]  powerless but down the road when stuff really gets bad kind of grab them like with a vulcan deal
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.160]  and say on the shoulder i mean i'm saying figuratively but get them and say listen brother or sister
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:48.880]  if things get a lot worse remember what i said to you remember and so many times a year or two
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.200]  down the road they're going to activate but look the world's always been had a lot of sheeple
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.400]  they are always going to sit there and suck their thumb we're dealing with a very small
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.480]  cadre of global criminals that manipulate their minions through compartmentalization
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:08.880]  and need to know we have the data dump from the top so the best people to target is people in the
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.400]  system because they'll actually found they're the easiest to wake up because when you give them
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.600]  this stuff they go that makes perfect sense it ever made sense how do you know all this well
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.080]  that's true what you're saying there it's like yeah because you know i'm here from the rebellion
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:26.160]  i'm here to help you know come on join us it's we need to get past this fighting with people
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.760]  and say do you know you work for a bunch of pedophile scum here's some proof okay well you
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.680]  don't like doing that do you well wake up and at least know they're the enemy you see you've
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.760]  just got to just over the top because reality is over the top reality is over the top what's
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.480]  sir i go back to this i only say this a lot because people pay attention to harvard there's
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.360]  thousands of studies thousands harvard came out and said in a big study we've reviewed dozens of
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:56.400]  studies from 1976 to 2011 and it's conclusive massive cancer increases in iq reduction in every
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:02.880]  city fluoridating it's deadly poison we recommend it be taken out why would even harvard do that
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:10.320]  because it they got brain damage kids now they got family dying the average idiot working for the
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.920]  system even at the dean level is not a globalist operative oh they've been told there's global
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.800]  governance to help the poor and yeah we are going to reduce population because it's for the earth
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.720]  but we're kind of sweetie and you're going to be part of the winning team and then their 12-year-old
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.440]  gets diagnosed with bone cancer and then they find out that bone cancer is off the chart and then
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:34.000]  they find out and then they bury their kid or they cremate them and then that gets them to get into
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.120]  religion real quick and find out why i'm so angry because i don't like watching a bunch of scumbag
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:45.600]  foreign crazy bankers full of a bunch of bravada and hubris poisoning us i'm here to wake people up
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:51.200]  i'm here to break the conditioning i'm here for the wake-up call it's time to come alive

[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:26.320]  going to be a revolution against these criminals everything i say i bet money he's a listener
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.920]  and they went and psychiatric group grabbed him and his family videotaped him being drug off but
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:37.360]  by the way they didn't call on him so it's not like the family says he's going crazy and so that's
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:43.920]  the new thing is that and now they've moved him and and three hours away uh and and so this is the
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.960]  new people are going to the famicamps i mean they're you know they they went and grabbed this
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.360]  pretty popular talk show host that we've had an article about yesterday uh that um
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:59.040]  um that the northeast intelligence group wrote a story about where they came out to his house
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.720]  with no warrant no nothing tricked him into coming outside grabbed him and said you're

[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:13.440]  to give his guns up so that's the that's the new thing and if they come and grab you the problem
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:21.280]  is now they did this to um a lot of famous writers and people uh like himingway that he said the fbi
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.040]  was spying on him harassing him of course it was later declassified they were they said that was
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.960]  mentally ill because the fbi wouldn't do that in america so they grabbed him electro shock
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.960]  therapy him for about six months he didn't know who he was and he was so depressed about it they
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.240]  say he committed suicide so um you know they could grab me electro shock me six months put me on

[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:11.200]  i'm like a cage desperate animal just clawing trying to get out we're being poisoned we're
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.600]  being killed the globalist brag they've set up a scientific dictatorship they're trying to mop
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:20.240]  up freedom trying to get rid of our families promoting the end of families it's just pure
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:26.480]  evil and they admit the fluorides killing us they admit the GMO is sterilizing us they're coming
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:33.120]  out with hundreds of new GMO crops well there's no way to escape it they're attacking us at every
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:42.960]  level and it's just so horrible and and i know it sounds crazy to an uninformed person to say
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.880]  elements of the government stage 9-11 but then you look at the facts it's all right there
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.640]  i mean it's crazy to say the government would ship guns into mexico to blame the second amendment
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.480]  or would have troops growing the opium but when it came out they were they just decided to hide it
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.040]  in plain view and have the troops talk about how it was patriotic to grow opium and ship it into
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:10.880]  america and the caller brings up the al-qaeda there are hundreds of articles where they just say oh
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:16.640]  yeah al-qaeda is being armed by nato but in saudi arabia and well yeah and they but they're the good
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.920]  guys and yeah they're blowing up the military bases and stuff and Assad's bad though what we're
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:27.360]  doing is humanitarian because they just know the average americans seen so many hollywood movies where
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.440]  anybody in the middle east needs to be killed because you know because chuck norris has taken
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:36.240]  them out or whatever i know chuck's a listener been on the show before writes about me and

[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:22.800]  he's um the ceo and he states in this article that you know we thank you for flying with us
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:28.800]  and we're happy for your business but we just want to let you know that the tsa isn't we don't

[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:42.800]  have any control over that and listen the tsa has caused a revolt and in europe similar things
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:48.480]  it's unifying everybody because and they know it's going to make us mad they've got to break us to

[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:14.000]  country but that's what they want i'm sorry finish your story so in this article it says now
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.840]  that they're pleased to say that the tsa has launched a new risk-based pre-screening initiative
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:27.120]  where you voluntarily give your information to be a part of the expedited program which would then
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:33.360]  allow you to not have to remove your shoes belts jackets yeah but but that's a lie too it it says
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.720]  they may let you it's still just another lane and then the groping will continue they're gonna have
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:45.440]  three levels full rape room open grope and then a special lane for good globalists but still they
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:50.960]  may drag you out so yeah it's it's hurting you into the next level of slavery we're on the march

[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.200]  up that facebook thing people can hear the voice of a zombie you want to hear the voice of a zombie
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.480]  this is this is everything that we're diametrically opposed to this is an ad for their face scanning
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.240]  to buy and sell they give you discounts if you let them track your whole background and your
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.800]  whole database and tell you what you should buy because the computer knows which who you are in
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.400]  the profile just like they're tracking you and know where you're going to go with your cell
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:57.440]  phone before you go there they know you're going to go to that steakhouse to evolve the check-in

[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:18.720]  participants in a matter just like hitler said first you get the women then you've got the children
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:26.960]  so follow the women's not that women are weak or bad it's that evil always targets women first

[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:02.080]  in every culture women are the heart women buy over 80 percent of the goods that's why most

[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:11.320]  So they filter faster
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.320]  You don't have to prime these
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.320]  The first time you use them
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:16.320]  It's amazing

[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:11.720]  alright ladies and gentlemen we're back here I took a little break I'm gonna try
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:18.480]  to cover this news because every time I'm at an airport or on the street and
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:21.920]  somebody's in a uniform everyone runs up and says oh I want to thank you for your
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.320]  service I want to thank you for your service and they just do it because it
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:30.080]  makes them feel good like they're doing the right thing meanwhile Americans
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:34.600]  hold less passports than anybody else in the world Americans in major polls I
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:37.480]  have a new one today could care less about what's happening in the world or
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:43.120]  the military in real polls they could care less about you and our military is
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:46.560]  not our military it's openly run by foreign banks they tell our military
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:53.520]  that NATO and the UN run our military the bankers brag they've captured our
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:56.680]  country so I thought I would break down for you why the troops are committing
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:02.520]  suicide in mass Americans tune out of Afghan war is fighting rages on
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:07.200]  associated press and it goes through the fact it was once president Barack
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.680]  Obama's war of necessity now it's America's forgotten war yeah because they
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:15.840]  said the war ended you just tell people it ended and they didn't end but you
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.840]  know you tell people burning down the Waco church and an assault and they go
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:23.280]  well it didn't assault they tell you tazoring you for no reason isn't torture
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.200]  but it is an Afghan conflict generates barely a whisper on the US presidential
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:33.000]  campaign trail it's not a hot topic at the office water cooler or in the halls
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.200]  of Congress even though there are 80,000 American troops not to mention more
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.080]  contractors than that they're still fighting here and dying at a rate of
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:48.520]  one a day you got to grow the opium and it goes on to show public opinion against
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:52.320]  it but don't really care now I thought I just mentioned that because I happen to
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:59.600]  have military personnel and veteran suicide prevention numbers here from AFSP
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:08.040]  and it goes over the rise in suicides in the last ten years it's been steadily
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:18.600]  steadily rising it's been steadily steadily rising there are more people
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:22.640]  committing suicide that are dying in all the conflicts now let me explain what
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.920]  this is it's a cocktail of things they're killing a lot of officers and
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:34.600]  investigators dragging them the mercenaries and people are who report on
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:39.040]  corruption that's that's a small part of it but that's part of the numbers they
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:44.280]  always call it suicide when they shoot you in the head in your trailer a lot of
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:48.720]  troops are doing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 tours their families are falling apart their
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:52.240]  paychecks won't pay for things they feel bad about what they've done so they're
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:56.920]  committing suicide I mean if you feel bad about military operations you know
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:00.960]  you feel terrible no matter what the propaganda is no matter you know how
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.360]  you've been lied to you wake up it's a fraud and you kind of have a self
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:08.280]  disposal switch your body says you're not good for the tribe kill yourself your
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:13.040]  mind doesn't you get depressed when you could repent get out of it like Pat
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:17.040]  Tillman was going to do and speak out against it but instead you just kill
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:21.560]  yourselves not a good idea you should kill yourself politically getting the
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:26.160]  word out busting your butt to tell the truth you should make it right if you've
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:29.960]  had an abortion and you know it's wrong now go out and fight to save lives of
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:35.040]  other children go out and adopt children don't kill yourself that's a cop out
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:43.560]  that's a coward's way out now the biggest reason that troops are committing suicide
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:47.000]  because I've gone and looked at most these cases so they've been in two three
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.200]  four five six seven eight tours which they wouldn't even do in World War two
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:53.920]  make you serve more than one tour a lot of it really stressful door-to-door type
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:58.520]  stuff it's really abusive policing stuff where you're hated we're seeing dead
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:06.000]  kids it's horrible and so what's happening is they're putting them on
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:12.160]  Prozac and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other experimental drugs
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:18.720]  other experimental drugs and I have an article here called the Marshall plan
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:24.320]  at a wired magazine the 40 years the man behind Pentagon insiders called Yoda
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:28.120]  has foreseen the future of war and he says in the future it won't be what
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:32.640]  weapons but what drugs the troops are on they're experimenting with a bunch of
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.720]  psychotropic viral injections that reprogram the brain you name it and in
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.160]  most of the suicide cases there because I've gone and looked up a bunch of them
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:46.680]  they were under psychiatric care and sent back out and now their impulse
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.960]  control is removed by the drugs and that's why they're killing themselves and
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:56.000]  others I mean the Prozac insert says it increases suicide psychotic activities
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:02.480]  so that's what's going on here we'll be back hello this is Ty Bollinger author

[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:53.760]  the previous record in the Vietnam era of suicide you can look up the numbers
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:55:01.880]  that's a sign that evil runs this country and the all the folks out there
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:08.880]  like hire a warrior do this and that no we need to end these evil wars and we
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:14.280]  need to get them off of big pharma mind control drugs I mean the head futurist at
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:20.880]  the army they went to Pentagon Andrew Marshall a futurist he's the one that

[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:50.360]  popping performance pills all that was before the war on terror and they go
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:57.120]  over all of this is an article from 2003 by the way nine years ago okay so
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:02.360]  everything you see in the newborn movie when I saw that a few nights ago with the
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:06.640]  crew it totally freaked me out because everything in it was real programs just
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:12.120]  pieces of it and they were showing you what they're really doing including in
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:16.520]  the 21st century they don't just give you pills they inject you with viruses
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:26.880]  that will go in and destroy the areas of the brain that give you what you'd call
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.600]  the conscience to not kill a child or not or or the natural governor to where
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:36.080]  you can't run 50 miles because you might have a heart attack they just remove
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:40.040]  that and they have injected troops with it they injected troops special forces
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:44.360]  with microchips a decade ago I talked to family about it and when I brought it
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:48.040]  back up just the fact that I'd mentioned that family told me that they figured
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:54.360]  out who it was and gotten their face now that person won't even talk to me so
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:58.120]  they put microchips in them I mean it's so far down the road ladies and
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:02.280]  gentlemen and they're using them like machines that they're using them till
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.800]  the wheels come off the globalist hate the military and they know that they're
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:10.920]  a bunch of drugged up overused people when they come back so they either make
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:14.760]  them cops to oppress us or they're saying they're the main enemy put them all
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:20.720]  in prison you know they're terrorist and I've got a National Guard article here
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:24.880]  where they're saying the homeland is the biggest threat in the National Guard
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:30.480]  magazine and that the returning veterans are the biggest threat so here's the
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:34.040]  military being taught that they are the terrorists in their own magazine a
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:38.080]  Don wrote a story about it in June actually saw it doing some research this
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:46.320]  morning and reprinted it can't find it now but my main point is this here's an
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:50.920]  RT article US Army grants 3 million for anti-suicide nasal spray research and
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:56.840]  it's a very powerful drug chemical that basically turns them into automatons but
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:01.040]  they shoot up their nose and so they're just turning the troops into a bunch of
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:04.360]  drugheads who they can then say are mental patients or whatever down the
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:11.560]  road they know exactly what they're doing because the globalist absolutely hate
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:14.560]  America and hate our military they hate them so much they're gonna use them to
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:18.880]  take over the world while they soft kill them and then separately you can pull
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:23.480]  this up CBS News stress vaccine don't worry shot us on the way says doctors
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:26.640]  they already are giving these are the troops that again make them where they
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:29.840]  don't feel bad about what they're doing and they're now saying that oh don't
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:32.880]  worry we're gonna give you a shot where you won't feel bad anymore they're
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:37.240]  turning them literally into living zombies I mean we're living in a
[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:51.120]  nightmare movie you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today the worst
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:54.920]  drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:59.120]  hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:03.400]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:07.640]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:11.200]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:15.280]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:19.280]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:22.800]  increases e-foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:26.360]  supply I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:29.800]  known this was coming you know about their delicious long-term storeable
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:33.680]  foods the fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:37.160]  stores for 25 years you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising

[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:19.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:23.480]  Alex Jones
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:38.320]  you know at about 40 after the last hour I had to go off air and it wasn't
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.960]  because I was mad at my crew because they couldn't find a three-minute
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:47.200]  commercial to play so I could take a break I was mad because I have all this
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:50.880]  data on how they're drugging the troops killing the troops hurting them and it
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:54.360]  makes me angry that they talk all day about how much they love the troops
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:59.120]  when they actually hate them when they're using them up like a natural
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:02.920]  resource and they're planning to play them off against us in a civil war and
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:06.120]  then I've got to articulate all this and I've got all these documents and
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:11.080]  articles about how they're giving them cancer injections how they're in letting
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.520]  them die of DU they're injecting them with viruses that are actually nanotech
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:21.160]  that reprogram the brain and then they've got movies out the the born
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:24.840]  legacy showing what's real and then I've got all the government documents that
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:29.800]  are public who knows what is classified and it just gets crazier and crazier and
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.760]  crazier and then I know I sound like a crazy person on air to someone who's
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:39.120]  uninformed it's a nightmare it's a bit and then I'm all shitting ready to go
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:43.080]  and then I start joking around about the Facebook thing and then I lose my
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:50.320]  thoughts and I just get angry and I'll tell you it's because I'm like a raccoon
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:54.200]  that's been put in a cage
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:02:04.400]  and thrown into a calp on to be killed and the raccoon is up there clawing and
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:11.840]  scraping and trying to get out and you can see it under about six inches of
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:15.200]  water trying to poke its nose out trying to try to get to the surface and he
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.880]  finally see it give up after a while and I just am so tired of watching people in
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:23.240]  a zombie state getting poisoned and killed and little kids that are getting
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:26.320]  sick and dying of cancer and all the diabetes and all the diseases and all
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:31.160]  the curses and all the deformities and all the stuff that's happening and I and
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:35.160]  the globalist are bragging how they did it and I and I see them arming against
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:40.280]  us and it's just if people knew what I knew and did the research and found out
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:44.840]  I wasn't making this up there's no way any of you would put up with this even if
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:54.920]  you were cowards because a coward would go wow we're doomed if we don't resist
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:03:04.200]  this and then I feel guilty just constantly because I'm a still a
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:09.880]  little bit worldly and do still enjoy status and money and things like that
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:13.040]  and really there's nothing wrong with that having a little bit of money and
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:15.920]  status because it gives you a little bit of protection but you know you're
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:21.600]  rationalized but you still feel bad like you're not doing enough that's why
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.960]  people call up and say oh you're doing such a great job it's like getting
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.920]  punched in the nose man
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:35.360]  because the callers are so sweet and so good and it just reminds me of the
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:39.800]  general public being abused by the New World Order every time I look at my
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.880]  youngest daughter who's so innocent so full of good and so I just I think about
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:48.080]  what the globalists are doing to little children and that with the GMO and the
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:52.320]  vaccines in the fluoride and how they know it and I think about city councils
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:55.680]  I've seen on video all over the country laughing at medical doctors that come in
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:02.520]  and warn them those idiot city council people are gonna have their wives and
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.080]  husbands and kids die young but they're so unhuman and dumbed down and like
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:13.000]  biological Android jellyfish they kind of get into the pageant of their wife or
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.960]  husband or kids dying and the media attention and the the balloons and the
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.480]  and the parties and the race for the cure and everything and they don't even
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:25.680]  care they kind of like being killed they kind of like their family dying
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:32.840]  they're like demonic jellyfish is the best way to describe it there are people
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:37.080]  who want to be judged and want to be destroyed and want the globalists to
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:42.200]  fly over with drones and release an engineered human mouse pox so that 98
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:46.080]  percent of them can flop around dying and then when they do that if they go to
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:50.960]  that level which I know is part of their plan the survivors will still worship
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:55.800]  the killers it'll even though it's like yeah that the plane the drone flow over
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:03.960]  and did it it won't matter I mean it's just it's unbelievable if you want an

[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:15.960]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:19.880]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science

[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:34.440]  Alex Jones
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:38.720]  ladies and gentlemen we're going to continue with your calls and some other
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:43.800]  very important news from info wars.com prisonplanet.com if you just joined us
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:48.680]  towards the end of the last hour I went over the numbers of all-time record
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:55.320]  suicides for the US military across the board and it's not just soldiers that
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:09:00.200]  are in combat it's it's it's across the spectrum it's contractors you name it
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:07.560]  and it's because when they ask any questions or go get medical checkups
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:11.600]  they're pushing all sorts of experimental drugs mind control drugs that's in
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:16.360]  the news on them but also serotonin reuptake inhibitors that were developed
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:21.680]  actually in CIA mind control programs you can look that up and cause massive
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:28.200]  psychotic breaks massive increases in suicide mass killings that's on the drug
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:33.200]  inserts Eli Lilly covered up that fact in the 80s late 70s early 80s when they
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:37.320]  were getting it approved in 1981 the massive what 15-fold increase in
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:40.840]  suicide and psychotic activity it's not a good idea to give people that are a
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:45.800]  combat veterans of three four five six tours a drug like that because they're
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:48.800]  gonna start wanting to kill their family when their wife's getting in their face
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:54.120]  so they just set a kill on their family they go kill themselves that's what I've
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:59.120]  looked at some of the crime files that are online some quite a few and in most
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:03.800]  cases they were under psychiatric care on drugs and you give somebody on a
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:09.840]  loose and a gen that's a trained killer it's bad news they're killing
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:13.640]  themselves the good news is they're not killing their families or those around
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:20.440]  them and so that's what's going on and let me just explain something here
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:28.480]  earlier I read an article about how the average person does not care about the
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:32.760]  war and is sick of hearing about the war that's out of the Associated Press
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:36.640]  Americans to not have Afghan war is fighting rages on let's get something
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:40.960]  straight these people that run over when they see somebody in a uniform and say
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:46.720]  oh thank you so much for your service and all this that's something they do that
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:51.880]  they think the troops want to hear and some of them do it for good reasons a
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:55.600]  lot of them do it just because it makes them feel politically correct and good
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:59.360]  but the women winning the volleyball thing always thanking the troops now I'd
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:02.920]  be shocked if she said and let's get you know the troops their pensions that
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:08.840]  were stolen by by provincial they don't have a new hero but because you're
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:11.240]  actually gonna care about somebody you better actually know what help they
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:14.720]  need that's why I'm in an airport on the street and people come over to guys in
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:19.720]  uniform maybe if they're new recruits privates they like it but you can see
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:22.800]  if it's a sergeant or somebody that you know it's been in a long time and the
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:25.080]  people come over they're like oh thank you you could tell it's like a punch in
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:28.840]  the stomach they don't want to hear how great they are they've been over there
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:32.760]  growing opium they've been over there cleaning up little kids guts they've been
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:36.800]  over there watching people get fragged who speak out against Al Qaeda being run
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:40.840]  by the West they know Pat Kelman was murdered by the government they don't
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:44.000]  want you telling them how great they are okay let me just give you a little
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.160]  newsflash okay I mean give me let me just give you a little newsflash when
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.240]  they go to the local football game and and they're in plain clothes and the
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:55.640]  principal comes out and talks about everybody points at them using them for
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:59.080]  a propaganda point because the principal and the coach likes to play like
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:03.440]  their army scyop officers and promote the war effort like America is really in a
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:07.280]  war America's in a war with globalists that took it over not against a bunch of
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:12.680]  jihadis the globalists run let me tell you the troops don't like that okay they
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:20.360]  don't like it I know them but let me just get something straight to everybody
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:25.560]  the New World Order hates the military and they hate conservatives and
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:28.960]  libertarians and constitutionalists and all their manual show that that we
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:34.160]  broke that the media admits are real and the military's depressed training for
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:37.840]  urban warfare they're depressed training to put political dissidents in jail
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:41.600]  they're depressed training for reeducation camps declassified in
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:45.400]  America you think that'd be big news three months later if they hadn't been
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:58.320]  admitted any mainstream news you think that the media would be forced to cover
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:02.080]  something like that so let's get something straight our government for
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:09.800]  at least at least 70 years has tested on our troops and killed them in
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:21.280]  countless declassified studies radiation biologicals Kim's everything again my
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:25.120]  dad told the story he was asking a professor at UT in biology well why
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:28.680]  don't they use pigs and monkeys for these nuclear tests why do they use
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:33.400]  soldiers the professor looked at him and said because soldiers are cheaper than
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:42.960]  pigs and monkeys the globalist are bound in one thing they look at all of us is
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:50.800]  dumb pathetic animals as cattle as scum as meat on the table to be eaten they
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:56.360]  are a culture across the board the Chinese elite the European elite the
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:03.280]  North American elite African elite Latin American elite Jewish elite Japanese
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:10.120]  elite they're all the same they compete with each other over who's the most
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:15.120]  ruthless that's what Machiavelli is all about and when you sit here like a naive
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:21.360]  child or people almost think it's it's a form of hospitality to be chumps that
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:31.720]  it's a form of hospitality to be run over to be abused to be used I think it's
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:40.400]  cute I think it's cool I think it's fun because they're delusional people think
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:44.400]  that if they imagine something it's not like what is but what is public opinion
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.880]  it's not like what is the right thing to do it's like what would what are other
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:52.480]  people doing and once you get into that packed mode of like lemmings going off
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:55.820]  the edge of a cliff and we're a higher order of life folks than lemmings and
[02:14:55.820 --> 02:15:00.240]  sheep I've watched myself I'll be gone to an airport and hopped out of the
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:05.400]  scanner and 20 people behind me will opt out but if I sit there and watch and
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:10.280]  nobody's opting out nobody opts out I mean that's scary folks that you can
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:15.720]  opt out then everybody behind you is gonna opt out by the way they couldn't
[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:18.840]  they'd have to stop the whole line if everybody opted out that's why we were
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:21.960]  gonna have national opt-out day they shut it down for a week and search nobody
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:25.640]  because they didn't want you to see the power you had we have that clip ready
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:30.640]  here's a clip is it bugs life or ants I forget the name
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:35.920]  oh ants
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:43.440]  I mean they know what they're doing so let's get this straight the people running
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:48.640]  things are eugenicist which is a scientific amalgamation of basically a
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:52.840]  psychopathic religion is really a religion that they're the elite god
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:57.120]  class who will ascend and get all the high-tech and we're animals who are too
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:04.520]  dumb and we're gonna be killed that is the heart of the new world order that is
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:15.760]  what the new world order stands for that's what the new world order is and
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:20.080]  people are like oh just be positive about it'll be okay no the whole thing is
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:24.960]  sinister the whole thing is abusive the whole thing is evil evil evil evil
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:30.520]  people wicked beyond imagination are in control and there's still a lot of good
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:33.920]  people we still have our basic morals that tortures wrong secret arrest is
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:37.280]  wrong warrantless wiretapping is wrong but you notice the system just keeps
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:41.280]  promoting it like it's good and putting heroes on TV that do it so that their
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:44.600]  own minions will then carry it out it doesn't matter if they commit suicide
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:51.760]  down the road because you give them drugs that make them commit suicide they
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:17:05.160]  know what they're doing they're fully aware of what they're doing and now
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:09.320]  they're coming out with nasal sprays with these hardcore chemicals that
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:14.960]  basically mind wipe the troops they're giving them amnesics they're giving them
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:22.720]  amphetamines they're giving them everything and of course it's only to
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:29.160]  make the suicide worse but now they're trying to absolutely end free will and
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:32.400]  they just roll out and say you don't expect if they're gonna inject you with
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.000]  a virus or even spray it on you they want people to opt in first be able to
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.600]  study them to see they're setting the precedent where they can give us drugs
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:43.200]  and things that openly kill us and then nobody gets in trouble oh we gave
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:47.000]  millions of hemophiliacs a drug that we knew had HIV and hepatitis in it big
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.080]  deal nobody gets in trouble
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:58.080]  oh big deal and now they come on go we got an antitrize stress vaccine you'll
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:02.680]  never be upset again yeah cuz you're gonna be an emotionalist zombie and but
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:06.000]  they just report it like it's oh look we got a new shot you'll never be depressed
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.480]  again they're already testing this on the troops I've confirmed it people are
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:16.400]  coming home folks and they do whatever their wife tells them they don't have
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:19.320]  fun at the football game anymore they're not even human anymore they just sit
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:24.600]  there and Bob go mow the yard yes ma'am

[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:45.320]  and yeah boys they're puny hmm puny say let's pretend this brain is a puny

[02:18:51.200 --> 02:19:11.520]  are you kidding how about this you let one ant stand up to us then they all
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:19.040]  might stand up those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one and if
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:25.440]  they ever figure that out there goes our way of life it's not about food it's
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:32.360]  about keeping those ants in line that's why we're going back does anybody else
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:35.080]  want to stay

[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:46.720]  inside the dash and a camera hooked up to the police Toyota said this about seven
[02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:50.000]  years ago but now it's coming and then they track you by the mile and tax you
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.080]  but for your safety you can hit a button it's like on star basically
[02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:56.720]  mandatory for everybody government star just I guess it is government motors
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:01.320]  and you admit the FBI listens to without warrants but it's fine and then it
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:05.700]  will actually shout orders or then take control of the car because they're
[02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:10.040]  proving they say as I told you they would do the Google cars are safer so see
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:17.000]  you can't drive it's public safety but you could pay extra insurance and maybe
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.480]  drive for now and all the new tech as the CIA director told you has stuff wired
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:26.680]  into it watching you tracking you smart meters they now admit interfacing with
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:31.600]  the stuff in your house all spying on you all criminal all seamlessly integrated
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:35.560]  by the Fortune 100 who openly meet at Bilderberg and openly are announcing
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:40.200]  world government and that they run al-qaeda in CFR magazine last week two
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:44.120]  weeks ago I mean it's just it's just all in your face world government total
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:49.160]  insanity Dan Badani working as one of the radio producers and video
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:52.440]  switchers in there did an excellent job along with John Bowne Chris Salonese
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:56.480]  and others he just ran him with this he said yeah it's all over the place look
[02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:02.480]  vets feel abandoned after secret drug experiments oh CNN now they just don't
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:08.160]  make him secret oh they have a new nasal spray that wipes their conscience and it
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:12.960]  helps them kill better and then they give them an anesthetic when they because
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:16.320]  they admit they go to villages and kill everyone that's been in the Ethic of
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:19.600]  Times Fox News they say that's a good thing but the troops don't feel good
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:23.000]  even though they were told it was good doesn't matter they've got a cocktail of
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.880]  several drugs one of them Halcyon it's they not gonna remember it's the drug
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:29.480]  they give you where it's partial sedation when they give it to you and rip
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:32.880]  your wisdom teeth out and you don't even remember it you can tell somebody on
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:37.480]  Halcyon hey go and to your house and give me your money it's basically like
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:45.880]  devil's breath oh jump off the cliff yeah yeah my dad's a dentist I've seen
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:49.040]  people assisting him doing wisdom teeth I used to be a dental assistant like 20
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:52.720]  years ago right out of high school for a couple years and I've seen it people on
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.160]  Halcyon don't even know who they are well the troops yeah you just killed a
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:59.440]  bunch of people we're gonna give you three times the regular dose and go in
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:02.520]  there we're gonna do some diagnostics you know what they do while they're on
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:07.040]  the Halcyon they give them an electro shock they have mobile filled units this
[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:11.160]  will be the NSA is going to be freaking I've talked to two separate special
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:17.040]  forces operators who had their memories wiped after they were given Halcyon and
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:20.240]  then shocked but then some of the technicians told them about it oh yeah
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:24.280]  oh yeah nothing like running blue lightning across the frontal lobe of
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:28.520]  the troops and then they're a little depressed when their IQ goes down we'll
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:35.920]  just put you on Prozac that makes you commit suicide yeah yeah that's how you
[02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:40.760]  support the troops that's right the government wouldn't hurt us they
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:45.720]  wouldn't do 9-11 they just killed 4,000 plus us foster children in radiation
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:49.080]  experiments it's on the Department of Energy's website but they wouldn't hurt

[02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:10.000]  with yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:13.120]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to
[02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:17.880]  deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario
[02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:22.480]  Sepaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the
[02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:26.600]  silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it
[02:31:26.600 --> 02:31:30.440]  also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to
[02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:35.320]  deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this includes the
[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:41.960]  eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:46.120]  be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at
[02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:53.280]  www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works as well

[02:31:59.960 --> 02:32:04.600]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:08.920]  the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:13.200]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:17.440]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[02:32:17.440 --> 02:32:21.000]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.120]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:29.120]  supply of foods from eat foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients
[02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:32.640]  increases eat foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your
[02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:36.160]  supply I recently increased my supply for me foods direct because we've all
[02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:39.600]  known this was coming you know about their delicious long-term storeable
[02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:43.480]  foods the fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it
[02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:46.920]  stores for 25 years you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising
[02:32:46.920 --> 02:32:52.560]  food cost don't wait call 800 409 5633 or go to eat foods direct com forward
[02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:58.120]  slash Alex call 800 409 5633 or eat foods direct com forward slash Alex you

[02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:42.800]  yeah words are very unnecessary we know we're living in tyranny a couple other
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:47.440]  news items here that I wanted to hit and when I see an article like this is on
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:50.480]  my brain works I remember the connections to it because they always
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:53.880]  come out and announce these tyrannies like it was just invented like we're
[02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:58.080]  the first to have special forces run checkpoints in our town you mean the
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:02.480]  first of 10,000 that have already been had it done this is out of Dartmouth
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:07.200]  newspaper Dartmouth researchers develop smart bracelets to track people's
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:11.680]  medical and brainwaves and everything well yeah and then we happen to have the
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:18.200]  backstory Bill Gates magic boredom measuring bracelets they want for public
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:21.400]  school children to track their heart rate brain rate and everything else so
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:25.040]  teachers can know if they're paying attention this is all part of the
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:30.480]  medicalization mind control takeover this guy is over researching the GMO at
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:35.400]  Monsanto he owns part of on how to engineer GMO to create gut problems then
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:41.080]  he dominates creating cures for the gut problems all the gut flora problems that
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:47.280]  GMO is causing he's also involved in weather weapons he gets tax money and
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:51.040]  then he runs the companies that do it you just look up they just dumped a bunch
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:55.200]  of sulfur dioxide on New Mexico and one of his big studies I mean this is this
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:58.600]  is a lunatic control freak and so I thought I would just mention that and
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:03.840]  again US testing talking cars to avoid crashes and congestion what they are is
[02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:08.960]  cars that surveil you with the police tracking you and taxing you and taking
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:13.080]  control of your car that's where everything's moving and now there it is
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:18.120]  in Reuters here's another one robot to throw the first pitch at Detroit Tigers
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:23.680]  game we're not against technology but the problem here is that it's all being
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:27.760]  backdoor engineered with Trojan horses to control us they're now coming out
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:33.200]  with synthetic ground police robots they'll follow orders they'll kill unarmed
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:36.800]  people they're coming out with autonomous drones that humans don't control
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:41.240]  that the globalist can program they've said at MIT in DARPA the globalists that
[02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:46.000]  run our country that this is what they want humans out of the equation Bill
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  Joy said 12 years ago he said owner of Sun Microsystems he said I was at a
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  meeting with 200 top tech people and owners billionaires and we discussed do
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:01.440]  we kill everybody or do we just let them kind of play games and have fun and let
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:04.640]  robots run everything and the consensus was we're probably just gonna kill
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:09.960]  everybody and then he quotes the Unabomber who'd been in CIA mind control
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:14.800]  that's LA Times Theodore Kaczynski was in the MK Ultra program this stuff's real
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:19.760]  and he starts quoting him that's why Kaczynski went wild it was actually in
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:23.280]  his writings saying this was all coming I mean this is this is this is the big
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:28.200]  enchilada this is the big issue now shifting gears we have the executive
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:33.080]  director of Channel Austin what has been access television in Austin Linda
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:39.360]  Latowski who I've known I don't know for about a decade or so for the 40th
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:43.320]  anniversary of access television and access began in Austin Texas so this is
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:47.720]  important everywhere we'll give you a few tips here on air I started out in 1995
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:52.680]  going and taking the classes and stuff got on air and I guess because I was
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:57.320]  only on to the people shows until 96 as a producer in 96 six months later got a
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:01.040]  radio show a year later got syndicated but I stayed still on access till about
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:05.280]  six seven years ago I'd go down there some but 20 30 fans would show up and so
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:09.440]  I just couldn't be there anymore but we use it as a studio sometime great folks
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:14.200]  but even though I was pretty much gone seven eight years ago I discovered I'm
[02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:17.160]  gonna talk about this first Linda I discovered because she hadn't been there
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:21.360]  in years she'd been there early on that there was fraud going on they were
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:23.800]  bringing in enough money to run it the claiming they were gonna shut it down
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:28.680]  basically with operatives in government and media that wanted it gone and I
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:32.520]  basically ran an investigation on them recorded them did some stuff and we had
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:36.400]  sent the director to prison but it went a lot higher than that but the
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:40.640]  investigation got killed because it was city-run now Linda you know came in
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:44.200]  cleaned the whole thing up stopped the violation of our First Amendment and all
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:47.720]  the things that were going on it was pretty darn sorted they're trying to
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:51.160]  get rid of it now basically but I wanted to advertise that if you want to go
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:54.280]  somewhere and immediately air documentaries eclipse of things do
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:57.880]  your own show don't want to be on there just put an image up talk over it get
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:01.520]  down there Austin access has hundreds of thousands of viewers in the aggregate
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:05.960]  you do a show once a layer ten times or so after we take our nightly news show
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:09.680]  and John bound takes it down there as a producer and puts it on as a service to
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:14.120]  Austin a huge viewership you need to get down there because the more members it
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:18.080]  has they try to run everybody off but Linda help keep it together the plan
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:21.600]  was to get you basically shut it down from our analysis from our research
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:25.560]  that's what it looked like was happening but but but just recap for folks how
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:29.360]  many years ago was that that I hired the private investigator and stuck around and
[02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:37.080]  caught him I believe it started in 2004 and he went on trial 2006 the city audit
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:42.400]  department ran an investigation based on what you uncovered and they found what
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:45.080]  how many hundreds of thousands was it missing three hundred and fifty two
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:50.000]  thousand dollars he stole convicted of that he was convicted of that seven
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:54.200]  years to Huntsville prison but he only served 15 months
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:59.600]  Huntsville that's an enjoyable prison in East Texas exactly no air conditioning
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:04.800]  most of the time yeah but it was a severe sentence for a white-collar crime
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:11.040]  but he was not ordered to pay any restitution even though this was funds
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:14.600]  for the community he paid nothing nothing in restitution well you know why
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:19.840]  because I mean the word as well it our research shows it was not just him that
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:27.000]  was involved that's true the the focus of the investigation was on him as a as
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:32.920]  that he acted alone even though there was there was a lot of speculation that
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:36.960]  some board members were in on this as well well it wasn't just that it went
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:40.760]  into the city and that's why they killed it real quick and then once they can say
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:43.840]  he's an ex-con and they can try to discredit everything but it was pretty
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:49.600]  amazing he he actually at a at a telecommunications meeting came up to
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:53.440]  me and threatened me and I said I said I said look what I do to the government
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:57.320]  every day buddy you think that's gonna work I said now I'm coming after you
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:00.720]  that's when I actually pulled the trigger and really really focused on him
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:05.160]  I was like you're gonna threaten me I think without you Alex and he never
[02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:08.440]  would have come down I mean they would never would have brought him down and I
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:12.800]  don't believe that the city would have conducted such an in-depth investigation
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:17.600]  through the audit well I just want to say people always think these bullies are
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:20.720]  invincible until you actually confront them it's like fast and furious or
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:25.320]  anything we just got to keep pushing well he told me he said I will kill you
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:29.360]  and I said well go ahead and try and I said that's it now I'm gonna get you he
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:35.440]  wasn't ex-marine and a bookkeeper and it was kind of an unusual circumstance that
[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:39.160]  he was actually running the play let's see I use violence of info war and I
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:43.920]  told him I said I said now I'm coming after you and you did I mean you went
[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:48.200]  before City Council you went before the Telecommunications Commission you made
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:53.600]  it public you brought it into the light and I think people were it was I guess
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:59.400]  it was your power or your well it's not even that it's just the power of light
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:04.400]  on it you know it was your celebrity your notoriety your reputation those all of
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:08.280]  those things added up to make it happen that that's I didn't really follow he
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:14.400]  played guilty didn't he finally no no I don't believe he did I was just going
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:19.880]  for memory yeah he he showed no remorse whatsoever when he was called to testify
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:25.560]  there was a number of us there in the courtroom he did not ever say he was
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:30.920]  sorry he never offered to pay anything back he used most of the money for like
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:36.320]  University of Texas football tickets he flew to all the away games he had cable
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:40.600]  and bought a house and I mean all sorts of stuff so it was kind of a sad
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:45.680]  circumstance that you're operating this nonprofit corporation that's you know
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:49.720]  helping hundreds if not thousands of people in the community and then you're
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:54.080]  stealing from it that was just sad well he came out in the hall that day there
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:56.760]  even a few people behind him and I saw made a big issue out of it was kind of
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:59.640]  like when Lionel Chetwin who was in the Bush administration came in a bathroom
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:04.400]  in Hollywood or he went on the conspiracy theory show and conspiracy
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:07.680]  zone with Kevin Nealon and he said we're gonna get you we're gonna you know take
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.960]  you out I said and I said you're an idiot people behind you just heard that
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:14.120]  he went oh I'm just joking I'm just joking and his lawyers threatened me and
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:18.120]  I said I've got witnesses I've got the workers from the show coming in to get
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:22.280]  us to go on TV so they had to back off that was that was pretty funny that's
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:25.920]  what these guys do it's like they don't understand this goes two ways you know I
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:29.000]  mean you know I guess they're just used to the general public I wish the public
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.880]  wasn't like that when someone threatens them they just cower down to it I
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:36.520]  immediately just run around like a chicken on my head go but enough about
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:39.520]  that the point is we fought you fought that's now eight years ago hard to
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:43.240]  believe yeah I say six seven seven and a half years ago so I was right seven and
[02:42:43.240 --> 02:42:46.840]  a half years ago hard to believe time has moved that fast they're using other
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:51.560]  strategies I know Time Warner you even recently has tried to get my shows off
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:56.600]  the air you know I'm mad about things but I mean you told me about that
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:43:00.120]  offer you so we could talk about it but I mean there's no point everybody should
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:05.040]  use access all over the country tell people where access is today and where
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:08.360]  some of the best spots in the country are and how easy it is to get on air the
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:12.880]  very best spot in the whole country is Austin Texas and you're right we have
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:18.360]  the longest continually running public access channel in the universe it's where
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:22.960]  Robert Rodriguez got started with Rick Linklater Rick Linklater and Alex
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:27.320]  Jones as well as thousands of other people were in the tens of thousands now
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:31.680]  of folks who've used it over 40 years there's also Manhattan has a really
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:36.800]  strong access center but over 60 public access stations in the state of
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:42.440]  California have closed their doors and in Texas Dallas closed their doors
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:48.440]  because of a lack of information in a federal law so basically there is no
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:53.360]  more support for operations any longer that the public access the non-prime and
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:57.560]  to be clear if the cable is was given a monopoly in the past right a few cents
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:01.640]  out of the bill would go to give citizens an electronic soapbox exactly
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:07.520]  and it's true and and and and C-span came out of that so much more that's all
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:11.760]  going the way of the goonie bird because of AT&T they did not when they went
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:16.400]  decided to go into the video service they did not want to have to go and
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:20.160]  negotiate with each individual municipality and without making you
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:25.120]  enemies I mean I mean even recently they're like we don't like that you
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:28.680]  know he's got a show already and it's commercial that he's on access well
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:32.480]  yeah but it's my show we cut out the ads my information on access that's right
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:36.120]  I mean the point is all over the country they don't want me on it's the thing
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:41.040]  about about public access that's so critical is one it's not mainstream
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:45.120]  media you have the First Amendment right to free speech Alex and you should be
[02:44:45.120 --> 02:44:49.240]  able to say whatever you want as long as you don't break any federal state or
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:52.320]  local long as you don't have a call to action to kill somebody or if you say
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:56.480]  hey you know come by my car at this address exactly or you don't libel or
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:00.280]  slander anyone that's proven or you don't put anything obscene on the and
[02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:02.840]  that have to be adjudicated other than the obscene as we have standards for that
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:07.080]  yeah let's expand on that then tell us the number of the phone number how easy
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:10.480]  it is to go down there and get a producer license the very best way is to go to
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:17.120]  our website which is channel Austin dot org you can sign up as a as a user and
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:21.320]  then come to our intro session which is an orientation we have every Monday
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:27.120]  night at 7 p.m. except holidays and now the first Saturday of every month at
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:31.640]  11 a.m. it lasts about an hour and then you can learn everything you need to know
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:36.720]  about how to take the training how to get you know certified in the use of
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:41.480]  millions of dollars worth of equipment you can use absolutely free of charge
[02:45:41.480 --> 02:45:46.560]  and borrow it as long as you put the content on the air first and then you
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:50.080]  could do it it's amazing it's amazing and I want all the Austin info warriors
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:54.160]  to go down there because they're gonna try to shut it down next year we need to
[02:45:54.160 --> 02:45:56.840]  get a bunch of new blood in there because that's what's kept it alive and
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:00.800]  again I wish that I know Rick Linklater is a great guy Rodriguez is I guess an
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:04.520]  okay guy I don't like me too much but the point is you know folks like that I
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:07.560]  think they should come to the support of access because it helped give them a
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:11.400]  launchpad what about other people that need a launchpad but not just a launchpad
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:17.360]  for media for free speech everybody should use this 40-year venue exact but
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:20.760]  I think it's funny that the year that the city's trying to shut it down is the
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:24.120]  year it turns 40 and there's some kind of magic about that people aren't gonna
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:28.080]  want to shut it down that's correct it's unfortunate because all these years
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:31.920]  everyone said oh taxpayer dollars are going for these crazy people on this
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:36.600]  channel at why do my taxpayer dollars have to pay for this and all these years
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:42.040]  that was absolutely not true now we have to focus on how we can have sustainable
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:47.240]  funding to stay alive to at least have folks there to help you out to offer
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:52.320]  classes and to bring in other nonprofits that need that need a platform just I
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:58.080]  mean I have access to a hyper local distribution on the channel so we always
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:03.540]  see it as something that's about your community by your community and for your
[02:47:03.540 --> 02:47:06.240]  community sure and most people are trying to put stuff on YouTube they're
[02:47:06.240 --> 02:47:10.360]  getting a few thousand views I remember more than a decade ago they actually did
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:13.880]  a time-warnered thing I saw in the Chronicle and it was showing numbers and
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:16.720]  the one reason they were getting upset about my show that I was doing each
[02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:20.360]  number we got a radio and I was talking about the access show as well it had
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:23.720]  sometimes over a hundred thousand viewers and in Austin that was really
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:27.200]  freaking people out and that was kind of in the heyday of access but it still has
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:31.600]  a big audience because people are surfing through and if it's you know some
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:34.800]  preacher with bad audio people just go right through but if you're if you're
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:38.760]  there talking about issues you can read and again there's all sorts of access
[02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:42.520]  facilities around the country you could shoot the video at home edited at home
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:47.240]  just go play it there because it it's a venue to reach people that aren't getting
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:50.960]  their news online but it's also a way to breathe life into access television
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:56.440]  exactly and we also now we stream 24-7 so it's not just your local community but
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:00.920]  an international community and the thing about you Alex is to try and prove a
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:07.000]  point you were on in Lakeway and a cable on Time Warner cable in Lakeway when they
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:13.760]  took away public access the channels in Lakeway we had 200 phone calls in the
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:18.280]  first hour that your show did not air that day and so that gives I mean to
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:22.920]  receive that many phone calls flooding the lines is unbelievable that's when we
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:27.000]  knew that people were watching public access because of your show and the fact
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.720]  that they took it off the air yeah and that's just a tiny community outside
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:34.280]  Austin I mean access used to go into all a bunch of communities around us but
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:37.600]  but it's just in Austin now but Austin's gotten so much bigger so it's still a
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:43.320]  huge audience that's correct well so tell us what's the numbers I mean what's
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:47.280]  the scoop 40 years they're shutting them down everywhere just having a
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:51.080]  constituency's what keeps them on what else can we do to keep Austin access and
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:56.360]  others on we have a lot of events planned for this year and better in Austin so
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:49:00.360]  for your for your listeners the folks in Austin we we've definitely need support
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:06.840]  there for nationally we need to we need support from both sides of the aisle to
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:11.720]  support what's called the CAP Act which is the Community Access Preservation Act
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:17.560]  which we have a bunch of Democrats who have put forward the bill sponsored the
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:21.240]  bill but we only have one occasional good thing they've done that's good that's
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:27.600]  correct but it would change three words in a federal law that would allow for
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:34.120]  operation funds so let me just give you an idea in Austin Texas there is 1.2 to
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:41.520]  1.8 million dollars a year available through the video providers for use for
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:47.960]  capital expenditures but zero for operations so if three words in the
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:54.520]  national law was changed to read any any funds could be used for any purpose
[02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:59.120]  then we would have absolutely the money needed as would every other access
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:03.840]  station in the country well and I think access if they have to you've done a
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:06.800]  lot of things trying to open it up getting the streaming on the web a lot
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:10.800]  of other community partnership you tried to get those so-called low-watt FM's
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:14.080]  when they court was saying hey you can't have community radio they said okay
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:16.600]  we'll get out some little licenses but they never really gave those out that's
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:20.560]  correct imagine if you guys had a hundred watt FM for real community radio as
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:24.760]  well and we are looking at that actually Prometheus radio is saying that they're
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:28.480]  out of Philadelphia and they help nonprofit organizations raise the
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:32.760]  antenna and they are supposed to be releasing some more low-powered license
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:36.240]  but instead they gave them all as repeaters to commercial stations that's
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:40.160]  true but there are a few left in our zip code so we are looking at that and
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:43.040]  again I'm not against commercial stations getting a you know they're an AM
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:46.720]  getting an FM but those were slotted for community stations that's correct my
[02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:50.120]  problem is is they'll have to be in communist stations most community was
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:53.240]  turned out to be just communist Ford Foundation stations what we need is real
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:57.640]  access radio stations where it's whoever I mean that's what we need is whoever and
[02:50:57.640 --> 02:51:03.720]  you watch those stations will dominate we'll be back Alex Jones here with a
[02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:07.600]  great way to beat the blackouts get off the grid and generate your own supply
[02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:10.880]  of electrical power folks with what's been going on in this country I don't
[02:51:10.880 --> 02:51:14.360]  have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is that's in
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:18.200]  the mainstream news every day millions of people have lost their power in the
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:22.120]  last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the
[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:26.480]  grid beyond its capacity I've always said that every family needs to be ready
[02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:30.600]  for blackouts and if you don't have a backup system in place I've got a great
[02:51:30.600 --> 02:51:34.400]  opportunity for you right now our good friends at solutions from science are
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:39.080]  offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit in fact I
[02:51:39.080 --> 02:51:43.040]  think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make it's literally thousands of
[02:51:43.040 --> 02:51:47.240]  dollars in savings remember these backup systems don't need gas because they're
[02:51:47.240 --> 02:51:51.520]  solar powered that means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise in full
[02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:56.720]  war listeners can get all the details at beat the blackouts.com that's beat
[02:51:56.720 --> 02:52:03.640]  the blackouts.com we've lived in this neighborhood for years we have an
[02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:07.520]  alarm system and all of our doors have dead bolts they kicked in our door and
[02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:11.440]  were in and out of our house in about five minutes the police arrived in about
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:16.440]  20 minutes but they were long gone with our TV jewelry and my guns I kept
[02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:20.680]  thinking what if my family had been home the police officer said that more

[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:30.240]  intruders the officer told me to go to easy armor.com if we wanted something

[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:50.480]  documentaries called access this with an attitude it's all about the history of
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:56.000]  public access in Austin since 1973 and includes folks like you who got started
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.680]  there who gave us an amazing stories about our community and had a voice and
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:06.840]  free speech now tell us briefly what is the time frame and I mean it's gonna
[02:57:06.840 --> 02:57:09.920]  start shutting down what about six eight months if you don't get support and
[02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:14.240]  funds actually we have about a year left and then we we we're under a contract
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:18.960]  with the city that's year by year so this next year from October through
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:26.280]  September we're probably okay after that there's no it's very bleak so what
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:28.560]  have you got a couple thousand members paying their hundred and something
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:32.280]  bucks a year without help that would help tremendously it's to show that we
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:35.600]  are relevant and valuable to our community it would help tremendous well
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:38.720]  it's just such a zombie culture where everybody's running around trying to be
[02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:42.240]  trendy people will come here for South by Southwest to be ripped off the whole
[02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:45.440]  things a giant scam not against it it's just the whole thing is a big joke it's
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:50.120]  like selling dreams they get here bands pay to play to 200 people the record
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:53.480]  companies already have their people here playing it's not what it was 15 years
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:58.280]  ago you pay all this money and then nothing happens meanwhile there's a place
[02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:02.840]  with thousands of viewers every hour just waiting for you just just waiting
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:07.400]  for you to go put your music videos on I mean again it's this zombie culture
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:12.080]  where people just don't know where the real opportunities are you're right
