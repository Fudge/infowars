[00:00.000 --> 00:24.560]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:24.560 --> 00:34.560]  Each Tuesday, September 28, 2021, and world leaders around the planet are announcing
[00:34.560 --> 00:42.520]  that COVID-19 is an official planetary language.
[00:42.520 --> 00:50.760]  Not just the new planetary language, the official new planetary system of control, the unifying
[00:50.760 --> 00:58.440]  factor, they've now openly declared it to be a religion.
[00:58.440 --> 01:08.120]  Everything is hysteria of humans being a poison upon the earth that must be eradicated.
[01:08.120 --> 01:13.840]  And COVID-19 is the Messiah here to teach us that we're dirty and evil and bad and
[01:13.840 --> 01:17.720]  must be exterminated.
[01:17.720 --> 01:23.720]  And now the establishment media, the mouthpieces of the New World Order are in fear because
[01:23.720 --> 01:26.200]  humanity is awakening.
[01:26.200 --> 01:35.240]  And now Russell Brand and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan all sound just like Alex Jones.
[01:35.240 --> 01:41.040]  As soon as you give politicians power, any kind of power that didn't exist previously,
[01:41.040 --> 01:46.840]  if they can figure out a way to force you into carrying something that lets you enter businesses
[01:46.840 --> 01:52.720]  or lets you do this or lets businesses open, historically, they are not going to give that
[01:52.720 --> 01:53.720]  power up.
[01:53.720 --> 01:56.480]  They find new reasons to use it.
[01:56.480 --> 02:00.640]  We have to protect those freedoms at all costs, whether you agree with people's choices
[02:00.640 --> 02:06.680]  or not, because it is the foundation that this country was founded on, freedom.
[02:06.680 --> 02:11.440]  This idea of freedom, there's so many people that think it's frivolous, it's not important,
[02:11.440 --> 02:16.160]  it's not the main thing that we should be focused on, but it is the literal structure
[02:16.160 --> 02:20.040]  that allows this country to be so amazing.
[02:20.040 --> 02:27.640]  Every single country that's ever existed, other than the United States, up until 1776,
[02:27.640 --> 02:33.240]  every fucking country that has ever existed was run by dictators, all of them.
[02:33.240 --> 02:38.000]  This is the first experiment in self-government that actually worked and it created the greatest
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.480]  superpower the world's ever known.
[02:39.480 --> 02:44.600]  It created the greatest cultural machine, the greatest machine of art and creativity
[02:44.600 --> 02:48.400]  and innovation right in here, and how did it do that?
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.200]  It did it through freedom, and as soon as you see something, anything that comes along
[02:53.200 --> 02:59.200]  and inhibits your freedom, you should be very cautious about that, you should be very suspicious,
[02:59.200 --> 03:07.640]  because anything that comes along that can inhibit your freedom is, by definition, anti-American.
[03:07.640 --> 03:13.000]  By definition, it is anti-human.
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.160]  So globalists have gotten the jump on us, they've launched their assault, they've launched
[03:16.160 --> 03:19.800]  their attack, it's in all their documents, the public isn't used to being hit by a tyranny
[03:19.800 --> 03:24.920]  like this, and so they're a little bit shocked, they're a little bit blown away right now.
[03:24.920 --> 03:30.360]  But we're starting to get our bearings about us, people are really starting to understand
[03:30.360 --> 03:34.680]  what we're being hit by, and we're coming together in a massive awakening.
[03:34.680 --> 03:41.520]  So we are all living in an incredibly historic times, and I'm very proud of Joe, I'm not
[03:41.520 --> 03:44.720]  trying to give myself credit to the fact that he's so awake, it's the tyranny that woke
[03:44.720 --> 03:50.120]  him up, or that Russell Brand's so awake now, or Tucker Carlson, I mean I've known all
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.360]  these guys for a long time, I've known Russell Brand for more than 10 years, I've known
[03:54.360 --> 03:58.760]  Tucker Carlson for more than 10 years, I've known Joe Rogan for 22 years, coming up on
[03:58.760 --> 04:03.280]  23 years, and I've known a lot of other people as well behind the scenes, and they thought
[04:03.280 --> 04:07.160]  I was crazy, now they call me up and they apologize and they say, damn you were right,
[04:07.160 --> 04:10.680]  this is amazing, what do we do, and I say, well you know what to do, you understand
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.240]  what you're facing, it's history, Joe's just as smart as I am, probably smarter, so is
[04:14.240 --> 04:19.120]  Tucker Carlson, Russell Brand's incredibly smart, but they're nice guys, so they project
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.520]  that nicest out of the world, well that's not what's going on, that's not what's really
[04:23.520 --> 04:29.320]  happening, so that's an extremely powerful piece that needs to get out, so all of you
[04:29.320 --> 04:32.560]  out there watching us today are listening to us, you should go and share that quick
[04:32.560 --> 04:37.640]  Joe Rogan video that a patriot put together with comments he'd made to back it up, and
[04:37.640 --> 04:40.920]  that's the same thing our listeners do is where they take things I've said and then
[04:40.920 --> 04:47.640]  augment and add to it and riff off of it like jazz, and that's the true human communication
[04:47.640 --> 04:52.320]  that goes back to people putting a graffiti on the side of the Roman walls when they were
[04:52.320 --> 04:57.240]  being censored, and tyranny's been the norm in history, liberty's been the exception,
[04:57.240 --> 05:01.000]  tyranny's making its move again.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.240]  And in addition we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems
[05:05.240 --> 05:09.520]  of these employees, because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical
[05:09.520 --> 05:14.520]  energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.560]  the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe, you have to forcibly
[05:18.560 --> 05:24.440]  inhale and forcibly exhale, that taxes the heart, it taxes the lungs, and we have given
[05:24.440 --> 05:30.240]  people heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered with absolutely
[05:30.240 --> 05:59.880]  no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[06:00.240 --> 06:23.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:23.080 --> 06:36.240]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:36.240 --> 06:44.480]  We are live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, September 28th edition, and we have
[06:44.480 --> 06:49.120]  another incredible show for you today, and a broadcast that is designed to give you the
[06:49.120 --> 06:55.320]  facts, to give you the reality, and to give you a historic current and future blueprint
[06:55.320 --> 07:01.360]  to survive and thrive into this pro-human future.
[07:01.360 --> 07:08.320]  The globalists have decided to shut down a pro-human future and build an extreme dystopia
[07:08.320 --> 07:13.560]  on its ashes because free humanity is something they can't control and something they can't
[07:13.560 --> 07:19.120]  dominate, so they would rather just phase the majority of us out, and the big question
[07:19.120 --> 07:25.640]  is, are you going to go quietly into that poisonous, dark, destructive, enslaved night,
[07:25.640 --> 07:29.840]  and more importantly, are you going to sign your children and future generations over
[07:29.840 --> 07:34.800]  to living under the bondage of this clear evil that has combined its forces together
[07:34.800 --> 07:37.280]  against us?
[07:37.280 --> 07:38.280]  So let's go into the news.
[07:38.280 --> 07:40.520]  I'm going to read you just some of the headlines here.
[07:40.520 --> 07:44.400]  When we come back from break, I'm going to burrow into the fact that Joe Rogan is right,
[07:44.400 --> 07:51.040]  and he's absolutely on target about the classical tyranny we see being foisted and set up against
[07:51.040 --> 07:52.040]  us now.
[07:52.040 --> 07:56.440]  Joe Rogan posts a video comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust.
[07:56.440 --> 08:01.720]  Well, Joe Rogan's comments were taken by someone else and put over historical footage of the
[08:01.720 --> 08:06.600]  Nazis, which it's very comparable to, to have to have an injection to buy or sell and have
[08:06.600 --> 08:07.600]  tracking systems.
[08:07.600 --> 08:14.240]  We're going to back up Joe's historical facts in a moment with Supreme Court cases and more.
[08:14.240 --> 08:18.280]  This does all violate the Nuremberg Code.
[08:18.280 --> 08:24.480]  And here it is, British government trying to bypass parliament to implement vaccine passports.
[08:24.480 --> 08:29.760]  Over 3,000 doctors and scientists signed declaration accusing COVID policy makers of crimes against
[08:29.760 --> 08:30.760]  humanity.
[08:30.760 --> 08:32.640]  That's coming up.
[08:32.640 --> 08:38.160]  They call it a global strategy of global governance to carry out crimes against humanity.
[08:38.160 --> 08:44.120]  Meanwhile, the Pfizer CEO says normal life won't return without regular COVID shots and
[08:44.120 --> 08:49.400]  says you'll have to have vaccines to live.
[08:49.400 --> 08:57.760]  CEO of Moderna says even young will need to take vaccine booster shots indefinitely.
[08:57.760 --> 09:04.080]  On top of a pill you'll be forced to take twice a day by law to even leave your house.
[09:04.080 --> 09:06.360]  It's all being said by the Pfizer CEO.
[09:06.360 --> 09:11.000]  Remember what the Debo script said six years ago?
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.800]  Klaus Schwab said in the future, CEOs will be more powerful than presidents.
[09:15.800 --> 09:18.120]  You will take orders from them.
[09:18.120 --> 09:23.640]  And here is the example using medical tyranny as the foot in the door.
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.040]  And that ties into so much I'm going to be getting into today.
[09:27.040 --> 09:30.200]  The deals with this and where they're going and where they're taking us once they've
[09:30.200 --> 09:32.640]  intimidated over the population to submission.
[09:32.640 --> 09:33.640]  I like this meme.
[09:33.640 --> 09:34.640]  It's totally true.
[09:34.640 --> 09:40.800]  Tom Hanks, I don't respect anyone who doesn't wear a mask.
[09:40.800 --> 09:42.800]  How do we respond?
[09:42.800 --> 09:46.680]  I don't respect anyone who is on Epstein's flight log.
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.600]  And then of course we have this video coming up next segment, the absolute state of our
[09:52.600 --> 09:54.480]  country and the world.
[09:54.480 --> 10:00.600]  The installed New York governor has declared COVID-19 the new religion of the Democratic
[10:00.600 --> 10:01.600]  Party.
[10:01.600 --> 10:06.440]  And I told you over a year ago, this is the new religion, the new language, the entire
[10:06.440 --> 10:13.640]  new world we're entering of hysteria and superstition and scientific ignorance wrapped in a parrot-like
[10:13.640 --> 10:18.680]  repeater saying that this is science, this is science, this is science.
[10:18.680 --> 10:23.600]  She's also declaring an emergency in New York saying the military will now run the hospitals.
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.720]  Yep, just like that, in the martial law, they knew the plan, they had it all set up from
[10:27.720 --> 10:28.720]  the beginning.
[10:28.720 --> 10:34.280]  Meanwhile, they've got billboards up all over the United States and Europe saying stay safe,
[10:34.280 --> 10:37.320]  wrap your face, don't kiss your girlfriend.
[10:37.320 --> 10:42.000]  This is the cult where they don't want us to have children already worldwide in the
[10:42.000 --> 10:43.320]  Western world.
[10:43.320 --> 10:48.240]  We see bursts in the last year and a half down more than 30%, so you see all the different
[10:48.240 --> 10:54.000]  layers of this to depopulate, they're taking place, locking us up like prisoners.
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.640]  And we've got so much more on all of this today, we're going to be hitting.
[10:58.640 --> 11:03.120]  And then we've got this stack, that's just one of the COVID stacks, I've got four COVID
[11:03.120 --> 11:04.120]  stacks.
[11:04.120 --> 11:11.600]  Biden says 97 to 98% of Americans must be vaxed before we get back to normal.
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.240]  I thought it was 70%, just like in Australia it was 70% and the EU was 70%.
[11:15.240 --> 11:21.760]  And as soon as you hit 70% they go, oh, sorry, it's 98%, oh, but funny, where are they?
[11:21.760 --> 11:23.600]  95% plus percent.
[11:23.600 --> 11:31.520]  Despite 95% vaccination rate, Harvard experiences substantial outbreak much higher than the
[11:31.520 --> 11:37.680]  national average, just like Israel and everybody else, or the island of Singapore.
[11:37.680 --> 11:41.640]  It's all the same, it's the shot doing it, but you can't tell the type of people that
[11:41.640 --> 11:46.160]  are under mind control that because they're in a trance state operating in their lower
[11:46.160 --> 11:47.160]  brain.
[11:47.160 --> 11:52.320]  They have articles out saying, switch off your brain, don't think it's easier.
[11:52.320 --> 11:57.480]  Married couples from Michigan who are both fully vaccinated die of COVID one minute apart.
[11:57.480 --> 12:02.280]  Oh, and they praise them for having their shots and all the rest of it.
[12:02.280 --> 12:06.480]  And then hype up out of the hundreds of millions of Americans that haven't taken the shot,
[12:06.480 --> 12:10.640]  they then give examples of them on the news every day going, look, here's another 20 people
[12:10.640 --> 12:16.000]  died who weren't vaccinated yet because they went to the hospital and got put on ventilators,
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.320]  which is the new guillotine.
[12:19.320 --> 12:23.200]  So that's all coming up on the other side.
[12:23.200 --> 12:27.280]  And we're going to play the clip of the governor declaring the new emergency and saying that
[12:27.280 --> 12:31.280]  she is now the religious leader and the Democrats are her disciples and that COVID is their
[12:31.280 --> 12:32.280]  God.
[12:32.280 --> 12:33.280]  I'm not joking.
[12:33.280 --> 12:34.280]  This is real.
[12:34.280 --> 12:38.800]  New York to declare a state of emergency due to nurses quitting, getting fired over COVID
[12:38.800 --> 12:39.800]  mandate.
[12:39.800 --> 12:44.120]  So they're the big heroes, blah, blah, blah, they're in the outbreak.
[12:44.120 --> 12:46.240]  But now they're medical workers.
[12:46.240 --> 12:47.240]  They're smart.
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.280]  They see what the shots are doing to their other coworkers and others that are sick and
[12:51.280 --> 12:52.280]  dying.
[12:52.280 --> 12:53.280]  So they don't want to take it.
[12:53.280 --> 12:54.280]  And so now they're fired.
[12:54.280 --> 12:58.760]  And then when things collapse, it's not the hospital owners fault.
[12:58.760 --> 13:00.440]  It's not the greedy corporations.
[13:00.440 --> 13:04.960]  It's not them following the one size fits all UN directives that have been proven to all
[13:04.960 --> 13:07.200]  be lies and poisonous.
[13:07.200 --> 13:10.920]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's the fault of those evil nurses and doctors.
[13:10.920 --> 13:14.720]  Oh, and 600 Navy SEALs resigning because they won't take the shot because they've already
[13:14.720 --> 13:15.720]  seen what it does to people.
[13:15.720 --> 13:16.720]  And they can do the research.
[13:16.720 --> 13:17.960]  Oh, but all of us in the Navy SEALs.
[13:17.960 --> 13:18.960]  What do they know?
[13:18.960 --> 13:22.760]  All of us are the doctors or the scientists of the Navy SEALs are, oh, and certainly don't
[13:22.760 --> 13:28.440]  criticize Biden for the military, Marine who blasted Afghan withdrawal being held in military
[13:28.440 --> 13:29.440]  lockup.
[13:29.440 --> 13:32.920]  He's not allowed out before trial.
[13:32.920 --> 13:37.680]  Lieutenant Colonel who said this withdrawal has been done terribly by design to destroy
[13:37.680 --> 13:38.680]  confidence in the U.S.
[13:38.680 --> 13:40.600]  I mean, that's what happened.
[13:40.600 --> 13:41.600]  It's a fact.
[13:41.600 --> 13:45.160]  If you don't speak out against treason, well, then you are a traitor.
[13:45.160 --> 13:47.040]  They want everybody to know, hey, we're globalist.
[13:47.040 --> 13:48.040]  We're taking over.
[13:48.040 --> 13:49.040]  You do what we say.
[13:49.040 --> 13:50.040]  You're going to go to the bridge.
[13:50.040 --> 13:51.540]  Because the man's a hero.
[13:51.540 --> 13:52.920]  They don't want him all over the place.
[13:52.920 --> 13:57.080]  First they gagged him, even remain quiet, then they went out and wrestling.
[13:57.080 --> 14:00.000]  So that's all coming up as well today.
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.040]  And then we've got all the lies in the media that court precedents say you can forcibly
[14:04.040 --> 14:05.360]  inoculate whoever you want.
[14:05.360 --> 14:08.960]  Well, yeah, the same Supreme Court ruling say they can also sterilize you and cut your
[14:08.960 --> 14:10.600]  testicles off as you're black.
[14:10.600 --> 14:14.640]  Of course, now they do it by saying be a trans black man, be a woman now.
[14:14.640 --> 14:18.480]  You'll be a celebrity and all the TV ads show black men is super effeminate and they're
[14:18.480 --> 14:23.080]  the rock star because they are, because they're not going to have babies.
[14:23.080 --> 14:24.480]  It's all so transparent.
[14:24.480 --> 14:25.480]  It's all so sick.
[14:25.480 --> 14:27.200]  It's all so incredibly evil.
[14:27.200 --> 14:32.680]  So we're going to lay that out first when we come back.
[14:32.680 --> 14:38.160]  And then we are going to move into the economic news, which is all tied to this and the election
[14:38.160 --> 14:40.480]  fraud news and several big guests.
[14:40.480 --> 14:43.040]  And of course, your phone calls today separately.
[14:43.040 --> 14:50.840]  I am excited to know that listeners are engaged and focused and taking action.
[14:50.840 --> 14:54.800]  And we are getting a lot of copies of COVID land.
[14:54.800 --> 14:58.760]  Mark won the lockdown out that documents how this is a criminal takeover and a fraud.
[14:58.760 --> 15:03.120]  Each order gets a free copy of in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[15:03.120 --> 15:04.120]  That's more important than ever.
[15:04.120 --> 15:08.440]  And when I made it 14 years ago, we're selling a lot of that film that decided to give everybody
[15:08.440 --> 15:13.960]  free one that gets COVID land that is very well produced and has more than 40 experts
[15:13.960 --> 15:16.800]  interviewed in it is simply amazing.
[15:16.800 --> 15:22.240]  And so a major benefactor funded the making of the film paid for it.
[15:22.240 --> 15:25.720]  And then the filmmakers and crew did not get paid.
[15:25.720 --> 15:29.020]  And so they are being paid through the sale of the film.
[15:29.020 --> 15:30.520]  But it is free to air.
[15:30.520 --> 15:33.120]  You can buy DVD and put it on local TV if you want.
[15:33.120 --> 15:35.160]  You can make copies of it as a zero country code.
[15:35.160 --> 15:36.240]  We want you to.
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.120]  And so we're involved in the production, we're the producers of it, but the folks paid to
[15:40.120 --> 15:41.120]  have this put out.
[15:41.120 --> 15:44.840]  So I hope you get it and help pay the crew and then have your hard copy for your library
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.240]  that they cannot censor as easily unless they come and confiscate it, which they might
[15:48.240 --> 15:50.800]  try to do in the future if we don't earn this around.
[15:50.800 --> 15:55.680]  So get your copy of COVID land at covidland.com today or info or store.com and get a free
[15:55.680 --> 15:59.680]  copy order by January 6th to get your free copy of in game.
[15:59.680 --> 16:03.480]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off grid
[16:03.480 --> 16:08.200]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:08.200 --> 16:13.160]  Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:13.160 --> 16:18.160]  These emergency backup systems provide a life saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.760]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce
[16:23.760 --> 16:27.240]  an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:27.240 --> 16:31.200]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues or just getting off the
[16:31.200 --> 16:35.920]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:35.920 --> 16:41.240]  Even better all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off the grid bonuses
[16:41.240 --> 16:42.240]  too.
[16:42.240 --> 16:45.880]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:45.880 --> 16:47.840]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:47.840 --> 16:52.480]  For the free report, crisis cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk and
[16:52.480 --> 16:56.320]  medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.

[16:58.320 --> 17:04.200]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food,
[17:04.200 --> 17:05.200]  I've got great news.
[17:05.200 --> 17:08.040]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:08.040 --> 17:13.360]  Here's the thing, we've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival
[17:13.360 --> 17:14.520]  soup beans.
[17:14.520 --> 17:19.800]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[17:19.800 --> 17:22.600]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:22.600 --> 17:23.760]  The best part?
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.840]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are
[17:28.840 --> 17:34.080]  coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to, gets even better.
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.800]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[17:38.800 --> 17:44.040]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[17:44.040 --> 17:45.040]  world, period.
[17:45.040 --> 17:51.480]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com and discover the real reason we're giving
[17:51.480 --> 18:00.880]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[18:00.880 --> 18:06.400]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[18:06.400 --> 18:12.080]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[18:12.080 --> 18:16.320]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[18:16.320 --> 18:21.400]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[18:21.400 --> 18:26.280]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[18:26.280 --> 18:30.720]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[18:30.720 --> 18:35.600]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[18:35.600 --> 18:38.720]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[18:38.720 --> 18:42.120]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[18:42.120 --> 18:46.760]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[18:46.760 --> 18:47.760]  an end.
[18:47.760 --> 18:53.520]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival
[18:53.520 --> 19:00.360]  gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[19:00.360 --> 19:04.840]  By now you've heard me talk about the bio-pros and how they're creating amazing products.
[19:04.840 --> 19:10.480]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio-remediation products,
[19:10.480 --> 19:13.760]  bringing industrial-level technology to the everyday consumer.
[19:13.760 --> 19:17.880]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[19:17.880 --> 19:23.560]  The bio-pros are excited to release Biodrain Pro, a product specifically designed to establish
[19:23.560 --> 19:27.320]  healthy drains, pipes, and overall plumbing systems.
[19:27.320 --> 19:33.240]  Biodrain Pro digests grease, fats, oils, sludge, paper, and organic matter with ease.
[19:33.240 --> 19:39.680]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs, and is safe for black-gray holding tanks, sewer hoses,
[19:39.680 --> 19:40.680]  and plumbing.
[19:40.680 --> 19:42.520]  It is also human and animal safe.
[19:42.520 --> 19:46.760]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[19:46.760 --> 19:52.160]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas build-up, and odor, guaranteed.
[19:52.160 --> 19:53.160]  Just pour and add water.
[19:53.160 --> 19:54.160]  It's that simple.
[19:54.160 --> 20:03.200]  Visit thebio-pros.com and see for yourself.
[20:03.200 --> 20:33.040]  And you'll be nation-leading with our Band-Aid, which strikes
[20:33.040 --> 21:02.000]  at 6 p.m.
[21:02.000 --> 21:18.740]  My
[21:18.740 --> 21:20.180]  Let's go to rebroadcast for a while.
[21:20.180 --> 21:23.660]  Oh my God, I just, I can't handle this anymore.
[21:23.660 --> 21:24.500]  Mmm.
[21:31.660 --> 21:33.700]  All right, we got a John Bound report for you.
[21:33.700 --> 21:35.400]  I'm gonna restart next segment.
[21:35.400 --> 21:36.240]  Mmm.
[21:39.780 --> 21:40.620]  Mmm.
[21:41.660 --> 21:42.820]  As you have a real anger problem
[21:42.820 --> 21:43.860]  with all the stuff that's going on here,
[21:43.860 --> 21:45.700]  but also get totally focused and ready.
[21:45.700 --> 21:50.700]  And I may have to just leave again.
[21:51.020 --> 21:53.060]  Okay, let's go to rebroadcast.
[21:53.060 --> 21:54.920]  All right, let's pick something for you to air here.
[21:54.920 --> 21:55.760]  Just air whatever you want.
[21:55.760 --> 21:57.300]  Air one of the John Bound reports.
[21:57.300 --> 21:58.140]  They're excellent.
[21:58.140 --> 21:59.220]  They're very informative.
[21:59.220 --> 22:00.060]  It's over.
[22:00.060 --> 22:00.900]  It's over.
[22:00.900 --> 22:02.220]  It's over.
[22:02.220 --> 22:05.660]  Jay Sekulow's European Center for Law and Justice,
[22:05.660 --> 22:09.700]  the ECLJ, recently released a groundbreaking report
[22:09.700 --> 22:12.940]  detailing how left-wing NGOs have infiltrated
[22:12.940 --> 22:16.460]  the office of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner
[22:16.460 --> 22:20.500]  to advance a radical open borders and pro-abortion agenda.
[22:20.500 --> 22:23.640]  The report, which is nothing short of being similar
[22:23.640 --> 22:27.020]  to divulging Hitler's master plan of the East
[22:27.020 --> 22:28.860]  before the invasion of Poland,
[22:28.860 --> 22:31.300]  has of course been completely ignored
[22:31.300 --> 22:33.620]  by all of the Mockingbird media.
[22:33.620 --> 22:36.860]  Do you accept the idea that we have a crisis at the border?
[22:36.860 --> 22:39.580]  I am focused on mission, Chuck,
[22:39.580 --> 22:41.420]  and the challenges that we face
[22:41.420 --> 22:43.740]  and our ability to meet those challenges.
[22:43.740 --> 22:45.720]  Fortunately, the Gateway Pundit
[22:45.720 --> 22:49.380]  discusses in great detail the ECLJ report,
[22:49.380 --> 22:53.780]  uncovering the infiltration by NGOs of the ECHR
[22:53.780 --> 22:56.260]  or the European Court of Human Rights
[22:56.260 --> 23:00.060]  and the OHCHR or the UN Office
[23:00.060 --> 23:02.580]  of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
[23:02.580 --> 23:06.020]  NGOs that include in particular the Ford Foundation,
[23:06.020 --> 23:07.860]  Soros's Open Society,
[23:07.860 --> 23:11.660]  MacArthur Call for Code Foundations founded and chaired
[23:11.660 --> 23:14.300]  by Bill Clinton, as well as Microsoft,
[23:14.300 --> 23:16.020]  Counterpart International,
[23:16.020 --> 23:18.700]  and the Wellspring Philanthropic Fund.
[23:18.700 --> 23:21.860]  The judges who are elected by the Parliamentary Assembly
[23:21.860 --> 23:24.940]  of the Council of Europe are fully independent
[23:24.940 --> 23:28.380]  and do not represent any national interests.
[23:28.380 --> 23:32.260]  Back in 2012, the ECHR busted the door open
[23:32.260 --> 23:36.380]  for radical open borders policy in the European Union
[23:36.380 --> 23:38.660]  with the landmark Hersey, Jemma,
[23:38.660 --> 23:40.700]  and others versus Italy case,
[23:40.700 --> 23:43.860]  which was the first to criminalize border security
[23:43.860 --> 23:47.100]  as so-called pushbacks or refalement
[23:47.100 --> 23:49.500]  and obliged countries like Italy
[23:49.500 --> 23:51.420]  to let in illegal immigrants
[23:51.420 --> 23:56.420]  or pay 15,000 EU in damages to each illegal immigrant.
[23:57.900 --> 23:59.500]  Italians accused the NGO
[23:59.500 --> 24:01.940]  of facilitating illegal immigration.
[24:01.940 --> 24:05.260]  The boat is part of a fleet of migrant rescue vessels
[24:05.260 --> 24:07.860]  active all across the Mediterranean Sea.
[24:07.860 --> 24:10.580]  As for the NGOs, they say they are defending
[24:10.580 --> 24:13.260]  the right to life by saving migrants
[24:13.260 --> 24:16.220]  from exploitation, violence, and death.
[24:16.220 --> 24:18.660]  But their detractors think otherwise,
[24:18.660 --> 24:21.900]  they accuse such groups of actually aiding
[24:21.900 --> 24:24.900]  the lucrative business of human trafficking networks
[24:24.900 --> 24:27.660]  active in Turkey and Northern Africa.
[24:27.660 --> 24:32.660]  The NGOs had infiltrated the OHCHR since 2010
[24:32.660 --> 24:36.980]  as 52 of the 222 special rapporteurs
[24:36.980 --> 24:39.220]  who are required to be impartial,
[24:39.220 --> 24:42.860]  hold or have held positions in open society
[24:42.860 --> 24:47.260]  or an NGO funded by the Ford or open society foundations.
[24:47.260 --> 24:50.620]  See you and other rapporteurs have signed this letter
[24:50.620 --> 24:54.780]  and you use the phrase modern day racial terror lynchings.
[24:54.780 --> 24:57.300]  I mean, what goes through the heads of UN special rapporteurs
[24:57.300 --> 25:01.180]  and your colleagues as human rights experts?
[25:01.180 --> 25:03.060]  What do you think the United States is going to do
[25:03.060 --> 25:06.260]  when it hears that you're calling the United States
[25:06.260 --> 25:08.700]  a place of modern day racial terror lynchings?
[25:08.700 --> 25:10.860]  We are really aware of the opinion
[25:10.860 --> 25:15.660]  that the US authorities have no sense of reality
[25:15.660 --> 25:17.540]  about how bad it really is.
[25:17.540 --> 25:21.820]  We do have structural and systemic racism in the US.
[25:21.820 --> 25:25.460]  This is just a fig leaf for tyranny.
[25:25.460 --> 25:28.180]  Maybe the time has come to replace the human rights act
[25:28.180 --> 25:32.260]  with our own British rights act and perhaps get out
[25:32.260 --> 25:35.700]  of this European court of human rights altogether.
[25:35.700 --> 25:40.180]  His so-called United Nations replacement migration experts
[25:40.180 --> 25:43.820]  continue to receive direct payments from NGOs
[25:43.820 --> 25:45.620]  that increase every year.
[25:45.620 --> 25:47.980]  This is the source of the rhetoric
[25:47.980 --> 25:51.180]  from Homeland Security Secretary, Myorkis.
[25:51.180 --> 25:55.220]  Why didn't you build, forgive me, a wall or a fence
[25:55.220 --> 25:57.780]  to stop them from walking in this flood of people
[25:57.780 --> 25:59.060]  coming across the dam?
[25:59.060 --> 26:01.220]  It looks like a highway that allows them
[26:01.220 --> 26:02.500]  to cross the rail grant.
[26:02.500 --> 26:04.940]  The law provides that individuals
[26:04.940 --> 26:08.220]  can make a claim for humanitarian relief.
[26:08.220 --> 26:10.660]  That is actually one of our proudest traditions.
[26:10.660 --> 26:13.020]  This is the source of the resettling
[26:13.020 --> 26:18.500]  of Afghan refugees in Texas who cost the taxpayer $65,000
[26:18.500 --> 26:21.100]  per individual annually and have been
[26:21.100 --> 26:25.140]  underperforming and draining our welfare system since 1980.
[26:25.140 --> 26:28.180]  You want to know, I assume, just as we want to know,
[26:28.180 --> 26:29.940]  how we can ensure who these people are.
[26:29.940 --> 26:32.300]  And this notion that they've been vetted as we would normally
[26:32.300 --> 26:34.300]  vet, I mean, how can we vet people?
[26:34.300 --> 26:36.060]  Are you going to call the Taliban government
[26:36.060 --> 26:38.700]  and say, is this information about this criminal record
[26:38.700 --> 26:39.180]  accurate?
[26:39.180 --> 26:39.980]  Of course we can.
[26:39.980 --> 26:43.020]  Blue crime sanctuaries like Austin, Texas,
[26:43.020 --> 26:46.180]  where woke Democrat policies continue
[26:46.180 --> 26:49.500]  to ignore the taxpayer's safety, exchanging it
[26:49.500 --> 26:53.300]  for the full-blown invasion of the NGO's New World Order
[26:53.300 --> 26:54.780]  Master Plan.
[26:54.780 --> 26:56.060]  John Bown reporting.
[27:01.060 --> 27:06.740]  All right, that is a very, very important video clip.
[27:06.740 --> 27:08.980]  And it's a Band-Aid video, and I hope people share it.
[27:08.980 --> 27:15.260]  NGOs fuel UN operation against the United States of America.
[27:22.340 --> 27:23.700]  But I'll be honest with listeners.
[27:23.700 --> 27:26.060]  I don't think I can probably, in the future,
[27:26.060 --> 27:27.460]  do this show anymore.
[27:27.460 --> 27:28.900]  And this isn't being dramatic.
[27:28.900 --> 27:30.220]  I can't keep doing this show anymore.
[27:30.220 --> 27:32.220]  I'm going to have to probably quit.
[27:32.220 --> 27:34.780]  It's not that I can't handle the globalists or anything else.
[27:34.780 --> 27:38.820]  I just can't handle knowing all this and nobody cares.
[27:38.820 --> 27:41.500]  And then just watching everybody slowly die
[27:41.500 --> 27:46.260]  and just everything falling apart, it's just that's why
[27:46.260 --> 27:47.420]  I shouldn't do the show, because I'm just
[27:47.420 --> 27:51.060]  going to say depressing things here on air.
[27:51.060 --> 27:52.260]  We have to let them kill us.
[27:52.260 --> 27:53.620]  We have to let them kill our children, too,
[27:53.620 --> 27:56.220]  because that's the liberal thing to do.
[27:56.220 --> 27:58.900]  And Fauci knows best, and so does Klaus Schwab.
[27:58.900 --> 28:00.860]  I mean, obviously, we deserve to die.
[28:00.860 --> 28:01.740]  Public doesn't care.
[28:01.740 --> 28:04.060]  People are letting them kill us.
[28:04.060 --> 28:07.660]  And they declare their new religion.
[28:07.660 --> 28:10.100]  And the religion is us hating ourselves and us all dying.
[28:10.100 --> 28:12.820]  And men won't stand up in this country
[28:12.820 --> 28:14.700]  and won't lead us out of this.
[28:14.700 --> 28:17.180]  And the whole world's falling apart.
[28:17.180 --> 28:21.900]  And so it's almost like sick to sit here on air
[28:21.900 --> 28:23.780]  and even try to fight this or stave it off.
[28:23.780 --> 28:26.020]  We should just turn it over to the devil
[28:26.020 --> 28:27.940]  to run it down to the ground and destroy everything
[28:27.940 --> 28:28.980]  and kill everybody.
[28:28.980 --> 28:29.860]  That's what everybody wants.
[28:29.860 --> 28:31.460]  Everybody wants to be slaves.
[28:31.460 --> 28:34.020]  They want your resources cut off, and you want to die.
[28:34.020 --> 28:36.660]  I know our audience doesn't, but you're the bad people.
[28:36.660 --> 28:38.420]  I'm the bad person.
[28:38.420 --> 28:39.100]  Seriously.
[28:39.100 --> 28:41.300]  I mean, Bill Gates at least has the will.
[28:41.300 --> 28:43.460]  It's up in the morning to organize things, to take over
[28:43.460 --> 28:47.060]  and kill people, because he deserves to be alive and we don't.
[28:47.060 --> 28:48.500]  And in a way, he does.
[28:48.500 --> 28:49.260]  He's killing us.
[28:49.260 --> 28:50.300]  We're letting him do it.
[28:50.300 --> 28:53.220]  Bill Gates is better than us.
[28:53.220 --> 28:55.140]  All the leftists that take money from him pretending
[28:55.140 --> 28:56.700]  like they're part of his power structure,
[28:56.700 --> 28:59.820]  the sooner this all goes down, the sooner they'll be dead too.
[28:59.820 --> 29:00.580]  Hey, everybody.
[29:00.580 --> 29:03.780]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[29:03.780 --> 29:04.580]  Me too.
[29:04.580 --> 29:06.380]  But listen, after all the research,
[29:06.380 --> 29:08.900]  all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:08.900 --> 29:11.660]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:11.660 --> 29:13.940]  It's that immune system health can literally
[29:13.940 --> 29:16.100]  be the difference between life and death.
[29:16.100 --> 29:17.940]  You probably already believe that.
[29:17.940 --> 29:18.980]  I certainly do.
[29:18.980 --> 29:19.940]  So here's the thing.
[29:19.940 --> 29:21.500]  I wanted to get past the craziness
[29:21.500 --> 29:24.540]  and find out which plant-based substances actually
[29:24.540 --> 29:28.820]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:28.820 --> 29:30.380]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver,
[29:30.380 --> 29:32.140]  but you can check out what I've discovered
[29:32.140 --> 29:34.260]  at StrongerDefense.com.
[29:34.260 --> 29:35.580]  No cures or treatments there.

[29:39.420 --> 29:41.980]  and a breakthrough immune support product based
[29:41.980 --> 29:44.820]  on that research called Immune10x.

[30:01.980 --> 30:07.260]  Come to command here with an important message to humanity.
[30:07.260 --> 30:12.540]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection
[30:12.540 --> 30:14.740]  so that you will be safe.
[30:14.740 --> 30:18.220]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[30:18.220 --> 30:24.420]  And so I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15
[30:24.420 --> 30:27.460]  days to flatten the calves.
[30:27.460 --> 30:30.660]  I also need you to wear a mask, and I also
[30:30.660 --> 30:35.380]  need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[30:35.380 --> 30:38.740]  That way we can consolidate control
[30:38.740 --> 30:43.100]  and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only
[30:43.100 --> 30:45.820]  I own profitable.
[30:45.820 --> 30:48.460]  You will then be my slaves.
[30:48.460 --> 30:52.380]  Oh, and then you get that special shot of freedom
[30:52.380 --> 30:55.740]  from Cobra who will remove your immune system
[30:55.740 --> 30:57.820]  so you'll be depended on me for the rest
[30:57.820 --> 31:00.660]  of your miserable lives.
[31:00.660 --> 31:04.460]  Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank
[31:04.460 --> 31:05.780]  with your face covered?
[31:05.780 --> 31:08.140]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store?
[31:08.140 --> 31:09.780]  Do you think they would let you in?
[31:09.780 --> 31:11.860]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles
[31:11.860 --> 31:14.420]  to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[31:14.420 --> 31:18.540]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station
[31:18.540 --> 31:21.340]  and going inside the little mini-mart to pay for your gas
[31:21.340 --> 31:22.700]  with a bandana on?
[31:22.700 --> 31:24.340]  How far do you think that would get you?
[31:24.340 --> 31:27.020]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school
[31:27.020 --> 31:30.580]  with a shield that looks like a space alien?
[31:30.580 --> 31:35.780]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes
[31:35.780 --> 31:37.740]  with normal human interaction.
[31:37.740 --> 31:39.700]  The globalists are running a psychological war
[31:39.700 --> 31:41.300]  for operational humanity.
[31:41.300 --> 31:44.900]  Only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us.
[31:44.900 --> 31:47.260]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[31:47.260 --> 31:49.380]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud,
[31:49.380 --> 31:52.260]  and that it's dangerous, and that it causes major medical issues,
[31:52.260 --> 31:53.220]  and it's dehumanizing.
[31:53.220 --> 31:54.780]  And the film COVID Land does that.
[31:54.780 --> 31:57.700]  Secure your copy now at covidland.com
[31:57.700 --> 32:00.660]  and get a free copy of the in-game with your purchase.
[32:00.660 --> 32:02.740]  I don't like coming to you and saying
[32:02.740 --> 32:04.460]  this could be our last broadcast.
[32:04.460 --> 32:05.940]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years,
[32:05.940 --> 32:08.180]  and only the last year or so have I said that.
[32:08.180 --> 32:09.860]  But let me tell you, the new world orders
[32:09.860 --> 32:11.460]  breathe them down our neck.
[32:11.460 --> 32:13.580]  The big globalist publications are coming after us,
[32:13.580 --> 32:15.860]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[32:15.860 --> 32:18.700]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air,
[32:18.700 --> 32:20.820]  and please support the local station you're listening to
[32:20.820 --> 32:21.620]  as well.
[32:21.620 --> 32:24.100]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com
[32:24.100 --> 32:28.300]  while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt,
[32:28.300 --> 32:30.940]  get some supplements, because it's that money that
[32:30.940 --> 32:33.780]  helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[32:33.780 --> 32:35.900]  I need your help more than ever now.
[32:35.900 --> 32:37.380]  I want to keep fighting the globalists,
[32:37.380 --> 32:40.060]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[32:40.060 --> 32:43.100]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks
[32:43.100 --> 32:44.900]  about the broadcast however you can,
[32:44.900 --> 32:47.860]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's
[32:47.860 --> 32:50.700]  lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[32:50.700 --> 32:53.100]  Whether it's high-quality coffee, or supplements,
[32:53.100 --> 32:56.100]  or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul,
[32:56.100 --> 32:58.260]  all of it empowers humanity, all of it
[32:58.260 --> 33:00.220]  is pro-human and pro-God.
[33:00.220 --> 33:01.060]  Thank you so much.
[33:01.060 --> 33:06.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:13.580 --> 33:19.380]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:19.380 --> 33:21.500]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:21.500 --> 33:23.580]  Well, so does he.
[33:23.580 --> 33:32.420]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.420 --> 33:34.300]  All right, in my film, In Game, Blueprint
[33:34.300 --> 33:36.580]  for Global Insightment, that's so important.
[33:36.580 --> 33:37.780]  I made 14 years ago.
[33:37.780 --> 33:40.660]  I explained that the establishment,
[33:40.660 --> 33:42.220]  the global social engineers, are going
[33:42.220 --> 33:45.340]  to set up a world government with a world army, world court,
[33:45.340 --> 33:48.740]  world currency, and a world religion.
[33:48.740 --> 33:51.940]  And the world religion will be Earth worship,
[33:51.940 --> 33:55.500]  and they even talk about, in official UN biodiversity
[33:55.500 --> 33:59.980]  plans, reintroducing gladiatorial games where people die,
[33:59.980 --> 34:04.700]  and even human sacrifice, so that we see humans as bad,
[34:04.700 --> 34:07.780]  and that humans should be sacrificed to depopulate
[34:07.780 --> 34:09.620]  and bring balance back to the Earth,
[34:09.620 --> 34:11.740]  because almost every pagan society,
[34:11.740 --> 34:14.300]  from the ancient Mayans and Aztecs,
[34:14.300 --> 34:17.300]  to the ancient Druids in Europe, to what happened in Africa,
[34:17.300 --> 34:21.060]  everywhere else, humans would build up civilizations,
[34:21.060 --> 34:24.260]  build up a larger population, and then the priest class
[34:24.260 --> 34:28.380]  would say, we need to start depopulating.
[34:28.380 --> 34:30.980]  And they had different reasons for doing that,
[34:30.980 --> 34:34.180]  but it's a way to shut down your competition.
[34:34.180 --> 34:36.180]  And so that's how I've known what's
[34:36.180 --> 34:38.380]  coming with the great reset and the fear of a virus.
[34:38.380 --> 34:41.020]  And now, does it matter if mass don't protect you?
[34:41.020 --> 34:42.820]  Does it matter if the so-called vaccine that's
[34:42.820 --> 34:45.220]  a gene therapy injection doesn't help you actually
[34:45.220 --> 34:46.660]  destroy your immune system?
[34:46.660 --> 34:49.420]  It doesn't matter, because it's the religion
[34:49.420 --> 34:52.020]  that humans are bad, humans are dirty,
[34:52.020 --> 34:55.180]  we've got to be patients of the global government,
[34:55.180 --> 34:56.660]  we've got to take whatever they say
[34:56.660 --> 35:01.660]  as a communal act of communion as a sacrament.
[35:02.020 --> 35:04.980]  So of course, they've actuaried all this out.
[35:04.980 --> 35:07.500]  They have a year of lockdown around the world,
[35:07.500 --> 35:10.740]  someplace that's still locked down like Australia.
[35:10.740 --> 35:13.700]  Most medical tests aren't done, most even essential,
[35:13.700 --> 35:16.380]  medical things aren't done, and so you see
[35:16.380 --> 35:19.660]  a massive increase in cancers and heart attacks
[35:19.660 --> 35:22.300]  and illnesses and the big insurance companies
[35:22.300 --> 35:24.420]  make trillions of dollars more
[35:24.420 --> 35:26.140]  because they're not giving you your care now,
[35:26.140 --> 35:27.940]  but you're still paying for your insurance.
[35:27.940 --> 35:29.500]  And now all over the world,
[35:29.500 --> 35:32.340]  they're firing up to half at some areas.
[35:32.340 --> 35:35.460]  On average, it's about 20% of their doctors and nurses
[35:35.460 --> 35:37.020]  are quitting or being fired
[35:37.020 --> 35:39.980]  because they won't take the experimental injections
[35:39.980 --> 35:42.300]  because they've seen as medical experts
[35:42.300 --> 35:44.980]  what it's doing at the one foot view,
[35:44.980 --> 35:48.020]  not the 35,000 foot view, it's not anecdotal for them,
[35:48.020 --> 35:49.940]  it's not just statistics and science for them,
[35:49.940 --> 35:50.900]  they can see it.
[35:52.660 --> 35:54.380]  They've got the science, they've got the anecdotal,
[35:54.380 --> 35:57.060]  but they're witnessing it real live time
[35:57.060 --> 35:58.460]  with the science of reality.
[35:59.820 --> 36:03.300]  And so the system wants to bully everybody
[36:03.300 --> 36:04.980]  until about 90% are injected.
[36:04.980 --> 36:06.900]  Then they're gonna tell the other 90%,
[36:06.900 --> 36:08.140]  you're not allowed to go out
[36:08.140 --> 36:09.220]  and you're not allowed to have a job
[36:09.220 --> 36:10.300]  and the economy collapsed
[36:10.300 --> 36:12.660]  and you're really sick from variants
[36:12.660 --> 36:14.700]  because the uninjected did it.
[36:14.700 --> 36:16.540]  Now I said that 20 months ago,
[36:16.540 --> 36:20.220]  now they're saying it today, we know the formula,
[36:20.220 --> 36:23.180]  the more you submit, the worse it gets.
[36:23.180 --> 36:25.380]  And those that submit don't get perks,
[36:25.380 --> 36:27.380]  they get pecked on and abused more
[36:27.380 --> 36:29.660]  because they're a target of the predators.
[36:29.660 --> 36:34.660]  Well, now we have the governor of New York
[36:35.540 --> 36:38.540]  freshly installed one terrible governor now
[36:38.540 --> 36:41.260]  for one even worse if it was possible.
[36:41.260 --> 36:46.260]  And here's Kathy Hochul saying this is a new religion.
[36:47.020 --> 36:49.740]  This isn't tongue in cheek, this isn't her joking.
[36:49.740 --> 36:52.420]  And she said, I am your religious leader
[36:52.420 --> 36:54.380]  and you are my disciples
[36:55.340 --> 36:57.460]  and I want you to go out now
[36:57.460 --> 36:59.140]  and I want you to make everybody do this.
[36:59.140 --> 37:03.260]  So they've declared jihad, they've declared war.
[37:04.900 --> 37:06.180]  And this is a religion,
[37:06.180 --> 37:08.780]  the religion of depopulate the planet.
[37:08.780 --> 37:09.820]  We're all dirty and bad,
[37:09.820 --> 37:11.740]  we need the state to put something in us
[37:11.740 --> 37:15.500]  to make us sanctified that we pay big pharma for.
[37:15.500 --> 37:17.980]  And just like Klaus Schwab said six years ago,
[37:17.980 --> 37:21.300]  it was in Bloomberg, he said within 10 years
[37:21.300 --> 37:23.540]  all the world leaders will not be presidents
[37:23.540 --> 37:25.620]  and prime ministers, they'll be ceremonial and vestigial.
[37:25.620 --> 37:26.460]  This is a quote.
[37:28.940 --> 37:32.340]  They will essentially be vestigial or ceremonial.
[37:32.340 --> 37:35.660]  And it will be corporate leaders that run the world.
[37:35.660 --> 37:39.100]  And that is the CEO of Pfizer, Gates has pulled back
[37:39.100 --> 37:42.740]  because he was so exposed to his passage in his comments,
[37:42.740 --> 37:44.220]  the population comments,
[37:44.220 --> 37:46.180]  exterminate the black people comments.
[37:46.180 --> 37:51.180]  And so now it's the new world order's puppet
[37:51.300 --> 37:56.300]  that is the front man who is the CEO of Pfizer.
[37:56.340 --> 37:59.500]  So here she is declaring what they've already said.
[37:59.500 --> 38:01.220]  Now, why have I been saying for a couple of years
[38:01.220 --> 38:04.260]  this is a religion before they even launched the COVID fear?
[38:04.260 --> 38:06.340]  Why do you have the Surgeon General of Florida
[38:06.340 --> 38:08.540]  coming out last week and saying vaccines
[38:08.540 --> 38:11.180]  and the fear of this and the hysteria is a religion?
[38:11.180 --> 38:13.860]  Well, of course, Satan's religion is a con.
[38:13.860 --> 38:14.700]  It is fear.
[38:14.700 --> 38:16.260]  And the deeper you get into it,
[38:16.260 --> 38:17.860]  you keep thinking you'll get out
[38:17.860 --> 38:19.760]  if you'll just double down again.
[38:21.340 --> 38:23.900]  Newly appointed Florida Surgeon General
[38:24.940 --> 38:28.660]  says state done with fear, vaccine treated like a religion.
[38:28.660 --> 38:32.220]  Yes, and it's done by behavioral psychologists
[38:32.220 --> 38:34.060]  who have a blueprint, who have a plan.
[38:34.060 --> 38:36.300]  That's why on the same day in Australia
[38:36.300 --> 38:37.740]  and the same day in Spain
[38:37.740 --> 38:39.260]  and the same day in Canada
[38:39.260 --> 38:40.740]  and the same day in the US
[38:40.740 --> 38:44.060]  and the same day globally by the head of Pfizer, they said,
[38:44.060 --> 38:45.900]  this is never gonna end.
[38:45.900 --> 38:48.620]  If you don't take the shot, you won't be able to live.
[38:48.620 --> 38:49.580]  What are they really saying?
[38:49.580 --> 38:51.940]  We're gonna kill you if you don't take the shot.
[38:51.940 --> 38:53.860]  We're gonna declare you non-essential.
[38:55.700 --> 38:58.700]  COVID vaccines are from God to us.
[38:59.980 --> 39:02.740]  New York Governor tells Brooklyn Mega Church,
[39:02.740 --> 39:07.740]  God wants you to take the genome of a dead baby.
[39:07.980 --> 39:09.780]  God wants you to take the genome
[39:09.780 --> 39:11.740]  of a jellyfish colony creature into you.
[39:11.740 --> 39:13.260]  God wants you to take this
[39:13.260 --> 39:16.060]  and make yourselves produce a toxic spike protein
[39:16.060 --> 39:17.740]  and I'll play a doctor next segment
[39:17.740 --> 39:19.740]  on breaking down how it gives you cancer.
[39:20.780 --> 39:21.820]  Now, just six months ago,
[39:21.820 --> 39:23.540]  it was bowing down to Black Lives Matter.
[39:23.540 --> 39:25.700]  Bunch of white people bowing to white people
[39:25.700 --> 39:26.980]  saying we love black people,
[39:26.980 --> 39:28.660]  but really they meant George Soros
[39:28.660 --> 39:29.780]  that funded it and created it.
[39:29.780 --> 39:31.100]  We worship the UN.
[39:31.100 --> 39:32.620]  We worship corporate America.
[39:32.620 --> 39:35.420]  We love black people and all the major,
[39:35.420 --> 39:37.300]  almost all the major spokespersons
[39:37.300 --> 39:40.900]  for everything from insurance to automobiles is black people.
[39:40.900 --> 39:44.420]  Well, the globalist goal is to exterminate
[39:44.420 --> 39:46.460]  everybody, particularly black folks.
[39:46.460 --> 39:48.420]  So they wrap themselves in camouflage.
[39:48.420 --> 39:51.300]  This camouflage isn't desert camouflage.
[39:51.300 --> 39:55.060]  For Iraq, it's not jungle camouflage for Vietnam.
[39:55.060 --> 39:58.380]  It is black camouflage, urban camouflage,
[39:58.380 --> 40:01.740]  seen as cutting edge, seen as outside the box,
[40:01.740 --> 40:04.580]  seen as avant-garde,
[40:04.580 --> 40:08.140]  but really just the camouflage for the new world order.
[40:09.980 --> 40:12.780]  So here is the governor announcing my new religion.
[40:12.780 --> 40:15.540]  I prayed a lot to God during this time.
[40:15.540 --> 40:16.580]  And you know what?
[40:16.580 --> 40:18.460]  God did answer our prayers.
[40:18.460 --> 40:21.060]  He made the smartest men and women,
[40:21.060 --> 40:23.500]  the scientists, the doctors, the researchers.
[40:23.500 --> 40:26.060]  He made them come up with a vaccine.
[40:26.060 --> 40:28.380]  That is from God to us.
[40:28.380 --> 40:31.100]  And we must say thank you, God.
[40:31.100 --> 40:31.940]  Thank you.
[40:31.940 --> 40:34.580]  And I wear my vaccinated necklace all the time
[40:34.580 --> 40:37.740]  to say I'm vaccinated, all of you.
[40:37.740 --> 40:39.380]  Yes, I know you're vaccinated.
[40:39.380 --> 40:40.340]  You're the smart ones.
[40:40.340 --> 40:41.500]  But you know there's people out there
[40:41.500 --> 40:43.740]  who aren't listening to God and what God wants.
[40:43.740 --> 40:45.060]  You know this.
[40:45.060 --> 40:46.500]  You know who they are.
[40:46.500 --> 40:48.540]  I need you to be my apostles.
[40:48.540 --> 40:50.100]  Guys can pause, please.
[40:50.100 --> 40:51.140]  Back to sub 10 seconds.
[40:51.140 --> 40:53.380]  I mean, this woman looks like some kind of demonic,
[40:53.380 --> 40:57.180]  skexie witch.
[40:57.180 --> 40:59.540]  And she's up there after they murdered all these people
[40:59.540 --> 41:01.700]  sending COVID patients to the hospitals on purpose
[41:01.700 --> 41:02.980]  and used ventilators to do it.
[41:02.980 --> 41:06.020]  You got $53,000 for every person they killed.
[41:06.020 --> 41:07.660]  And the big hospitals donated money to them.
[41:07.660 --> 41:09.820]  And here's this monstrous woman.
[41:09.820 --> 41:11.340]  I mean, she looks like a damn demon.
[41:11.340 --> 41:12.180]  Who looks more evil?
[41:12.180 --> 41:14.260]  Her, Ryan Stelter, or Governor Whitman.
[41:15.380 --> 41:18.460]  And she's up there saying we know who they are.
[41:18.460 --> 41:21.820]  Some people you hear aren't getting the message from God.
[41:23.180 --> 41:25.300]  Oh, they're the devils, you see.
[41:25.300 --> 41:29.900]  God gave us Fauci and Bill Gates and Big Pharma
[41:29.900 --> 41:33.940]  and the FDA director that legalized OxyContin for children.
[41:33.940 --> 41:38.940]  And you see, now God, God has come out
[41:40.340 --> 41:44.140]  and given us her, but there's people that are of the devil.
[41:44.140 --> 41:45.260]  We know who they are.
[41:45.260 --> 41:50.140]  And she needs the apostles now to go out and rape us
[41:50.140 --> 41:52.100]  with the poison shot that removes our immune system
[41:52.100 --> 41:52.940]  and slowly kills us.
[41:52.940 --> 41:53.980]  Here it is.
[41:53.980 --> 41:55.580]  You're vaccinated, you're the smart ones,
[41:55.580 --> 41:56.740]  but you know there's people out there
[41:56.740 --> 41:58.980]  who aren't listening to God and what God wants.
[41:58.980 --> 42:00.300]  You know this.
[42:00.300 --> 42:01.740]  You know who they are.
[42:01.740 --> 42:04.020]  I need you to be my apostles.
[42:04.020 --> 42:06.500]  I need you to go out and talk about it
[42:06.500 --> 42:08.580]  and say we owe this to each other.
[42:08.580 --> 42:10.340]  We love each other.
[42:10.340 --> 42:13.060]  Jesus taught us to love one another.
[42:13.060 --> 42:15.180]  And how do you show that love,
[42:15.180 --> 42:17.020]  but to care about each other enough to say,
[42:17.020 --> 42:18.980]  please get vaccinated because I love you.
[42:18.980 --> 42:20.220]  I want you to live.
[42:20.220 --> 42:22.380]  I want our kids to be safe when they're in schools.
[42:22.380 --> 42:24.900]  I want you to be safe when you go to a doctor's office
[42:24.900 --> 42:27.460]  or to a hospital and are treated by somebody.
[42:27.460 --> 42:30.660]  You don't want to get the virus from them.
[42:30.660 --> 42:32.100]  You're already sick or you wouldn't be there.
[42:32.100 --> 42:33.340]  Let's stop right here.
[42:33.340 --> 42:35.260]  I'm gonna have to come back and play this whole damn thing
[42:35.260 --> 42:38.100]  next segment and then just analyze it piece by piece.
[42:38.100 --> 42:40.980]  She goes, listen to God, take the shot, be loving.
[42:40.980 --> 42:42.140]  She don't wear a cross.
[42:42.140 --> 42:43.700]  She wears the word vaxxed around her neck,
[42:43.700 --> 42:45.500]  the new religion.
[42:45.500 --> 42:46.940]  And who tells us it's big pharma.
[42:46.940 --> 42:47.780]  It's the globalists.
[42:47.780 --> 42:48.780]  It's the big corporations.
[42:48.780 --> 42:49.740]  It's government.
[42:49.740 --> 42:50.700]  There are God.
[42:50.700 --> 42:51.780]  It's the state.
[42:51.780 --> 42:53.980]  And we get our sacrament like communion
[42:53.980 --> 42:56.020]  from the end of a needle.
[42:56.020 --> 42:57.380]  And now they want our children.
[42:59.900 --> 43:03.300]  On September 9th, 2021,
[43:03.300 --> 43:06.540]  the puppet president, Joe Biden publicly declared war
[43:06.540 --> 43:08.380]  against America.
[43:08.380 --> 43:11.980]  He then announced dictatorial powers unto himself
[43:11.980 --> 43:14.340]  and announced forced inoculations
[43:14.340 --> 43:15.940]  against the American people.
[43:15.940 --> 43:18.460]  He is a puppet of the United Nations
[43:18.460 --> 43:20.900]  and the Rockefeller Combine of corporations
[43:20.900 --> 43:21.940]  that put him in power.
[43:21.940 --> 43:24.140]  And he is making a very serious move
[43:24.140 --> 43:25.940]  against the American people.
[43:25.940 --> 43:27.700]  But the attack he's launched is being launched
[43:27.700 --> 43:30.580]  against every other Western country on the planet
[43:30.580 --> 43:32.100]  by these corporations
[43:32.100 --> 43:33.940]  that have already enslaved the third world.
[43:33.940 --> 43:36.500]  What they're doing is illegal on its face,
[43:36.500 --> 43:38.220]  violates our federal and state laws
[43:38.220 --> 43:41.500]  and the Geneva Convention as well as the Nuremberg Code.
[43:41.500 --> 43:42.740]  It's very, very simple.
[43:42.740 --> 43:45.060]  We have to decide whether we're gonna surrender
[43:45.060 --> 43:47.140]  to this globalist corporate takeover,
[43:47.140 --> 43:48.940]  whether we're gonna stand up with our birthright
[43:48.940 --> 43:51.820]  and say no and then prosecute these criminals
[43:51.820 --> 43:53.340]  for their crimes against humanity
[43:53.340 --> 43:55.740]  so other criminals in the future don't dare try it.
[43:55.740 --> 43:57.060]  The choice is up to us.
[43:59.740 --> 44:02.980]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart,
[44:02.980 --> 44:03.820]  deep in my soul.
[44:03.820 --> 44:06.900]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet,
[44:06.900 --> 44:10.500]  I've had a lot of loss that everybody else has.
[44:10.500 --> 44:15.500]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom
[44:15.500 --> 44:20.500]  that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[44:21.940 --> 44:24.060]  And now, we're just throwing it all away.
[44:25.420 --> 44:28.620]  And I see the general public in a medically induced,
[44:28.620 --> 44:30.460]  scientifically induced, behavioral,
[44:30.460 --> 44:33.940]  psychologically controlled tranche.
[44:33.940 --> 44:37.380]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder
[44:37.380 --> 44:38.860]  and it's so incredibly sad.
[44:38.860 --> 44:43.700]  But this is the process of birth and then growth
[44:43.700 --> 44:48.300]  and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing
[44:48.300 --> 44:51.100]  and then coming back to life again.
[44:51.100 --> 44:53.620]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer
[44:53.620 --> 44:56.820]  and control this process of decadence and collapse
[44:56.820 --> 44:58.860]  to actually end the species as we know it.
[44:59.860 --> 45:04.220]  We're already halfway through September, 2021.
[45:04.220 --> 45:05.140]  It's just incredible.
[45:05.140 --> 45:08.180]  And now the world is waking up that info wars
[45:08.180 --> 45:10.140]  was the tip of the spear and was dead on.
[45:10.140 --> 45:12.540]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep us on air.
[45:12.540 --> 45:14.580]  And I thank you all for your support, your prayers
[45:14.580 --> 45:15.500]  and your word of mouth.

[45:57.700 --> 45:58.660]  Plus these are great products.
[45:58.660 --> 46:00.060]  Please take action.
[46:00.060 --> 46:02.460]  So when I first started taking survival skills,
[46:02.460 --> 46:05.020]  basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[46:05.020 --> 46:07.380]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[46:07.380 --> 46:09.260]  I was barely holding onto a job.
[46:09.260 --> 46:11.780]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[46:11.780 --> 46:14.060]  So the first one I got was the original survival
[46:14.060 --> 46:15.020]  shield, the X1.
[46:15.020 --> 46:16.300]  And it worked pretty good.
[46:16.300 --> 46:18.620]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that too.
[46:18.620 --> 46:20.500]  You had with a deep burden source,
[46:20.500 --> 46:22.380]  and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[46:22.380 --> 46:25.540]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[46:25.540 --> 46:29.020]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[46:29.020 --> 46:30.140]  I could think again.
[46:30.140 --> 46:31.940]  I could connect with people again.
[46:31.940 --> 46:34.740]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[46:34.740 --> 46:37.420]  I got my health back and I religiously take basically
[46:37.420 --> 46:38.380]  all of your supplements.
[46:38.380 --> 46:40.780]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[46:40.780 --> 46:42.620]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[46:42.620 --> 46:44.860]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[46:44.860 --> 46:45.580]  It's amazing.
[46:45.580 --> 46:46.100]  It works.
[46:46.100 --> 46:48.740]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[46:48.740 --> 46:51.180]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[46:51.180 --> 46:53.740]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[46:53.740 --> 46:54.820]  into our own hands.
[46:54.820 --> 46:56.060]  Beautifully said, brother.
[46:56.060 --> 46:58.180]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[46:58.180 --> 47:04.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:04.860 --> 47:30.220]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[47:30.220 --> 47:35.420]  And if you just joined us here on the Alex Jones show,
[47:35.420 --> 47:37.060]  a couple of segments back, I got mad,
[47:37.060 --> 47:39.220]  so mad I couldn't even be on air.
[47:39.220 --> 47:40.180]  That's not an act.
[47:40.180 --> 47:45.780]  I see all this and it's so evil and so horrible.
[47:45.780 --> 47:47.700]  And other people are in a trance.
[47:47.700 --> 47:49.900]  I think it's all normal to have this takeover happening
[47:49.900 --> 47:54.540]  that I'm not going to yell and scream like I used to on air.
[47:54.540 --> 47:57.180]  I'm just going to have to go off air when that happens.
[47:57.180 --> 47:58.820]  But that's a normal response.
[47:58.820 --> 48:01.420]  The fact that we let them keep babies alive
[48:01.420 --> 48:05.900]  after they're born, that's what they call it, 42 weeks.
[48:05.900 --> 48:07.420]  They've passed laws around the country
[48:07.420 --> 48:09.860]  to keep babies alive for weeks after they're born,
[48:09.860 --> 48:11.900]  because they can get more money for their organs.
[48:11.900 --> 48:14.140]  If they can get them born, have them in a hospital bed,
[48:14.140 --> 48:17.340]  in a special wing, and then wait till all the orders are ready,
[48:17.340 --> 48:21.700]  then they gut them, get to the airport, and fly it out.
[48:21.700 --> 48:25.140]  Or people come in for their children
[48:25.140 --> 48:26.700]  to get those body parts.
[48:26.700 --> 48:28.180]  And people aren't being told this.
[48:28.180 --> 48:31.660]  And if you let that happen, if I let that happen,
[48:31.660 --> 48:34.700]  well, then I become an accomplice to it.
[48:34.700 --> 48:36.900]  And I told you about that more than 10 years ago.
[48:36.900 --> 48:37.900]  Now it's mainstream news.
[48:37.900 --> 48:38.780]  Well, it was in documents.
[48:38.780 --> 48:39.900]  It was in lawsuits.
[48:39.900 --> 48:41.180]  It came out then.
[48:41.180 --> 48:42.180]  It was well known then.
[48:42.180 --> 48:45.460]  And I had medical workers on that exposed it then.
[48:48.260 --> 48:52.660]  I mean, I've had medical workers on from Texas, Pennsylvania,
[48:52.660 --> 48:54.900]  New York, and California.
[48:54.900 --> 48:59.140]  So is Rob Dew, another host here.
[48:59.140 --> 49:01.420]  Nurses that named their names that were in the newspaper
[49:01.420 --> 49:04.140]  went public, in some of the cases,
[49:04.140 --> 49:06.780]  because they would say, OK, now to give vaccinations
[49:06.780 --> 49:07.900]  to all the premies.
[49:07.900 --> 49:09.380]  Well, up until about 10 years ago,
[49:09.380 --> 49:12.020]  nobody gave shots to premies, because it could kill them.
[49:12.020 --> 49:15.100]  Make them stop breathing, because they
[49:15.100 --> 49:16.220]  have an autoimmune response.
[49:19.100 --> 49:22.100]  And they would then get mad at the hospital board
[49:22.100 --> 49:26.380]  and say, we want to be able to save them.
[49:26.380 --> 49:31.540]  So some hospitals would say, OK, you
[49:31.540 --> 49:34.620]  could put them on ventilators or defibrillate their hearts
[49:34.620 --> 49:36.260]  if they die from the shot.
[49:36.260 --> 49:38.340]  And so they would get all the equipment ready,
[49:38.340 --> 49:40.540]  give them the shots, and watch in the next few minutes,
[49:40.540 --> 49:42.700]  the next few hours, for them to stop breathing.
[49:42.700 --> 49:43.580]  And they'd save them.
[49:43.580 --> 49:45.340]  They were able to save most of them.
[49:45.340 --> 49:48.260]  I've had three nurses on about that.
[49:48.260 --> 49:50.620]  Those are interviews that YouTube, of course, erased.
[49:50.620 --> 49:53.260]  But they found some and put them back on Band-Aid video.
[49:53.260 --> 49:55.900]  That's just one thing I know about.
[49:55.900 --> 49:59.060]  Do you understand how criminal the medical system is?
[49:59.060 --> 50:00.820]  Do you realize how evil it is at the top
[50:00.820 --> 50:04.060]  with its insurance company and HMOs and corporate owners?
[50:04.060 --> 50:08.340]  They're the worst people on the planet.
[50:08.340 --> 50:12.660]  The FDA had approved fentanyl and OxyCotin.
[50:12.660 --> 50:14.300]  She approved the OxyCotin.
[50:14.300 --> 50:15.740]  She was the regulator over it then.
[50:15.740 --> 50:18.380]  Now she's the head for children.
[50:18.380 --> 50:20.300]  And now she tells you the COVID shot
[50:20.300 --> 50:21.340]  is safe and effective.
[50:21.340 --> 50:22.860]  And you hear it from Biden?
[50:23.940 --> 50:25.620]  And you hear it from the governor in New York?
[50:25.620 --> 50:28.380]  They say, oh, you've got to keep people safe.
[50:28.380 --> 50:31.780]  You've got to take the shot so no one can get COVID.
[50:31.780 --> 50:33.860]  And they say it's totally effective.
[50:33.860 --> 50:36.460]  It's not even 39% effective.
[50:36.460 --> 50:37.860]  It gives you COVID.
[50:37.860 --> 50:40.820]  Even their own numbers say 39.
[50:40.820 --> 50:41.820]  Here's an example.
[50:41.820 --> 50:46.820]  Biden, 97 to 98% of Americans must be vaxed
[50:46.900 --> 50:48.620]  before we get back to normal.
[50:48.620 --> 50:52.020]  That's a video statement he said last night.
[50:52.020 --> 50:53.340]  Oh, really?
[50:53.340 --> 50:54.980]  Here's Harvard.
[50:54.980 --> 50:57.020]  Despite 95% vaccination rates,
[50:57.020 --> 51:00.700]  Harvard experiences substantial outbreak of COVID
[51:00.700 --> 51:02.940]  more than twice the national average.
[51:07.620 --> 51:09.060]  Meanwhile, Joe Rogan is attacked
[51:09.060 --> 51:12.580]  for calling a medical ID to buy or sell
[51:12.580 --> 51:14.380]  similar to Nazi Germany.
[51:14.380 --> 51:16.380]  And the media attacks him saying no one's allowed
[51:16.380 --> 51:19.900]  to make allusions to Nazi Germany.
[51:19.900 --> 51:21.460]  Let's get the ADL after you,
[51:21.460 --> 51:22.620]  except they've got one problem.
[51:22.620 --> 51:25.020]  Even if you believe that outrageous yardstick
[51:25.020 --> 51:27.740]  where you can't compare things to a Holocaust,
[51:27.740 --> 51:29.260]  because there's been lots of killing on this planet,
[51:29.260 --> 51:30.860]  lots of things to compare it to.
[51:30.860 --> 51:32.740]  Look at Mao killed way more than Hitler ever did.
[51:32.740 --> 51:33.660]  Can you talk about that?
[51:33.660 --> 51:34.900]  Can we compare it to that?
[51:34.900 --> 51:37.420]  How about it's worse than that?
[51:37.420 --> 51:38.380]  But Joe didn't do that.
[51:38.380 --> 51:39.620]  Joe talked.
[51:40.620 --> 51:43.900]  And somebody put video of Nazis over it
[51:43.900 --> 51:46.180]  and then now they're trying to get Joe in trouble
[51:46.180 --> 51:47.780]  because he's exposing what they're doing.
[51:47.780 --> 51:48.820]  I'm gonna get to that as well.
[51:48.820 --> 51:51.500]  But this video was so incredible.
[51:51.500 --> 51:53.020]  I'm gonna play it from the start to the end.
[51:53.020 --> 51:54.020]  I'm not gonna stop it.
[51:54.020 --> 51:55.740]  I'm gonna just cover it when we come back.
[51:55.740 --> 51:58.100]  But here's the governor of New York yesterday
[51:58.100 --> 52:01.300]  at a major Bronx mega church,
[52:01.300 --> 52:03.660]  saying God wants you to take this shot.
[52:03.660 --> 52:06.740]  God gave you the scientists, Bill Gates and Pfizer
[52:06.740 --> 52:08.060]  and all the rest of them that have paid
[52:08.060 --> 52:10.380]  tens of millions of dollars for poisonous drugs
[52:10.380 --> 52:11.700]  they knowingly put out.
[52:11.700 --> 52:15.620]  And that they are of the Lord and that listen to God
[52:15.620 --> 52:16.900]  and you need to take these shots.
[52:16.900 --> 52:18.340]  It's the new religion.
[52:18.340 --> 52:19.660]  She doesn't wear a cross around her neck.
[52:19.660 --> 52:21.100]  She wears the word vaxed.
[52:21.980 --> 52:23.300]  This is an official rollout.
[52:23.300 --> 52:24.420]  This is all war games.
[52:26.220 --> 52:27.740]  And that you're not listening to God.
[52:27.740 --> 52:29.540]  We know who the bad people are
[52:29.540 --> 52:30.660]  and we need the Christians.
[52:30.660 --> 52:32.220]  Of course these aren't Christians.
[52:32.220 --> 52:33.060]  I'm not judging.
[52:33.060 --> 52:35.740]  I'm just saying that this message is not Christian.
[52:35.740 --> 52:38.020]  To accept the mark of the beast in New York
[52:38.020 --> 52:40.980]  or you can't buy or sell unless you take this
[52:40.980 --> 52:41.820]  into your body.
[52:41.820 --> 52:44.380]  I mean, this is how revelation unfolds
[52:44.380 --> 52:46.780]  with the takeover and seduction of the churches
[52:46.780 --> 52:47.860]  you're witnessing.
[52:52.140 --> 52:54.180]  Behind every hero is a lot of heart.
[52:54.180 --> 52:55.660]  Oh, you got a lot of heart.
[52:55.660 --> 52:58.260]  Now you're gonna take your monthly shots they've announced
[52:58.260 --> 53:00.060]  and pills you gotta take every day.
[53:00.060 --> 53:01.420]  All from Pfizer.
[53:01.420 --> 53:05.300]  Pfizer is like the priest handing us the wine
[53:05.300 --> 53:08.260]  and the bread and this is the body and this is the blood
[53:08.260 --> 53:10.380]  and they put it in us to make us better,
[53:10.380 --> 53:12.580]  to make us where we can live and do something.
[53:12.580 --> 53:15.100]  I mean, this is an occult religion.
[53:16.340 --> 53:18.220]  A giant satanic exercise
[53:18.220 --> 53:20.420]  and here's one of their priestesses
[53:20.420 --> 53:23.420]  up there just with glowing demonic eyes.
[53:23.420 --> 53:26.220]  I mean, she just looks like a villain out of a movie.
[53:26.220 --> 53:29.020]  You would cast her in a movie for a dystopian future
[53:29.020 --> 53:31.780]  where they say it's the religion to take poison shots
[53:31.780 --> 53:34.780]  that create cancer virus causing prions,
[53:34.780 --> 53:37.140]  spongiform encephalopathy and all the death
[53:37.140 --> 53:39.900]  and it's of the Lord and God says do it
[53:39.900 --> 53:42.460]  but oh, there's some people that aren't good
[53:42.460 --> 53:45.460]  who are influenced by maybe Satan.
[53:46.940 --> 53:49.340]  So now the church lady is a pro-abortion,
[53:49.340 --> 53:53.500]  pro-partial birth abortion, crazed lunatic woman.
[53:54.300 --> 53:56.140]  You've been given behavioral psychology,
[53:56.140 --> 53:58.140]  liberation theology, talking points
[53:58.140 --> 53:59.220]  to say it's a sacrament.
[53:59.220 --> 54:00.380]  Here she is.
[54:00.380 --> 54:03.100]  I prayed a lot to God during this time
[54:03.100 --> 54:04.180]  and you know what?
[54:04.180 --> 54:06.060]  God did answer our prayers.
[54:06.060 --> 54:09.540]  He made the smartest men and women, the scientists,
[54:09.540 --> 54:11.060]  the doctors, the researchers.
[54:11.060 --> 54:13.620]  He made them come up with a vaccine.
[54:13.620 --> 54:18.620]  That is from God to us and we must say thank you, God.
[54:18.660 --> 54:19.580]  Thank you.
[54:19.580 --> 54:22.220]  And I wear my vaccinated necklace all the time
[54:22.220 --> 54:25.380]  to say I'm vaccinated, all of you.
[54:25.380 --> 54:27.980]  Yes, I know you're vaccinated, you're the smart ones
[54:27.980 --> 54:29.140]  but you know there's people out there
[54:29.140 --> 54:31.380]  who aren't listening to God and what God wants.
[54:31.380 --> 54:32.700]  You know this.
[54:32.700 --> 54:34.140]  You know who they are.
[54:34.140 --> 54:36.420]  I need you to be my apostles.
[54:36.420 --> 54:38.900]  I need you to go out and talk about it
[54:38.900 --> 54:40.980]  and say we owe this to each other.
[54:40.980 --> 54:42.780]  We love each other.
[54:42.780 --> 54:45.500]  Jesus taught us to love one another
[54:45.500 --> 54:47.620]  and how do you show that love
[54:47.620 --> 54:49.500]  but to care about each other enough to say
[54:49.500 --> 54:51.420]  please get vaccinated because I love you.
[54:51.420 --> 54:52.660]  I want you to live.
[54:52.660 --> 54:54.820]  I want our kids to be safe when they're in schools.
[54:54.820 --> 54:57.340]  I want you to be safe when you go to a doctor's office
[54:57.340 --> 54:59.940]  or to a hospital and are treated by somebody.
[54:59.940 --> 55:03.140]  You don't want to get the virus from them.
[55:03.140 --> 55:05.460]  You're already sick or you wouldn't be there.
[55:05.460 --> 55:07.780]  We have to solve this, my friends.
[55:07.780 --> 55:09.220]  I need every one of you.
[55:09.220 --> 55:13.020]  I need you to let them know that this is how we can fight
[55:13.020 --> 55:15.580]  this pandemic, come back to normal
[55:15.580 --> 55:17.740]  and then start talking about the real issues
[55:17.740 --> 55:21.140]  that we have to fighting systemic racial injustice
[55:21.140 --> 55:23.580]  which exists today and if there's a dot denier
[55:23.580 --> 55:25.900]  I will take you on any date because I've seen it.
[55:25.900 --> 55:28.500]  I know it exists and we are not gonna have a blind eye
[55:28.500 --> 55:31.460]  to this ever again any longer under my...
[55:31.460 --> 55:33.660]  So they're launching global depopulations
[55:33.660 --> 55:34.660]  through these poison shots.
[55:34.660 --> 55:36.780]  I have endless clips of top scientists.
[55:36.780 --> 55:38.540]  I'll play them next hour, brand new clips
[55:38.540 --> 55:41.780]  saying it goes to your ovaries, it attacks your testicles,
[55:41.780 --> 55:43.740]  everything that's been coming out,
[55:43.740 --> 55:45.940]  everything that we know historically,
[55:45.940 --> 55:47.620]  these people want to do,
[55:47.620 --> 55:49.740]  they're now doing through these injections.
[55:51.300 --> 55:53.540]  And so she says it protects you when it doesn't.
[55:53.540 --> 55:56.300]  She says it's God telling her to do this
[55:56.300 --> 55:59.180]  and she says I'm fighting racial injustice finally
[55:59.180 --> 56:02.180]  when this is a giant depopulation operation
[56:02.180 --> 56:04.940]  and there she is in a predominantly minority church
[56:04.940 --> 56:06.020]  telling them take their shot.
[56:06.020 --> 56:08.060]  Oh, but sorry, most of you did.
[56:08.060 --> 56:10.260]  Now there's a third one, oh, there's a fourth one,
[56:10.260 --> 56:12.580]  oh, there's a pill you gotta take
[56:12.580 --> 56:14.740]  because she said we gotta get out of this,
[56:14.740 --> 56:17.700]  we gotta turn this around, we gotta solve this.
[56:17.700 --> 56:19.220]  We're a year behind Australia.
[56:20.180 --> 56:22.100]  A year ago they were telling them just stay locked down,
[56:22.100 --> 56:25.260]  take your shots, you'll get out of this
[56:25.260 --> 56:27.820]  and now they're like sorry, it's never gonna end.
[56:27.820 --> 56:30.500]  Shots every two months, pills you gotta take.
[56:30.500 --> 56:31.660]  If you try to leave your house,
[56:31.660 --> 56:34.300]  30 cops come and jump on top of you.
[56:34.300 --> 56:35.540]  This is the dystopia.
[56:35.540 --> 56:37.380]  People were voting them out in Australia,
[56:37.380 --> 56:39.540]  were voting them out here and so the globalist said
[56:39.540 --> 56:41.460]  let's just bring in Operation Lockstep
[56:41.460 --> 56:43.420]  which is an authoritarian corporate plan
[56:43.420 --> 56:45.820]  to establish world medical dictatorship
[56:45.820 --> 56:48.380]  with a world ID and it's here
[56:48.380 --> 56:49.380]  and they're making their move
[56:49.380 --> 56:52.860]  and if we don't resist it, we will be totally enslaved.
[56:53.940 --> 56:57.780]  This is their satanic, anti-human, post-human religion
[56:57.780 --> 57:00.140]  and any church promoting it you know
[57:00.140 --> 57:01.460]  has got a devil in the pulpit.
[57:01.460 --> 57:03.660]  I'm gonna go to break, let's fight back
[57:03.660 --> 57:05.620]  with the new film, Vaxt.
[57:05.620 --> 57:07.700]  You get a free copy of in-game at
[57:09.740 --> 57:14.740]  covidland.com, covidland.com to get covidland the lockdown
[57:15.860 --> 57:19.300]  and expose their attempt to basically enslave us
[57:19.300 --> 57:20.140]  and take control of us.
[57:20.140 --> 57:21.920]  The new film, covidland the lockdown
[57:21.920 --> 57:23.380]  with a free copy of in-game
[57:23.380 --> 57:25.660]  available at infowarstore.com.
[57:25.660 --> 57:29.700]  You gotta get the order in by the 6th of October
[57:29.700 --> 57:31.300]  to get the free copy of in-game
[57:31.300 --> 57:32.980]  and then we want you to take that copy
[57:32.980 --> 57:34.620]  and make copies of both films
[57:34.620 --> 57:36.220]  and share them, you'll, I don't want a DVD,
[57:36.220 --> 57:38.580]  that's old tech, no, it's actually HD.
[57:38.580 --> 57:41.260]  Burn it, save it on your hard drive, make copies, share it.
[57:41.260 --> 57:43.060]  Whatever you do, war in the world,
[57:43.060 --> 57:45.380]  you are the Paul Revere's.
[57:45.380 --> 57:48.100]  Or you can roll over and worship Satan, we'll be right back.
[57:49.300 --> 57:51.900]  Well, you wanna have a double-blind,
[57:51.900 --> 57:54.900]  randomized placebo testing without what that means.
[57:54.900 --> 57:57.940]  You give 20,000 people the vaccine
[57:57.940 --> 58:00.380]  when it comes to phase two, phase three trials
[58:01.420 --> 58:04.100]  and you give 20,000 people a placebo
[58:04.100 --> 58:06.340]  and then you really look at health outcomes
[58:06.340 --> 58:08.740]  for a long period of time, not four weeks.
[58:09.700 --> 58:11.340]  There's a lot of these injuries,
[58:11.340 --> 58:14.140]  the autoimmune injuries, you're not gonna see in four weeks,
[58:14.140 --> 58:16.780]  the cancer, you're not gonna see in four weeks
[58:16.780 --> 58:18.940]  and many of the neurological injuries,
[58:18.940 --> 58:20.460]  you won't see for four weeks.
[58:20.460 --> 58:23.900]  If the experience with other vaccines is instructive,
[58:24.900 --> 58:26.260]  you look at the other vaccines
[58:26.260 --> 58:28.780]  that are currently in the schedule
[58:28.780 --> 58:31.740]  and there's about 400 injuries,
[58:31.740 --> 58:34.020]  illnesses, chronic illnesses that are listed.
[58:34.020 --> 58:37.260]  Robert Kennedy Jr. is just one of more than 40
[58:37.260 --> 58:40.220]  powerful voices in the film, COVID Land,
[58:40.220 --> 58:43.180]  exclusively available at covidland.com.
[58:43.180 --> 58:45.180]  And when you order it now, you get a free copy
[58:45.180 --> 58:47.420]  of in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[58:51.540 --> 58:55.140]  Cover a commander here with an important message
[58:55.140 --> 58:56.820]  to humanity.
[58:56.820 --> 58:59.380]  I have decided that all of you
[58:59.380 --> 59:04.340]  will take a special injection so that you will be safe,
[59:04.340 --> 59:07.820]  but the injection is not ready yet.
[59:07.820 --> 59:12.700]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors
[59:12.700 --> 59:17.220]  for the next 15 days to flatten the calves.
[59:17.220 --> 59:19.700]  I also need you to wear a mask
[59:19.700 --> 59:24.700]  and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[59:25.140 --> 59:28.500]  That way we can consolidate control
[59:28.500 --> 59:31.180]  and bankrupt the world economy,
[59:31.180 --> 59:35.620]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[59:35.620 --> 59:38.260]  You will then be my slaves.
[59:38.260 --> 59:42.180]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of freedom
[59:42.180 --> 59:45.580]  from Cobra who will remove your immune system
[59:45.580 --> 59:47.060]  so you'll be dependent on me
[59:47.060 --> 59:49.500]  for the rest of your miserable lives.
[59:49.500 --> 59:55.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:03.420]  When it came to the Hunter Biden scandal
[1:00:03.420 --> 1:00:07.100]  that could have derailed globalist puppet Joe Biden,
[1:00:07.100 --> 1:00:09.300]  the lame stream media was there.
[1:00:09.300 --> 1:00:12.180]  You've said your dad always saw the good in you
[1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:13.980]  through all of this.
[1:00:13.980 --> 1:00:16.460]  Was there ever a time when you thought,
[1:00:16.460 --> 1:00:18.940]  okay, there's no way he's gonna give up on me?
[1:00:18.940 --> 1:00:20.780]  I've done it now.
[1:00:20.780 --> 1:00:21.620]  Never.
[1:00:21.620 --> 1:00:24.260]  The president asked a leader of a foreign country
[1:00:24.260 --> 1:00:26.300]  to investigate his political rival.
[1:00:26.300 --> 1:00:28.060]  So one simple question to start.
[1:00:28.060 --> 1:00:29.100]  Is that appropriate?
[1:00:29.100 --> 1:00:31.340]  You know, I feel like I learned a lot about crack
[1:00:31.340 --> 1:00:32.900]  and I know that sounds weird.
[1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:34.420]  I hope that wasn't the message.
[1:00:34.420 --> 1:00:37.420]  Being that the subject of Donald Trump's ire
[1:00:37.420 --> 1:00:38.860]  is a feather in my cap.
[1:00:38.860 --> 1:00:40.380]  After careful consideration,
[1:00:40.380 --> 1:00:43.420]  a system has been established that allows for Hunter Biden
[1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:46.660]  to work in his profession within reasonable safeguards.
[1:00:46.660 --> 1:00:50.220]  Of course, he has the right to pursue an artistic career.
[1:00:50.220 --> 1:00:52.140]  Just like any child of a president
[1:00:52.140 --> 1:00:54.140]  has the right to pursue a career.
[1:00:54.140 --> 1:00:57.180]  When it came to aiding and abetting a biological weapon
[1:00:57.180 --> 1:00:59.380]  from China funded by our own government,
[1:00:59.380 --> 1:01:01.860]  the mockingbird media was there.
[1:01:01.860 --> 1:01:04.020]  The coronavirus outbreak has led to complaints
[1:01:04.020 --> 1:01:07.300]  about a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment around the world.
[1:01:07.300 --> 1:01:10.180]  But in a very tribal and polarized time,
[1:01:10.180 --> 1:01:14.300]  where the information flow sometimes is stove-piped,
[1:01:14.300 --> 1:01:17.340]  where people are talking to other conspiracies
[1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:18.660]  or ignorant people.
[1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:21.820]  Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?
[1:01:21.820 --> 1:01:24.100]  It's not racist at all, no, not at all.
[1:01:24.100 --> 1:01:25.540]  It comes from China.
[1:01:25.540 --> 1:01:29.020]  When it came to spewing out nonsense regarding vaccinated
[1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:32.020]  people needing to be protected from the unvaccinated,
[1:01:32.020 --> 1:01:35.540]  the drive-by media indoctrination was there.
[1:01:35.540 --> 1:01:39.460]  We are both sitting here now because Anna and Sonny,
[1:01:39.460 --> 1:01:41.980]  at the last minute, we realized that they tested positive
[1:01:41.980 --> 1:01:45.260]  for COVID, so they have been taken off the show
[1:01:45.260 --> 1:01:47.980]  because it's not, because the vice president is here now.
[1:01:47.980 --> 1:01:51.420]  A pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:54.860]  What's your message to platforms like Facebook?
[1:01:57.420 --> 1:01:58.780]  They're killing people.
[1:01:58.780 --> 1:02:01.900]  Those who peddle and promote these dangerous lies
[1:02:01.900 --> 1:02:05.260]  are harming the very people who are most at risk.
[1:02:05.260 --> 1:02:07.580]  And here's the latest out of the confirms
[1:02:07.580 --> 1:02:11.580]  that we're still in a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[1:02:11.580 --> 1:02:14.940]  This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[1:02:14.940 --> 1:02:17.180]  And when it comes to all opposition
[1:02:17.180 --> 1:02:19.740]  to the New World Order narrative of the planks
[1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:22.860]  of the Communistic Technocratic Great Reset,
[1:02:22.860 --> 1:02:26.260]  mainstream media implantation was there.
[1:02:26.260 --> 1:02:29.260]  George Soros is this Democratic financier
[1:02:29.260 --> 1:02:31.780]  who has re-emerged in the last couple of years,
[1:02:31.780 --> 1:02:36.780]  pumping in some $40 million into campaigns this decade.
[1:02:36.780 --> 1:02:39.660]  For that, he's drawn a lot of the ire of conservatives.
[1:02:39.660 --> 1:02:41.900]  The Soros-occupied State Department.
[1:02:41.900 --> 1:02:43.900]  The Democrats, George Soros.
[1:02:43.900 --> 1:02:44.940]  George Soros.
[1:02:44.940 --> 1:02:47.420]  He's also a philanthropist and born
[1:02:47.420 --> 1:02:50.300]  in a hungry, naturalized US citizen,
[1:02:50.300 --> 1:02:52.460]  well respected by many in the country.
[1:02:52.460 --> 1:02:56.380]  The theories are as numerous as they are nonsensical.
[1:02:56.380 --> 1:02:57.980]  There's a fine deed posted.
[1:02:57.980 --> 1:03:01.900]  From 5G towers and vaccines spreading coronavirus
[1:03:01.900 --> 1:03:11.420]  to suspicions the virus was unleashed deliberately by Bill Gates.
[1:03:11.420 --> 1:03:15.340]  What that was was a protest against the overwhelming lies
[1:03:15.340 --> 1:03:18.460]  that the media's been pouring.
[1:03:18.460 --> 1:03:20.460]  Well, it won't lie, but you get the picture.
[1:03:20.460 --> 1:03:23.020]  A protest against mainstream media.
[1:03:23.020 --> 1:03:24.140]  Yeah.
[1:03:24.140 --> 1:03:27.580]  Professor Stephen Lewandowski is a cognitive scientist.
[1:03:27.580 --> 1:03:29.740]  He studies the way people think
[1:03:29.740 --> 1:03:33.580]  and why they engage in conspiracy theories.
[1:03:33.580 --> 1:03:36.620]  Conspiracy theories become very attractive
[1:03:36.620 --> 1:03:42.220]  because they're offering psychological comfort, ironically.
[1:03:42.220 --> 1:03:44.460]  If you can assume that there is a handful
[1:03:44.460 --> 1:03:46.300]  of really bad people out there
[1:03:46.300 --> 1:03:48.860]  who are conspiring to do these terrible things...
[1:03:48.860 --> 1:03:49.980]  No, they've told us they are.
[1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.660] ...that provides you with comfort
[1:03:51.660 --> 1:03:54.700]  because, in principle, at least, it would be controllable.
[1:03:54.700 --> 1:03:56.300]  When people are more isolated,
[1:03:56.300 --> 1:03:58.300]  they've got a bit more time to think,
[1:03:58.300 --> 1:04:00.220]  they've got a bit more time to worry.
[1:04:00.220 --> 1:04:02.940]  That also builds anxiety...
[1:04:02.940 --> 1:04:03.900]  About who locked them up.
[1:04:03.900 --> 1:04:05.500] ...that leads people more vulnerable
[1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:08.220]  to these dangerous ideas being flattered out there.
[1:04:08.220 --> 1:04:10.620]  Obviously, I don't think Bill Gates is behind all this.
[1:04:10.620 --> 1:04:13.260]  I do not think Bill Gates is behind coronavirus.
[1:04:13.260 --> 1:04:15.820]  You can always count on the treasonous, sycophantic,
[1:04:15.820 --> 1:04:19.180]  self-righteous dults shilling out hours of selfdom,
[1:04:19.180 --> 1:04:20.860]  disguised as journalism,
[1:04:20.860 --> 1:04:23.420]  to assume that everyone who accepts them
[1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:25.900]  into their living room is a complete moron
[1:04:25.900 --> 1:04:27.820]  that can't thank for themselves.
[1:04:27.820 --> 1:04:31.740]  You know, CNN is just something that's...
[1:04:31.740 --> 1:04:33.420]  It's a joke.
[1:04:33.420 --> 1:04:34.780]  It's a joke.
[1:04:34.780 --> 1:04:36.940]  This guy tells more lies,
[1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:40.300]  and Fox gives more news than CNN does in our...
[1:04:40.300 --> 1:04:41.740]  Why? What lie did I tell you?
[1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:43.500]  Two years. It's another good lie.
[1:04:43.500 --> 1:04:45.500]  But the receipts are stacking up,
[1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:47.900]  and just like any force that dares
[1:04:47.900 --> 1:04:50.380]  to arrogantly obscure the truth,
[1:04:50.380 --> 1:04:53.180]  the foundation supporting the propaganda
[1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:54.860]  will eventually crumble.
[1:04:54.860 --> 1:04:56.620]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:04:56.620 --> 1:04:58.620]  All right, stay with us, folks.
[1:05:26.620 --> 1:05:28.220]  A stronger immune system.

[1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:39.340]  We have our incredibly strong turmeric extract concentrate.

[1:05:40.700 --> 1:05:41.900]  We have our great sleep aid.

[1:05:44.780 --> 1:05:46.460]  and the hair and beard formula for men.
[1:05:46.460 --> 1:05:47.420]  It's also great for women.
[1:05:47.420 --> 1:05:48.540]  It's really a multi-vitamin.
[1:05:48.540 --> 1:05:53.100]  Back in stock, all 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:53.100 --> 1:05:54.940]  We can't stay on air without you.
[1:05:54.940 --> 1:05:56.300]  Please continue to support us.
[1:05:56.300 --> 1:05:57.740]  I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[1:05:57.740 --> 1:05:58.780]  Plus, these are great products.
[1:05:58.780 --> 1:05:59.580]  Please take action.
[1:06:22.860 --> 1:06:24.380]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:06:24.380 --> 1:06:26.380]  We're now into hour number two,
[1:06:26.380 --> 1:06:28.300]  and I got a ton of news and important information
[1:06:28.300 --> 1:06:30.140]  we're about to cover that's really earth-shaking.
[1:06:30.860 --> 1:06:32.060]  And then next hour,
[1:06:32.060 --> 1:06:35.820]  you've seen preachers arrested in Australia and Canada
[1:06:35.820 --> 1:06:38.140]  for keeping their churches open during lockdowns.
[1:06:38.780 --> 1:06:41.340]  Well, did you know that it's happening in Red Stick
[1:06:41.340 --> 1:06:43.580]  or Baton Rouge, Louisiana?
[1:06:44.700 --> 1:06:46.780]  We got the pastor joining us next hour.
[1:06:47.340 --> 1:06:47.820]  That's right.
[1:06:47.820 --> 1:06:49.340]  He refused to keep his church clothes.
[1:06:49.340 --> 1:06:51.580]  They've been harassing him ever since,
[1:06:51.580 --> 1:06:53.740]  and he just got out of jail.
[1:06:53.740 --> 1:06:55.500]  Oh, and the Canadian pastor we've had on,
[1:06:55.500 --> 1:06:58.700]  he got arrested as well for, I guess,
[1:06:58.700 --> 1:07:00.060]  daring to come into the United States
[1:07:00.060 --> 1:07:02.620]  and come back to Canada and for other things.
[1:07:03.340 --> 1:07:06.700]  This is true tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:07:06.700 --> 1:07:08.300]  A lot of people say, we'll just go along with it.
[1:07:08.300 --> 1:07:10.140]  Well, no, that's what's going to make it 100 times worse
[1:07:10.140 --> 1:07:13.100]  because this isn't just a tyranny that wants to take over
[1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:14.460]  and run things.
[1:07:14.460 --> 1:07:15.900]  It's a tyranny that already runs things.
[1:07:15.900 --> 1:07:17.420]  It wants to get rid of us.
[1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:18.460]  It wants to play God.
[1:07:18.460 --> 1:07:20.140]  It wants to depopulate us.
[1:07:20.140 --> 1:07:21.740]  And all over the world, they're announcing
[1:07:21.740 --> 1:07:23.740]  the COVID lockdowns are permanent.
[1:07:23.740 --> 1:07:25.580]  The World ID cards are permanent.
[1:07:25.580 --> 1:07:27.180]  New shots every few months.
[1:07:27.180 --> 1:07:29.260]  You've got to take pills every day.
[1:07:29.260 --> 1:07:30.940]  And Pfizer's the boss.
[1:07:30.940 --> 1:07:32.540]  The head of Pfizer said yesterday,
[1:07:34.060 --> 1:07:39.580]  there will be no one allowed to live on earth without vaccines.
[1:07:39.580 --> 1:07:42.140]  He said, you won't be able to live without the vaccines.
[1:07:42.140 --> 1:07:44.140]  What a revolutionary statement.
[1:07:44.140 --> 1:07:46.060]  What an earth-shaking statement.
[1:07:46.060 --> 1:07:49.820]  Well, now, Big Pharma surrogates everywhere,
[1:07:49.820 --> 1:07:51.740]  like the governor of New Yorker saying,
[1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:53.420]  God told her to take the vaccine.
[1:07:54.780 --> 1:07:57.260]  And God said to people that don't take it are bad
[1:07:57.260 --> 1:07:59.980]  because the vaccine protects you and totally works
[1:07:59.980 --> 1:08:01.180]  and makes you safe.
[1:08:01.180 --> 1:08:02.940]  That's why we have to fire all the medical workers
[1:08:02.940 --> 1:08:05.340]  and all the rest of it who are the medical workers
[1:08:05.340 --> 1:08:06.460]  and see what the shots doing.
[1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:10.380]  So let me show you some articles on that front
[1:08:10.380 --> 1:08:12.460]  and I'll plow through all of it here today.
[1:08:13.020 --> 1:08:16.380]  Biden, 97 to 98 percent of Americans
[1:08:16.380 --> 1:08:19.820]  must be vaxed before we, quote, get back to normal.
[1:08:19.820 --> 1:08:24.700]  He said in a statement, the video is up on infowars.com.
[1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:27.580]  I don't want to see him or hear from him, but here's the quote.
[1:08:27.580 --> 1:08:29.100]  How many Americans need to be vaccinated
[1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:30.060]  for us to get back to normal?
[1:08:30.060 --> 1:08:31.580]  Of course, he's our doctor now.
[1:08:31.580 --> 1:08:33.580]  Biden, 97 to 98.
[1:08:33.580 --> 1:08:36.780]  Think we'll get all the clothes, but I'm not a scientist.
[1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:38.140]  I think the one thing is for certain,
[1:08:38.940 --> 1:08:41.260]  a quarter of the country can't go without vaccinated
[1:08:41.260 --> 1:08:42.940]  and us not continue to have a problem.
[1:08:42.940 --> 1:08:46.300]  Oh, that's why the vaccinated are getting sick.
[1:08:46.300 --> 1:08:48.140]  That's why they're the majority of those dying.
[1:08:49.260 --> 1:08:51.420]  And here's evidence of that right here.
[1:08:51.420 --> 1:08:53.980]  Despite 95 percent vaccination rates at Harvard,
[1:08:55.100 --> 1:08:57.340]  they're experiencing substantial outbreak of COVID,
[1:08:57.340 --> 1:08:59.500]  just like all the other countries and islands
[1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:01.660]  like Singapore where no one's allowed in around.
[1:09:01.660 --> 1:09:04.540]  They vaccinate basically 95 percent there as well.
[1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:06.380]  They have the worst rates in the world next to Israel.
[1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:07.980]  There's also the highest faxed.
[1:09:07.980 --> 1:09:10.700]  Despite having a vaccination rate higher than 95 percent,
[1:09:10.700 --> 1:09:13.020]  Harvard Business School has been forced to move its first
[1:09:13.020 --> 1:09:14.700]  and second year students to remote learning
[1:09:14.700 --> 1:09:17.100]  after substantial outbreak of COVID.
[1:09:17.820 --> 1:09:19.980]  On recent days, we've seen a steady rise
[1:09:19.980 --> 1:09:21.100]  in the breakthrough infections.
[1:09:21.100 --> 1:09:22.940]  Oh, breakthrough.
[1:09:22.940 --> 1:09:24.380]  It's like doors on a submarine.
[1:09:24.940 --> 1:09:25.900]  It's not a submarine.
[1:09:25.900 --> 1:09:26.700]  It doesn't work.
[1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:27.500]  It's not a vaccine.
[1:09:28.140 --> 1:09:30.620]  In recent days, we've seen a steady rise
[1:09:30.620 --> 1:09:33.900]  in breakthrough infections among our student population
[1:09:33.900 --> 1:09:35.660]  despite high vaccination rates
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:38.620]  and frequent testing.
[1:09:38.620 --> 1:09:41.660]  Mark Coutella, head of communications
[1:09:41.660 --> 1:09:43.340]  for Harvard Business School said,
[1:09:43.340 --> 1:09:44.700]  and it goes on from there.
[1:09:45.660 --> 1:09:48.700]  You've got rates there that are way higher
[1:09:48.700 --> 1:09:49.580]  than national average.
[1:09:49.580 --> 1:09:51.660]  Meanwhile, natural immunity, which studies show
[1:09:51.660 --> 1:09:53.820]  is 27 times more protection,
[1:09:53.820 --> 1:09:57.100]  is completely discredited by the mainstream media.
[1:09:57.900 --> 1:10:00.620]  The advice came out and said it doesn't exist.
[1:10:01.740 --> 1:10:05.500]  That's like saying Alex Jones doesn't have a raspy voice.
[1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:07.340]  It's just ball face gaslighting.
[1:10:08.860 --> 1:10:10.940]  And I've got a lot more on that front I want to get to.
[1:10:10.940 --> 1:10:14.620]  But before I do that, let's get to some cold,
[1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:16.700]  hard, incredible breaking news facts.
[1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:18.620]  This is a story on infowars.com.
[1:10:20.060 --> 1:10:21.420]  It needs to go mega viral.
[1:10:21.420 --> 1:10:23.900]  If you want to beat these people, you are the soldiers.
[1:10:23.900 --> 1:10:24.700]  You are the captains.
[1:10:24.700 --> 1:10:25.500]  You are the sergeants.
[1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:26.380]  You're the privates.
[1:10:26.380 --> 1:10:28.780]  You're the generals in that fight.
[1:10:29.660 --> 1:10:31.660]  And you may be good at one thing and not good at another.
[1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:33.180]  Well, you're a general in the thing you're good at.
[1:10:33.180 --> 1:10:34.620]  You're a private in the thing you're bad at.
[1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:35.900]  It doesn't matter.
[1:10:35.900 --> 1:10:37.820]  Start fighting on every front politically,
[1:10:37.820 --> 1:10:39.900]  culturally, spiritually, economically,
[1:10:39.900 --> 1:10:42.060]  and to defend yourself physically if need be.
[1:10:42.060 --> 1:10:45.660]  And you'll build those muscles in every aspect of your life.
[1:10:47.100 --> 1:10:49.420]  Here it is. 4,600 doctors.
[1:10:49.420 --> 1:10:51.100]  It was 3,900 yesterday.
[1:10:52.380 --> 1:10:56.060]  Signed declaration accusing COVID policy makers of crimes
[1:10:56.060 --> 1:10:57.180]  against humanity.
[1:10:57.980 --> 1:10:58.940]  It's powerful.
[1:11:00.460 --> 1:11:02.460]  Meanwhile, new videos come out.
[1:11:02.460 --> 1:11:05.900]  The third in the series from the great folks at Project Veritas.
[1:11:06.620 --> 1:11:08.620]  Johnson and Johnson officials.
[1:11:08.620 --> 1:11:11.260]  Kids shouldn't get an effing COVID vaccine
[1:11:11.260 --> 1:11:12.860]  due to unknown repercussions.
[1:11:12.860 --> 1:11:14.060]  Then they go into side effects.
[1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:16.540]  Even the heads of the FDA.
[1:11:16.540 --> 1:11:17.900]  Scientists quit, but they don't care.
[1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:21.420]  Texas and Florida governors bypass Biden.
[1:11:21.420 --> 1:11:24.060]  Hurts this lifesaving antibody treatment for COVID
[1:11:24.060 --> 1:11:26.140]  because Biden won't give it to southern states.
[1:11:27.580 --> 1:11:29.660]  And once it's all dead, folks, it's total war.
[1:11:30.700 --> 1:11:31.500]  That's all coming up.
[1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:35.100]  But first, let's go to the inventor of mRNA technology
[1:11:35.100 --> 1:11:36.860]  who says it doesn't work and is dangerous.
[1:11:36.860 --> 1:11:44.060]  For, quote, the cold, Dr. Robert Malone reads the global COVID summit declaration.
[1:11:44.060 --> 1:11:46.620]  This is from a couple of days ago when it was 2,000 names.
[1:11:46.620 --> 1:11:49.500]  Now it's 4,000 as of showtime, 4,600.
[1:11:49.500 --> 1:11:51.260]  It's probably 5,000, 10,000 now.
[1:11:51.260 --> 1:11:51.980]  Who knows?
[1:11:51.980 --> 1:11:53.260]  We'll have updates as they develop.
[1:11:54.300 --> 1:11:56.940]  Oh, they say no doctors or scientists are going against this.
[1:11:56.940 --> 1:11:57.740]  Well, that's not the truth.
[1:11:57.740 --> 1:12:01.260]  Here's Dr. Robert Malone reading the global COVID summit declaration.
[1:12:01.260 --> 1:12:09.260]  This declaration of the COVID summit in Rome, Italy, we, the physicians of the world,
[1:12:09.260 --> 1:12:15.180]  united and loyal to the Hippocratic Oath, recognizing the profession of medicine as we
[1:12:15.180 --> 1:12:19.900]  know it, is at a crossroad, are compelled to declare the following.
[1:12:21.180 --> 1:12:27.020]  Whereas it is our utmost responsibility and duty to uphold and restore the dignity,
[1:12:27.020 --> 1:12:29.660]  integrity, art, and science of medicine.
[1:12:29.660 --> 1:12:36.140]  Whereas there is an unprecedented assault on our ability to care for our patients.
[1:12:37.260 --> 1:12:43.660]  Whereas public policy has chosen to ignore fundamental concepts of science, health,
[1:12:43.660 --> 1:12:48.620]  and wellness, instead embracing a one size fits all treatment strategy,
[1:12:49.180 --> 1:12:53.180]  which has led to more illness and death than the individualized,
[1:12:53.180 --> 1:12:55.100]  personalized approach to health care.
[1:12:55.100 --> 1:12:59.500]  Whereas physicians and other health care providers working at the front lines,
[1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:05.740]  including those here, utilizing their knowledge of epidemiology, pathophysiology,
[1:13:05.740 --> 1:13:11.820]  and pharmacology are often first to identify new, potentially life-saving treatments.
[1:13:12.700 --> 1:13:17.980]  Whereas physicians are increasingly being discouraged from engaging in open
[1:13:17.980 --> 1:13:23.260]  professional discourse and the exchange of ideas about new and emerging diseases.
[1:13:23.260 --> 1:13:27.660]  Not only endangering the essence of the medical profession, but more importantly,
[1:13:27.660 --> 1:13:32.780]  more tragically, the lives of our patients, you in the audience that are listening.
[1:13:33.900 --> 1:13:40.060]  Whereas thousands of physicians are being denied the right to provide treatment to their patients
[1:13:40.060 --> 1:13:46.460]  as a result of barriers put up by pharmacies, hospitals, and public health agencies,
[1:13:46.460 --> 1:13:51.660]  rendering the vast majority of health care providers helpless to protect their patients
[1:13:51.660 --> 1:13:54.380]  to protect their patients in the face of disease.
[1:13:55.340 --> 1:13:59.020]  Physicians are now advising their patients to simply go home,
[1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:02.060]  allowing the virus to incubate and the disease develop,
[1:14:02.780 --> 1:14:08.140]  and to return when their disease worsens, resulting in hundreds of thousands of unnecessary
[1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:11.500]  patient deaths due to failure to treat.
[1:14:12.460 --> 1:14:16.860]  Whereas the above is not medicine, it is not care.
[1:14:16.860 --> 1:14:21.580]  We cannot sit idle while patients are forced to go home and sick and in place.
[1:14:22.300 --> 1:14:26.540]  These policies may actually constitute crimes against humanity.
[1:14:28.540 --> 1:14:35.420]  Now, therefore, it is resolved that the physician-patient relationship must be restored.
[1:14:35.420 --> 1:14:41.180]  The very heart of medicine is this relationship, which allows physicians to best understand
[1:14:41.180 --> 1:14:46.060]  their patients and their illness, to formulate treatments that give the best chance of success,
[1:14:46.060 --> 1:14:48.380]  while the patient is an addict.
[1:14:48.380 --> 1:14:49.820]  All right, let's stop right there.
[1:14:49.820 --> 1:14:51.020]  There's a lot more of this.
[1:14:51.020 --> 1:14:53.340]  The conference went on for days, but there's some powerful five,
[1:14:53.340 --> 1:14:59.340]  10, 20-minute boil-down videos of top scientists, Nobel Prize winners for virology,
[1:15:00.060 --> 1:15:01.500]  inventors of mRNA.
[1:15:02.140 --> 1:15:08.060]  I mean, you talk about star-studded top advisor to the EU medical system.
[1:15:08.060 --> 1:15:08.620]  They're all there.
[1:15:10.140 --> 1:15:11.740]  This conference has been going on for a week,
[1:15:11.740 --> 1:15:17.740]  and one of our reporters got invited to it, but we had to pay for the plane ticket and
[1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:18.940]  stuff, so we didn't have the money to do it.
[1:15:18.940 --> 1:15:19.980]  And then that's where M4s is.
[1:15:19.980 --> 1:15:20.700]  I'm not complaining.
[1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:22.700]  I'm just saying that's where we are.
[1:15:22.700 --> 1:15:24.220]  We would like to cover it, but it doesn't matter.
[1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:25.020]  It's gotten out.
[1:15:25.020 --> 1:15:25.980]  We're going to get it out here.
[1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:30.460]  But this really is, by every yardstick, an overthrow of medicine and overthrow of reality.
[1:15:30.460 --> 1:15:33.260]  I mean, they say on the news, natural immunity does not exist.
[1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:35.100]  It's 27 times better.
[1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:36.380]  Israeli study.
[1:15:36.380 --> 1:15:37.020]  Everybody knows that.
[1:15:37.580 --> 1:15:40.780]  I mean, this is like saying, Jones is not wearing an AV blue shirt.
[1:15:40.780 --> 1:15:41.660]  Yes, I am.
[1:15:42.220 --> 1:15:45.420]  I mean, they are gaslighting everybody, going, it's science.
[1:15:45.820 --> 1:15:47.980]  And then now the governor of New York goes, it's a religion.
[1:15:48.220 --> 1:15:50.380]  And those that don't take the shot are of the devil.
[1:15:50.780 --> 1:15:53.020]  They are getting ready for mass persecution.
[1:15:53.020 --> 1:15:54.380]  I'll explain it when we come back.
[1:15:54.380 --> 1:15:57.180]  As God is my witness, they're going to put us in FEMA camps.
[1:16:00.780 --> 1:16:02.220]  Your voice counts.
[1:16:02.780 --> 1:16:07.740]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:16:07.740 --> 1:16:10.780]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:16:10.780 --> 1:16:11.580]  They know you're angry.
[1:16:12.060 --> 1:16:17.020]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:28.300]  If you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together,
[1:18:28.300 --> 1:18:32.540]  and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[1:18:32.540 --> 1:18:35.660]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[1:18:36.460 --> 1:18:38.860]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:18:39.420 --> 1:18:44.700]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:18:44.700 --> 1:18:46.940]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:18:46.940 --> 1:18:51.260]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done,
[1:18:51.260 --> 1:18:55.420]  and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you,
[1:18:55.420 --> 1:18:58.380]  and hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for us.
[1:18:58.380 --> 1:19:25.260]  God bless.
[1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:29.500]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening,
[1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:31.980]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:33.580]  But there is only two things to do.
[1:19:34.540 --> 1:19:37.660]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:41.020]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[1:19:41.020 --> 1:19:43.740]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[1:19:43.740 --> 1:19:46.380]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[1:19:46.380 --> 1:19:50.700]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[1:19:50.700 --> 1:19:55.500]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[1:19:55.500 --> 1:19:59.100]  and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[1:19:59.100 --> 1:20:17.500]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:29.100 --> 1:20:31.500]  The corruption of your soul.
[1:20:59.500 --> 1:21:08.460]  That's Stephen Marley on Marley's Son, telling like it is.
[1:21:10.940 --> 1:21:11.740]  Mind control.
[1:21:13.260 --> 1:21:14.300]  Corruption of your soul.
[1:21:17.260 --> 1:21:18.300]  Corruption of your soul.
[1:21:22.060 --> 1:21:25.980]  And now you see the mind control, which if they're saying it's the religion of God
[1:21:25.980 --> 1:21:29.260]  to take these shots, and you need to go out and stop people that don't listen to God
[1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:31.580]  and take their shots, this is mind control.
[1:21:32.220 --> 1:21:34.460]  But let's keep showing you facts and science here.
[1:21:35.580 --> 1:21:41.740]  4,600 cream of the crop scientists, virologists, epidemiologists,
[1:21:42.940 --> 1:21:45.660]  endocrinologists, pathologists.
[1:21:46.220 --> 1:21:53.020]  I mean, the national board of pathologists in Germany went public six months ago
[1:21:53.020 --> 1:21:56.620]  and said we're seeing massive cancers, massive heart attacks,
[1:21:56.620 --> 1:21:58.940]  massive blood clots from the vaccines.
[1:21:59.660 --> 1:22:00.700]  That's pathologists.
[1:22:00.700 --> 1:22:01.580]  That's coroners.
[1:22:03.900 --> 1:22:07.740]  You had the big national board and the Tokyo board of scientists come out and say
[1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:10.940]  ivermectin when given early has a 99% success rate.
[1:22:11.820 --> 1:22:15.980]  The media says, oh, people are filling the hospitals from horse paste.
[1:22:15.980 --> 1:22:16.620]  Fake story.
[1:22:17.260 --> 1:22:21.180]  AP ran a fake story because they are owned by the globalists
[1:22:21.180 --> 1:22:23.180]  and they are waging war on us.
[1:22:25.660 --> 1:22:27.100]  Most of the news is true and accurate.
[1:22:27.100 --> 1:22:31.100]  But when it's the big story, they're hammering you with and pushing that, oh,
[1:22:31.100 --> 1:22:35.500]  there's thousands dead and dying from the horse paste and this hospitals are full in Oklahoma.
[1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:37.020]  They didn't show you a video.
[1:22:37.020 --> 1:22:38.860]  They didn't say which hospitals.
[1:22:38.860 --> 1:22:42.060]  Well, we went and checked and nobody was there.
[1:22:42.060 --> 1:22:47.580]  They were understaffed because they were overstaffed because there was nobody there.
[1:22:47.580 --> 1:22:52.060]  The hospitals were basically empty, so they cut their staff back and said, no,
[1:22:52.060 --> 1:22:53.500]  we're not even in full capacity.
[1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:56.300]  There's no ambulances lying there.
[1:22:56.300 --> 1:22:57.900]  There's nobody waiting for health care here.
[1:22:59.020 --> 1:22:59.900]  It was all fake.
[1:23:01.660 --> 1:23:02.860]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[1:23:02.860 --> 1:23:09.180]  So they sit there and they lie to us and they tell us that no scientists think this is dangerous.
[1:23:09.180 --> 1:23:10.940]  You go, okay, what about this scientist?
[1:23:10.940 --> 1:23:12.700]  Oh, well, that's just one scientist.
[1:23:12.700 --> 1:23:13.660]  What about this scientist?
[1:23:13.660 --> 1:23:14.860]  Well, that's just one more.
[1:23:14.860 --> 1:23:20.140]  And then 4,600 plus sign of declaration, this is crimes against humanity and that they're
[1:23:20.140 --> 1:23:22.380]  suppressing people's medical care and killing them.
[1:23:24.780 --> 1:23:28.860]  And then it's got to stop and that the UN and Big Pharma is running it and that the vaccines
[1:23:28.860 --> 1:23:30.460]  aren't vaccines that are hurting people.
[1:23:31.180 --> 1:23:34.780]  That response is, well, just censor that off the Internet so nobody can hear it.
[1:23:35.580 --> 1:23:39.500]  This is all the big tech and all the big media and all the big pharma owned by the big corrupt
[1:23:39.500 --> 1:23:43.740]  families in the banks, waging war on the banks, and the big pharma on the banks.
[1:23:43.740 --> 1:23:47.660]  Waging war on humanity, bullying humanity.
[1:23:49.180 --> 1:23:55.980]  Coming in and just assaulting common sense, assaulting families, assaulting our health,
[1:23:55.980 --> 1:24:00.940]  assaulting our economy, telling us we're not essential, putting us under martial law,
[1:24:00.940 --> 1:24:01.980]  locking us down.
[1:24:02.700 --> 1:24:06.700]  And in the regions that have globalist in control, they've announced you're never coming
[1:24:06.700 --> 1:24:07.340]  out of lockdown.
[1:24:08.380 --> 1:24:10.380]  Wasn't 15 days to flatten the curve.
[1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:14.860]  We told you this is the beginning of the end of civilization as we know it because
[1:24:14.860 --> 1:24:17.340]  Klaus Schwab says this is the great reset.
[1:24:17.340 --> 1:24:21.580]  The post-industrial world forced depopulation of 90%.
[1:24:21.580 --> 1:24:27.580]  His Wikipedia says he wants to capture governments and not have voters have any power.
[1:24:27.580 --> 1:24:32.460]  That's called someone promoting a corporate worldwide dictatorship.
[1:24:34.380 --> 1:24:35.340]  There's no debate.
[1:24:35.340 --> 1:24:36.380]  There's no discussion.
[1:24:36.380 --> 1:24:37.420]  The facts are all there.
[1:24:37.420 --> 1:24:41.260]  But they don't want to debate in the discussion because they can't debate us.
[1:24:41.260 --> 1:24:43.580]  We're ready to debate them because we have all the facts.
[1:24:43.580 --> 1:24:45.820]  And then you realize there is no debate.
[1:24:46.860 --> 1:24:50.300]  That's why they don't want to have a debate is because they can't argue with us.
[1:24:50.300 --> 1:24:55.500]  They can only hope to gaslight us and censor us and scare enough people away from doing
[1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:56.220]  their own research.
[1:24:56.220 --> 1:25:06.940]  Here's a very important clip of Professor Sacharat Bakadai explaining how the vaccine
[1:25:06.940 --> 1:25:08.620]  destroys your immune system.
[1:25:08.620 --> 1:25:12.940]  And then I've got a member of parliament reading from the government's own numbers of
[1:25:12.940 --> 1:25:16.940]  how the vast majority of the sick and dying in Australia have all been vaccinated.
[1:25:16.940 --> 1:25:20.140]  That's their cases of COVID is people that are vaccinated.
[1:25:20.140 --> 1:25:26.620]  78 percent were vaccinated. Another 17 percent had had been partially vaccinated.
[1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:29.580]  So add 17 and 78 together.
[1:25:30.940 --> 1:25:36.060]  What number do you get 90 plus percent of the people in Australia with COVID got it
[1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:37.180]  from the fricking shots.
[1:25:37.900 --> 1:25:40.380]  Again, that's national government hearings.
[1:25:40.380 --> 1:25:41.420]  That's facts.
[1:25:41.420 --> 1:25:43.020]  That's why they don't want us talking about it.
[1:25:44.300 --> 1:25:46.140]  Instead of these be a religion, they say.
[1:25:46.140 --> 1:25:55.580]  So here is the professor laying out what the vaccine does that isn't a vaccine.
[1:25:58.460 --> 1:25:58.620]  All right.
[1:25:58.620 --> 1:26:00.460]  We got a problem with our computer system.
[1:26:00.460 --> 1:26:01.260]  No big deal.
[1:26:02.060 --> 1:26:02.700]  I'm not complaining.
[1:26:02.700 --> 1:26:04.140]  We had a million dollar computer system.
[1:26:04.140 --> 1:26:05.580]  I wouldn't do that on a routine basis.
[1:26:05.580 --> 1:26:09.500]  But we're going to just pause for a little bit of enjoyment time here.
[1:26:09.500 --> 1:26:13.820]  We go to rebroadcast and you guys just talked to me.
[1:26:13.820 --> 1:26:16.140]  Give me a little green light when you got the audio and let me know.
[1:26:16.140 --> 1:26:17.180]  Is it good to go with it now?
[1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:19.100]  Probably not.
[1:26:21.100 --> 1:26:22.140]  Hey, no, no.
[1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:23.260]  Hey, it's not a problem.
[1:26:23.260 --> 1:26:23.980]  I'm used to this.
[1:26:23.980 --> 1:26:24.940]  I love it, actually.
[1:26:25.980 --> 1:26:27.260]  We're going to download it again.
[1:26:27.900 --> 1:26:28.940]  We're going to play it again.
[1:26:28.940 --> 1:26:29.660]  Next segment.
[1:26:30.380 --> 1:26:31.260]  So it's no problem.
[1:26:31.260 --> 1:26:32.860]  I'm a happy person.
[1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:37.660]  We've had a lot of technical problems lately and I'm trying to get better equipment.
[1:26:37.660 --> 1:26:39.180]  In fact, we put in a lot of expensive equipment.
[1:26:39.180 --> 1:26:40.140]  Maybe we need to get rid of it.
[1:26:40.140 --> 1:26:48.140]  But to fix the problems, but I just don't like the mistakes because it changes the subject from
[1:26:48.780 --> 1:26:51.020]  what we've got coming up here for you.
[1:26:52.060 --> 1:26:53.980]  We're going to come back with that scientist.
[1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:55.980]  We're going to come back with that scientist for you.
[1:26:57.180 --> 1:26:59.020]  We're going to play that clip and all the others.
[1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:02.060]  Hey, let me talk about something I can do, something that's solution based.
[1:27:02.060 --> 1:27:05.260]  And that's keep our health up and be healthy and keep this broadcast going.
[1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:07.020]  We're going to play that clip and all the others.
[1:27:07.020 --> 1:27:10.780]  And that's keep our health up and be healthy and keep this broadcast on the air.
[1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:13.180]  Let's talk about some of that.
[1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:20.700]  We have a lot of really important things that are now not back in stock.
[1:27:20.700 --> 1:27:22.380]  They're about to be out of stock.
[1:27:22.380 --> 1:27:26.220]  But despite that, I'm going to sell them at a discount so we can keep the lights on around here.
[1:27:26.220 --> 1:27:27.740]  And this is really a great formula.
[1:27:27.740 --> 1:27:31.340]  It's a green fiber capsules made with organic vegetables.
[1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:33.900]  This is not made from just crappy lettuce or something.
[1:27:33.900 --> 1:27:39.260]  This is made from a whole bunch of known types of fiber that are the highest end.
[1:27:39.260 --> 1:27:45.900]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, a bunch of different organic wheat grass
[1:27:45.900 --> 1:27:52.380]  with the truly important organic cilantro leaf, organic kale, organic flax sprout,
[1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:55.660]  organic, a whole bunch of other really fancy plants.
[1:27:55.660 --> 1:27:58.940]  And I just want everything we sell here is always the highest end,
[1:27:59.900 --> 1:28:00.860]  but at a low price.
[1:28:00.860 --> 1:28:03.500]  So we've got a very limited amount of this.
[1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:06.540]  More is not coming in, I'm told, until maybe December.
[1:28:06.540 --> 1:28:09.420]  But despite that, it's $22.45 for this.
[1:28:09.420 --> 1:28:12.620]  And a comparable, I'm like, this will be $35 at Whole Foods.
[1:28:12.620 --> 1:28:14.540]  And it's got 100% reviews there.
[1:28:14.540 --> 1:28:19.740]  Organic green caps, great way to help yourself be a lot healthier and regular.
[1:28:19.740 --> 1:28:20.860]  It's just an amazing product.
[1:28:20.860 --> 1:28:26.780]  Green fiber caps are 50% off at infowarststore.com.
[1:28:26.780 --> 1:28:31.340]  That's 50% off, because I told them to do 50, and they said, no, we're doing 25.
[1:28:31.340 --> 1:28:33.100]  But you know what, I'm going to fix that mistake, too.
[1:28:33.100 --> 1:28:36.220]  It's going to be 5.0 right now.
[1:28:36.220 --> 1:28:38.700]  It's going to get fixed for you.
[1:28:38.700 --> 1:28:41.420]  And we also got down and out sleep support.
[1:28:41.420 --> 1:28:43.180]  Going to tell you all about that, too.
[1:28:43.180 --> 1:28:57.660]  Call it infowarstore.com.
[1:29:13.580 --> 1:29:32.860]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace
[1:29:32.860 --> 1:29:34.780]  and not spend thousands doing it?
[1:29:34.780 --> 1:29:37.660]  You can with Great Wall of Fire fireplace grates.

[1:30:15.980 --> 1:30:20.700]  On an overseas phone line system that he knew was being watched by not just our government,
[1:30:20.700 --> 1:30:23.580]  but the Five Eyes, the Russians, and the Chinese.
[1:30:23.580 --> 1:30:24.940]  He wanted the world to know that.
[1:30:24.940 --> 1:30:28.940]  He was proud of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state.
[1:30:28.940 --> 1:30:31.740]  This permanent bureaucracy sees America as its enemy.
[1:30:31.740 --> 1:30:33.740]  It sees the American people as its enemy.
[1:30:33.740 --> 1:30:36.460]  It sees prosperity as its enemy.
[1:30:36.460 --> 1:30:40.460]  And it conspired with the Communist Chinese to threaten them, basically, and say,
[1:30:40.460 --> 1:30:45.020]  Trump may nuke you, but if he tries, we'll call and say we're attacking you,
[1:30:45.020 --> 1:30:46.460]  so you can respond first.
[1:30:46.460 --> 1:30:48.140]  That's beyond treason.
[1:30:48.140 --> 1:30:52.380]  But it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their own fetted bubble
[1:30:52.380 --> 1:30:53.980]  that try to get away with this.
[1:30:53.980 --> 1:30:57.340]  Millie and all of his accomplices seem to go to prison now for life.
[1:30:57.340 --> 1:31:06.140]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:31:06.140 --> 1:31:27.020]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked, and threatened because we are effective.
[1:31:28.540 --> 1:31:30.460]  The great awakening is here.
[1:31:30.460 --> 1:31:36.860]  Go to banned.video, download the videos, and share.
[1:31:36.860 --> 1:31:41.020]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[1:31:44.140 --> 1:31:45.900]  and never give up the fight.
[1:31:55.500 --> 1:31:57.740]  Infowars.com
[1:31:57.740 --> 1:32:04.140]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems
[1:32:04.140 --> 1:32:08.460]  of these employees, because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical
[1:32:08.460 --> 1:32:13.420]  energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be, you're really stressing
[1:32:13.420 --> 1:32:16.300]  the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[1:32:16.300 --> 1:32:19.660]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[1:32:19.660 --> 1:32:21.260]  That taxes the heart.
[1:32:21.260 --> 1:32:22.620]  It taxes the lungs.
[1:32:22.620 --> 1:32:27.340]  And we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and
[1:32:27.340 --> 1:32:33.580]  nose covered with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[1:32:57.340 --> 1:33:05.580]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:27.340 --> 1:33:29.580]  you
[1:33:57.340 --> 1:34:05.860]  As soon as you give politicians power, any kind of power that didn't exist previously,
[1:34:05.860 --> 1:34:10.920]  if they can figure out a way to force you into carrying something that lets you enter
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:17.220]  businesses or lets you do this or lets businesses open, historically, they are not going to
[1:34:17.220 --> 1:34:18.220]  give that power up.
[1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:21.300]  They find new reasons to use it.
[1:34:21.300 --> 1:34:25.460]  We have to protect those freedoms at all costs, whether you agree with people's choices
[1:34:25.460 --> 1:34:31.500]  or not, because it is the foundation that this country was founded on, freedom.
[1:34:31.500 --> 1:34:36.300]  This idea of freedom, there's so many people that think it's frivolous, it's not important,
[1:34:36.300 --> 1:34:41.020]  it's not the main thing that we should be focused on, but it is the literal structure
[1:34:41.020 --> 1:34:44.860]  that allows this country to be so amazing.
[1:34:44.860 --> 1:34:52.500]  Every single country that's ever existed other than the United States, up until 1776,
[1:34:52.500 --> 1:34:58.100]  every fucking country that has ever existed was run by the dictators, all of them.
[1:34:58.100 --> 1:35:02.860]  This is the first experiment in self-government that actually worked, and it created the greatest
[1:35:02.860 --> 1:35:04.380]  superpower the world's ever known.
[1:35:04.380 --> 1:35:09.460]  It created the greatest cultural machine, the greatest machine of art and creativity
[1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:13.260]  and innovation right in here, and how did it do that?
[1:35:13.260 --> 1:35:18.100]  It did it through freedom, and as soon as you see something, anything that comes along
[1:35:18.100 --> 1:35:23.420]  that inhibits your freedom, you should be very cautious about that, you should be very
[1:35:23.420 --> 1:35:29.700]  suspicious, because anything that comes along that can inhibit your freedom is, by definition,
[1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:30.700]  anti-American.
[1:35:30.700 --> 1:35:35.420]  All right, our next guest on this emergency Saturday broadcast that everybody's got to
[1:35:35.420 --> 1:35:39.180]  share right now, whether you're watching it, it just streams out, or when it's archived
[1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:44.980]  at freeworldnews.tv, is Dr. Richard Bartlett, and he's one of those first big, prominent
[1:35:44.980 --> 1:35:51.460]  doctors to really put inhalable steroids and other things on the map, and to go on Fox
[1:35:51.460 --> 1:35:56.340]  News and to go on Texas News, and to really go out there and inform others.
[1:35:56.340 --> 1:36:01.140]  He's a very respected doctor, former top medical advisor to Rick Perry for seven years, volunteer
[1:36:01.140 --> 1:36:05.740]  service, merit award, HHS commission, Texas leadership, medical assistance, he's been
[1:36:05.740 --> 1:36:11.980]  on the big state boards, monoclonial antibody infusion center advisor in Texas, and COVID
[1:36:11.980 --> 1:36:17.620]  Texas emergency management, and of course, he's also been a flight surgeon, and a lot
[1:36:17.620 --> 1:36:22.700]  more, and he joins us here, and he said, if I bring it up, he'll talk about it, but it's
[1:36:22.700 --> 1:36:28.500]  private medical stuff, he's helped dozens and dozens, well that's conservative, a lot
[1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:33.460]  of people that I've known, because this delta thing just raged through, I got to enjoy it
[1:36:33.460 --> 1:36:38.860]  like a gorilla on my chest, but I got on what he recommended through doctors, and it was
[1:36:38.860 --> 1:36:43.260]  incredible, within 24 hours, I was 90% better than I had just a nagging cough for a few
[1:36:43.260 --> 1:36:44.260]  weeks.
[1:36:44.260 --> 1:36:47.060]  Almost killed my dad, dad didn't tell me, mom didn't tell me live in Austin, they're
[1:36:47.060 --> 1:36:52.180]  both doing exercise and pretty good health, it's 71, 72, and I thought my dad was dead,
[1:36:52.180 --> 1:36:57.620]  he was like 82 oxygen, within one day of what Dr. Bartlett put me in touch with local doctors
[1:36:57.620 --> 1:37:01.620]  and others that got him on this regimen, my dad, again, when I got there, it was all this
[1:37:01.620 --> 1:37:05.540]  mail piled up, and I'm like, what the hell is this, I heard he was sick, it was all
[1:37:05.540 --> 1:37:10.380]  his chairs he'd ordered from Amazon of all places, and they were deck chairs, pool chairs
[1:37:10.380 --> 1:37:12.500]  he hadn't put together.
[1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:15.980]  The next morning I got over there to make him get up and stuff like Dr. Bartlett told
[1:37:15.980 --> 1:37:22.860]  me to do, and he's up putting chairs together and like pig skinned and like 80%, 90% better,
[1:37:22.860 --> 1:37:28.020]  this was incredible, if he had gone to the hospital he'd be dead, Tim Inlow's really
[1:37:28.020 --> 1:37:32.220]  good friend from the military, he's a nurse, great shape, everything, she's dead now.
[1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:36.180]  We went into the hospital a month ago, said I can't breathe, they said go home, by the
[1:37:36.180 --> 1:37:39.780]  time she came in with 80 oxygen they intubated her to dead two days later, so that's the
[1:37:39.780 --> 1:37:41.660]  story you're going to hear over and over again, so I'm going to try to give him the
[1:37:41.660 --> 1:37:45.340]  floor, he's a gentleman, but I'm going to try to be quiet, for him to not just have
[1:37:45.340 --> 1:37:51.980]  five minutes on Fox News or three minutes on local news, to really cover the waterfront,
[1:37:51.980 --> 1:37:56.900]  and also I'm getting doctors reports into the news that they're now trying to ration
[1:37:56.900 --> 1:38:01.180]  a Regeneron, which I've talked to a bunch of other medical doctors, they say is way
[1:38:01.180 --> 1:38:04.820]  better than the Eli Lilly thing, I guess he's got two antibodies and a bunch of crew in
[1:38:04.820 --> 1:38:10.740]  my office went and got it, but in five hours Joe Rogan called me, he got it within a day,
[1:38:10.740 --> 1:38:15.180]  he felt basically better, so, and then people say what do you own, Regeneron stock, no I
[1:38:15.180 --> 1:38:20.660]  don't, but I should, so whatever's going to, that's a company that doesn't have liability
[1:38:20.660 --> 1:38:24.460]  protection, like the vaccine makers, they say oh you believe in big pharma, well yeah
[1:38:24.460 --> 1:38:28.020]  a lot of the products are great, but when they have liability protection being forced
[1:38:28.020 --> 1:38:31.860]  on me by Bill Gates, they're not, so I'm going to shut up and go to Dr. Richard Bartlett
[1:38:31.860 --> 1:38:37.220]  who is again a hero, a super hard working doctor, a true doctor, and it's doctors countering
[1:38:37.220 --> 1:38:42.380]  this big corporate takeover of medicine, and it's a beautiful thing, so I really appreciate
[1:38:42.380 --> 1:38:48.820]  him coming on, his websites are buttesodyneworks.com, yeah I feel like I couldn't breathe and every
[1:38:48.820 --> 1:38:55.100]  time I would do it, I felt better for a while, but it went away in a few days, synergyhealthdpc.com,
[1:38:55.100 --> 1:39:01.580]  we'll try to put those URLs on screen, synergyhealthdpc.com and budesodyneworks.com, all right doc,
[1:39:01.580 --> 1:39:06.060]  if I don't talk, don't stop, if I talk, I'll talk over, you've said you've been a listener
[1:39:06.060 --> 1:39:09.700]  for a while so you know that, you've got the force of the time we've got on the Saturday
[1:39:09.700 --> 1:39:12.460]  evenings, thanks for spending your time with us, you've been very busy and hard to get
[1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:15.460]  on, I understand, so thank you for joining us.
[1:39:15.460 --> 1:39:21.180]  Alex, I just finished another long day at the Regeneron Monoclonal Antibody Infusion
[1:39:21.180 --> 1:39:29.100]  Center in West Texas, and this is another early outpatient therapy that works against
[1:39:29.100 --> 1:39:34.660]  COVID, this actually works, half of the people that come in, I'd say approximately half,
[1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:39.660]  have been vaccinated, what does that tell you about that, but I'll tell you this helps
[1:39:39.660 --> 1:39:44.220]  whether you've been vaccinated or not, if you have COVID and you have symptoms, we're
[1:39:44.220 --> 1:39:52.260]  seeing people immediately get results, and so the strategy out of this pandemic is early
[1:39:52.260 --> 1:39:59.420]  effective outpatient therapies, treating people early, we've been trying the vaccine, we've
[1:39:59.420 --> 1:40:04.180]  been trying the masks, we've been trying social distancing, those things have been strategies
[1:40:04.180 --> 1:40:09.340]  that came out of China, how's that working, but I'll tell you early effective outpatient
[1:40:09.340 --> 1:40:14.540]  therapies are working, we have a trail of people living, instead of a trail of tears
[1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:20.140]  with the other strategy, frankly, I'm not happy about people dying, and so there are
[1:40:20.140 --> 1:40:27.820]  some things that work, and for instance, this little university called Oxford University,
[1:40:27.820 --> 1:40:35.500]  the oldest university in the English-speaking world, since 1096, with 72 Nobel Prize laureates
[1:40:35.500 --> 1:40:42.740]  proved that BUDESINIDE is an effective early therapy for COVID, that one medicine, and
[1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:49.300]  they used in the STOIC trial, a randomized controlled trial, they were giving just a
[1:40:49.300 --> 1:40:56.940]  whiff of that, a puff twice a day with an inhaler, and they concluded that 90% of hospitalizations,
[1:40:56.940 --> 1:41:03.980]  ER visits and urgent care visits could be prevented with early outpatient BUDESINIDE,
[1:41:03.980 --> 1:41:11.700]  I think that's big news, Oxford's the same place that they came out with using dexamethasone
[1:41:11.700 --> 1:41:21.740]  IV in the hospital for COVID patients in the ICU, and they concluded that 20 to 33% increased
[1:41:21.740 --> 1:41:28.020]  survival with that strategy, how about the same university, Oxford University later showing
[1:41:28.020 --> 1:41:36.660]  a 90% success rate with just an inhaled steroid, which is inexpensive, readily available, generic,
[1:41:36.660 --> 1:41:42.460]  nobody's going to make any money off of this, but it's in every pharmacy on every corner
[1:41:42.460 --> 1:41:47.500]  in the United States, it's in every hospital in the United States, and so that's just one
[1:41:47.500 --> 1:41:54.740]  tool, but then you look at Regeneron monoclonal antibody infusion centers, and that 30-minute
[1:41:54.740 --> 1:42:05.140]  infusion, it will prevent 70% of hospitalizations and death, I'm starting to see a pattern
[1:42:05.140 --> 1:42:11.780]  here that early outpatient therapies are a good idea, and they're the way to go, and
[1:42:11.780 --> 1:42:18.980]  so let's consider 90% with BUDESINIDE, early and expensive, very safe, has been used on
[1:42:18.980 --> 1:42:26.140]  two-pound preemie babies in the NICU for decades now, we know what to expect with it, there's
[1:42:26.140 --> 1:42:31.980]  a wealth of information about it, and then you look at Regeneron using monoclonal antibodies,
[1:42:31.980 --> 1:42:40.620]  a technology that we've had for 40 years now in medicine, that we use in cancer treatment,
[1:42:40.620 --> 1:42:47.700]  that we use in other infectious diseases, and the evidence is 70% decrease in hospitalization
[1:42:47.700 --> 1:42:54.260]  and deaths with just a 30-minute infusion, here's what I'm seeing in this monoclonal
[1:42:54.260 --> 1:43:01.140]  antibody infusion center, I'm seeing people while they're sitting in a chair for 59 years
[1:43:01.140 --> 1:43:09.140]  old in good health, I'm not working in the front line, so my type is not recommended
[1:43:09.140 --> 1:43:11.140]  to get vaccination.
[1:43:11.140 --> 1:43:18.020]  That was the current CEO of Pfizer just a few months ago on a national TV interview saying,
[1:43:18.020 --> 1:43:25.540]  oh, he doesn't need to take the so-called mRNA vaccine that's really a gene therapy,
[1:43:25.540 --> 1:43:28.860]  he said, you know, he's 50-something years old, he's healthy, he doesn't need it, it's
[1:43:28.860 --> 1:43:33.860]  at risk people, but that's not what his PR firms that have bought off the politicians
[1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:38.100]  over 100 countries say, they say you've got to take a dab at job or leave your house or
[1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:44.420]  get on a plane or a train or even get outside your home for one hour a day to live in Australia.
[1:43:44.420 --> 1:43:49.500]  So remember, the White House is exempt, Congress and their staff are exempt, the Postal Service
[1:43:49.500 --> 1:43:54.300]  is exempt, all these big corporate heads are exempt, they're not taking their poison vaccine,
[1:43:54.300 --> 1:44:20.300]  they're pushing it on you, wake up folks, wake up.
[1:44:20.300 --> 1:44:29.000]  You know, for the next 15 days to flatten the curve, I also need you to wear masks and
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:38.260]  I also need you to only shop at mega corporations, that way we can consolidate control and bankrupt
[1:44:38.260 --> 1:44:42.700]  the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:46.560]  You will then be my slaves, not old.
[1:44:46.560 --> 1:44:53.480]  And then you get that special shot and get him from copra will remove your immune system
[1:44:53.480 --> 1:44:56.940]  So you'll be depended on me for the rest of your miserable lives

[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:17.680]  weren't going to be shoplifting could you imagine going up to a gas station and
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:22.320]  going inside the little mini-mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on how far
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:25.520]  do you think that would get you could you imagine as a teacher showing up to

[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:37.120]  offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction the
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:40.880]  globalist are running a psychological warfare operation on humanity only
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:45.000]  waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us and the mask is
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:48.920]  the sign of slavery we must inform the public that it's a fraud and it's
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:52.680]  dangerous and it causes major medical issues and it's dehumanizing and the

[1:47:07.720 --> 1:47:28.200]  here's what I'm seeing in this re in this monoclonal antibody infusion
[1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:34.440]  center I'm seeing people while they're sitting in a chair bored just sitting
[1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:38.720]  there getting this infusion there they're telling me I've had a headache for
[1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:43.240]  five days and it just went away they're telling me I have the burning in my
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:50.840]  chest is gone my body aches are gone the fatigue I had for days is gone I have
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:56.680]  more energy they're leaving with a smile I've joked that they crawl in and they
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:48:01.920]  walk out but we're seeing dramatic results and let me just interrupt you sir
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:06.760]  Trump took it and said within five six hours he felt like a new man I've had
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:11.080]  five of my crew because I got a big crew here who just went and got it when they
[1:48:11.080 --> 1:48:14.280]  got sick and literally went from not being able to breathe in the case of
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:18.760]  Zach I won't say his last name and he literally said in five hours the headache
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:22.160]  did not be able to breathe was he felt great in five hours now I'm not saying
[1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:26.560]  everybody's having that but everybody I know within five hours Joe Rogan one day
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:32.360]  gone I mean fever sweats can't breathe gone what in the hell is that
[1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:38.440]  Regeneron doing well it's an antibody antibodies are like a lock and key they
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:43.800]  they only bind to one specific thing called an antigen which is a on the
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:49.560]  cell surface of a cancer cell or it's on the outside of a virus and so you see an
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:55.960]  antibody binding to an antigen like lock and key and and so it goes through your
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:48:59.400]  bloodstream looking for the virus binding to the virus and immediately
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:05.400]  triggering your immune system to kill the virus and so literally the virus is
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:09.680]  being it's like the antibodies are on a search and destroy mission they're
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:13.720]  immediately going and finding the virus and killing all the viruses in the
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:18.400]  bloodstream and so as they're sitting in the chair they literally are having
[1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:23.480]  their symptoms leave their body because the virus is being killed on contact
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:28.840]  with the antibody this is an antibody that's multiplied in the lab and as it
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:34.840]  as it goes through your bloodstream it'll be cleared out of your body by your
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:39.480]  spleen by your liver by your kidneys those are the filtering systems that God
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:44.640]  gave us and so those will clear those antibodies out but while they're there
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:50.640]  they're having a tremendous benefit for the people and so 70% decrease in death
[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:54.640]  and hospitalizations just with a 30-minute infusion but you can also
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:50:00.360]  give this as four subcutaneous shots which takes just a minute so there are
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:03.720]  infusion centers that are being regener on centers that are being set up in
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:09.520]  Florida and Texas all in many states where they're expecting to see 300 people
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:14.160]  a day you're the expert on this you're the expert on this and you told me about
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:18.240]  the treatments to save my dad hands down I really appreciate you also save Rob do
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:23.400]  that's a separate subject but expanding on that is there because I get this for
[1:50:23.400 --> 1:50:26.880]  other doctors and I know Dr. McCullough is a great guy and he said oh yes we
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:29.360]  are on it's much better than you know I literally he's not involved and he just
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:34.640]  says this is two instead of one again I'm a layman here but is there I saw that
[1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:39.000]  Biden set a board up it's talking about not giving it to people that aren't
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:46.680]  vaccinated is that true so if he said it first of all I think you need to verify
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:52.800]  and so I don't I actually don't listen to him very much I'm busy taking care of
[1:50:52.800 --> 1:50:58.360]  people and I'm interested in facts and science so we don't get a lot of Biden
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:03.120]  so it's probably not true right so I don't know what he's saying and and if
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:09.080]  he says it I'm almost expecting something else but I will say facts and
[1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:16.680]  science randomized controlled trials the gold standard for evidence-based medicine
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:22.400]  the stoic trial the principal trial out of Oxford University showing Budevson
[1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:26.600]  night is effective something that you broke the news on a year ago to your
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:30.560]  credit Alex when other people were not paying attention or suppressing this
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:35.120]  information they were censoring this information you were getting it out that
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:39.320]  Budevson I can save lives for COVID patients and then a year later I
[1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:44.720]  experienced with my father yes and I'll tell you something else that's
[1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:49.840]  critical Budevson I when I broke that story a year ago I talked about my
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:56.400]  protocol which was Budevson I'd as a nebulizer treatment also antibiotic
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:03.360]  called chlorethromycin and an aspirin and the aspirin I saw a study the other
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:09.040]  day at the NIH database that said that 14.1% of COVID patients in the
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:15.680]  hospital experience venous thromboemboly basically clots which would
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:20.880]  equal a heart attack a stroke or a pulmonary embolism the lungs and so the
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:25.760]  aspirin was part of the strategy a year ago and now we have a study verifying
[1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:31.560]  that it's totally appropriate validating it and so an aspirin a day is
[1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:37.080]  critical as long as not allergic to it and the antibiotic that I chose was
[1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:42.960]  chlorethromycin because our risk of a secondary bacterial pneumonia is the
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:48.400]  number one risk factor for that is a viral respiratory infection guess what
[1:52:48.400 --> 1:52:53.480]  COVID is and so we have we can be proactive we can empirically treat
[1:52:53.480 --> 1:52:58.920]  people and I wrote a case study and published it a year ago explaining all
[1:52:58.920 --> 1:53:05.880]  of these things with 50 articles that we referenced peer reviewed studies and so
[1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:10.160]  this was not something that was hidden in the dark and you know you've
[1:53:10.160 --> 1:53:16.120]  experienced censorship when I wrote this a year ago I said that Budevson I was
[1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:21.640]  the silver bullet of my strategy I don't know Alex what you would call a
[1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:26.840]  medicine that can prevent 90% of hospitalizations ER visits and urgent
[1:53:26.840 --> 1:53:34.720]  care visits for a deadly pandemic but I think maybe maybe something that
[1:53:34.720 --> 1:53:40.120]  prevents 90% would be a silver bullet and so but I got a lot of pushback
[1:53:40.120 --> 1:53:45.560]  Fauci got Matthew McConaughey to do a viral a an interview on the internet
[1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:50.280]  and McConaughey asked him hey what about you that's not people thinks that
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:54.880]  that works for COVID and and Fauci said well in reality Matthew it's just a
[1:53:54.880 --> 1:54:04.800]  placebo and so how much death and destruction resulted from him putting
[1:54:04.800 --> 1:54:08.480]  out misinformation because either he's saying the wrong thing or Oxford
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:12.840]  University is wrong with their science randomized controlled trials let me just
[1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:20.800]  stop you doctor because Fauci yesterday on CNN I played the clip on my Friday
[1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:28.560]  show he said that quote he was asked by Sanjay Gupta and by Anderson Cooper is
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:32.640]  there any truth to this natural immunity thing that's not even exist and
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:38.200]  Fauci said quote I don't know that's not as bad as the surgeon general I'm sure
[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:43.200]  using the video said oh natural immunity is not as good as as this even though
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:48.520]  the Israeli study says 13 27 times I'm not a doctor I only went to college for
[1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:52.080]  one year but I remember like eighth grade biology they said learned immunity was
[1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:57.880]  the best so what in the world's going on there well there's a tremendous amount
[1:54:57.880 --> 1:55:02.400]  of misinformation and that's the first thing that I appreciate Fauci saying is
[1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:08.160]  he doesn't know finally he admitted it but if you look at Washington University
[1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:14.680]  School of Medicine they've been drawing blood from COVID survivors for up to a
[1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:19.480]  year now and they have found high levels of antibodies in people who have
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:26.160]  recovered from mild COVID cases and so kudos to them for science but you remember
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:30.760]  Fauci held up three fingers and said well if you've recovered from COVID you
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:35.280]  only have protection for three months and I and I have said in interviews that
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:41.080]  maybe he pulled that out of thin air other people say that he pulled it out
[1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:45.440]  of somewhere else but he had no randomized controlled trial to quote what
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:53.880]  he was saying he said many things he talks to us like he's a butcher doesn't
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:57.320]  even talk that and I mean talks more intelligent he's like I wouldn't want
[1:55:57.320 --> 1:56:01.480]  my kids without a mask and before don't you don't need a mask and you see it's
[1:56:01.480 --> 1:56:06.840]  all contradictory and that little gangster accent it's ridiculous yeah
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:11.280]  well the bottom line is everything he said that I've heard I've never heard
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:15.680]  him say based on this randomized controlled trial based on this science
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:20.720]  all I've heard is don't wear a mask it doesn't give the protection that you
[1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:24.440]  think it work it does and then he says maybe we should wear a mask because it's
[1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:28.920]  a symbol we're in it together and then he says wear a mask and then he says
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:31.680]  maybe two masks and then he says if you get the shot you don't have to wear a
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:34.760]  mask and then he says if you get the shot you have to wear a mask and he
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:40.560]  never offers scientific evidence and so at some point you got to say who's
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:46.520]  responsible for putting him in front of the microphone and should he be there I
[1:56:46.520 --> 1:56:54.560]  think at bottom line is clearly people have durable lasting immunity just as
[1:56:54.560 --> 1:57:01.280]  Senator Rand Paul Dr. Rand Paul has made the case and I was a question just as
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:05.040]  a citizen and as a doctor don't even talk about what you can fix getting people
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:08.040]  things that actually work you know they're gonna lie they're gonna cheat
[1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:10.760]  they're with big pharma that's a takeover it's terrible you're just gonna
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:14.000]  counter with hey this really works in that overall belief in the power of the
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:17.360]  people in good positions and others to tell the truth but what do you make of
[1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:23.080]  we had a year and a half ago Fauci in deep water in 2015 at North Carolina with
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:26.000]  scientists going you're doing a function with stuff that came out with the
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:30.840]  former head of Pfizer came out on Fox's and said listen he made stuff far
[1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:35.240]  worse than that which is the doomsday stuff it's much worse and and so to know
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:39.880]  he would tell senator Paul and others no we never did any gain of function when
[1:57:39.880 --> 1:57:43.680]  he held gain of function conferences and called for it when in the emails
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:48.360]  dozens of times about 900 pages of it he says I want gain of function merge by
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:51.840]  now you've heard me talk about the bio pros and how they're creating amazing
[1:57:51.840 --> 1:57:56.680]  products they've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio
[1:57:56.680 --> 1:58:00.800]  remediation products bringing industrial level technology to the everyday
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:04.800]  consumer they're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patent and
[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:09.880]  delivery system the bio pros are excited to release bio drain pro a product
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:13.720]  specifically designed to establish healthy drains pipes and overall plumbing

[1:58:48.920 --> 1:58:53.960]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul I've ever
[1:58:53.960 --> 1:59:00.680]  had in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of loss everybody else has and
[1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:09.280]  it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and
[1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:17.600]  died and bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away and I see the
[1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:21.720]  general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral
[1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:28.320]  psychologically controlled 20 and I know we're being fed into this globalist
[1:59:28.320 --> 1:59:34.400]  being grounded it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then
[1:59:34.400 --> 1:59:39.360]  growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming
[1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:43.600]  back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer
[1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:47.840]  and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species
[1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:56.960]  as we know it you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:03.160 --> 2:00:08.480]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind
[2:00:08.480 --> 2:00:11.480]  there was something so pleasant about that play
[2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:15.760]  in deep water in 2015 in North Carolina was scientists going you're doing a
[2:00:15.760 --> 2:00:19.960]  function with stuff that came out with the former head of the Pfizer came out
[2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:23.640]  on Fox history and said listen he made stuff far worse than that which is the
[2:00:23.640 --> 2:00:28.280]  doomsday stuff it's much worse and and so to know he would tell senator Paul
[2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:32.680]  and others no we never did any gain of function when he held gain of function
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:36.800]  conferences and called for it when in the emails dozens of times about 900
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:41.120]  pages of it he says I want gain of function merge these five viruses and
[2:00:41.120 --> 2:00:45.520]  then make sure it can jump into humans I mean it's literally the smoking
[2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:51.160]  gun of him admitting it and then saying it's preposterous you don't know the
[2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:54.640]  science I've never been involved in gain of function when he's saying merge
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:00:58.720]  viruses artificially give him an HIV spike protein and then make sure it
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:03.240]  jumps in humans I mean it's it's it what this guy's a villain look we know why
[2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:08.960]  he's lying to us I think he's like I mean we see these crazy doctors and Joseph
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:12.800]  Mingle types throughout history there's a small percentage of psychos that want
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:16.200]  to become medical workers we know so they can carry out with some bravery and
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:19.640]  I'll just say it I know you're not gonna speculate doctor but all the evidence
[2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:25.800]  points towards he's a bad actor he's a psychotic you know I can't argue with
[2:01:25.800 --> 2:01:31.640]  you that I would say that he's he's made some decisions that have been
[2:01:31.640 --> 2:01:36.680]  devastating to our people in the United States and around the world now we know
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:41.600]  that it was a bad idea to close schools a year ago because children could have
[2:01:41.600 --> 2:01:47.600]  been that buffer to the pandemic you know they would have contributed to herd
[2:01:47.600 --> 2:01:54.040]  immunity because we had just as many children die last year in 2020 from
[2:01:54.040 --> 2:02:00.320]  COVID as have died from school bus related accidents and so people heard
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:04.160]  me heard immunity that don't understand it because you know I've seen another
[2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:07.720]  thing the Democrats and Fauci say is all that doesn't exist that's like saying the
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:12.560]  sky doesn't exist explain it to them so when you have enough people in the
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:18.240]  community that have been exposed to a virus like the H1N1 pandemic that we
[2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:22.840]  had in 2009 there was a deadly respiratory virus that was highly
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:27.120]  contagious killing tens of thousands of Americans but when you have enough of the
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:32.680]  population that's been exposed to that virus and has recovered and has immunity
[2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:37.640]  that is lasting when that virus comes to them they will not carry that virus
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:41.400]  they will not spread that virus that virus cannot make them sick again because
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:46.920]  of their natural immune system functioning and so that's what causes
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:53.280]  herd immunity and so we made it through a deadly pandemic in 2009 without one
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:03:00.480]  vaccine without one mandated shot without the risk of tens of thousands of
[2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:05.800]  people having complications from a from a vaccine without using an
[2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:13.400]  experimental gene therapy and so how do we do that well that was natural herd
[2:03:13.400 --> 2:03:19.160]  immunity H1N1 pandemic a deadly virus pandemic in the United States and it
[2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:24.200]  was over quickly and we did not close schools we did not say that everyone has
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:29.320]  to wear a mask we did not have lockdowns we did not do all of the of the
[2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:33.720]  amazing things that they've come up with in the last year and how did it work
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:39.520]  this year compared to the original compared to 2009 so herd immunity is
[2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:44.600]  when you have enough of the population that has recovered and they are protected
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:50.000]  and they can't spread the virus and so that is a that is a real way out of the
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.920]  pandemic we treat people that are sick with effective proven inexpensive
[2:03:54.920 --> 2:04:02.800]  strategies and we we educate the people with facts instead of propaganda and we
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:08.960]  drop failed strategies and if it didn't work the first time well we who would
[2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:13.840]  say do it again and but that's what we're hearing and then you need to deal
[2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:16.040]  with the problem that you brought up earlier
[2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:21.400]  senator Tom Cotton has been saying that this looks like it could be a bio weapon
[2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:27.040]  that's germ warfare that's what I've heard him basically saying for
[2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:31.760]  approximately a year and he gets to hear intel intelligence that I don't get to
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.960]  hear and then you have senator Rand Paul showing evidence of gain of function
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:44.880]  testing and research to make a deadly virus in the Wuhan lab and so I'm
[2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:49.040]  saying there's a lot of evidence here that we are dealing with germ warfare
[2:04:49.040 --> 2:04:55.120]  there are people that are saying that so I can tell you that this COVID that
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:05:00.560]  we're dealing with is a disease that we've never seen before so the placebo
[2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:05.920]  that they have used that the FDA has allowed them to use has often been
[2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:11.200]  another vaccine a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:17.800]  death and damage in its own right that it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the
[2:05:17.800 --> 2:05:22.560]  vaccine a known neurotoxin a known immunotoxin a known poison in human
[2:05:22.560 --> 2:05:28.000]  beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo totally inappropriate this is
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:34.360]  not good science it is not science at all it is an effort to cover up the true
[2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:39.200]  adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they can get through the low
[2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:44.320]  barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and on to the market that is the
[2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:49.000]  only concern Dr. Wakefield is just one of many informed voices in the film

[2:06:12.240 --> 2:06:16.400]  well sir you read the letters from Fauci I'm sure you've seen I've been shown on
[2:06:16.400 --> 2:06:21.240]  air every day it's him ordering them to combine all these this bat and this this
[2:06:21.240 --> 2:06:24.760]  animal and this animal and then add a protein to it and make sure it can jump
[2:06:24.760 --> 2:06:29.680]  into humans I mean it's it's it's it says it right there I mean wow and the
[2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:34.320]  claim evolutionary all these things just did this it's like saying a fine Swiss
[2:06:34.320 --> 2:06:39.080]  watch was just sand in the desert of you know the Sahara made it I mean we have
[2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:44.360]  them so yeah absolutely well I would say in general the American people are not
[2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:49.080]  that gullible that there is still common sense in the United States and that the
[2:06:49.080 --> 2:06:56.400]  public is not as stupid as Fauci may think we are actually we can say wow
[2:06:56.400 --> 2:06:59.580]  all the evidence sure looks like this is a different kind of disease than we've
[2:06:59.580 --> 2:07:04.480]  ever had before and sure is suspicious that their only strategy that they'll
[2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:10.040]  offer is just a vaccine and sure is interesting that they're suppressing the
[2:07:10.040 --> 2:07:14.640]  reality that there are effective early outpatient treatment strategies from
[2:07:14.640 --> 2:07:20.520]  reputable sources that are verified by the Democrats of the deep state are in
[2:07:20.520 --> 2:07:26.320]  with the Chinese it you know it's interesting that the virus did come
[2:07:26.320 --> 2:07:31.480]  from China for the government of China was involved in it with the Wuhan lab
[2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:37.080]  and that that does look like that's the situation to me I'm convinced of that
[2:07:37.080 --> 2:07:42.640]  personally that's my opinion and then then you look at the solutions seem to
[2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:47.880]  be coming out of China the the masks are made in China the gal the PPEs are made
[2:07:47.880 --> 2:07:51.920]  in China there's there seems to be the problem in the solution seems to be
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:57.040]  coming from the same source I don't think that China in itself is the whole
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:08:02.280]  problem but this is the United States of America where people should have
[2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:08.560]  patient rights is starting to look a lot more like a social estate to me where
[2:08:08.560 --> 2:08:14.480]  they're talking about possibly the latest thing I've heard is we're with the
[2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:22.400]  monoclonal antibody infusion center and what I heard yesterday was that the
[2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:26.720]  federal government might be taking over the distribution of Regeneron I hope
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:33.160]  not and that they might actually start decreasing or rationing the the Regeneron
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:39.280]  I hope not but rationing of health care is what you see in socialized socialist
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:45.640]  countries and it doesn't work very well and it's a disaster rationing of
[2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:50.160]  anything should not be you've got a solution to a problem that keeps them
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:54.600]  in power they're not gonna want that out there and all I could say is what a
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:59.160]  blessing Regeneron I mean I'm all of these companies you develop miracle
[2:08:59.160 --> 2:09:02.560]  stuff like this I believe in medicine if it's applied properly and tested and
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:05.520]  and all the rest of it and correct me if I'm wrong but it's been around since
[2:09:05.520 --> 2:09:09.280]  1988 the company and they started with these you know two really smart
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:15.040]  scientists who went back to 1900 at the idea of creating a compound for each
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:18.680]  disease that would target the actual cause silver bullets what they called
[2:09:18.680 --> 2:09:23.160]  it and then they've gone out gotten a bunch of stuff patented for all sorts of
[2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:28.440]  things and for their size per capita the most profitable company out there
[2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:31.800]  which is good and they don't have liability protection like the vaccine
[2:09:31.800 --> 2:09:35.520]  makers which I don't think they should have and then the things we see really
[2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:39.120]  work and are great so I want those type of things my god if I'm sick I want
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:42.720]  there's some deadly thing out there I want it but but unfortunately these
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:46.200]  vaccines we look at Israel certain I know you have the floor 30 minutes we
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:49.520]  have left I know you're really busy here this evening you're giving us your
[2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:53.320]  time but what do you make of all the graphs out of Israel out of the UN
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:57.480]  everywhere India the same numbers Sweden the same numbers they're not
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:00.360]  vaccinating they're doing all this other stuff almost nobody dying or sick
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:04.640]  Israel most vaccinated the most sick and it's repeated all over the place the
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:11.160]  more vaccinated the more sick what do you make of these graphs Dr. Bartlett
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:16.920]  well let's just use common sense like you always do Alex you know if you have
[2:10:16.920 --> 2:10:21.240]  more people vaccinated you should start seeing less of the disease if they if it
[2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:28.520]  works and so in Israel 85% vaccination rate they're having the same problem the
[2:10:28.520 --> 2:10:34.440]  same surge this and so and they're also starting to admit that the vaccines
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:39.960]  effectiveness is waning I think I heard a month ago there was only 39% effective
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:45.080]  according to Israel I think you're going to see that drop to zero eventually
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:52.080]  because of the variants that are coming out but you look at what's happening in
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:56.400]  Israel and what I saw when I looked at it my understanding is four out of five
[2:10:56.400 --> 2:11:01.840]  people in the hospital in Israel have been vaccinated now and so does is that
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:08.480]  evidence that the vaccine is working or look where we are where I'd say we're
[2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:14.360]  about 41% vaccinated in West Texas and I'd say about 41% of the people that come
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:21.000]  in the center that are sick needing the infusion have been vaccinated I'd say
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:27.160]  it almost looks like maybe it's not a winning strategy but independent of that
[2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:32.400]  I also work in the emergency room as an emergency room doctor and so I have seen
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:37.720]  people who have come in injured from the vaccine and so they've come in they've
[2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:43.520]  they got the vaccine at a pharmacy they immediately had a reaction where they
[2:11:43.520 --> 2:11:47.520]  felt like they were going to pass out go home and they come into my emergency
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:50.760]  room with the worst headache they've ever had they can't feel anything on the
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:56.760]  left side of their body they can't move their left arm and they only received
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:12:00.160]  the vaccine because the in-laws wouldn't visit if they didn't get the vaccine
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:04.080]  because of the propaganda that's the left arm because I've heard people have
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:06.880]  taken it say that does that mean cardiac because I guess we have a heart
[2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:10.680]  attack the left arm ceases up or what does that mean I'm talking about stroke
[2:12:10.680 --> 2:12:14.720]  symptoms yeah stroke symptoms where they can't fit they have sensory deficit and
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:20.120]  motor deficit on the same side or is that lipid lipid getting the stuff
[2:12:20.120 --> 2:12:27.760]  across the blood brain barrier as they admit happens so there's a lot of a lot
[2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:31.640]  of things that are going on that are not that are not I'm gonna mention a few
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:36.200]  other things that I'm seeing I saw a lady who after the vaccine several hours
[2:12:36.200 --> 2:12:39.200]  later she's my patient in the emergency room her legs won't work when she tries
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:45.520]  to stand up she has transverse myelitis I saw a gentleman who's a hard worker
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:52.840]  works as a landscaper and he received the first shot the first COVID shot and
[2:12:52.840 --> 2:12:57.680]  he comes in to see me two weeks after that shot and he's had two weeks of
[2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:03.440]  shortness of breath and we have to wait until we you put him on supplemental
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:06.840]  oxygen and he can catch his breath before he can tell us that he had gotten
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:10.520]  the shot and immediately felt short of breath and we resuscitate him enough that
[2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:15.160]  he can go home but I see him five most later in the emergency room and he's a
[2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:20.080]  pulmonary cripple now I've seen the college students that come in who are
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:25.600]  18 years old and healthy with no health problems and they come into as my
[2:13:25.600 --> 2:13:28.400]  patient in the emergency room and they have four days where they can't think
[2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:32.240]  clearly they feel like they're gonna pass out their week their lightheaded and
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:37.160]  what happened four days ago they received their COVID shot and so these
[2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:41.760]  things I have seen I have been the attending emergency room doctor for
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:49.480]  these specific complications I have managed these myself the vaccine has
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:55.880]  risk and the fact that we're not giving informed consent and we're not telling
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:14:01.720]  patients in the messaging that's coming out on TV and radio when they say roll
[2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:07.000]  up your sleeve what kind of informed consent is that they should be saying
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:12.440]  here's the risk and here's the benefit I've seen evidence of the risk I've
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:19.320]  seen people harmed from the vaccine and I've presented this testimony to the
[2:14:19.320 --> 2:14:24.280]  Texas Senate earlier this year and there are other doctors who have done the
[2:14:24.280 --> 2:14:30.560]  same but where's the benefit if you look at Israel and they're having four out of
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:36.480]  five people in the hospital during this surge of new cases have been
[2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:42.480]  vaccinated I don't see the benefit or if I see that a lot of the people that are
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:48.200]  coming in the infusion center have been vaccinated they didn't benefit from the
[2:14:48.200 --> 2:14:54.600]  shot so I see I don't see a lot of benefit I see I have seen the real risk
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:15:01.280]  and at the same time a year ago I said why are we even talking about vaccines
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:07.400]  because we have effective early outpatient therapies we have a winning
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:11.000]  strategy we have a way out of this pandemic we still have a way out of
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:15.920]  this pandemic but we need to deal with where did these come from and are any
[2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:20.600]  other viruses going to come from a similar source Alex so think about that
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:26.080]  where did SARS-2 come from Senator Tom Cotton Senator Rand Paul they've
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:30.120]  they've given us a lot of evidence to the whole world to their credit those
[2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:35.720]  two men have dealt with they have proven they have presented evidence and they
[2:15:35.720 --> 2:15:42.960]  have talked science and these are men who have talked about solid credible
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:48.040]  information and they have and they presented it to the world so I'm saying
[2:15:48.040 --> 2:15:58.280]  delta variant lambda variant move it are are these really mutations hey
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:02.880]  everybody if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival

[2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:10.680]  class not in communist China not in Mexico not in the United States not
[2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:16.240]  anywhere is there a real study of the planet's ruling class that's done by
[2:18:16.240 --> 2:18:20.600]  design the large central banks that basically control the planet will
[2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:25.560]  penalize and target any academics that look into say the Anglo-American
[2:18:25.560 --> 2:18:29.000]  establishment the founder the Bilderberg group the trilateral commission the
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:33.680]  United Nations the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers until
[2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:37.600]  10 years ago the media said the control corporate media the Bilderberg group
[2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:42.760]  didn't exist well now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head show
[2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:47.000]  the steering committee is called Schwab and he has set up the great reset at
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:51.280]  global government and if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the
[2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:55.360]  globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate
[2:18:55.360 --> 2:18:59.160]  takeover we don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat them easily we've
[2:18:59.160 --> 2:19:03.120]  all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:07.200]  concentration camp in World War two that when they came for one group he
[2:19:07.200 --> 2:19:10.440]  wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:13.560]  him those nobody else to stand up all the global social credit score the
[2:19:13.560 --> 2:19:17.280]  China's putting in its banning people to three hours of video games a week and
[2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:20.960]  if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell again well that's
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:24.360]  that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of covid
[2:19:24.360 --> 2:19:28.280]  vaccine passports they even admit it now there's they has going to be a carbon
[2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:31.920]  tax attached to it they're going to track where you go what you do and decide
[2:19:31.920 --> 2:19:35.480]  where you can go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns are about
[2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:40.480]  you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the leftist having fun
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:43.440]  right now all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the
[2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:47.040]  power structure they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well we
[2:19:47.040 --> 2:19:50.360]  need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be
[2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:58.120]  enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalist you're listening to
[2:19:58.120 --> 2:20:04.800]  the alex jones show you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:31.800]  are are these really mutations because back in March of 2020 three most into
[2:20:31.800 --> 2:20:41.000]  this pandemic iceland studied the genome of every SARS virus out of their SARS
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:47.160]  page out of their covid patients in iceland and they had found 243 mutations
[2:20:47.160 --> 2:20:53.360]  three months into this pandemic now we have no doubt thousands probably tens of
[2:20:53.360 --> 2:21:00.920]  thousands of mutations so is delta variant just a mutation or where did
[2:21:00.920 --> 2:21:06.640]  SARS to come from and where are these new things coming from and so that is
[2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:10.640]  really let's just go there clearly that's how you do a bio weapon rollout and
[2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:15.200]  we had a very chilling statement a few days ago when biden made his big
[2:21:15.200 --> 2:21:19.320]  declaration of medical tyranny and federal federal authoritarianism and
[2:21:19.320 --> 2:21:23.000]  even mainline lawyers are saying it's the most dictatorial thing since
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:26.840]  Abraham Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln actually had a war going on inside the
[2:21:26.840 --> 2:21:30.200]  country whether you whatever side people choose there think the whole thing was a
[2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:36.760]  disaster but this is this is biden talking about oh a new pandemic is
[2:21:36.760 --> 2:21:41.440]  coming don't you worry here it is the key parts of my pandemic preparedness
[2:21:41.440 --> 2:21:46.280]  plan so that america isn't caught flat-footed with a new pandemic comes
[2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:51.880]  again as it will yeah you know as it will and fancy saying don't worry trumps
[2:21:51.880 --> 2:21:58.480]  gonna get hit by a big pandemic very soon as it will happen so so so I mean
[2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:02.440]  go where you're going now in more detail of what you're really saying here
[2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:08.480]  about how the democrats are some potica with the chai comms this this aids their
[2:22:08.480 --> 2:22:12.040]  takeover all the world we see governments declaring new world order
[2:22:12.040 --> 2:22:15.080]  saying we're gonna lock you in your house forever you can't leave unless you
[2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:18.560]  take the shots the shots don't work more shots the studies show lower your
[2:22:18.560 --> 2:22:22.440]  immunity I mean doc you're a smart guy and you're all about the science and I
[2:22:22.440 --> 2:22:25.880]  know you're only saying things that are documented or leading people do their own
[2:22:25.880 --> 2:22:30.920]  research but this is a citizen you know as a patriot what do you really think's
[2:22:30.920 --> 2:22:34.080]  going on here because obviously this is a corporate takeover obviously they're
[2:22:34.080 --> 2:22:37.640]  suppressing treatments that really help people I mean this is really bad stuff
[2:22:37.640 --> 2:22:44.720]  what do you really think's happening Alex after 9-11 I as an emergency room
[2:22:44.720 --> 2:22:49.840]  doctor I was trained in how to take care of people in the emergency room if
[2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:55.160]  there was a nuclear war if there was chemical warfare if there was bio weapons
[2:22:55.160 --> 2:23:02.040]  used and so that was continuing education that I received after 9-11 and we
[2:23:02.040 --> 2:23:09.520]  know that germ warfare bio weapons have been used in recent times and when well
[2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:14.640]  I think you and I know teenagers may not be aware of anthrax when that was
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:20.840]  mailed to people in Congress that's a bio weapon there's there's been sarin
[2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:27.000]  used there have been other bio weapons used but bio weapons created and
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:35.520]  discussed so publicly like at the Wuhan lab I think this is amazing that the
[2:23:35.520 --> 2:23:43.400]  obvious isn't being stated that we we are having I think the let's let's look
[2:23:43.400 --> 2:23:49.280]  at another clue why why is Fauci not calling this the Delta mutant the
[2:23:49.280 --> 2:23:54.000]  mutation because that would be really hard for doctors to swallow and really
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:58.560]  hard for scientists to swallow because there's been so many mutations already
[2:23:58.560 --> 2:24:05.720]  of this virus to call it a variant hmm well where did that SARS-2 variant come
[2:24:05.720 --> 2:24:13.040]  from I think that Tom Cotton is correct I think that Rand Paul is correct and
[2:24:13.040 --> 2:24:19.400]  that they're both very brave to inform the world from the Senate floor of
[2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:25.280]  evidence that they have and so I think we do need this is where governments and
[2:24:25.280 --> 2:24:31.320]  military are involved where we have I think there's strong evidence that this
[2:24:31.320 --> 2:24:37.520]  is a bio weapon and fortunately again the good news is we're not helpless or
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:41.720]  hopeless at this point we do have effective treatment strategies and
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:46.400]  they've been employed around the world but just to stop because you're really
[2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:52.200]  a smart guy on on this I want to pick your brain clearly they developed a bunch
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:55.320]  of variants again even the former head of Pfizer was on Fox News I meant to
[2:24:55.320 --> 2:24:58.520]  play the clip on Friday I did maybe have your gone will play because I don't want
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:04.000]  to take every time with that but again the former head of Pfizer said look
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:09.080]  Fauci made far worse things at labs at Wuhan so it looks like there's part of
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:12.960]  the American establishment that's not suicidal and and wants this to stop
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:16.560]  because that's what a lot of smart people I've talked to in former in US
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:20.160]  intelligence high level highest level I know you've talked to some people that
[2:25:20.160 --> 2:25:25.560]  had it up the US intelligence agencies will leave it that you know that no
[2:25:25.560 --> 2:25:29.440]  that's what this is and but we have to go to war with China if they did that and
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:32.600]  we know part of our establishment was in bed doing this as well but I think
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:36.840]  finally people that are patriots get China's gonna win this war and the
[2:25:36.840 --> 2:25:39.840]  globalist are gonna win it with them and we don't start stopping these people so
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:43.000]  you're right I see Rand Paul saying arrest Fauci I see cotton saying and I
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.080]  see others saying it and so I think we're moving in the right direction but
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:49.560]  Americans better be praying and they better understand how much danger we're
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:52.440]  all in and we need to all have courage to tell the truth because we're at a
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:56.720]  crossroads right now it's what I think you're saying doctor that's exactly what
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:00.840]  I'm saying and and I couldn't have said it better people need to pray this is
[2:26:00.840 --> 2:26:07.800]  still one nation under God and this is an exceptional nation and it is the best
[2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:11.920]  country in the world I've done led medical missions around the world to many
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:17.240]  countries helping people in desperate situations and now we're in a desperate
[2:26:17.240 --> 2:26:23.800]  situation around the world including in our own home land and so yes we it needs
[2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:28.680]  to start with prayer I think everyone needs to first of all be informed they
[2:26:28.680 --> 2:26:33.760]  cannot be passive they cannot be just absorbing whatever comes through the
[2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:40.360]  mainstream media I think at this point it's been proven to be in many times
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:47.120]  totally erroneous and if you there was a you you alluded it to it earlier that
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:54.200]  that there was a government there was a government that set a doctor as their
[2:26:54.200 --> 2:26:59.160]  number one spokesman for health care and whatever he said went and nobody
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:04.840]  questioned it or they'd be punished and his name was Joseph Mengele and so has
[2:27:04.840 --> 2:27:08.960]  that happened before it has happened before people need to be careful what
[2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:12.480]  they listen to because if you keep listening to the same thing over and
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:16.920]  over you might start believing it so you need if someone has been proven to be
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:23.880]  a source of wrong information then erroneous information over and over again
[2:27:23.880 --> 2:27:29.640]  you need to if you hear his voice turn it off don't listen to that and look
[2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:34.840]  seek out real information and and where you are do what you can with what you
[2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:38.440]  got I say roll up your sleeves to help your fellow American roll up your
[2:27:38.440 --> 2:27:42.440]  sleeves to help your fellow American and let's go with a winning strategy of
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:47.000]  early effective outpatient treatment but even when someone's in the hospital it's
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  not hopeless Alex we're seeing we're hearing reports of people who have been
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:56.960]  in the ICU who have been given a few desinite nebulizer treatments and they've
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:02.920]  been rescued off of ventilators out of the ICU and brought home and so I've I
[2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:09.120]  have reports of that from California to Florida to Georgia to Texas to Indiana
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:15.720]  and so it the truth is spreading we do have effective treatments and effective
[2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:20.320]  therapies and these should not be ignored they've been suppressed I've been
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:25.080]  censored on every level well that was my next question to know and I mean have
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:28.000]  it really sink in it's not just background noise please share the links
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:32.320]  please share this video I don't care about money or being famous or any of
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:36.480]  that okay I got into this to fight gun control and open borders and globalism
[2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:39.560]  28 years ago you know the doctor got into it because he's fulfilled helping
[2:28:39.560 --> 2:28:43.000]  people because we got our head screwed on you know partially straight we're all
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:47.120]  sinners none of us are perfect but these evil people have no guidance they just
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:50.040]  do whatever they want it's all about their own personal power
[2:28:50.040 --> 2:28:53.720]  how do you listen to know watching this on Saturday when it streams out when it's
[2:28:53.720 --> 2:28:58.200]  archived at man-off video this is a life-in-death and you don't know if you're
[2:28:58.200 --> 2:29:01.920]  concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:29:01.920 --> 2:29:06.600]  electricity this will be the most important message you'll hear this year
[2:29:06.600 --> 2:29:11.520]  here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock these
[2:29:11.520 --> 2:29:15.560]  emergency backup systems provide a life-saving backup power when you need
[2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:21.000]  it most and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:25.640]  fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the Sun whether
[2:29:25.640 --> 2:29:29.640]  it's wildfires dangerous whether power grid issues or just getting off the
[2:29:29.640 --> 2:29:34.560]  grid you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again even better
[2:29:34.560 --> 2:29:40.400]  all this week radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses to go
[2:29:40.400 --> 2:29:44.760]  to my solar backup dot com to learn more and check availability that's my solar
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:49.200]  backup dot com look for the free report crisis cooling how to make absolutely
[2:29:49.200 --> 2:29:54.040]  sure your meat milk and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage

[2:30:08.120 --> 2:30:15.120]  will take a special injection so that you will be safe but the injection is not
[2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:23.920]  ready yet and so I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to
[2:30:23.920 --> 2:30:30.840]  flatten the case I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop
[2:30:30.840 --> 2:30:38.400]  at mega corporations that way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the
[2:30:38.400 --> 2:30:45.440]  world economy leaving companies that only I own profitable you will then be
[2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:50.560]  my slaves oh and then you get that special shot of
[2:30:50.560 --> 2:31:01.080]  them for me for the rest of your miserable lives humanity is the main
[2:31:01.080 --> 2:31:04.880]  stakeholder on this planet but the big corporations for a hundred years with
[2:31:04.880 --> 2:31:08.560]  those that humans are bad and evil and a pestilence on the earth so that we begin
[2:31:08.560 --> 2:31:12.440]  to believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics base
[2:31:12.440 --> 2:31:16.520]  globalist take control the planet do you let a clown swab the head of the
[2:31:16.520 --> 2:31:20.560]  devil's groups own Wikipedia page he brags on there about how they're
[2:31:20.560 --> 2:31:25.120]  capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a
[2:31:25.120 --> 2:31:30.200]  corporate dictatorship under the UN they admit all of this they plan the
[2:31:30.200 --> 2:31:35.120]  lockdowns they release the viruses they think you're stupid and their plan is to
[2:31:35.120 --> 2:31:39.800]  slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over you
[2:31:39.800 --> 2:31:44.360]  and your lives that's how I was able to predict everything they did decades
[2:31:44.360 --> 2:31:49.600]  before they executed it word for word with total precision because they have
[2:31:49.600 --> 2:31:54.920]  a detailed battle plan we cover it live weekdays 11 a.m. at 3 p.m. at info wars.com

[2:31:59.800 --> 2:32:04.720]  life and death if you don't have freedom of speech if you don't have the right
[2:32:04.720 --> 2:32:08.800]  to be able to communicate then you don't have a future always when
[2:32:08.800 --> 2:32:12.120]  governments take away speech they then enslave the population and then they
[2:32:12.120 --> 2:32:15.480]  finally start exterminating the population and America the entire world
[2:32:15.480 --> 2:32:19.840]  is going down the tubes because the UN global is directed great reset that's

[2:33:00.240 --> 2:33:10.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:18.240 --> 2:33:23.880]  and you don't know like ripples in a palm you throw a pebble in who you're
[2:33:23.880 --> 2:33:28.800]  gonna affect share his websites like lives depend on it because it does
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:32.080]  because big pharma and big tech are trying to suppress it you desidine
[2:33:32.080 --> 2:33:38.480]  works dot com synergy health DPC dot com because when doctors finally listen
[2:33:38.480 --> 2:33:42.960]  and do it and they see the 180s that happened with people they're having a
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:48.360]  come to Jesus moment and I wanted to ask you this doctor I mean we know I mean
[2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:51.520]  you know my dad's a retire old surgeon and Dennis and he knew some stuff as he
[2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:54.160]  owned part of a hospital and medical management when I was growing up in
[2:33:54.160 --> 2:33:58.240]  Dallas and I remember he just said listen most hospitals are great people and
[2:33:58.240 --> 2:34:01.360]  most people are good because there's a small percentage of doctors that are
[2:34:01.360 --> 2:34:05.800]  crazy and nurses they're crazy I said why he said well you know I was one of
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:10.600]  those whiz kids taught my class was 15 I was in the plan to UT program you know
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:13.440]  you go to college when you're in high school and from East Texas they sent
[2:34:13.440 --> 2:34:17.440]  him to the MD Anderson for a summer in the cancer research wards the
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:21.240]  experimental stuff he saw that most doctors are really nice but some of
[2:34:21.240 --> 2:34:23.960]  them you know a few of them were crazy and like killing people he would describe
[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:27.280]  them shooting people up with like plutonium and stuff and then he said I
[2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:30.880]  knew a few doctors that were crazy at some Dallas hospitals and if somebody
[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:34.320]  came in they wouldn't they still had good brainwaves they go ahead just not
[2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:37.560]  giving treatment they were making money on the organs and I thought my dad's
[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:41.440]  full of it when I'm 16 you know he's telling me this then years later on 60
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:45.280]  minutes it happened in Dallas it came out they were basically letting people die
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:48.680]  you think gosh how could they do that well my dad would never lie to me he was a
[2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:52.880]  great great guy still great guy but I thought that was crazy but later I'm
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:57.080]  sitting there watching 60 minutes and it came out about Dallas and Chicago
[2:34:57.080 --> 2:35:01.320]  killing people for their organs only a few hospitals Austin doing some things
[2:35:01.320 --> 2:35:05.000]  too and so you look at this you look at people like Fauci to get in the research
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:08.480]  area and go up because they're ruthless and big pharma can put them in to do
[2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:12.600]  this type of thing and then you hear about nurses you know that kill 20 babies
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:16.040]  in San Antonio because they like to kill babies and it's just you know what
[2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:18.960]  percentage would you say of those psychos are out there what do they
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:24.360]  gravitate to because I noticed it's certain certain hospitals that had
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:28.480]  almost all the COVID deaths in all the major states in like you'd have hundreds
[2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:32.360]  of times or thousands of percent at this hospital or that but then almost none
[2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:36.920]  and another that saw these patients so so what is that culture have you seen
[2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:40.600]  things like that what do you call the mingla effect we all know about mad
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:46.160]  scientists mad doctors most are really great but then we also hear I mean they
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:49.840]  know like a lot of us want to building burns down they find a pipe bomb the
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:54.560]  FBI criminologist will investigate was it spy on the bomb squad or was it a
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:35:57.960]  firefighter because it turns out about a third of the time most firefighters are
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:01.800]  great most bomb squad people are great but sometimes they get bored and they
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:05.400]  plan a bomb themselves so you know it's like most truancy officers are great
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:08.600]  people but statistically they're the highest rate of pedophiles because that's
[2:36:08.600 --> 2:36:12.120]  where one wants to go to be able to do that so they want that authority and
[2:36:12.120 --> 2:36:16.320]  still these are good professions but you find that that that that sliver of evil
[2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:21.440]  hiding you know as an angel there what what are your like the military most
[2:36:21.440 --> 2:36:24.080]  people want to help people they have a warrior thing they want to strive they
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:27.560]  want to prove themselves they want to fight evil but there's that certain group
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:31.320]  that really wants to just torture people that happens any culture so how do we
[2:36:31.320 --> 2:36:34.960]  deal with that and how do we come to grips with doctors to be the best people
[2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:39.680]  nurses to be the best people in honor or they have that dark shadow that's there
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:44.600]  as well how do we deal with that I'm gonna tell you some of the worst people I
[2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:48.320]  know and you didn't have to prep me for this Alex some of the worst people I
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:54.680]  know are doctors and if a doctor has seen a treatment work and they and they
[2:36:54.680 --> 2:37:00.720]  suppress that and and they will not allow they do will not offer that to
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:05.480]  other patients I can't think of anything more evil because people have
[2:37:05.480 --> 2:37:10.680]  entrusted them with their lives with their loved ones lives and they are the
[2:37:10.680 --> 2:37:17.760]  authority figure and that that abuse of that position I think is is
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:24.560]  unforgivable and so I have I have seen that I know there that that exists that
[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:30.480]  that's happening now and then I also know that the masses of doctors nurses
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:35.480]  physician assistants nurse practitioners therapists have the right
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:39.160]  spirit they have the right heart they got into it because they wanted to help
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:47.120]  people but I am seen it does seem during a time of war and I believe we're at a
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:52.680]  time of war where there's cyber warfare happening this is if this is a bio weapon
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:58.680]  we call that germ warfare and definitely we've had embargoes and other
[2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:05.600]  things going on that are battling with other countries economic wars I think
[2:38:05.600 --> 2:38:11.080]  during times of war you see heroes appear and you see villains appear the
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:17.720]  worst what's in them already comes out and so I have seen some doctors do the
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:22.840]  what I have no explanation other than it's just pure evil at this point it's
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:27.240]  not ignorance at this point if you know something and you refuse to do the right
[2:38:27.240 --> 2:38:31.360]  thing when you're the one that could save a life then that's that's
[2:38:31.360 --> 2:38:37.640]  unforgivable and and there is a normalcy bias when I was younger I could not
[2:38:37.640 --> 2:38:42.880]  imagine that this was so but at this point I know that it's so because I've
[2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:46.880]  seen it with my own eyes Alex well absolutely my dad also watched in the
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:50.520]  80s I remember talking about at the dinner table Fauci famously blocked a
[2:38:50.520 --> 2:38:54.080]  bunch of HIV drugs that worked and then put forward bad ones I mean he's
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:39:00.640]  definitely a mingala type I think well I think we have many dangerous people
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:04.680]  that are called doctors right now and there are many brilliant doctors that
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:08.960]  are selfless that are not looking for this limelight that are not in this for
[2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:13.360]  the money they want to help other people and I think of Ben marble in
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:18.760]  Florida and Zelenko and in New York that are both been nominated for the Nobel
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:26.080]  Peace Prize and rightfully so I think of Dr. McCullough and Dallas and and I'll
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:33.120]  tell you Stella Immanuel down in Houston as a hero and we have many doctors
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:38.640]  that are rising to the cream always rises to the top and and we have that's
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:42.440]  what I was about to say it's good doctors and others that are rising to
[2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:47.440]  battle the evil elements of big pharma and the system it's really a very
[2:39:47.440 --> 2:39:50.600]  empowering time even though it's very dark you said it's a war and so we're
[2:39:50.600 --> 2:39:53.760]  seeing who people are but look at Fauci's eyes I mean I've known a lot of people
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:57.400]  up and around not just his actions I would not be around someone that looks
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:40:02.000]  like that he looks like a total power tripping lunatic Jack Kevorkian had
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:06.240]  that same crazy look and he would paint pictures of demons eating babies folks
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:11.360]  I'm not kidding I saw him on PBS with like babies coming out of women's wombs
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:15.520]  with demons eating him of course he wanted to kill healthy people I mean you
[2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:23.440]  could just see he can't even hide how bad he is well I'll tell you they're on the
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:28.000]  flip side yeah Alex I like not I can't disagree with you on the other side I
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:32.600]  will say that we have some of the best nurses and therapists and doctors in
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:37.240]  the world here in the United States and so I remember when my dad when I was
[2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:39.960]  growing up my mom would get really tired like three or four days a week as he was
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:43.280]  a doctor oral surgeon to answer the phone especially when it was his patients
[2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:46.760]  were in a car with a smashed face go wire their jaws or whatever and then go
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:50.000]  work 12 hours at the office I mean I watched my dad do that I don't know
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:54.120]  about Rand Paul's dad would famously go work three days a week for free
[2:40:54.120 --> 2:40:56.800]  basically something like three dollars they had to pay you you know at the
[2:40:56.800 --> 2:40:59.680]  Houston hospital that's because I remember being a dental assistant for
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:03.480]  viewers at college and like loving to like watch them drill the tooth and fix
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.760]  it and clean it felt good to help clean people's teeth and help fix broken teeth
[2:41:07.760 --> 2:41:11.280]  and just it felt good to like I mean I didn't like pus coming out of teeth I
[2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:14.720]  didn't like watching blood but it just felt good we were helping them and then
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:17.680]  so I understand that same thing of like wanting to help people it's a human
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:21.360]  instinct it's very rewarding it's addicting versus these people that love
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:25.620]  to do evil you said you do an hour I know you got to go it's your weekend you
[2:41:25.620 --> 2:41:30.360]  work 15 20 hours a day I know sir so just five minutes you've got the floor
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:33.520]  I've been asking a lot of questions just recap and any other key points you'd
[2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:37.240]  like to add dr. Bartlett and thanks for helping to save my dad because I know he
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:41.040]  looked like he was dead when I walked in there and 24 hours later less than 24
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:45.320]  hours later he was like 90% better so thank you sir and so just closing five
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:50.400]  six minutes you've got the floor well I appreciate that and I will say talking
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:56.360]  about your dad I'm gonna say that I had a similar uprising as you I I would tag
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:00.000]  along with my dad to the emergency room when I was in high school and college and
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:05.080]  we would be he would be he was a plastic and reconstructive surgeon he did hand
[2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:10.320]  surgery and so he is a real hero and a real role model for me and so I would
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:14.920]  see him work long hours there was many baseball games and many things that he
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:19.040]  missed because he was helping other people and I know where he was now that
[2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:26.080]  I'm an adult and I and I appreciate his role model for me and but we have we're
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:33.520]  in the middle of a crisis like we've never had before this is a disease we've
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:38.040]  never seen before but we have some effective treatment strategies there
[2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:42.400]  are therapies at work the Udesinite has been proven to be an effective tool
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:47.720]  against COVID early and late because late in COVID they have ARDS acute
[2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:53.040]  respiratory distress syndrome and there are studies at the NIH database that
[2:42:53.040 --> 2:42:58.320]  confirm that using nebulized Udesinite for ARDS will shut down the release of
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:02.240]  this your ruthless mega corporations who've taken over almost every
[2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:06.400]  government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form
[2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:10.400]  of operability you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know
[2:43:10.400 --> 2:43:14.800]  they're being targeted and that's why the fortune 100 have wrapped themselves
[2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:19.480]  the name of LBGT and African-American rights all the rest of it all over the
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:23.600]  world that's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and
[2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:27.460]  in communist China and many other areas while they undermine our basic
[2:43:27.460 --> 2:43:31.680]  liberties here and spy on us through the big tech the central banks and other
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:37.840]  zone so this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new superclass it's
[2:43:37.840 --> 2:43:42.800]  the politicians it's the corporate media it's the police it's the bureaucrats it's
[2:43:42.800 --> 2:43:45.800]  members of Congress and their staff and their families it's the White House
[2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:52.400]  hell it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but not the
[2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:56.040]  general public and everybody else through corporate rule so this is the true
[2:43:56.040 --> 2:44:00.760]  discrimination that's going on I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28
[2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:05.600]  years against the globalist I wanted to stop their agenda I wanted to wake up
[2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:10.400]  the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational but
[2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:14.600]  we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flat-footed
[2:44:14.600 --> 2:44:20.120]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great
[2:44:20.120 --> 2:44:23.960]  reset and that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:27.880]  listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to
[2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:31.480]  wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information warfare the
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:35.440]  enemy and try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared and
[2:44:35.440 --> 2:44:38.280]  one of the number one things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:42.840]  best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com so

[2:44:51.520 --> 2:44:55.640]  there are long lines and waits because believe me serious times are coming get
[2:44:55.640 --> 2:45:01.800]  ready at infowarstore.com it is through our five senses that we are kept
[2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:06.800]  fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see through
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:11.920]  this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big
[2:45:11.920 --> 2:45:16.440]  problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the
[2:45:16.440 --> 2:45:21.240]  pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have
[2:45:21.240 --> 2:45:25.480]  been known for millennia the hindu chakras aligned with the endocrine system
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:30.720]  the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described as the
[2:45:30.720 --> 2:45:35.040]  seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:40.440]  consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:45:45.920]  is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:50.920]  with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:55.840]  proprio showerhead will seal the deal get them both today for yourself or a
[2:45:55.840 --> 2:46:01.960]  friend at infowarstore.com so if you understand that this is not FDA approved
[2:46:01.960 --> 2:46:08.880]  it's totally experimental it's never been given to human beings before some of
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:14.400]  the ingredients inside of these of these shots have never been injected in human
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:19.480]  beings before there are no long-term studies we don't know what's going to
[2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:23.920]  happen inside your body somewhere four to six weeks after your second injection
[2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:30.720]  or four to six months or even two years we have no idea whether it's gonna cause
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:35.400]  infertility whether it's gonna cause cancer how bad your autoimmune disease
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:39.040]  is going to be my conclusion after looking at this for a long time and
[2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:42.520]  listening to the arguments for these masks I determined that if you believe
[2:46:42.520 --> 2:46:46.880]  if you're a medical doctor or a scientist that the spouting using these
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:51.160]  masks you're either being played or you're being paid secure your copy of
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:55.480]  covenland today at covenland.com if you order by October 6th you get a free
[2:46:55.480 --> 2:46:59.560]  copy of in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:06.080]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:47:06.080 --> 2:47:17.840]  and so Budez and I nebulized will help with early disease it'll also help with
[2:47:17.840 --> 2:47:22.400]  late disease proven and randomized controlled trials this is science also
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:28.320]  aspirin makes sense because as I said they're seeing veno-thromboemboly pulmonary
[2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:33.280]  emboli or heart attacks or strokes as a result of the thromboxane one of the
[2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:38.200]  cytokines released from the lung lining and so if you can use a medicine that
[2:47:38.200 --> 2:47:41.800]  will shut down the release of thromboxane and the other cytokines that
[2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:48.080]  makes sense and that's Budez and I'd also the antibiotic I use chlorethromycin
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:53.280]  86% coverage of strep pneumonia as opposed to a zithromycin a Z-PAC that has
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:58.680]  78% coverage of strep pneumonia the bacteria that's encapsulated they
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:03.360]  cause is bacterial pneumonia that's why I use that antibiotic but we also have
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:08.000]  Regeneron monoclonal antibodies that decrease the risk the risk of
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:14.120]  hospitalization or deaths from COVID by 70% with a 30-minute infusion and so we
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:18.440]  have many tools and they should all be employed if someone has COVID they
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:22.760]  should not try to tough it out at home this is a dangerous as far as I'm
[2:48:22.760 --> 2:48:27.720]  concerned my perspective it's a bio weapon and that we are in germ warfare
[2:48:27.720 --> 2:48:32.280]  just like we've had cyber war which has been talked about for several years now
[2:48:32.280 --> 2:48:38.160]  and we've talked about and it's been public knowledge that there have been
[2:48:38.160 --> 2:48:43.000]  enemy states that have been trying to hack our power grid and other things we
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:47.320]  know that this is going on why is this such a surprise probably because of
[2:48:47.320 --> 2:48:51.960]  normalcy bias but people need to educate themselves and prepare themselves for
[2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:55.520]  there to help themselves and their neighbors roll up your sleeves for the
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:49:00.440]  right reason to do what you can where you are local action can affect the
[2:49:00.440 --> 2:49:06.320]  nation in a positive way and so do what you can educate yourself there's a lot
[2:49:06.320 --> 2:49:11.600]  of information hours of information at view that's nine works calm a third
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:16.760]  party site it's not mine and also there is a providers tab where you can find
[2:49:16.760 --> 2:49:20.960]  providers that will use effective early outpatient therapies there in many
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:28.200]  states and also that synergy health DPC is not not mine it's not owned or
[2:49:28.200 --> 2:49:32.840]  operated by me it's a telemedicine service that is using my protocol and is
[2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:38.800]  saving lives and so I want to I want to equip people I'm trying to help people
[2:49:38.800 --> 2:49:42.480]  anyway I can that's why we're doing this interview right now and Alex I
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:47.560]  appreciate your being such a gracious host I appreciate the information that
[2:49:47.560 --> 2:49:53.560]  you've put out for years that has been spot on and at times so because you were
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:57.400]  ahead of the curve people might have mocked you but hey who's mocking you
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:50:01.960]  now that all these things have been proven and so thank you for the time
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:08.320]  we're not helpless we're not hopeless our our hope is in God this is one
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:14.080]  nation under God and Jesus did pay the price for us for all our needs to be
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:20.440]  met he does answer prayer the strategy that I got a year ago was the result of
[2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:25.000]  a prayer praying for patients when I was in the emergency room God what will I do
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:28.240]  if someone comes in here and they're dying of COVID and they tell me I can't
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:33.640]  breathe and during that 48 48 hour shift in the emergency room I had a moment
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:38.000]  where I could go take a catnap in the call room and this was an answer to
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:44.200]  prayer during that dream when I was waking up and so who would have thought
[2:50:44.200 --> 2:50:49.840]  that God would answer a prayer was something that's so practical so
[2:50:49.840 --> 2:50:55.600]  relevant to our life right now that was proven later to be validated by Oxford
[2:50:55.600 --> 2:51:02.880]  University as 90% effective so you just said I just came to your mind no I was
[2:51:02.880 --> 2:51:09.240]  I was yes immediately I had all of this it was like a download all at once as I
[2:51:09.240 --> 2:51:16.680]  was waking up I knew what to do I knew why to do it and and I had no one to
[2:51:16.680 --> 2:51:19.920]  tell because I was the only one in the call room and five days later I had my
[2:51:19.920 --> 2:51:24.600]  first patients Alex with COVID and it worked and they should have died according
[2:51:24.600 --> 2:51:28.720]  to everything that was in the news and we were seeing that everybody was dying
[2:51:28.720 --> 2:51:32.120]  if they were overweight if they had diabetes if they had asthma and these
[2:51:32.120 --> 2:51:36.680]  patients had both had all of that and they lived and then I saw I had a
[2:51:36.680 --> 2:51:41.840]  patient who had two forms of lymphoma on chemotherapy had radiation a month
[2:51:41.840 --> 2:51:47.760]  before and again the strategy worked quickly and then I had another fellow
[2:51:47.760 --> 2:51:54.440]  who had stage four prostate cancer and he's on chemo and he beat COVID with
[2:51:54.440 --> 2:52:00.160]  this protocol but eight most later succumbed to the cancer and so I have
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:05.720]  seen overwhelming evidence that this that we have effective outpatient and
[2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:11.040]  expensive strategies that will help save lives and I want everyone to have
[2:52:11.040 --> 2:52:15.400]  access to that and that's why I have dropped everything for the last three
[2:52:15.400 --> 2:52:21.520]  weeks to totally be immersed with COVID patients in a Regeneron monoclonal
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:26.760]  antibody infusion center in West Texas where I am on purpose going into a
[2:52:26.760 --> 2:52:31.400]  building for 11-hour days to solely be around people who are infectious with
[2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:36.080]  COVID so I can help save their life and there are other heroes that are on the
[2:52:36.080 --> 2:52:41.520]  team with me and I'm honored to work with them and I appreciate I appreciate
[2:52:41.520 --> 2:52:47.640]  Governor DeSantis, thank you Governor DeSantis I'd love to meet you
[2:52:47.640 --> 2:52:52.080]  someday thank you Rand Paul I'd love to meet you someday and shake your hand
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:57.280]  we have some real heroes that have pushed this strategy Governor Abbott's
[2:52:57.280 --> 2:53:01.440]  got a lot better than where he was a year ago and I and I got to say kudos to
[2:53:01.440 --> 2:53:06.880]  Governor Abbott for for pushing this board with the Texas division of
[2:53:06.880 --> 2:53:12.120]  emergency management so this is kudos to Governor Abbott he's doing the right
[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:15.840]  thing right now and I appreciate what you're doing Governor and let me just
[2:53:15.840 --> 2:53:18.360]  get this in before we go because you are a hero you don't want that it's your
[2:53:18.360 --> 2:53:21.720]  instinct your spirit you're doing it I've seen this you know my dad and other
[2:53:21.720 --> 2:53:24.960]  great physicians and that's what great doctors are so people really respect
[2:53:24.960 --> 2:53:28.400]  doctors and evil corporations and sinister political groups try to steal
[2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:33.360]  your identity and then say they're the doctor with Fauci up there but I know
[2:53:33.360 --> 2:53:37.280]  that I gave your number out and hundreds of people called you and then you put
[2:53:37.280 --> 2:53:39.760]  them in contact with people and stuff and I know that they gave it out so it
[2:53:39.760 --> 2:53:42.760]  became an insane thing I knew that with everybody else I know you were work I
[2:53:42.760 --> 2:53:45.480]  mean I would like call you at midnight you'd call back so I we really
[2:53:45.480 --> 2:53:49.280]  appreciate you and we love what you've done and I know my dad looked like he was
[2:53:49.280 --> 2:53:53.920]  dead he was done like 83% oxygen we got the thing got him you've got the
[2:53:53.920 --> 2:53:57.880]  doctors you recommended got it all to him within five six hours the next
[2:53:57.880 --> 2:54:00.960]  morning come over there he's putting together a stuff that had come to the
[2:54:00.960 --> 2:54:05.480]  house again those those deck chairs just amazing and I saw that and I've seen
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:09.480]  what's happened and it's just an amazing thing so thank you so much for
[2:54:09.480 --> 2:54:12.760]  spending time with us you never put out a website you're just recommending people
[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:15.720]  that are helping folks how do people because you know these interviews are
[2:54:15.720 --> 2:54:19.520]  important as well how do people get in touch with you via email I know a lot
[2:54:19.520 --> 2:54:22.920]  of folks who watch this if other talk shows or other stuff won't get you on
[2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:25.680]  because I know that's another way to warn people I don't give you more work to do
[2:54:25.680 --> 2:54:29.760]  but how do people get in touch with you do you have a website or are you gonna
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:33.920]  write a book or something I've written a couple books about what I've seen in
[2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:39.600]  other countries on medical mission trips but I'm a messenger and Alex let
[2:54:39.600 --> 2:54:47.640]  them contact you and you got my number and if they're following you then then
[2:54:47.640 --> 2:54:53.880]  let them contact you because you've been bringing useful information for decades
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:57.120]  now and I have great respect for you well we appreciate you doctor thanks for
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:00.480]  saving my dad and so many others Dr. Richard Bartlett he recommends we
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:05.400]  that's an ironworks calm and synergy health DPC calm for folks and I would I'm
[2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:08.680]  not gonna tell you what to do I'm not a doctor but I think it's important if this
[2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:12.840]  place gives it out or they can I mean is it okay to pre-stock policies these
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:16.400]  aren't like controlled things at a high level are they or do you wait till you
[2:55:16.400 --> 2:55:19.920]  get the first symptoms or I mean I know they'll get at you for this but is there
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:23.280]  30 seconds or a minute on this is there anything we should do preemptively what
[2:55:23.280 --> 2:55:29.080]  vitamin D zinc C just 60 seconds on that doc what would you do preemptively to
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:34.520]  try to dodge a bullet on this so there are several things that I think are
[2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:41.000]  winning strategies and we have some of that print at you desanideworks.com it
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:49.760]  talks about prevention we talk about science a university over in the in the
[2:55:49.760 --> 2:55:54.760]  UK showed that mouthwash for 30 seconds kills the virus is trying to multiply the
[2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:57.840]  virus comes in through the nose and throat and eyes we've done that from the
[2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:01.800]  beginning and so it's trying to multiply in the upper respiratory tract that the
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:08.160]  or from the throat to the mouth to the nose the nasal pharynx for the first
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:11.880]  three to five days so if you use mouthwash that's a good strategy I want
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:17.440]  to mention one more tool that we didn't talk about there is a company that has a
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:24.720]  website called h2bev.com h2bev short for beverage.com they have a product
[2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:30.240]  called hydro shot which will release which has evidence that it will increase
[2:56:30.240 --> 2:56:36.080]  nitric oxide in your bloodstream for 10 hours and what that does is it will help
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:41.320]  with oxygenation and it helps remove the brain fog it helps with energy and this
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:46.120]  is a game changer as well for helping people recover from COVID people that
[2:56:46.120 --> 2:56:50.720]  might have long hauler syndrome after they've recovered this is a very safe and
[2:56:50.720 --> 2:56:54.120]  effective tool that I have found it's over the counter you can only order it
[2:56:54.120 --> 2:57:00.720]  from h2bev.com they have another product called silver bullet that has zinc and
[2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:06.480]  eGCGs from green tea and it's hydrogen infused drink and that will that's a
[2:57:06.480 --> 2:57:11.640]  preventive measure we've talked about cursitan with zinc we talked about we've
[2:57:11.640 --> 2:57:18.680]  talked about hydroxychloroquine with zinc well this is eGCGs totally safe to
[2:57:18.680 --> 2:57:24.560]  drink eGCGs from green tea and that is a Iona for that will also get zinc into
[2:57:24.560 --> 2:57:30.080]  cells I got to give credit to Dr. Zelinko for making me aware of all of
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:35.600]  those he's a great guy he was on Friday all right Dr. Richard Bartlett get some
[2:57:35.600 --> 2:57:40.840]  well deserve rest here on this weekend evening thank you so much again God

[2:58:48.080 --> 2:58:53.440]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart even my soul I've ever had
[2:58:53.440 --> 2:59:00.120]  in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of lost everybody else has and it's
[2:59:00.120 --> 2:59:09.080]  because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[2:59:09.080 --> 2:59:16.920]  and bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away and I see the
[2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:21.040]  general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral
[2:59:21.040 --> 2:59:27.120]  psychologically controlled trans and I know we're being fed into this
[2:59:27.120 --> 2:59:33.480]  bloodless me grounded it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and
[2:59:33.480 --> 2:59:37.880]  then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then
[2:59:37.880 --> 2:59:42.880]  coming back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer
[2:59:42.880 --> 2:59:47.120]  and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species
[2:59:47.120 --> 2:59:49.600]  as we know it
[2:59:49.600 --> 2:59:56.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:56.760 --> 2:59:58.760]  you
[2:59:58.760 --> 3:00:26.360]  you from the summit dot news studios in the United Kingdom you're listening to
[3:00:26.360 --> 3:00:37.600]  all Joseph Watson real live is the summit news hour for this 28 of September 2021
[3:00:37.600 --> 3:00:42.160]  got a huge raft of news coming up over the course of the next hour including a
[3:00:42.160 --> 3:00:47.720]  powerful video in the final segment where we take the Pope to task on his
[3:00:47.720 --> 3:00:51.920]  pronouncement that his critics are performing the work of the devil by
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:56.840]  criticizing him criticizing him for all his edicts his position on global
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:01:02.000]  government man-made climate change the migrant crisis vaccine passports in
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:07.920]  Italy but anyone who wants to enter the Vatican literally promoting amplifying
[3:01:07.920 --> 3:01:12.560]  the mark of the beast in revelations not very christian we're gonna get into
[3:01:12.560 --> 3:01:17.240]  that in the final segment of the show we're also gonna get into how Sweden is
[3:01:17.240 --> 3:01:21.440]  continuing to experience the wonderful joyous benefits of multiculturalism
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:25.600]  with a huge apartment explosion which the authorities have already come out and
[3:01:25.600 --> 3:01:31.000]  said is not a gas leak it's not a gas explosion it looks like another
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:36.640]  migrant crime gang linked attack specifically on a police officer that
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:42.640]  was trying to derail the migrant gangs in that area of Gothenburg gonna get into
[3:01:42.640 --> 3:01:47.360]  the situation in the United Kingdom in a similar context with Breitbart reporting
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:51.840]  twice as many illegal boat migrants land in Britain this year than all of 2020
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:56.240]  they continue to come in they don't need coronavirus PCR tests when they come
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:02:01.160]  into the country Brits who want to leave the country to go on holiday need to
[3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:06.840]  undergo that onerous coronavirus testing system you can also tell you where
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:11.520]  they're putting up these migrants again it's in three four-star hotels literally
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:16.440]  the taxpayer is paying for them already over a hundred and fifty migrants have
[3:02:16.440 --> 3:02:24.880]  been ensconced in a hotel in one town in Britain alone from Afghanistan meanwhile
[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:28.720]  the British government is trying to bypass Parliament to implement vaccine
[3:02:28.720 --> 3:02:32.720]  passports of course at first they said they would never even consider such a
[3:02:32.720 --> 3:02:36.400]  move even as the rest of the world was doing it under the world economic
[3:02:36.400 --> 3:02:40.840]  forums great reset then they came back and said yes we're going to implement
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:44.360]  them and there was a revolt in Parliament then they said we're not gonna
[3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:48.200]  implement them the day after that they said yes we're gonna implement them by
[3:02:48.200 --> 3:02:53.360]  the end of September well now it's back on the agenda again and they're trying
[3:02:53.360 --> 3:02:57.720]  to bypass a parliamentary vote because they're not gonna get it through big
[3:02:57.720 --> 3:03:02.960]  revolt in Australia continues of course we've had the massive unruly protests in
[3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:07.040]  Melbourne against the mandatory vaccinations the government responded
[3:03:07.040 --> 3:03:10.960]  by shutting down the construction industry for two weeks that caused more
[3:03:10.960 --> 3:03:15.560]  protests more police brutality with police now even visiting people's
[3:03:15.560 --> 3:03:20.440]  houses if they think they're considering planning going to a protest through
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:24.760]  their social media activity absolute pure bread tyranny happening in
[3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:30.640]  Australia still but some form of revolt now with the police commissioner in New
[3:03:30.640 --> 3:03:34.920]  South Wales saying that they're gonna refuse to enforce a vaccine passport
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:41.760]  mandate in clubs restaurants bars and other venues we have 95% vaccination
[3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:45.600]  rate at Harvard and despite that they're experiencing a substantial outbreak of
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:50.400]  COVID the vaccines are pathetic ineffective they don't work we have two
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:54.320]  NBA stars who have come out very publicly over the past 24 hours and
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:03:59.560]  addressed their stance on refusing to take mandatory COVID-19 shots we're
[3:03:59.560 --> 3:04:05.480]  gonna play those clips gonna talk about Joe Biden saying that 97 to 98% of
[3:04:05.480 --> 3:04:10.440]  Americans must be vaxxed before life gets back to normal of course that's a
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:14.280]  completely impossible target and it's meant to be an impossible target because
[3:04:14.280 --> 3:04:18.840]  they never want life to get back to normal that ties in with what the CEO of
[3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:23.000]  Pfizer said yesterday which was that normal life won't return without regular
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:28.400]  COVID booster shots if you haven't had your ninth COVID booster shot you won't
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:33.800]  be able to buy food in the supermarket that's the ultimate plan the CEO of
[3:04:33.800 --> 3:04:37.680]  Moderna has come out with similar comments so we're gonna get into that
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:43.720]  inside footage from again project Veritas from Johnson and Johnson an
[3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:47.600]  official says children shouldn't get the vaxx due to unknown repercussions he
[3:04:47.600 --> 3:04:52.160]  advised other people not to take the vaccine from inside Johnson and Johnson
[3:04:52.160 --> 3:04:58.760]  gonna get into all that on what and more on the other side summit.news.go
[3:04:58.760 --> 3:05:02.680]  and in addition we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary
[3:05:02.680 --> 3:05:06.720]  systems of these employees because when you cover the mouth and nose and you
[3:05:06.720 --> 3:05:10.880]  exert physical energy during your work during your tasks whatever it might be
[3:05:10.880 --> 3:05:14.320]  you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system because you change
[3:05:14.320 --> 3:05:18.960]  the way that you breathe you have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale that
[3:05:18.960 --> 3:05:23.760]  taxes the heart it taxes the lungs and we have given people heart attacks by
[3:05:23.760 --> 3:05:28.560]  allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no
[3:05:28.560 --> 3:05:34.440]  regulation no oversight no medical oversight. the globalists have told us
[3:05:34.440 --> 3:05:37.960]  we're a disease they've told us they want to eradicate us and all the studies
[3:05:37.960 --> 3:05:41.600]  show that when you wear these masks it lowers your oxygen level up to one
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:46.880]  third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning this is a sick
[3:05:46.880 --> 3:05:50.560]  cult and we've got to say no but the only way the real science because out of
[3:05:50.560 --> 3:05:55.760]  the public is if we tell them get your copy today of COVID land and expose them
[3:05:55.760 --> 3:05:59.680]  it's covidland.com go there now.
[3:06:00.520 --> 3:06:08.600]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:15.200]  and we are live and as I mentioned before the break Sweden has continued to
[3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:19.880]  experience the wonderful joyous benefits of diversity which we continue to be
[3:06:19.880 --> 3:06:24.200]  told is a strength despite the fact that all available evidence proves otherwise
[3:06:24.200 --> 3:06:27.920]  academic studies which I'm going to talk about prove otherwise we've had
[3:06:27.920 --> 3:06:32.600]  another example of that in Gothenburg Sweden today. remember when Trump back
[3:06:32.600 --> 3:06:38.960]  in 2017 was bashed from pillar to post by the media for talking about quote last
[3:06:38.960 --> 3:06:42.560]  night in Sweden talking about the massive problems with migrant crime that
[3:06:42.560 --> 3:06:48.000]  they've had for over a decade now and that they continue to have after the
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:52.560]  mass invasion that we had in 2015 when numerous European countries open
[3:06:52.560 --> 3:06:57.360]  their borders to over a million migrants. well this is from today huge
[3:06:57.360 --> 3:07:02.200]  Sweden apartment blast likely caused by explosive device say authorities a
[3:07:02.200 --> 3:07:06.040]  powerful blast that ripped through an apartment block in Gothenburg was
[3:07:06.040 --> 3:07:09.280]  likely caused by an explosive device raising the prospect of another gang
[3:07:09.280 --> 3:07:15.120]  linked attack in multicultural Sweden. it happened in the Anadol district in
[3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:21.120]  central Gothenburg this morning starting a major fire. this was a huge blast they
[3:07:21.120 --> 3:07:24.600]  have a lot of these grenade attacks where these gang members just throw
[3:07:24.600 --> 3:07:29.840]  grenades at each other and it causes minor blasts. this was a big one this was
[3:07:29.840 --> 3:07:35.400]  more than just a grenade up to 25 people sustained injuries. there are four
[3:07:35.400 --> 3:07:40.440]  people hospitalized in serious condition. police spokesman Thomas Fokbor say
[3:07:40.440 --> 3:07:44.200]  confirmed that the working premises that an explosive device was deliberately
[3:07:44.200 --> 3:07:49.680]  planted. at first there were suggestions that it was just a gas explosion but they
[3:07:49.680 --> 3:07:55.760]  noted that there was no gas pipeline in the immediate area. RT reports the
[3:07:55.760 --> 3:08:00.440]  explosion rocked through the building just before 5 a.m. local time damaging
[3:08:00.440 --> 3:08:04.600]  three stairwells some residents use tide sheets to escape from their homes through
[3:08:04.600 --> 3:08:09.400]  windows as the fire ignited by the blast spread and sent thick plumes of grey
[3:08:09.400 --> 3:08:16.200]  smoke. in the air the smell of diversity was hanging for everybody to inhale.
[3:08:16.200 --> 3:08:23.440]  again 25 people injured for an hospital. Henrik Palmgren tweeted about the
[3:08:23.440 --> 3:08:27.240]  explosion he said massive explosion bomb has gone off in an apartment complex in
[3:08:27.240 --> 3:08:33.880]  Gothenburg Sweden. 99.9% chance this is diversity then he went on to say some
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:39.440]  sources claim that a Swedish police chief who worked on criminal immigrant
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:43.160]  gangs lived in one of the apartments in this complex and he was the most likely
[3:08:43.160 --> 3:08:50.240]  target again 5 a.m. making sure everyone's home to get as big a casualty
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:55.360]  count as possible. an investigation earlier this year found that Sweden had
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:08:59.680]  gone from being one of the safest European countries 20 years ago in terms
[3:08:59.680 --> 3:09:05.200]  of gun crime to the second most dangerous with most of the shootings linked
[3:09:05.200 --> 3:09:09.200]  to these criminal migrant gangs that they've imported over the past 10 20
[3:09:09.200 --> 3:09:16.400]  years in the name of diversity studies show that by 2050 Swedes as a
[3:09:16.400 --> 3:09:20.880]  percentage of the native population will be outnumbered by these migrants
[3:09:20.880 --> 3:09:26.000]  they're literally being replaced can't talk about that though can talk about it
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:29.320]  if you say it's a good thing but as soon as you talk about it and say well
[3:09:29.320 --> 3:09:34.120]  maybe replacing the entire native population of a country might have some
[3:09:34.120 --> 3:09:39.160]  negative consequences as Tucker Carlson did recently well then you're a
[3:09:39.160 --> 3:09:44.760]  dangerous extremist radical who is in league with basically domestic
[3:09:44.760 --> 3:09:47.720]  terrorists if you say it's a good thing though it's fine if it's a bad thing
[3:09:47.720 --> 3:09:53.520]  that conspiracy theory doesn't exist and you're a terrorist in 2017 the global
[3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:57.440]  media began attacking president Donald Trump for pointing out Sweden have big
[3:09:57.440 --> 3:10:01.160]  having big problems with migrant crime due to open borders yet Trump has been
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:07.760]  proven right time and time again we had a big report out of Quillett in 2019 which
[3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:10.800]  said the alarming number of grenade attacks and explosions in Sweden
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:16.680]  represented a national emergency remember Tim Poole I think it was went into
[3:10:16.680 --> 3:10:22.160]  Sweden back in 2017 and basically got kicked out of the migrant area got
[3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:26.280]  escorted out by police because he was being attacked it's basically a thought
[3:10:26.280 --> 3:10:30.720]  crime simply to suggest that Sweden is having major problems with soaring
[3:10:30.720 --> 3:10:35.920]  migrant crime even though that's proven to be correct time and time again they
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:40.720]  have massive riots on a regular basis as we've seen in many places cities and
[3:10:40.720 --> 3:10:46.800]  towns in France cars set on fire and we have grenade attacks regular grenade
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:51.880]  attacks and regular explosions not even terrorist attacks just foreign migrant
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:56.760]  gangs fighting each other and innocent people getting caught up in the process
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:11:01.800]  Quillett reported Sweden has experienced a sharp rise in explosions in recent
[3:11:01.800 --> 3:11:07.400]  years predominantly related to conflicts between warring criminal gangs the use
[3:11:07.400 --> 3:11:11.040]  of explosives in the Nordic countries now at a level that is so unique in the
[3:11:11.040 --> 3:11:17.680]  world for a state not at war and that's according to police deadly shootings in
[3:11:17.680 --> 3:11:21.640]  Sweden risen by a factor of 10 in one generation but again you can't talk
[3:11:21.640 --> 3:11:26.560]  about it because there's a code of silence where you can't quench question
[3:11:26.560 --> 3:11:33.760]  the mantra the orthodoxy the sacred dogma that diversity is a strength we
[3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:37.480]  featured before the words of veteran Swedish police investigator Peter
[3:11:37.480 --> 3:11:42.200]  spring air who again was viciously attacked for coming out and telling the
[3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:47.000]  truth he said quote this was back in 2017 when the whole Trump thing was going
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:52.040]  on quote here we go this is the police chief this is what I've handled from
[3:11:52.040 --> 3:11:55.680]  Monday to Friday this week rape rape robbery aggravated assault rape
[3:11:55.680 --> 3:11:58.720]  assault rape extortion blackmail assault violence against police threats the
[3:11:58.720 --> 3:12:02.800]  police drug crime drugs crime felony attempt to murder rape again extortion
[3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:07.360]  again and ill treatment and then he listed the names of the suspected
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:12.800]  perpetrators of all these crimes and see if you can notice a pattern here
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:20.120]  suspects of perpetrators Ali Muhammad Muhammad Muhammad Ali Christopher yes a
[3:12:20.120 --> 3:12:24.200]  Swedish name stuck in on the edges of drug crime he goes on to say Muhammad
[3:12:24.200 --> 3:12:31.280]  Mahmood Ali he then listed the suspects countries of origin Iraq Iran Turkey
[3:12:31.280 --> 3:12:38.720]  Syria Afghanistan Somalia Somalia again Syria again Somalia again so he was
[3:12:38.720 --> 3:12:42.160]  tracking the perpetrators the names their country of origin and again it
[3:12:42.160 --> 3:12:45.960]  proved to be time and time again mainly from the Middle East some from North
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:51.720]  Africa after Sweden flung open its borders to these people because again
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:57.880]  diversity is a strength even though we have this article in 2019 new peer
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:04.280]  reviewed academic study finds diversity whisper it is not a strength turns out
[3:13:04.280 --> 3:13:07.520]  diversity is not a strength at all according to this study from the
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:12.280]  University of Copenhagen they sought to answer whether quote continued
[3:13:12.280 --> 3:13:16.160]  immigration and corresponding growing ethnic diversity was having a positive
[3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:20.640]  impact on community cohesion for the study found the opposite to be the case
[3:13:20.640 --> 3:13:25.960]  they concluded quote we find a statistically significant negative
[3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:32.720]  relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust across all studies went
[3:13:32.720 --> 3:13:35.640]  on to say the higher diversity is significantly associated with lower
[3:13:35.640 --> 3:13:42.720]  trust in communities and higher crime meanwhile in the UK Breitbart reports
[3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:47.720]  twice as many illegal boat migrants land in Britain this year than all of 2020
[3:13:47.720 --> 3:13:52.480]  of course we elected a conservative in name only government on the premise on
[3:13:52.480 --> 3:13:57.040]  the promise that they would take back control of our borders and control
[3:13:57.040 --> 3:14:02.600]  immigration it's worse than ever and it's getting even worse after the fall of
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:07.240]  Afghanistan to the Taliban the crisis in the English Channel has seen double the
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:10.400]  number of illegal boat migrants land in the first nine months of the year as of
[3:14:10.400 --> 3:14:15.640]  the whole of 2020 and again they're flooding in on the boats with another
[3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:22.320]  660 illegal migrants landing on British shores on Sunday on one day alone that
[3:14:22.320 --> 3:14:28.280]  makes it over 17,000 known illegals landing just turning up randomly in
[3:14:28.280 --> 3:14:32.880]  boats on the shores of Britain in many cases just running off into the nearest
[3:14:32.880 --> 3:14:37.000]  town nobody knows who they are none of them have any papers they could be Isis
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:41.920]  Isis bragged about exploiting the refugee wave back in 2015 to carry out
[3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:47.240]  numerous mass casualty terror attacks like the Paris massacre where are these
[3:14:47.240 --> 3:14:52.400]  migrants being housed well the Yorkshire Post reports for the 150 Afghan
[3:14:52.400 --> 3:14:56.000]  refugees to be housed in Scarborough after 92 we give an accommodation in
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:02.440]  hotels so they're putting them up on beachfront hotels in towns in Britain
[3:15:02.440 --> 3:15:07.600]  where the normal price for a room in this instance is from when I last checked
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:11.560]  36 pounds a lot of these rooms are empty now because it's the end of the holiday
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:17.480]  season so the government is playing paying these hotels 250 pounds a pop to
[3:15:17.480 --> 3:15:23.360]  house these migrants in the top two floors of this gigantic hotel of course
[3:15:23.360 --> 3:15:26.600]  the hotel's happy about it because the rooms are either gonna be empty or
[3:15:26.600 --> 3:15:30.680]  they're only gonna be getting 36 pounds for them they get in 250 pounds a pop
[3:15:30.680 --> 3:15:35.240]  the problem with that we reason why that price is so high and it's all tax payer
[3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:40.000]  funded is because these migrants are crapping everywhere they're trashing the
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:46.960]  hotel rooms there are inter migrant wars migrant gang attacks surrounding all of
[3:15:46.960 --> 3:15:53.040]  these hotels it's absolute bedlam but this is the wonderful diversity that we

[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:07.960]  Joe Biden's declaration of war against America on Thursday September 9 2021 was
[3:19:07.960 --> 3:19:12.040]  that the announcement of force inoculations of 80 to 100 million
[3:19:12.040 --> 3:19:16.280]  Americans wasn't the announcement of federalization of all the major cities

[3:19:21.440 --> 3:19:26.720]  wasn't that was all bad enough it's the fact that he's following a U.N. globalist
[3:19:26.720 --> 3:19:31.520]  great recent blueprint that Australia the UK Europe and the rest of Western

[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:23.840]  Paul Joseph Watson because we have the new South Wales health chief come out a
[3:20:23.840 --> 3:20:28.200]  couple of days ago basically tell Australians even if you continue to get
[3:20:28.200 --> 3:20:31.880]  the booster shots the COVID-19 vaccines they're still going to keep some of the
[3:20:31.880 --> 3:20:37.080]  restrictions in place we've had the construction workers protesting
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:41.880]  vociferously over the past week after the government punished them for
[3:20:41.880 --> 3:20:46.120]  basically refusing to take the mandatory shot which they union demanded they do
[3:20:46.120 --> 3:20:52.120]  those protests continue in Melbourne we've also got news out of Australia which
[3:20:52.120 --> 3:20:55.560]  is actually good news today but I'm going to get into this on the other side
[3:20:55.560 --> 3:21:00.920]  because the prison island of Australia is keeping its inmates in check by having
[3:21:00.920 --> 3:21:06.800]  the police conduct home visits to people that they suspect may be planning
[3:21:06.800 --> 3:21:10.800]  protests of course we saw the footage back about six months ago now with them
[3:21:10.800 --> 3:21:15.400]  arresting a pregnant woman in her own home for merely planning and even
[3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:20.280]  planning protesting planning a protest posting about a protest on Facebook
[3:21:20.280 --> 3:21:24.560]  people are being threatened with eleven thousand dollar fines for showing up at
[3:21:24.560 --> 3:21:28.760]  a protest you've seen the absolute bedlam which is the police brutality
[3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:33.080]  meted out against people who simply stand in the street not wearing a mask
[3:21:33.080 --> 3:21:38.240]  well now they're literally paying paying people home visits if they suspect them
[3:21:38.240 --> 3:21:42.840]  of planning on attending a protest we got that clip here it is
[3:21:42.840 --> 3:21:46.920]  prison island of Australia is now keeping its inmates in check by having
[3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:52.800]  thought police pay home visits to people who they suspect might be planning to
[3:21:52.800 --> 3:21:57.560]  attend a protest attend a protest oh my god the absolute horror
[3:21:57.560 --> 3:22:02.240]  what we're here for is obviously just in relation to the recent protests that are popping up and going on
[3:22:02.240 --> 3:22:05.960]  just see to do welfare checks and what not you're planning on going in
[3:22:05.960 --> 3:22:11.080]  I didn't know there's anything going on no any planned protests that you may know of
[3:22:11.080 --> 3:22:13.960]  not as far as I know
[3:22:13.960 --> 3:22:17.560]  it's a good place to price when the cops are here
[3:22:17.560 --> 3:22:20.600]  just a friendly chat that's all
[3:22:20.600 --> 3:22:24.760]  just a friendly chat because it's perfectly normal in a free country to
[3:22:24.760 --> 3:22:28.640]  have three cops show up on your doorstep because they think you might be
[3:22:28.640 --> 3:22:32.600]  thinking about criticising the government totally not like North
[3:22:32.600 --> 3:22:36.680]  Korea or anything so are you aware of any planned protests or events no they're
[3:22:36.680 --> 3:22:41.120]  coming up just no no okay you are any communications circling around between
[3:22:41.120 --> 3:22:46.800]  people about the plan pro any protest coming up no no do you use any platform
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:51.760]  at all or to communicate no so now it's not even if you're going to a protest
[3:22:51.760 --> 3:22:56.600]  it's whether you dared think about mentioning one on social media have you
[3:22:56.600 --> 3:23:03.560]  got any protest in the past no you guys wouldn't be here otherwise
[3:23:03.560 --> 3:23:07.640]  alright I'd like to know how you got this address actually okay
[3:23:07.640 --> 3:23:12.840]  anything else you like to tell us I might help ensure the public safety they're
[3:23:12.840 --> 3:23:17.520]  just keeping people safe like when they pepper spray old women in the face or
[3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:21.720]  fire rubber bullets at protesters it's for your safety for you guys outrun
[3:23:21.720 --> 3:23:24.200]  around shouldn't people with rubber bullets like down in Victoria we're all
[3:23:24.200 --> 3:23:27.160]  good
[3:23:27.160 --> 3:23:30.040]  like they're concerned with what's happening down in Victoria that it doesn't
[3:23:30.040 --> 3:23:36.520]  manipulate you know just making sure your safety our safety everyone's so
[3:23:36.520 --> 3:23:41.760]  safe so long as the thought police ensure everyone stays home and doesn't
[3:23:41.760 --> 3:23:47.560]  even dare to think about talking about a protest everyone's going to be so safe
[3:23:47.560 --> 3:23:51.720]  don't start up a conversation don't forget they actually pass legislation
[3:23:51.720 --> 3:23:56.240]  where people who even post about protests on social media can face fines of
[3:23:56.240 --> 3:24:01.280]  up to eleven thousand dollars they send cops around to the homes of pregnant
[3:24:01.280 --> 3:24:05.600]  women and arrest them in front of their kids if they dared talk about a protest
[3:24:05.600 --> 3:24:10.600]  on Facebook Australia has fallen it can no longer claim to be a democratic
[3:24:10.600 --> 3:24:14.840]  country and this should be an international outrage meanwhile Jack
[3:24:14.840 --> 3:24:18.560]  booted thugs doled out more police brutality to construction workers
[3:24:18.560 --> 3:24:21.680]  demonstrating in Melbourne and if I showed you what they did this video
[3:24:21.680 --> 3:24:25.280]  would get age restricted or banned so check it out in the description below
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:30.240]  and don't forget to hit the subscribe button for regular updates
[3:24:34.600 --> 3:24:39.320]  Australian thought police visiting people's homes is actually some good news
[3:24:39.320 --> 3:24:45.160]  out of Australia today finally we have a headline here out of summit news
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:51.320]  Australian police commissioner refuses to enforce vaccine passport mandate the
[3:24:51.320 --> 3:24:56.040]  revolt is actually happening it seems at least in one area of Australia New
[3:24:56.040 --> 3:25:00.160]  South Wales where the police commissioner has refused to enforce the
[3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:03.480]  state's vaccine passport mandate revealing the officers will not be
[3:25:03.480 --> 3:25:08.440]  checking people's vaccination status in restaurants clubs or bars remember we
[3:25:08.440 --> 3:25:13.080]  had a similar similar situation in France where during the first few days of
[3:25:13.080 --> 3:25:18.080]  this vaccine passport scheme the photo ops the video show police going from
[3:25:18.080 --> 3:25:24.120]  bar to bar from cafe to cafe demanding to see people's medical papers papers
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:28.720]  please but then afterwards they stopped enforcing it entirely after the
[3:25:28.720 --> 3:25:32.280]  French guy out on the streets and start having picnics on the streets in
[3:25:32.280 --> 3:25:37.280]  protest well as the government in Australia is preparing to pass a mandate
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:44.080]  that will ban all and vaccinated people those disease-ridden oaths from gaining
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:47.760]  entry to numerous venues up until at least December 1st in a repeat of the
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:51.960]  segregation scheme that's being adopted in numerous Western countries but New
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:55.080]  South Wales police commissioner Mick Fuller said it was clear that his
[3:25:55.080 --> 3:25:59.760]  officers wouldn't be on patrol he said quote the role of police in terms of
[3:25:59.760 --> 3:26:03.840]  vaccine passports we will not be walking through restaurants cafes and pubs
[3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:08.280]  checking if people are double vaccinated which contradicts what the
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:11.840]  health minister in that country said Brad hazard who asserted it would be the
[3:26:11.840 --> 3:26:15.120]  police's job to enforce the measures but that doesn't look like it's going to
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:19.320]  happen so they're not going to get it done in Australia because the government's
[3:26:19.320 --> 3:26:22.920]  expecting the police to do it the businesses there are saying they don't
[3:26:22.920 --> 3:26:27.600]  have the resources or the wherewithal to do it in fact unlike in France and
[3:26:27.600 --> 3:26:31.920]  other countries the businesses won't face fines if they allow those dirty
[3:26:31.920 --> 3:26:36.880]  filthy unvaccinated people through the door so it seems like a pointless
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:43.840]  exercise so some final you know green growth shoots of rebellion happening in
[3:26:43.840 --> 3:26:47.400]  Australia meanwhile we see a similar situation in Israel
[3:26:47.400 --> 3:26:51.400]  Israelis rise up against vaccine passports after being told more shots
[3:26:51.400 --> 3:26:55.440]  needed to be considered fully vaccinated remember this is in a country where the
[3:26:55.440 --> 3:27:00.800]  Pfizer vaccine has gone down to a efficacy of about 37% and that was
[3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:05.080]  weeks ago it's probably even lower now they rolled out the vaccine passports
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:08.440]  they rolled out the vaccines one of the most covered countries in terms of
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:14.520]  vaccinations in the world then they had a massive spike in COVID cases because
[3:27:14.520 --> 3:27:19.480]  the vaccines don't work properly well protests have finally erupted in Israel
[3:27:19.480 --> 3:27:23.040]  as it slowly dawned on people that the goalposts for vaccine passports keep
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:27.080]  being shifted by the government over the weekend the newest mark marches that
[3:27:27.080 --> 3:27:31.720]  took place in the streets of Tel Aviv against the so-called green pass so
[3:27:31.720 --> 3:27:37.360]  they're rising up the Italians continue to process we saw a video yesterday of
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:42.440]  the police in Italy removing their helmets in solidarity with the
[3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:47.680]  anti-mandatory VAX protesters this of course was after we had this headline
[3:27:47.680 --> 3:27:52.480]  Italy orders companies not to pay unvaccinated workers they're trying to
[3:27:52.480 --> 3:27:56.840]  get around the fact that these employees are gonna sue the businesses they're
[3:27:56.840 --> 3:28:01.120]  gonna try and sue the government by simply telling the businesses not to
[3:28:01.120 --> 3:28:05.240]  fire the employees but just to not pay them if they don't show up for work they
[3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:09.240]  can't show up for work they're not allowed in because they haven't had the
[3:28:09.240 --> 3:28:13.480]  mandatory vaccine meanwhile the British government is trying to bypass
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:17.880]  parliament to implement vaccine passports again they're doing it through a
[3:28:17.880 --> 3:28:23.120]  public consultation and saying that it's gonna be their plan B it's probably not
[3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:27.840]  gonna happen don't worry unless they get a convenient rising COVID cases over the
[3:28:27.840 --> 3:28:32.240]  winter and of course they lied about it said it had been completely scrapped the
[3:28:32.240 --> 3:28:36.640]  very next day came out and said it would be a quote first-line defense against a
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:41.200]  winter wave of COVID I'm sure they'll be able to accomplish that by meddling with
[3:28:41.200 --> 3:28:45.640]  the numbers as we've seen in the past but again they're launching a public
[3:28:45.640 --> 3:28:49.600]  consultation in an attempt to enlist support for the scheme because they
[3:28:49.600 --> 3:28:53.480]  know they don't have the votes to get it through parliament constitutionally and
[3:28:53.480 --> 3:28:59.080]  legally some of our news will be back no going you know listeners call into the
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:04.520]  show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I
[3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:09.840]  beg you for support constantly for prayer for financial support there for word of
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:13.640]  mouth and then we're all this together and I you know it gets old having to
[3:29:13.640 --> 3:29:16.480]  come to you and say hey I got great products please bomb or we won't be here
[3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:20.000]  on air but it's true for the only media organization in the United States that
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:27.360]  and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else they crippled all the
[3:29:27.360 --> 3:29:31.480]  other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out the
[3:29:31.480 --> 3:29:35.200]  open our credibility is going up that's why we've got to be taken off there
[3:29:35.200 --> 3:29:38.120]  that's why America we've got to be taken down you can't have all these other

[3:33:01.600 --> 3:33:12.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:12.960 --> 3:33:23.080]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:27.680]  So as the revolt continues against mandatory vaccinations and lockdown restrictions in
[3:33:27.680 --> 3:33:32.640]  countries like Australia and Italy, we have a situation in America where Joe Biden has
[3:33:32.640 --> 3:33:40.760]  come out and said 97% to 98% of Americans must be vaxxed before we get back to normal.
[3:33:40.760 --> 3:33:44.760]  He was asked how many need to be vaccinated for us to get back to normal?
[3:33:44.760 --> 3:33:49.280]  What is the percentage of total vaccinations that have to be deployed?
[3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:52.880]  Biden said I think we get the vast majority like what's going on in some industries and
[3:33:52.880 --> 3:33:59.000]  in some schools, 97%, 98%, I think we're getting awful close, they're not getting awful close
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:03.520]  to that, they're never going to get up to that, there's going to be at least 15% at
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:05.960]  least who don't take them.
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:09.560]  And they know they're never going to get up to that level and they know life is never
[3:34:09.560 --> 3:34:15.280]  going to get back to normal if they have their way because it's an unobtainable goal.
[3:34:15.280 --> 3:34:23.240]  When you look at situations where they vaccinated 95% of people like on Harvard campuses, we
[3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:29.360]  have this headline despite 95% vaccination rate, Harvard experiences substantial outbreak
[3:34:29.360 --> 3:34:30.360]  of COVID.
[3:34:30.360 --> 3:34:33.920]  This is Harvard Business School which has been forced to move its first and second year
[3:34:33.920 --> 3:34:39.280]  students to remote learning after a substantial outbreak of COVID.
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:42.520]  This is the head of communications to Harvard Business School.
[3:34:42.520 --> 3:34:46.000]  In recent days, we've seen a steady rise in breakthrough infections among our student
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:50.880]  population despite admitting that this breakthrough didn't even happen on campus, they're moving
[3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:57.160]  it all offline again, all back to remote learning, complete waste of money.
[3:34:57.160 --> 3:35:04.480]  According to their own dashboard, meanwhile, 95% of students and 96% of employees are vaccinated
[3:35:04.480 --> 3:35:11.320]  against the virus yet they've just had a huge spike just like what happened in Israel
[3:35:11.320 --> 3:35:15.720]  where they had a massive spike after vaccinating the majority of the population.
[3:35:15.720 --> 3:35:19.800]  It's happening on the campus of Harvard Business School.
[3:35:19.800 --> 3:35:23.520]  This again underscores how people will be mandated to get constant booster shots with
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:28.040]  all the attendant health risks because the longevity of protection the vaccine offers
[3:35:28.040 --> 3:35:29.440]  is minimal.
[3:35:29.440 --> 3:35:38.560]  Meanwhile, as the Israeli study showed, antibodies natural immunity offers 27 times more protection
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:43.200]  than the vaccine but now the media is out as we've seen over the past few days, busy
[3:35:43.200 --> 3:35:48.800]  suddenly claiming that natural immunity and antibodies don't exist at all.
[3:35:48.800 --> 3:35:53.320]  We had Vice Magazine come out with a ridiculous headline to that effect.
[3:35:53.320 --> 3:35:57.520]  So the vaccines aren't working and yet they're continuing to assert that Americans need to
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:36:03.080]  comply and take the vaccine despite the fact again that with this vaccine passport scheme
[3:36:03.080 --> 3:36:07.920]  in many countries, they're ruling out the ability to provide a negative test despite
[3:36:07.920 --> 3:36:11.680]  the fact that that proves you don't carry the virus.
[3:36:11.680 --> 3:36:16.600]  Having the vaccine doesn't prove you don't have the virus because the vaccine is turning
[3:36:16.600 --> 3:36:22.680]  out to be largely ineffective after a period of time.
[3:36:22.680 --> 3:36:27.400]  It's interesting what's happening in the NBA because we had the NBA come out a couple
[3:36:27.400 --> 3:36:32.360]  of weeks ago now and say that they won't force their athletes to get the shot.
[3:36:32.360 --> 3:36:38.680]  They forced all the staff members to get the shot but because 15% of NBA players have
[3:36:38.680 --> 3:36:42.760]  refused to take the shot, they can't mandate it.
[3:36:42.760 --> 3:36:46.760]  And in fact, there's some very interesting comments over the past few hours that came
[3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:52.880]  out from Jonathan Isaac, one of these NBA superstars, headline Jonathan Isaac addresses
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:55.360]  his stance on the COVID-19 vaccination.
[3:36:55.360 --> 3:37:00.920]  This is probably the clearest, most concise, cogent explanation of why somebody who is
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:06.280]  young, fit and healthy and who has had the vaccine, has the antibodies, has the natural
[3:37:06.280 --> 3:37:10.960]  immunity, should in no reasonable will be forced to take a vaccine.
[3:37:10.960 --> 3:37:12.600]  And we have those comments here.
[3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:14.440]  This is Jonathan Isaac.
[3:37:14.440 --> 3:37:15.440]  Let's roll in.
[3:37:15.440 --> 3:37:21.640]  Every player, every person in this world is going to make their own decision for themselves.
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:28.240]  I would like an explanation to people with vaccines, why are they still getting COVID?
[3:37:28.240 --> 3:37:32.240]  If that's something that we are supposed to highly be protected from, like, it's funny
[3:37:32.240 --> 3:37:37.320]  that all it reduces your chances of going to the hospital.
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:40.800]  It doesn't eliminate anybody from getting COVID, right?
[3:37:40.800 --> 3:37:43.200]  So everybody, is everybody in here vaccine?
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:45.000]  I would assume, right?
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:47.400]  So you all can still get COVID, right?
[3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:52.160]  We're less likely to die or go to the hospital.
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:53.160]  Okay.
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:57.720]  But you can still get COVID, right?
[3:37:57.720 --> 3:38:03.200]  So, and you can still pass it along with the vaccine, right?
[3:38:03.200 --> 3:38:06.320]  So, I'm going to ask, I'm just asking the question.
[3:38:06.320 --> 3:38:07.320]  Oh, sure.
[3:38:07.320 --> 3:38:11.720]  And so like, did having COVID back around the world, things like that, basically just
[3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:18.040]  saying, like, I don't have COVID in your mouth, but did having it change your opinion one
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:22.160]  way or another, like, did it kind of re-emphasize that I don't need the vaccine to have a vaccine?
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:27.560]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:28.560]  no, no.
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:29.560]  That wasn't a case.
[3:38:29.560 --> 3:38:33.600]  I mean, yeah, I had it, but that doesn't mean I can't get it again, you know?
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:36.760]  I mean, it's no different than somebody with the vaccine.
[3:38:36.760 --> 3:38:42.120]  I can, yes, I've developed antibodies for it, so my chances will be less likely now as
[3:38:42.120 --> 3:38:44.120]  well, right?
[3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:51.120]  But it's still a possibility, I mean, just like there are players and coaches and staff
[3:38:51.120 --> 3:38:54.640]  for a vaccine missing camp right now because of its own.
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:01.280]  That was actually Washington wizard star Bradley Beale.
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:02.560]  I was gonna play that clip anyway,
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:04.640]  but you made similar comments.
[3:39:04.640 --> 3:39:06.480]  Now we're gonna go to Jonathan Isaac.
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:08.000]  He said he's not anti-vax,
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:09.760]  but believes it should be a personal choice
[3:39:09.760 --> 3:39:12.880]  that's free of ridicule his Jonathan Isaac.
[3:39:14.360 --> 3:39:17.360]  Jonathan, Josh Robbins with the athletic.
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:19.000]  What is it about the vaccine
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  that makes you hesitant to get it?
[3:39:24.200 --> 3:39:29.200]  I would start with, I've had COVID in the past.
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:33.520]  And so our understanding of antibodies of natural immunity
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:37.640]  has changed a great deal from the onset of the pandemic
[3:39:37.640 --> 3:39:38.920]  and it's still evolving.
[3:39:40.160 --> 3:39:43.320]  I understand that the vaccine would help
[3:39:43.320 --> 3:39:47.600]  if you catch COVID and you'll be able to have less symptoms
[3:39:47.600 --> 3:39:49.880]  from contracting it, but with me having COVID in the past
[3:39:49.880 --> 3:39:53.760]  and having antibodies with my current age group
[3:39:53.760 --> 3:39:56.920]  and a fitness, physical fitness level.
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:39:59.520]  It's not necessarily a fear of mine.
[3:39:59.520 --> 3:40:02.600]  Taking the vaccine, like I said,
[3:40:02.600 --> 3:40:06.360]  it would decrease my chances of having a severe reaction,
[3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:08.240]  but it does open me up to the,
[3:40:08.240 --> 3:40:10.560]  albeit rare chance, but the possibility
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:13.240]  of having an adverse reaction to the vaccine itself.
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:18.240]  I don't believe that being unvaccinated means infected
[3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:21.920]  or being vaccinated means uninfected.
[3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:25.800]  You can still catch COVID with or without having the vaccine.
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:30.760]  I would say honestly, the craziness of it all
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:32.600]  in terms of not being able to say
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:34.240]  that it should be everybody's fair choice
[3:40:34.240 --> 3:40:37.880]  without being demeaned or talked crazy to
[3:40:37.880 --> 3:40:42.160]  doesn't make one comfortable to do what said person
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:44.040]  is telling them to do.
[3:40:45.840 --> 3:40:48.080]  Yeah, I would say that's a couple of the reasons
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:50.960]  that I'm hesitant at this time,
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:52.360]  but at the end of the day,
[3:40:52.360 --> 3:40:56.040]  I don't feel that it is anyone's reason to come out
[3:40:56.040 --> 3:40:58.200]  and say, well, this is why or this is not why
[3:40:58.200 --> 3:41:01.680]  it should just be their decision and loving your neighbors,
[3:41:01.680 --> 3:41:03.520]  not just loving those that agree with you
[3:41:03.520 --> 3:41:06.480]  or look like you are moving the same way that you do.
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:08.720]  It's loving those who don't.
[3:41:08.720 --> 3:41:12.840]  So that was Jonathan Isaac who went viral today
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:15.400]  with that clip simply explaining it was his body,
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:17.800]  his choice as a young, healthy athlete.
[3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:19.160]  He's got no reason to take it.
[3:41:19.160 --> 3:41:21.640]  He's got the antibodies, he's got the natural immunity.
[3:41:21.640 --> 3:41:24.360]  Apparently the natural immunity no longer exists
[3:41:24.360 --> 3:41:26.240]  because again, this isn't about public health.
[3:41:26.240 --> 3:41:28.360]  This is about mass compliance.
[3:41:28.360 --> 3:41:31.120]  Biden saying 98% of Americans need to get it
[3:41:31.120 --> 3:41:33.040]  before life goes back to normal.
[3:41:33.040 --> 3:41:34.120]  Never gonna happen.
[3:41:34.120 --> 3:41:36.440]  They don't want life to go back to normal.
[3:41:36.440 --> 3:41:39.120]  Pfizer CEO says normal life won't return
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:41.200]  without regular COVID vaccinations.
[3:41:41.200 --> 3:41:43.760]  They're talking about them every year,
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:47.160]  every six months for quote, vulnerable people.
[3:41:47.160 --> 3:41:48.120]  He says within a year,
[3:41:48.120 --> 3:41:50.520]  I think we'll be able to go back to normal life.
[3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:51.520]  Although he made it very clear,
[3:41:51.520 --> 3:41:53.160]  this statement only applies to those
[3:41:53.160 --> 3:41:56.360]  who are prepared to take regular coronavirus booster shots
[3:41:56.360 --> 3:41:59.120]  again with all the attendant health risks.
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:00.480]  He said, I don't think this means variants
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:01.960]  will not be continuing coming.
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:04.200]  And I don't think this means we should be able to live
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:07.160]  our lives without having vaccinations.
[3:42:07.160 --> 3:42:09.160]  That is the key statement.
[3:42:09.160 --> 3:42:10.560]  It's about mass compliance.
[3:42:10.560 --> 3:42:12.520]  It's not about public health.
[3:42:12.520 --> 3:42:14.520]  The countries that have had the mass vaccinations
[3:42:14.520 --> 3:42:17.120]  like Israel, they're still getting COVID cases spikes.
[3:42:17.120 --> 3:42:18.080]  They're still getting spikes
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:19.800]  on the campus of Harvard Business School
[3:42:19.800 --> 3:42:23.400]  despite being 95% vaccinated.
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:26.800]  Meanwhile, CEO of Moderna says even young people
[3:42:26.800 --> 3:42:29.760]  will need to take vaccine booster shots indefinitely
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:34.040]  despite the fact they literally have a 99.8% survival chance.
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:35.440]  If they get the virus,
[3:42:35.440 --> 3:42:36.800]  and again, if they've got the antibodies
[3:42:36.800 --> 3:42:38.000]  and natural immunity,
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:41.520]  that offers them 27 times more protection
[3:42:41.520 --> 3:42:46.520]  than these useless vaccines according to the Israel study.
[3:42:47.080 --> 3:42:49.320]  Gonna come back and talk about the Pope.
[3:42:49.320 --> 3:42:51.160]  This is Summit.News.
[3:42:51.160 --> 3:42:52.200]  Don't go away.

[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:51.280]  Head to InfowarsStore.com today.
[3:43:56.800 --> 3:44:01.440]  In late August, Infowars saw an explosion of orders
[3:44:01.440 --> 3:44:03.640]  because our audience understands
[3:44:03.640 --> 3:44:06.760]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet
[3:44:06.760 --> 3:44:09.160]  by design and are attempting to cause
[3:44:09.160 --> 3:44:13.040]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:44:13.040 --> 3:44:13.880]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:44:13.880 --> 3:44:15.600]  storeable food has always been something
[3:44:15.600 --> 3:44:16.680]  that's important to have.
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:18.640]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have,
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:21.600]  taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[3:44:21.600 --> 3:44:24.040]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[3:44:24.040 --> 3:44:25.480]  But now, more than ever,
[3:44:25.480 --> 3:44:27.400]  you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[3:44:27.400 --> 3:44:29.200]  Now, we're ready to ship to you
[3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:30.800]  within 24 hours of your order.

[3:44:33.160 --> 3:44:36.280]  at InfowarsStore.com because in the future,
[3:44:36.280 --> 3:44:38.560]  you're gonna see more food supply shortages
[3:44:38.560 --> 3:44:40.880]  and you're gonna see food supply price increases
[3:44:40.880 --> 3:44:42.200]  that are already taking place.
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:45.120]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:48.400]  and fund the Infowar at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:44:48.400 --> 3:44:50.280]  That's how you fight the great reset
[3:44:50.280 --> 3:44:53.160]  is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[3:44:53.160 --> 3:44:55.960]  So get prepared now at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:44:55.960 --> 3:45:00.960]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s.
[3:45:01.480 --> 3:45:03.360]  And then imagine a science fiction movie
[3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:06.200]  set in the year 2020 where a world government's
[3:45:06.200 --> 3:45:08.720]  being established, where members of Congress
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:11.200]  and former presidents are censured by big tech
[3:45:11.200 --> 3:45:14.360]  and where you don't take an experimental injection
[3:45:14.360 --> 3:45:18.240]  that grows blood plots and prions all over your body
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:21.960]  that you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[3:45:21.960 --> 3:45:24.200]  Think about that because that's where we are.
[3:45:24.200 --> 3:45:27.720]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, hell, just five years ago,
[3:45:27.720 --> 3:45:31.040]  if somebody told you this would be happening.
[3:45:31.040 --> 3:45:33.080]  But it is happening now.
[3:45:33.080 --> 3:45:34.520]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry,
[3:45:34.520 --> 3:45:36.240]  it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy
[3:45:36.240 --> 3:45:37.720]  and it doesn't really work.
[3:45:37.720 --> 3:45:39.640]  So you gotta take it every few months.
[3:45:39.640 --> 3:45:42.160]  And the people that have submitted say, great,
[3:45:42.160 --> 3:45:44.400]  I wanna take it all the time so I can go outside
[3:45:44.400 --> 3:45:45.880]  and not get sick from COVID,
[3:45:45.880 --> 3:45:47.600]  even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[3:45:47.600 --> 3:45:49.880]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people
[3:45:49.880 --> 3:45:52.560]  from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus.
[3:45:52.560 --> 3:45:54.360]  And that's in mainline studies.
[3:45:54.360 --> 3:45:56.080]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this.
[3:45:56.080 --> 3:45:58.360]  Need to go to prison for it right now.
[3:45:58.360 --> 3:46:00.960]  Oh, you wanna have a double-blind,
[3:46:00.960 --> 3:46:03.920]  randomized placebo testing without what that means.
[3:46:03.920 --> 3:46:07.000]  You give 20,000 people the vaccine
[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:09.520]  when it comes to phase two, phase three trials.
[3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:13.160]  And you give 20,000 people a placebo
[3:46:13.160 --> 3:46:15.400]  and then you really look at how it comes
[3:46:15.400 --> 3:46:17.800]  for a long period of time, not four weeks.
[3:46:18.760 --> 3:46:21.600]  There's a lot of these injuries, the autoimmune injuries
[3:46:21.600 --> 3:46:23.200]  you're not gonna see in four weeks,
[3:46:23.200 --> 3:46:25.880]  the cancer you're not gonna see in four weeks,
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:28.040]  and many of the neurological injuries
[3:46:28.040 --> 3:46:29.560]  you won't see for four weeks.
[3:46:29.560 --> 3:46:33.000]  If the experience with other vaccines is instructive,
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:35.360]  you look at the other vaccines
[3:46:35.360 --> 3:46:37.880]  that are currently in the schedule,
[3:46:37.880 --> 3:46:40.800]  and there's about 400 injuries,
[3:46:40.800 --> 3:46:43.120]  the illnesses, chronic illnesses that are listed.
[3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:45.280]  Robert Kennedy Jr. is just one
[3:46:45.280 --> 3:46:49.360]  of more than 40 powerful voices in the film COVIDland,
[3:46:49.360 --> 3:46:52.280]  exclusively available at covidland.com.
[3:46:52.280 --> 3:46:54.280]  When you order it now, you get a free copy
[3:46:54.280 --> 3:46:56.520]  of the in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:47:01.200 --> 3:47:04.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:10.160 --> 3:47:16.080]  ["The
[3:47:16.080 --> 3:47:23.080]  Pope is the Devil"]
[3:47:25.080 --> 3:47:26.760]  We're gonna go out with this video,
[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:29.680]  which is live up on YouTube, asking the question,
[3:47:29.680 --> 3:47:33.080]  what are the Pope's positions on vaccine passports,
[3:47:33.080 --> 3:47:35.560]  gay marriage, mass immigration, demographic replacement,
[3:47:35.560 --> 3:47:36.680]  and global government?
[3:47:36.680 --> 3:47:38.680]  And asking the question,
[3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:42.120]  is the Pope Catholic or is he actually doing
[3:47:42.120 --> 3:47:43.800]  the work of the devil?
[3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:46.240]  Here's the video.
[3:47:50.240 --> 3:47:52.520]  Pope Francis says conservative Catholics
[3:47:52.520 --> 3:47:55.240]  who criticise him for failing to defend the faith
[3:47:55.240 --> 3:47:57.920]  are performing the work of the devil.
[3:47:57.920 --> 3:48:01.200]  Oh, contraire, if anyone's doing the work of the devil,
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:03.640]  it's you that Pope claims his critics
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:06.320]  are whipping up hostility against the church.
[3:48:06.320 --> 3:48:09.560]  They're not attacking the church, they're attacking you.
[3:48:09.560 --> 3:48:11.880]  Why do you act like your actions and statements
[3:48:11.880 --> 3:48:15.000]  are separate from and not representative of the church?
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:18.120]  You're the supreme pontiff for f*** sake.
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:21.760]  You're the figurehead where you lead the church follows.
[3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:25.400]  And where you lead has been pretty disastrous, hasn't it?
[3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:27.960]  Mandating everyone who enters Vatican City
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:31.400]  show a green pass to prove they've been vaccinated.
[3:48:31.400 --> 3:48:34.120]  A green pass that Italians are being forced to take
[3:48:34.120 --> 3:48:36.000]  or face losing their jobs.
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:38.960]  A digital ID that tracks their location,
[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:42.640]  a huge lurch towards a social credit score system
[3:48:42.640 --> 3:48:45.160]  that could eventually be used to determine,
[3:48:45.160 --> 3:48:47.560]  based on level of compliance,
[3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:50.400]  whether somebody is allowed to buy or sell.
[3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:52.600]  Sorry, you're only on your ninth vaccination
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:54.120]  and we don't sell to racists.
[3:48:54.120 --> 3:48:56.480]  Yeah, when you're literally helping to fulfil
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:48:59.840]  the revelation's prophecy of the mark of the beast,
[3:48:59.840 --> 3:49:02.280]  that doesn't sound very Christian to me.
[3:49:02.280 --> 3:49:04.680]  Sounds more like the work of the devil.
[3:49:04.680 --> 3:49:07.000]  Archbishop Carl and Maria Vagana warns
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:09.520]  of a health dictatorship brought in under the banner
[3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:10.760]  of the Great Reset.
[3:49:10.760 --> 3:49:13.400]  We see heads of nations and religious leaders pandering
[3:49:13.400 --> 3:49:16.800]  to the suicide of Western culture and its Christian soul.
[3:49:16.800 --> 3:49:18.640]  While the fundamental rights of citizens
[3:49:18.640 --> 3:49:22.080]  and believers are denied in the name of a health emergency
[3:49:22.080 --> 3:49:24.280]  that is revealing itself more and more fully
[3:49:24.280 --> 3:49:26.320]  as instrumental to the establishment
[3:49:26.320 --> 3:49:29.000]  of an inhuman faceless tyranny.
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:31.120]  And what do you have to say about it?
[3:49:31.120 --> 3:49:33.240]  Shut up and take the vaccine.
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:34.480]  So Christian.
[3:49:34.480 --> 3:49:37.520]  Last year, you offered your support for gay marriage,
[3:49:37.520 --> 3:49:41.520]  saying same-sex couples should be able to form civil unions.
[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:43.040]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
[3:49:43.040 --> 3:49:44.880]  but I don't recall seeing much sympathy
[3:49:44.880 --> 3:49:47.280]  for homosexuality in the Bible.
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:49.680]  Whatever anyone thinks about gay marriage,
[3:49:49.680 --> 3:49:53.840]  one thing you can't describe it as is being very Christian.
[3:49:53.840 --> 3:49:55.600]  Not according to Pope Francis.
[3:49:55.600 --> 3:49:58.080]  What are you gonna do next? Endorse abortion.
[3:49:58.080 --> 3:50:02.360]  You also think there's no hell and that souls just disappear.
[3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:05.400]  Something that completely contradicts the Catholic Church's
[3:50:05.400 --> 3:50:09.520]  2,000-year-old teaching about the eternal existence of the soul.
[3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:11.760]  No soul, no consequences.
[3:50:11.760 --> 3:50:14.960]  Do what thou wilt, shall be the whole of the law.
[3:50:14.960 --> 3:50:17.240]  Yeah, that sounds like something,
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:19.080]  but it's definitely not Christian.
[3:50:19.080 --> 3:50:21.760]  You facilitated the church establishment
[3:50:21.760 --> 3:50:24.640]  targeting of conservative Catholics,
[3:50:24.640 --> 3:50:27.280]  merely for them trying to uphold the faith.
[3:50:27.280 --> 3:50:31.760]  Personally, I know many priests who have been canceled.
[3:50:31.760 --> 3:50:33.080]  But not for the reasons you'd think.
[3:50:33.080 --> 3:50:35.440]  I mean, it's not like they did a hit-and-run drive
[3:50:35.440 --> 3:50:36.680]  and left the scene of the crime,
[3:50:36.680 --> 3:50:38.960]  or embezzled church funds, stole the altar wine,
[3:50:38.960 --> 3:50:40.920]  or committed some other heinous crime.
[3:50:40.920 --> 3:50:42.960]  No, not at all.
[3:50:42.960 --> 3:50:44.400]  And who's persecuting them?
[3:50:44.400 --> 3:50:46.560]  Well, their own bishops.
[3:50:46.560 --> 3:50:48.160]  How's that?
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:49.680]  Yep, who are they?
[3:50:49.680 --> 3:50:53.640]  Well, they're a pack of men who generally passively sit by
[3:50:53.640 --> 3:50:56.440]  and tolerate any kind of nonsense,
[3:50:56.440 --> 3:50:59.680]  but if one of their priests utters something
[3:50:59.680 --> 3:51:01.520]  that resembles orthodoxy,
[3:51:01.520 --> 3:51:03.400]  well, then they spring into action,
[3:51:03.400 --> 3:51:06.480]  they reprimand him, and they bully him
[3:51:06.480 --> 3:51:07.920]  and do their best to cancel him.
[3:51:07.920 --> 3:51:10.440]  It's a symptom of a very deep sickness
[3:51:10.440 --> 3:51:13.200]  that afflicts the church.
[3:51:13.200 --> 3:51:15.720]  You've isolated and removed from power
[3:51:15.720 --> 3:51:18.400]  prominent Catholics like Cardinal Sarah,
[3:51:18.400 --> 3:51:21.360]  who, unlike you, has actually used his platform
[3:51:21.360 --> 3:51:22.760]  to defend the faith.
[3:51:22.760 --> 3:51:25.240]  On vous sent inquiet pour le monde occidental,
[3:51:25.240 --> 3:51:26.720]  qu'est-ce qui vous inquiète?
[3:51:26.720 --> 3:51:31.200]  Vous savez, la plus grande inquietude,
[3:51:31.200 --> 3:51:37.240]  c'est que l'Europe n'avait plus
[3:51:37.240 --> 3:51:42.080]  ou a perdu l'essence de ses origines.
[3:51:42.080 --> 3:51:45.120]  Il a perdu ses racines.
[3:51:45.120 --> 3:51:50.680]  Or, un arbre qui n'a pas de racines, il meurt.
[3:51:50.680 --> 3:51:54.200]  Et j'ai peur que l'Occident meurt.
[3:51:54.200 --> 3:51:57.000]  Et il y a beaucoup de signes, vous voyez-vous,
[3:51:57.000 --> 3:52:02.120]  beaucoup de signes, pas plus de natalité.
[3:52:02.120 --> 3:52:05.160]  Et vous dites envahir, quand même,
[3:52:05.160 --> 3:52:08.360]  par d'autres cultures, d'autres peuples
[3:52:08.360 --> 3:52:13.320]  qui vont progressivement vous dominer un nombre
[3:52:13.320 --> 3:52:17.360]  et changer totalement votre culture, vos convictions.
[3:52:17.360 --> 3:52:20.320]  Cardinal Sarah says it's a false exegesis
[3:52:20.320 --> 3:52:24.160]  to use the word of God to promote mass migration.
[3:52:24.160 --> 3:52:25.600]  And what do you say?
[3:52:25.600 --> 3:52:27.320]  Refugees welcome.
[3:52:27.320 --> 3:52:31.440]  The Pope kneels to wash the feet of a group of refugees.
[3:52:31.440 --> 3:52:35.080]  Nobody seems to care about the difference in their religions.
[3:52:35.080 --> 3:52:37.640]  Cardinal Francis Arinze says the Europeans
[3:52:37.640 --> 3:52:41.000]  must stop encouraging the departure of young Africans.
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:42.360]  Africa needs them.
[3:52:42.360 --> 3:52:44.400]  What do you say?
[3:52:44.400 --> 3:52:45.520]  Refugees welcome.
[3:52:45.520 --> 3:52:47.600]  US Cardinal Raymond Burke says that
[3:52:47.600 --> 3:52:50.800]  resisting large-scale immigration from Muslim countries
[3:52:50.800 --> 3:52:52.640]  is an act of patriotism.
[3:52:52.640 --> 3:52:55.640]  Burke said that Islam, by its definition,
[3:52:55.640 --> 3:52:58.480]  believes itself to be destined to rule the world.
[3:52:58.480 --> 3:53:00.360]  What do you say?
[3:53:00.360 --> 3:53:01.400]  Refugees welcome.
[3:53:01.400 --> 3:53:04.240]  You ignored the warning of Hungarian Prime Minister
[3:53:04.240 --> 3:53:07.120]  Viktor Orban, who begged you not to allow Christianity
[3:53:07.120 --> 3:53:11.400]  to perish via the mass importation of non-Christian migrants.
[3:53:11.400 --> 3:53:12.800]  How did you respond?
[3:53:12.800 --> 3:53:14.560]  By immediately telling Hungarians
[3:53:14.560 --> 3:53:17.080]  to open their arms to refugees.
[3:53:17.080 --> 3:53:21.000]  Because that's worked out so well for Europe so far, hasn't it?
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:23.960]  One of the refugees you posed with for a photo op
[3:53:23.960 --> 3:53:27.600]  was an illegal immigrant who went on to burn down a cathedral
[3:53:27.600 --> 3:53:30.040]  and kill a French priest in cold blood.
[3:53:30.040 --> 3:53:31.840]  What did you have to say about that?
[3:53:31.840 --> 3:53:32.680]  Nothing.
[3:53:32.680 --> 3:53:35.000]  What was your response to Charlie Hebdo?
[3:53:35.000 --> 3:53:37.240]  You literally sided with the terrorists
[3:53:37.240 --> 3:53:39.400]  and all but excused their actions.
[3:53:39.400 --> 3:53:42.720]  At the exact same time that the slaughtered cartoonists
[3:53:42.720 --> 3:53:44.040]  were being buried,
[3:53:44.040 --> 3:53:47.600]  you scorned them for insulting the Prophet Mohammed.
[3:53:47.600 --> 3:53:51.640]  It's true that you can't act violently,
[3:53:51.640 --> 3:53:55.080]  but if Dr. Gasparri, a great friend,
[3:53:55.080 --> 3:53:57.680]  tells you a word against my mother,
[3:53:57.680 --> 3:53:59.680]  you're waiting for a punch.
[3:53:59.680 --> 3:54:02.200]  But it's normal.
[3:54:02.200 --> 3:54:04.200]  It's normal.
[3:54:06.840 --> 3:54:09.280]  You can't provoke,
[3:54:09.280 --> 3:54:13.080]  you can't insult the faith of the devil.
[3:54:13.080 --> 3:54:16.400]  If only the Pope had as much respect for Christianity
[3:54:16.400 --> 3:54:17.800]  as he does for Islam.
[3:54:17.800 --> 3:54:19.040]  But I guess it's forgivable.
[3:54:19.040 --> 3:54:21.600]  I mean, it's not like he's the Pope or anything, is it?
[3:54:21.600 --> 3:54:25.080]  What was your response to the Orlando nightclub massacre
[3:54:25.080 --> 3:54:27.480]  carried out by an Islamic terrorist?
[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:31.720]  You blamed Christians and said they should apologize to gays.
[3:54:31.720 --> 3:54:34.200]  What was your response to the Paris massacre
[3:54:34.200 --> 3:54:37.720]  carried out by G. Haddis who exploited the refugee wave?
[3:54:37.720 --> 3:54:39.080]  Let more in.
[3:54:39.080 --> 3:54:40.840]  Refugees, welcome.
[3:54:40.840 --> 3:54:44.640]  Wash some more migrants' feet for the cameras.
[3:54:44.640 --> 3:54:46.640]  We're full, we've had enough.
[3:54:46.640 --> 3:54:49.120]  We've also had enough of your capitulation
[3:54:49.120 --> 3:54:51.080]  and betrayal of Christianity.
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:54.040]  Churches across Europe are being pillaged and burnt down.
[3:54:54.040 --> 3:54:56.080]  Statues are being decapitated.
[3:54:56.080 --> 3:54:58.640]  And what do you have to say about it?
[3:54:58.640 --> 3:55:00.640]  Refugees, welcome.
[3:55:00.640 --> 3:55:04.000]  If only the Pope had as much respect for Christianity
[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:07.400]  as he does the official religion of global government.
[3:55:07.400 --> 3:55:09.240]  Man-made climate change.
[3:55:09.240 --> 3:55:12.760]  You literally called for including environmental infractions
[3:55:12.760 --> 3:55:15.640]  into the catechism of the Catholic Church
[3:55:15.640 --> 3:55:20.440]  as sins against Gaia, Mother Earth, the false God.
[3:55:20.440 --> 3:55:24.000]  You literally called for the creation of a world government
[3:55:24.000 --> 3:55:25.800]  to fight climate change,
[3:55:25.800 --> 3:55:28.360]  trashing the nation state and calling for power
[3:55:28.360 --> 3:55:29.960]  to be transferred to, quote,
[3:55:29.960 --> 3:55:32.120]  inter-governmental institutions
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:34.520]  that manage their common interests.
[3:55:34.520 --> 3:55:35.720]  You went on to say, quote,
[3:55:35.720 --> 3:55:38.120]  this universal common good,
[3:55:38.120 --> 3:55:41.960]  in turn must acquire a more pronounced juridical value
[3:55:41.960 --> 3:55:43.960]  at international level.
[3:55:43.960 --> 3:55:46.800]  What does the Bible say about world government?
[3:55:46.800 --> 3:55:51.320]  Revelation 13.1, Daniel 7, 16-24,
[3:55:51.320 --> 3:55:53.520]  Daniel 2, 41-42.
[3:55:53.520 --> 3:55:57.680]  The beast system in the final days is world government,
[3:55:57.680 --> 3:56:00.400]  controlled by old Lucifer himself.
[3:56:00.400 --> 3:56:02.000]  That's what the Bible says.
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:04.800]  In his apocalyptic vision in the book of Revelation,
[3:56:04.800 --> 3:56:08.280]  the apostle John sees the beast, also called the Antichrist,
[3:56:08.280 --> 3:56:12.040]  rising out of the sea, having seven heads and 10 horns.
[3:56:12.040 --> 3:56:14.720]  Combining this vision with Daniel's similar one,
[3:56:14.720 --> 3:56:17.240]  we can conclude that some sort of world system
[3:56:17.240 --> 3:56:19.240]  will be inaugurated by the beast,
[3:56:19.240 --> 3:56:20.680]  the most powerful horn,
[3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:22.120]  who will defeat the other nine
[3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:25.120]  and will begin to wage war against Christians.
[3:56:25.120 --> 3:56:27.680]  The Ten Nation Confederacy is also seen
[3:56:27.680 --> 3:56:32.040]  in Daniel's image of the statue in Daniel 2, 41-42,
[3:56:32.040 --> 3:56:34.000]  where he pictures the final world government
[3:56:34.000 --> 3:56:35.720]  consisting of 10 entities
[3:56:35.720 --> 3:56:37.880]  represented by the 10 toes of the statue.
[3:56:37.880 --> 3:56:41.360]  Yeah, world government doesn't sound very Christian to me,
[3:56:41.360 --> 3:56:44.120]  and yet you're constantly promoting it.
[3:56:44.120 --> 3:56:44.960]  Why is that?
[3:56:44.960 --> 3:56:48.960]  So save me the sanctimonious finger-wagging at your critics.
[3:56:48.960 --> 3:56:52.640]  By every single measure, you're subverting the faith.
[3:56:52.640 --> 3:56:55.640]  Vaccine passports, gay marriage, mass immigration,
[3:56:55.640 --> 3:56:58.400]  demographic replacement, global government.
[3:56:58.400 --> 3:57:00.040]  You say anyone who questions you
[3:57:00.040 --> 3:57:02.200]  is performing the work of the devil,
[3:57:02.200 --> 3:57:05.360]  just like when you blamed the pedophile scandal on Satan
[3:57:05.360 --> 3:57:07.040]  while you helped cover it up.
[3:57:07.040 --> 3:57:11.120]  If your rhetoric and actions serve to bolster the very agenda
[3:57:11.120 --> 3:57:14.760]  that every anti-Christ globalist is striving for,
[3:57:14.760 --> 3:57:18.720]  then it's not your critics who are doing the work of the devil.
[3:57:18.720 --> 3:57:37.640]  It's you.
[3:57:37.640 --> 3:57:48.840]  I did what I had to do, saw it through without exemption.
[3:57:48.840 --> 3:57:51.720]  59 years old in good health.
[3:57:51.720 --> 3:57:54.040]  I'm not working in the front line.
[3:57:54.040 --> 3:57:59.440]  So my type is not recommended to get vaccination.
[3:57:59.440 --> 3:58:04.560]  That was the current CEO of Pfizer just a few months ago
[3:58:04.560 --> 3:58:06.720]  on a national TV interview saying,
[3:58:06.720 --> 3:58:11.920]  oh, he doesn't need to take the so-called mRNA vaccine
[3:58:11.920 --> 3:58:13.960]  that's really a gene therapy.
[3:58:13.960 --> 3:58:15.720]  He said, you know, he's 57 years old.
[3:58:15.720 --> 3:58:16.200]  He's healthy.
[3:58:16.200 --> 3:58:17.200]  He doesn't need it.
[3:58:17.200 --> 3:58:18.680]  It's at risk people, but that's not
[3:58:18.680 --> 3:58:22.440]  what his PR firms that have bought off the politicians
[3:58:22.440 --> 3:58:24.080]  over 100 countries say.
[3:58:24.080 --> 3:58:25.880]  They say, you've got to take it to have a job
[3:58:25.880 --> 3:58:29.040]  or leave your house or get on a plane or a train
[3:58:29.040 --> 3:58:31.600]  or even get outside your home for one hour a day
[3:58:31.600 --> 3:58:32.840]  if you live in Australia.
[3:58:32.840 --> 3:58:35.240]  So remember, the White House is exempt.
[3:58:35.240 --> 3:58:37.240]  Congress and their staff are exempt.
[3:58:37.240 --> 3:58:39.400]  The Postal Service is exempt.
[3:58:39.400 --> 3:58:40.960]  All these big corporate heads are exempt.
[3:58:40.960 --> 3:58:42.760]  They're not taking their poison vaccine.
[3:58:42.760 --> 3:58:44.520]  They're pushing it on you.
[3:58:44.520 --> 3:58:45.360]  Wake up, folks.
[3:58:45.360 --> 3:58:45.840]  Wake up.
[3:58:49.360 --> 3:58:51.040]  General Lee.
[3:58:51.040 --> 3:58:52.520]  It's General Milley.
[3:58:52.520 --> 3:58:54.240]  I just want you to know that Trump tried
[3:58:54.240 --> 3:58:58.000]  to overthrow the US government two days ago on January 6.
[3:58:58.000 --> 3:59:00.040]  And I just want you to know I've taken control
[3:59:00.040 --> 3:59:00.920]  of the nuclear weapons.
[3:59:00.920 --> 3:59:02.840]  And if Trump tries to launch an attack on you,
[3:59:02.840 --> 3:59:05.920]  we'll let you know first the attacks coming.
[3:59:05.920 --> 3:59:07.720]  That is from the transcript.
[3:59:07.720 --> 3:59:11.320]  Then he called Pelosi, Schumer, and others to say,
[3:59:11.320 --> 3:59:12.640]  I'm loyal to you.
[3:59:12.640 --> 3:59:15.080]  I'm going to protect Trump from using nuclear weapons.
[3:59:15.080 --> 3:59:17.440]  When Trump was going for detente with China and North
[3:59:17.440 --> 3:59:20.600]  Korea at the time, and Trump's responded saying it's a total lie.
[3:59:20.600 --> 3:59:22.480]  Pelosi's come out and admitted it happened.
[3:59:22.480 --> 3:59:24.120]  Hell, she bragged back on January 8
[3:59:24.120 --> 3:59:26.680]  that it took place then and is saying
[3:59:26.680 --> 3:59:29.640]  that she honors Milley and that he's this courageous person.
[3:59:29.640 --> 3:59:31.320]  So are all these other Democrats.
[3:59:31.320 --> 3:59:34.040]  So this is the permanent deep state coup that's
[3:59:34.040 --> 3:59:36.680]  been in control for a long time now coming out of the shadows
[3:59:36.680 --> 3:59:37.760]  publicly.
[3:59:37.760 --> 3:59:40.480]  Remember, these people literally hate you and your family.
[3:59:40.480 --> 3:59:44.360]  Now they're injecting you with poison, soft kill injections.
[3:59:44.360 --> 3:59:46.000]  Wake up America or be destroyed.
[3:59:46.000 --> 3:59:57.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[4:00:16.000 --> 4:00:30.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
