[00:18.060 --> 00:20.220] idores
[00:20.220 --> 00:23.340] ···
[00:24.660 --> 00:26.140]  number
[00:26.140 --> 00:27.920]  n
[00:27.920 --> 00:53.560]  You will never, you will never, you will never break the chains, never break the chains.
[00:53.560 --> 00:57.640]  Gotta break the chains right now or it'll be so incredibly hard to break them in the
[00:57.640 --> 01:01.400]  future and that's why I am in mourning.
[01:01.400 --> 01:05.560]  I am in great sadness, you know, you can go to the Yale reports and go to the Stanford
[01:05.560 --> 01:10.920]  reports and you can pull up the psychological profiles with the big think tanks and the
[01:10.920 --> 01:16.920]  federal government admitting they've designed the COVID-19 lockdown as a drill, as a psychological
[01:16.920 --> 01:21.440]  training to prepare you for the casualist society, the tracking apps, the social credit
[01:21.440 --> 01:29.200]  score, forced inoculations and so much more to bring in the post-human era and we consider
[01:29.200 --> 01:32.920]  and tell you how the lockdown is going to work and how it's never going to end.
[01:32.920 --> 01:39.240]  But then to actually live it and see it and to see an article that was put all over newspapers
[01:39.240 --> 01:47.680]  and publications from MSN to CNN by Nick Peyton Walsh this morning, I got up at 5 AM, went
[01:47.680 --> 01:54.560]  to the CNN front webpage to see what the enemy's up to and it said back to normal, why we must
[01:54.560 --> 01:57.480]  accept it won't happen.
[01:57.480 --> 02:00.640]  Here's the same article, different headline, there is no getting back to normal, experts
[02:00.640 --> 02:07.520]  say the sooner we accept that, the better and of course CNN had an earlier headline,
[02:07.520 --> 02:14.880]  they changed it, it was you're never taking your mask off.
[02:14.880 --> 02:19.040]  Think of that incredible power and to make you all watch each other and enforce on each
[02:19.040 --> 02:25.600]  other that everything else is attached to it and this morning I said, let me look up
[02:25.600 --> 02:36.240]  who this guy is, I said he'll probably be a defense correspondent reporting on CIA stories.
[02:36.240 --> 02:45.000]  And guess what happened when I looked up Nick Peyton Walsh, it's always the same, British
[02:45.000 --> 02:52.760]  assigned to covering CIA stories in combat zones including the assassination of Osama
[02:52.760 --> 02:57.040]  bin Laden and that whole fiction where they then killed most of the Navy SEALs that were
[02:57.040 --> 03:03.120]  involved in the mission a few weeks later in that helicopter.
[03:03.120 --> 03:07.440]  So that's just who these people are, they're the ruling class and they're telling you
[03:07.440 --> 03:10.480]  that they're going to put a hood over your head for the rest of your life and they're
[03:10.480 --> 03:13.720]  coming with their forced inoculations and this is an act of war.
[03:13.720 --> 03:18.080]  But when I read the article, it's everything we've told you word for word because it's
[03:18.080 --> 03:24.000]  a philosophy, it's a system.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.880]  And they say you will adapt to being slaves, remember I've told the story probably 500
[03:28.880 --> 03:32.640]  times, I'll tell it again, I'll tell it so many times I called Paul Watson this morning,
[03:32.640 --> 03:36.920]  remember the story about me on the plane first class flying to be on the view in New York
[03:36.920 --> 03:41.720]  and one of the heads of one of the big banks is on board sitting next to me, was visiting
[03:41.720 --> 03:48.160]  his dad, a former Army general, the nursing home in San Antonio and Paul goes, yeah and
[03:48.160 --> 03:53.080]  he told you will adapt to being slaves.
[03:53.080 --> 03:57.440]  The article actually says that.
[03:57.440 --> 04:01.880]  We know their whole philosophy, we know it's a fraud, we have Fauci on tape saying he wears
[04:01.880 --> 04:03.960]  the mask for political effect.
[04:03.960 --> 04:11.120]  We have Democrats saying it to the governor of Pennsylvania, I mean we have them, we know.
[04:11.120 --> 04:17.400]  So I was really upset today and a friend of mine who's been out of town for months on
[04:17.400 --> 04:27.800]  a job, somebody I've known for years, came by the house this morning and they came the
[04:27.800 --> 04:30.120]  door and knocked on it and I went and they were wearing a mask.
[04:30.120 --> 04:36.600]  I said hey, you need to wear a mask here and they said, oh I just want to, you know, just
[04:36.600 --> 04:37.600]  for your safety.
[04:37.600 --> 04:43.280]  See it's the virtue signal and I just said, hey I got something came up, just have a nice
[04:43.280 --> 04:46.520]  life and just throw them out of my house, I'll never talk to them again.
[04:46.520 --> 04:52.760]  So you make your decision on this, this is everything, this is their takeover and if
[04:52.760 --> 04:54.960]  you submit to it, you're all done, you understand?
[04:54.960 --> 05:08.120]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci and I've been at the NIH at CDC for 45 years and I've overseen
[05:08.120 --> 05:15.240]  well, you know the AIDS pandemic and so many other things and I take my orders from Bill
[05:15.240 --> 05:22.600]  Gates, Dr. Bill Gates, I mean he's not a doctor but he controls everything you do and he now
[05:22.600 --> 05:28.400]  says you're going to take the shots and of course in England they are now saying when
[05:28.400 --> 05:35.120]  I told you, you will not be allowed to travel, leave your home until you take all the shots.
[05:35.120 --> 05:42.360]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill Gates, your owner, your master says you will have to take four
[05:42.360 --> 05:51.440]  to five COVID shots a year for adult, two for baby, baby much more manageable just like
[05:51.440 --> 06:03.200]  Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine, I'm Dr. Fauci reminding you that we owe you.
[06:03.200 --> 06:11.040]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[06:11.040 --> 06:17.560]  Well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:17.560 --> 06:26.800]  It is October 1st on this live Thursday worldwide transmission, you're 32 days out from the
[06:26.800 --> 06:30.400]  election but that's when things really get hairy.
[06:30.400 --> 06:34.160]  Now the public's finally figuring out, the Democrats have pledged to contest the election
[06:34.160 --> 06:42.360]  and that if Trump challenges their fraud they will claim that he is a dictator but finally
[06:42.360 --> 06:46.880]  ahead of the election people are understanding we've got to affect the psychological warfare
[06:46.880 --> 06:52.880]  operation now with the truth, we can't wait and be hit flat footed, that is all coming
[06:52.880 --> 07:01.040]  up here today and we have a raft of guests today, we have Ron in Florida who said he's
[07:01.040 --> 07:06.800]  a retired police officer out of New York City and he was only on about two minutes and everything
[07:06.800 --> 07:11.600]  he was saying was stuff that only an insider would know and then I would give a vague statement
[07:11.600 --> 07:20.640]  and he would answer it instantly, so obviously a smart cookie, so he's a caller, he's gonna
[07:20.640 --> 07:26.400]  be popping in at the bottom of the hour, we appreciate him doing that, John Rappaport,
[07:26.400 --> 07:31.520]  I was sitting there eating my lunch when he came on in the fourth hour and he always is
[07:31.520 --> 07:35.840]  very informative but I had missed something he'd been talking about so as soon as he talked
[07:35.840 --> 07:43.000]  about it I went and looked it up and it was so bombshell that it was staggering, it was
[07:43.000 --> 07:50.040]  staggering, in fact it's the biggest COVID fraud yet, the biggest COVID hoax yet, COVID
[07:50.040 --> 07:56.920]  itself is real, very very weak, you only die if you have the lower to mean system because
[07:56.920 --> 07:59.960]  you don't have the vitamins and minerals you need, even Fauci admits that now but it can't
[07:59.960 --> 08:05.800]  kill you but there's a lot of hoaxes within it saying people that died of something else
[08:05.800 --> 08:14.360]  died of COVID killing people with intubation and then saying with something else kill them
[08:14.360 --> 08:18.920]  sending sick people into hospitals or in nursing homes where you can kill people that already
[08:18.920 --> 08:23.920]  have a bunch of pre-existing conditions, co-morbidities, I mean there's a lot of fraud surrounding
[08:23.920 --> 08:27.840]  it, the fraudulent positive test, it goes on and on, we tend to repeat that minutiae
[08:27.840 --> 08:31.720]  over and over again, it's a big picture of the UN and the globalist admitting it's
[08:31.720 --> 08:35.880]  a political power grab and communist China admitting it's a political power grab to bring
[08:35.880 --> 08:40.560]  in global tracking, global social score and the rest of it but he was saying something
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.640]  on air and I'm celebrating my lunch and I've got my little iPhone right here so I'm searching
[08:46.640 --> 08:52.040]  what he's saying and I didn't know this, the major vaccines they're coming out, the
[08:52.040 --> 08:57.160]  parameters that the UN has put out that we adopt then because the UN's now world government
[08:57.160 --> 09:04.400]  don't run it, boom, just like that, oh it's the new normal, UN runs everything, move forward,
[09:04.400 --> 09:13.520]  that the vaccine is not to protect you from a dangerous COVID-19 strain or lethal strain
[09:13.520 --> 09:20.680]  that it is only to give you quote antibodies though they admit that won't protect you,
[09:20.680 --> 09:24.720]  so they're saying it makes you sick, they're saying it doesn't protect you and they're
[09:24.720 --> 09:33.360]  saying we're getting the vaccine authorized and admitting it's worthless and it was so
[09:33.360 --> 09:38.480]  profound, I came back on air and turned my mic on, I'm in a weird position where I can
[09:38.480 --> 09:41.840]  be over a radio TV network and eat my lunch and just like pop in over somebody, it was
[09:41.840 --> 09:47.400]  kind of rude but maybe you guys can get that towards the end of this third segment where
[09:47.400 --> 09:52.120]  he's sitting there talking about it and I just pop in and I say so, you're saying they
[09:52.120 --> 09:55.760]  admit the vaccine doesn't even work as a total fraud, then they'll keep the whole scam of
[09:55.760 --> 10:00.320]  the lockdowns and the masks going into the future and he goes absolutely, I mean this
[10:00.320 --> 10:06.280]  is just teaching you to not have logic, John Rappaport's joining us star of the next hour,
[10:06.280 --> 10:10.520]  Ali Alexander, really informative, intelligent political analyst, give us his take on the
[10:10.520 --> 10:15.320]  debate and what's moving forward, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy at the
[10:15.320 --> 10:19.960]  Treasury, the father of Reaganomics, he hadn't been on a while, we're really excited to have
[10:19.960 --> 10:24.520]  him coming on the show and then Patrick Howley has broken some really big news, there have
[10:24.520 --> 10:30.040]  been some big developments on the nexium cult and the conviction of nexium overlord Claire
[10:30.040 --> 10:35.280]  Brothman, that's coming up and then of course, former Navy SEAL by selling author, really
[10:35.280 --> 10:39.280]  smart guy, getting into the whole riots of BLM and what's coming up in the election,
[10:39.280 --> 10:44.160]  32 days out, Matt Bracken and then you've got the war with Owen Schroyer coming up
[10:44.160 --> 10:47.320]  after that but again, I'm your host, Alex Jones, very, very thankful for you tuning
[10:47.320 --> 10:53.200]  in today, okay, let me just in this segment tell you what's coming up, again, I got up
[10:53.200 --> 10:57.600]  about 435 in the morning and I like to go to CNN to see what the enemy's up to and there
[10:57.600 --> 11:03.560]  was the headline, master never coming off, lockdowns never ending the new normal, now
[11:03.560 --> 11:08.880]  we knew that was coming, so oh, just 15 days, oh, just two months, oh, just six months,
[11:08.880 --> 11:13.640]  oh, into next year, oh, just two years, oh, it's never gonna stop and they say even when
[11:13.640 --> 11:17.800]  you have contact tracing, even when you have the apps on your phone, even when you're being
[11:17.800 --> 11:21.360]  tracked and even when you have the inoculation, it's not gonna protect you, you gotta wear
[11:21.360 --> 11:27.400]  a mask, they love as psycho control for each the power of having that muzzle over your
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.880]  face and you not being able to show your face in public and no one having individualism
[11:32.880 --> 11:37.080]  and it gets into the occult and being able to have kidnapped children, they can move
[11:37.080 --> 11:41.560]  around and globalists being able to wear masks and the fact that that's a sign of a criminal
[11:41.560 --> 11:46.200]  society and that we're dirty and we're bad and we're spreading disease and so we hate
[11:46.200 --> 11:52.120]  our own species, this is about self loathing and deep guilt and again, Yale has big studies
[11:52.120 --> 11:56.600]  out this year how they wore game to wear the mask during a pandemic and how to create guilt
[11:56.600 --> 12:02.240]  and how to see other people are heroes when they wear it, so a long time person I've known
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.600]  for many years came by the house this morning and they come to the door and they're wearing
[12:06.600 --> 12:11.040]  a mask and I let them as they go, hadn't seen you at all, dropped by, just saying hi and
[12:11.040 --> 12:16.160]  they were just looking at me with total satisfaction in their eyes wearing the mask, I'm like oh
[12:16.160 --> 12:20.160]  you're a hero, you're protecting me and they're like yes I'm protecting you and it was actually,
[12:20.160 --> 12:28.360]  I guess the visit was to just let me know that this person's a hero but really it means
[12:28.360 --> 12:35.320]  you just bought the induction of the cult program, what was the headline just a month
[12:35.320 --> 12:41.080]  ago, federal government working with Yale in research study to get public to comply
[12:41.080 --> 12:47.640]  with vaccines, another headline the same story was 15 government working on 15 ways to make
[12:47.640 --> 12:53.440]  you take COVID vaccine, it's like say you're a hero, guilt someone do all this and the fine
[12:53.440 --> 12:58.760]  print says we'll make you sick, won't protect you but you're going to take it, there it
[12:58.760 --> 13:03.960]  is federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials on how best to persuade Americans
[13:03.960 --> 13:10.120]  to take COVID-19 vaccine, please print that for me, so that's just one article back to
[13:10.120 --> 13:15.400]  normal why we must accept it won't ever happen and they say they say a lot of people will
[13:15.400 --> 13:20.360]  resist but a good number are good and will adapt to doing what they're told and will
[13:20.360 --> 13:25.920]  wear the mask and then soon even mothers will wear them when they see their babies and you
[13:25.920 --> 13:31.440]  will never see your mommy's face, the face will now be like looking at someone's spread
[13:31.440 --> 13:40.040]  ash, the face will now be like looking at a man's penis, seriously, it will be a shock
[13:40.040 --> 13:45.960]  you see like all the Muslims will never get our women to wear a mask, boom, what you think
[13:45.960 --> 13:51.440]  Muhammad and those guys cooked that up, they had a lot of ancient cults that made you wear
[13:51.440 --> 13:58.280]  a mask and slaves had to wear a mask, only the king can be seen and so the politicians
[13:58.280 --> 14:04.080]  all they don't wear a mask, you wear a mask, you wear them you dirty little rats, your
[14:04.080 --> 14:09.480]  piece is a filth and so the dirtiest part of the body, oh the mouth, the truth is our
[14:09.480 --> 14:14.040]  bacteria our viruses 99% of the time make you healthier but they're teaching you that
[14:14.040 --> 14:16.560]  you're dirty, they're teaching you that you're bad, they're teaching you that you have to
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.400]  hate yourself because this is about post human exterminism and they tell you in the Wall
[14:20.400 --> 14:26.920]  Street Journal and NBC and the Nature Conservancy they all say oh looking forward to the end
[14:26.920 --> 14:34.240]  of humanity, you know COVID shows us we're just dirty, we're just bad and so we just
[14:34.240 --> 14:38.760]  have to end our species and oh we've got a mega elite that are going to guide us into
[14:38.760 --> 14:43.160]  the end of our species and who can lie, humans are bad for the earth, let's just get rid
[14:43.160 --> 14:51.560]  of ourselves, imagine if you went to the movies and say 1999 and you saw a movie about 2020
[14:51.560 --> 14:55.040]  where you're wearing masks and there's force inoculations coming and they're telling you
[14:55.040 --> 14:59.280]  they're dreaming of the end of humanity and it's so cool to kill yourself and 30% of the
[14:59.280 --> 15:05.200]  public is on psychotropic drugs and pedophilia is being promoted as good and this is it,
[15:05.200 --> 15:11.560]  this is their satanic big move against everybody and people are embracing it and they're putting
[15:11.560 --> 15:15.520]  the mask on, they're going to take five shots a year that Bill Gates says of just COVID
[15:15.520 --> 15:19.760]  alone and it goes in and changes their cells and makes them GMO and they admit it really
[15:19.760 --> 15:24.480]  hurts you, there's like I don't care, God I'm a hero, oh I'm wearing the mouth, get
[15:24.480 --> 15:28.240]  me, they're a child, they give the child a shot, it has convulsions, never talks again
[15:28.240 --> 15:34.720]  but oh they're heroes, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's all like human sacrifice, taking your child
[15:34.720 --> 15:39.480]  up to the ancient Babylonian, to the ancient Egyptian, to the ancient Mesoamerican, every
[15:39.480 --> 15:43.040]  culture of the ancient druids, they would bring their little three-year-old up, that
[15:43.040 --> 15:47.480]  was their favorite age and bye-bye and the priests would say good, take that nice, you
[15:47.480 --> 15:55.440]  would slit their throat and mommy loved it, cause mommy was a hero, ha ha ha ha ha, oh
[15:55.440 --> 16:02.240]  it's so loving, the Renaissance, the great enlightenment, it's all being swept away and
[16:02.240 --> 16:12.320]  being replaced by scientific tyranny, establishing a form of planetary digital law, where the
[16:12.320 --> 16:18.480]  technocrats are above the law and the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as
[16:18.480 --> 16:24.800]  a cow, in fact humans are seen as garbage that's gonna be taken out and removed, that
[16:24.800 --> 16:31.160]  is the post-human exterminist plan, that is the public ideology of the globalists and
[16:31.160 --> 16:36.400]  everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our
[16:36.400 --> 16:43.440]  minds as we're slowly killed and any future generations that happen to straggle out of
[16:43.440 --> 16:50.080]  their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were, this is the satanic
[16:50.080 --> 16:56.320]  ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against God's creation, humanity, this is the essence
[16:56.320 --> 16:57.320]  of evil.
[16:57.320 --> 17:02.080]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very very simple, they get to give
[17:02.080 --> 17:07.080]  up freedoms by increments, always promising it's only gonna be a short period of time
[17:07.080 --> 17:12.560]  and then the restructions will be released, but they're not, they have a significant amount
[17:12.560 --> 17:16.800]  of time, always four or five times longer than what they said, they will then slightly
[17:16.800 --> 17:22.000]  release it a little bit to only tighten it down even more later, this is called successive
[17:22.000 --> 17:28.080]  approximation incrementalism or the inchworm effect, this is the most common way that the
[17:28.080 --> 17:33.600]  Salatarians take over, but there then becomes a point where the public wakes up, under the
[17:33.600 --> 17:38.600]  incrementalism he starts resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clampdown
[17:38.600 --> 17:42.560]  and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks or months than you
[17:42.560 --> 17:47.960]  saw in the previous ten years and that's the period we're in globally right now, a world
[17:47.960 --> 17:53.600]  government, chai combat, globalist corporate takeover of the planet that once you pour
[17:53.600 --> 18:00.600]  in absolutely sick under their thumb forever, you're listening to the alex jones show
[18:23.600 --> 18:30.600]  I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say that you still
[18:30.600 --> 18:37.600]  want me, well that says maybe, but you gotta stand trial, because not a while, I can see,
[19:00.600 --> 19:07.600]  and you can see for miles and miles and miles, it's your job to raise the alarm with extreme
[19:09.560 --> 19:16.560]  urgency now, here's an example of what I've got coming up, Governor Cuomo came out in
[19:18.560 --> 19:24.280]  the New York Times and he said, I never sent any patients with COVID-19 in nursing homes,
[19:24.280 --> 19:28.560]  even though he's on video going, I am ordering this to happen, even though we have his executive
[19:28.560 --> 19:35.560]  order right here, think of the magnitude of him gaslighting you like that, but that's
[19:37.800 --> 19:44.800]  what they do, so yes they've announced that the lockdown is permanent, yes it's never
[19:46.480 --> 19:51.520]  going to stop, yes we told you that eight months ago, this is a total societal takeover
[19:51.520 --> 19:56.120]  to see what they can get you to do, that's why in the UK and Australia they're saying
[19:56.120 --> 20:03.000]  if you're walking by someone look away, now they're saying don't look someone in the eyes,
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.400]  this is voodoo folks, this is superstition and this is seeing once they get someone under
[20:07.400 --> 20:12.640]  Stockholm syndrome to wear a mask when they're driving in their car or when they're walking
[20:12.640 --> 20:18.600]  down a forest path by themselves, I mean I go down on the green belt sometimes at 6.30
[20:18.600 --> 20:21.440]  in the morning when it's dark, I'll be out in the middle of nowhere, I won't see somebody
[20:21.440 --> 20:26.120]  for 30 minutes and you'll see a woman or a man walking along a little forest path, they
[20:26.120 --> 20:32.520]  don't even see you and they're wearing a damn mask, total cult programming, of course
[20:32.520 --> 20:36.560]  they're going to take the inoculations and they're going to have the social score on
[20:36.560 --> 20:43.560]  their card and they're going to demand that you do it as well, so this is the minders,
[20:44.880 --> 20:50.560]  this is who they're organizing against us, but let me give you the goodness, it's this
[20:50.560 --> 20:56.680]  right here, nexium cult going down, the brothmans are right up there with the top globalist,
[20:56.680 --> 21:01.440]  they are right up there with sex cults, there's a big report, Patrick Howley's going to be
[21:01.440 --> 21:08.120]  joining us on this at the end of the fourth hour, nexium overlord Claire Brothman, illegal
[21:08.120 --> 21:13.240]  Clinton bundler sentenced to prison, they were involved in child trafficking internationally
[21:13.240 --> 21:19.360]  around the world, they were tied into the Mexican government, John of God, Oprah Winfrey
[21:19.360 --> 21:25.680]  and these people love having women and children that act like robots and worship them, can
[21:25.680 --> 21:32.920]  you imagine how pathetic would be to have one of these mansions that they call temples
[21:32.920 --> 21:37.160]  and everyone shakes and grovels and they only get enough calories to stay alive and they're
[21:37.160 --> 21:43.720]  anorexic and they cut themselves under orders and then these weird women mainly, these high
[21:43.720 --> 21:50.760]  priestesses of the brothmans, they walk around and look at other women starving to death
[21:50.760 --> 21:57.240]  and seeing them shrunken and pathetic and alone makes them happy, well that's just
[21:57.240 --> 22:02.800]  out in the open, nothing makes these demons happier than a child in a cage begging for
[22:02.800 --> 22:06.960]  mommy starving to death and they'll just come in and eat big meals in front of them
[22:06.960 --> 22:12.240]  and drink wine and have sex and do everything, while women and children are their favorites,
[22:12.240 --> 22:16.200]  starve to death and beg out to God and they come to the cages and they go, God's never
[22:16.200 --> 22:21.080]  coming, this is all come out, they come to the cage and they go, you're going to be
[22:21.080 --> 22:25.200]  in here and you're going to starve to death you little piece of crap and your God isn't
[22:25.200 --> 22:29.600]  going to help you and so these are their temples, so when you see a Bill Clinton or Hillary
[22:29.600 --> 22:36.880]  Clinton or Barack Obama, remember they love children dying in cages and the next level
[22:36.880 --> 22:43.360]  of this is a mask on you and deadly inoculations in you and maiming you and giving you cancer
[22:43.360 --> 22:49.120]  and sterilizing you and causing a massive DNA damage in your cells because that's their
[22:49.120 --> 22:54.240]  miserable power over you.
[22:54.240 --> 22:58.000]  The lockdown's just the beginning of bankrupting the world economy, starving the third world
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.400]  to death, tens of millions already starving, two million have already died and having all
[23:02.400 --> 23:07.960]  this idiocy and then particularly women, I was out last Saturday flying a drone over
[23:07.960 --> 23:12.680]  Zilker Park with a speaker on it exposing the COVID-19's causing mass lockdowns, mass
[23:12.680 --> 23:16.920]  death and it's not the COVID, it's the lockdown doing it, it's the UN, the very group behind
[23:16.920 --> 23:20.200]  it's now raising billions of dollars that they keep for themselves off the backs of
[23:20.200 --> 23:21.800]  the people that are dying.
[23:21.800 --> 23:25.280]  Before I launched the drone, I'm like 50 feet away, there's a ring of women all wearing
[23:25.280 --> 23:32.800]  masks under a tree, beautiful sunny day out there, they're hiding from the vitamin D and
[23:32.800 --> 23:37.560]  they hear me going, the third world is starving, death and mass, people are wearing masks,
[23:37.560 --> 23:41.400]  the virtue signal, they're not protecting people, the lockdown is killing folks, we
[23:41.400 --> 23:47.080]  must admit that COVID-19 is a giant scam and they began to go, we are saving people,
[23:47.080 --> 23:55.120]  we are heroes, I got it on video, they said we are heroes and I tried to walk over nicely
[23:55.120 --> 24:00.960]  and they pulled Mace out and said get away from us and I said well you're the one talking
[24:00.960 --> 24:06.600]  to me, I just said I want you to know, you can type into a search engine, COVID-19 lockdown
[24:06.600 --> 24:12.640]  causing mass starvation and they just flipped me off and said get out, away from us, racist,
[24:12.640 --> 24:15.320]  they were almost all white women, there was one black woman and she looked at me with
[24:15.320 --> 24:21.080]  disgust, I mean, you know, I'm a white male and see she's been taught that that's the
[24:21.080 --> 24:25.720]  bad guy, even though it's the scientific dictatorship doing all this, but here's the
[24:25.720 --> 24:33.880]  good news, imagine the little demonic, sick, hunchback demon types, imagine the type of
[24:33.880 --> 24:45.800]  individuals, imagine those type of individuals and their whole entire world, their whole
[24:45.800 --> 24:51.280]  entire universe is about having people starving under their control, you go wait, they want
[24:51.280 --> 24:55.080]  to starve kids in cages down in their dungeons where they have dinner and that makes them
[24:55.080 --> 24:59.240]  feel powerful to have a man, a woman, a little kid begging for mommy, you know, in a cage
[24:59.240 --> 25:02.680]  while they're eating food and having a good time, while they're watching TV, oh you want
[25:02.680 --> 25:06.280]  some food, sorry, you're not getting any, that's what a demon's like, the selfishness
[25:06.280 --> 25:11.880]  is their god, the power, the humiliation, the evilness of god hating them, they love
[25:11.880 --> 25:17.000]  God's hate, they love feeling God's vengeance, they love hurting the Holy Spirit, they love
[25:17.000 --> 25:23.000]  doing that in front of God, they love hurting those children, what do their wars do, what
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.280]  do their lives do, what does Hollywood do with the stolen innocence, what do the starving
[25:27.280 --> 25:34.200]  the third world do, while Wall Street will pay $100 million for a skull with semen on
[25:34.200 --> 25:40.400]  it and then they'll just take that money and just flush it, they will, they will, they
[25:40.400 --> 25:44.080]  will repossess old people's homes, they will scrabble every dollar they can get and then
[25:44.080 --> 25:49.200]  they will put it into a big brokerage firm and then ride it off and just destroy billions
[25:49.200 --> 25:54.160]  of dollars a minute just trying to destroy your wealth and trying to make you poor, they
[25:54.160 --> 25:59.840]  want to take money and take wealth and destroy it so that you don't have it and they have
[25:59.840 --> 26:05.120]  it and they hurt you, they want wealth to hurt you and to poison you and to attack you,
[26:05.120 --> 26:08.240]  they want to take your genetics, they want to take your decency, they want to not let
[26:08.240 --> 26:11.320]  you go to the park, they don't want to let you go to Barton Springs, they don't want
[26:11.320 --> 26:18.640]  to do that because they're murdering scum in a satanic cult, but the good news is when
[26:18.640 --> 26:23.720]  you look at brothman, look at this witch, literal witch and all that stuff they're doing in
[26:23.720 --> 26:29.560]  upstate New York and all the weird crap they're in, look how scared they are, they're doing
[26:29.560 --> 26:33.160]  all this because they know we're on to them so they want to be able to look out and see
[26:33.160 --> 26:37.840]  us wearing those masks and see us doing what they say and taking those shots because they
[26:37.840 --> 26:41.720]  want to have us just like those children with a gag in our mouth in those cages and that
[26:41.720 --> 26:44.160]  makes them feel good because they know we're on to them.
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.240]  So when you wear the mask, you are helping murder children, when you wear the mask, you're
[26:48.240 --> 26:52.480]  killing the third world, when you go along with this, you are joining the cult of Satan,
[26:52.480 --> 26:55.860]  wearing the mask is a symbol that you are in the satanic cult.
[26:55.860 --> 27:01.240]  This is your last chance to get a packed power stack and I'm really bummed out about that.
[27:01.240 --> 27:05.400]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and sort
[27:05.400 --> 27:09.520]  of reordering it, they spread the word and became one of our best sellers, but because
[27:09.520 --> 27:14.080]  of the COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in a packed
[27:14.080 --> 27:17.960]  power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[27:17.960 --> 27:23.200]  This is the highest end AMPM packed system you're going to find where you take half the
[27:23.200 --> 27:26.520]  pills in the morning, half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night.
[27:26.520 --> 27:27.520]  It's amazing.
[27:27.520 --> 27:30.720]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to
[27:30.720 --> 27:34.360]  take it and that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is
[27:34.360 --> 27:35.360]  absolutely amazing.
[27:35.360 --> 27:40.120]  So it's your last chance to get a power stack at infowarstore.com, it's 60% off and free
[27:40.120 --> 27:44.080]  shipping that is at cost for all of you that already support InfoWars, we're passing these

[27:55.760 --> 27:59.120]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[27:59.120 --> 28:01.080]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[28:01.080 --> 28:04.600]  Is your city too safe?
[28:04.600 --> 28:06.760]  Well, not anymore.
[28:06.760 --> 28:09.520]  Introducing Democrats.
[28:09.520 --> 28:15.080]  Politicians so incompetent they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant
[28:15.080 --> 28:17.920]  violence and even homelessness.
[28:17.920 --> 28:22.960]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[28:22.960 --> 28:25.080]  No more pesky law and order.
[28:25.080 --> 28:29.280]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[28:29.280 --> 28:33.960]  Only vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[28:33.960 --> 28:40.160]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[28:40.160 --> 28:44.720]  cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[28:44.720 --> 28:55.640]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[28:55.640 --> 28:58.600]  The planets have aligned globally.
[28:58.600 --> 29:04.760]  They've aligned financially, culturally, but most importantly, spiritually.
[29:04.760 --> 29:10.760]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny
[29:10.760 --> 29:11.760]  of our species.
[29:11.760 --> 29:16.840]  That's why big tech control by the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.800]  us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone and traffic control every aspect
[29:22.800 --> 29:23.800]  of our lives.
[29:23.800 --> 29:28.000]  Literally, brainwashing us with the stimuli that they put forward because they do not
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.560]  want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana, but of true Christendom and the
[29:33.560 --> 29:36.040]  Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.160]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and
[29:40.160 --> 29:45.440]  life extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon
[29:45.440 --> 29:48.480]  credits and through a social credit score.
[29:48.480 --> 29:50.360]  This is their plan.
[29:50.360 --> 29:58.720]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no, we must embrace God.
[29:58.720 --> 30:25.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:25.120 --> 30:28.960]  Two days out from the deep state chai con globalist disputing the election and trying
[30:28.960 --> 30:32.240]  to plunge the country into civil war under the 20th amendment.
[30:32.240 --> 30:35.280]  They can keep the election contested until the 20th of January.
[30:35.280 --> 30:39.640]  Nancy Pelosi under the Constitution will have a house vote to appoint the next president
[30:39.640 --> 30:44.680]  of the United States, the 46th president of the United States.
[30:44.680 --> 30:46.480]  That is their stated plan.
[30:46.480 --> 30:50.600]  People have been totally flat footed understanding that now people are starting to finally get
[30:50.600 --> 30:51.600]  it.
[30:51.600 --> 30:52.600]  That is goodness.
[30:52.600 --> 30:53.600]  Great job.
[30:53.600 --> 30:56.320]  If you are the tip of the spear, you have really gotten that out.
[30:56.320 --> 31:00.720]  If you see the lockdowns, the face masks, the force inoculations coming and being announced
[31:00.720 --> 31:08.200]  and it is frightening, remember it is criminals like this, Maxwell, Epstein and of course Harvey
[31:08.200 --> 31:16.120]  Weinstein and Rothman and the Clintons and the Obamas and all these statinists that are
[31:16.120 --> 31:21.800]  going to jail and that are being exposed and they made their cult members wear a mask.
[31:21.800 --> 31:25.480]  They made their cult members do all this and so they are just trying to put us under their
[31:25.480 --> 31:29.480]  cult member control, it is going to go down.
[31:29.480 --> 31:34.160]  Now shifting gears into the larger issue of the police state, it is not the police themselves
[31:34.160 --> 31:38.880]  are bad but they are controlled by politicians that can give them unconstitutional orders
[31:38.880 --> 31:45.560]  and so they will go after police if they shoot someone that pulls a gun on them, if it is
[31:45.560 --> 31:49.560]  a white cop and a black guy that is getting shot to create division.
[31:49.560 --> 31:53.360]  But when a black cop kills an innocent black guy, there is no news, when a white cop tackles
[31:53.360 --> 31:56.360]  a black guy for not wearing a mask, it is okay.
[31:56.360 --> 32:06.680]  The media selectively is terrorizing the police so that they will go under their control.
[32:06.680 --> 32:09.960]  We had a caller into the show yesterday that just a few minutes made a lot of really good
[32:09.960 --> 32:10.960]  points.
[32:10.960 --> 32:16.080]  Ron in Florida is a former NYPD police officer, I know that he knows what he is talking about
[32:16.080 --> 32:21.120]  getting into Jade Helm, getting into the drills, getting into the license plate reading cameras,
[32:21.120 --> 32:27.480]  getting into, if they do get control of the government and they plan to purge the patriots,
[32:27.480 --> 32:30.880]  what is going to be unfolding and what is happening and getting into some of those tactics
[32:30.880 --> 32:35.840]  here in the American Civil War, that is why we have to be so vigilant, so active now before
[32:35.840 --> 32:39.520]  we get into this position, we have got to get Trump back in its life and death.
[32:39.520 --> 32:43.560]  So thanks for being with us today for a few segments, you are a smart guy, you have got
[32:43.560 --> 32:48.520]  the floor here, get into information you would like to relay to folks that the general public
[32:48.520 --> 32:49.840]  is not really aware of.
[32:49.840 --> 32:53.240]  All right, thank you Alex for having me on.
[32:53.240 --> 32:56.680]  Just want to let everybody understand what is going on, they have been doing this since
[32:56.680 --> 33:07.800]  the 90s, once George Bush claimed New World Order, it was gang music, gang member music,
[33:07.800 --> 33:13.800]  everybody shooting each other, dividing the community, racial tensions with blacks, whites,
[33:13.800 --> 33:19.440]  blacks and Hispanics, there was racial tensions in the streets of New York because of that.
[33:19.440 --> 33:24.320]  And if you were gay, you keep it private, you keep it in the closet, everybody knew
[33:24.320 --> 33:25.320]  that.
[33:25.320 --> 33:31.440]  2001, Twin Towers Fall, they come up with fusion centers.
[33:31.440 --> 33:35.000]  Everybody know what fusion center is, I hope you figure it out because you have one in
[33:35.000 --> 33:43.680]  every county, and they actually came out with a population of gay school, gay school, everybody
[33:43.680 --> 33:47.360]  is okay, come out, it's cool to be gay.
[33:47.360 --> 33:53.640]  So you see the men coming out, women coming out, and it was programmed to see how old
[33:53.640 --> 33:59.600]  are the gay people, how old are the gay women, they were old, older people, makes me know
[33:59.600 --> 34:02.360]  they are putting estrogen in the food, in the water.
[34:02.360 --> 34:09.440]  Now you have 10-year-olds that are gay, 12-year-old girls that are lesbians, and you have men
[34:09.440 --> 34:11.440]  that are docile.
[34:11.440 --> 34:16.200]  When we used to do stop and frisking in New York City, we used to do a test run, the tough
[34:16.200 --> 34:23.200]  guys, we'll stop them, we'll see what they're about, 90% of the time, they were on their
[34:23.200 --> 34:29.280]  knees, they didn't fight back, they didn't argue back, they did what they were told.
[34:29.280 --> 34:36.880]  And when we have an issue where guys are standing up, we arrest them, and then they get a shot,
[34:36.880 --> 34:40.760]  they're not supposed to tell you that.
[34:40.760 --> 34:46.960]  But this is what's going on, you look at the officers now, their testosterone are up, their
[34:46.960 --> 34:55.400]  HGH up, we're warriors, they're warriors, the men in the street now are wimps, this is
[34:55.400 --> 35:01.160]  the whole plan, we're dumbing down American men, making them sentiment, but they don't
[35:01.160 --> 35:05.440]  fight back when we take over.
[35:05.440 --> 35:08.000]  People need to wake up, they understand what's going on.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.240]  Well let's go back for a minute because it's come out in Houston and LA and other areas,
[35:12.240 --> 35:16.880]  that when you're in juvenile hall for like nothing, maybe stealing a skateboard or whatever,
[35:16.880 --> 35:22.640]  that they're giving young boys female hormones, the judges are ordering it, and then the judges
[35:22.640 --> 35:25.640]  don't want that in the news, but is that what you're talking about because we always heard
[35:25.640 --> 35:30.360]  about sterilizing sex offenders, but now what they're doing is injecting like mass loads
[35:30.360 --> 35:37.280]  of estrogen super toxic amounts that actually permanently damage young boys, and so is that
[35:37.280 --> 35:39.720]  what you were saying was going on in New York?
[35:39.720 --> 35:46.160]  That is correct, in 2005 it started, they were saying it's a TB shot check, it wasn't, if
[35:46.160 --> 35:49.800]  you was combative, you know when you get in to give you a TB shot to make sure you're
[35:49.800 --> 35:53.800]  okay, if you have it or not, but when you're combative, they send you to the medic and
[35:53.800 --> 35:59.000]  they'll say, well, we have to check you again for TB and there's an estrogen shot.
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.280]  Then you see, you don't see rights in prisons, Alex.
[36:02.280 --> 36:07.000]  When you go out to the streets, you don't see guys fighting fist fighting anymore, fighting
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  for a purpose.
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.240]  And you just hit the key, when I grew up in Dallas, it was the end of males being males,
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.000]  there was constant fights, and you know it's carting down, it said, we've been paid after
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.480]  World War II to end war, and the answer was in men.
[36:20.480 --> 36:23.920]  They officially said that and that's what all of us is.
[36:23.920 --> 36:29.960]  Now you look at the men now, look down the street, you see guys with guts, women boobs,
[36:29.960 --> 36:35.560]  and when you tell them to say something or you talk to the wise or you yank on the wise,
[36:35.560 --> 36:36.560]  they stay in back.
[36:36.560 --> 36:41.760]  They don't protect their children and kids, so this is what the New World Order needs.
[36:41.760 --> 36:44.760]  And now I just showed articles, I just showed a headline, put that back up guys, good show,
[36:44.760 --> 36:48.640]  man, they're now going, oh, we give young boys estrogen shots, and you find out it's
[36:48.640 --> 36:52.760]  like a hundred times the normal amount they'd even do, you know, for a girl who doesn't
[36:52.760 --> 36:56.600]  have enough hormones and it literally creates a sterilization effect.
[36:56.600 --> 36:59.120]  So they're just getting it out in the open, aren't they?
[36:59.120 --> 37:00.120]  That's correct.
[37:00.120 --> 37:03.840]  You know, I find it confident before we're not supposed to say anything, but I'm not
[37:03.840 --> 37:10.080]  going to live too long, I have a sickness, I'm just deaf, bad confession, but it is what
[37:10.080 --> 37:19.240]  it is, what they're doing is taking over and it's real for humanity, America, I feel sorry
[37:19.240 --> 37:20.240]  for the people.
[37:20.240 --> 37:24.760]  I do too, I have a great feeling of sorrow brother, I mean, there's no reason to go through
[37:24.760 --> 37:28.760]  this and it's not that women are bad, but Hitler said first you get the women, then
[37:28.760 --> 37:30.440]  you got the children, so follow them in.
[37:30.440 --> 37:34.680]  They target women with the brainwashing and they think they're virtuous wearing the mask,
[37:34.680 --> 37:37.160]  and they're going to be virtuous and give their kids the shots, even though their kids
[37:37.160 --> 37:41.200]  are going to get sick and die, they just aren't going to stop because they're followers.
[37:41.200 --> 37:42.720]  Correct.
[37:42.720 --> 37:47.600]  So they know there's only less than maybe 2% of men in the United States are actually
[37:47.600 --> 37:48.600]  going to fight back.
[37:48.600 --> 37:53.680]  I was with some special guys from overseas, you'd be very surprised how many overseas
[37:53.680 --> 37:57.920]  people are here working with the local police department.
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.320]  They don't say that they're part of the United Nations, but I don't know why we're training
[38:02.320 --> 38:10.160]  Russian police and Turkey police in the United States, ensuring them areas and having them
[38:10.160 --> 38:11.160]  drive PD cars.
[38:11.160 --> 38:16.840]  It's very interesting, but I'm not supposed to say that, but I don't care, like I said,
[38:16.840 --> 38:17.840]  but it's...
[38:17.840 --> 38:21.480]  Well, start telling us, because a lot of this is actually known, it's just the public
[38:21.480 --> 38:22.480]  doesn't know.
[38:22.480 --> 38:25.360]  I mean, tell people years ago when you were in, what was being prepared, because it's
[38:25.360 --> 38:29.840]  like, I mean, even by the middle of Obama's term, he said, we have the military ready
[38:29.840 --> 38:33.600]  to take on constitutionalists and we're going to use the United Nations forces to do it.
[38:33.600 --> 38:34.600]  That's been...
[38:34.600 --> 38:38.400]  And now the UN runs strong cities to take over the police and their cover will be race
[38:38.400 --> 38:40.680]  riots claiming it's for black people.
[38:40.680 --> 38:43.960]  Of course, there's nothing to do with black people, it's about a world government takeover.
[38:43.960 --> 38:44.960]  Correct.
[38:44.960 --> 38:50.280]  Every time we train five years out for what's going to happen in the next five years, that's
[38:50.280 --> 38:51.920]  how you do it.
[38:51.920 --> 38:58.240]  So in 2010, we were training and that's when Jake Helm and all this stuff was going on.
[38:58.240 --> 39:05.720]  They had us drive and escorting special units that didn't really speak good English.
[39:05.720 --> 39:12.320]  But they're wearing tactical gear, armed, and I'm thinking to myself, why we...
[39:12.320 --> 39:13.880]  And who the hell are these guys?
[39:13.880 --> 39:21.080]  Well, we have to drive around in the cities, make pit stops in the house, do a dry run,
[39:21.080 --> 39:25.200]  bring them to the courthouse, and why we bring these people to the courthouse.
[39:25.200 --> 39:27.600]  It wasn't an actual purpose, it was just...
[39:27.600 --> 39:31.600]  They're practicing putting people in the helicopter and sending them to a UN base, which we all
[39:31.600 --> 39:34.560]  actually have been declassified, but you are on the ground witnessing this.
[39:34.560 --> 39:36.560]  We come back, let's talk about that, because what they're going to have is they're going
[39:36.560 --> 39:39.760]  to claim Antifa is going and killing all the patriots.
[39:39.760 --> 39:42.680]  But really, they've got trained outside mercenary teams.
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.120]  I told you this years ago, but even top White House advisor Caputo came out two weeks ago
[39:47.120 --> 39:50.200]  and said they've got special hit teams from the UN inside the US.
[39:50.200 --> 39:55.440]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks, they've been planning this for a while.
[39:55.440 --> 40:01.080]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election, but I need to be honest with
[40:01.080 --> 40:02.080]  everybody.
[40:02.080 --> 40:06.520]  The Democrats and their deep-state controllers, Communist Chinese, have come out and said they're
[40:06.520 --> 40:07.520]  going to contest the election.
[40:07.520 --> 40:09.840]  They know that Trump's going to win a landslide.
[40:09.840 --> 40:14.400]  And the destabilization that that's going to cause is going to further destroy the markets
[40:14.400 --> 40:15.400]  and the economy.
[40:15.400 --> 40:20.000]  And going into the future, even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election,
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.840]  the Democrats have said they're going to break away politically and culturally into the blue
[40:25.840 --> 40:31.720]  states and blue cities and basically use that as a pretext of sabotage, the republic
[40:31.720 --> 40:32.720]  even more.
[40:32.720 --> 40:38.640]  So, until this cancer is rooted out, until these criminals that work with foreign governments
[40:38.640 --> 40:43.000]  that are trying to basically destroy the country are punished and removed, it's just going
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  to continue to happen.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.800]  And so that's the big problem here, that is that we have systemic dug-in corruption by
[40:49.800 --> 40:54.320]  people that hate the country's very existence.
[40:54.320 --> 41:03.640]  It's the evening of September 26, 2020, and I just got done watching the horrible footage
[41:03.640 --> 41:10.480]  of thousands of riot police with trojans beating thousands of peaceful people in Trafalgar's
[41:10.480 --> 41:16.240]  Square protesting the COVID-19 martial law lockdown.
[41:16.240 --> 41:21.240]  When Iron Curtain is descending over the world from the United Nations, even more evil than
[41:21.240 --> 41:27.000]  the old Soviet Union, and it's model is communist China, we're not facing incremental tyranny,
[41:27.000 --> 41:34.760]  we're facing absolute 100% commitment to evil because the system thinks we're weak and
[41:34.760 --> 41:37.280]  thinks we're stupid and it's making us move.
[41:37.280 --> 41:40.840]  And whether it's Australia, the U.K. or the U.S., Black Lives Matter funded by Soros can
[41:40.840 --> 41:44.880]  run around and kill cops and burn things down and they're heroes, and oh, nobody's worried
[41:44.880 --> 41:49.080]  about the COVID BS, but when it's patriots saying we have rights, we have dignity, they
[42:14.880 --> 42:25.080]  have the electronic straightjacket in place.
[42:25.080 --> 42:29.280]  They are on record that they will bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and
[42:29.280 --> 42:31.480]  your family and worse.
[42:31.480 --> 42:36.760]  Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations actually give people polio and actually
[42:36.760 --> 42:38.840]  give people cancer.
[42:38.840 --> 42:40.640]  Most cancer is viral.
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.520]  That's a big secret, but the secret is beginning to come out.
[42:44.520 --> 42:47.400]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[42:47.400 --> 42:52.960]  Remember all of these banned videos and reports are banned out of video, but only you can
[42:52.960 --> 42:55.400]  share them and save humanity.
[42:55.400 --> 42:58.600]  I've got some bad news for you, then I've got some really bad news, and then I've got
[42:58.600 --> 43:00.320]  some good news.
[43:00.320 --> 43:04.800]  The bad news is, even if Trump gets reelected, they're going to still trigger attempts at
[43:04.800 --> 43:08.680]  martial law, medical lockdowns, race riots, and a depression.
[43:08.680 --> 43:11.560]  That's the globalists, they're trying to bring America to our knees.
[43:11.560 --> 43:16.320]  Now, if Trump doesn't get elected, they're still planning to bring us to our knees and
[43:16.320 --> 43:21.200]  really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression, total control,
[43:21.200 --> 43:25.360]  and like Australia is already doing, rounding up and arresting people that criticize what
[43:25.360 --> 43:27.040]  the left are doing.
[43:27.040 --> 43:28.040]  That's the really bad news.
[43:28.040 --> 43:32.040]  The good news is, this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world and
[43:32.040 --> 43:35.480]  the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking.
[43:35.480 --> 43:40.280]  So bottom line, we're in the fight, we're starting to win, but it's serious, so pray
[43:40.280 --> 43:45.280]  to God for a global awakening, support InfoWars, spread the word, and buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.120]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep InfoWars sale happening right now.
[43:50.120 --> 43:52.120]  Please visit InfoWarsTour and keep us on air.
[43:52.120 --> 43:55.120]  Thanks so much.
[43:55.120 --> 44:16.040]  All right, welcome back on this live Thursday, October 1st transmission, 32 days after the
[44:16.040 --> 44:17.040]  election.
[44:17.040 --> 44:22.240]  We're talking to a retired police officer, says he's got a terminal illness, Ron in Florida,
[44:22.240 --> 44:26.640]  I just know that he was talking about what he was saying was dead on from information
[44:26.640 --> 44:27.640]  I have.
[44:27.640 --> 44:29.640]  So I thought he'd be an informative person to have on with this, but I want to explain
[44:29.640 --> 44:31.140]  what happened.
[44:31.140 --> 44:35.240]  The Carnegie Foundation, after World War II, they were doing some of it before, but after
[44:35.240 --> 44:41.240]  World War II, they said, we've been tasked with freedom from war.
[44:41.240 --> 44:42.240]  And that was the project.
[44:42.240 --> 44:46.520]  So they wrote a bunch of reports on it, most of those are public, and they just said, we'll
[44:46.520 --> 44:53.120]  use chemicals in the water to make men docile, and we'll put women in charge of society kind
[44:53.120 --> 44:57.160]  of in the phase out, and then we'll just lower human population down to a very manageable
[44:57.160 --> 44:58.160]  500 million.
[44:58.160 --> 45:03.040]  So that's the official numbers you see today from the UN.
[45:03.040 --> 45:07.960]  But then they try to stir up actual wars at the same time as the pretext to come in and
[45:07.960 --> 45:08.960]  take control.
[45:08.960 --> 45:13.480]  So really, it's just an evolutionary takeover of human society, which Aldous Huxley wrote
[45:13.480 --> 45:19.360]  about in Brave New World in 1932, which before he died in 1961, he said was the actual plant,
[45:19.360 --> 45:21.920]  where they use chemicals again to do this.
[45:21.920 --> 45:27.000]  That's why they were pushing for all births to be cesarean, no mother's nurse.
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.240]  All of this is taking control of the human process, like Monsanto does with seeds and
[45:31.240 --> 45:35.640]  the Terminator genes, so that you don't ever have a plant that can produce more plants.
[45:35.640 --> 45:37.960]  It's patenting life, it's ending life as we know it.
[45:37.960 --> 45:44.880]  But if you look at State Department Random 7277 from 1962, it says, well disarm police
[45:44.880 --> 45:49.600]  departments, disarm the U.S. military, and incrementally bring in a UN force and train
[45:49.600 --> 45:51.760]  police to accept it.
[45:51.760 --> 45:54.280]  And so this has just been the ongoing program.
[45:54.280 --> 45:57.160]  Trump's come in and disrupted that, but this is here.
[45:57.160 --> 46:00.960]  So Ron in Florida, please continue with what you witnessed and what you saw and what you
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.960]  want to impart to the listeners.
[46:04.960 --> 46:11.240]  We prepared Watcher 6, everybody, they're here, they're in the United States.
[46:11.240 --> 46:15.160]  They're building container ships in small communities in rural areas.
[46:15.160 --> 46:17.680]  I've seen them with my own eyes.
[46:17.680 --> 46:24.080]  Florida has the biggest population of retired veterans, police departments, veterans, military
[46:24.080 --> 46:25.960]  veterans.
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.800]  And if you look at the small towns that's there that they live in, they're building container
[46:30.800 --> 46:34.880]  shipyards in decommissioned tracks, right, Alex?
[46:34.880 --> 46:46.360]  And no coincidence, the name of these companies are, just saying it, 1776, 1775.
[46:46.360 --> 46:52.920]  You know, 1991, these are the names of these container companies.
[46:52.920 --> 47:00.000]  You do a little background check, they're all registered in Hong Kong.
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.760]  You ask yourself why we need container ships in the middle of nowhere, we're no seaport,
[47:04.760 --> 47:05.760]  there's nothing around.
[47:05.760 --> 47:09.480]  I've seen them with my own eyes, they're doing it now.
[47:09.480 --> 47:14.640]  You can look up these companies, they're around in Florida, they're starting up now,
[47:14.640 --> 47:18.320]  and it has to be done within three months, they're saying.
[47:18.320 --> 47:19.320]  So they're getting ready.
[47:19.320 --> 47:25.120]  There's been a bunch of bust of Chinese shipping in, automatic weapons and rocket launchers,
[47:25.120 --> 47:27.640]  that's even come out here and there in the news.
[47:27.640 --> 47:28.640]  Correct.
[47:28.640 --> 47:31.400]  So who owns the Chinese ports in California?
[47:31.400 --> 47:33.360]  I mean, China.
[47:33.360 --> 47:38.240]  The American wonders why they're not getting any ammo coming in.
[47:38.240 --> 47:41.440]  They're controlling everything, what's coming in.
[47:41.440 --> 47:46.640]  And American people that understand, they're disarming all outside of borders of the United
[47:46.640 --> 47:47.640]  States.
[47:47.640 --> 47:52.440]  New Jersey, New York, California, because in World War II, Japan couldn't invade the
[47:52.440 --> 47:56.000]  United States because everybody had a gun, it would be a thousand year war.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.440]  Admiral Yamamoto said we've awakened a sleeping giant, there will be a rifle behind every
[48:00.440 --> 48:02.840]  blade of grass that we try to invade.
[48:02.840 --> 48:03.840]  Correct.
[48:03.840 --> 48:09.600]  So why they're not doing gun control or minimal magazines in the middle of America?
[48:09.600 --> 48:16.080]  No, they're doing it outside in the borders, California, now Texas, Florida, they try to
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.880]  do the nine round magazine ban or whatever extended magazine ban.
[48:21.880 --> 48:23.640]  But people got to understand, look what's around us.
[48:23.640 --> 48:27.560]  We're all surrounded by communist countries, the communities, Panama.
[48:27.560 --> 48:32.120]  They've already taken the West and East Coast, they're already collapsing the economies
[48:32.120 --> 48:33.120]  there.
[48:33.120 --> 48:34.120]  They're already pushing their people in.
[48:34.120 --> 48:35.360]  No, you're right, sir.
[48:35.360 --> 48:37.520]  This is a scientific long-term plan.
[48:37.520 --> 48:42.280]  Remember what the weathermen said they would do, plunge the U.S. economy, bankrupt things.
[48:42.280 --> 48:45.880]  Once civil war started as a race war, they would then bring in Chinese troops.
[48:45.880 --> 48:50.000]  That's Larry Grathwald infiltrated them in the 60s, and that was their plan then.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.600]  And now they're trying, and they said they would kill between 25 and 50 million Americans.
[48:55.600 --> 48:58.240]  And that was that number that they planned to put us in these camps.
[48:58.240 --> 49:02.080]  And now they say they're gonna use COVID as the cover of why you're disappeared.
[49:02.080 --> 49:05.520]  And most neighbors will submit when you're drug-a-way because they believe it's COVID.
[49:05.520 --> 49:07.280]  I mean, they're really trying it.
[49:07.280 --> 49:11.240]  Only Trump exposing it, only us admitting how much trouble we're in is gonna stop this.
[49:11.240 --> 49:13.160]  This is, they're making their move, folks.
[49:13.160 --> 49:14.160]  They're making their move.
[49:14.160 --> 49:15.160]  Yeah.
[49:15.160 --> 49:16.160]  Just give your heads up, Alex.
[49:16.160 --> 49:17.160]  I don't do hearsay stuff.
[49:17.160 --> 49:18.160]  I'll tell you how it is.
[49:18.160 --> 49:22.720]  We had a guy in one of our teams that does special operations with the United States
[49:22.720 --> 49:24.840]  government.
[49:24.840 --> 49:30.040]  And he worked at the border, and he came back to the unit after three months.
[49:30.040 --> 49:31.040]  He came back.
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.920]  He wasn't allowed to talk and stuff without, you know, we're hanging out, we're close
[49:34.920 --> 49:35.920]  friends with him.
[49:35.920 --> 49:42.640]  He comes and tells us, he goes, you guys know where they put the wall up, these American
[49:42.640 --> 49:43.640]  people are stupid.
[49:43.640 --> 49:44.640]  And I said, why?
[49:44.640 --> 49:45.640]  Yeah.
[49:45.640 --> 49:46.640]  They keep the immigrants.
[49:46.640 --> 49:48.640]  He goes, no, no, no.
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.480]  He goes, dude, there's Chinese troops in Mexico.
[49:54.480 --> 49:55.680]  They're in Mexico.
[49:55.680 --> 49:56.800]  There's troops in Mexico.
[49:56.800 --> 49:58.680]  They have a camp down there.
[49:58.680 --> 49:59.880]  And I said, what?
[49:59.880 --> 50:01.320]  Go away.
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.360]  He goes, listen, guys, I never lied to you guys, you know, this is top secret stuff you
[50:05.360 --> 50:09.280]  guys are not supposed to notice.
[50:09.280 --> 50:12.840]  And the cartels are helping them.
[50:12.840 --> 50:15.200]  And listen, I have family that's been in the military.
[50:15.200 --> 50:17.400]  They're out now, but 35 plus years.
[50:17.400 --> 50:21.280]  They were with the State Department 10 years ago and said that, I mean, China is admittedly
[50:21.280 --> 50:24.560]  moving into Latin America, Africa, you name it.
[50:24.560 --> 50:30.320]  They have these development zones and these inland ports is what China calls it.
[50:30.320 --> 50:35.080]  They're building a giant highway up from the Pacific side all the way up to Texas.
[50:35.080 --> 50:39.840]  And yes, there are, what I've heard, hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops in plain clothes
[50:39.840 --> 50:41.840]  in Mexico.
[50:41.840 --> 50:42.840]  That is correct.
[50:42.840 --> 50:43.840]  And they do have a camp.
[50:43.840 --> 50:49.600]  And now, I don't know if you guys know that Russia is building military equipment in Mexico
[50:49.600 --> 50:52.280]  for the first time.
[50:52.280 --> 50:54.040]  Can you look that up?
[50:54.040 --> 50:58.560]  Russia is building ammunition and tanks in Mexico.
[50:58.560 --> 51:01.200]  It was in the news in Mexico.
[51:01.200 --> 51:02.400]  Now he brought this to my attention.
[51:02.400 --> 51:04.640]  I had no idea this was happening.
[51:04.640 --> 51:08.200]  So now I understand why if Trump comes out and says, Hey, we're building a world because
[51:08.200 --> 51:12.240]  there's foreign troops on the other side ready to invade the United States, they'll say the
[51:12.240 --> 51:13.240]  25th Amendment.
[51:13.240 --> 51:14.240]  They'll say he's crazy.
[51:14.240 --> 51:15.240]  Get them out of here.
[51:15.240 --> 51:17.240]  He knows what's going on.
[51:17.240 --> 51:23.080]  It's very sad that America is so under attack and the average American has been taught to
[51:23.080 --> 51:24.440]  hate their own country.
[51:24.440 --> 51:26.680]  It's like we almost deserve it, Ron.
[51:26.680 --> 51:27.680]  Correct.
[51:27.680 --> 51:29.560]  I say the same thing.
[51:29.560 --> 51:32.440]  Nobody has love in humanity anymore.
[51:32.440 --> 51:37.520]  They still, they got these fusion centers, Alex, they're tracing everything, what everybody
[51:37.520 --> 51:41.880]  does in every community, everything you're saying, and they're making a list of you.
[51:41.880 --> 51:45.240]  And they know what, when you go to the shooting range, because I went to the shooting range
[51:45.240 --> 51:51.000]  down here and what is the long hold, there's a plate reader on the trees.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.280]  And I said, and ask the guy, what's this for?
[51:53.280 --> 51:55.240]  He was all, I didn't put that there.
[51:55.240 --> 51:58.240]  Why is there a plate reader in the shooting range?
[51:58.240 --> 52:02.600]  Because they're keeping track of all the active shooters, the guys that go, that's right.
[52:02.600 --> 52:03.600]  That's right.
[52:03.600 --> 52:07.720]  And why no one doesn't baseball bat it, why the cops go along, why we all just go along
[52:07.720 --> 52:10.440]  with the globalist takeover.
[52:10.440 --> 52:11.760]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[52:11.760 --> 52:12.760]  God bless you, sir.
[52:12.760 --> 52:14.240]  Anything else you'd like to add, Ron?
[52:14.240 --> 52:19.160]  Yeah, I just want to say, Alex, and I'm going to say through the guys that have been doing
[52:19.160 --> 52:24.000]  this, I'm going to give a stern warning to the Patriots and the people of America.
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.080]  And I'm going to say this from the other side of me working.
[52:28.080 --> 52:33.480]  And I'm going to disinvolve what I was involved with for eternity, but I'm going to say it.
[52:33.480 --> 52:36.280]  American people, I'm going to put it to you how it is.
[52:36.280 --> 52:37.280]  Point blank.
[52:37.280 --> 52:38.280]  We're coming for you.
[52:38.280 --> 52:39.280]  We're going to get you.
[52:39.280 --> 52:42.440]  And we're going to get the Patriots.
[52:42.440 --> 52:44.200]  This is them talking.
[52:44.200 --> 52:45.200]  This is how they talk.
[52:45.200 --> 52:47.200]  And they're going to squash you.
[52:47.200 --> 52:54.040]  Let them wake up, pay attention, watch your six, get your testosterone checked, and get
[52:54.040 --> 52:57.840]  ready to fight and protect your family because they are coming.
[52:57.840 --> 53:00.160]  They are coming to get you.
[53:00.160 --> 53:01.160]  And God bless America.
[53:01.160 --> 53:03.080]  And thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[53:03.080 --> 53:04.080]  Thank you.
[53:04.080 --> 53:05.080]  God bless you, sir.
[53:05.080 --> 53:09.320]  A smart guy, and he's absolutely right, that they were training with foreign military under
[53:09.320 --> 53:15.360]  a UN contract under Dincor and others to arrest American patriots under the UN and extraditus.
[53:15.360 --> 53:19.320]  And now you notice the UN is trying to charge U.S. troops with war crimes, and the Pentagon
[53:19.320 --> 53:20.480]  and Trump have been threatening them.
[53:20.480 --> 53:24.840]  I mean, this is a world government takeover, and they've got their people inside the U.S.
[53:24.840 --> 53:28.640]  Okay, I'm going to go to break a bunch of big news breaking next hour, a bunch of guests
[53:28.640 --> 53:30.520]  separately.
[53:30.520 --> 53:34.800]  We can't get eight-pack power stack, two different packs, A.M.P. impact, 13 pills a day.
[53:34.800 --> 53:38.840]  You want to supercharge your body, your energy, your libido, your stamina, weight loss, all
[53:38.840 --> 53:39.840]  of it.
[53:39.840 --> 53:40.960]  We can't get this anymore.
[53:40.960 --> 53:46.320]  We've only got, at current sales rates, a 14-day supply, and it's gone forever.
[53:46.320 --> 53:50.600]  Get your eight-pack power stack, that's 60% off, and with free shipping, that's very
[53:50.600 --> 53:53.640]  close to cost, at infowarstore.com.
[53:53.640 --> 53:56.840]  And separately, they have a new special on high-quality swarble food, which they're ready
[53:56.840 --> 54:00.680]  to ship out to you before the big shortages, we believe, that are coming, and before food
[54:00.680 --> 54:06.960]  prices go up, which they already admit start to happen, and prepare with Alex.com.
[54:06.960 --> 54:10.200]  It runs through next Monday, and then that's the last special they can do for a while because
[54:10.200 --> 54:11.560]  they never discount.
[54:11.560 --> 54:12.560]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[54:12.560 --> 54:13.560]  It's my Patriot.
[54:13.560 --> 54:16.480]  This is a special three-month food supply, $150 off.
[54:16.480 --> 54:17.480]  That's huge.
[54:17.480 --> 54:23.040]  300 off a six-month, 600 off a one-year supply, and more, at preparewithalex.com.
[54:23.040 --> 54:24.200]  Get ready now.
[54:24.200 --> 54:25.200]  This is real.
[54:25.200 --> 54:28.840]  You need provisions, you need food, you need water filtration, they've got the best.
[54:28.840 --> 54:33.600]  At prepareitwithalex.com, infowarstore.com, the eight-pack power stack, well, you can
[54:33.600 --> 54:34.600]  still get it.
[54:34.600 --> 54:37.840]  Whatever you do, though, pray for a great awakening and spread the word.
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.200]  We'll be right back with our number two, and many other special guests, like John Rabaport,
[54:43.200 --> 54:44.200]  Allie Alexander, Paul Grant Roberts.
[54:44.200 --> 54:48.840]  The way the psychological warfare operation works is very, very simple.
[54:48.840 --> 54:53.080]  They give you about freedoms by increments, always promising it's only going to be a short
[54:53.080 --> 54:58.240]  period of time, and then the restrictions will be released, but they're not.
[54:58.240 --> 55:03.200]  They have a significant amount of time, always four or five times longer than what they said.
[55:03.200 --> 55:08.000]  They will then slightly release it a little bit, only tighten it down even more later.
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.080]  This is called successive approximation, incrementalism, or the inchworm effect.
[55:14.080 --> 55:18.520]  This is the most common way that the Salaterians take over, but there then becomes a point
[55:18.520 --> 55:20.720]  where the public wakes up.
[55:20.720 --> 55:24.760]  Under the incrementalism, it starts resisting, and then there's usually a giant purge, and
[55:24.760 --> 55:29.600]  a clamp down, and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days, weeks, or months
[55:29.600 --> 55:31.360]  that you saw in the previous 10 years.
[55:31.360 --> 55:37.880]  And that's the period we're in globally right now, the world government, chai combat, globalist
[55:37.880 --> 55:42.800]  corporate takeover of the planet, that once you pour an absolutely sick under their thumb
[55:42.800 --> 55:45.920]  forever.
[55:45.920 --> 55:51.280]  This is your last chance to get a packed power stack, and I'm really bummed out about that.
[55:51.280 --> 55:55.440]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and sort
[55:55.440 --> 55:59.040]  of reordering it, they spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[55:59.040 --> 56:03.600]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown, and because there's 13 different formulas
[56:03.600 --> 56:08.040]  in a packed power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[56:08.040 --> 56:13.480]  This is the highest end AMPM pack system you're going to find, where you take half the pills
[56:13.480 --> 56:16.560]  in the morning, half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night.
[56:16.560 --> 56:17.560]  It's amazing.
[56:17.560 --> 56:20.760]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to
[56:20.760 --> 56:24.400]  take it, and that's why it's having such a great effect, because the stuff in here is
[56:24.400 --> 56:25.400]  absolutely amazing.
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.040]  This is your last chance to get a packed power stack at infowarstore.com, it's 60% off and
[56:30.040 --> 56:34.080]  free shipping, that is at cost for all of you that already support InfoWars, we're passing
[56:34.080 --> 56:38.360]  these savings on to you, get your 8-pack power stack now or you still can, last chance to
[56:38.360 --> 56:48.200]  get it, infowarstore.com, 8-pack power stack, 60% off and free shipping.
[56:48.200 --> 57:05.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:05.560 --> 57:09.200]  Well we do know about history biology, we know what's going on, I'm Alex Jones, we have
[57:09.200 --> 57:13.520]  a special guest joining us next segment with huge COVID-19 news, but here's Larry Grath
[57:13.520 --> 57:19.120]  Walde, the Green Beret, being recruited at Columbia to take over the US, bring in the
[57:19.120 --> 57:24.000]  Chinese and put 50 million Americans in death camps and kill 25 million of us.
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.520]  Adjusted for numbers today, that'd be about 45 million they'd kill.
[57:27.520 --> 57:33.440]  Here's the report, these people are now in charge.
[57:33.440 --> 57:38.480]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[57:38.480 --> 57:49.320]  You know we become responsible then for administrating 250 million people and there was no answers.
[57:49.320 --> 57:54.000]  No one had given any thought to economics, how are you going to clothe and feed these
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.000]  people.
[57:55.000 --> 58:00.200]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese
[58:00.200 --> 58:05.560]  and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United
[58:05.560 --> 58:06.560]  States.
[58:06.560 --> 58:11.640]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called
[58:11.640 --> 58:19.160]  the counter-revolution and they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded
[58:19.160 --> 58:27.320]  against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest where we would take
[58:27.320 --> 58:34.480]  all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them
[58:34.480 --> 58:36.560]  how things were going to be.
[58:36.560 --> 58:41.200]  I asked well what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate that are
[58:41.200 --> 58:49.200]  die-hard capitalists and the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated and when I pursued
[58:49.200 --> 58:54.640]  this further they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these
[58:54.640 --> 59:01.360]  re-education centers and when I say eliminate I mean kill, 25 million people.
[59:01.360 --> 59:10.680]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have graduate degrees
[59:10.680 --> 59:20.560]  from Columbia and other well-known educational centers and hear them figuring out the logistics
[59:20.560 --> 59:25.920]  for the elimination of 25 million people and they were dead serious.
[59:25.920 --> 59:37.840]  Like you and me to let the FDA know that this is completely insane because the FDA is the
[59:37.840 --> 59:44.240]  agency that's going to be providing what's called emergency authorization for this vaccine
[59:44.240 --> 59:51.320]  to be shot into 350 million people in the United States and perhaps many other people
[59:51.320 --> 59:55.640]  in other countries as well.
[59:55.640 --> 59:58.200]  I hope you're getting what I'm saying here.
[59:58.200 --> 1:00:02.280]  By the way John I'm sitting here while you're talking and I never interrupt you.
[1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:05.200]  This is so bombshell and I read this you're right.
[1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:09.000]  They're admitting that the vaccine is only for something that doesn't basically exist
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:12.360]  somebody that doesn't actually get sick because they're going to keep calling flus and everything
[1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:13.360]  COVID-19.
[1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:18.360]  They're admitting that it's for something that doesn't even kill you so that they never
[1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:21.000]  get judged on the fact that other people die.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.280]  They're admitting it's worthless because it's based on a whole fraud anyways.
[1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:27.680]  So at the base level this totally discredits it.
[1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:32.840]  This is just this is incredible sorry to interrupt but you've got to join us tomorrow.
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:38.600]  Yeah it's unbelievable absolutely unbelievable and I'm trying to spread the word about this
[1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:45.440]  so people would be motivated to contact the FDA and warn them that we're watching we're
[1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:48.720]  on notice we're putting you on notice FDA.
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:01:04.120]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:19.440]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:26.840]  The great awakening is here go to banned.video download the videos and share.
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:37.920]  The information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:54.040]  Infowars.com only you can stop the books only you.
[1:01:54.040 --> 1:02:02.440]  Hello my name is Dr. Fauci and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years and I've overseen
[1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:09.640]  well you know the AIDS pandemic and so many other things and I take my orders from Bill
[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:16.920]  Gates Dr. Bill Gates I mean he's not a doctor but he controls everything you do and he now
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:22.760]  says you're going to take the shots and of course in England they are now saying what
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:29.200]  I told you you will not be allowed to travel leave your home until you take all the shots
[1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:36.920]  Dr. Gates I mean Bill Gates your owner your master says you will have to take four to
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:45.520]  five COVID shots a year for adult two for baby here baby me much more manageable just
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:57.160]  like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine remind you that we owe you big brother mainstream
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:04.800]  media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny will so does he live from the info
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:13.320]  wars.com studios it's Alex Jones so first the president gets set that oh stay in your
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:17.960]  house 15 days the hospitals are gonna be overwhelmed flatten the curve and then it's two months
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:22.840]  and six months in a year and two years and now CNN came out today it's also an MSNBC
[1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:27.840]  it's everywhere oh it's never gonna end we never stop wearing mask again and oh you're
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:31.440]  gonna have a tracker app and oh you're gonna have a social credit score everything we warned
[1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:36.840]  you about it's now official of course we knew was in Rockefeller lockstep was an event 201
[1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:41.480]  they have this all pre-planned now it's in mainstream news that China China's global
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:46.560]  lockdown propaganda campaign they're open for business we're not tablet magazine lawyer
[1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:51.000]  in a big science research group got all the examples of them staging people's deaths people
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:57.960]  falling down all of it to create hysteria is COVID itself a hoax no it's a weak virus
[1:03:57.960 --> 1:04:02.360]  it's a man made some gates can own it but everything around it's a hoax the death numbers
[1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:10.520]  that the false positives all of it but now there's this this came out today we're gonna
[1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:16.080]  play the video in a moment governor Cuomo claims coronavirus patients were never sent
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:22.800]  to nursing homes even though he and his criminal attorney general Leticia James the Soros minion
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:30.040]  we have press conferences are like you will go there we're defending it and it's an order
[1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:35.280]  but notice they've removed the executive order off the website but everybody has it saved
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:44.240]  Department of Health New York Governor Cuomo ordering it there it is right there coronavirus
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:51.320]  spreads in New York nursing homes forced to take recovering patients April 25th NBC News
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:56.440]  let's continue New York will no longer require nursing homes to take COVID-19 patients from
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:00.320]  hospitals he reversed the order months later after most of the deaths of New York were from
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:05.280]  that May 11th remember though he says that never happened now New York's true nursing home death
[1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:09.480]  toll cloaked in secrecy and they started making it secret numbers are it's probably double
[1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:17.840]  probably 12,000 that's August 11th a license for neglect nursing homes and it goes on Cuomo
[1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:23.600]  says transfer of COVID patients from hospitals and nursing homes never happened now even
[1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:35.200]  though it's on record it did 6,300 nursing home patients 6,300 virus patients were sent
[1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:40.600]  to nursing homes AP July 6 it was a lot more than that but Cuomo now says never happened
[1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:45.960]  but he won't release the documents now he blames President Trump and I do blame President
[1:05:45.960 --> 1:05:50.720]  Trump and myself and all of us for letting these Democrat states like Michigan Pennsylvania
[1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:55.600]  do this to get rid of old people and drive up the COVID numbers they so desperately needed
[1:05:55.600 --> 1:06:03.240]  so here is the first clip Cuomo administration defends early decision on nursing homes but
[1:06:03.240 --> 1:06:09.720]  now he says it never happened here it is continuing to defend his early policy of requiring nursing
[1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:15.000]  homes to accept COVID positive patients to keep space free in our hospitals will report
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:19.600]  from the Associated Press says that the state sent more than 4500 patients recovering from
[1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:24.480]  the disease to those nursing homes and at least 5700 nursing home residents have died
[1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:28.880]  with the virus the administration claims that it was doing what Washington told them to
[1:06:28.880 --> 1:06:34.320]  do a policy that the Department of Health put out was in line directly with the March
[1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:40.040]  13th directive put out by CDC and CMS that read and I quote nursing homes should admit
[1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:46.000]  any individuals from hospitals where COVID is president not could should that is President
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:51.040]  Trump's CMS and CDC so I know that there's been a lot of discussion on this topic there
[1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:55.920]  are over a dozen states that did the exact same thing all Democrat states to get the
[1:06:55.920 --> 1:07:02.080]  numbers up and yes Fauci and Gates are running Trump's CDC and NIH that's a big deal but
[1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:10.360]  here's Cuomo now saying it never happened period and we never needed nursing home beds because
[1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:17.800]  we always had hospital beds so it just never happened in New York where we needed to say
[1:07:17.800 --> 1:07:26.160]  to a nursing home we need you to take this person COVID positive it never happened we
[1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:33.040]  had extra beds we had extra beds at Javits we had beds at emergency hospitals that we
[1:07:33.040 --> 1:07:40.520]  put up all across the state so it just never happened that we needed a nursing home to
[1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:46.800]  take a COVID positive person it never all right to decipher this and another huge COVID
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:51.040]  development next segment is John Rabaport no more fake news.com major investigative journalist
[1:07:51.040 --> 1:07:57.400]  work for some of the top TV stations in the country in news here with us now what do you
[1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:05.600]  make of this major next level flip-flop or lie what's really going on here I guess it's
[1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:15.760]  complete insanity I mean I didn't I didn't do it yes I did he did it I mean what what
[1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:21.120]  is the other there's no argument here so now he denies that it ever happened well I don't
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:29.960]  know it sounds like a psycho to me I never did what I said I had to do a hundred times
[1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:36.160]  you've got some of the articles there there's many others there's press conferences there's
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:41.440]  insistence right in the clip you played yeah we did it we put these people in nursing homes
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:47.720]  because the federal government said or White House said we had to do it so we did do it
[1:08:47.720 --> 1:08:55.720]  and then now come on so no we didn't we never did it no problem I mean you know when I just
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:09:05.320]  throw this guy out of office completely he's a total psycho well brother where does this
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:12.360]  go what do you think comes next well the vaccine comes next they're trying everything under
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:20.160]  the sun to try to fake it and prove that it's effective so they can unleash it on the people
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:28.120]  and you know I discussed it yesterday on the show how the major clinical trials are all
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:37.280]  fraud complete fraud AstraZeneca Pfizer Moderna the whole all these studies on the on a new
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:44.640]  vaccine are designed to prove that the vaccine is effective at preventing nothing in other
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:50.200]  words if you have a nothing case of illness that nobody cares about because it cures itself
[1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:56.080]  doesn't need a vaccine at all then that's what we're trying to show that the vaccine
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:10:02.760]  is effective for those cases and this is so sensational start laying it out now I mean
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:08.360]  they admit that they're saying a whole class of flu and cold is covered they've never
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:13.480]  had a vaccine for the cold they still won't and so they're admitting in the fine print
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:20.080]  it's a fraud yeah the whole thing is and not only that but you know committing a major
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:27.240]  fraud in a time of a national disaster there's a law about that it's a it's a felony it's
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:34.000]  a very serious felony and I would say there's no more sizable fraud that you could think
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  of then after declared state of emergency pandemic these vaccine companies are trying
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:46.560]  to foist a fraudulent vaccine on the public to make trillions of dollars that doesn't
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:53.720]  prevent anything I mean this is an article in the New York Times so it's not like this
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:11:00.680]  is a secret and that's it they have to hide the fraud in plain view or they're liable
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:06.360]  but if they admit the fraud up front then they're covered well they can try to be covered
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:11.280]  I mean I can see a legal case being made against them completely no I agree let's talk about
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:15.080]  the technicals of the article and how huge as we come back with a full segment but the
[1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:21.160]  next minute and a half CNN saying it's a permanent lockdown so is Bill Gates it's not going to
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:27.400]  go well why are they so desperate why are they doing this well they want to shoot everybody
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:34.920]  on the planet up with a vaccine and that vaccine is going to become increasingly toxic as far
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:40.360]  as I'm concerned they could start off with something very mild and say see it's safe
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:47.080]  nobody's having a problem and then round two everything starts to collapse they want this
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:55.080]  vaccine also here's a detail the technology called RNA technology it's an experimental
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:59.120]  type of vaccine that's never been tried before in the public it's always caused problems
[1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:06.400]  before when it's been studied I mean serious problems in people but if you use this technology
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:12.800]  you can make vaccines faster cheaper quicker less expensively this is why they want to
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:18.840]  ram through one or another of these RNA vaccines so they can say hey we finally got approval
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:25.320]  from the FDA now we can throw all kinds of vaccines and drugs as a public that we can
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:31.240]  develop in months instead of years hey good we just discovered 12 new viruses and we've
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:36.160]  got vaccines ready to go on all of them because we're using the new technology that's right
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:42.320]  this is just a rollout of total medical training and they call it a vaccine it's reproving
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:50.000]  reprogramming to sell it's franken nanotech science fiction hell we'll be right back with
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:54.880]  John Rappaport I'm Alex Jones if you look at the top tech billionaires and the big banks
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:59.680]  that finance and control them to a man and to a woman they believe there's too many people
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:03.600]  on the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain top or
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:08.720]  a national park they have to look at us the common people they have to look at the proletariat
[1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:13.400]  they have to look at the scum that's why they love the lockdown putting muzzles on us that
[1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:18.760]  gives them a big thrill controlling where we can go what we can do bankrupting main street
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:24.120]  bankrupting small towns all of it is a vertical integration consolidation so they can then
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:29.920]  dictate the terms of our total surrender which is taking sterilant vaccines day one
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:35.120]  ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over they used all the entertainment
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:40.320]  garbage to put us into a trance and now the spiders moving in for the kill you know this
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:44.760]  I know this it's all out in the open the question is what are we going to do about it well the
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:49.640]  first thing is identify the enemy identify the enemy identify the enemy identify your
[1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:55.840]  enemy now we've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:14:01.120]  it's killing millions of people via starvation but the good news is it's caused a planetary
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:08.200]  awakening as well the general public all over the planet hate Bill Gates he's the most unpopular
[1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:13.920]  person on earth people know he's not a doctor people know he's a eugenicist the population
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:19.880]  knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses polio sterilance
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:25.480]  and more it's even in the associated press so now they're beginning to understand that
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:30.920]  we the people know that there is a corporate global government and the beast top tech billionaires
[1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:36.480]  sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war scams the coronavirus scams that
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:42.280]  we're witnessing so remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:47.440]  they've done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization they are
[1:14:47.440 --> 1:15:07.880]  the enemies of humanity they want you dead you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:29.040]  we came from the west virginia coal mines and the rocky mountains and the west we can
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:39.240]  skin a buck we can run a trot line and a country boy can survive i'm alex jones your host
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:44.960]  john reports here all the news we cover is super important but the new york times in
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:49.480]  this article oh here's the three main vaccines and guess what they don't protect you they
[1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:55.200]  could never protect you from a cold they call everything a cold they call all the coveted
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:16:00.920]  cold of the flu they call all that a false positive but see then they own the virus
[1:16:00.920 --> 1:16:06.560]  itself so then they can own the patent on the vaccines that's why they did it they always
[1:16:06.560 --> 1:16:13.000]  said the holy grail was to have a cold virus vaccine but they're too diverse there's too
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:18.120]  many it doesn't work that's admitted so they just now claim all colds are covered and they
[1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:22.200]  have a solution but the fine prince says actually won't protect you john report walk
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:32.320]  through how huge this is yeah this is gigantic so they're looking at 150 cases of what they
[1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:40.040]  call coveted 19 that's going to decide the target population of 350 million people in
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:46.720]  america in other words these companies are saying if we can prove that 150 cases of mild
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:55.000]  covid can be prevented by the vaccine then we're in then we get fda authorization then
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:02.040]  everybody's happy in fact it's even less than 150 could be a hundred and of course the whole
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:07.640]  thing as we've been saying is total fraud because fda if they were honest they would
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:13.720]  say whoa whoa whoa whoa what is this vaccine actually preventing are you saying it's preventing
[1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:20.160]  something serious that can cause people to die to go to hospitals etc etc or are you
[1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:26.800]  saying it can only prevent something extremely mild that nobody cares about because it cures
[1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:31.720]  itself anyway and we don't need a vaccine for it so step up to the plate and tell us
[1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:37.160]  the truth what's the story this is what the fda would do if they were honest and if may
[1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:43.200]  be enough lawyers and scientists out there held their feet to the fire and said you're
[1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:48.520]  not going to approve this friggin vaccine because we know that it doesn't do anything
[1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:54.080]  it's a total con it's a total heist there's trillions to be made and again how it works
[1:17:54.080 --> 1:18:00.000]  is gates puts billions of his money tax exempt into other companies he owns a share of to
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:07.640]  make pure profit it's a total scam yeah absolutely yes i'm a philanthropist and i'm giving away
[1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:15.240]  all this money to these pharmaceutical companies which by the way i also happen to own a lot
[1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:20.920]  of stock in so when i give them my donations their stock price goes up and i make money
[1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:27.560]  on the other end same thing as a stock buyback that's all he's doing yeah i mean what kind
[1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:34.560]  of you know sec somebody come in here and say bill gates is a total scammer also looked
[1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:40.000]  at how much he spent in media buys promoting his foundation of their ideas it's over six
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:45.120]  billion the last five years alone he spent 200 something million just last month on good
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:50.720]  pr for himself this is incredible he's bought off the media he has he has bought off the
[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:56.080]  media completely oh i really care about you boys and girls that are covering the news
[1:18:56.080 --> 1:19:02.520]  i'm going to give you a lot of money oh you're going to take this money from a guy who has
[1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:08.960]  an agenda that means you can't criticize him you can't be on that they had a show the good
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:14.840]  doctor attacking me a drama show and at the end it said underwritten by bill amelina gates
[1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:22.840]  he's underwriting drama shows hospital shows right right that's part of the brainwashing
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:30.080]  wall-to-wall hospital doctor shows a medical shows emergency you know injury shows people
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:35.280]  wearing white coats at the scopes the whole thing wall-to-wall to completely brainwash
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:40.480]  the public into thinking life is a medical there's nothing else when i'm born i'm in
[1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:45.560]  the medical system and i stay there till i die and they do whatever they need to do
[1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:52.280]  to make me live as opposed to what would happen if i died you know if i did the whole thing
[1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:58.120]  is about making it where humans cannot independently live it's beyond investigation it's dehumanization
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:03.320]  that's their that's their goal john that is i mean they decided a long time ago the rockefeller
[1:20:03.320 --> 1:20:10.880]  people look we we're not going to just bring an army on to american soil you know and start
[1:20:10.880 --> 1:20:18.880]  just shooting people and killing people with major weapons you know wearing foreign nation
[1:20:18.880 --> 1:20:26.120]  uniforms that's not the major plan that could be here and there but the major plan is we
[1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:31.080]  have to declare a certain kind of emergency that immediately brainwashes everybody into
[1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:37.280]  thinking we're all transmitters of a disease and we all have to imprison ourselves exactly
[1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:42.760]  we're all the bad guys it's virtuous to hate ourselves and die and kill the economy and
[1:20:42.760 --> 1:20:49.560]  be under their medical training exactly it's virtuous to be a victim so here i'm volunteering
[1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:54.880]  oh yeah i'll be a medical victim do whatever you want to me because that's science and
[1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:59.760]  i'm all for science okay we're going to give you a surgery that'll probably kill you but
[1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:06.000]  it's science okay fine whatever you have to do because i'm on your side that's the whole
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:13.120]  plan the doctors are in charge the people who run the doctors are in charge the rockefeller
[1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:18.240]  empire is basically for those that don't know it's it's i've had medical doctors on you
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:21.840]  name it have read the books on it the rockefeller is about a hundred years ago took over western
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:30.080]  medicine exactly they said okay well now we need to manufacture drugs using our petroleum
[1:21:30.080 --> 1:21:36.120]  products by products and we can sell this whole idea that we have all these drugs but
[1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:40.800]  in order to sell it we have to make people afraid of the germ the germ the germ the
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:45.160]  germ the germ it's going to get you it's going to get you and brainwash people for a hundred
[1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:52.440]  years so that when they sprang this coronavirus fraud on everybody and that chinese locked
[1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:57.240]  down 50 million people whoa whoa whoa okay well i guess everybody's going to have to
[1:21:57.240 --> 1:22:04.800]  do this and people fell in line like total pods total pods wearing masks shuffling down
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:11.760]  bleak streets in deserted cities all because somebody brainwashed the population for a
[1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:17.440]  hundred years namely rockefeller to be afraid terrified of the germ the germ the germ the
[1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:23.160]  germ germ it's complete insanity it's the immune system the immune system the immune
[1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:26.480]  system that can't why do you think that he finally had to come out with the u n said
[1:22:26.480 --> 1:22:30.120]  vitamin d vitamin c zinc isn't good he had to admit okay if you don't have this he'll
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:36.720]  die i think he's been under so much pressure yeah i guess he is from so many different
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:42.120]  quarters that he feels like he has to because he's making statements all over the place
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:47.960]  he says one thing contradicts himself two days later like for example he said at a press
[1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:53.840]  conference i just want to make sure everybody understands that people with no symptoms do
[1:22:53.840 --> 1:23:02.680]  not drive epidemics they do not drive epidemics well yeah so why all the insane wall to wall
[1:23:02.680 --> 1:23:09.080]  news about how many cases of people that have just been diagnosed all of whom virtually
[1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:13.040]  have no symptoms and despite the fact they're changing the subject every five minutes and

[1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:08.200]  as day communist Chinese working in tandem with the united nations and the democratic
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:13.720]  party in the united states as well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:19.160]  to make it look like day of the dead into the world in china earlier this year then the
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:23.680]  union put out standardized rules designed to keep the west locked down when china reopened
[1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:31.440]  within three months this is the greatest strategic ever this is twenty-first century warfare
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:36.960]  being carried out psychological means for the ultimate style paul joseph watson is written
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:42.400]  about it info wars dot com myself alex jones david i know insurer covering this heavily
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:46.600]  this is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist china and the un
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:54.240]  we're behind the hysteria and perhaps most cruelly of all if donald trump has his way
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:25:02.320]  the complications of covid-19 which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:08.840]  that two hundred million people have died probably by the time i finished this talk
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:13.760]  joe biden has always been a congenital liar part of the establishment for close to fifty
[1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:21.680]  years but now boy as his brain degenerates we are seeing walking public dimension on
[1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:26.240]  the biggest stage in the world the twenty twenty election there are three hundred seventy
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:30.600]  million people in the united states if two hundred million died from covid that'd be
[1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:34.960]  more than half of the population when not even one tenth of one percent have actually
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:40.400]  died but him putting these giant lies and he's incredibly brain damaged statements
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:45.760]  out is emblematic of the general public being in a trance how is anyone even putting up
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:51.360]  with this it is beyond bizarre it was in the telecommunications act of nineteen ninety
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:57.680]  six that all new cell phones would track your gps location i read from the federal law and
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:03.120]  listeners couldn't believe me because that was unamerican now the media admits that almost

[1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:01.800]  what's exacerbating this is not just the enemy attacks it's the supply chain breakdowns you're
[1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:06.160]  getting clean supplements folks that aren't from china or whatever when things break down
[1:31:06.160 --> 1:31:10.200]  you can't get them anymore first it was a few products and six products and eight products
[1:31:10.200 --> 1:31:13.840]  and ten products then i mean this is serious and it's in the news now about the supply
[1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:17.840]  chain breakdowns but ollie alexander ollie i really appreciate you coming on with us
[1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:23.760]  today there's so much to get into you've got your great news site you've got your great
[1:31:23.760 --> 1:31:30.640]  twitter site at ali and of course founders dot ali alexander dot com and you also head
[1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:36.680]  up your culture website i know that you were critical of trumps performance i thought overall
[1:31:36.680 --> 1:31:40.040]  he won he was ganged up by two people but what would you have liked to see him do and
[1:31:40.040 --> 1:31:44.800]  then let's shift yours into now the fact that they are going to contest they're going to
[1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:50.600]  spend it the trumps contesting if he can test them and and and how much peril this republic
[1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:54.800]  center maybe maybe you think we're not in peril we really appreciate you joining us
[1:31:54.800 --> 1:31:59.520]  hey thanks alex i think you know it's been thirty six hours i think i was really hard
[1:31:59.520 --> 1:32:05.440]  on him at first and i still want to be but maybe it wasn't as bad as i thought it looks
[1:32:05.440 --> 1:32:11.160]  like a lot of people cut out halfway through the debate it was a nightmare i mean chris
[1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:17.480]  wallis has to be the worst moderator of any presidential debate i've ever seen and so
[1:32:17.480 --> 1:32:21.840]  i just think it left a lot of people with a bad taste in their mouth but look i would
[1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:26.480]  have liked the president of the united states in the middle of a presidential debate to
[1:32:26.480 --> 1:32:32.760]  talk about his presidency instead he was talking about force twigs in california so i don't
[1:32:32.760 --> 1:32:37.800]  really know what president trump was thinking there were times where he was strategic there
[1:32:37.800 --> 1:32:41.760]  were times when he was tactical and then he would let off the gas there were times when
[1:32:41.760 --> 1:32:45.880]  he was petulant there were times when he would interrupt there was times when he would defer
[1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:52.000]  it just seemed like um they either over prepared him or he was thinking about a national security
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:56.400]  matter and he was somewhere else this wasn't the best version of trump so that's what i
[1:32:56.400 --> 1:32:59.600]  would have liked to have seen i would agree that chris wallis was so annoying that it
[1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:03.400]  was very annoying to watch it's not a real debate they should have had an opening statements
[1:33:03.400 --> 1:33:07.200]  ending statements they should have had a minute at the end of everything to say whatever they
[1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:12.200]  wanted they should just be two men up their own stage going at it exactly and and and
[1:33:12.200 --> 1:33:15.880]  this is the difference and you know that and and for your listeners the difference between
[1:33:15.880 --> 1:33:21.440]  a form and a debate is a form is when the moderator has complete control and they ask
[1:33:21.440 --> 1:33:25.960]  you questions and you answer them and you're talking to the moderator that's right this
[1:33:25.960 --> 1:33:30.920]  was a forum this was not a debate when the league and douglas debates there was no moderator
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:36.120]  they went out what 15 hours yeah they could have slugged each other and the and the crowd
[1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:41.400]  would have enjoyed it and so the interaction that uh that former vice president joe biden
[1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:47.480]  and president donald trump had that was natural produced a lot of chemistry good television
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:52.760]  and they were actually respectful of each other it was chris wallis who injected negativity
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:58.280]  into it it was chris wallis who disrupted it in a way that did not produce or facilitate
[1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:02.240]  didn't chris wallis become the new meg and kelly i think i predict his career is over
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:05.640]  i predict his career is over and wait till you see what i'm going to drop yesterday
[1:34:05.640 --> 1:34:11.720]  we had two viral videos right before i went live we're at 990 000 views on a video my
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:18.600]  team produced uh yesterday so 990 000 views and it's it's it's less than 24 hours so
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:24.080]  it's 23 hours and 45 minutes we produced um this video that has nearly a million views
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:27.680]  and it shows that i missed the video so we're going to grab it play it next segment tell
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:31.400]  us the name and ollie alexander on twitter what's the name of the video we'll grab it
[1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:35.760]  yeah the name of the video is just hey in 2016 this is what donald trump told chris wallis
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:40.760]  and in 2020 this is what um it it told chris wallis and even my enemies are retweeting
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:45.320]  it that's how good the video is but but it shows in one minute and four seconds that
[1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:51.320]  donald trump got asked this same question in march of 2016 by chris wallis and he answered
[1:34:51.320 --> 1:34:56.520]  it so now we have we can prove that chris wallis did a bait and switch and he talked
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:01.640]  over donald trump to interrupt him because donald trump actually denounced white supremacy
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:06.600]  three times during that debate but i didn't hear it until i watched the replay but then
[1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:12.120]  we released a 1988 video with chris wallis on the gop convention floor with donald trump
[1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:17.280]  it's all that way and it shows that he had extreme animus towards donald trump then chris
[1:35:17.280 --> 1:35:24.200]  wallis is a truly swimy person he's a little rat and i got i got to tell you i got really
[1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:30.320]  angry last night i said hey if by noon you apologize to the american public for stoking
[1:35:30.320 --> 1:35:35.400]  racial animus then i won't release the other additional information that's going to hit
[1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:41.480]  way close to home so uh today i'm going to be releasing more information about how chris
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:47.920]  wallis is actually a beneficiary of systemic or so-called systemic racism so his career
[1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:53.680]  needs to be over and i plan to help expedite it well doesn't he know going up against trump
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:58.720]  and interrupting and lying that that made him very unpopular with his base fox news audience
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:04.640]  of course but look alex he's pivoting to the next job look fox news is not going to exist
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:09.360]  in three years they have plenty of competitors including yourself and other broadcasters
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:14.880]  oan there's not there's yeah oan in sinclair broadcasting newsmax there you know there's
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:18.360]  a lot of good people doing a lot of good work and you bring them on your show it's it's a
[1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:22.840]  team sport um but what people need to realize is there's not going to be a fox news in two
[1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:28.120]  or three years so the murdoch brothers are selling out their old pa they had they're married
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:32.680]  to liberal wives and that's who chris wallis was auditioning for and that's who john roberts
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:38.720]  is auditioning for today he repeated chris wallis's fake claims well i want to hear the
[1:36:38.720 --> 1:36:43.360]  new information from all of us hopefully you'll release it here ollie alexander is our guest

[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:14.040]  world and that's why the chai comms hollywood the globalist won us off the air because
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:19.160]  their global plan of total tyranny and a post human world will not succeed if we stay on

[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:56.160]  the renaissance the great enlightenment it's all being swept away and being replaced by
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:05.280]  scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:12.560]  are above the law the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow in fact humans are
[1:39:12.560 --> 1:39:18.480]  seen as garbage that's going to be taken out and removed that is the post human extremist
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:24.360]  plan that is the public ideology of the globalist and everything they've built with this high
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:32.880]  tech grid is to absorb us anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed and any future
[1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:37.720]  generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:45.400]  of what humans once were this is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:51.840]  God's creation humanity this is the essence of evil if you look at the top tech billionaires
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:56.800]  in the big banks that finance and control them to a man and to a woman they believe there's
[1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:00.840]  too many people on the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to a mountain
[1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:05.720]  top or a national park they have to look at us the common people they have to look at the
[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:09.920]  proletariat they have to look at the scum that's why they love the lockdown putting
[1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:14.520]  muscles on us that gives them a big thrill controlling where we can go what we can do
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:21.120]  bankrupting main street bankrupting small towns all of it is a vertical integration consolidation
[1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:25.560]  so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender which is taking sterilant
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:31.960]  vaccines day one ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over they used
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:36.200]  all the entertainment garbage to put us into a trance and now the spiders moving in for
[1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:41.040]  the kill you know this I know this it's all out in the open the question is what are we
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:45.280]  going to do about it well the first thing is identify the enemy identify the enemy identify
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:54.440]  the enemy identify your enemy now you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:41:08.120]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:12.240]  there on holly alexander talks about this video it's got about a million views now love
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:17.680]  the stuff he's turning out having a big effect all you can do it as well get vocal get active
[1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:20.840]  that's how we defeat the globalist there's a video of what trump said four years ago
[1:41:20.840 --> 1:41:28.400]  about racism versus what he said last this was tuesday night here it is i totally disavow
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:34.160]  the clutelux clan i totally disavow david duke i've been doing it now for two weeks
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:38.440]  this is your probably about the eighteenth person that's asked me the question it was
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:43.880]  very clear 2016 that question was also talked about in the form of groups groups i want
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:47.360]  to know which groups are you talking about you have to tell me which groups ultimately
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:52.000]  he got to the clutelux clan which obviously i'm going to disavow and by the way if you
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:57.760]  look at my twitter account almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:01.640]  you know it's amazing when i do something on twitter everybody picks it up goes all
[1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:06.200]  over the place but when i did this one nobody ever picks it up take a look at my twitter
[1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:13.320]  account thank you sir thank you are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:20.000]  groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:24.800]  of these cities as we saw in kanosha and as we've seen in portland are you willing to
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:34.040]  do that okay so let's talk about that it's the left shooting people and killing people
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:38.680]  yeah and then it's joe biden trying to say that it's trump causing it i mean this was
[1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:45.000]  just a disgusting display ollie it was it was you know in messaging we call this framing
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:49.920]  right so they put trump in this pen so the first question was like will you denounce
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:54.520]  white supremacists and he's like yeah sure and then he's like will you denounce this
[1:42:54.520 --> 1:43:02.160]  and this and he's like sure and then he cites two cities that the left has burned looted
[1:43:02.160 --> 1:43:08.160]  and murdered i mean absolutely insane and then down Trump's like okay where are we going
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:13.440]  with this question because it seems like you're dragging me by the hook in the mouth and you're
[1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:17.800]  not letting me answer the question so i could understand that donald trump was honestly
[1:43:17.800 --> 1:43:23.000]  confused i still wanted a stronger response but there can be no doubt and let's remember
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:30.160]  just last week in atlanta i was invited by the president i couldn't go on friday he unveiled
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:35.480]  of the platinum plan which was a uh a plan to put five hundred billion dollars into the
[1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:43.400]  black community and he designated the kkk and antifa terrorist groups so this didn't
[1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:49.480]  come out of nowhere what chris walis did in teaming up with joe biden was severely dirty
[1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:53.560]  it was underhanded it had nothing to do with journalism nothing to do with informing the
[1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:58.240]  american public and nothing to do with chilling violence out there which is all agree but even
[1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:03.840]  though it was a train wreck telemundo 66 percent agreement trump the cnn poll trump won i mean
[1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:07.880]  this this is backfiring sure it's annoying to watch but i mean i think people really
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:12.960]  saw how rigged this was maybe i mean i could i could totally be wrong i you know me i like
[1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:18.600]  being hard on our team and you know in public and private and so you know um i i got a handicap
[1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:23.760]  them a little bit but um look that telemundo poll was a twitter poll that they put up on
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:28.760]  their station so that that's that um but you know i did watch that cnn clip where only
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:34.000]  one person thought joe biden won and i had a lot of my friends who are moderates say
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:38.760]  i cut out after 20 minutes so maybe people didn't even see the clip but we know that
[1:44:38.760 --> 1:44:44.120]  the media is just going to do this occult repetitive spell where they say trump's erases
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:49.240]  trump's erases trump's erases biden survived biden survived biden survived and that's what
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:53.920]  they want to do they want to hypnotize the public i agree with you let's shift gears
[1:44:53.920 --> 1:44:58.040]  to one question walis asked it was important he said are your people going to cause a problem
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:02.280]  when the democrats contest the election and so everything's built around this the 20th
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:06.360]  amendment for people that don't know uh break down the latest on where you see all this
[1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:13.080]  is going i i i'm nervous you know i i think that god does need to intervene to introduce
[1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:18.040]  some clarity uh the day after the election i think that we have to blow out the democrats
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:23.680]  everybody has to vote everyone has to be an election judge or a poll watcher people need
[1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:29.480]  to sit in parking lots and and uh you know watch uh that's what i'll say i'll say they
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:34.280]  need to watch because i mean there are shenanigans already going on right now the pennsylvania
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:37.720]  election i don't know if you guys covered the news uh breaking out of there this morning
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:44.200]  but i mean it's it's a total uh uh crap show uh to put it lightly i mean the pennsylvania
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:48.240]  election is pretty much illegitimate they started sending out two and three absentee
[1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:52.720]  ballots to per person and they're all aired so now they're gonna put out a third batch
[1:45:52.720 --> 1:45:57.920]  of of ballots to people it's it's insane what's going on in our election because the democrats
[1:45:57.920 --> 1:46:03.760]  have put so much pressure on the democrat postal unions and these federal judges to rig the
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:07.280]  rules and change the rules so i'm really worried that we're not going to have an outcome but
[1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:11.440]  if we get an outcome even a day or two after election day it's going to be because god
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:16.200]  intervened and that's what i'm praying for because otherwise alex we're in a race against
[1:46:16.200 --> 1:46:22.160]  time for the electoral college that meets uh in early to mid december and i think you're
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:26.920]  going to have democrat governors who say no we're not sending our electors to the electoral
[1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:30.440]  college and then what does the house do and what does the senate do and then does nancy
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:36.480]  polosi declare herself madame president july 20 or june uh january 20th i mean we're
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:41.840]  really ruined some unconstitutional shaky territory going going forward which is a
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:47.840]  lot 32 days we're 32 days from the election but we're 110 until inauguration and the democrats
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:53.200]  are saying they're going to contest when they lose and they are and so this is on how does
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:58.880]  the president respond how do we respond because as you said in michigan in pennsylvania uh
[1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:05.280]  in several other states was constant the judges are ruling and the the federal courts are agreeing
[1:47:05.280 --> 1:47:09.600]  that this can go on for months to push us into 20th amendment territory where if a president
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:15.440]  isn't seated by january 20th 2021 the house representatives has a vote to create and and
[1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:20.720]  seek the next president sunlight is the best disinfectant you know michelle malkin love
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:26.640]  saying that and i agree i think that what we got to do is we've got to watch these precincts
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:31.920]  where it's allegedly 95 percent democrat or 98 percent democrat and see what they're actually
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:36.400]  doing we got to take out our cell phones we got to put our body in physical spaces and
[1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:41.120]  we need to catch their corruption because i'm convinced that even people who are duped in
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:47.440]  going with the left if they are presented with evidence clear concise evidence that the democrats
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:53.280]  are cheating on a systemic level they will reject them and that will chill their plans so what we
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:58.320]  got to do is we do have to catch them cheat cheating and this requires ordinary people who are used
[1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:04.720]  to being online activists or info wars listeners to actually get exactly and they're spinning that
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:10.560]  that that's illegal but oh meanwhile lebron james gives 10 000 people to become quote poll workers
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:16.000]  i think trump says they watch the polls everyone should go demand to be volunteers by law they have
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:21.760]  to let you be a poll watcher and a poll worker you just have to go through the sign up but sure of
[1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:25.840]  you right but what they're saying is federal violation is if you try to come and intimidate
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:30.560]  people so they're misrepresenting and telling conservatives or pro-trump populist or nationalist
[1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:36.000]  that we're not allowed to do this no no they have to by law let you in as a quote a helper
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:40.880]  an assistant somebody that does that but you just got to go through the process right and every state
[1:48:40.880 --> 1:48:48.640]  has different rules so everyone should duck duck go uh there um uh there uh go internet search with
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:53.520]  the rules are like for example in pennsylvania you have to be registered with the party and in that
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:59.680]  county um the a federal judge did not relieve rules where we wanted to put more poll watchers
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:05.040]  from outside the counties but still within the state so you have a problem even with the judges
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:09.840]  but everyone needs to become a poll watcher and if you're not a poll watcher then get in that parking
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:17.120]  lot and see if you see anything and alert people use everything use telegram use uh band.tv use
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:22.480]  twitter use facebook alert your fellow citizens let's all participate in this election because
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:27.040]  when there's enough eyeballs on a situation there's actually less violence and i know what
[1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:33.920]  you're talking about cbs news uh ran two different headlines one oh lebron james wants two 10 000
[1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:40.400]  poll watchers and then and then put out a headline saying um it's a federal crime if you're a republican
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:45.440]  and you want to watch the polls i mean it's an absolute joke we're watching the death rows
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:51.040]  of corporate media and and and god bless it because we'll actually get our republic back maybe
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:56.960]  here are the two cbs headlines that totally contradict each other on the same website
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:50:00.720]  after lebron james recruiting efforts more than 10 000 volunteers have signed up
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:07.440]  become poll workers meanwhile same cbs website trump encourages supporters independently monitor
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:13.520]  polling places a federal crime notice it says independently yeah so they play that game it's
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:20.080]  unbelievable it's unbelievable a federal crime they end the sentence they actually stole some of
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:24.720]  what donald trump does is what he does is he reverses his sentences so instead of saying
[1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:29.360]  it's a federal crime to blah blah blah he puts it at the end of the sentence and it's really brilliant
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:35.680]  so you can tell that the media is already trying to steal the tactics and invert these tactics
[1:50:35.680 --> 1:50:41.920]  against us the patriots ollie alexander thank you so much for joining us we have 50 seconds left
[1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:46.080]  what else would you like to impart to viewers i know you've got a big uh racism connection to

[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:40.560]  treasury he's joining us stay with us the way the psychological warfare operation works is very
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:46.480]  very simple they get you about freedoms by increments always promising it's only going to be a short
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:52.960]  period of time and then the restrictions will be released but they're not that for significant
[1:51:52.960 --> 1:51:57.840]  amount of time always four or five times longer than what they said they will then slightly release
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:03.440]  it a little bit only tighten it down even more later this is called successive approximation
[1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:10.160]  incrementalism or the inchworm effect this is the most common way that the talitarians take over
[1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:15.520]  but there then becomes a point where the public wakes up under the incrementalism he starts
[1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:20.000]  resisting and then there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down and you'll see more
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:24.400]  tyranny rolled out in just a few days weeks or months that you saw in the previous 10 years
[1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:31.280]  and that's the period we're in globally right now a world government chai combat globalist
[1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:36.720]  corporate takeover of the planet that once you pour an absolutely sick under their thumb forever

[1:53:57.280 --> 1:54:01.600]  so many of these we get busy we don't play and we're really getting conditioned to accept this
[1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:06.320]  all the racial attacks on white people democratic party going totally race spaces their history shows
[1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:13.520]  they are just unbelievable criminal activity but there's a clip i want to get to of uh portland
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:20.080]  protesters threatening people in a hotel because they're in a decent hotel and saying we're gonna
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:26.640]  get you so it's total class warfare funded by jeff bezos that funds black lives matter in antifa
[1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:30.720]  funded by the really rich guys that are exploiting everybody to make us all fight with each other
[1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:39.600]  while they laugh so let's go ahead and play that club it is incredibly disrespectful for all of you
[1:54:39.600 --> 1:54:45.760]  to be up here and you are so privileged there is a memorial for any man who is killed and you think
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:54.000]  it's more important to watch tv that is their priority stop get your priority straight this
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  isn't a trip this is our family this is our life i see them that's for the guy that got killed by the
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:07.680]  police have re-killed the prom boy my life is an inconvenience for some people and that is not okay
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:16.000]  it's an it makes me so angry it makes me so angry i mean just randomly and most of these are like
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.880]  rich white people that do this you listen to her she went to college she's a ruling class person
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:25.760]  she's supposed to run our life she works for the chai comms and now she's here lecturing us
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:29.280]  here's a little bit of trump and biden sparring over law and order in the debate we'll come back
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:35.600]  with dr ball greg roberts most don't like it but we have to have a system where people are held
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:41.600]  accountable went and by the way violence and response is never appropriate never appropriate
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:47.280]  peaceful protest is violence is never appropriate all right what is peaceful protest when they run
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:52.400]  through the middle of the town and burn down your stores and kill people over the place that is not
[1:55:52.400 --> 1:55:57.360]  peaceful president i'm not asking you say it is i would like to continue with the issue of race
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:03.440]  i promise we're going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment this month your administration
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:11.120]  directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:17.680]  critical race theory why did you decide to do that to end racial sensitivity training and
[1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:23.680]  do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country sir i ended it because it's racist
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:28.480]  i ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:36.560]  absolutely insane that it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military in our
[1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:42.000]  schools all over the place and you know it and so does everybody else radical and he would know
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:47.920]  what does radical look like racial sensitivity training if you were a certain person you had
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:52.800]  no status in life it was sort of a reversal and if you look at the people we would paint people
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:58.480]  hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:03.760]  and and really they were teaching people to hate our country and i'm not going to do that i'm not
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:10.080]  going to allow that to happen we have to go back to the core values of this country they were teaching
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:15.760]  people that our country is a horrible place it's a racist place and they were teaching people to
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:20.800]  hate our country and i'm not going to allow that to happen vice president biden nobody's doing that
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:25.760]  he's just he's racist you just don't here's the deal i i know a lot more about you don't let them
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:34.080]  finish the fact is that there is racial insensitivity people have to be made aware of what other people
[1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:40.640]  feel like what what insults them what is demeaning to them it's important to people know they don't
[1:57:40.640 --> 1:57:45.280]  want to many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings but it's a me it makes a big
[1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:49.760]  difference it makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:55.840]  self a sense of self-esteem it's a little bit like how this guy and and his friends look down
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:00.800]  on so many people they look down their nose on people like irish catholics like me and grow up
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:06.640]  at scranton they look at irish catholics all right that's enough it's globalist soros funded
[1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:12.640]  destroy society divide and conquer where they teach america death to america no borders no
[1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:17.760]  walls no us at all but whites are inherently bad and then once they start that programming
[1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:23.760]  it moves on from there and we saw the training manuals for the pentagon teaching that white
[1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:29.760]  people are bad and that george washington was bad this is a sick reeducation camp garbage
[1:58:30.400 --> 1:58:35.600]  dr paul craig roberts is an economist uh years fly by i love getting the sky's probably been a

[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:53.680]  in florida or are you in georgia right now i'm up in the blue ridge mountains here in george
[2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:59.600]  man i tell you we talked about new world order and global government and all this and look
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:04.880]  what about covet the the un says they're in charge and forced inoculations coming and
[2:01:04.880 --> 2:01:09.760]  tracker chips and the lockdowns never going to end cnn says i mean wow where do you want to start
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:15.920]  first as a uh as a fellow that's been around a while and seen a lot well alex it's your show
[2:01:16.640 --> 2:01:23.120]  and your audience um the covet thing we can start with that if you want i want to i want to pick
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:30.640]  your brand on all these subjects let's get into that first okay well the covet virus is real
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:40.400]  but from the very beginning it has been serving other agendas than public health
[2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:47.520]  it was obviously it would be used that way even if it wasn't very real
[2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:56.480]  and of course one of the agendas is to sell us a vaccine that enriches their big farmer even more
[2:01:57.200 --> 2:02:03.680]  they stand to make tens of billions of dollars from their from their vaccine so we have to have
[2:02:03.680 --> 2:02:11.280]  a covid crisis they have to keep it going long enough uh that some kind of vaccine can be concocted
[2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:23.120]  uh the uh the uh crisis of course also serves uh the growing police state because of all the
[2:02:23.840 --> 2:02:32.480]  sort of uh unconstitutional and probably illegal edicts that come from county governments state
[2:02:32.480 --> 2:02:41.920]  governments uh about how you have to close your business down how you have to wear a mask um how
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:50.560]  you have to uh lock yourself at home and so on and so on so it gets people accumulated uh sorry
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:56.160]  accustomed gets people accustomed to following orders that don't really serve their interests
[2:02:56.160 --> 2:03:03.200]  so we could go on about the agendas like the covid uh is being used to support but uh
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:08.080]  i wanted to ask you on that subject how do we reverse it how do we depoliticize it and not
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:13.840]  let them keep power grabbing with tracker traces and control apps and social credit scores and
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:17.440]  you know seeing and saying the lockdown never ends i mean i think we need to stop complying at a
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:27.040]  certain point here well i think uh actually uh information is coming out more and more experts
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:35.920]  more and more doctors are making the point that there's a cheap and surefire cure the hcq with
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:41.920]  zinc that it works it's uh it's safe it's a product that's been used for 65 years without
[2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:48.080]  killing anybody uh and then we don't eat a vaccine exactly could you believe big tech though has
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:52.640]  somewhat successfully suppressed even mainline medical doctors being able to say that for eight
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:03:58.560]  months undoubtedly killing a lot of people yeah i think that the public health authorities are
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:05.120]  guilty of mass murder by suppressing a known cure in order to make profits for a big farmer
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:12.400]  there's no doubt about that if you look at the relationships between public health authorities
[2:04:12.400 --> 2:04:20.480]  and uh and uh big farmer you can see all kinds of money relationships and all kinds of revolving
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:28.880]  doors and in fact the public health organizations got a lot of the funding from big farmer so it's
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:36.800]  not uh it's not a real regulatory situation it's a revolving door situation where the two reward
[2:04:36.800 --> 2:04:45.920]  each other for mutual service but nevertheless um you know the association of uh what is it
[2:04:45.920 --> 2:04:50.080]  surgeons and physicians or something like that it's an alternative to the american medical
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:58.480]  association they brought a lawsuit against the prohibitions uh against using hcq and the various
[2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:07.440]  governors have retracted their ban over its use and and more and more doctors are using it because
[2:05:07.440 --> 2:05:11.680]  they've got patients who otherwise are going to die exactly but that leads me to the final question
[2:05:11.680 --> 2:05:17.280]  on this subject we'll move into the other areas if big pharma and big tech don't get in trouble
[2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:22.080]  of what they've done they'll try it again and they already killed tens of thousands clearly
[2:05:22.080 --> 2:05:27.040]  millions hundreds of thousands worldwide and they knowingly did it i mean this is really a dangerous
[2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:34.960]  thing they did and it really was a litmus test to show just how evil they are that's true we you know
[2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:41.920]  the you can say the same thing about the military security complex and 20 years of wars and seven
[2:05:41.920 --> 2:05:49.120]  countries destroyed and hold apart yeah money uh brings out the evil in people and causes all kinds
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:55.760]  of hard things to happen there's no no doubt about it well you know i could make a bunch of money
[2:05:55.760 --> 2:06:00.560]  joining them i've had them offer me tons of money i've i've had you know top globalist offers a lot
[2:06:00.560 --> 2:06:04.720]  of money and to stop suing us it will roll over i'm not going to do it what's what's why are you
[2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:08.400]  that way why am i that way and why are they the way they are it seems like america's always had
[2:06:08.400 --> 2:06:13.120]  problems but there weren't so many people ready to sell out and be totally soulless because it's
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:18.640]  you got to be hardcore knowing a hydroxychoric one's basically 100 cure and it hold that back
[2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:23.120]  and have state governors block it from doctors i mean you mean you're cold cold blooded killer
[2:06:23.120 --> 2:06:32.720]  when you do that that's right um you know um over time um the sort of uh liberal relativism
[2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:40.080]  uh just it's destroyed standards for most people uh and so if there's no real good and evil and no
[2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:46.000]  right and wrong it's all the shade of this or that uh you can always go a little more shady in
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:52.720]  this direction if it's more if it's more money uh the kinds of people in the past the ones that i
[2:06:52.720 --> 2:06:58.960]  grew up with uh they they were brought up differently talked differently you know there was very clear
[2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:04.560]  was right wrongs black and white and uh you had to be able to look yourself in the mirror which
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:08.320]  did not mean what it means today you wouldn't want to make money off keeping the medicine
[2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:12.320]  from people and killing them you wouldn't want that you'll make money a good way why would you
[2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:16.000]  and it's like the knowledge of good and evil the bible talks about the knowledge of evil is the
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:20.800]  knowledge of how to run scams but you can make just as much money and be happier not doing it
[2:07:20.800 --> 2:07:28.640]  they just fundamentally don't get it well actually uh you can't make just as much money uh being
[2:07:28.640 --> 2:07:35.840]  honest you can make far more of being dishonest really uh yeah of course what do you think
[2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:43.920]  do you think uh the new york banks do i mean i agree with you because we set up an evil system
[2:07:43.920 --> 2:07:47.760]  once the system's more corrupt than good you absolutely you've got to be able to make money
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:51.520]  and you're absolutely right i'm saying if we were more moral we could all have a wealthier
[2:07:51.520 --> 2:07:59.600]  society based on good well i certainly agree with that and that's what i was saying um i grew up in
[2:07:59.600 --> 2:08:05.120]  a more moral society you had to look yourself in the mirror which meant uh you had to not
[2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:10.320]  done anything wrong but today you can't look yourself in the mirror unless you rip somebody off
[2:08:11.200 --> 2:08:17.520]  exactly so you don't feel good about yourself unless you rip somebody off that is really smart
[2:08:17.520 --> 2:08:23.840]  what you said a lot of people think it's cool to rip people off they think that's avant garde that
[2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:34.000]  it's a winner's trait well yeah it's something that's been uh inculcated uh not necessarily
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:40.960]  intentionally but just by uh the progress of uh everything being relative and there's no real
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:44.640]  right and wrong there's no real good and evil everything's a little bit good a little bit evil
[2:08:44.640 --> 2:08:52.880]  and so on so on as that passes through several generations people lose the concept that they
[2:08:52.880 --> 2:08:59.760]  have to behave properly because there's no rule no real definition of proper behavior or today the
[2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:05.840]  proper behavior is uh if you're a white person you have to hate yourself and all other white people
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:14.960]  because you're systemic racist or because uh you use gender pronouns uh and you uh uh you
[2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:22.880]  infuriate a handful of uh of abnormal people who think they're the opposite gender of what they are
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:28.720]  stay there dr paul craig roberts his his website's paul craig roberts dot or g we're gonna come back
[2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:34.720]  and get into this this this blurring on the lines this this moral relativism and then we'll get his
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:41.600]  view on geopolitics china israel europe uh the election so much more with dr paul craig roberts
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:46.640]  will tell you about some of his books as well i'm alex jones stay with us the planets have aligned
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:52.560]  globally they've aligned nationally they've aligned financially culturally but most importantly
[2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:59.600]  spiritually we are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:05.280]  destiny of our species so that's why big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist
[2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:11.520]  is trying to dumb us down isolate us make us depressed make us alone and traffic control
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:16.720]  every aspect of our lives literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward because
[2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:22.880]  they do not want us to take our birthright not just of americana but of true christendom and the
[2:10:22.880 --> 2:10:28.560]  renaissance and the enlightenment they are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the
[2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:34.400]  high technology and life extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:41.200]  carbon credits and through a social credit score this is their plan we must come together and awaken
[2:10:41.200 --> 2:10:47.680]  out of our trance and say no we must embrace god you notice that over and over again the united
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:52.400]  nations our supposed controllers and bosses the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:58.960]  disagree with has come out and said nothing can treat or prevent covid-19 well ladies and gentlemen
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:04.560]  that's a total lie if you get a lot of sunlight it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin d3
[2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:09.440]  and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin d3 if you
[2:11:09.440 --> 2:11:14.240]  have zinc and vitamin c as well that's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter because
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:20.720]  that's on vitamin d levels plunge now i've pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:24.720]  saying that there's hope and that people should have their vitamins and their minerals will now
[2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:29.840]  vouch he's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin d3 and see he should have also
[2:11:29.840 --> 2:11:35.200]  added zinc because the NIH website says you die without zinc but it's good news that he's being
[2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:40.320]  pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors and nurses and experts and nutrition
[2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:43.520]  have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins
[2:11:43.520 --> 2:11:49.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:09.440]  this latest book is meo conservative threat to world order we'll talk about that next segment
[2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:14.080]  dr paul craig roberts is our guest former had a policy at the treasury father or agonomics
[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:20.720]  i think he's a really honest uh good guy he's also a gentleman but i want him to address us here
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:24.800]  like even the last time he's on last time we're on air because i i mean i can tell you i've been on
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:29.280]  here 26 years under been dramatic like that um i don't get into stuff going on behind the scenes
[2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:34.480]  because that helps the enemy with their targeting but it's really bad okay and this country is on
[2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:39.280]  its last legs right now i don't say that to be negative or demoralize you i say that to get you
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:44.240]  understanding how serious it is all these different powerful forces are trying to bring the country
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:48.320]  down the republicans are corrupt the democrats are corrupt but they've gotten the left to go
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:54.880]  completely insane dr roberts what would you call this period of time we're in right now
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:59.120]  and from your research who are the factions uh because i know you've supported some of what
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:04.240]  trump does you haven't others i think trump means well i think he's manipulated some but clearly
[2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:09.040]  there's a larger establishment doesn't like him you agree you disagree how would you quantify
[2:13:09.040 --> 2:13:15.440]  that's what i can say as a real historian from real politic where we are and who the factions are
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:19.920]  well i'm not sure i know all the factions i know some of them
[2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:27.680]  one one is the global corporations particularly the global american corporations
[2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:35.920]  transnational as they recall and these corporations have done the united states economy a huge
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:42.640]  amount of harm more than anything in history because they shipped out of the country the
[2:13:43.520 --> 2:13:49.680]  high productivity high value added jobs that created the middle class so when they shipped
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:57.760]  all these jobs out of the country they shipped out american consumer income the agript demand
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:04.240]  that drove the economy they shipped out the tax base for cities and states and counties and they
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:14.320]  they they shipped out the wage base for uh social security medicare uh for the pension systems of
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:22.640]  the states and and our cities and have left uh ruins just awful ruins and some of the cities
[2:14:22.640 --> 2:14:30.960]  are actually in ruins from the loss of the jobs so what do these global corporations want now
[2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:40.560]  they want weak national states that they can run over so how you get a weak national state well you
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:47.760]  ship out all the good jobs the debts mount internally you support mass immigration because
[2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:53.920]  you can turn the country into a tower of babel and the tower of babel is not unified and can't
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:15:02.080]  stand up and so these are the kinds of ways that the global corporations destroy national
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:15.440]  sovereignty or any concept of a country so and then we have the cia since 1950 the cia has been
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:21.120]  working now you know there are two branches of the cia they're the analysts who are supposed to
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:26.880]  provide intelligence about what other countries are doing and so on and then there's the covert
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:34.160]  operations which uh uh president kruman said later in life he had made a serious mistake in
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:40.080]  permitting to be created uh john kennedy was going to break it into a thousand pieces but they got
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:47.360]  him first so but this is when we talk about cia we're talking about these covert black
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:55.600]  uh uh part of the agency well since 1950 they've been working to control the explanations they
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:16:03.040]  do that through the media they they suborn uh important journalists um and they use those
[2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:07.440]  journalists to control the explanations of stories if you notice every time something
[2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:14.800]  major happens the story is already prepared it's out instantly you remember 9 11 how quickly the
[2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:23.040]  story is out within seconds yeah so so uh and and today they actually have the entire
[2:16:23.040 --> 2:16:30.160]  to the media united states does not have a media in any real sense i mean a print or tv
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:37.120]  or uh media and in npr national public radio this is a this is a joke these are
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:45.600]  uh people who issue controlled explanations they all say the same thing it's a uniformity
[2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:54.080]  of voice and explanation so since they can control the explanations and they and their
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:17:03.120]  interests coincide with the with the globalist because the cia wants to rule and so um and also
[2:17:03.120 --> 2:17:09.840]  uh the military security complex has a huge budget and it depends on having enemies and so
[2:17:09.840 --> 2:17:15.520]  they're always fostering the impression among the public that they have dangerous enemies and
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:20.720]  we have to go to and then you've got hollywood that really hates america and is into a lot of
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:25.840]  sick stuff i want to how would you describe that combine right it didn't used to be that way a lot
[2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:33.280]  of people uh blame it on the jews taking over hollywood i myself don't know much about it but you
[2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:39.440]  hear these things and uh but certainly the whole nature of hollywood but if america saved the
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:45.840]  jews from hitler why would let this jews want to destroy america well i i don't know that we
[2:17:45.840 --> 2:17:52.960]  saved them i mean uh we we got in the russians the russians the russians won that war it was over
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:18:02.400]  with by the time we got there so um uh but um i don't know all of these that's not i read and
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:07.520]  i'm aware of the discussions about sure i'm just going into all all the different factions here
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:12.400]  and and i think you've gone over a lot of them how do the chai comms play into this
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:21.440]  they don't uh again that's a controlled explanation uh so another enemy in reserve
[2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:27.360]  uh they've got russians an enemy they're gonna ran and now they've got china um
[2:18:29.520 --> 2:18:35.360]  they're not china's not doing anything uh it was the american corporations who took the
[2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:40.240]  the factors to china and took the technology they had the business no oh no no i agree david
[2:18:40.240 --> 2:18:44.240]  rockefeller put malin to power and they said i agree the globalist that one's running china
[2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:49.840]  but then they got china taken over china as an engine of the globalist though is doing a lot
[2:18:49.840 --> 2:18:55.520]  of damage but i agree the globalists are the ones in charge no that's not what i said i don't think
[2:18:55.520 --> 2:19:00.960]  the globalists are in charge in china in fact i think they won't be able to take over china
[2:19:00.960 --> 2:19:05.280]  so you think the pivot happened 10 years ago when the globalists realized they didn't have control
[2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:14.480]  i think the world changed fundamentally when the soviet union collapsed because there was no longer
[2:19:14.480 --> 2:19:23.040]  a check on american hegemony as long as the soviet union was there the american couldn't the americans
[2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:29.120]  couldn't go running wild all over the world starting wars or or exploiting and looting
[2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:35.600]  countries and these kinds of things that have caused us so much trouble and it created so much
[2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:43.440]  animosity in the world against us um when soviet union collapsed that that uh took any constraint
[2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:51.360]  off of washington's behavior so do you see a bipolar world emerging again oh yeah sure i mean
[2:19:52.640 --> 2:20:01.680]  i think that in terms of power we are already displaced by russia and china and i don't think
[2:20:01.680 --> 2:20:09.920]  the united states will intensely start a war with either because we know we wouldn't do well
[2:20:09.920 --> 2:20:16.080]  but it's important to have an enemy if you've got a one thousand billion dollar annual military
[2:20:16.080 --> 2:20:22.800]  security complex budget it has to be justified and so when trump said he was going to reduce
[2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:27.920]  tensions with russia it created a huge scare in the military security complex that's where
[2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:34.080]  russia gate came from they've used it to stop him from reducing tensions with russia let's talk
[2:20:34.080 --> 2:20:38.080]  about those geo politics under paul greg roberts former head of policy of the u.s treasury left
[2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:42.400]  side on shows with info wars dot com and news wars dot com besides paul greg roberts dot com
[2:20:43.920 --> 2:20:50.240]  computer research scientists engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and put
[2:20:50.240 --> 2:20:56.560]  out detailed reports at tablet magazine documenting what any trained i could already see as plain as
[2:20:56.560 --> 2:21:02.640]  day communist chinese working in tandem with the united nations and the democratic party in the united
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:08.800]  states as well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like day of
[2:21:08.800 --> 2:21:14.560]  the dead into the world in china earlier this year then the u.n put out standardized rules
[2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:20.080]  designed to keep the west locked down when china reopened within three months this is the greatest
[2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:28.000]  strategic coup ever this is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:33.360]  or the ultimate style paul joseph watson has written about it at info wars dot com myself
[2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:38.080]  alex jones david i know insurer covering this heavily this is the way to bring down the globalist
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:45.760]  is exposing how communist china and the un were behind the hysteria and perhaps most cruely of all
[2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:52.400]  if donald trump has his way the complications from covid 19 which are well beyond
[2:21:52.400 --> 2:22:02.080]  what they should be it's estimated that 200 million people have died 200 million people have died
[2:22:02.080 --> 2:22:08.400]  probably by the time i finish this talk right after joe biden made that statement that more than 60
[2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:13.920]  percent of america has died from covid 19 when it's not even 200 000 reality he would want to say
[2:22:13.920 --> 2:22:18.960]  six million have lung scarring and heart damage it's all made up but you know where you got it the
[2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:24.480]  mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that they said that four percent of
[2:22:24.480 --> 2:22:30.720]  america would be dead already of course it's point zero zero zero zero and then add a number
[2:22:30.720 --> 2:22:36.560]  because the numbers vary it's a real virus just like people being struck by lightning is real
[2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:43.280]  but to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind-controlled introducing
[2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:52.080]  info war's life pure tumeric extract this is taken under the tongue it is pure tumeric it goes
[2:22:52.080 --> 2:22:58.080]  together very well with our body's ultimate tumeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule
[2:22:58.080 --> 2:23:04.000]  and absorbed in the stomach and intestines this is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:08.640]  and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an intense delivery
[2:23:08.640 --> 2:23:13.840]  system the two formulas are different but both are concentrates and our first product got rave
[2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:18.800]  reviews we've now been testing this out for several months some of our staff like it more than bodies
[2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:23.360]  some like bodies better for me they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action
[2:23:23.360 --> 2:23:28.800]  and so much more and they fund the info war so get our new liquid tumeric extract exclusively

[2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:29.840]  the paulgrig roberts.org you were getting into trump is the same guy he was 35 years ago i've
[2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:35.440]  seen the video clips we've played him here on larry king we've seen him on oprah saying hey i don't
[2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:38.720]  want to start a war we don't start war that's we should pull our troops back he was against the
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:43.440]  first gulf war we have the clip he was against the second gulf war not trying to lionize trump
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:47.520]  but he has tried to say why are we giving security for other countries to get all the
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:52.720]  rares minerals in in afghanistan why are we in in you know in iraq he seems to have a good
[2:24:52.720 --> 2:24:57.520]  instinct and you left off at the break for those that just joined us with the russia hysteria no
[2:24:57.520 --> 2:25:01.840]  real evidence he was connected to the russians we know but the mere fact that he didn't want to have
[2:25:01.840 --> 2:25:09.840]  war with russia was what put them into total hysteria mode yeah that's right trump probably
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:17.600]  didn't understand it but he threatened the budget and power of the cia and the pentagon
[2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:25.040]  that's the two main pillars of the military security complex and also of course all the
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:34.880]  private contractors i mean you know a huge number of defense companies so he was a direct threat to
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:41.200]  them and so they said we'll close them down if he had been the first they probably would have just
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:50.880]  assassinated him but it's hard to get away with the lone gunman a theory it used it too much
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:58.720]  so they assassinated him with russia gate within peach gate and now they're assassinating him with
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:05.600]  the notion they're fixing in the public's mind all over the world that he can only win the
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:11.760]  election by fraud and he will refuse to leave office and so a color revolution will be in
[2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:16.720]  place to dislodge it and that was my next question you have studied color revolutions
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:21.440]  you won a lot of international awards you know for your analysis of events you helped in the cold
[2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:26.880]  war bring down the soviet union you are credited with that and i know the russians are actually
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:30.640]  thankful for your help in that at the end of the day but they're they're saying we're going to
[2:26:30.640 --> 2:26:34.560]  contest the election but when you can test we're going to say you're a dictator and then we're
[2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:40.800]  going to hold it up with these ballots until the 20th and use the 20th amendment in january 20th
[2:26:40.800 --> 2:26:45.840]  to then have polosi elect the new president that that that's what they're officially saying they're
[2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:53.840]  going to do right now yeah sort of more or less or they don't really know how it's going to play out
[2:26:53.840 --> 2:27:02.960]  but the whole reason for the voting by mail is so a winner cannot be declared on election night
[2:27:04.400 --> 2:27:09.680]  so that gives them another couple of weeks or however long it takes for the votes to come in
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:16.800]  by mail for them to continue their propaganda the propaganda will be either that trump is lost
[2:27:16.800 --> 2:27:24.480]  and he refuses to step down or it will be uh he won by fraud and we we have to get him out so
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:27.920]  they don't know yet which way they're going to play i totally agree with you and they say
[2:27:27.920 --> 2:27:34.720]  they're going to do that so what do we do 32 days out to to to to try to blunt this or stop this
[2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:42.480]  well i don't know what we can do um it seems to me that uh the republican party
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:49.680]  or uh and trump should have done whatever they could to block uh voting by mail um the polls show
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:55.520]  that uh that the trump supporters are going to vote person and that the democrats are going to vote
[2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:03.280]  by mail so it's concocted i don't know why uh the republicans stood for it i mean i don't
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:09.200]  understand how the decision is made that you vote by mail again it's an important uh uh
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:14.480]  fact of coven so the claim is oh if you're going vote you'll get sick standing in line with all
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:22.960]  those people so you have to vote by mail well that's concocted and so um it's going to be a mess
[2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:28.240]  we don't know how it's going to play out i don't know exactly uh how they're going to work it i'm
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:31.920]  sure you saw the john pedestrian war game in the new york times they're talking about states
[2:28:31.920 --> 2:28:41.440]  succeeding another civil war their words well that would be a while at some point uh white people
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:49.920]  in america are going to catch on that they're being demonized as as bad if not worse than the
[2:28:49.920 --> 2:28:55.680]  jews were in nazi germany you're constantly demonized i mean that's what all this sensitivity
[2:28:55.680 --> 2:29:02.240]  training is about it's telling people you're racist you you have to give way to the people that
[2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:08.320]  have been persecuted and slaved and blah blah blah they're teaching this to five-year-olds
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:14.480]  in fact they've been doing it for decades only now a few people are beginning to notice
[2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:20.560]  but it's you know critical race theory has been taught in the universities and public schools for
[2:29:20.560 --> 2:29:26.960]  for many years that whites are inherently evil that that is literally like nazi dogma just reversed
[2:29:28.320 --> 2:29:35.280]  it explains why all the blm and antifa protesters as they're called are white
[2:29:37.520 --> 2:29:42.800]  they believe it they've fallen for it and so we now have self-hating white people
[2:29:42.800 --> 2:29:52.480]  you know the the Zionists call jews who criticize israeli policies self-hating jews
[2:29:53.120 --> 2:29:57.520]  well now we've got self-hating white people they are the products of the universities and the public
[2:29:57.520 --> 2:30:05.280]  schools it's this critical race theory has been taught i mean this all goes back to the 30s it's
[2:30:05.280 --> 2:30:12.320]  had a long time to do its erosion and have these effects it's not again the cia the ford foundation
[2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:17.040]  they've all funded liberation theology and radical race theory and trump is absolutely
[2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:21.680]  right to block this i read what the pentagon was teaching it literally says whites are inherently
[2:30:21.680 --> 2:30:26.480]  evil america's bad i mean this is ridiculous and the and the secretary of defense said we're
[2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:33.440]  going to keep doing it no matter what trump wants he should fire his ass that's right uh
[2:30:33.440 --> 2:30:39.120]  but look alex they've been doing this for years it's been going on in the schools for years and
[2:30:39.120 --> 2:30:45.520]  years it's now reached pentagon but it's nothing new about this teaching and that's how it reaches
[2:30:45.520 --> 2:30:52.880]  the pentagon it just becomes common and ordinary um and so i remember back in the 80s my dad owned
[2:30:52.880 --> 2:30:56.560]  part of a hospital the group of doctors and he was fighting then he wasn't even a big radical
[2:30:56.560 --> 2:31:00.960]  political guy they were trying to do race race teaching sensitivity training he remember him
[2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:06.000]  at the dinner table had the training going look at this this is marxist hate america crap so like
[2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:13.760]  you said this has been going on since the 30s really yeah yeah and and ever widening expanding
[2:31:13.760 --> 2:31:19.520]  expanding expanding until it's just now the commonplace it affects a large percentage of
[2:31:20.320 --> 2:31:26.960]  white americans well yes they're not christian anymore we're so now we just have the sin of
[2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:37.040]  being white it's a religion uh if you're if you're born white you're born racist now of course all
[2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:43.280]  of this is also institutionalized the universities and black studies and women's studies all of this
[2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:48.640]  what can we do what can trump do i think just take it head on and like trump said the debate
[2:31:48.640 --> 2:31:58.240]  here this is racist this is crap i don't know what he can do um one can just hope enough people realize
[2:31:58.240 --> 2:32:03.760]  that uh their lives at state one way or the other that look the whites are still the majority of
[2:32:03.760 --> 2:32:10.240]  the population even though we've lost 20 or 30 percent of whites uh to critical race theory
[2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:16.880]  but um they they have to understand they're being demonized that they're being set up in the same
[2:32:16.880 --> 2:32:23.200]  way the jews were in nazi germany and they have to not to denounce themselves and they have to step
[2:32:23.200 --> 2:32:30.800]  aside and you see uh one of the big uh accusations that get them against the nazis were that they
[2:32:30.800 --> 2:32:36.160]  had quotas for the jews they could only have so many jews in a university only so many here
[2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:42.880]  only so many there well that's what uh affirmative action does it put your quotas on whites
[2:32:42.880 --> 2:32:48.160]  that's right the left has literally co-opted the hitler ideology for reversing its whites
[2:32:49.040 --> 2:32:55.120]  that's it that's a good way to to understand it we the white people are now being set up
[2:32:55.120 --> 2:33:01.040]  and treated just like the jews were in nazi germany in fact it's worse here because i don't
[2:33:01.040 --> 2:33:09.040]  know if they were uh making jews go to uh seminars and be uh taught that they were anti-german
[2:33:09.040 --> 2:33:15.840]  or something like that but it's a situation a situation that's so ingrained what do you do
[2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:20.240]  about it well dr paul roberts you've really knocked it out of the park today your new book
[2:33:20.240 --> 2:33:25.120]  on the neocons is uh critical paulpert roberts.org please join us again very very soon come back
[2:33:25.120 --> 2:33:29.360]  on in a week a month during the election come on the other shows we really appreciate you sir
[2:33:30.160 --> 2:33:36.160]  well invite me thank you sir all right we got big news on the brothmans and their sex rings
[2:33:36.160 --> 2:33:39.760]  straight ahead a big conviction we'll cover it on the other side stay with us
[2:33:41.680 --> 2:33:47.120]  the way the psychological warfare operation works is very very simple they give you about freedoms
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:52.640]  by increments always promising it's only gonna be a short period of time and then the restrictions
[2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:58.480]  will be released but they're not they have a significant amount of time always four or five
[2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:03.520]  times longer than what they said they will then slightly release it a little bit only tighten it
[2:34:03.520 --> 2:34:10.160]  down even more later this is called successive approximation incrementalism or the inchworm
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:15.680]  effect this is the most common way that the talitarians take over but there then becomes a point
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:20.720]  where the public wakes up under the incrementalism he starts resisting and then there's usually a
[2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:26.560]  giant purge and a clamp down and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a few days weeks or
[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:32.160]  months than you saw in the previous 10 years and that's the period we're in globally right now a
[2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:38.400]  world government chai combat globalist corporate takeover of the planet that wants you for an
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:44.400]  absolutely sick under their thumb forever the globalists are very very honest about their
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:52.880]  planetary goals they want private corporate governance above nation states above religious
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:59.520]  institutions above the family they want total corporate power there was a great film back in
[2:34:59.520 --> 2:35:06.880]  the early 1970s called rollerball with james kahn that's based on a novel set in the year 2020
[2:35:07.520 --> 2:35:12.720]  and in the book you have mega corporations that control the planet and there are no longer
[2:35:12.720 --> 2:35:20.160]  nation states there are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations if you actually read
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:26.560]  what the most group of the cfr trilateral commission say in the year 2020 that is their in game that is
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:33.040]  their goal so we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very very very ruthless
[2:35:33.040 --> 2:35:38.880]  people see us as shadow they're using coven 19 as their takeover strategy the communist china as
[2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:46.720]  their model we must reject it now are you sick and tired of your calm peaceful life are you sleeping
[2:35:46.720 --> 2:35:57.440]  too well at night is your city too safe well not anymore introducing democrats politicians so incompetent
[2:35:57.440 --> 2:36:05.440]  they'll fill your neighborhood with riots looting rampant violence and even homelessness the secret
[2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:12.400]  is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity no more pesky law and order when
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:19.520]  democrats are in charge nobody's safe simply vote for democrats sit back and watch your neighborhood
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:26.320]  burn to the ground plug weight vote for democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts election
[2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:42.720]  fraud cancel culture taxes and more taxes democrats bringing chaos right to your front door the
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:48.880]  planets have aligned globally they've aligned nationally they've aligned financially culturally
[2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:55.840]  but most importantly spiritually we are living at a point in human development that's beside
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:01.760]  the entire future destiny of our species so that's why big tech control with the very dark forces
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:08.880]  the globalist is trying to dumb us down isolate us make us depressed make us alone and try to
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:13.600]  control every aspect of our lives literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:19.680]  forward because they do not want us to take our birthright not just of americana but of true christ
[2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:25.760]  of them and the renaissance and the enlightenment they are trying to create the new dark age where
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:31.360]  they have all the high technology and life extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:37.840]  controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score this is their plan we must
[2:37:37.840 --> 2:37:47.120]  come together and awaken out of our trance and say no we must embrace god you're listening to the
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:52.080]  alex jones show
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:37:58.240]  the only two things in life that make it worth living
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:07.600]  his guitars are too good and firm feeling women i don't need my name in the marquis lights
[2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:18.640]  i got my song and i've got you with me tonight maybe it's time we got back to the basics of
[2:38:18.640 --> 2:38:23.520]  love let's go to lukin about texas
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:29.840]  i should smoke a big old fat joint with willy nelson and lukin buck
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:33.920]  i'm not a pot smoker but when joe rogan pulls it out
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:37.680]  like the hat or you know willie you might as well go ahead and do it that's about it
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:43.440]  between anguilla's pain it's not named profit it's just your story
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:49.840]  blue eyes crying in the rain out in lukin buck texas
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:58.080]  ain't nobody feeling no pain i'll tell you who's feeling the pain is the pedophile rings
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:03.360]  as it begins to collapse and joining us more and more on the show i've been interviewing him for a
[2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:08.240]  long time we're really really honored to have him here is patrick howley of national file.com
[2:39:08.240 --> 2:39:15.920]  he also writes for great folks over at epic times and other places and after he leaves us in about
[2:39:15.920 --> 2:39:19.280]  15 minutes or so i've got a little other key news i want to cover some good news on the
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:24.320]  covid front worldwide resistance intensifying but wow let's get into it first the nexium
[2:39:24.320 --> 2:39:29.520]  overlord claire brothman we know tied to epsiode everybody else
[2:39:31.040 --> 2:39:33.600]  illegal clinton bundler sentenced to prison
[2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:39.120]  trafficking kids in and out of mexico john and god oprah whimpery connections
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:44.160]  those of us that just want to go home and cook a hamburger grill a steak and watch a tv show or
[2:39:44.160 --> 2:39:50.800]  swim in the pool with our kids or go for a hike we never get tired of hank liam's junior we never
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:55.040]  get tired of you know listening to george straight whatever you get tired listening well in genics
[2:39:55.040 --> 2:39:59.200]  whenever you get tired drinking a cold beer we just imagine running cults where women are starving
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:05.120]  to death and you got little kids in cages and but see it's about satanic power and those of us that
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:10.320]  aren't into that we just it's like it doesn't exist but it does and it's all starting to come out so
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:14.960]  mr howley thanks for joining us let's get to the latest as the satanic house of cards comes down
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:20.880]  well alex this is a great time to be alive because you're sensing the spiritual energy
[2:40:20.880 --> 2:40:27.040]  shifting for so long everyone no matter what your political persuasion is senses that there's
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:32.960]  something wrong with modernity the wrong people are in charge the wrong kind of energy is prevailing
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:38.400]  and finally we're beginning to shift away from that and claire brothman being put in prison for
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:44.480]  81 months now they got her on charges of enabling credit card fraud and herbering an illegal immigrant
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:51.360]  so obviously this ties in to the border issue and we'll get into that but this is a massive case of a
[2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:57.920]  very closely politically connected democrat donor a an illegal bundler actually for hillary clinton's
[2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:04.800]  2008 presidential campaign who had the nexium cult members give donations to hillary clinton and then
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:10.400]  she reimbursed them against the law this person is now going to prison this person is going to
[2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:16.640]  face justice and so the spiritual energy of that i think is something that's resounding around the
[2:41:16.640 --> 2:41:22.800]  world especially as keith ranire the leader of the nexium cult faces sentencing on october 27th
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:27.600]  it gives him the next couple of weeks during this election to talk more to talk more about gillian
[2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:32.880]  maxwell to talk more about richard branson to talk more about all of the people who are connected
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:39.520]  to this very elite sick sinister satanist club and make no mistake the nexium cult that was operating
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:44.720]  in upstate new york was satanic it was satanist it was closely connected to hillary clinton
[2:41:44.720 --> 2:41:49.760]  kirsten jillibrand and other democrat politicians and it was pushing luciferianism upon the world
[2:41:50.320 --> 2:41:54.400]  and it's just a feeder group i remember like three and a half years ago i did a video about
[2:41:55.040 --> 2:41:59.200]  harvey weinstein and how they brand women and then they got really upset and they had a big
[2:41:59.200 --> 2:42:02.320]  hubbing and post-harvesting nobody's getting branded because they you know i had sources
[2:42:02.320 --> 2:42:07.200]  telling them what was going on but is it nexium only one feeder that then it just gets darker and
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:13.120]  darker the deeper you go down absolutely right and in fact ellison mac taped keithrenary at trial
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:18.800]  and keithrenary was saying that he wanted the branding set ceremonies to emulate human sacrifice
[2:42:18.800 --> 2:42:24.640]  they were absolutely obsessed with satan and by the way i want to give a lot of credit to roger stone
[2:42:24.640 --> 2:42:30.320]  for helping me to do all of this reporting over the last couple of years in part by setting me up
[2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:35.120]  with the nexium whistleblower frank parlato who has put me in touch with many many other and that's
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:39.200]  why the media has spun it that he was involved because he was instrumental in exposing it that's
[2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:45.680]  how they always do it absolutely right i saw that happen in real time he wasn't involved he found out
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:51.360]  about it as everybody in politics did and he determined to try to help me expose it and he
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:42:55.840]  trusted me as an investigative reporter and i'm eternally grateful to him for that but you know
[2:42:55.840 --> 2:43:00.080]  i've talked to so many people including i should have said you're the main journalist exposing
[2:43:00.080 --> 2:43:05.040]  nexium as you know we just announced your your your biggest laurel up front because you've done a great
[2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:10.880]  job well sure and and you have to understand this this all ties together it ties into epstein i've
[2:43:10.880 --> 2:43:16.560]  been on the trail of epstein i was the one who got uh steve bannon into exposing epstein at well we
[2:43:16.560 --> 2:43:22.000]  know that brother still runs an airfield that advertises girls a little after 12 years old
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:27.440]  as stewardess is up by that same cult we know avino baranovic is in the area my god you can't
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:32.640]  swing a stick in that area of new york and not hit a devil or sport hillary clinton in the woods
[2:43:32.640 --> 2:43:36.880]  hillary clinton out in the woods our friend in the woods so you know i i want to say this because
[2:43:36.880 --> 2:43:41.760]  it's so important i spoke to a woman named heidi hutchinson she's the sister of a of a girl who
[2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:49.040]  was raped by keith renier as a teenager and this girl her sister was found dead of a gunshot wound
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:56.800]  to the head at a buddhist monastery in woodstock new york and she blames keith renier for the death
[2:43:56.800 --> 2:44:01.360]  whether it was a suicide or a murder heidi hutchinson told me in no uncertain terms i think he
[2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:06.800]  thought of himself as satan quote he used the whole luciferian concept basically i think he
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:12.880]  came to think of himself as lucifer when you look at the videos of keith renier speaking to women
[2:44:12.880 --> 2:44:17.760]  and talking about the data the data what what does that actually mean you look into what claire
[2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:22.000]  bronfen was actually doing with something called the rainbow cultural garden and that was human
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:26.080]  experimentation centers where they were experimenting on little kids teaching them seven different
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:30.320]  languages with seven different nannies they would they had a doctor this is this is t this is t
[2:44:30.320 --> 2:44:35.760]  that's just the cover and then the zoro ranch and then the cloning and i mean this is really
[2:44:35.760 --> 2:44:41.040]  a feeder group into like i think secret experimentation absolutely and it's it's very
[2:44:41.040 --> 2:44:44.880]  similar to a clockwork orange they predict to program this in a clockwork orange holding
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:49.840]  people's eyes open making them watch horrible films and i would talk i talked to the neighbors
[2:44:49.840 --> 2:44:53.760]  of this cult they said they would hear screaming in the woods because they would show them these
[2:44:53.760 --> 2:44:59.680]  films and they were studying people's brainwaves studying people's brain energy and then using
[2:44:59.680 --> 2:45:07.520]  that data to try to figure out how to torture more mind control testing more mk ultra yeah but
[2:45:07.520 --> 2:45:13.120]  think too about how this was being used and how this is being employed in a foreign policy context
[2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:18.560]  sarah bronfman who is claire bronfman's sister was integral in taking down gadafi now i've reported
[2:45:18.560 --> 2:45:24.560]  that geelyne maxwell's nephew worked for the hillary clinton state department overseeing libya
[2:45:24.560 --> 2:45:29.360]  just today i reported that a different geelyne maxwell nephew was working in the obama biden
[2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:34.720]  whitehouse sarah bronfman was integral working with hillary clinton and the and the whole nexus of
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:40.480]  them there to bring down gadafi and to try to install her husband actually as the main oligarch in
[2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:47.520]  libya and then set up a canada um libya trade uh project and then meanwhile obama was working
[2:45:47.520 --> 2:45:54.880]  with his cousin odinga uh into kenya with the muslim brotherhood to overthrow that state and set
[2:45:54.880 --> 2:46:00.720]  them up as a king as well so they really dream of being kings yep i have it right here sarah
[2:46:00.720 --> 2:46:06.480]  bronfman took a trip to libya in 2011 to do a rebel reintegration program so if you think about
[2:46:06.480 --> 2:46:11.680]  the refugee crisis the destabilization project in the middle east flooding the the refugees into
[2:46:11.680 --> 2:46:17.440]  europe flooding them into america creating a globalist government under the brand of
[2:46:17.440 --> 2:46:22.640]  luciferianism literally the brand that creates the u n excuse the u n controls it and they get
[2:46:22.640 --> 2:46:27.680]  lots of extra kids it crushes the nation state they now can control these migrant groups that they
[2:46:27.680 --> 2:46:32.240]  then put on welfare and farm the money off of this is and then they can also disappear whoever they
[2:46:32.240 --> 2:46:38.000]  want it's all in plain sight now and it's it's the work uh and i have to credit the eastern
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:43.680]  district of new york for helping to bring nexium to justice um at brooklyn federal court and it's
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:48.080]  all out there it's all out there and so i have to come on the alex joneshow because it's the only
[2:46:48.080 --> 2:46:53.200]  place in media that will take all of these disparate threads and and and and make it very very clear

[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:37.600]  I don't want to be negative about the prospects of the election but I need to be honest with
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:43.280]  everybody the democrats and their deep state controllers common Chinese have come out and
[2:48:43.280 --> 2:48:47.040]  said they're going to contest the election they know that Trump's going to win a landslide and
[2:48:47.040 --> 2:48:52.720]  the destabilization that that's going to cause is going to further destroy the markets and the economy
[2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:56.960]  and going into the future even if Trump is able to prove that he's won the election
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:49:03.040]  the democrats have said they're going to break away politically and culturally into the blue
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:09.680]  states and blue cities and basically use that as a pretext of sabotage the republic even more so
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:15.760]  until this cancer is rooted out until these criminals that work with foreign governments
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:20.640]  they're trying to basically destroy the country are punished and removed it's just going to continue
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:26.960]  to happen and so that's the big problem here that is that we have systemic dug-in corruption by
[2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:36.320]  people that hate the country's very existence remember the global lock-downs you're witnessing
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:42.800]  the black lives matter anti-for-riots and racial attacks we're all seeing are publicly directed
[2:49:42.800 --> 2:49:50.240]  by a handful of top billionaires led by people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, of course Tim Cook,
[2:49:50.240 --> 2:49:56.800]  and others they set up there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies and
[2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:02.560]  they're hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that against us and trying to create
[2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:08.560]  an artificial revolution against local government and police and the mayors are again they're playing
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:13.920]  their political game to try to trigger the complete breakdown of the united states in western europe
[2:50:13.920 --> 2:50:18.640]  show these billionaires can come in and buy it all up for billions on the dollar that's why i'm so
[2:50:18.640 --> 2:50:22.400]  angry that these globalists because when you're looking at them they're the ones that sit in
[2:50:22.400 --> 2:50:28.640]  their councils and have decided to run these plans against us they are enemies of humanity and must
[2:50:28.640 --> 2:50:44.560]  be dealt with it's us or them period you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:52.800 --> 2:50:56.720]  we are back broadcasting we're a lot of a bunch of big breaking news next segment
[2:50:56.720 --> 2:51:03.280]  and we have of course Patrick Halley of NationalFall.com right and shotgun with us right now
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:08.160]  patrick you were getting into tying all the different strings together and what this means
[2:51:08.160 --> 2:51:13.120]  the election who the players are who's behind these networks and what you expect to be unfolding next
[2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:18.640]  absolutely right now if you think about what's going on here geely and maxwell's father robert
[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:24.880]  maxwell is a long time known massage asset according to intelligence insiders he has closely
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:28.560]  partnered in the past he's dead now of course he closely partnered in the past with the bronfman
[2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:34.560]  family the bronfman family who are behind nexium now hillary clinton and the clinton's very very
[2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:39.680]  closely tied to nexium i talked to a former employee who said richard maize formally of the
[2:51:40.800 --> 2:51:45.760]  he was a clinton's fixer in the white house here is from arkansas he was the conduit between
[2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:52.640]  nexium and the clinton's you had kirsten jillibrand's father who is a lobbyist employed by the cult
[2:51:52.640 --> 2:51:57.680]  that's where he met kirsten jillibrand stepmother who is a member of the cult even fox news had
[2:51:57.680 --> 2:52:02.320]  accredited me with that story and an eyewitness told me that gillibrand was at a hillary event in
[2:52:02.320 --> 2:52:08.000]  2006 the three front tables vip were all bought by nexium gillibrand was sitting there with one of
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:14.400]  the leaders of the cult nancy saltsman so if you look at what then sarah bronfman was doing in libya
[2:52:14.960 --> 2:52:22.160]  personally interceding in order to take out gadafi create a rebel uprising create a refugee crisis
[2:52:22.160 --> 2:52:26.800]  if you look at the fact that hillary clinton's state department and even the obama biden white
[2:52:26.800 --> 2:52:32.800]  house was being influenced by its employees two of whom were gillian maxwell's nephews if you look
[2:52:32.800 --> 2:52:38.640]  at what the agenda is here and you and you understand that it's luciferianism that you understand
[2:52:38.640 --> 2:52:44.960]  that the satanic ceremonies that were going on at nexium or at epstein island that is what the
[2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:49.600]  theme that's what the tenor of the new world order really is so all these things now are tying
[2:52:49.600 --> 2:52:55.280]  together and it's an amazing thing to see it is let me just add this i mean these really are maniacs
[2:52:55.280 --> 2:52:59.280]  i believe they have a right to rule the world who want to overthrow nation states and set up hell
[2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:05.040]  on earth i mean they are they are safe they are satan it's like uh rules for radical solinski
[2:53:05.040 --> 2:53:09.280]  he said i pledge this to lucifer i want to be like lucifer they want to overthrow everything and
[2:53:09.280 --> 2:53:15.200]  rule everybody it's so obvious that they admit this that's absolutely right and so that's why all
[2:53:15.200 --> 2:53:20.080]  of these things that you're seeing which is kind of creating this uh confusing collage why why so
[2:53:20.080 --> 2:53:25.360]  many experiments with children why is this so uh tied into children well we know alistair crowley
[2:53:25.360 --> 2:53:30.480]  his magic rituals you know he told the world that it's more powerful if you torture children or if
[2:53:30.480 --> 2:53:34.160]  you even kill children or if you just have sex with his son he finally killed him in a ritual
[2:53:34.880 --> 2:53:37.600]  that's why they were so proud of him for what he did he's a horrible pedophile
[2:53:38.640 --> 2:53:42.880]  they believe that that gives them power they believe that the wizardry of media
[2:53:42.880 --> 2:53:47.840]  gives power to their spells if they tell people exactly what they're doing uh geelyne maxwell's
[2:53:47.840 --> 2:53:51.360]  nephew worked at hillary clinton state department this was another one of my scoops we have been
[2:53:51.360 --> 2:53:54.960]  driving this and so what we need to do now is we need to put this all together and we make it need
[2:53:54.960 --> 2:54:00.160]  to make a very clear case listen you want to elect joe biden you want to elect uh kamala harris who
[2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:04.560]  has turned a blind eye to the child protective services crisis in california and even contributed
[2:54:04.560 --> 2:54:10.240]  to it with the corruption if you want to i mean joe biden i have another story coming out about
[2:54:10.240 --> 2:54:16.000]  you know his daughter-in-law's group that uh he was raising money for and a scandal where a guy had
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:21.280]  to uh you know be thrown out because one of the employees was allegedly hitting on a teenage boy
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:27.520]  in a bathroom allegedly trying to lure him into prostitution if you want these sick people in power
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:32.160]  where you're going to get is you're going to get all of the hatred all of the chaos all of the
[2:54:32.160 --> 2:54:37.040]  division and destabilization and instability of the past 20 30 years of modernity and you're
[2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:42.400]  going to get it all at once in your face in the year 2021 unless you allow president donald trump
[2:54:42.400 --> 2:54:48.320]  who has been on epstein's case i know for years and was even a federal informant the first time
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:53.040]  that epstein went down if you want president donald trump to be able to stop this you see
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:57.760]  what's happening right now in the month of october you see what's going on you see that this is um
[2:54:57.760 --> 2:55:02.400]  yeah this is go time right now it's all coming together and that's why we need to get president
[2:55:02.400 --> 2:55:06.800]  donald trump another term we need to stop these satanic people from getting into power yet again
[2:55:09.040 --> 2:55:13.120]  mr howley you're on fire and i just made me think of when we'll come back and show these articles
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:18.160]  they just signed a bill in california that you can have sexual kids down to age 12
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:24.560]  they just signed a bill and governor noose of sending convicted rapist men into prisons if they
[2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:31.040]  say they're women and they're raping women and now they're busting quote trannies raping kids
[2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:36.640]  in bathroom stalls in the mid the liberals go it's okay i mean these are just a pedophile army of
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:46.400]  satanists the renaissance the great enlightenment it's all being swept away and being replaced by
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:56.720]  scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats are
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:04.160]  above the law the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow in fact humans are seen
[2:56:04.160 --> 2:56:11.600]  as garbage it's going to be taken out and removed that is the post-human extremist plan that is the
[2:56:11.600 --> 2:56:17.440]  public ideology of the globalists and everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:25.200]  absorb us and anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed and any future generations that
[2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:30.880]  happen to straggle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what humans once were
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:38.960]  this is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism against god's creation humanity this
[2:56:38.960 --> 2:56:54.880]  is the essence of evil
[2:56:54.880 --> 2:56:56.880]  you
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:12.720]  prosecutors in the austin area have thrown out a drunk driving charge against conspiracy
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:17.440]  theorists radio talk show host alice jones you know back in march he was pulled over by travis
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:22.640]  county debits for going five miles ahead of the speed limit there jones did fail field sobriety
[2:57:22.640 --> 2:57:27.280]  test at night but according to court documentation the charge now has been rejected
[2:57:27.280 --> 2:57:39.760]  this but
[2:57:41.120 --> 2:57:43.760]  yeah here's our new single record
[2:57:43.760 --> 2:57:45.760]  you
[2:57:45.760 --> 2:57:55.760]  you
[2:58:07.200 --> 2:58:14.160]  oh we are back live despite some computer misfiring that happens you notice that little clip on the
[2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:20.080]  local news about the drunk driving charge dropped on me that's because i was not over the level as i
[2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:26.560]  told the police that i had two glasses of wine and of course they still took me to jail but i've
[2:58:26.560 --> 2:58:30.160]  gotten so neurotic that back in high school and college i had a lot of the police go no i've been
[2:58:30.160 --> 2:58:33.680]  drinking obviously they let me go if you had anything to drink yeah i had two glasses of wine
[2:58:33.680 --> 2:58:39.920]  boom arrested and i just couldn't lie it's it's it's it's almost becoming weakness uh but you
[2:58:39.920 --> 2:58:46.480]  know it's it's it's just good that i don't lie and the more i don't lie even my wife about it was
[2:58:46.480 --> 2:58:51.840]  dinner good or or she looked you know whatever the the more keen my brain gets where it's never
[2:58:51.840 --> 2:58:56.160]  trying to figure out what it's about to say it's never about to hold back what it's going to say
[2:58:56.160 --> 2:58:59.680]  it just says what it really thinks and that's why they want political correctness that's why
[2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:04.880]  they want us to not use certain words is they want us to lie that's a form of lying when you
[2:59:04.880 --> 2:59:09.680]  don't say what you really think about things and so i pledge the listeners and the viewers to really
[2:59:09.680 --> 2:59:15.920]  tell you the truth even if sometimes it hurts me you notice at the end god turned it around for good
[2:59:15.920 --> 2:59:20.720]  i'm going back to patrick howley of national file dot com and the big breaking news the pedophile
[2:59:20.720 --> 2:59:26.000]  rings and 2020 and where this is going what else do you want to add about what's unfolding new
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:31.120]  developments that are coming out soon i know you're you're working on well i always try to bring it
[2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:35.120]  on this show alex because you know anytime i break a story all these great people very well
[2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:40.320]  meeting people like oh they might arc inside you you know watch out for hillary oh please give me
[2:59:40.320 --> 2:59:44.240]  a break my uh segments on the show would go more viral than ever if that happened and wake up the
[2:59:44.240 --> 2:59:49.120]  whole world and what we need to wake up the whole world to is exactly what was happening with nexium
[2:59:49.120 --> 2:59:53.920]  and epstein which is the following because it ties into everything claire brothman was writing fake
[2:59:53.920 --> 2:59:59.120]  visas gaming the immigration system bringing illegal immigrant child sex slaves from her rainbow
[2:59:59.120 --> 3:00:05.280]  cultural garden centers which she set up in guatemala and mexico grooming kids she was bringing kids
[3:00:05.280 --> 3:00:10.240]  over at the border to serve as slaves here in the united states modern day slavery locking them in
[3:00:10.240 --> 3:00:15.280]  rooms torturing them torturing them in satanic rituals trying to study their brain energy
[3:00:15.920 --> 3:00:20.080]  for by the way let me just say this right here i had family that worked in secret operations for the
[3:00:20.080 --> 3:00:26.080]  army that's a type of army where you're not wearing a uniform okay that type of army and
[3:00:26.080 --> 3:00:31.360]  then they would never tell me about what they did they were highly decorated vietnam i mean
[3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:36.960]  you know like six silver stars nobody gets that and they were in iran contra and they were in
[3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:41.680]  it all they thought they were fighting communist but when they got out of it and had the system
[3:00:41.680 --> 3:00:47.360]  come after them was children and this family member who's dead now one time out at the ranch
[3:00:47.360 --> 3:00:52.160]  he said to me about a year before he died he looked at me and he was always this nice guy this
[3:00:52.160 --> 3:00:56.160]  wasn't an act he did act like friendly he looked at me look he looked almost the evil and really
[3:00:56.160 --> 3:01:01.360]  manly and really scary looking and he said he goes there's gonna come a time for anybody because
[3:01:01.360 --> 3:01:06.640]  we were talking about his daughter who was working for ibm at the time and and how ibm's corrupt and
[3:01:06.640 --> 3:01:10.320]  he goes there's gonna come come a time for anybody where you've got a line you've got a cross that
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:14.000]  you're either gonna join it or you're not gonna cross it but you know you're gonna lose your soul
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:17.760]  and he said that for me it was in guatemala in 1980 whatever and i said well what was it
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:23.760]  he said it was children and orphanages and i said what wasn't he looked at me he said you know what
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:29.040]  it is you talk about it all the time but i wouldn't be part of it so even then the elements of the
[3:01:29.040 --> 3:01:35.840]  u.s. government the cia were involved shipping kids out of orphanages that disappeared they could
[3:01:37.040 --> 3:01:44.080]  you believe that now you see why they don't want a border wall and now you see why they're going
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:49.920]  over to libya destabilizing creating a refugee crisis now you see why their money from this nexium
[3:01:49.920 --> 3:01:55.280]  cult was propping up hillary clinton why they were constantly communicating with hillary clinton
[3:01:55.280 --> 3:02:01.520]  using the emissary of richard maze now you see what it's all about now you see why they put
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:06.000]  they literally handpicked kirsten jillibrand to be the senator from new york to lord over this to
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:10.320]  make sure that they didn't go down and even she proved weak because you know in the face of our
[3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:15.680]  citizen journalism and our truth and our righteousness now you see how it all ties together now you see
[3:02:15.680 --> 3:02:20.000]  why you're suffering in modernity now you see why you can't get ahead in this country because the
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:25.680]  small group of folks the satanic luciferians rigged everything using the wizardry of media and it's
[3:02:25.680 --> 3:02:30.000]  being called out and it's wonderful that it's being called out and they want to kill each other over
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:35.200]  what color we are instead of us coming after them for what they've done but then how do you deal with
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:39.680]  it when you're white as dr. pulcher robert said and the same program was saying jews are evil
[3:02:39.680 --> 3:02:43.520]  they're now saying white christian men are the worst thing on earth we shouldn't put up with this
[3:02:43.520 --> 3:02:48.080]  crap that doesn't mean go fight with dumb brainwashed black people that have been brainwashed by white
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:54.160]  liberals it means holding george soros and monsters like him accountable they are pathetic they're
[3:02:54.160 --> 3:03:00.240]  absolutely pathetic people and only the ignorance of the people through the wizardry of media keeps
[3:03:00.240 --> 3:03:06.000]  people enslaved that's it and so that's why the show is so important and that's why you know we are
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:11.360]  are um uh leading the way really all over the country all over the country people say i i saw you on
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:15.200]  the alex jones show i didn't realize these connections i didn't realize that it was all
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:19.200]  connected well just imagine the pain of my family there always was real christian came off real
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:23.600]  sweet nice and all of a sudden his face just changed and looked really aggressive and i don't
[3:03:23.600 --> 3:03:28.160]  say evil but scary and he just looked at me in that pickup truck because i was driving and he
[3:03:28.160 --> 3:03:33.840]  looked at me and he just started talking for about a minute about about it and it was so haunting to
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:39.680]  look on his face there's never been stability in my lifetime i was a kid i was a little kid i would
[3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:43.440]  have to go to school sit there with those marks that's i would go why why is the yellow bus taking
[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:47.760]  me to this awful place every single day and everybody's going around and and they they they
[3:03:47.760 --> 3:03:52.320]  trick you into thinking that it's stability this is the way it's always been oh another nine to five
[3:03:52.320 --> 3:03:58.000]  they have created this in modern times and one hour bells and and and all this stuff it's all
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:05.040]  pat lowly crap there's nothing more disheartening and demoralizing to a child than giving them 45
[3:04:05.040 --> 3:04:10.800]  let me say this there's nobody more mentally ill than them it's the inmates running the asylum
[3:04:10.800 --> 3:04:15.280]  i mean there's this online psychologist that i want to go after because he's so fake and he sits
[3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:20.640]  there and like like does analysis of myself and other people and he says these lies about me with
[3:04:20.640 --> 3:04:25.440]  this little fake simpering voice these are the mental patients these are the fraud these are the
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:29.600]  garbage and they think they're going to be fulfilled but they can only run our lives they can only

[3:06:55.040 --> 3:07:00.480]  if trump doesn't get elected they're still planning to bring us to our knees and really try to break

[3:07:05.120 --> 3:07:10.320]  already doing rounding up and arresting people that criticize what the left are doing that's the
[3:07:10.320 --> 3:07:15.120]  really bad news the good news is this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world and
[3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:20.400]  the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking so bottom line we're in the fight
[3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:26.080]  we're starting to win but it's serious so pray to god for a global awakening support info wars

[3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:41.840]  the way the psychological warfare operation works is very very simple
[3:07:42.720 --> 3:07:47.520]  they give you about freedoms by increments always promising it's only gonna be a short period of
[3:07:47.520 --> 3:07:54.240]  time and then the restrictions will be released but they're not ever significant amount of time
[3:07:54.240 --> 3:07:59.600]  always four or five times longer than what they said they will then slightly release it a little bit
[3:07:59.600 --> 3:08:06.000]  to only tighten it down even more later this is called successive approximation incrementalism
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:11.440]  or the inchworm effect this is the most common way that the talitarians take over but there then
[3:08:11.440 --> 3:08:16.960]  becomes a point where the public wakes up under the incrementalism he starts resisting and then
[3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:22.320]  there's usually a giant purge and a clamp down and you'll see more tyranny rolled out in just a
[3:08:22.320 --> 3:08:27.440]  few days weeks or months than you saw in the previous 10 years and that's the period we're in
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:33.360]  globally right now a world government chai combat globalist corporate takeover of the
[3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:37.440]  planet that once you pour an absolutely sick under their thumb forever
[3:08:37.440 --> 3:08:53.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:09:08.880]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host matt bracken
[3:09:12.880 --> 3:09:20.560]  okay uh it's good to be on been watching this show what powerful guests and believe me you are
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:26.560]  never going to see them on broadcast or cable television i mean this is just uh well it's
[3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:32.480]  why they want to shut down infowars basically because it's an unfiltered uncensored channel
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:41.920]  where the the cold hard truth can be broadcast full strength not watered down not adulterated
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:50.480]  this is it this is the full strength aqua vita right here now i just watched a couple hours ago
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:58.240]  a a new video by um that one youtube channel called black pigeon speaks uh philx rex and he
[3:09:58.240 --> 3:10:02.880]  spoke about something that that i really wasn't familiar with but it makes complete sense and
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:09.280]  when it i fit it into the pieces now it's like perfect part of the mosaic he said that throughout
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:15.920]  history affluent end-stage civilizations you know when they've conquered their their
[3:10:15.920 --> 3:10:22.480]  internal and external problems meaning everybody's fed everybody's got entertainment you know very
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:27.440]  few people are starving or or just living on the street unless they're mentally ill or have other
[3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:35.040]  problems these civilizations while they're ascending they they coalesce around opposition
[3:10:35.040 --> 3:10:41.920]  to an external enemy there's some foreign enemy once that civilization has conquered all comers
[3:10:42.720 --> 3:10:48.720]  as they begin to collapse these affluent end-stage societies they turn on themselves
[3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:55.600]  that there's some psychological need inside of groups of people to form against an enemy
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:11:00.800]  and if there's no outside enemy like we're not we don't hate on the chinese or the russians
[3:11:00.800 --> 3:11:06.400]  enough to think of them as our enemy even though our our deep state you know war machine people
[3:11:06.400 --> 3:11:11.280]  would love that we don't really feel it you know we're unless there was a pearl harbor or another
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:19.600]  9 11 we don't feel it so that need for an enemy turns inward and now it's it's the socialists
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:27.120]  versus the free market people or the the religious versus the the irreligious uh white versus black
[3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:34.560]  every fault line that they can that they can uh you know poor gasoline on pry bar apart they're
[3:11:34.560 --> 3:11:40.880]  doing it and it's also a part of a psychological phenomenon so it's very easy people want an
[3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:50.640]  enemy now we there is no doubt in my mind that october to november is the beginning of the final
[3:11:50.640 --> 3:12:00.080]  battle there's no doubt the deep state is going all in on this there is no plan b i i heard alex
[3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:06.640]  say if trump you know if trump wins i don't think that they think that trump will be allowed to win
[3:12:06.640 --> 3:12:16.400]  under any circumstance at all this is this is the the combination of communism and corporatism
[3:12:16.400 --> 3:12:24.800]  in the form of modern globalism and they are going to put the global clamp down on right now
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:32.800]  now there there was never an an empire as global as the american empire of the past you know since
[3:12:32.800 --> 3:12:42.160]  world war two america plus you know the english-speaking world western europe this had rolled the entire
[3:12:42.160 --> 3:12:49.760]  world into one economy even china folded into it in the last you know 30 years but now is the chance
[3:12:49.760 --> 3:12:57.680]  for the globalists to impose tyranny across the board and i have no doubt that they see this
[3:12:57.680 --> 3:13:06.640]  this period from now until january 20th as their window there's there's no plan b for trump as president
[3:13:06.640 --> 3:13:14.560]  they are going to do anything up to and including uh sabotage attacks against the power grid for
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:23.120]  example you know you couldn't have in-person polling day elections if for example the power went out
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:31.520]  in in cities and they can do this by by shooting out transformers blaming it blaming it on the
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:39.600]  the white racist proud boys you know the the uh the the great bogeyman they can turn out the power
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:47.520]  in urban cores say that it was done by the you know the evil white bogeyman and then say the
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:54.160]  elections totally invalid because they wouldn't let the urban the urban people vote i mean this
[3:13:54.160 --> 3:13:59.600]  is the level that they are willing to take it to have no doubt i mean the the hundred thousand
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:05.600]  that we know of ballots in new york and and i'm sure that's just a be an initial taste
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:13.360]  with wrong envelopes wrong names this is designed to fail it's not designed to work it's not a case
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:20.320]  of just people that did their best but they were a little bit incompetent this is designed to fail
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:27.360]  in philadelphia they're missing the the the software that programs their voting machines
[3:14:27.360 --> 3:14:34.480]  it turned up missing why do you think this is the election is designed to fail it's something that the
[3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:41.680]  that the left calls operation red mirage which is it might look like trump is going to be winning
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:48.400]  on election night but don't worry we're going to just use the election night results to determine
[3:14:48.400 --> 3:14:56.000]  in what states how many votes are we behind what you know where do we need to to find these mailed
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:03.360]  in ballots and sufficient numbers to turn the election that is absolutely the plan i saw today
[3:15:03.760 --> 3:15:10.880]  former general stanley mcrystal he's endorsing biden mcrystal is part of this cabal of x generals
[3:15:10.880 --> 3:15:17.840]  who's actually working for a company that is that's program is disinformation you know they
[3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:24.720]  they say that they always use the flip the reverse they say it's to combat trumps disinformation
[3:15:24.720 --> 3:15:30.880]  but it's that's bogus that's just like calling trump you know the russian colluder when it was
[3:15:30.880 --> 3:15:38.320]  hillary and the democrats it's always that flip so mcrystal i have no doubt was behind that whole
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:46.240]  trump said the troops are are losers and suckers that's a former general this is the level of
[3:15:46.240 --> 3:15:53.760]  of perfidy that these people are willing to go to to get rid of trump the swamp drainer the
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:15:59.920]  disruptor they want business back to usual and for the for the deep state they're just being
[3:15:59.920 --> 3:16:05.520]  used as pawns really because to the deep state people they think it'll be back to to the you
[3:16:05.520 --> 3:16:12.000]  know the gravey train the pentagon to corporate board million dollar payoff gravey train but
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:18.800]  they're just being used by the globalists who are going to take the take a biden victory and they
[3:16:18.800 --> 3:16:25.920]  have no doubt there's going to be a biden victory using joe biden as just a trojan horse for kamala
[3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:33.200]  harris aoc in the squad and as soon as they as soon as they're in power they're going to they're
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:39.360]  going to flip the switch on the filibuster and packing the supreme court when that happens
[3:16:39.360 --> 3:16:48.080]  america as we know it is over don't think well the the economy will be trashed so badly people
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:56.480]  will be so unhappy that in the next election you know in 2022 or 2024 we can reverse the democrat
[3:16:56.480 --> 3:17:04.320]  gains no that is not the plan the plan is to do it like venezuela take over the supreme court by
[3:17:04.320 --> 3:17:10.880]  packing it and after that the supreme court is nothing but a rubber stamp or any scheme of the
[3:17:10.880 --> 3:17:18.400]  democrats including one by one invalidating the bill of rights you know the first amendment will be
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:23.760]  no hate speech no promoting terrorism whatever they want to call it the second amendment will be
[3:17:24.320 --> 3:17:30.800]  guns are just too dangerous ordinary citizens you can keep your uh flintlock but nothing else
[3:17:30.800 --> 3:17:33.440]  and when we come back we're going to continue on this thing
[3:17:33.440 --> 3:17:42.400]  this is your last chance to get a pack power stack and i'm really bummed out about that
[3:17:42.400 --> 3:17:46.800]  it started out as a sleeper product but the people that did order it loved it and sort of
[3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:51.520]  reordering it they spread the word and became one of our best sellers but because of the covid
[3:17:51.520 --> 3:17:56.720]  supply chain breakdown and because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack we are
[3:17:56.720 --> 3:18:03.680]  unable to secure it anymore this is the highest in ampm pack system you're going to find where you
[3:18:03.680 --> 3:18:08.240]  take half the pills in the morning half the capitals and pills and gel caps at night it's amazing
[3:18:08.240 --> 3:18:12.720]  i don't have time to go into everything that's in it but this gets people to remember to take it
[3:18:12.720 --> 3:18:16.560]  and that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:21.920]  so it's your last chance to get a power stack at infowarstore.com it's 60% off and free shipping
[3:18:21.920 --> 3:18:26.320]  that is at cost for all you that already support info wars we're passing these savings onto you

[3:18:32.320 --> 3:18:41.840]  power stacks 60% off and free shipping remember the enemy is working around the clock to suppress
[3:18:41.840 --> 3:18:49.680]  voices of independent people all over the world the globalist have a plan for total vertical
[3:18:49.680 --> 3:18:59.360]  integration absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices of their control
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:06.320]  but that is only a means to an end once they have the electronic straightjacket in place
[3:19:06.320 --> 3:19:11.360]  they are on record that they will bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and your family
[3:19:11.360 --> 3:19:17.760]  and worse many of the vaccines being pushed by the united nations actually give people polio
[3:19:17.760 --> 3:19:24.320]  and actually give people cancer most cancer is viral that's a big secret but the secret is
[3:19:24.320 --> 3:19:31.440]  beginning to come out it's even in the associated press remember all of these banned videos and
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:38.640]  reports are banned on video but only you can share them and save humanity if you look at the top
[3:19:38.640 --> 3:19:44.240]  tech billionaires and the big banks that finance and control them to a man and to a woman they believe
[3:19:44.240 --> 3:19:48.000]  there's too many people on the earth and they constantly whine about when they want to go to
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:52.880]  a mountain top or an national park they have to look at us the common people they have to
[3:19:52.880 --> 3:19:57.280]  look at the proletariat they have to look at the scum that's why they love the lockdown
[3:19:57.280 --> 3:20:02.160]  putting mussels on us that gives them a big thrill controlling where we can go what we can do
[3:20:02.160 --> 3:20:08.720]  bankrupting main street bankrupting small towns all of it is a vertical integration consolidation
[3:20:08.720 --> 3:20:13.920]  so they can then dictate the terms of our total surrender which is taking sterilant vaccines
[3:20:13.920 --> 3:20:19.840]  day one ladies and gentlemen all the games are over play times over they used all the
[3:20:19.840 --> 3:20:24.800]  entertainment and garbage to put us into a trance and now the spider is moving in for the kill
[3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:29.680]  you know this i know this it's all out in the open the question is what are we gonna do about it
[3:20:29.680 --> 3:20:35.360]  well the first thing is identify the enemy identify the enemy identify the enemy identify your enemy
[3:20:35.360 --> 3:20:45.360]  now you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:45.360 --> 3:21:09.440]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:21:09.440 --> 3:21:18.480]  okay um we're gonna continue on the same subject because really there's nothing else
[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:24.400]  that's as important i mean there's a war breaking out in between armenia and azure by john a proxy
[3:21:24.400 --> 3:21:30.160]  war between turkey and russia turkey is the nato ally i don't think that matters china could invade
[3:21:30.160 --> 3:21:37.760]  taiwan the real arena is right here in the usa this is the main battle we're gearing up for the
[3:21:37.760 --> 3:21:44.640]  absolute main battle now november 3rd is just going to be when the democrats count how many
[3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:51.600]  bogus mail-in ballots they need to fabricate or find or locate and what's going to happen on
[3:21:51.600 --> 3:21:59.040]  on election night is social media and the mainstream media are going to clamp down on
[3:21:59.040 --> 3:22:04.560]  especially trump but anybody that's declaring trump a winner even if it's a landslide they're
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:09.280]  going to say that that's fake news that that you're you're gonna have to be fact-checked
[3:22:09.280 --> 3:22:15.040]  they're gonna block out anything about trump winning in a landslide this is why it's important
[3:22:15.040 --> 3:22:21.920]  now i don't i don't care if you're on twitter and facebook but get on gabin parlor we're going to
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:28.640]  need backup channels if you suddenly find yourself black blocked out or you can't get any information
[3:22:28.640 --> 3:22:34.400]  on facebook or twitter they're just canceling out conservatives use gabin parlor at least
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:41.440]  as backup channels get on now while you can for videos band dot video info wars video
[3:22:41.440 --> 3:22:48.000]  hosting site is terrific so is so is brady on and bit suit and other and other video hosting sites
[3:22:48.800 --> 3:22:56.400]  youtube is google okay gulag if you're only relying on youtube after election night
[3:22:56.400 --> 3:23:02.400]  you're not going to find any videos saying that trump won in a landslide potentially so get on
[3:23:02.400 --> 3:23:09.600]  the alternate channels while you can and really the only way out of this short of a shooting war is
[3:23:09.600 --> 3:23:15.840]  and i don't think it's very feasible i put it at like less than a 25 probability is trump
[3:23:15.840 --> 3:23:24.080]  winning in a total landslide that is way beyond the ability of of these democrat operatives to
[3:23:24.080 --> 3:23:30.960]  overturn by doing the al franken plan finding you know finding boxes of votes a week after the election
[3:23:30.960 --> 3:23:38.320]  and key in a few key states if it's a landslide you know in 40 states something on the level of
[3:23:38.320 --> 3:23:43.760]  nixon mcgovern or reagan mondale that's really the only way out but i don't think that it's very
[3:23:43.760 --> 3:23:52.160]  feasible and keep in mind also the senate is also super important if the democrats flip a couple of
[3:23:52.160 --> 3:23:58.480]  of republican senate seats the democrat then they are going to immediately cancel the filibuster
[3:23:58.480 --> 3:24:07.680]  meaning it'll just take 51 votes 51 49 and they can pass any law they can pass a law saying we're
[3:24:07.680 --> 3:24:15.200]  going to add five more justices to the supreme court and nancy polosi will agree and then
[3:24:15.200 --> 3:24:22.640]  we're just off to the races so once once they accomplish this packing the supreme court there
[3:24:22.640 --> 3:24:28.800]  is no other election that will ever matter in our lifetime unless it's on the other side of a
[3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:34.960]  bloody civil war this is what they did in venezuela and in other countries people would say don't
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:41.440]  worry hugo chavez will so mismanage the country will win in the next election no you won't because
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:45.760]  they're going to nail those doors shut in the meantime there won't be another meaningful
[3:24:45.760 --> 3:24:54.160]  election ever it's um there's a quote by erdogan of turkey he says he's a he's an islamist right
[3:24:54.160 --> 3:25:00.160]  he said democracy is like a train you take it to where you want to go and then you get off
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:07.040]  and so this is what the socialists in our country are doing they're using democracy as a train
[3:25:07.040 --> 3:25:13.520]  taking it to where they need to go which is get a majority in the senate so muddy the waters
[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:19.440]  between trump and biden that there's that there's possibly nobody going that that can be declared
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:26.560]  a winner each side declaring victory and eventually it goes to nancy polosi this is like a nightmare
[3:25:26.560 --> 3:25:32.960]  scenario but for the globalists it's a dream scenario so yeah the getting out and voting
[3:25:32.960 --> 3:25:39.120]  absolutely matters but i'm not sure that they're not they would stop at anything even if even if
[3:25:39.120 --> 3:25:44.560]  they're internal polling said you know trump is going to win in a landslide i wouldn't put things
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:50.560]  like sabotage and false flag operations off of the table that's how desperate they are and that's
[3:25:50.560 --> 3:25:57.040]  also kind of how sure they are even though they have no reason to be you know comey and his crowd
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:01.840]  thought after you know thought that hillary was going to win for sure and all their crimes would
[3:26:01.840 --> 3:26:07.440]  be hidden so they must be a little bit nervous now but they're probably thinking you know durham
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:12.880]  where's his report he's afraid to come out with it you know where's where's the where's the uh where
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:18.960]  the uh consequences for our coup against trump there aren't any and after biden is putting
[3:26:18.960 --> 3:26:25.520]  in the white house and then kamala harris takes over you know by summertime it'll be clear sailing
[3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:31.600]  after that you could even have comey and brennan back in government and boy they will be out for
[3:26:31.600 --> 3:26:39.440]  revenge they will be out for taking scalps but this is not venezuela this is more like
[3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:46.880]  switzerland where so much of the population is armed that a hugo a hugo chavez type takeover
[3:26:46.880 --> 3:26:54.160]  by packing the courts can't win here because americans will not accept it americans will will
[3:26:54.160 --> 3:27:03.200]  absolutely you know either secede from washington uh go on on uh tax strikes uh truckers will
[3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:09.680]  blockade highways going into cities it will be mayhem now from the globalist and the and
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:14.640]  especially the chinese communist and russian point of view this would be beautiful because
[3:27:14.640 --> 3:27:20.560]  they would love to see nothing better than america in you know blowing itself up and turning
[3:27:20.560 --> 3:27:26.640]  one itself in a civil war if that happens china just rolls over asia while we're too busy you
[3:27:26.640 --> 3:27:33.200]  know dealing with our own with our own home front so so believe me china would absolutely love to
[3:27:33.200 --> 3:27:39.600]  to you know stoke this explosion in any way possible and so would the russians we are their
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:45.680]  main enemy and the best way to defeat your enemy is have your enemy defeat itself that's like the
[3:27:45.680 --> 3:27:52.960]  ultimate jujitsu you don't even fight your enemy you get your enemy to destroy itself there's i
[3:27:52.960 --> 3:27:58.720]  don't think sun soon even had a category for that but that is absolutely what's coming now
[3:28:00.240 --> 3:28:07.200]  your goal with what i'm talking about in all of this is to stay ahead of this escalation
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:14.640]  don't be like the mcclossies in st louis who thought that the normal rules of civility and
[3:28:14.640 --> 3:28:20.480]  legal jurisprudence applied who were you know caught by shock when the mob came into their
[3:28:20.480 --> 3:28:27.840]  neighborhood be ready for this and anticipate the next stages in this escalation that's why
[3:28:27.840 --> 3:28:33.680]  i'm talking about things up to an including sabotage attacks on the power grid false flag
[3:28:33.680 --> 3:28:42.960]  operations you know be aware that this is planned to escalate in stages the antifas would do it
[3:28:42.960 --> 3:28:50.480]  already but they're attempting to keep control of the narrative by goading you know the quote unquote
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:56.640]  white supremacist boogie men into doing some violent action we can see it today i don't know
[3:28:56.640 --> 3:29:03.760]  if you've seen the uh john roberts fox reporter had a kind of a meltdown he went after um uh
[3:29:03.760 --> 3:29:10.240]  kyley macananny today over the white supremacy thing and then afterward he had a little bit of
[3:29:10.240 --> 3:29:16.480]  a meltdown because she tweeted about hey hey john roberts your wife who's an abc reporter
[3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:22.960]  already asked this yesterday and she and he did a freak out but but i mean this is how important
[3:29:22.960 --> 3:29:30.880]  to the deep state this narrative is that antifa and blm those are just peaceful protests 97
[3:29:30.880 --> 3:29:38.080]  percent peaceful those fires that's not much it's the proud boys those white racist proud boys
[3:29:38.080 --> 3:29:44.320]  even though they have you know many black and and hispanic leaders you know the proud boys are just
[3:29:44.320 --> 3:29:51.520]  proud americans they're not there's not a racial component to it but as far as as far as the narrative
[3:29:51.520 --> 3:29:58.240]  is concerned anything that doesn't support socialism that doesn't support blm and antifa
[3:29:58.240 --> 3:30:04.640]  is by definition you know white supremacist and nazi by definition and this is this brings
[3:30:04.640 --> 3:30:11.120]  up a great opportunity because we can shove such cognitive dissonance in the face of the socialists
[3:30:11.840 --> 3:30:18.000]  that they could that it'll lead them to a nervous breakdown by continually pointing out
[3:30:18.000 --> 3:30:23.360]  that leaders of the proud boy how can they be white supremacists they're black and hispanic
[3:30:23.360 --> 3:30:30.560]  in many cases you know is is candace owens a black a white supremacist anyway last segment
[3:30:30.560 --> 3:30:37.600]  coming up and we'll be back and finish up about what's coming next we've now entered month number
[3:30:37.600 --> 3:30:42.320]  eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation
[3:30:42.960 --> 3:30:49.120]  but the good news is it's caused a planetary awakening as well the general public all over
[3:30:49.120 --> 3:30:55.600]  the planet hate bill gates he's the most unpopular person on earth people know he's not a doctor
[3:30:55.600 --> 3:31:01.360]  people know he's a eugenicist the population knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled
[3:31:01.360 --> 3:31:08.320]  with cancer viruses polio sterilants and more it's even in the associated press so now they're
[3:31:08.320 --> 3:31:13.760]  beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate global government
[3:31:13.760 --> 3:31:18.800]  and the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war
[3:31:18.800 --> 3:31:25.360]  scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing so remember that and let them know that we know

[3:32:07.840 --> 3:32:15.840]  incremental tyranny we're facing absolute 100 commitment to evil because the system thinks

[3:32:19.920 --> 3:32:24.640]  uk or the us black lives matter funded by soros can run around and kill cops and burn things down

[3:34:04.800 --> 3:34:10.800]  doing on the apps as well including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:16.960]  like siri or alexa do and then putting databases transcripts of everything you say into those
[3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:21.760]  systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:27.200]  surveillance scores based on information this is the global chinese communist social credit score
[3:34:27.200 --> 3:34:32.960]  get your protection privacy pockets at info or short com and cut big brother off dead in his

[3:35:17.360 --> 3:35:25.440]  you can get them on uh on audible kindle and printed books but understand that audible and
[3:35:25.440 --> 3:35:33.280]  kindle anything that's considered subversive literature you know anti anti-government radical
[3:35:33.280 --> 3:35:38.640]  stuff in the coming years is probably going to be deleted from your device so i would really
[3:35:38.640 --> 3:35:44.560]  recommend getting hard copy and if you don't want to give jeff bezos half of your money you can you
[3:35:44.560 --> 3:35:51.440]  can get them from me using paypal uh you can find out how on my website but i'm just saying you're
[3:35:51.440 --> 3:35:56.720]  gonna want some books like this in hard copy because you know this might be like underground
[3:35:56.720 --> 3:36:04.880]  literature in years to come uh paul craig roberts who i've followed and read for years was on uh two
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:12.480]  guests ago paul he was fantastic too he was talking about how this critical race theory is being
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:21.200]  really used as an excuse for anti-white propaganda there's no other way to look at it you know
[3:36:21.200 --> 3:36:28.080]  intersectionalism it basically divides the population up it's exactly the opposite of
[3:36:28.080 --> 3:36:34.720]  a melting pot exactly the opposite intersectionalism means you're given points for how many you know
[3:36:34.720 --> 3:36:42.240]  oppression categories you can fit in you know so if you're a transsexual uh you know african-american
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:50.480]  uh you know midget you get a lot of points you know if if you're stupid you get more points you
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:57.040]  know they're actually trying to um uh say that things like you know scoring high on tests that's
[3:36:57.040 --> 3:37:02.560]  racist you know they're they're literally trying to dumb this population down to the point where
[3:37:03.200 --> 3:37:09.120]  uh i forget the uh name of the short story where the smartest strongest people had to wear weights
[3:37:09.760 --> 3:37:17.280]  what's uh drawn a mental blank but the the talented smart strong people had to literally
[3:37:17.280 --> 3:37:23.920]  be handicapped because everybody had to be brought down to the lowest level well if you're
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:29.360]  talking about the lowest level right now in this country you're looking at them right now
[3:37:30.640 --> 3:37:36.560]  i'm a white boomer male christian you know how many intersectional points that i get
[3:37:37.280 --> 3:37:44.320]  zero and this is in an era when when uh if you don't have any of these points people are pointing
[3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:50.160]  the finger at you and saying you wrecked our country they literally look at at uh you know white men
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:38:00.800]  over 50 as evil incarnate the antifa and blm crowd would i have no doubt eagerly load us on to trains
[3:38:00.800 --> 3:38:09.120]  to take us to gulags or like larry grathwell said 30 40 years ago about the weather underground
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:14.800]  that they might have to just get rid of 25 million americans or million americans who are just
[3:38:14.800 --> 3:38:22.160]  hardcore diehard you know would never convert capitalists they had a plan for us and it's just
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:29.760]  shovel ready as in in the ground that's the plan for us make no mistake and and the the very worst
[3:38:29.760 --> 3:38:35.600]  of all are us i mean you can you can see it with the knockout game did you ever see in your life
[3:38:35.600 --> 3:38:41.840]  where young people often of color just would sucker punch an old white lady or an old white man on
[3:38:41.840 --> 3:38:49.520]  the street it's because of this constant brainwashing where this this guy in philip in uh los angeles
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:56.320]  just walk up and shoot two cops in the face just shoot them in the face their people are being
[3:38:56.320 --> 3:39:04.560]  geared up to a rwanda level of of hatred in this country and it's extremely dangerous and make no
[3:39:04.560 --> 3:39:12.240]  doubt the reason have no doubt the reason why biden won't and will never uh condemn antifa or blm
[3:39:12.880 --> 3:39:20.160]  but instead try to flip that narrative to the you know the the proud boys who have never done
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:26.560]  any violence outside of getting involved in some scuffles started by antifa no buildings have been
[3:39:26.560 --> 3:39:33.920]  burned no police have been shot you know no innocent bystanders nobody you know beaten to death by
[3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:42.560]  the proud boys but the entire media even at box news with john roberts is trying to skew the narrative
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:50.640]  to where it's the evil whites that have to be suppressed even our very corrupt fbi christopher
[3:39:50.640 --> 3:39:57.760]  ray he's going along with his part of the narrative saying oh never mind antifa and blm the biggest
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:40:04.000]  threat are white supremacists where is this coming from you know what frequency are they on
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:12.240]  well the the goal is to not just try to understand the picture now but it's to
[3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:19.520]  project it out what is the goal what is the end game where are they taking this they are going to
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:28.560]  attempt to goad some white reaction you know kenosha kyle written house he was a good start he's
[3:40:28.560 --> 3:40:34.400]  kind of a boogeyman but it's hard to make a teenager who is clearly defending his life
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:42.000]  into what they need what they really want is is a white you know mass shooter that does it for
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:50.160]  racist reasons that is their wet dream that is their their nirvana to get that so we got we have to
[3:40:50.160 --> 3:40:57.680]  in the in the in the month before the election avoid at all costs giving them that bait you know
[3:40:57.680 --> 3:41:04.000]  giving them that gift on a platter of that you know white racist boogeyman that they are searching
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:12.160]  high and low for instead do the flip back on them show these show the and i'm i don't like having to
[3:41:12.160 --> 3:41:19.280]  put things into racial terms but sometimes you're left with no alternative i mean it's not our
[3:41:19.280 --> 3:41:24.800]  character we want the melting pot not this intersectional everybody against everybody
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:32.320]  narrative of the left but show them the black and hispanic proud boys you know put in their face
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:39.760]  that it's ridiculous to say that that militias and white supremacism are the same thing it's
[3:41:39.760 --> 3:41:47.440]  insanity so we have a lot of real war preparation to get ready for but we also are involved in a
[3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:54.640]  very strong psychological war right now so and what can you do well please don't just post on
[3:41:54.640 --> 3:42:00.480]  facebook and twitter because it's going to be shut down for you you know get those backup channels
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:06.960]  video and and social media get on the backup channels though it might be critical in the
[3:42:06.960 --> 3:42:12.720]  days after the election to have free truth spreading around and you know gabin parlor are
[3:42:12.720 --> 3:42:20.080]  not as big as facebook and twitter but 90 of the people on facebook and twitter are knuckleheads
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:26.480]  who are just following whatever the Kardashians or lebron james said yesterday the people that
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:31.520]  the people that are on gabin parlor are our people they're the ones that are already tuning
[3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:38.720]  into info wars yeah so so get on these channels and extend your voice in that period when they're
[3:42:38.720 --> 3:42:44.240]  going to try to shut your voice down and then another concept i want to get into a little bit
[3:42:44.240 --> 3:42:49.520]  because there's no doubt we are in for a full blown color revolution you know like in in
[3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:56.640]  ukraine or many other countries they are going to say that trump isn't is trying to steal the
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:43:02.240]  election he won't leave the white house they're going to organize you know mass riots that are
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:07.760]  going to be worse than anything we've seen and they're going to try to draw in you know a reaction
[3:43:07.760 --> 3:43:14.400]  from conservatives to make it look like germany in the 1930s you know with the with the communists
[3:43:14.400 --> 3:43:20.880]  versus the national socialists and then have the military come in to restore order and we've seen
[3:43:20.880 --> 3:43:28.000]  how many of the military are already co-opted by the left stanley mccrystal just being one example
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:35.920]  milley esfur these people are absolutely not in trump's uh wheelhouse you know he's like a captain
[3:43:35.920 --> 3:43:41.920]  of the ship he can give the orders but down in the engine room they just give him the finger and say
[3:43:41.920 --> 3:43:47.760]  you say forward we put it in reverse that's what ray is doing promoting this false narrative of the
[3:43:47.760 --> 3:43:53.840]  white racist boogeyman you know trump is not even fully in control even though he's been president
[3:43:53.840 --> 3:44:00.480]  for three and a half years and these deep state operatives they are banking everything on keeping
[3:44:00.480 --> 3:44:05.760]  on getting trump out of the white house and getting the deep state back fully in control
[3:44:05.760 --> 3:44:13.040]  and that's not the worst of it because with the deep state fully in control they are going to go for
[3:44:13.840 --> 3:44:19.040]  ending the filibuster that means the senate and congress can pass laws by one vote
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:25.440]  then pack the supreme court bring in dc and portorico there's four more
[3:44:26.160 --> 3:44:33.440]  democrat senators forever and it's done we will never have another election that matters
[3:44:33.440 --> 3:44:40.480]  in our lifetimes unless it's on the other side of a shooting civil war that's the stakes right now
[3:44:41.120 --> 3:44:47.760]  i mean it can't be any more clear than this and if they win and if you are like me you know
[3:44:47.760 --> 3:44:55.280]  a white christian boomer conservative have no doubt they will be coming for us because
[3:44:55.280 --> 3:45:01.680]  once they release the dragon of this angel of this anger of this hatred they have to feed it
[3:45:01.680 --> 3:45:09.040]  it and they're going to feed us to that dragon just like in germany with the jews or in the
[3:45:09.040 --> 3:45:15.040]  soviet union with the kulaks you know the the quote unquote wealthy farmers independent farmers
[3:45:15.040 --> 3:45:34.960]  they were fed into the dragon and that will be us okay i guess that's it for today and see you next time
