[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:12.200 --> 00:13.200]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:13.200 --> 00:15.800]  This is going to be a very important transmission.
[00:15.800 --> 00:16.800]  Stay with us.
[00:16.800 --> 00:20.240]  Here's John Bowne's report on last night's historic speech.
[00:20.240 --> 00:24.040]  We are one people with one destiny.
[00:24.040 --> 00:26.800]  We all bleed the same blood.
[00:26.800 --> 00:39.800]  We all salute the same great American flag, and we all are made by the same God.
[00:39.800 --> 00:44.640]  An epic speech to the joint session of Congress and the American people that Ivanka Trump
[00:44.640 --> 00:50.200]  had a hand in writing, President Donald J. Trump straddled party lines and solidified
[00:50.200 --> 00:54.120]  his position as the nation's bold commander-in-chief.
[00:54.120 --> 01:01.240]  When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will
[01:01.240 --> 01:09.120]  look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began.
[01:09.120 --> 01:12.680]  The time for small thinking is over.
[01:12.680 --> 01:16.720]  The time for trivial fights is behind us.
[01:16.720 --> 01:22.680]  The crybullies on the left were shaken as they watched their globalist dream turn into
[01:22.680 --> 01:25.240]  new ash before their very eyes.
[01:25.240 --> 01:31.240]  Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions
[01:31.240 --> 01:38.440]  of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.
[01:38.440 --> 01:46.520]  You didn't feel one thing that you can stand behind this morning?
[01:46.520 --> 01:53.160]  I was touched by the mention of the widow of the brave soldier who died in Yemen and
[01:53.160 --> 02:00.280]  things like that, but no, it's hard to see any place where the president actually has
[02:00.280 --> 02:02.400]  done something for working people.
[02:02.400 --> 02:08.960]  Ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.
[02:08.960 --> 02:15.000]  The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.400]  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media.
[02:19.400 --> 02:22.880]  In its conclusion, I thought it was a very unrealistic speech.
[02:22.880 --> 02:28.040]  I thought it was very divisive, and I was saddened by the direction that it went.
[02:28.040 --> 02:33.840]  He came with no ideas or an agenda for the American people tonight.
[02:33.840 --> 02:43.160]  We are watching this president take people and dehumanize them in terms of immigration
[02:43.160 --> 02:48.920]  and those types of things, in terms of the inner cities when he constantly harps on Chicago.
[02:48.920 --> 02:58.120]  We know there are issues in this country, but to dehumanize people in certain communities
[02:58.120 --> 03:02.400]  is not the way to be Commander-in-Chief, the leader of this nation.
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.480]  He talked about bringing it together, but all we see is a constant division by this
[03:07.480 --> 03:08.480]  president.
[03:08.480 --> 03:17.160]  Where's the meat, where's the money, or Congressman Engel, who earlier today indicated that he
[03:17.160 --> 03:22.440]  would not shake President Trump's hand, a tradition that goes back in many, many decades
[03:22.440 --> 03:27.800]  for you here in the State of the Union speeches, speeches to joint sessions.
[03:27.800 --> 03:30.760]  Tell us about some of your thinking on that, Congressman Engel.
[03:30.760 --> 03:37.000]  Well, I've been appalled at a lot of the things that the president and his administration
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.880]  has been doing for the past 40 days.
[03:39.880 --> 03:46.880]  And I just felt that to go there as I have for the past 28 years and pretend its business
[03:46.880 --> 03:53.120]  as usual would just be untrue and unfair and wrong for me to do it.
[03:53.120 --> 03:57.880]  We are supposed to have a free and independent press and Freedom of Speech First Amendment
[03:57.880 --> 03:58.880]  rights.
[03:58.880 --> 04:01.600]  He bars the press from his press conferences.
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.720]  He singles out stations and newspapers that he doesn't like.
[04:06.720 --> 04:11.520]  When you're president of the United States, you know, you are there for the papers to
[04:11.520 --> 04:12.520]  write whatever they want.
[04:12.520 --> 04:13.520]  No, don't just get first in line.
[04:13.520 --> 04:14.520]  Nobody reads them.
[04:14.520 --> 04:15.520]  He wants you to sign them or nobody reads them.
[04:15.520 --> 04:16.520]  Care acted.
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.520]  The questions about his ties to Russia and to Putin, these are all very troubling things.
[04:20.520 --> 04:21.520]  The intelligence committee says it's bull.
[04:21.520 --> 04:27.600]  He just felt that I had to in some way show my protest, and that was the way I showed him.
[04:27.600 --> 04:31.520]  In terms of the president's speech, it was very disappointing that the only time he
[04:31.520 --> 04:38.720]  mentioned Muslims was to relate to Islamic terrorism or Islamic radicals.
[04:38.720 --> 04:39.920]  So that was disappointing.
[04:39.920 --> 04:46.760]  No less than 23 Democratic Senate seats are up for re-election in 2018, along with two
[04:46.760 --> 04:48.320]  independent seats.
[04:48.320 --> 04:54.280]  If the Democrats continue to flap their elitist jaws, the Democratic Party may begin to border
[04:54.280 --> 04:55.400]  on extinction.
[04:55.400 --> 05:07.280]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower, last night's Trump
[05:07.280 --> 05:13.160]  speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and
[05:13.160 --> 05:15.640]  lack of respect for the country.
[05:15.640 --> 05:21.080]  Right after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects like
[05:21.080 --> 05:27.640]  Michael Moore appeared on television to bash Donald Trump, this time for honoring, wait
[05:27.640 --> 05:29.640]  for it, veterans.
[05:29.640 --> 05:31.680]  I'm going to get an Emmy for this.
[05:31.680 --> 05:35.480]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
[05:35.480 --> 05:38.400]  I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[05:38.400 --> 05:43.760]  Meanwhile, other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted vulgar remarks
[05:43.760 --> 05:50.160]  on Twitter, calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.680]  that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.
[05:53.680 --> 06:22.880]  I'm Darren McBrain and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[06:22.880 --> 06:51.820]  Thanks
[06:51.820 --> 06:57.940]  That made us what we were and this is a big part of it. I know you're gonna want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[06:57.940 --> 06:59.860]  And for worse life calm today
[06:59.860 --> 07:07.180]  You're investing in your health and supporting the info war when you visit info worse life calm and purchase your supply of survival shield x2
[07:07.180 --> 07:11.100]  nation iodine and all the great products then for worse life calm as you know
[07:11.100 --> 07:13.900]  We've talked to pharmacists chemists doctors researchers
[07:14.260 --> 07:20.460]  Scientists and the answer is clear iodine is key is paramount and there's still so much new information
[07:20.460 --> 07:25.740]  Coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine
[07:25.740 --> 07:33.420]  We drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine on top of that
[07:33.420 --> 07:36.540]  We also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling
[07:36.540 --> 07:40.060]  It is the purest cleanest strongest out there quite frankly
[07:40.060 --> 07:47.540]  I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nason iodine that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get
[07:47.540 --> 07:52.100]  Our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have
[07:52.100 --> 07:59.380]  It is exclusive to info wars life calm and the info wars life family of incredible products
[07:59.380 --> 08:16.620]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the GCN radio network
[08:21.620 --> 08:23.620]  Well donald trump
[08:24.420 --> 08:26.420]  Has certainly entered the danger zone
[08:26.420 --> 08:32.500]  We have two more countries in Europe today
[08:33.940 --> 08:38.780]  Announcing that they may begin the process of pulling out of the European Union
[08:39.740 --> 08:41.740]  And we've got nationalists
[08:41.900 --> 08:47.300]  You know basically every European country northern western eastern southern
[08:48.300 --> 08:50.300]  winning seats in parliament and
[08:50.860 --> 08:54.540]  taking the pole position for big wins in
[08:54.540 --> 09:02.180]  The presidencies as well as well as prime ministerships and you see America leading the way
[09:03.460 --> 09:06.100]  In expanding this nationalistic
[09:07.540 --> 09:12.140]  Self-determination of individuals and cultures through their countries in
[09:13.140 --> 09:19.340]  Defense of liberty and in a fight with the dehumanizing globalist
[09:19.340 --> 09:23.540]  Now there is so much to get to and cover here. Wow
[09:25.140 --> 09:29.140]  What a what a speech yesterday
[09:31.140 --> 09:32.140]  By president trump
[09:33.580 --> 09:41.540]  On january 20th 2017 he became the 45th president of the United States and announced his intentions
[09:42.740 --> 09:43.740]  To right the ship
[09:43.740 --> 09:47.740]  Of the united states of america on february 28th
[09:49.740 --> 09:55.740]  Less than 45 days later on february 28th 2017
[09:58.740 --> 10:04.740]  He took full command and began to actually right the ship and already in just that little amount of time
[10:04.740 --> 10:10.740]  We have already been taken off this collision course of collapse and the end of the war
[10:10.740 --> 10:14.740]  This collision course of collapse and the end of our sovereignty
[10:14.740 --> 10:16.740]  I won't say he's right of the ship yet
[10:17.740 --> 10:22.740]  Because we're in dangerous waters and surrounded by enemies, but we have a lot of friends and
[10:23.740 --> 10:30.740]  Humanity again is awakening right at the darkest moment as we do throughout history over and over and over again
[10:30.740 --> 10:32.740]  And history is repeating itself
[10:34.740 --> 10:36.740]  I got to tell you though
[10:36.740 --> 10:43.740]  We finished up our live coverage at about 10 30 last night. I went home brush my teeth
[10:44.740 --> 10:46.740]  Got a glass of water and climbed into bed
[10:47.740 --> 10:49.740]  And I woke up this morning
[10:50.740 --> 10:55.740]  And I went to info wars calm. I went to drudge report calm. I checked the email
[10:55.740 --> 11:04.740]  I looked at the twitter and it was just democrats everywhere saying horrible things nasty things calling for trumps death
[11:04.740 --> 11:06.740]  Making fun of
[11:08.740 --> 11:12.740]  Mrs. Owens who lost her husband William Ryan Owens
[11:14.740 --> 11:21.740]  And calling her an idiot calling her stupid calling her a fool
[11:21.740 --> 11:23.740]  Michael Moore
[11:23.740 --> 11:29.740]  Attacking Trump saying he's fake how dare him you know invoke the troops and use them
[11:29.740 --> 11:34.740]  Trump has always since he grew up as a kid his dab was a big booster of the military
[11:34.740 --> 11:39.740]  Admired people that are in the military and admired combat veterans for their courage
[11:39.740 --> 11:44.740]  He's a guy that's into being manly being honorable not being a coward. You've seen him on the campaign trail
[11:44.740 --> 11:49.740]  You've seen him fulfill his promises. You've seen him stand up for what he believes in. He's an honorable man
[11:49.740 --> 11:57.740]  And in the world of creatures like Chris Matthews and Michael Moore and slime bags
[11:57.740 --> 12:04.740]  Who are absolutely backstabbing hypocritical filth who have bodyguards that but don't want you to have your own second amendment
[12:04.740 --> 12:09.740]  Trump gravitates towards folks that have been in the military
[12:09.740 --> 12:28.740]  Just like anybody who's lived or experienced life knows that on average people that are veterans and people that have seen a lot of combat are more honorable and more serious and more focused than the jellyfish that populate this domesticated spoiled rotten nation
[12:28.740 --> 12:42.740]  And I'm not calling everybody jellyfish, but let's all face it every statistic shows it. We don't know how to skin a buck around a trot line on average. We don't know how to fix a car or truck. We don't know how to roof our house or fix the plumbing or rewire stuff
[12:42.740 --> 12:52.740]  We don't know how to plan a crop. We don't know how to kick ass. We don't know how to shoot a gun on average like we did our predecessors
[12:52.740 --> 13:04.740]  So it's not putting us down so that we all feel pathetic or so I feel good, you know, bad mouthing the fact that so many people in the country are domesticated jellyfish
[13:04.740 --> 13:15.740]  It's it's a important fact so that we get up off of our butts collectively and start getting back to things that are grassroots and stop just watching television all day
[13:15.740 --> 13:28.740]  And stop just obsessing over Hollywood and all these stupid, you know, music so-called icons that are selling us a globalist agenda of cultural collapse by design
[13:31.740 --> 13:38.740]  So it's that simple and Trump's trying to get us back to our roots. That's not back in the past. Our roots are what grow into the future
[13:38.740 --> 13:52.740]  The roots are the future. The roots are the cycle of birth, living, building, striving, having children, living, striving, dying and the cycle over and over again
[13:52.740 --> 14:03.740]  That cycle is under scientific attack. That is in a statement bashing people that have a quote different sexual preference
[14:03.740 --> 14:13.740]  The issue is targets lost $15 billion since they started pushing the transgender agenda and won't have a girl's section of toys and a boy's section of toys
[14:13.740 --> 14:23.740]  And they're now trying to merge the clothing. That's a cult taking what's normal and natural and trying to force you into basically cult jumpsuits
[14:23.740 --> 14:25.740]  Cults always do that
[14:26.740 --> 14:30.740]  Disney Channel cartoon features network first same sex kiss
[14:30.740 --> 14:38.740]  This is for your seven-year-old, but notice it's not just that the boys are kissing and the girls are kissing
[14:38.740 --> 14:46.740]  In the video we're going to play a boy and a girl are kissing and they feel alone because everybody else see peer pressure
[14:46.740 --> 14:51.740]  See it's peer pressure. It's not it's okay of a boy and a boy were kissing or a girl and a girl were kissing
[14:51.740 --> 14:58.740]  It's no no no. Everybody else is not going to procreate. Everybody else isn't going to build a nest and have children
[14:58.740 --> 15:06.740]  Just like when you want to kill fire ants you put in a system to kill their sexual reproduction where you want to get rid of any other pest
[15:06.740 --> 15:13.740]  You shut down the reproductive cycle. They're saying just like the cover of National Geographic the eugenics publication
[15:14.740 --> 15:23.740]  They have all the new genders but not a woman not a woman with a uterus because that's the real power in the universe
[15:23.740 --> 15:29.740]  That's that's that's God's big creation right there
[15:29.740 --> 15:35.740]  That's a magic machine right there. No no no no see what do they tell you there by omission
[15:35.740 --> 15:41.740]  How do they lie to you by omission they don't show you the woman
[15:41.740 --> 15:48.740]  And right here everybody else you see that's how that works
[15:48.740 --> 15:53.740]  That's how that works but they also trick it to make it look like it's two girls but really the archetypal image is
[15:53.740 --> 15:58.740]  It's a boy and a girl and you watch the clip that's basically what it's doing
[15:58.740 --> 16:03.740]  This is the system that's being sold. Do you think they care they lost 15 million dollars a target? No
[16:03.740 --> 16:09.740]  Because it's omission. It's a system of social control
[16:09.740 --> 16:18.740]  Target is a social engineering company in their own corporate filings and the retail is their side business
[16:18.740 --> 16:22.740]  Look it up
[16:22.740 --> 16:27.740]  Very very sinister ladies and gentlemen very very hardcore
[16:27.740 --> 16:33.740]  And you've got the Washington Post fake news partner with the CIA there's a big article by John Robbaport on Infowars.com
[16:33.740 --> 16:42.740]  600 million publicly of taxpayer money given by Obama
[16:42.740 --> 16:48.740]  So Bezos can run around and engage in propaganda and you wonder why the Washington Post puts out lies and put out a fake list
[16:48.740 --> 16:52.740]  Saying ban info wars, ban drudge, then lawsuits got started
[16:52.740 --> 16:58.740]  It's just discriminatory. Where's your proof? Where's your court of law? You're trying to shut me out of the market
[16:58.740 --> 17:02.740]  You're trying to shut us out of the market place of ideas
[17:02.740 --> 17:08.740]  So they pulled it down but they don't care add rolls just going to use that list and ban people from advertising on the Google platform
[17:08.740 --> 17:16.740]  This is how they put you on those electronic gulags that Matt Drudge came here and warned everybody about 15 months ago
[17:16.740 --> 17:19.740]  And now it's all come true
[17:19.740 --> 17:23.740]  But one thing didn't come true Hillary didn't get in
[17:23.740 --> 17:27.740]  So they're going out with all their propaganda all the new TV shows there's like four of them out now
[17:27.740 --> 17:33.740]  Where the there's a woman president and there's evil right wingers trying to kill her an evil talk show host
[17:33.740 --> 17:36.740]  That have got to be stopped who talk just like this
[17:36.740 --> 17:42.740]  And say you are the resistance we're going to stop this female president we're coming after we're going to get her
[17:42.740 --> 17:47.740]  It's not just homeland there's a bunch of other shows everywhere
[17:47.740 --> 17:57.740]  Rolling it out and all these books published were Hillary won and Chelsea takes control of the World Health Organization of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[17:57.740 --> 18:05.740]  And we have a global government in their words to make us take our shots and make us eat our GMO
[18:05.740 --> 18:08.740]  But see it didn't go according to plan did it?
[18:08.740 --> 18:15.740]  The best laid plans of mice and me and often go astray
[18:15.740 --> 18:20.740]  So I want to walk through and skip this break I want to walk through the historic speech last night
[18:20.740 --> 18:26.740]  Get into a lot of other news but it fundamentally shows the nastiness
[18:26.740 --> 18:40.740]  That Obama could say he supports the troops and the military even as he dismantled it even as he funded our enemies and tried to overthrow countries that were allied with the United States and allied with freedom
[18:40.740 --> 18:48.740]  Still the libertarians the right wingers they never made an issue out of it when Obama during state of the unions and speeches would single out the military
[18:48.740 --> 19:01.740]  Like you do in any country people for service and those that have gone above and beyond the call of duty
[19:01.740 --> 19:07.740]  And it just shows though we have class they don't they come out and they say oh Trump doesn't really like the military
[19:07.740 --> 19:16.740]  He's just cold-bloodedly manipulating them you see the reason Trump is winning is he does care about the people and he's not just having rhetoric he's doing it
[19:16.740 --> 19:22.740]  When you turn the coal power plants back on and give everybody cheaper electricity that truly helps everyone
[19:22.740 --> 19:33.740]  When you don't let China and others have one sided trade deals that helps the country when you get over a hundred companies like Intel and Hasbro and the list goes on and on
[19:33.740 --> 19:38.740]  That's just the last week to announce they're coming back to the United States with trillions of dollars of investment
[19:38.740 --> 19:42.740]  It's not billions and billions or hundreds of billions Trump wanted to be conservative
[19:42.740 --> 19:49.740]  The stock market's already and the president corrected me I keep saying 2.3 trillion in the stock market I looked it up
[19:49.740 --> 20:04.740]  As of yesterday it's 2.9 trillion plus it's almost 3 trillion dollars in the last several months since he got elected and even Bloomberg had to admit
[20:04.740 --> 20:17.740]  90 plus percent of that money is coming from small businesses and small firms and people knowing they've got to get behind this and invest in the future of their communities their states their nation their world
[20:17.740 --> 20:27.740]  And I've said this for many years we're rallying patriots worldwide we're not promoting the US military going around and taking over countries
[20:27.740 --> 20:45.740]  We're promoting the ideas of our republic and the renaissance exploding by example as they did before and to be the shining city on the hill and the world adopting our ideas of free open societies because it's superior
[20:45.740 --> 21:04.740]  Imagine how powerful China'd be if they adopted our system we're trying to just get back to the revolutionary system it's not the old 240 you know two year old thing oh it's old no it's the newest slickest wildest experiment ever and it paid off
[21:04.740 --> 21:10.740]  Like a slot machine that comes up cherries all the way across
[21:10.740 --> 21:18.740]  Boom victory royal flush the trump card all of its there
[21:18.740 --> 21:36.740]  And so they then say oh Trump's empty he's fake well let's just say that's true which it isn't you're the nasty people making fun of a woman who we knew isn't fake
[21:36.740 --> 21:45.740]  Mrs. Owens who just lost her husband a few weeks ago in raids that had been green lighted eight months ago
[21:45.740 --> 21:59.740]  When Trump wasn't even in office by the Joint Chiefs by the Pentagon by special operations and Obama said no on a target list of hundreds of targets
[21:59.740 --> 22:08.740]  I knew about this before it was obviously even in the news we talked to him about on the air the fact that Trump was going to move against terrorists that wasn't a secret
[22:08.740 --> 22:15.740]  And actually go after the command and control not just fire them randomly in the field wherever the cowards pop up
[22:15.740 --> 22:28.740]  And so Trump went to the CIA he went to the Pentagon he got his Secretary of Defense in and within 48 hours they began attacking those targets they didn't announce it in the news like others would do in the past
[22:28.740 --> 22:43.740]  And out of all those raids what are they saying like four people been killed I mean that's what they signed up for that's what they wanted to do
[22:43.740 --> 22:52.740]  So you get the liberal dad he's upset but the wife's not she knows what her husband wanted to do that's what he signed up for
[22:52.740 --> 22:58.740]  That's what Trump signed up for and promised to do another promise delivered
[22:58.740 --> 23:13.740]  So they try to steal someone that laid their life down to stand up against bullies people that sell women into sex slavery that cut their genitals off that throw gay people off buildings that blow up churches that blow up non radical Muslims that run around bullying everybody
[23:13.740 --> 23:36.740]  And the media tries to basically crap all over it so let's go unedited to the raw clip here of Trump singling singling out the veterans and of course the fallen and particularly
[23:36.740 --> 23:40.740]  William Ryan Owens the Navy SEAL that died in the Yemen raid here it is
[23:40.740 --> 23:51.740]  We are blessed to be joined tonight by Corinne Owens the widow of US Navy special operator senior chief William Ryan Owens
[23:51.740 --> 24:11.740]  Ryan died as he lived a warrior and a hero battling against terrorism and securing our nation
[24:11.740 --> 24:24.740]  We call him this sick honoring the widow of someone that died going after al-Qaeda that's what ISIS is so she gets a two minute standing ovation she's thinking about her husband
[24:24.740 --> 24:29.740]  And this is all extremely genuine they say it's not
[24:29.740 --> 24:49.740]  Our great general Mattis just now who reconfirmed that and I quote Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy
[24:49.740 --> 24:55.740]  Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity thank you
[24:55.740 --> 25:01.740]  And as they raided the main base commanding forces not just there but all over the Middle East and Africa
[25:01.740 --> 25:09.740]  A command nest and so people got killed probably because it was leaked by people inside the CIA that's the word
[25:09.740 --> 25:19.740]  Like they believe that to try to set Trump up just like Kennedy in the Bay of Pigs there's a civil war going on
[25:19.740 --> 25:27.740]  There he is comforting her giving her the support of the tribe and they don't want us to have an American tribe and a unified
[25:27.740 --> 25:35.740]  They want us to be little globalist minions they even are mad when he says we're America first in the speech they go no we want globalism
[25:35.740 --> 25:40.740]  Like Glenn Beck said oh it's bad to say we even have a country it's scary
[25:40.740 --> 25:52.740]  That there's so many traders like you Beck is what's scary look at that beautiful woman she lost her husband this is all soothing her for a whole lifetime right now
[25:52.740 --> 26:02.740]  Transmuting the pain into victory in a ritual one of the oldest human rituals when the warriors don't come back getting around the tribe and honoring them
[26:02.740 --> 26:14.740]  Trump is bringing back all the ancient rituals the rites of passage this is powerful this is cleansing this is good and of course the devils don't like it
[26:14.740 --> 26:20.740]  Oh there's articles everywhere that I'm crazy and believe that witches are after Trump you saw it all over the news last week
[26:20.740 --> 26:26.740]  But Jones is crazy and believes in imaginary devil worshipers that don't like Trump
[26:26.740 --> 26:33.740]  That's how dumb they think you are taking everything out of context same thing they do to Trump
[26:33.740 --> 26:37.740]  Powerful keep going
[26:37.740 --> 26:47.740]  And Ryan is looking down right now you know that and he's very happy because I think he just broke a record
[26:47.740 --> 26:59.740]  Totally off script Trump doesn't follow scripts that's why Trump so powerful is he just goes with his gut he goes with being real
[26:59.740 --> 27:08.740]  He goes with that genuineness that you can't stop if the people get behind it and the whole world feels it and everywhere
[27:08.740 --> 27:19.740]  There are announcing secession movements that are now taking control in Poland in Hungary
[27:19.740 --> 27:27.740]  There are even movements in Turkey that went out of the EU good there are movements now taking control in the Netherlands
[27:27.740 --> 27:35.740]  In the lead to be the new president same thing in France way in the lead Le Pen Gert Wilders it's happening everywhere
[27:35.740 --> 27:42.740]  But they try to make it look dirty and weird and evil and coming up we're going to play the clip where they're just it's horrible
[27:42.740 --> 27:51.740]  And the Democrats wouldn't even stand when he talked about doing things for America and building infrastructure here not overseas and getting our shop in order
[27:51.740 --> 27:58.740]  Oh no they can't stand for that or talking about getting jobs for Americans or veterans the Democrats can't stand for that
[27:58.740 --> 28:02.740]  And they look like spoiled rotten mentally ill babies
[28:02.740 --> 28:10.740]  Now let's go to a really truly wicked person who knows what he's doing and that's Michael Moore
[28:10.740 --> 28:20.740]  Michael Moore let's go to Michael Moore on the guy that says he gets sexually excited when he sees Obama
[28:20.740 --> 28:28.740]  Chris Matthews talking about Trump being an opportunist how dare him bring up the veterans here we go
[28:28.740 --> 28:33.740]  A very poignant moment about the widow who's looked like a wonderful person for him to love with her husband
[28:33.740 --> 28:37.740]  She lost and he says well he'll be happy up there and have it in how many minutes of applause he got
[28:37.740 --> 28:51.740]  Ryan Owens his death came as a result of a dinner Trump had with his son-in-law and a political hack
[28:51.740 --> 28:53.740]  He made a decision in a dinner
[28:53.740 --> 29:01.740]  He went over dinner with Bannon and Jared and then denied having a role in it
[29:01.740 --> 29:09.740]  And then the reporting here on NBC News and other networks and papers of how the intelligence community said we got nothing out of this
[29:09.740 --> 29:13.740]  That's what happened so I'm not going to hold him against that
[29:13.740 --> 29:20.740]  But then lie tonight to say oh we got all this treasure trove and using the widow
[29:20.740 --> 29:24.740]  But he was set up in the argument where it was a factful mission or not
[29:24.740 --> 29:31.740]  Yeah of course and that's why she's there as a sort of a few to the people who are criticizing him for this
[29:31.740 --> 29:36.740]  And this poor woman this widow who has lost her husband she is in desperate grief right now
[29:36.740 --> 29:37.740]  She's in love with her husband still
[29:37.740 --> 29:38.740]  And in love with her husband
[29:38.740 --> 29:39.740]  And what did you think of that
[29:39.740 --> 29:44.740]  And to use that as just put another notch on his belt and what's he thinking about my ratings
[29:44.740 --> 29:49.740]  We're going to come back and expose this lying pig on the other side
[29:49.740 --> 29:53.740]  We're on the march the Empire's on the run
[29:53.740 --> 29:56.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:01.740 --> 30:05.740]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower
[30:05.740 --> 30:15.740]  Last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country
[30:15.740 --> 30:19.740]  But after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress
[30:19.740 --> 30:25.740]  The usual suspects like Michael Moore appeared on television to bash Donald Trump
[30:25.740 --> 30:29.740]  This time for honoring wait for it veterans
[30:29.740 --> 30:31.740]  I'm going to get an Emmy for this
[30:31.740 --> 30:35.740]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch
[30:35.740 --> 30:38.740]  I mean this is the sickness of this man
[30:38.740 --> 30:47.740]  While other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted vulgar remarks on Twitter calling the widow honored during Trump's speech
[30:47.740 --> 30:53.740]  An idiot proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder

[31:29.740 --> 31:37.740]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves
[31:37.740 --> 31:39.740]  The general public doesn't
[31:39.740 --> 31:43.740]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500
[31:43.740 --> 31:53.740]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job

[32:21.740 --> 32:27.740]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors
[32:27.740 --> 32:29.740]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that
[32:29.740 --> 32:33.740]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal
[32:33.740 --> 32:38.740]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[32:38.740 --> 32:43.740]  From the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body
[32:43.740 --> 32:46.740]  This is the engine of the life essence
[32:46.740 --> 32:53.740]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were
[32:53.740 --> 32:59.740]  And this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today
[32:59.740 --> 33:17.740]  Waging War on Corruption
[33:17.740 --> 33:23.740]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[33:23.740 --> 33:33.740]  Ted Malick who is Donald Trump's nominee to be the US ambassador of the European Union
[33:33.740 --> 33:37.740]  Definitely has the pedigree in the background for the job
[33:37.740 --> 33:45.740]  But it's all over the news that they may veto it at the EU which they have the power to do and not accept Trump's ambassador
[33:45.740 --> 33:51.740]  Well he's going to be joining us coming up in the second hour with Dr. Jerome Corsi
[33:51.740 --> 33:58.740]  To give you the inside scoop on what's happening with the president's comp nominee and one of the most important ambassadorships
[33:58.740 --> 34:02.740]  It's probably the most important after the UN ambassadorship
[34:02.740 --> 34:07.740]  So that is coming up I'd say thirdly probably China
[34:07.740 --> 34:10.740]  Fourth would be Russia
[34:10.740 --> 34:14.740]  And then it goes down the list from there
[34:14.740 --> 34:19.740]  Very important the Mexican ambassador I'd say is about the 10th most important US ambassador to Mexico
[34:19.740 --> 34:28.740]  Now these are all very important and the EU is saying they want to block it even though he has posted some of the biggest globalist comfabs there are
[34:28.740 --> 34:33.740]  People say oh well that's terrible but he's been a nationalist all along and he's given all the intel to Trump
[34:33.740 --> 34:37.740]  That's how Trump knows how to dynamite their operations
[34:37.740 --> 34:42.740]  That's why the globalists don't want them, that's why the globalists are fighting with everything they've got
[34:42.740 --> 34:49.740]  Okay, let's start getting into all this
[34:49.740 --> 34:53.740]  We also have James O'Keefe with Big Breaking News and the Veritas Project
[34:53.740 --> 34:56.740]  Project Veritas joining us
[34:56.740 --> 35:00.740]  This Michael Moore thing if you just tuned in I know every second a lot of folks are tuning in
[35:00.740 --> 35:05.740]  We just played a sickening clip from Hardball with Slimeball Chris Matthews
[35:05.740 --> 35:11.740]  And Moore is turning reality upside down
[35:11.740 --> 35:17.740]  It's the Democrats that ran around saying that the human raid was a failure when it wasn't
[35:17.740 --> 35:21.740]  It's the Democrats running around saying Trump's doing this politically
[35:21.740 --> 35:28.740]  Going after hundreds of al-Qaeda ISIS slash al-Nuzra sites all over the Middle East and Africa
[35:28.740 --> 35:31.740]  And some in the south of the United States but nobody knows about that obviously
[35:31.740 --> 35:34.740]  Oops, I guess somebody does, believe me the terrorists already do
[35:34.740 --> 35:39.740]  So I can tell you guys most of these operations are already over
[35:39.740 --> 35:48.740]  These are all targets that the Pentagon, the CIA, the Patriots inside had targeted and knew were real groups
[35:48.740 --> 35:50.740]  And Obama let a lot of these groups into the country
[35:50.740 --> 35:53.740]  To do Lord knows what, I guess sleeper cells
[35:53.740 --> 35:58.740]  We know he and his cousin and people are literally behind the Muslim Brotherhood, the overthrow of Egypt
[35:58.740 --> 36:02.740]  And our government's seeing in back that, I mean, and they blew up hundreds of churches
[36:02.740 --> 36:07.740]  Hundreds, crucified Christians upside down at the Capitol Building
[36:07.740 --> 36:10.740]  That's the kind of people Obama runs with
[36:10.740 --> 36:15.740]  So this got so crazy that even our corrupt government, believe me, it's corrupt
[36:15.740 --> 36:19.740]  Said this is way too far, you really are going to have a fifth column of Muslims
[36:19.740 --> 36:23.740]  Linking up with the Commies and Socialists to have a war?
[36:23.740 --> 36:28.740]  A lot of people were really just mercenaries inside the system
[36:28.740 --> 36:30.740]  They said the Patriots are going to fight that and we're going to lose
[36:30.740 --> 36:31.740]  So we're not going to do it
[36:31.740 --> 36:37.740]  Oh yeah, a lot of these decisions were not made out of moral stuff at the very highest levels
[36:37.740 --> 36:43.740]  It was done because they could read the tea leaves and see how crazy Nancy Pelosi and all these people are
[36:43.740 --> 36:49.740]  That really thought they'd bring in some young strapping Muslims to kick Europe in the US's ass
[36:49.740 --> 36:55.740]  I mean, once you really start suicide bombings every day and mass shootings every day
[36:55.740 --> 37:04.740]  All of you are going to be prosada non grata on this planet
[37:04.740 --> 37:09.740]  Now there were a lot of good patriots in the government and other corporations and groups and all over the world
[37:09.740 --> 37:14.740]  And see this globalist planet now know how evil it is and have gone and read the writings of the globalist
[37:14.740 --> 37:18.740]  We've popularized a lot of those, I could say our audience has helped get that info out
[37:18.740 --> 37:22.740]  I always believed that if we told people what was happening in the world
[37:22.740 --> 37:26.740]  And expose the globalists to their own words and how diabolical it was
[37:26.740 --> 37:30.740]  That people would unify and wake up and start resisting it
[37:30.740 --> 37:34.740]  That's why they always denied it existed even though it was being built in plain view
[37:34.740 --> 37:36.740]  And guess what, common sense prevailed
[37:36.740 --> 37:39.740]  So many people thought I was a fear monger
[37:39.740 --> 37:43.740]  They thought I was saying all this just to be listenable
[37:43.740 --> 37:47.740]  And that people were cowards and would hear this and hide under their beds
[37:47.740 --> 37:51.740]  Some people hid under their beds, but the people that counted didn't
[37:51.740 --> 37:54.740]  And so we've just begun to fight
[37:54.740 --> 37:58.740]  Now the enemy's out in the open saying world government's good and we should all just accept it
[37:58.740 --> 38:02.740]  So what if it's unelected? See how far we've come? Everybody knows the fellow reserves private
[38:02.740 --> 38:07.740]  Trump's taking control of it, ordering them to loan money to small businesses and individuals
[38:07.740 --> 38:13.740]  Ordering them to loan massive money to cities and counties and folks that follow initiatives to hire American
[38:13.740 --> 38:18.740]  You're about to see the power of the big fat state turned loose to actually empower people
[38:18.740 --> 38:24.740]  That's why they are particularly angry because everything they built to screw us over is being taken away
[38:24.740 --> 38:30.740]  To re-empower us and then be dismantled and handed back to the states and the people
[38:30.740 --> 38:37.740]  It's so good, it's so beautiful, it's so pure, it's so winner
[38:37.740 --> 38:41.740]  We're going to win, win, win, you're going to have so much winning
[38:41.740 --> 38:43.740]  You're going to say please stop the winning, it's too much
[38:43.740 --> 38:48.740]  I'm going to say no, because the truth is winning like this is going to be a great responsibility
[38:48.740 --> 38:54.740]  And to not use the incredible power the United States is about to have again times a hundred
[38:54.740 --> 38:59.740]  And not let that be turned towards evil, but turned towards truly promoting human dignity
[38:59.740 --> 39:05.740]  And freedom on the next level for our species and all the advances that Trump started to talk about again
[39:05.740 --> 39:10.740]  In science and technology and medicine that are right around the corner and you look in his eyes
[39:10.740 --> 39:14.740]  They already got him, they just don't know how to deploy him yet
[39:18.740 --> 39:22.740]  Trump's sitting there in the wine house going, they've got all these cancer cures and all this
[39:22.740 --> 39:27.740]  And they instead are running a eugenics program with fluoride and water and the vaccines
[39:27.740 --> 39:34.740]  With the additives to brain damage people, what the hell have people been thinking?
[39:34.740 --> 39:37.740]  Notice Trump's even more hardcore and more focused now
[39:37.740 --> 39:42.740]  Because everything he'd read about and heard about and been told about in behind the scenes channels
[39:42.740 --> 39:49.740]  He now knows it's all true and worse than he thought and he's like, good God, we got to shut this cancer down
[39:49.740 --> 39:51.740]  And the cancer is freaking out
[39:51.740 --> 39:56.740]  So Michael Moore in the clip I just played is saying, oh at dinner
[39:56.740 --> 40:03.740]  And they just make up news reports where there's spies and people listening, oh he had well done steak and ketchup, not even true
[40:03.740 --> 40:08.740]  Or oh, he was looking at classified stuff with the Japanese Prime Minister minutes after the missile launch
[40:08.740 --> 40:12.740]  They were looking at news reports and they went behind closed doors for a classified meeting
[40:12.740 --> 40:20.740]  Everything's a lie, oh he's at dinner with his son-in-law and Bannon and they decide to go after these al-Qaeda and ISIS targets
[40:20.740 --> 40:26.740]  He called you in the campaign he was, he was advised by the former head of Defense Intelligence
[40:26.740 --> 40:29.740]  That knew about all the targets and all the planning between all the agencies
[40:29.740 --> 40:33.740]  That was Flynn's job was to have a bird's-eye view of the whole deal
[40:33.740 --> 40:38.740]  Just like Director of National Intelligence
[40:38.740 --> 40:44.740]  But they just say, oh Trump, you know, just decided at dinner, just randomly to go attack Yemen
[40:44.740 --> 40:46.740]  And then some people got killed
[40:46.740 --> 40:51.740]  Imagine that, they signed up for these dangerous missions, they signed up to be commandos
[40:51.740 --> 40:53.740]  And some people get killed
[40:53.740 --> 40:57.740]  Boy, I don't think they knew that's what they signed up for
[40:57.740 --> 41:02.740]  Because they know they're talking to their coward audience of MSNBC and CNBC
[41:02.740 --> 41:08.740]  They're talking to that coward audience who's like, yeah, they signed up to be on the welfare roles in the Navy SEALs
[41:08.740 --> 41:14.740]  They signed up for Delta Force and Army Rangers and the Green Berets and Marine Force recon
[41:14.740 --> 41:18.740]  So people would wipe their noses for them
[41:18.740 --> 41:24.740]  Then they try to steal the glory
[41:24.740 --> 41:28.740]  Of the fallen soldier, of the sailor
[41:28.740 --> 41:32.740]  And then turn it around that Trump's opportunistic and Trump doesn't care
[41:32.740 --> 41:36.740]  And Trump's bad at how dare them have this widow here
[41:36.740 --> 41:37.740]  Sickening
[41:37.740 --> 41:40.740]  And then of course he says, hey, you just broke a record
[41:40.740 --> 41:42.740]  They're trying to say ratings, no
[41:42.740 --> 41:45.740]  He meant for the longest standing ovation
[41:45.740 --> 41:47.740]  He was trying to make her feel good
[41:47.740 --> 41:49.740]  And it was so genuine
[41:49.740 --> 41:53.740]  It was so real and they hate that charisma
[41:53.740 --> 41:57.740]  So I mean, I've got so much important news to cover
[41:57.740 --> 41:59.740]  But if you understand this, you understand everything
[41:59.740 --> 42:02.740]  Let's go ahead and play the end of that clip we didn't get to
[42:02.740 --> 42:04.740]  No, but then why tonight?
[42:04.740 --> 42:05.740]  I know
[42:05.740 --> 42:09.740]  To say, oh, we got all this treasure trove and using the will
[42:09.740 --> 42:11.740]  Let me back that up again, you paused
[42:11.740 --> 42:14.740]  There's so many lies, I probably should have started to stop this throughout the clip
[42:14.740 --> 42:20.740]  They admittedly got a whole bunch of hard drives and computers and the rest of it
[42:20.740 --> 42:23.740]  That's why they didn't just drop a bunch of bombs on it
[42:23.740 --> 42:27.740]  Because they wanted to kill or capture the people and get the intelligence
[42:27.740 --> 42:32.740]  This was the ISIS command base for much of the Middle East
[42:32.740 --> 42:34.740]  And their headquarters
[42:34.740 --> 42:35.740]  You understand?
[42:35.740 --> 42:38.740]  They wanted to get into the headquarters and get the data
[42:38.740 --> 42:42.740]  Or they could have just dropped a bunch of 2,000 pound bombs on it
[42:42.740 --> 42:46.740]  Or flown around with C-130s with, you know, howitzers hanging off the side
[42:46.740 --> 42:49.740]  And blown the place in the molten slag
[42:49.740 --> 42:51.740]  They wanted the intelligence
[42:51.740 --> 42:53.740]  That's the point of going on the mission
[42:53.740 --> 42:54.740]  And guess what?
[42:54.740 --> 42:58.740]  They were waiting for them because there were leakers inside
[42:58.740 --> 43:03.740]  You know, the type of folks that tell the president, watch your mouth
[43:03.740 --> 43:07.740]  That's how we've got this thing backwards
[43:07.740 --> 43:08.740]  They have a word for it
[43:08.740 --> 43:12.740]  But backwards, that's a family way of saying it
[43:12.740 --> 43:15.740]  That's the arrogance of all these people
[43:15.740 --> 43:19.740]  McCullen and all of them and Brennan
[43:19.740 --> 43:24.740]  What a disgusting group of snot-nosed, cowardly, chicken-neck filth
[43:24.740 --> 43:26.740]  Brennan was a communist in college
[43:26.740 --> 43:28.740]  I mean, give me a break
[43:35.740 --> 43:38.740]  All right, ladies and gentlemen
[43:38.740 --> 43:41.740]  Let me now finish up with the club, here it is
[43:41.740 --> 43:42.740]  Mission or not?
[43:42.740 --> 43:45.740]  Yeah, of course, and that's why she's there
[43:45.740 --> 43:49.740]  As a sort of a few to the people who are criticizing him for this
[43:49.740 --> 43:52.740]  And this poor woman, this widow who has lost her husband
[43:52.740 --> 43:55.740]  She is in desperate grief right now
[43:55.740 --> 43:56.740]  He's in love with her husband still
[43:56.740 --> 43:57.740]  And in love with her husband
[43:57.740 --> 43:58.740]  And what did you think of that?
[43:58.740 --> 44:00.740]  And to use that as just put another notch on his belt
[44:00.740 --> 44:01.740]  And what's he thinking about?
[44:01.740 --> 44:02.740]  My ratings
[44:02.740 --> 44:03.740]  And how many?
[44:03.740 --> 44:04.740]  Here it is, record applause
[44:04.740 --> 44:07.740]  Record grief, I'm going to get an Emmy for this
[44:07.740 --> 44:12.740]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch
[44:12.740 --> 44:18.740]  No, it's an award better than a silver star
[44:18.740 --> 44:19.740]  Or a congressional medal of honor
[44:19.740 --> 44:23.740]  It's being honored by the people and her sacrifice
[44:23.740 --> 44:25.740]  And his sacrifice, because she's got to live now
[44:25.740 --> 44:29.740]  Probably 50 years without the man she's so in love with
[44:33.740 --> 44:34.740]  Let me tell you, those are particular loves
[44:34.740 --> 44:36.740]  That really only get stronger with time
[44:36.740 --> 44:38.740]  A 20-something, 30-something year old woman
[44:38.740 --> 44:42.740]  You know, three kids and then her husband gets killed
[44:42.740 --> 44:44.740]  That's going to comfort her for the rest of her life
[44:44.740 --> 44:47.740]  She's comforting her, that's not allowed
[44:47.740 --> 44:54.740]  That's evil, that's how sick Michael Moore truly is
[44:58.740 --> 44:59.740]  In fact, look at this
[44:59.740 --> 45:02.740]  I have the photo right here for TV viewers
[45:02.740 --> 45:07.740]  Better Democrats remain seated, sullen during tribute to slain seal
[45:07.740 --> 45:09.740]  In fact, we have the video also
[45:09.740 --> 45:12.740]  We're going to play coming up of Nancy Pelosi
[45:12.740 --> 45:14.740]  We have that on the video list
[45:14.740 --> 45:18.740]  Staying seated
[45:18.740 --> 45:21.740]  Yeah, she doesn't clap whenever they're talking about the economy
[45:21.740 --> 45:24.740]  As well as how he's going to try to get jobs
[45:24.740 --> 45:29.740]  And she sits there looking absolutely, completely sullen
[45:29.740 --> 45:32.740]  And disgusting and just angry the whole time
[45:32.740 --> 45:34.740]  The video is on infowars.com
[45:34.740 --> 45:36.740]  I'm going to talk about a particular clip
[45:36.740 --> 45:38.740]  Just the whole time she's sitting there looking like she's dying
[45:38.740 --> 45:40.740]  I was here last night, we were here last night, we covered it live
[45:40.740 --> 45:43.740]  The archive of that is up on our YouTube channel
[45:43.740 --> 45:46.740]  And prisonplanet.tv
[45:46.740 --> 45:52.740]  Better Democrats remain seated during tribute to slain seal
[45:52.740 --> 45:53.740]  Yeah, there she is
[45:53.740 --> 45:57.740]  She looks like a female skeletor
[45:57.740 --> 45:58.740]  Disconnected from reality
[45:58.740 --> 46:01.740]  Made hundreds of millions of dollars or husband billions
[46:01.740 --> 46:02.740]  Since she got into Congress
[46:02.740 --> 46:04.740]  She had nothing when she got there
[46:04.740 --> 46:09.740]  And she is just completely and totally absolutely entitled
[46:09.740 --> 46:12.740]  Now, particularly look at this photo for TV viewers
[46:12.740 --> 46:16.740]  You've got the Democrats seated here
[46:16.740 --> 46:19.740]  During the tribute to the fallen navy seal
[46:19.740 --> 46:22.740]  You've got one guy that's smart enough to stand up, whoever that is
[46:22.740 --> 46:24.740]  And one other guy back here
[46:24.740 --> 46:27.740]  But 90% of them, we've got a Democrat here, here, here
[46:27.740 --> 46:33.740]  You see, one, two, three, four, five, six
[46:33.740 --> 46:36.740]  So we've got six Democrats standing up
[46:36.740 --> 46:40.740]  Out of hundreds, disgusting, arrogant, crazy people
[46:40.740 --> 46:44.740]  No one would ever do that in the past
[46:44.740 --> 46:47.740]  When Obama was giving tributes to the military
[46:47.740 --> 46:50.740]  No one ever did things like that
[46:50.740 --> 46:54.740]  Again, that's how disconnected they are
[46:54.740 --> 46:58.740]  Hillary campaigner calls military widow
[46:58.740 --> 47:02.740]  Honored during Trump's speech an idiot
[47:02.740 --> 47:06.740]  Sorry, Owen's wife, you're not helping yourself
[47:06.740 --> 47:09.740]  Or your husband's memory by standing there
[47:09.740 --> 47:11.740]  And clapping like an idiot
[47:11.740 --> 47:17.740]  Trump just used you
[47:17.740 --> 47:21.740]  These people are totally and completely disconnected
[47:21.740 --> 47:23.740]  Here's an old one, Democrats boo Trump
[47:23.740 --> 47:26.740]  Proposal to give a voice to victims of immigrant crime
[47:26.740 --> 47:29.740]  We're going to get to that coming up after the break
[47:29.740 --> 47:33.740]  Again, video, Pelosi refuses to applaud American job creation
[47:33.740 --> 47:38.740]  We're going to play that when we come back
[47:38.740 --> 47:41.740]  Now look at this one, I'm going to play this as well when we come back first
[47:41.740 --> 47:46.740]  Democrats think Trump's job is to represent the world, not America
[47:46.740 --> 47:49.740]  They refuse to stand, they refuse to clap, but worse
[47:49.740 --> 47:52.740]  They went and complained particularly about this
[47:52.740 --> 47:56.740]  To C-SPAN and other TV channels and networks right after it
[47:56.740 --> 47:58.740]  We played clips at the start of the broadcast
[47:58.740 --> 48:00.740]  I mean, it's like a dirty word now
[48:00.740 --> 48:02.740]  We should say they plan to get rid of our sovereignty
[48:02.740 --> 48:04.740]  And transfer power to multinational groups
[48:04.740 --> 48:06.740]  That's a conspiracy, that'll never happen
[48:06.740 --> 48:09.740]  Here's all their admissions, now they're doing it
[48:09.740 --> 48:11.740]  And Trump wants to reverse it
[48:11.740 --> 48:15.740]  Like gee, our legs cut off, we better tie a tourniquet around it
[48:15.740 --> 48:18.740]  That's insane, let the blood flow out on the ground
[48:18.740 --> 48:21.740]  That's how you become happy
[48:21.740 --> 48:24.740]  Here, let's stick our hands in this meat grinder
[48:24.740 --> 48:26.740]  Here, let's climb in the wood chipper and turn it on
[48:26.740 --> 48:29.740]  That sounds like Trump's like, let's not climb in the wood chipper
[48:29.740 --> 48:31.740]  They're like, yes, we must destroy the country's sovereignty
[48:31.740 --> 48:36.740]  And transfer all power to secret offshore groups or we're evil
[48:36.740 --> 48:39.740]  Can you believe Trump? He said we ought to have a country
[48:39.740 --> 48:41.740]  I mean, oh my gosh, oh my gosh
[48:41.740 --> 48:44.740]  If someone's a felon, like a rapist, he's going to deport them
[48:44.740 --> 48:47.740]  He's going to make you come here legal like everybody else does
[48:47.740 --> 48:50.740]  I mean, it's crazy, he doesn't want you to come here
[48:50.740 --> 48:52.740]  And have your baby free at the hospital either
[48:52.740 --> 48:55.740]  I mean, wow, man, what will he do next?
[48:55.740 --> 48:57.740]  I don't know, he's really bad
[49:01.740 --> 49:03.740]  So that's all coming up after the break
[49:03.740 --> 49:05.740]  First off, we are ending the special today
[49:05.740 --> 49:07.740]  And it is gone
[49:07.740 --> 49:10.740]  Massive specials across the board at InfowarsTour.com
[49:10.740 --> 49:12.740]  And InfowarsLife.com
[49:12.740 --> 49:14.740]  The Make America Great Again specials
[49:14.740 --> 49:17.740]  We've been running for a week and a half, helped fund us after Google
[49:17.740 --> 49:21.740]  Through AdRoll banned us from advertising on the internet, basically
[49:21.740 --> 49:23.740]  On any Google platform
[49:23.740 --> 49:26.740]  And you've really come through and we've made back a lot of the losses
[49:26.740 --> 49:30.740]  To help fund this operation and the DC offices that I have the lease
[49:30.740 --> 49:33.740]  Right here in my hand to sign that I've been holding off on
[49:33.740 --> 49:35.740]  To make sure we even get the money for that bureau
[49:35.740 --> 49:37.740]  But it looks like we've got it, so thank you
[49:37.740 --> 49:39.740]  Take advantage of these great sales
[49:39.740 --> 49:42.740]  We had massive sales last night of X2 because Millie Weaver talked about
[49:42.740 --> 49:44.740]  How much it helped her, Leigh Ann talked about it
[49:44.740 --> 49:46.740]  Other people did, Owen Schreuer
[49:46.740 --> 49:48.740]  I said, what product do you like the best? And they all gave their own testimonials
[49:48.740 --> 49:51.740]  I'd never heard, but similar to what other people say
[49:51.740 --> 49:55.740]  In fact, I know I asked Anthony to print me off some of the testimonials every day
[49:55.740 --> 49:57.740]  And then I never read them, but I'm going to give them to print me off
[49:57.740 --> 49:59.740]  Some later so I can read them to you
[49:59.740 --> 50:01.740]  Go read the five-star reviews at InfowarsTour.com
[50:01.740 --> 50:04.740]  We link through to third-party sites, we can read them by the thousands
[50:04.740 --> 50:07.740]  X2 is 25% off the good halogen
[50:07.740 --> 50:09.740]  Nobody else has this pure iodine
[50:09.740 --> 50:11.740]  25% off brain force
[50:11.740 --> 50:13.740]  J.J. Trump and Ronald Reagan lithographs
[50:13.740 --> 50:15.740]  Again, these are original prints
[50:15.740 --> 50:17.740]  New ink colors, new design
[50:17.740 --> 50:19.740]  On different parchment paper, but when these are gone
[50:19.740 --> 50:22.740]  That's it for this design
[50:22.740 --> 50:24.740]  Into Eternity
[50:24.740 --> 50:26.740]  1995, parchment in the roll
[50:26.740 --> 50:28.740]  Delivered to your door
[50:28.740 --> 50:30.740]  In the tube, makes a great gift as well
[50:30.740 --> 50:31.740]  Great for framing
[50:31.740 --> 50:32.740]  Trump Pence 2020
[50:32.740 --> 50:34.740]  Battlecry T-shirt
[50:34.740 --> 50:37.740]  $9.95, we're selling these close to cost
[50:37.740 --> 50:39.740]  It says
[50:39.740 --> 50:41.740]  Pence 2020
[50:41.740 --> 50:43.740]  Keeping America great
[50:43.740 --> 50:45.740]  Infowars.com on the right shoulder, on the back
[50:45.740 --> 50:47.740]  America first in 1776
[50:47.740 --> 50:49.740]  Infowars.com
[50:49.740 --> 50:51.740]  Great way to meet like-minded people
[50:51.740 --> 50:53.740]  Great way to spread the word, great way to stand up
[50:53.740 --> 50:55.740]  For free speech, this is going to be the new hit shirt
[50:55.740 --> 50:57.740]  It already is, a lot of folks are getting it
[50:57.740 --> 51:17.740]  Hi, this is Ron Paul. I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate. The world is in turmoil. Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace. As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events. However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[51:17.740 --> 51:34.740]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good. So we keep some food on hand just in case. My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better. It's a home-freeze dryer from Harvest Right. With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[51:34.740 --> 51:46.740]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat, and it lasts up to 25 years. Who knows what the future will bring? One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.

[52:17.740 --> 52:22.740]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of heart and body extract.
[52:22.740 --> 52:32.740]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[52:32.740 --> 52:47.740]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries. It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic cells. The body is an amazing thing. It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[53:47.740 --> 54:00.740]  In the morning, you go running for the man who stole your heart.
[54:17.740 --> 54:39.740]  Let me go back to this t-shirt for a moment because it really shook up the globalist. It had a huge effect, especially at rallies, both Republican and Democrat, to see a third of the people wearing Infowars.com shirts, Hillary for Prison shirts, you name it.
[54:39.740 --> 54:53.740]  And that's why we sold most of those shirts at either $995 or $5. Now at $5, we lose money because some of the extra, extra larges cost more than that, but I really wanted to flood the country with the shirts.
[54:53.740 --> 55:06.740]  I believe this new shirt will flood the country even more. You've seen the power. You've seen what it did. Trump pints 2020.
[55:06.740 --> 55:15.740]  Trump is over-delivering. He's doing everything he said he would do. He's got the globalist totally scared. World government's in trouble. He's trying to stop the economy imploding.
[55:15.740 --> 55:27.740]  But the reason I'm so behind Trump is, we're neck and neck here, ladies and gentlemen. We're not out of the woods by a long shot. They're desperate. They can try to kill him. They're trying to implode the economy.
[55:27.740 --> 55:42.740]  But Trump loves a fight. He's a total fighter. It's just a fact. I mean, look what he's done. He looked 10 years younger last night. It's just crazy. The guy's 70 years old. The oldest president ever elected. It just gets weirder and cooler by the minute.
[55:42.740 --> 55:58.740]  See, worshiping Kim Jong-un is a joke because the guy's a joke. Thinking Trump's amazing in an example. Just how he gets better with age is the truth. So everybody needs to get the shirt. It's $9.95. That way we'll make like, you know, four bucks to help fund the operation on each shirt.
[55:58.740 --> 56:12.740]  We're selling a lot of these. So we just upped the order to make even more. If you pre-order it, it'll be in next week and shipped out to you. Be an apprentice right here in America, then we will, again, get it out to you at $9.95.
[56:12.740 --> 56:18.740]  After that, when it's officially here and shipping, it's going to go back to $19.95 because we need to fund the operation, obviously.
[56:18.740 --> 56:28.740]  But that special is at infowarsstore.com or AAA-2533139. But they're trying to bully free speech. They're trying to shut it down. They're trying to attack Trump supporters.
[56:28.740 --> 56:38.740]  But they do that at rallies and things or at universities where they know the cops have been ordered to stand down. In public, in most areas, it just shows solidarity and lets other people know it's safe to speak out.
[56:38.740 --> 56:46.740]  And that's something else Trump's done, battling political correctness, saying things everybody knows is true. It makes it safe and okay for other people to say it.
[56:46.740 --> 56:54.740]  Because everything they do is to try to make normal things we cover and normal things we talk about sound dirty and evil.
[56:54.740 --> 57:05.740]  But it's not. Like Len Beck last week, he's going back to this because it's an archetypal example. It's a case point of upside down behavior, of inversion.
[57:05.740 --> 57:12.740]  He says it's horrible. He wants nationalism for the economy and actual jobs and thinking about America. First, this is very dangerous.
[57:12.740 --> 57:17.740]  That's like saying he wants oxygen for his children. He doesn't want them to suffocate.
[57:17.740 --> 57:26.740]  But they say it with a straight face like, don't say mother and father when you're at a public event or at the school. Someone may not have a mother or father. You having one is bad.
[57:26.740 --> 57:34.740]  Say, gee, or he or they, use the words. We're not a cult. Just don't say mother or father. We're not a cult. Here, take this vaccine. We want to make you take it.
[57:34.740 --> 57:43.740]  Here, let's have grown men in your girl's showers. It's normal. If they don't want to see a man's penis, then there's something wrong with them. That's Cuomo on CNN.
[57:43.740 --> 57:59.740]  They're cult members, folks. They know what they're doing. They're using peer pressure on you and Trump's smashing all that. Let's go out to break with this clip where, again, they're critical of the fact that Trump is talking about America first. Here it is.
[57:59.740 --> 58:15.740]  We expect our partners, whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations and pay their fair share of the cost, have to do that.
[58:15.740 --> 58:33.740]  We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.
[58:33.740 --> 58:49.740]  All over the media, I've got the articles. They said it's horrible. Free nations. We'll be back. Stay with us for the second hour straight ahead.
[59:03.740 --> 59:10.740]  I'm not really out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[59:10.740 --> 59:18.740]  The Prostaguard formula does just that with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[59:18.740 --> 59:28.740]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, and copper.
[59:28.740 --> 59:38.740]  Prostaguard is something that the men on the InfoWars crew take every day, and from our research, it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.

[1:00:02.740 --> 1:00:12.740]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:39.740]  Let's back up that clip I was just playing of the President last night in his first address to Congress, and then I've got a stack of news articles.
[1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:54.740]  We played video clips the last hour where they have Democrats going on TV saying they couldn't stand the fact that he was talking about America and having our own sovereignty and having our own borders and doing trade deals that are more equitable.
[1:00:54.740 --> 1:01:05.740]  I mean, that is unthinkable. America is here to be sold off by the parasite class, Nancy Pelosi, who again thinks George W. Bush is still the President.
[1:01:05.740 --> 1:01:14.740]  That's how entitled these people are. Well, it's just not going to continue on forever. Let's go back to that full clip.
[1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:27.740]  Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.
[1:01:27.740 --> 1:01:36.740]  My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.
[1:01:36.740 --> 1:01:46.740]  This is so simple, but so true and so fundamental and so powerful that they all over the news, New York Times today, you name it, say this is bad.
[1:01:46.740 --> 1:02:09.740]  That's how dumb they think you are. That's how upside down they think we are. That he's saying the best way for people to express themselves and be free is through free nations, free, open, elected nations that have culture and have systems that bind them together.
[1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:22.740]  That's the best way to express human freedom. Instead of some foreign secret TPP, UN World Government, where they admit they want to make us poor, dumb us down and have a global government with forced inoculations and forced medical tyranny.
[1:02:22.740 --> 1:02:31.740]  That's all been announced by the Clintons and by Bill and Linda Gates and all their foundations ripping people off and robbing Haiti and all the rest of it.
[1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:41.740]  And here comes Trump just saying total common sense, like drive on the right hand side of the road, put one foot in front of the other, wash your hands before you eat.
[1:02:41.740 --> 1:02:50.740]  I mean, he's just saying total common sense and they're going, this is horrible because what they're doing so horrible, they have to again invert reality.
[1:02:50.740 --> 1:02:57.740]  Well, guess what? We're not living in upside down land anymore. Okay, let's go back to the president.
[1:02:57.740 --> 1:03:01.740]  I want to play it again. I want to play the entire clip because it's so powerful.
[1:03:01.740 --> 1:03:17.740]  We expect our partners, whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations and pay their fair share of the cost, have to do that.
[1:03:17.740 --> 1:03:38.740]  We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.
[1:03:38.740 --> 1:03:48.740]  The three nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.
[1:03:48.740 --> 1:04:13.740]  My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.
[1:04:13.740 --> 1:04:19.740]  All right, we're going to come back with Trump's nominee for the ambassador ship for the European Union.
[1:04:19.740 --> 1:04:29.740]  That is probably the second most important ambassador ship. Some could argue with the big crack up of the EU taking place, the most important ambassador ship.
[1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:37.740]  And he's definitely got the credentials in the background to do it, but an unprecedented move, they don't want him. They're saying they may veto it.
[1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:47.740]  That's like kicking somebody's ambassador out before we have a war with them. Because right now the EU is totally run by Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, and they are looting it seven ways from Sunday.
[1:04:47.740 --> 1:04:54.740]  The vampires are having their will right now. The last thing they want is some whipper snapper in there that might want to have those people be free.
[1:04:54.740 --> 1:05:01.740]  We'll be back as the global revolution against tyranny accelerates.
[1:05:01.740 --> 1:05:15.740]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower, last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country.
[1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:25.740]  Right after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects like Michael Moore appeared on television to bash Donald Trump.
[1:05:25.740 --> 1:05:29.740]  This time for honoring, wait for it, veterans.
[1:05:29.740 --> 1:05:37.740]  If you want to get an Emmy for this, most applause for a dead soldier on my watch. I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[1:05:37.740 --> 1:05:53.740]  Meanwhile, other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted vulgar remarks on Twitter, calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.

[1:08:20.740 --> 1:08:36.740]  There must be some kind of way out of here. Say the joke to the thief. There's too much confusion. I can't get no relief.
[1:08:36.740 --> 1:08:55.740]  All right, welcome back. We're now into the second hour. Coming up, we're going to play more of the historic address of Congress last night with President Trump.
[1:08:55.740 --> 1:09:02.740]  The mainstream media has just totally freaked out that he said that we will actually have America first and will negotiate deals that are best for the country.
[1:09:02.740 --> 1:09:08.740]  They just say, this is horrible. We're going to play clips of that. This is becoming really bizarre.
[1:09:08.740 --> 1:09:21.740]  But again, they're trying to make just normal business, normal common sense seem weird because handing all our sovereignty over to multinational, unelected institutions is what's actually crazy.
[1:09:21.740 --> 1:09:31.740]  Now, to the bottom of the hour, I can't go over his whole bio, it would take 30 minutes. Ted Malik of tedmalik.com joins us. I can't go over his whole pedigree of major institutions.
[1:09:31.740 --> 1:09:36.740]  He's Ron, where he's a professor, all the things that he's been involved in.
[1:09:36.740 --> 1:09:48.740]  He's also been a high-ranking official in the UN Economic Commission for Europe and president of the CNN World Economic Development Congress, Davos, the whole nine yards.
[1:09:48.740 --> 1:09:54.740]  And I appreciate him coming on. And here are the headlines out of the Washington Post, Breitbart, New York Post.
[1:09:54.740 --> 1:09:59.740]  Why Europe fears this great U.S. ambassador is the headline.
[1:09:59.740 --> 1:10:06.740]  So they're battling. Here's another headline. European Parliament battles nomination of Ted Malik as U.S. ambassador.
[1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:11.740]  So they're saying don't nominate him, Trump, even though that's who they said they want to nominate.
[1:10:11.740 --> 1:10:21.740]  Because if you do that, we're going to veto it, which again is unprecedented. And of course, I've seen Ted Malik all over TV for years.
[1:10:21.740 --> 1:10:26.740]  I mean, he comes off as very diplomatic. I mean, sounds like a perfect choice.
[1:10:26.740 --> 1:10:32.740]  If you went over his whole bio here, he's already been accepted into all these groups. They know who he is.
[1:10:32.740 --> 1:10:42.740]  It says SWAV and distinguished. He's a professor, respected British business school, former Oxford visiting fellow Yale professor.
[1:10:42.740 --> 1:10:46.740]  He's written 14 books as high-ranking official at the UN Economic Commission and just goes on and on. I can't read the whole bio.
[1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:51.740]  So why does Trump wanting? Why are they trying to block it? I think talking to the man himself, we can find out.
[1:10:51.740 --> 1:10:56.740]  His longtime friend, Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's also joining us via Skype, can pop in.
[1:10:56.740 --> 1:11:00.740]  So Ted, thanks for coming on. What's going on here?
[1:11:00.740 --> 1:11:11.740]  Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be on your show. I last saw you at the inauguration when we were celebrating President Trump's arrival in the Washington scene.
[1:11:11.740 --> 1:11:20.740]  And last night, of course, as you've just shown in your clip, he said he's going to be president of the United States and not president of the world.
[1:11:20.740 --> 1:11:31.740]  The reason that I've, I think, raised such a controversy in Europe is certainly not because of my educational pedigree or my dialogical skills.
[1:11:31.740 --> 1:11:45.740]  It's because I represent the worldview and the thinking of Donald Trump in Europe, and they actually hate and detest everything he is, stands for, and has said,
[1:11:45.740 --> 1:11:55.740]  because he's turning the whole world over and he's changing their globalist outlook and forcing the world back into a state-centric system.
[1:11:55.740 --> 1:12:09.740]  Now, no, I know that that's something you've talked about and promoted quite a lot. I mean, let's get into your particular view of where the world currently is and where this battle to get you into that position is going.
[1:12:09.740 --> 1:12:21.740]  Well, I have not yet been nominated by the president. I have interviewed with the transition team, and I was told I was favorably disposed to be put forward in such a position.
[1:12:21.740 --> 1:12:38.740]  Certainly, it's leaked. I've been on television talking about the EU and about Trump. You know, I was involved in the campaign. I wrote a book about Trump's path to victory, so I've been all over both the British press and the European press.
[1:12:38.740 --> 1:12:48.740]  And that's frankly because very few people in Europe expected Trump to win had any knowledge of what he was thinking, what kinds of policies he might enact.
[1:12:48.740 --> 1:12:58.740]  They frankly didn't have anybody else to turn to, so there are only a handful of us, frankly, in Europe that have any sensibility about what Trump represents.
[1:12:58.740 --> 1:13:04.740]  So I have had, I would say, even overexposure in the last eight weeks.
[1:13:04.740 --> 1:13:11.740]  Absolutely. I've seen you all over TV and I don't even watch that much mainstream television. Well, looking at this, when you look at the New York Post, it's obviously pretty close to Trump.
[1:13:11.740 --> 1:13:19.740]  They act like you are the nominee. I understand you're not officially, but the way that EU sees it is they're like, hey, you're nominating him, you better not do it, we'll veto that.
[1:13:19.740 --> 1:13:30.740]  Can you explain how they have the quote power to do that? I mean, if you become who Trump wants to represent us and then that happens, then why wouldn't that be something that they would accept?
[1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:44.740]  Well, what the European Union and frankly other countries around the world want is not so much a US ambassador to them who represents the US point of view, or in this case, the view of the Trump administration.
[1:13:44.740 --> 1:13:54.740]  What they really want is someone who will represent their view back to the United States. In other words, one that becomes captive or nativist and that takes their point of view.
[1:13:54.740 --> 1:14:16.740]  What they fear is that the Trump position and his view, which has been fairly clear in terms of Brexit and in terms of multilateralism and certainly supra national organizations, is not something that would be welcome in Brussels where the European Union is headquartered
[1:14:16.740 --> 1:14:26.740]  because they fear that the Union itself is coming apart with the vote of the United Kingdom to leave that European Union.
[1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:40.740]  And with a number of elections coming up in any number of other European countries and potentially referenda on whether the country should either stay in the Eurozone and keep the Euro as their currency or even leave the European Union,
[1:14:40.740 --> 1:14:49.740]  they fear that their Union is frankly in a position of if not collapse of derailment.
[1:14:49.740 --> 1:15:01.740]  That's right. Even the French news agency yesterday called it a soft civil war. You've got Poland trying to pull out. Le Pen basically says she'll pull out of the EU or discipline it and actually make it serve national interest.
[1:15:01.740 --> 1:15:11.740]  You've got Gert Wilders in the lead in the Netherlands. You've got Italy, as you know, a month or so ago saying we're not going to vote to have EU expansion. We're not going to accept an EU army marching in.
[1:15:11.740 --> 1:15:20.740]  The arrogance of the EU, this unelected body saying, oh, you want to pull out countries? We're just going to dissolve your militaries and put them under our control.
[1:15:20.740 --> 1:15:38.740]  I mean, the arrogant open conquest of this, and I know you're a leading expert on this. How would you break down, because you are a historian on the subjects, the place we are in the world where suddenly nationalism and self-determination is an avant-garde.
[1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:53.740]  It's exploding like wildfire, and it's having success. And now with Trump mega success, you see obviously what happened with Brexit, and then the system just becomes more arrogant and tells us we should live austerely while they live like kings.
[1:15:53.740 --> 1:15:59.740]  I mean, it's like Marie Antoinette. I know she didn't really say this, but, you know, let them eat cake. And then that became Bastille Day.
[1:15:59.740 --> 1:16:10.740]  It just seems almost like, you know, those that the gods would destroy, they would first make mad. So since you've been all over Europe, you know all these people, you're in the middle of it. What's really going on?
[1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:22.740]  Well, I summed it up in an op-ed the other day when I said Davos Man is dead. Now, whether he's literally dead or just dying, I think it's a question of medical terminology.
[1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:40.740]  But this view that the globally elites can run our countries, can run our lives, can run our cultures, most of them unelected, undemocratic, socialist in orientation, progressive in terms of ideology, some of them far to the left,
[1:16:40.740 --> 1:16:52.740]  not just socialist, but even further to the left, is frankly coming to a screeching halt. And that's happening in large part because the pendulum is now swinging in the opposite direction.
[1:16:52.740 --> 1:17:14.740]  The election of Donald Trump has signaled that with a magnet phone. Of course, Brexit before Nigel Farage and the whole movement to leave Europe was not supposed to be victorious. And it has actually now, I think, changed the course of modern European,
[1:17:14.740 --> 1:17:27.740]  maybe even global history, because that pendulum, like the pencil that's flowing off the table, has reached its tipping point. And a number of countries around the world are likely to follow suit.
[1:17:27.740 --> 1:17:42.740]  You know, maybe we can pull that clip up briefly of when Brexit passed in the next day, Nigel Farage, leading the torch in Europe, obviously, and I know you know him as well, says, you know, you laughed at me 15 years ago when I was first in this body, you're not laughing now,
[1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:59.740]  but they still laugh and then Pelosi won't even stand up, you know, for the veterans, the Democrats sat down, they boo and get upset when Trump talks about America first. I mean, the disconnect of these people in the same press conference,
[1:17:59.740 --> 1:18:12.740]  Pelosi thinks Bush is still president eight plus years later. And then Maxine Waters gets up and says, well, Trump's helping Putin in who invaded Korea. She doesn't even say North or South Korea and their mistake. It's just la la land.
[1:18:12.740 --> 1:18:26.740]  I've been around these people. I've talked to some of them. They really are so insulated that I guess I was wrong back when I thought it was more centralized and conspiratorial. It's more like just a bunch of corrupt people got in control.
[1:18:26.740 --> 1:18:37.740]  Special interests just come in and it's almost worse than a conspiracy because it's like we just have no defense mechanism against these inept horrible people that have sold us out for pennies on the dollar.
[1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:55.740]  Well, you're talking about the Democratic Party in the United States and it was quite observable last night when half the room was giving the president a deserved standing ovation for some, I think, very, very sincere words about the American military and about our military
[1:18:55.740 --> 1:19:15.740]  heroes and also about some of the policies he wants to enact. And the other half of the room either sat in their hands or hissed him. So it's a very polarized situation. That situation is actually 10 times worse in Europe where the political spectrum is certainly left of the United States and where
[1:19:15.740 --> 1:19:32.740]  Donald Trump is held in the highest degree of contempt. I think it interests you, Alex. I was on CNN before the election and Becky Anderson's show. I do go on all these shows. I keep getting invited and go back maybe to torture them as much as myself.
[1:19:32.740 --> 1:19:43.740]  But she asked me seriously. The question that she asked me was, don't you think the whole world should get to vote for the United States president?
[1:19:43.740 --> 1:19:49.740]  Wow. I missed that. Well, let's find that clip. What was the name of the clip? You remember on YouTube?
[1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:53.740]  Well, it's Becky Anderson's show, State of the World, or whatever it's called.
[1:19:53.740 --> 1:19:58.740]  Yeah, guys, Google it. State of the world. Everyone in the world is able to vote for president. I'm going to find that. That is incredible.
[1:19:58.740 --> 1:20:15.740]  Glenn Beck. I don't want to sit here and bash Glenn Beck, sir, but Glenn Beck was on CNN last week and he said, quote, it's scary that Trump and Bannon want nationalism and economic nationalism. So again, there it is. What are they doing?
[1:20:15.740 --> 1:20:33.740]  Well, I mean, Glenn Beck, I think has been off his rocker for some time, but Steve Bannon is the genius behind this intellectually. He is the strategist. He talked about his three buckets that he's trying to work out of during CPAC the other day.
[1:20:33.740 --> 1:20:53.740]  I think that was very telltale, very constructive. And certainly Donald Trump has taken that course and he argues very forcefully, frankly, as Theodore Roosevelt did and other people did at the turn of the 20th century for America's national economic health.
[1:20:53.740 --> 1:20:56.740]  We need to rebuild our country.
[1:20:56.740 --> 1:20:58.740]  We're talking about renewal.
[1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:11.740]  We are talking about renewal of the American spirit. And I actually, you know, I am a spiritual person, a Christian. And I noticed that Trump mentioned God at least a half a dozen times. It seemed like they hate that speech.
[1:21:11.740 --> 1:21:25.740]  So the origin even of some of this impetus is clear in his thinking. And I tell you, people on the right, people in evangelical circles, strong Catholics appreciate what the president is saying.
[1:21:25.740 --> 1:21:37.740]  Well, we definitely need to get you in there as the ambassador to the European Union. I said that's probably the second most important. I'm not the most important after the ambassador to the UN, obviously.
[1:21:37.740 --> 1:21:44.740]  And again, they've got you here in the newspapers as if you were already the nominee. So that's that's how that's how they're seeing it. This is the New York Post.
[1:21:44.740 --> 1:21:57.740]  It says why Europe fears this great US ambassador. Ted, the website's Ted Malik.com. What else can we do as I bring Dr. Corsi in here briefly? What else can we do to help ensure?
[1:21:57.740 --> 1:22:11.740]  I know you've also written a lot of books as well to make sure that this new nationalism, but I call 1776 worldwide, the American example worldwide, not physical force, but the American spirit of Renaissance reborn for renewal the whole planet.
[1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:20.740]  This is what we need, not a, you know, UN, global corporate elite dictatorship coming in, you know, dictating the terms of human surrender to the technocracy.
[1:22:20.740 --> 1:22:30.740]  What can we do to have have Trump fully nominate you and then try to somehow finesse you into the position and have the EU accept it?
[1:22:30.740 --> 1:22:44.740]  Well, there are two things. Obviously, in the first hand, we have we have to remind Donald Trump that I've had this conversation and that I'm the best candidate, I think to represent that point of view in Europe because of qualifications.
[1:22:44.740 --> 1:22:57.740]  And frankly, because, you know, I've spent all this time in Europe and understand and can constructively talk with them. I'm not there to be their arch enemy, I just have to bring them our point of view.
[1:22:57.740 --> 1:23:14.740]  And secondly, I think if the European Union wants to make me persona non grad, which is what they say, it would be a badge of honor to make me PNG in Brussels and actually say we won't accept an ambassador from the United States who has Trump's point of view.
[1:23:14.740 --> 1:23:28.740]  I think we should then do two things, send them no ambassador and deal with them only on a bilateral basis. Yes. And secondly, remove their ambassador from Washington DC.
[1:23:28.740 --> 1:23:33.740]  Because if they're not going to accept our ambassador, that's usually what you do right before a war happens.
[1:23:33.740 --> 1:23:44.740]  Right. I mean, it's just unprecedented the arrogance. Well, you look at arrogance in history Hitler, as you know, just a week before he finally got killed or committed suicide.
[1:23:44.740 --> 1:23:52.740]  They're under the chancellery in Berlin, still thought he was going to beat the Russians and the allies was totally delusional and his people still believed him.
[1:23:52.740 --> 1:23:58.740]  Now, I think we're far from that, but we're getting close where nationalism is exploding. It's so popular.
[1:23:58.740 --> 1:24:09.740]  And this globalism is unelected, so disconnected, so corrupt. I mean, they're never going to be able to have this private corporate world government with a whole socialist bent to it.
[1:24:09.740 --> 1:24:21.740]  When there's opposition to it, they're losing ground everywhere. They back the very worst actors like, you know, radical Islam, they're just horrible people who are so disconnected that they don't get it.
[1:24:21.740 --> 1:24:36.740]  So, I mean, I think we need to explain to them, you're going to lose, you need to get with the program and believe in humanity again, instead of having this eugenics view of, you know, cut off the resources and slave the people while they themselves live like kings.
[1:24:36.740 --> 1:24:46.740]  Let's bring in Dr. Jerome Corsi, who I know is a big, you know, a booster of, you know, Trump trying to ram you through, which I think is a good move, you know, play the Trump card on him.
[1:24:46.740 --> 1:24:55.740]  I think this is a great idea, Dr. Corsi. Again, the New York Post and folks, I mean, act like he's already the ambassador. How do we get this through?
[1:24:55.740 --> 1:25:04.740]  Well, I've known Ted for a long time, and he's a big best choice. I was with Ted at Nigel Farage during the inauguration.
[1:25:04.740 --> 1:25:19.740]  Ted has the very strong support of all the Brexit leaders. He will represent accurately and strongly President Trump's position to the EU. This is what frightens the EU, and it is really astounding.
[1:25:19.740 --> 1:25:34.740]  I mean, by the way, Ted is a Theodore Roosevelt president, Roosevelt descendant. He is a PhD. He's very strongly regarded both in academics. He's been on the international stage, but he's not a globalist.
[1:25:34.740 --> 1:25:47.740]  This is a remarkable thing about Ted Malik. He's been at Davos. He's actually run the Aspen Institute. He's run them both, but he's done it always with a perspective of the United States.
[1:25:47.740 --> 1:25:57.740]  And that's why they don't like him, just like Bannon from Goldman Sachs. He's been inside the systems. He knows how to work it. He's been at the highest levels, but he's going to represent us. That's why they're scared.
[1:25:57.740 --> 1:26:03.740]  That's right. He didn't drink their Kool-Aid. He went along with the internationalism.
[1:26:03.740 --> 1:26:09.740]  Just like Rex Tillerson did to be able to stay where he was at, but quietly fighting at the whole time.
[1:26:09.740 --> 1:26:24.740]  Precisely. And this is really what the core of Donald Trump's strength is, and the key reason he was elected. The American people do not want to become part of some godless global system, unelected officials in Brussels telling us what to do.
[1:26:24.740 --> 1:26:38.740]  We want the United States of America. We want the Constitution. We want the freedoms that our founding fathers gave us in a Judeo-Christian nation that was born with principles that have been astounding in terms of their ability to protect liberty.
[1:26:38.740 --> 1:26:47.740]  Sure. And people that are watching on TV all recognize Ted Malik, but I should have said Aspen Institute, one of the most elite international organizations.
[1:26:47.740 --> 1:26:54.740]  People say, well, then why do you want him? Because over the years, he's always fought to keep sovereignty and to promote free market systems.
[1:26:54.740 --> 1:27:06.740]  And now he'll be able to help dynamite these tentacles of control that are bringing us down and turn the whole world free. That's why we need him. And I sure hope that Trump does this.
[1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:12.740]  Well, you're exactly right. See, Alex, he ran Davos for over 10 years.
[1:27:12.740 --> 1:27:19.740]  I forgot that. He ran Davos. And he's saying Davos is dead. I mean, I should have intro'd this. I never hype things like I should.
[1:27:19.740 --> 1:27:31.740]  The man that ran Davos and the Aspen Institute is saying that the new world order that they've set up is dead, and that we need to have nations create a new global alliance to empower humanity.
[1:27:31.740 --> 1:27:35.740]  That is absolutely incredible. No wonder they don't want him in there.
[1:27:35.740 --> 1:27:52.740]  Well, I hope Ted get his memoirs published two years ago, because it's a remarkable story of, you know, someone has been on the globalist stage at the highest level, running it, running Davos, running the Aspen Institute in the United Nations in Geneva.
[1:27:52.740 --> 1:28:01.740]  I mean, Ted has said agree credentials of the new world order, but Ted has constantly said that we need to preserve American sovereignty. He was a supporter of Donald Trump.
[1:28:01.740 --> 1:28:10.740]  Sure. And notice, all you know is, all you know is the globalists are against Trump. The globalists are against Ted Malik, because they understand that they fear the understanding he has.
[1:28:10.740 --> 1:28:23.740]  So I should have intro'd this. Let me do it again now. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got Ted Malik, the man that ran Davos, the public Bilderberg group for 10 years that ran the Aspen Institute, the guy that knows where all the bodies are buried, that has the keys to the kingdom,
[1:28:23.740 --> 1:28:32.740]  to the kingdom, who's quietly been trying to stop the system forever. Donald Trump wants to send him to be the EU ambassador, and they're trying to blow that up right now. This is incredible.
[1:28:32.740 --> 1:28:39.740]  Well, Ted, in closing, how do we make sure, again, the listeners, that you're the man that Trump forces through?
[1:28:39.740 --> 1:28:53.740]  Well, there, there's a little bit of exaggeration, or I have partly in my good friend Jerry's recitation of my biography. I never really ran Davos. I was only on the executive board for, I think, four or five years, but...
[1:28:53.740 --> 1:28:57.740]  Oh, so you were on the executive board of Davos. You're nobody.
[1:28:57.740 --> 1:29:04.740]  I have at least some degree of humility, like Vice President Pence, which I...
[1:29:04.740 --> 1:29:06.740]  Yeah, we need humility, you're right.
[1:29:06.740 --> 1:29:11.740]  But I'm just excited if you get in there and be able to help bring down the EU. Oh, sorry.
[1:29:11.740 --> 1:29:25.740]  Yeah, if people in the United States could support my being involved, whether it's in this role or another role, I think that I could help the Trump effort, particularly on the international front.
[1:29:25.740 --> 1:29:35.740]  Absolutely. Well, Mr. Malik, thank you so much. People can find out more about your books at tedmalik.com. MSM is going to attack him being on the show. That's good. We don't want to be with the system.
[1:29:35.740 --> 1:29:43.740]  We are the folks trying to remove the globalist elite, and we need somebody like Mr. Malik who knows how to burn this thing down and restore the Republic.
[1:29:43.740 --> 1:29:48.740]  All right, we'll be back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Alex Jones. This is The Info War. Thank you, Dr. Corsi, as well.
[1:29:48.740 --> 1:29:56.740]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:56.740 --> 1:30:15.740]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower, last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country.
[1:30:15.740 --> 1:30:29.740]  After President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects, like Michael Moore, appeared on television to bash Donald Trump, this time for honoring, wait for it, veterans.
[1:30:29.740 --> 1:30:38.740]  I'm going to get an Emmy for this. Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch. I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[1:30:38.740 --> 1:30:53.740]  While other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted vulgar remarks on Twitter, calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.

[1:33:19.740 --> 1:33:37.740]  There is a war. There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose science has come. We are the resistance. We are the InfoWars.
[1:33:37.740 --> 1:34:01.740]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Now that's a promo. We've been running for about four years and I intended to take the government back. I intended to promote national sovereignty worldwide. I intended to promote prosperity. I intended to promote renaissance because renaissance was Europe coming out of the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages, with centralized groups that had books and machines and hot air balloons and everything else.
[1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:13.740]  They just didn't want the public to have it so if you tried to be an apothecary and have some herbs to treat illness, they'd kill you and say you were a witch. All knowledge was under attack.
[1:34:13.740 --> 1:34:22.740]  You had the false revolution in France that was the left hand path, Jacobian Satanism. That's mainline history books. That's the leftist today.
[1:34:22.740 --> 1:34:33.740]  And I've had historians on Lord Moncton. He concurs, you name it. I talk about all the witches and devil worshipers nationally in Rolling Stone and CNN calling for Trump's death last Friday and Saturday and mass rituals.
[1:34:33.740 --> 1:34:43.740]  And what did they do? They have articles out in right wing watch, you name it, saying I'm crazy imagining that we're fighting a cultist. I'm not the weirdo that believes in all that. They do.
[1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:51.740]  But our revolution, our 1776, was the renaissance, the real one. There's always a counterfeit.
[1:34:51.740 --> 1:34:58.740]  So we're looking at the reality of things and they can't say, oh, there's no world government. Oh, there's no a cult or there's no this, there's no that.
[1:34:58.740 --> 1:35:08.740]  Now, I knew who Ted Malik was, but guests sneak up on me and of course, you know, it's known Trump for 40 years, been involved in the State Department and then all sorts of things as a consultant and banking, you name it.
[1:35:08.740 --> 1:35:15.740]  So he's got a bigger pedigree, not just in journalism, three times, number one, New York Times bestseller, guy that changed admittedly at least one elections outcome.
[1:35:15.740 --> 1:35:27.740]  You know, he's he's credited with that. Probably three. But the point is, he knows a lot of people. And so at the inauguration, I saw him walking by said hi to me with Farage and of course Ted Malik.
[1:35:27.740 --> 1:35:33.740]  And I'm like, I recognize that guy. And I'm like, oh, yeah. Of course, they were already building him in the news as the ambassador is that's who Trump wants.
[1:35:33.740 --> 1:35:40.740]  But the EU saying don't do it. But then I started remembering when I was reading his bio, I was like head of the Aspen Institute.
[1:35:40.740 --> 1:35:48.740]  And I was like, I remember reading in mainstream news bio, you know, the head of Davos on the executive board, that's that's heading up Davos.
[1:35:48.740 --> 1:36:00.740]  And I was like, whoa, now this is this guy's. But then I did some more looking right for one on here. And he was the nationalist view in there, wanting people to come to work together but not transfer all the power critic of TPP.
[1:36:00.740 --> 1:36:11.740]  So I would say he's an internationalist. That's how they sold a lot of young people back when my dad was a young person. And top of his classes, they called you in, we're going to create an international order and the US is going to run it.
[1:36:11.740 --> 1:36:17.740]  We're going to empower the planet. It was 1776 worldwide. But then you learn later, that's not really what it is.
[1:36:17.740 --> 1:36:30.740]  Once you get the higher level Harvard PhDs, like Henry Kissinger got or Francis Boyle got and Boyle's went at the highest levels and he's exposed the whole thing because he was there. They were intending him to do all this. But he was a sleeper cell, just like Trump was.
[1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:43.740]  Trump knew this stuff before I was born. Of course, he said, I mean, he learned from Roy Cohn 10 years his lawyer, who was in all the secret papers, how our government funded communism, the Bolsheviks all of it, and he was trying to stop that.
[1:36:43.740 --> 1:36:58.740]  So there's always been a resistance before I was born to this. The question is, why does the EU not want Ted Malik? Because they know, I was telling Corsair during the break, I said, is this his rehabilitation, you know, coming on the Alex Jones show?
[1:36:58.740 --> 1:37:08.740]  And he said, well, he's been rehabilitated for a while. So it's not that I'm endorsing a globalist. I'm explaining, we better get ready to win. We better get ready for mass defections over to our side.
[1:37:08.740 --> 1:37:21.740]  We better get ready to actually restore all this. I keep saying, I wasn't up for saying this all these years, just to, you know, scare people. It was real. We got involved, you took action everywhere, nationalism surging, optimism surging.
[1:37:21.740 --> 1:37:33.740]  The globalist model of making us poor and dependent is in trouble. What we're fighting is a very ugly, stinking, failed criminal, authoritarian, criminal ideology.
[1:37:33.740 --> 1:37:42.740]  It's easy to beat. If you have confidence, call their bluff and move forward. And we're playing the Trump card. So I'm going to, of course, you have about five, 10 minutes to have the floor.
[1:37:42.740 --> 1:37:56.740]  Just not, not so much about Malik, him some two, but just getting ready to win, getting ready to overturn the globalist. You understand, they always try to brand us as, oh, look at Jones is upset. Jones is angry sometimes.
[1:37:56.740 --> 1:38:06.740]  Look, he's a loser. They played clips on Fox News last night of going, look, he says he's setting brush fires in the minds of men and women. In fact, while he's talking, trying to find us on media matters where they have it on the five.
[1:38:06.740 --> 1:38:18.740]  They have the Democrat that's on there, whatever his name is, Democratic strategist. And I forget his name and he's, they're playing it like it's funny. And like I'm stupid saying, we're away. We're taking action. We're human.
[1:38:18.740 --> 1:38:30.740]  We're finding our will again. We're getting up off the couch. We're killing our apathy. They're like, aha, that's funny because they want to keep you on the couch, folks. And even Fox News, all these backhanded attacks on Trump.
[1:38:30.740 --> 1:38:44.740]  It's about controlling conservative opposition. That's what Murdoch's always wanted. And he tried this coup last year with Ailes. It still didn't work, did it? Everyone rejected Megan Kelly. She destroyed herself. She self-immolated.
[1:38:44.740 --> 1:38:54.740]  So they've got a very, very delicate balancing act to do. But going back to Dr. Corsi and Doc, I'm going to go ahead and sign the lease today.
[1:38:54.740 --> 1:39:03.740]  The folks came through the last week and a half buying the products and things. We made back about half the money that we lost with Google, denying us to be able to advertise on the Google platform.
[1:39:03.740 --> 1:39:10.740]  Incredible discrimination, but I want to thank the listeners. So I have faith in the listeners that will make up the rest and be able to expand this year in the face of it.
[1:39:10.740 --> 1:39:17.740]  Plus, it's our duty. We're going to do it. So I'll get that lease signed today or tomorrow. And then we can sign the deal to get some obvious, probably rented furniture, computers, whatever you need.
[1:39:17.740 --> 1:39:23.740]  Let's just get it in there and start staffing it because it's our duty to take these guys on, especially now that we're starting to win.
[1:39:23.740 --> 1:39:31.740]  But can you speak about Malik himself and then you're the super nationalist, that guy that even more than Lou Dobbs, who deserves great credit and had top ratings on CNN, and they fired him.
[1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:42.740]  And that's why they're in the tank. Who would the lone guy out there writing books going on TV almost every week with Lou Dobbs, World Net Daily coming on this show, saying globalism, TPP, NAFTA, get
[1:39:42.740 --> 1:39:49.740]  Transpacific Partnership, getting the secret documents with Judicial Watch. I'm not trying to build you up. I want folks to know how we beat them in the past.
[1:39:49.740 --> 1:40:00.740]  We were way behind then. So if you're endorsing this guy, I'm just going to go off your endorsement, even though I have actually put him on TV before, talked about Davos and said, look at this scum.
[1:40:00.740 --> 1:40:09.740]  And just in general, I said, look at this scum. I haven't seen bad stuff from Malik's done. But I mean, I'm just, if you vouch for him, because we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[1:40:09.740 --> 1:40:16.740]  You know, I know Trump read your books. A lot of his views are also based on what you've done. So let's just say you've already culturally shaped this Second American Revolution.
[1:40:16.740 --> 1:40:24.740]  So if, you know, a guy that's like right up there with Patrick Henry or, you know, John Adams or somebody that's, I mean, who was the beer brewer or Sam Adams?
[1:40:24.740 --> 1:40:31.740]  You know, your business guy is successful out there spending your money, your treasure to get the word out as an American ideologue.
[1:40:31.740 --> 1:40:40.740]  Let's talk about Malik and let's talk about the phenomenon. If we've got to get out of the phenomenon of being losers and not that we were everywhere or the outside group.
[1:40:40.740 --> 1:40:50.740]  We have to get ready to go in, restore the Republic and then deliver to break the back of collect, to break the back, as I've said, as you've said, as Bannon said, of collectivism. Go ahead.
[1:40:50.740 --> 1:41:00.740]  Well, first of all, you're exactly right. We've been fighting this battle for a long time. Malik, I've known for years. Malik was never a globalist.
[1:41:00.740 --> 1:41:10.740]  He always, yes, he went to the UN. He had a position in Geneva. He worked with Davos at the highest levels. He ran the Aspen Institute.
[1:41:10.740 --> 1:41:20.740]  But he's an American. He's in the Theodore Roosevelt PhD taught at Yale. He's taught at Oxford. His credentials are impeccable.
[1:41:20.740 --> 1:41:35.740]  He's known at the highest levels of the business community internationally. He's very modest, but I've seen him run seminars with 200 of the biggest companies on a constant basis for years for some of the major accounting firms.
[1:41:35.740 --> 1:41:45.740]  Ted is internationally well known, but the unique thing about Ted Malik, and this is why I endorse him. It's why I've worked with him so strongly.
[1:41:45.740 --> 1:42:00.740]  God's memoirs published is that he never believed the lies of the globalists and he went to Davos. He went to Aspen thinking that he could fight it, thinking that he could still preserve the fundamental values.
[1:42:00.740 --> 1:42:13.740]  He has always been a constitutionalist. He's always been very religious, very determined Christian, and always determined to have the values of our constitution and founding fathers be preserved.
[1:42:13.740 --> 1:42:20.740]  Now, it was a losing battle to think that we could transform the global organizations. And Ted realized this.
[1:42:20.740 --> 1:42:40.740]  The remarkable thing is that he's from the inside, Ted Malik, testifying how morally depraved, how empty, how completely at a loss, how much of a failure the EU is, the United Nations, all the globalist dream, the International Monetary Fund,
[1:42:40.740 --> 1:42:50.740]  the idea that we're going to go to this transnational world government. Ted Malik has fought this for at least the last 20 years, maybe 30 years of his career.
[1:42:50.740 --> 1:43:02.740]  And I introduced Malik to Donald Trump. And I also was working very strongly with Nigel Farage. I've worked with the whole group in the Brexit movement.
[1:43:02.740 --> 1:43:14.740]  We're reaching across to the Europe, where Ted Malik frightens so deeply the Europeans is because he is highly intelligent. He's got the credentials.
[1:43:14.740 --> 1:43:27.740]  He's been there. And from the inside, he knows how morally depraved, completely vacuous, how cynical, and how dangerous these new world order organizations are.
[1:43:27.740 --> 1:43:43.740]  So Ted has fought issues like against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. His book is really worth reading. His book on Aspen Davos, his whole experience with the memoirs, I really strongly recommend.
[1:43:43.740 --> 1:43:57.740]  And spending time with Nigel Farage and Ted, I can tell you that the Europeans who are with Trump view Ted Malik as one of their strongest allies.
[1:43:57.740 --> 1:44:05.740]  Ted published over 40 editorials supporting Trump. He's been on the BBC constantly. His life has been threatened.
[1:44:05.740 --> 1:44:15.740]  The EU has said that if Donald Trump dares to nominate Ted Malik as EU ambassador, that the EU won't accept him or reject him.
[1:44:15.740 --> 1:44:25.740]  Now, how ridiculous is that? I mean, you've got a European Union thinking that they can tell the United States of America that they won't accept our ambassador.
[1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:29.740]  And I think Donald Trump will have the courage to look at this nomination.
[1:44:29.740 --> 1:44:39.740]  Steve Bannon has been very strongly supportive of Ted Malik. Ted has gone through all the different rungs. He's really strongly been interviewed.
[1:44:39.740 --> 1:44:43.740]  That's why the EU doesn't want him, and that tells you everything you need to know.
[1:44:43.740 --> 1:44:50.740]  In fact, so I revised what I said. It's not his rehabilitation even with the public. It's that he's been on the inside.
[1:44:50.740 --> 1:44:59.740]  And I know so many other people like on the left, Joseph Sticklets, who's won a Nobel Prizes for Economics and another Nobel Prize.
[1:44:59.740 --> 1:45:05.740]  He left in 2002, a bunch of documents got leaked, and he said, I don't care if it's leftist or right-wingers inside the global system.
[1:45:05.740 --> 1:45:15.740]  Globalism was sold on the idea of helping the poor and building up civilization. Instead, it's a race to the bottom, ripping people off, consolidating countries and imploding them.
[1:45:15.740 --> 1:45:22.740]  Now the megabanks, they want to take over the Europe and the US and implode them and suck them dry. I'm warning everyone.
[1:45:22.740 --> 1:45:28.740]  So that was a 2002 warning. He came on the show. And so now it's not just, you know, Sticklets, it's people like Malik.
[1:45:28.740 --> 1:45:38.740]  There are good people that are on the inside who tried to fix it on the inside. In fact, that's what Francis Boyle, who has that top PhD, the only give one of a year.
[1:45:38.740 --> 1:45:45.740]  That's secret PhD basically at Harvard. I know you're aware of that. And where they actually tell you how it all works and how to be a top technician.
[1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:50.740]  Only one of them a year. And he already actually knew about it and then didn't use it once he got it.
[1:45:50.740 --> 1:45:59.740]  So, you know, the point is there's not many of these people that actually have been given the globalist inside scoop who then actually oppose it.
[1:45:59.740 --> 1:46:01.740]  That's why they don't want him in there.
[1:46:01.740 --> 1:46:09.740]  Well, and Alex, I may never mention this to you, but when I was at Harvard, I got my PhD at Harvard. Harvard paid my entire tuition.
[1:46:09.740 --> 1:46:20.740]  They paid me to go to Harvard. I was paid $1,000 a month to be at Harvard at that time. I never really, I was finished with all my requirements at the end of about a year.
[1:46:20.740 --> 1:46:26.740]  I had four years to be there. I was given full reign of whatever I wanted to do at Harvard or MIT.
[1:46:26.740 --> 1:46:35.740]  But I never paid a penny to go to Harvard. They invited me to come and paid the entire tuition and all the, you know, books and other costs.
[1:46:35.740 --> 1:46:37.740]  But at the end, they wanted you to serve the New World Order.
[1:46:37.740 --> 1:46:44.740]  Well, and they did. And that was one of, just like 10, I wouldn't do it. That was not my, I did.
[1:46:44.740 --> 1:46:53.740]  The New World Order is at its heart satanic and its death. It is basically wanting to reduce the population of the United States.
[1:46:53.740 --> 1:47:03.740]  The world, actually, reduce the population of the world. It's an elitist organization where the elite thinks that they can tell all the rest of the people on the face of the earth what to do.
[1:47:03.740 --> 1:47:12.740]  It has no respect for people, this elite. It's constantly wanting to create wars, control money. It's corrupt on the inside.
[1:47:12.740 --> 1:47:16.740]  Look at how they admit Bill O'Mellon to Gates won a world government headed up by Chelsea.
[1:47:16.740 --> 1:47:23.740]  But now they're saying they want it to be Oprah Winfrey to run in 2020. They believe she will defeat Trump and bring in what Hillary couldn't.
[1:47:23.740 --> 1:47:29.740]  Yeah, well, come on, Oprah. Give it a try. I mean, she's, she's never really sustained what it takes to be president.
[1:47:29.740 --> 1:47:39.740]  Donald Trump has been at this since the 1990s. Read Roger Stone's book, Making You the President 2016. This was not a new idea from Donald.
[1:47:39.740 --> 1:47:44.740]  Absolutely. And I've talked to Roger. He doesn't like to brag because then they use it and, you know, try to make Trump mad or whatever.
[1:47:44.740 --> 1:47:51.740]  It's a constant manipulation. Alex is Trump's brain. Roger is Trump's brain. And it's not that Trump's weak minded.
[1:47:51.740 --> 1:47:56.740]  It manipulates him. It just continually is shoved in there by the people that are working against us.
[1:47:56.740 --> 1:48:01.740]  And so Roger doesn't like to brag about it. But I know you guys go way back and it's admitted.
[1:48:01.740 --> 1:48:05.740]  Ronald Reagan even wrote on a letter. He said, this guy's going to be president. There's something about him.
[1:48:05.740 --> 1:48:10.740]  And as you said, 40 years ago, you wrote this 15 years ago, you said Donald Trump's going to be president.
[1:48:10.740 --> 1:48:16.740]  I've, I've, I've thought about it since I first met him 40 years ago. I thought Donald Trump would be president.
[1:48:16.740 --> 1:48:24.740]  And the, look, Donald Trump is a highly intelligent guy. He's very, very smart and he's very effective leader.
[1:48:24.740 --> 1:48:30.740]  And he fundamentally agrees with us and he has always fundamentally agreed with us.
[1:48:30.740 --> 1:48:39.740]  In fact, his formative years, and nobody wants to say this, were with the most hardcore right-wingers in New York that it knew all the secrets that ran the
[1:48:39.740 --> 1:48:47.740]  Un-American Activities Committee. I mean, he literally, his lawyer, confidant, top advisor, mentor, Roy Cohn, who Hollywood demonizes,
[1:48:47.740 --> 1:48:56.740]  abs super hard-nosed, that, that, that's, that's, that's where Donald Trump got his, much of his worldview.
[1:48:56.740 --> 1:49:02.740]  That's right. I mean, see, Donald Trump, it doesn't need anybody's coaching. He doesn't need any, he'll think for himself.
[1:49:02.740 --> 1:49:08.740]  But he's gotten around him some very good people. Ted Malik has had been a major influence in Europe.
[1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:13.740]  Ted's taking a lot of flack for this. His, his life has been threatened. He's been demeaned.
[1:49:13.740 --> 1:49:20.740]  I could see it in his body language. He knows he's doing the right thing. And I could tell he's pretty, not freaked out, but you could tell he was like a guy walking in front of a
[1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:21.740]  firing squad.
[1:49:21.740 --> 1:49:23.740]  Well, and he'll continue to say.
[1:49:23.740 --> 1:49:29.740]  Can you imagine a top globalist just walks on our show and says, I'm working against this. And as you said behind the scenes,
[1:49:29.740 --> 1:49:37.740]  because I know there's been a whole Americana agenda within globalism. In fact, some say it was even planned, but that gets a little too, too sophisticated.
[1:49:37.740 --> 1:49:44.740]  Well, you know, all these, these Bob Beckles who attacked you on Fox, and I saw that Bob Beckles a hack. He's attacked me.
[1:49:44.740 --> 1:49:54.740]  I mean, you know, he's, he's had an alcoholic past. He's, it's hard to tell whether he's more objectionable or one, one Williams or even now,
[1:49:54.740 --> 1:50:08.740]  but he's more shift steward and the separate Smith and you've got Chris Wallace on Sunday bashing Trump, Fox is no longer a conservative network. The way it was. I'm sorry to say that, but it's just not.
[1:50:08.740 --> 1:50:12.740]  You've got Hannity who's very strong and others who are very conservative.
[1:50:12.740 --> 1:50:21.740]  Other than that, it's constant because I watch it when I exercise the morning and at night and I go to bed. It's backhanded attacks constantly and distant and like, Oh, he said the media is the enemy.
[1:50:21.740 --> 1:50:25.720]  the enemy. That's like a dictator. He said the fake news is the enemy. Again, even Fox
[1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:33.660]  News is, Shep Smith is disgusting. It's disgusting. And they attack you, Alex, and in for wars
[1:50:33.660 --> 1:50:41.380]  because you've been so effective, because you've developed across the country an attachment
[1:50:41.380 --> 1:50:45.940]  to a large middle class that Richard Nixon used to call the silent majority. I mean,
[1:50:45.940 --> 1:50:51.260]  I saw it with Ronald Reagan, the elite in the United States, the elite around the world,
[1:50:51.260 --> 1:50:55.500]  the GOP establishment, all hated Ronald Reagan. That's right. Let's talk about now that Trump's
[1:50:55.500 --> 1:51:00.100]  delivering and really is in charge now, that speech last night, how the elites tried back.
[1:51:00.100 --> 1:51:06.940]  Hi there, Dick Holger here. I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[1:51:06.940 --> 1:51:13.500]  I normally never do commercial endorsements. I am very skeptical of health supplements,
[1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:19.420]  but a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One, so I purchased a bottle and
[1:51:19.420 --> 1:51:25.420]  my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now. I very much dislike so-called energy boosters,
[1:51:25.420 --> 1:51:30.620]  those little energy drinks that have caffeine and Guarana and other things that make your heart
[1:51:30.620 --> 1:51:37.460]  race. This is not that. My experience with Synergy One has been great. My mood is better. My joints
[1:51:37.460 --> 1:51:43.900]  feel better. I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity. My wife and I both
[1:51:43.900 --> 1:51:49.980]  noticed that we even dream more, so I recommend Synergy One. It's really good stuff. I'm having
[1:51:49.980 --> 1:51:59.500]  great results with it. Call 888-988-3325 or visit 1worldway.com. That's 1worldwhy.com.
[1:52:00.060 --> 1:52:05.660]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's in an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[1:52:05.660 --> 1:52:11.500]  In the early 1980s, a child was born. Two of them actually. Their names were Jeff and Andy. Time went
[1:52:11.500 --> 1:52:16.780]  by, they developed facial hair, and one day something happened. Andy got ripped off buying
[1:52:16.780 --> 1:52:21.580]  overpriced razors, so they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for
[1:52:21.580 --> 1:52:26.940]  all. They hired the best designers. They bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started
[1:52:26.940 --> 1:52:31.340]  selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers. How did the
[1:52:31.340 --> 1:52:36.780]  overpriced razor company respond? By threatening to sue their pants off. Don't worry, Jeff and Andy
[1:52:36.780 --> 1:52:42.700]  have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to get all guys a great shave at a great price. Try Harry's

[1:54:13.500 --> 1:54:33.420]  I wish that I could fly into the sky, so very high, just like the dragons fly.
[1:54:33.420 --> 1:54:49.260]  I was just talking to Zach, one of our researchers in there. He's the guy you see pulling up the
[1:54:49.260 --> 1:54:54.060]  articles almost as fast as I can say him. He's like, oh yeah, Ted Malik, he just read like 20
[1:54:54.060 --> 1:54:58.700]  articles about the globalist in the last decade, threw him off everything, went after him, because
[1:54:58.700 --> 1:55:02.860]  he was openly criticizing him, and I guess in their private councils doing it, so I should have
[1:55:02.860 --> 1:55:06.780]  introduced the guy as a hero. The head of the Aspen Institute doesn't get more elite than that.
[1:55:06.780 --> 1:55:11.740]  That's like Davos U.S. on the board of the Davos group. That is so prestigious, and I remember
[1:55:12.620 --> 1:55:16.060]  the hearings on the show, and then seeing his face, and I've already done research, I was like,
[1:55:16.060 --> 1:55:21.420]  wow, and Dr. Corsi's endorsing this guy, so now I really feel good about what Dr. Corsi's saying
[1:55:21.420 --> 1:55:25.820]  and doing. How could Trump not put this guy in as the ambassador? I want to talk about how the
[1:55:25.820 --> 1:55:30.060]  Empire is going to strike back here, Dr. Corsi. But first, going back to you just briefly here,
[1:55:30.060 --> 1:55:35.740]  how about the phenomenon of the Liberty Movement thinking we're always supposed to be in the
[1:55:35.740 --> 1:55:40.700]  hills waiting for the UN troops to come? I always said, no, take over your city councils, run for
[1:55:40.700 --> 1:55:46.860]  office, our ideas are bulletproof. No army can stop an idea whose time has come to quote the
[1:55:46.860 --> 1:55:52.380]  French philosopher and statesman, Victor Hugo. I mean, now is the time, and so we're having victory.
[1:55:52.380 --> 1:55:56.860]  We're not offering some utopia like the communists or socialists or one-worlders. We're not even
[1:55:56.860 --> 1:56:01.500]  saying we shouldn't have global alliances, but it has to be deals based on sovereignty and based
[1:56:01.500 --> 1:56:07.660]  on equity and based on humanity and based on basic principles. And so, wow, you know, great job. I
[1:56:07.660 --> 1:56:10.940]  know you've known Malik a long time, but getting him to come on the Alex Jones show, he obviously
[1:56:10.940 --> 1:56:16.060]  knew what he was doing. He has really crossed the Rubicon with the global snow. Well, he wanted to
[1:56:16.060 --> 1:56:21.260]  be on the Alex Jones show. We've talked about it for quite a long time. He thinks, and I think
[1:56:21.260 --> 1:56:26.460]  the Alex Jones audience is the most effective audience in America. And this is the group that
[1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:33.580]  has elected Trump. And I've been writing about Malik for a long time, but this was the key today
[1:56:33.580 --> 1:56:40.300]  because I think if our audience says, to Donald Trump, this is an important ambassador position.
[1:56:41.340 --> 1:56:48.300]  He's published books. I didn't even know this. Inside Davos, inside globalism, inside Aspen,
[1:56:48.300 --> 1:56:52.540]  and talk about inside, he ran them. Wow. I mean, no wonder. No wonder they don't want him in there.
[1:56:52.540 --> 1:56:57.900]  Well, and this is the key. I mean, he has seen it from the inside. So,
[1:56:58.860 --> 1:57:03.020]  Ted Malik. I should tell you, Trump wants to be like Theodore Roosevelt. This guy's name, Theodore
[1:57:03.020 --> 1:57:09.740]  Roosevelt, Malik. In fact, one of the first articles Ted wrote was how Donald Trump resembles Theodore
[1:57:09.740 --> 1:57:15.340]  Roosevelt and how his brand of speaking to the people going back to the fundamental values of
[1:57:15.340 --> 1:57:21.580]  America was the Theodore Roosevelt approach that really worked. And Donald Trump, in many ways,
[1:57:21.580 --> 1:57:25.340]  has characteristics similar to Theodore Roosevelt. I know you've got to go, but we've got to go
[1:57:25.340 --> 1:57:27.820]  to break. Can you do five more minutes to talk about how do you think the empire is going to
[1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:31.900]  strike back? Absolutely. I'm going to come right back to Dr. Corsi for a moment. I've got a plug,
[1:57:31.900 --> 1:57:35.420]  okay, because you know the enemies doing all sorts of stuff behind the scenes too, which is,
[1:57:35.420 --> 1:57:40.540]  I understand it. I'm not complaining. I'm in a war. Just know this is a war. They're not just trying
[1:57:40.540 --> 1:57:45.100]  to pull our funding. It's everything else you can imagine. Please go get the t-shirts Trump
[1:57:45.100 --> 1:57:51.180]  Pence 2020, keeping America great on the front. America first in 1776, infowars.com on the back,
[1:57:51.180 --> 1:57:54.860]  to get in the face of the bullies, to spread the word, to meet like-minded patriots.
[1:57:54.860 --> 1:57:59.020]  And we are about to stop as soon as this shirt comes in next week and pre-order it, get it $9.95.
[1:57:59.020 --> 1:58:03.100]  It goes up to $19.95 when we get it in next week. Pre-order now, you'll be the first to get it.
[1:58:03.100 --> 1:58:08.220]  Hillary for President 2017, George Soros, the deport George Soros in the back. I'm going to stop
[1:58:08.220 --> 1:58:12.940]  selling these as well. So we're not making any more of those. This is the new shirt I want to
[1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:19.900]  focus on, Trump Pence 2020, infowarsstore.com, or triple 825-33139. And today's the final day,
[1:58:19.900 --> 1:58:24.220]  the mega specials that we launched last week when they censored us, try to raise capital back.
[1:58:24.220 --> 1:58:28.140]  I've got to stop with a lot of stuff starting to sell out. Brain force, survival shield,
[1:58:28.140 --> 1:58:32.700]  super male, super female. They're all amazing products, five star reviews on third party sites.
[1:58:32.700 --> 1:58:38.620]  Check them out for yourself. Caveman, Paleo, and so much more. It's all selling out as we speak,
[1:58:38.620 --> 1:58:43.820]  infowarsstore.com. Thank you for the support. You are the resistance. You're supporting yourself,
[1:58:43.820 --> 1:59:09.820]  and God bless you. And please don't forget those prayers. We need them. I'm praying for you.
[1:59:14.380 --> 1:59:21.100]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America? They lost. We won. Want to see what Trump's up against.
[1:59:21.100 --> 1:59:26.620]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paula beers. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud
[1:59:26.620 --> 1:59:34.540]  of the flag. Heritage, mom, and apple pie. And beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global
[1:59:34.540 --> 1:59:39.900]  government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available. Starring Alex Jones,
[1:59:39.900 --> 1:59:45.580]  Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin. Want to shed some tears over the red,
[1:59:45.580 --> 1:59:49.820]  white, and blue? RevelationTheMovie.info. Let's fix it.
[1:59:49.820 --> 2:00:09.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:09.820 --> 2:00:20.300]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do
[2:00:20.300 --> 2:00:27.660]  nothing. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We now take you live
[2:00:27.660 --> 2:00:34.540]  to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones. We've been rolling that liner for 10 years.
[2:00:34.540 --> 2:00:39.420]  Notice it happened. In fact, soon we'll have to stop playing the liners. It won't be.
[2:00:40.940 --> 2:00:44.060]  You know, in FEMA Region 6, because then FEMA will just be an emergency agency,
[2:00:44.060 --> 2:00:49.100]  not something to take over and have 10 regions as COG admits it is. We have to be ready to win.
[2:00:51.180 --> 2:00:53.340]  We have to understand that the high command
[2:00:55.580 --> 2:00:59.740]  is the golden rule. And it's exactly what Trump said, laying down your life for others,
[2:00:59.740 --> 2:01:03.420]  laying down your name, being attacked. It doesn't matter because you know you're right.
[2:01:03.420 --> 2:01:07.820]  We're changing the world. You are the info war. I don't just say that. You are the info war.
[2:01:07.820 --> 2:01:13.100]  You're the reason it's happening. But so many people, and it's a meme that MSM is putting out,
[2:01:13.100 --> 2:01:17.500]  I'm a bootlicker. I'm with the establishment now. No, when I disagree with Trump, I'm going to
[2:01:17.500 --> 2:01:21.020]  disagree. And from the position of law opposition, it'll have a bigger effect.
[2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:29.500]  The point is, is that Trump listens to real counsel. He doesn't listen to BS. He listens
[2:01:29.500 --> 2:01:33.820]  to people with a track record of telling the truth. And you have to understand this is real.
[2:01:33.820 --> 2:01:37.100]  It's not going to be perfect. But think of what it would have been like with Hillary.
[2:01:37.100 --> 2:01:41.100]  Why are the elites so upset because Trump's the real deal? So let's not be too confident, though.
[2:01:41.100 --> 2:01:44.860]  We're in the fight of our lives. We're in like the sixth round. We've turned the corner. We're
[2:01:44.860 --> 2:01:48.700]  starting to win. But there's six more rounds. Dr. Corsi and the three minutes we have left.
[2:01:48.700 --> 2:01:52.060]  How do you see the empire striking back? I see him trying to implode the economy
[2:01:52.060 --> 2:01:54.380]  and blame Trump. They admit they're doing that. What else do you see?
[2:01:54.380 --> 2:01:59.500]  Well, yes, you're going to see very quickly the Federal Reserve raising interest rates,
[2:01:59.500 --> 2:02:04.780]  trying to implode the economy. They kept interest rates at zero to prop up Obama,
[2:02:04.780 --> 2:02:11.980]  $10 trillion worth of debt. The fight is going to be in the precincts and the school boards
[2:02:11.980 --> 2:02:16.300]  and local communities. The Democrats are going to do everything they can. The far left. And
[2:02:16.300 --> 2:02:23.180]  I just submitted an article with Perez, Tom Perez, head of the DNC, and Keith Ellison,
[2:02:23.180 --> 2:02:29.340]  the first Muslim and elected in Congress, a member of the nation of Islam up until 2006.
[2:02:29.340 --> 2:02:33.900]  The Democrats have just taken a far turn left. The Democrats are going hard left.
[2:02:33.900 --> 2:02:38.380]  They're going full in socialists there. This is the, you know, this is the communist takeover
[2:02:38.380 --> 2:02:44.060]  movement attempt of their lifetime. And the Democrats are not rhetoric. It's flaming Bolshevik
[2:02:44.060 --> 2:02:50.540]  garbage. Right. Go take a look at the Communist Party of the United States of America. It's
[2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:55.260]  agenda and its website. It's program is indistinguishable.
[2:02:55.260 --> 2:02:58.700]  By the way, listen, listen, I don't just grovel the police, but I'm for law and order.
[2:02:58.700 --> 2:03:02.380]  The communist groups are openly calling for cops to be killed. If I did that, I'd be arrested,
[2:03:02.380 --> 2:03:06.620]  rightfully so. They're trying to organize crime. Why isn't the attorney general already moving
[2:03:06.620 --> 2:03:10.220]  against them? I don't care if the left calls it fascism. They're the fascists.
[2:03:11.740 --> 2:03:17.420]  Jeff Sessions is going to move against it. But the whole Black Lives Matter, the whole attempt to
[2:03:17.420 --> 2:03:23.420]  intimidate police, the elections got to destroy police because it's fundamental to the law and
[2:03:23.420 --> 2:03:28.300]  order of a civil society. Why are they so arrogant? Don't they know that they've waken the sleeping
[2:03:28.300 --> 2:03:33.020]  giant? They got a tiger by the tail? Well, we've, you know, we've done everything we can for the
[2:03:33.020 --> 2:03:38.700]  last 20 years to help America. And I certainly have, you certainly have. And America's listened.
[2:03:38.700 --> 2:03:43.900]  I mean, it's taken very detailed investigative research. It's taken producing the truth. But
[2:03:43.900 --> 2:03:49.100]  Americans out there by the millions are wakening up. They're listening. They're paying attention.
[2:03:49.100 --> 2:03:53.420]  Dr. How exciting is it for you to see the hard work you've done and Ron Paul's done and how we
[2:03:53.420 --> 2:03:57.820]  were ridiculed, attacked, demonized? Isn't it satisfying, not an arrogant way, but at a spiritual
[2:03:57.820 --> 2:04:04.060]  level, the victory we're having? I feel like Alex, it was the right thing to do. And I feel like,
[2:04:04.620 --> 2:04:09.980]  you know, I get so identified with what Donald Trump said last night. This, the military who
[2:04:09.980 --> 2:04:16.300]  died in the battlefield, they didn't ask for any riches or their names to be put up in the stars.
[2:04:16.300 --> 2:04:22.060]  I'll take a bow when all the Americans who have died for this country in battle have their chance
[2:04:22.060 --> 2:04:27.180]  to stand up and take a bow. Right after that, I'll take a bow. That's right. And I saw you,
[2:04:27.180 --> 2:04:30.540]  if you were on the line for 20 minutes with Roger Stone while we were finishing the speech,
[2:04:30.540 --> 2:04:34.300]  he went over and I saw you had tears in your eyes when Trump was saying that.
[2:04:34.300 --> 2:04:37.740]  And that's the difference. They think we're weak because we care. No, we're strong because we care.
[2:04:37.740 --> 2:04:41.660]  Dr. Corsi, I'm signing that lease to get the bureau going. We're going to get those offices right
[2:04:41.660 --> 2:04:44.860]  there where you want them. I'm going to sign that today. And we're going to get this moving forward
[2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:49.100]  when we start getting that crew hired. They hurt us last week, but the listeners came through. So
[2:04:49.100 --> 2:04:53.100]  we're going to get the Washington bureau set up. Thank you, sir. Great. I'm excited about it.
[2:04:53.100 --> 2:04:57.660]  Look forward to it. Thank you. All right. Thank you. That's right. The Washington D.C. Command
[2:04:57.660 --> 2:05:04.380]  Center of the People's Media. Stay with us. Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't
[2:05:04.380 --> 2:05:10.860]  sink any lower. Last night's Trump's speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity
[2:05:10.860 --> 2:05:16.540]  to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country. Right after President Trump
[2:05:16.540 --> 2:05:22.460]  finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects like Michael Moore appeared on
[2:05:22.460 --> 2:05:29.660]  television to bash Donald Trump. This time for honoring, wait for it, veterans. I'm going to
[2:05:29.660 --> 2:05:37.100]  get an Emmy for this. Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch. I mean, this is the sickness
[2:05:37.100 --> 2:05:42.540]  of this man. Meanwhile, other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted
[2:05:42.540 --> 2:05:48.940]  vulgar remarks on Twitter, calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving
[2:05:48.940 --> 2:05:54.860]  once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder. I'm Darren McBrain and you can learn
[2:05:54.860 --> 2:06:04.300]  more right now at M4s.com. Today we call it bone broth. And for thousands of years, our ancestors
[2:06:04.300 --> 2:06:09.260]  enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets, a processed junk. We are now
[2:06:09.260 --> 2:06:15.580]  introducing caveman by M4sLife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric
[2:06:15.580 --> 2:06:21.660]  root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal super foods in a single great tasting formula.
[2:06:21.660 --> 2:06:26.460]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are
[2:06:26.460 --> 2:06:30.860]  our superior ancestors. And we need to do everything we can to recapture that. Everyone
[2:06:30.860 --> 2:06:35.420]  knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking,
[2:06:35.420 --> 2:06:41.500]  but you use the bones for strength, from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors,
[2:06:41.500 --> 2:06:46.380]  to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence.
[2:06:46.380 --> 2:06:50.780]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[2:06:50.780 --> 2:06:54.940]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want
[2:06:54.940 --> 2:07:00.460]  to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and M4sLife.com today. Hey everyone,

[2:07:19.580 --> 2:07:23.660]  or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person
[2:07:23.660 --> 2:07:27.660]  with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and

[2:08:23.740 --> 2:08:42.460]  Eric Clapton. He's one of my favorite musicians. What a prolific career. He's been around 50 plus years. Listen to this guitar.
[2:08:42.460 --> 2:08:51.420]  Imagine if they had performed this now with the recording they've got.
[2:09:02.300 --> 2:09:06.220]  Yeah, if I wasn't here fighting the globalist, I would be on a distant shore in the Pacific.
[2:09:06.220 --> 2:09:12.780]  100%. Now the spirit out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is so calm.
[2:09:20.300 --> 2:09:25.260]  It's like inviting death. So old, so clean.
[2:09:25.260 --> 2:09:33.580]  Here's the last part. Her name is Aphrodite.
[2:09:46.940 --> 2:09:47.900]  All right, enough of that.
[2:09:49.900 --> 2:09:54.380]  Unimpermirtial, but be sure to go to iTunes, even though they ban us from it. You can download your best of cream
[2:09:54.380 --> 2:10:05.740]  and Eric Clapton. Okay, let's get serious here. Wow. This happens all the time and I totally get it.
[2:10:05.740 --> 2:10:09.260]  He's got so many investigations going on, so much stuff he's handling that about half the time,
[2:10:10.140 --> 2:10:13.900]  even when he schedules for this one, he wants to come on. He gives us a lot of his closes and I
[2:10:13.900 --> 2:10:17.820]  appreciate it. And he's not ready to give us the exclusive and something came up. So they're holding
[2:10:17.820 --> 2:10:22.700]  on to something they were going to publish. And I guess the next few days, he will come on.
[2:10:22.700 --> 2:10:29.020]  That's projectveritas.com James O'Keefe. So we'll see what's going on with whatever. It was big that
[2:10:29.020 --> 2:10:32.540]  he was going to break here and also talk about a CNN tapes release last week. We'll get him on,
[2:10:32.540 --> 2:10:36.460]  obviously, in the next few days. That's fine because I've been promising to go to more calls
[2:10:37.180 --> 2:10:41.260]  and I'm encouraging David Knight and others who's just as bad as I am. We just want to cover news
[2:10:41.260 --> 2:10:45.340]  and then kind of don't get to the call sometimes to take your phone calls. And I'm trying to get
[2:10:45.340 --> 2:10:48.860]  better about not making you sit there on hold. I'm still bad, but not as bad as I used to be.
[2:10:48.860 --> 2:10:56.220]  800-2599-231-800-2599-231. I'm going to say it again, first-time callers,
[2:10:56.860 --> 2:10:59.820]  people that haven't been able to get through or folks that have been on hold that didn't get to you.
[2:10:59.820 --> 2:11:07.660]  800-2599-231-800-2599-231. About last night's speech, about where the world's going,
[2:11:09.100 --> 2:11:15.740]  about Oprah. I want to get to Oprah. And, you know, if you guys want to call in
[2:11:15.740 --> 2:11:23.020]  and disagree with me about my gushing over Trump, please call in and make your real point.
[2:11:23.020 --> 2:11:26.300]  I don't like the asset for which are seizures. A lot of that's unconstitutional.
[2:11:27.900 --> 2:11:31.500]  But then Trump's like, we could take yachts away from drug dealers. Yeah, but not old ladies,
[2:11:31.500 --> 2:11:36.300]  cash in East Texas in those corrupt towns. Most of them aren't corrupt, but when you get a bad
[2:11:36.300 --> 2:11:42.220]  town, unfortunately, Texas has got the best and the worst of police. And there are some bad places
[2:11:42.220 --> 2:11:46.860]  in East Texas. My family, by the way, on my dad's side is from there. So I know I'm not bashing
[2:11:47.580 --> 2:11:52.060]  people, but it's like an extension of the worst parts of Louisiana, right? People in Louisiana too,
[2:11:52.060 --> 2:11:57.100]  but we all know Louisiana's got its problem with corrupt police in some areas. And it just kind
[2:11:57.100 --> 2:12:03.900]  of extends in. I've never really seen a lot of white racism in my life. I really haven't.
[2:12:03.900 --> 2:12:07.900]  I've seen whites scared because the media makes them scared of everybody and overly guilty. But
[2:12:07.900 --> 2:12:12.860]  I have been in East Texas pulled over at 16 years of age with a half drunk six pack of beer,
[2:12:14.620 --> 2:12:17.900]  two girls in the car, my buddy coming back from the beach, driving back to Dallas.
[2:12:18.700 --> 2:12:24.060]  And because we both had blonde hair, the sheriff deputy rolled up a sleeve with a big swastika
[2:12:24.060 --> 2:12:30.860]  and said, howl Hitler, enjoy your beer. And I remember driving off going, man, it suck if you
[2:12:30.860 --> 2:12:35.660]  were black, got pulled over by that guy. It was I don't go off and you've got to have checks and
[2:12:35.660 --> 2:12:44.300]  balances on everybody because you can get pulled into a place run by black folks. And if they're
[2:12:44.300 --> 2:12:47.500]  racist, they're going to, well, white people did something to me. I'm going to do something to you.
[2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:50.380]  That's why you don't do something to somebody because of what color they are.
[2:12:51.420 --> 2:12:56.940]  You go off what somebody does and what they stand for and who they are. Like Martin Luther King said,
[2:12:56.940 --> 2:13:02.220]  you don't go off of. And I've had for the racist white stuff I've seen, I've got,
[2:13:02.220 --> 2:13:13.100]  I'm not going to exaggerate. It's just true. 300, 400 to one from black people. Now, does that mean
[2:13:13.100 --> 2:13:16.300]  I hate black people? Absolutely not because both black people are great, but there's a large minority
[2:13:16.300 --> 2:13:23.340]  of black people that are super racist. I would say there's even more racist than those black people.
[2:13:23.340 --> 2:13:27.740]  It's the liberals that watch MSNBC now that'll scream at you. Hundreds of them when I was in
[2:13:27.740 --> 2:13:34.060]  DC, FU white male. Sometimes a white male would say it. We've got it on video and people are like,
[2:13:34.060 --> 2:13:41.180]  that doesn't make sense. Now, I've even seen some of the more nationalistic kind of racist
[2:13:41.180 --> 2:13:46.620]  black sites even comment and say stuff about it and go, I think Alex Joe's got a point. It's weird
[2:13:46.620 --> 2:13:51.820]  to watch some cracker tell another cracker, FU, you're white. I mean, it's just, it's, it's weird.
[2:13:53.020 --> 2:13:57.260]  How did I go off on that, Jag? Oh, it's talking about asset for which are seizures.
[2:13:57.260 --> 2:14:01.340]  See, when I think about a subject, I think about all the angles to it. If it's adjudicated,
[2:14:01.340 --> 2:14:03.900]  if you're caught breaking the law and you've done something and there's laws on the books,
[2:14:03.900 --> 2:14:07.980]  then you should do it. But it should be at the state level. There's been too much federal control
[2:14:07.980 --> 2:14:13.660]  over local police via because the feds lobbying to get laws passed where states can't have asset
[2:14:13.660 --> 2:14:20.060]  for which are, or if they do 80 plus percent of the money goes to the general fund instead of it,
[2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:22.460]  in case of Texas, instead of it just going to the police. So if you're going to have,
[2:14:23.020 --> 2:14:26.380]  you know, the argument was, well, we got local police doing bad things. Let's have the feds run
[2:14:26.380 --> 2:14:31.660]  it. The feds are even worse. Now, maybe we're going to clean out all these bad feds. But,
[2:14:31.660 --> 2:14:36.860]  I mean, let's say I'm not an enemy of the feds, the average FBI agents more awake to the general
[2:14:36.860 --> 2:14:44.700]  public. I just experienced it as I got more prominent. I mean, I bet a third of the FBI
[2:14:44.700 --> 2:14:49.900]  agents in Austin today are listening to the show. I mean, you know, so it again, there are best
[2:14:49.900 --> 2:14:55.500]  friend, there are worst enemy, wherever there's power, you're going to have that dichotomy,
[2:14:55.500 --> 2:14:59.580]  that paradox with great power comes with responsibility and you need oversight over it.
[2:15:00.300 --> 2:15:03.900]  And that's all I'm saying. So I don't like Trump on the asset for which are seizure thing. I mean,
[2:15:03.900 --> 2:15:07.820]  just we haven't seen the specific plans yet, but it's just, it's, it's, we already got too much
[2:15:07.820 --> 2:15:13.740]  of it. It's already out of control. Clearly. I mean, everybody who's informed left or right center
[2:15:14.300 --> 2:15:20.780]  knows that there's an issue there. You expand on that, you know, sessions is, you know, we don't
[2:15:20.780 --> 2:15:23.820]  need marijuana sold on street corners. You know, it hurts a lot of people. And you know what,
[2:15:23.820 --> 2:15:27.660]  on average, it causes a lot of people to end up not really performing in life.
[2:15:28.220 --> 2:15:31.020]  Other really high strung people study show it helps. It's better than Prozac.
[2:15:32.140 --> 2:15:40.700]  It isn't a, no drug, no plant has more medicinal uses than Mary Jane. I mean,
[2:15:40.700 --> 2:15:45.980]  it is a gift from God. It's thousands of them. It's incredible. I want to decriminalize.
[2:15:45.980 --> 2:15:53.740]  And you've got sessions running around who I really love because he's a good guy. He
[2:15:53.740 --> 2:16:01.420]  means what he says. He does what he says, but it's just coming from somebody who is living in the
[2:16:01.420 --> 2:16:08.940]  1940s when they would in Alabama or Texas give you in some cases, 40 years, my mother knew
[2:16:08.940 --> 2:16:14.780]  people in college that got busted with marijuana in the 1960s that served over two decades for
[2:16:14.780 --> 2:16:22.540]  a couple of marijuana cigarettes. Now that's BS. Okay. That's all. And by the way, I don't like
[2:16:22.540 --> 2:16:27.340]  the whole marijuana culture. They're mad at me because I don't say that they're God and oh,
[2:16:27.340 --> 2:16:31.100]  it's wonderful. And their little stoner life stalls are great. Playing video games all day,
[2:16:31.100 --> 2:16:36.540]  smoking dope all the time. If you're a super type A personality like Joe Rogan, Joe probably lived
[2:16:36.540 --> 2:16:39.420]  until he's 90 years old because he won't have a heart attack because he smokes pot at night.
[2:16:39.420 --> 2:16:47.980]  I mean, Joe Rogan can go, you know, host major programs all the sleep with that
[2:16:47.980 --> 2:16:53.820]  ever smoking, you know, weed. I can't get out of a chair smoking the type of marijuana Joe Rogan
[2:16:53.820 --> 2:16:58.460]  smokes. So again, it's a very strong drug. It's been made a lot stronger. And so it's kind of a
[2:16:58.460 --> 2:17:06.700]  victim of its own, its own farming practices of its own botanical technology development.
[2:17:06.700 --> 2:17:10.700]  And see, I'm spending too much time. That's why I can't ever get to the news because I just want
[2:17:10.700 --> 2:17:15.820]  to pontificate on any subject. Attorney General Jeff Sissons just hinted at crackdown on legal
[2:17:15.820 --> 2:17:24.300]  marijuana. Well, he didn't, he didn't hint at it. He did it. This is a bad move. Support police
[2:17:25.100 --> 2:17:31.260]  getting training and funding and medical care they need and not demonizing police in the community
[2:17:31.260 --> 2:17:34.700]  and holding up the good officers as an example of real community policing.
[2:17:34.700 --> 2:17:39.820]  Make it an honorable profession. So we get more good people to be part of it. Pay them more and
[2:17:39.820 --> 2:17:47.740]  don't make it be based on revenue generation. That we don't want pirates. We want sheepdogs.
[2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:54.220]  And again, we don't want to run around going after half the young people to smoke pot.
[2:17:54.220 --> 2:17:59.420]  They're not going to quit smoking pot Senator Sessions. I know the Attorney General listens
[2:17:59.420 --> 2:18:06.780]  to the show. I'll just leave it at that. I know. I even know behind the scenes there were some
[2:18:06.780 --> 2:18:11.180]  moves made to keep before Obama even left and going after me and that the word was put out.
[2:18:11.180 --> 2:18:15.820]  You do that. We're going to overthrow it as soon as we get in. Sessions has been one of my biggest
[2:18:15.820 --> 2:18:21.980]  allies. I'm just saying, I'm your ally too, sir. And you don't want to start a fight with,
[2:18:21.980 --> 2:18:26.620]  what's the statistic? Something like 80% of America admits it smoked marijuana at one time
[2:18:26.620 --> 2:18:30.620]  or another. And then the last time I saw it was like 40-something percent smoking on a regular
[2:18:30.620 --> 2:18:34.620]  basis. Guys, Google how many Americans smoke marijuana in studies. I mean, it varies in the
[2:18:34.620 --> 2:18:37.420]  study, but those numbers are pretty accurate. I've seen it repeatedly.
[2:18:40.620 --> 2:18:46.140]  You can't do this. I mean, this is will be a disaster for Trump getting young people involved
[2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:53.420]  in the Liberty Movement. Here's the deal Sessions. If you call for banning liquor, then I would say
[2:18:53.420 --> 2:18:58.460]  it's not hypocritical, but liquor kills a lot. And I saw the quote from Sessions in my stack.
[2:18:58.460 --> 2:19:01.100]  This is why I'm going off on the shag. I was going to leave this alone, but I can't handle it.
[2:19:01.980 --> 2:19:07.740]  He said, marijuana causes people to be violent and causes violence. No, it doesn't.
[2:19:09.500 --> 2:19:14.700]  People don't get in fights on marijuana. They don't speed on it. They drive 40 in a 60 in the slow
[2:19:14.700 --> 2:19:24.460]  lane. I mean, alcohol causes violence and car wrecks. And by the way, that's my cup of tea.
[2:19:24.460 --> 2:19:28.540]  I'm just being honest about it. It's just crazy.
[2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:34.700]  Because one in eight U.S. adults say they smoke marijuana. Paul says I've seen numbers
[2:19:34.700 --> 2:19:38.940]  universally. The real study is higher than that. Well, look, George Soros, though, is for it.
[2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:42.860]  And that's why I don't want it pushed everybody because it's so weaponized. He wants you all
[2:19:42.860 --> 2:19:48.220]  zombied out. I want to try to balance this. And I just think it'll derail much of Trump's agenda
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:52.140]  to restore the Republic. If he does this, he should be more libertarian about it. All right,
[2:19:52.140 --> 2:19:56.460]  I'm going to come back, give the number out 800-25 at 99 who they want a bunch of news.
[2:19:56.460 --> 2:19:58.940]  Oprah wants to be president. We got that club to stay with us.
[2:20:00.460 --> 2:20:06.380]  Guys, are you tired of being tired, frustrated because it seems impossible to lose belly fat?
[2:20:06.380 --> 2:20:09.260]  If you're looking for a solution, then listen to Mark.
[2:20:09.260 --> 2:20:16.540]  I had fantastic results with the Andro 400 Mac. Probably lost 35 pounds. And more impressive
[2:20:16.540 --> 2:20:23.660]  than that was the inches I lost off of my belly and my waist. And the increased energy is fantastic.
[2:20:23.660 --> 2:20:28.780]  I'll be totally honest. I tried a different product and I wasn't happy with the different
[2:20:28.780 --> 2:20:34.780]  product. You guys are considerably cheaper than the other brand. And I can really feel the difference.
[2:20:34.780 --> 2:20:41.500]  Andro 400 Macs, the extra strength all natural testosterone booster, the safe, easy and affordable

[2:20:59.260 --> 2:21:06.620]  Hi there. Dick Holgeier here. I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[2:21:06.620 --> 2:21:12.860]  I normally never do commercial endorsements. I am very skeptical of health supplements.
[2:21:12.860 --> 2:21:18.860]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One. So I purchased a bottle and my
[2:21:18.860 --> 2:21:24.700]  wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now. I very much dislike so-called energy boosters.
[2:21:24.700 --> 2:21:30.460]  Those little energy drinks that have caffeine and Guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[2:21:30.460 --> 2:21:37.020]  This is not that. My experience with Synergy One has been great. My mood is better. My joints feel
[2:21:37.020 --> 2:21:43.740]  better. I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity. My wife and I both noticed
[2:21:43.740 --> 2:21:49.740]  that we even dream more. So I recommend Synergy One. It's really good stuff. I'm having great
[2:21:49.740 --> 2:21:58.860]  results with it. Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com. That's oneworldwhey.com.

[2:23:57.980 --> 2:24:08.060]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:24:28.060 --> 2:24:31.820]  That guy got down here and then he had this photographer who was an Austinite. We're going
[2:24:31.820 --> 2:24:36.700]  to call him and see if he remembers this. And it's not that big a deal except I would never
[2:24:36.700 --> 2:24:41.340]  say this. And I've talked to the whole crew. Unless we were talking about an interview about
[2:24:43.580 --> 2:24:52.300]  piece of gay and how, quote, Obama ordered $65,000 worth of hot dogs to a private party in
[2:24:52.300 --> 2:24:59.100]  Chicago and that's according to the FBI manuals. That means, you know, gay escorts.
[2:24:59.900 --> 2:25:05.420]  And the point is we're just reporting on this. But I was going back there to eat. I
[2:25:05.420 --> 2:25:10.060]  dumped, I was, I was open to this thing of, I was eating a hurry. It used to be on air. I was
[2:25:10.060 --> 2:25:15.420]  off air. I opened this thing of barbecue sauce and it splattered on my shirt. They're coming
[2:25:15.420 --> 2:25:19.820]  around the corner to come in. And sometimes I'll be honest, I keep it real cold around here.
[2:25:19.820 --> 2:25:23.660]  I have this thing where I get hot easy. I took my shirt off and it was also kind of,
[2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:27.900]  I don't give a crap. Every time I do that in the media, it's like something huge sensation.
[2:25:27.900 --> 2:25:32.620]  So I took my shirt off and they said, oh, some form of dominance or something. And then he says
[2:25:32.620 --> 2:25:38.220]  that I said, do you, I've got a sausage. Do you want to suck it and held out a sausage to him?
[2:25:38.220 --> 2:25:42.620]  Because I did say get them barbecue. They were back there eating it when I went back there.
[2:25:42.620 --> 2:25:46.300]  I just talked to Nico. He remembers ordering them barbecue. So I go back to the show. They're
[2:25:46.300 --> 2:25:49.740]  eating their barbecue. They're out of the room. They come back in. I get some barbecue sauce.
[2:25:49.740 --> 2:25:53.020]  I'll sit the shirt off. I was about to go back to my office and change shirts.
[2:25:54.140 --> 2:26:00.860]  So that was my stunt. And they turn it into some homoerotic thing, which I challenged
[2:26:00.860 --> 2:26:04.540]  her to speak a little guy. I think he was recording stuff to release it because if that's
[2:26:04.540 --> 2:26:11.980]  the case, then I'm starting to blip out sometimes because I literally, literally don't ever say
[2:26:11.980 --> 2:26:17.820]  stuff like that to men or women. The only jokes about that have been, do you want succulent hot
[2:26:17.820 --> 2:26:21.420]  dogs? And I'd forgotten about the Derspiegel article yesterday. I mentioned, you know,
[2:26:21.420 --> 2:26:25.500]  a pizza gate and, you know, succulent hot dogs. And I was in the other studio. He goes, oh, yeah,
[2:26:26.220 --> 2:26:31.420]  like succulent sausages. Then Jones gets up and holds out a sausage. Want to suck? He asked.
[2:26:32.380 --> 2:26:35.420]  We're guessing that it actually, how Jones eats every single meal.
[2:26:35.420 --> 2:26:41.660]  So now it's in, I mean, New York Daily News, a bunch of other public Alex Jones is very rude
[2:26:41.660 --> 2:26:46.700]  to eat with Alex Jones. Once we mend to suck his sausage, you know, again, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:53.660]  it's just shocking to me that I believe I didn't say that genuinely. But it's hard to believe
[2:26:55.020 --> 2:26:59.900]  that I would let those guys in here and then they would not be able to stand the fact
[2:26:59.900 --> 2:27:08.620]  that I archetypally took my shirt off so that I could, you know, basically throw it in their face,
[2:27:10.220 --> 2:27:15.260]  turn it into, you know, lemonade. And then it would turn, and then it's not about how I, how the
[2:27:15.260 --> 2:27:20.460]  Texan goddess barbecue was nice to us. It was all just, he comes in and he wants a big plate of food
[2:27:20.460 --> 2:27:25.660]  and he sits down there like a big pig and starts eating it and he throws sausages in our face.
[2:27:25.660 --> 2:27:29.580]  I'm going to go to break and come back and take your calls. This is a short segment, but
[2:27:30.380 --> 2:27:36.460]  it isn't even that important, but I get it. He had to do a stunt, just like I did a stunt
[2:27:39.340 --> 2:27:42.620]  to even get it picked up and it did get picked up all over.
[2:27:44.940 --> 2:27:48.940]  So see where it is. I haven't seen it. It's on TV. They're talking about it.
[2:27:48.940 --> 2:27:52.460]  Next, it'll be I sexually assaulted their Spiegel reporter, you know,
[2:27:52.460 --> 2:27:58.060]  and cameraman. I, next it'll be that I raped them both and I'm a dinosaur and a space alien and,
[2:27:58.060 --> 2:28:01.740]  you know, and I'm being sarcastic. They'll probably clip that out and say, I raped your Spiegel
[2:28:01.740 --> 2:28:06.380]  reporters. You know, they do that on the news. They have me going on. I'm anti-gay when I actually
[2:28:06.380 --> 2:28:12.540]  said I'm not anti-gay, but Colbert played the clip last week where I go, I'm anti-gay, gay frogs.
[2:28:13.100 --> 2:28:17.340]  And they say, Joseph says with gay frogs. No, I covered a report where I was covering
[2:28:17.340 --> 2:28:22.700]  the Smithsonian Institute, nature, science, where it says most of the frogs are sterile and the
[2:28:22.700 --> 2:28:29.500]  others are either asexual or homosexual. From the runoff of the water, we're drinking so bad,
[2:28:29.500 --> 2:28:34.540]  get screwed up the sexuality of mammals, you know, the Nutria rats, the
[2:28:36.940 --> 2:28:43.820]  amphibians, the fish, all of them, otters. But instead of being, you know, caring about God,
[2:28:43.820 --> 2:28:48.940]  what is in our water that's the runoffs doing this to these animals? It's just, oh, he says that
[2:28:48.940 --> 2:28:54.780]  two thirds of the frogs in Houston are gay, which I said is a joke because the article out of South
[2:28:54.780 --> 2:29:00.620]  Texas was two thirds of the frogs were sterile or asexual or had both sexual organs or didn't know
[2:29:00.620 --> 2:29:05.980]  what sex they were. So I said, see, two thirds of the frogs in Houston are gay. It was a joke
[2:29:06.540 --> 2:29:10.940]  because man, it's called Gallo's humor. I take these really sad, upsetting topics
[2:29:10.940 --> 2:29:16.300]  that I get tired of having to cover, but I got to warn people not to fear monger, so you know,
[2:29:16.300 --> 2:29:21.340]  so we do something like mom's found out. This phenol A messes up the sexuality of your kids,
[2:29:21.340 --> 2:29:26.620]  causes tumors, causes lower IQs, mom stopped buying stuff that was this phenol A marked.
[2:29:27.340 --> 2:29:29.740]  And guess what? It's hard to find this phenol A anymore.
[2:29:31.260 --> 2:29:37.100]  See, it wasn't fear mongering. It was our house is on fire. Let's put it out together.
[2:29:37.100 --> 2:29:41.980]  Let's be successful. Let's move forward. You know, I just realized I've been doing this on air
[2:29:41.980 --> 2:29:46.460]  forever. Everybody makes jokes. I do that. Trump does it. I do this hand signal. I do this one.
[2:29:46.460 --> 2:29:50.940]  It's crazy. Is there like a Vulcan mind milk? I'm not copying Trump. Is he copying me? I don't
[2:29:50.940 --> 2:30:06.940]  think so. Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower last night's
[2:30:06.940 --> 2:30:12.940]  Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance
[2:30:12.940 --> 2:30:18.460]  and lack of respect for the country right after President Trump finished his historic address
[2:30:18.460 --> 2:30:25.260]  to Congress. The usual suspects like Michael Moore appeared on television to bash Donald Trump
[2:30:25.260 --> 2:30:32.460]  this time for honoring wait for it veterans. I'm going to get an Emmy for this. Most applause
[2:30:32.460 --> 2:30:38.060]  for a dead soldier on my watch. I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[2:30:38.060 --> 2:30:44.060]  Meanwhile, other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted vulgar remarks on
[2:30:44.060 --> 2:30:50.060]  Twitter calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot proving once again
[2:30:50.060 --> 2:30:55.500]  that liberalism is truly a mental disorder. I'm Darren McBrain and you can learn more

[2:32:00.300 --> 2:32:05.420]  Today, we call it bone broth and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[2:32:05.420 --> 2:32:10.380]  before it became a loss to our modern diets, a processed junk. We are now introducing caveman
[2:32:10.380 --> 2:32:15.980]  by info wars life.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root,
[2:32:15.980 --> 2:32:22.620]  chaga mushroom and seven total primal super foods in a single great tasting formula caveman. It's
[2:32:22.620 --> 2:32:27.020]  those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior
[2:32:27.020 --> 2:32:32.140]  ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them. Everyone knew that you used all
[2:32:32.140 --> 2:32:36.460]  the parts of the animal. You use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the
[2:32:36.460 --> 2:32:42.140]  bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow
[2:32:42.140 --> 2:32:47.340]  that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from
[2:32:47.340 --> 2:32:52.220]  the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made
[2:32:52.220 --> 2:32:55.980]  us what we were and this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out caveman
[2:32:55.980 --> 2:32:59.020]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself and for life.com today.

[2:33:29.020 --> 2:33:37.980]  From the info wars.com studios it's alex jones 1980s band triumph listen a little bit of this
[2:33:37.980 --> 2:33:43.180]  music great great lyrics we're running out of time we're running out of time
[2:33:47.820 --> 2:33:49.740]  remember just a year and a half ago somebody couldn't win
[2:33:52.140 --> 2:33:54.140]  but it didn't matter the course of history was there
[2:33:54.140 --> 2:33:59.340]  don't get discouraged don't be afraid
[2:34:02.700 --> 2:34:03.660]  we'll make it through another day
[2:34:08.460 --> 2:34:12.620]  make it worth the price we pay it's how we live that defines us
[2:34:12.620 --> 2:34:27.180]  think about the magic the mystery again we're on a planet in space
[2:34:28.700 --> 2:34:33.260]  we don't know where we came from we don't know who we are they say but we do it's all there in
[2:34:33.260 --> 2:34:41.180]  your genetics in your spirit all of it the whole history of it and i just can't tell you it because
[2:34:41.180 --> 2:34:44.300]  you already know it and you know what the enemy would do if i did tell you
[2:34:48.380 --> 2:34:50.940]  we know what we have to do we've done it before
[2:34:56.540 --> 2:35:00.860]  fight the good fight every day it's that the end of the song is uh really really powerful
[2:35:02.380 --> 2:35:04.620]  i think i want to read the lyrics sometime to this song on air

[2:35:09.180 --> 2:35:16.620]  have Oprah Winfrey you know i don't know if Oprah Winfrey you know i should say this is my message
[2:35:16.620 --> 2:35:22.860]  to Oprah Winfrey i don't know if she's deceived i don't know if she is a fellow traveler with
[2:35:22.860 --> 2:35:28.780]  bella melinda gates and ted turner and david rockfeller and the globalist but she meets with
[2:35:28.780 --> 2:35:35.260]  them in secret once a year we now know for about 26 years that's what the london guardian and
[2:35:35.260 --> 2:35:39.580]  associated press and abc news reported about six seven years ago
[2:35:42.540 --> 2:35:47.340]  that they have secret meetings to plot world government and a global government strategy
[2:35:47.340 --> 2:35:50.860]  and stratagem a deceptive strategy
[2:35:53.740 --> 2:35:57.420]  to establish a world government to carry out medical
[2:35:57.420 --> 2:36:05.420]  systems medical tyranny now a book just came out two weeks ago by
[2:36:06.300 --> 2:36:11.740]  chelsea clinton rob jackson was at a bookstore and saw it global health government
[2:36:14.380 --> 2:36:16.700]  i mean the title is a governing global health
[2:36:19.100 --> 2:36:22.940]  but it was it was written for her mother to be the winner and she'd be put as the front
[2:36:22.940 --> 2:36:30.780]  a nice little girl webster hubbell's daughter hello i'm mr red a horse is a horse of course of
[2:36:30.780 --> 2:36:36.300]  course that is of course unless the horse is the famous mr red sorry not insulting what she looks
[2:36:36.300 --> 2:36:42.140]  like but me her dad looks like mr red and it's just that everything's a lie with them it's webster
[2:36:42.140 --> 2:36:50.780]  hubbell's daughter we know it oh wilbur nobody's talking about chelsea clinton's new book including
[2:36:50.780 --> 2:36:59.180]  chelsea clinton and oprah wimfrey like has this tax-free cult in africa where she teaches them
[2:36:59.180 --> 2:37:03.900]  like magical thinking and you know submitting all this and then they get sterilized i mean

[2:37:12.620 --> 2:37:18.380]  admit oprah got him in oprah boosted him oprah pushed him to the top but now they want oprah
[2:37:18.380 --> 2:37:23.420]  wimfrey to wade in a woman and she's black i think demographically that people will go for that
[2:37:23.420 --> 2:37:28.620]  we have to start exposing her now because it doesn't really matter with her billions of dollars
[2:37:29.180 --> 2:37:35.260]  whether richest entertainer in history it doesn't matter if she knows her she doesn't know
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:43.420]  is a sword conscious when it runs you through doesn't matter but oprah is a smart lady she's
[2:37:43.420 --> 2:37:52.300]  a lot of criticism she's a good manager i i i can unequivocally say i she knows what she's doing
[2:37:52.300 --> 2:37:55.820]  now now she may see overpopulation and poverty and stuff and they just better to get rid of all
[2:37:55.820 --> 2:37:59.980]  these people so it doesn't keep happening no you set up a system to empower them all because
[2:38:00.860 --> 2:38:05.580]  and some will still die but you don't sit there and just write people off while you live in a palace
[2:38:05.580 --> 2:38:18.780]  lady comprende so oprah wimfrey i've closed this for a long time is wicked and she's dangerous

[2:38:31.100 --> 2:38:39.340]  it's going to start and oprah wimfrey is coming so understand that and we've got to start hitting
[2:38:39.340 --> 2:38:46.860]  her and hitting her hard because nobody else and i'm not bragging i don't like saying nobody
[2:38:46.860 --> 2:38:50.860]  else has done the research we've done on her and what she's up to because it's like americans are so
[2:38:52.700 --> 2:38:58.700]  insular americans are so okay the lowest level of any industrialized nation of being of being
[2:38:58.700 --> 2:39:04.940]  passport holders so i love america it has great roots great possibility but we've come exceptionally
[2:39:04.940 --> 2:39:11.740]  dumb obsession exceptionally spoiled heather drudge report dot com right now yes she can

[2:39:32.140 --> 2:39:36.060]  and i could tell why she's managing another black people in there you talk about
[2:39:36.780 --> 2:39:39.980]  i mean they admitted in the news it's how to reduce the population average
[2:39:41.260 --> 2:39:44.060]  i love it man every once in a while be at a restaurant outdoors or something's happened
[2:39:44.060 --> 2:39:47.660]  twice outdoors or wherever and we're at these leftist events and see me some racist black folks
[2:39:47.660 --> 2:39:52.620]  walk by happened in dc probably happens every once in a while just in general but in dc probably
[2:39:52.620 --> 2:39:57.180]  happens sometimes exaggerates on video bunch maybe 30 times i wouldn't pay attention most of
[2:39:57.180 --> 2:40:04.700]  us like you you you white devil screw you i'd be like oh you do you like obama yeah i do
[2:40:04.700 --> 2:40:09.660]  what you want something you want to fight them like oh yeah and then they realize i've got like
[2:40:09.660 --> 2:40:14.460]  navy seals and you know special forces people with me active duty you name it and they just
[2:40:14.460 --> 2:40:20.780]  kind of back off but the point is is that i don't want to kill them i actually don't want them to
[2:40:20.780 --> 2:40:24.620]  be aborted before they're born i don't want anybody black white doesn't matter i don't want anybody
[2:40:26.540 --> 2:40:31.500]  i don't like their spoiled dumbass racist crap just like i don't like some toothless clan guy
[2:40:31.500 --> 2:40:37.260]  the dairy queen because i got a hot girlfriend you know in 1994 with six guys get down on a pickup
[2:40:37.260 --> 2:40:41.260]  threatening to kick my ass all because i'm getting a nice car got a good-looking woman on my arm
[2:40:42.220 --> 2:40:46.860]  i don't like gang members and dumbasses in groups acting tough and let me just explain
[2:40:46.860 --> 2:40:50.540]  something to all the black nationals everybody else that think the liberals and the socials
[2:40:50.540 --> 2:40:53.500]  and the globalist your friends they're the ones that tell you they love you all day because they
[2:40:53.500 --> 2:40:58.460]  want you close so they can make sure you never become anything they created gangs to rap to ruin
[2:40:58.460 --> 2:41:03.420]  your communities they ship the cocaine in so you'd use it and kill yourselves i'm the best friend
[2:41:03.420 --> 2:41:05.980]  and donald trump's the best friend you're ever gonna have
[2:41:10.140 --> 2:41:14.220]  and that's why trump has got to convince these people it's the right thing to do nothing stopping
[2:41:14.220 --> 2:41:17.340]  trump because he's on the right side of history unless he gets on the wrong side of history
[2:41:17.340 --> 2:41:22.220]  himself that's a key quote trump cannot be stopped because he's on the right side of history
[2:41:22.220 --> 2:41:26.700]  and the will of humanity the only person that can betray donald trump at this point is donald trump
[2:41:27.340 --> 2:41:33.500]  because if he lets sessions who's a great guy go on some 1950s drug war garbage that's got
[2:41:33.500 --> 2:41:39.420]  mexico already failing yeah the cops might have nice cigarette boats and fancy corvettes they
[2:41:39.420 --> 2:41:43.580]  seized but their kids aren't going to be safe at school because the society's going to be imploding
[2:41:43.580 --> 2:41:49.580]  we've got to decriminalize it to take the money out of it i'm gonna go to your phone calls but
[2:41:49.580 --> 2:41:55.340]  here's oprah whimpering and i don't like to judge people i don't like to judge people but let me
[2:41:55.340 --> 2:42:05.740]  say this she is in the house of pure unadulterated anti-human death okay she is in the highest level
[2:42:05.740 --> 2:42:12.700]  meetings that only 15 people go to and those 15 people run the cfr with 4 000 people and gave us
[2:42:12.700 --> 2:42:20.540]  with a hundred or 200 top people and hundreds of guests or builder berg with 150 she she goes into
[2:42:21.580 --> 2:42:29.740]  the star chamber meetings lord rothschild attends that's that's one of the 15 look it up

[2:43:07.100 --> 2:43:17.820]  i i actually never thought that that was i never considered the question even a possibility
[2:43:17.820 --> 2:43:25.180]  i just thought oh oh right because it's clear that you don't need government experience to be
[2:43:25.180 --> 2:43:30.700]  elected president right i thought oh gee i don't have the experience i don't know enough i don't
[2:43:30.700 --> 2:43:41.340]  know and now i'm thinking oh all right well okay building buildings in new york running over the
[2:43:41.340 --> 2:43:45.980]  mothio when you're a teenager uh having your own business all the world having top-rated shows

[2:44:27.660 --> 2:44:36.620]  she she exudes this fake confidence this narcissism and then sprays it onto the audience they all
[2:44:36.620 --> 2:44:43.180]  feel like they're weather it's a little cutesy event that big fat pyramid right in front of
[2:44:43.180 --> 2:44:51.180]  everybody letting folks know we're on top you're on bottom instead of the circle like the sun the
[2:44:51.180 --> 2:44:57.740]  circle of light the circle will become complete with you as well oprah you're on the wrong side
[2:44:57.740 --> 2:45:04.300]  of history all right covering that analyzing that bloomberg piece uh briefly we're going to
[2:45:04.300 --> 2:45:08.700]  end the special we started running last monday one of our biggest specials ever dealing with the fact
[2:45:08.700 --> 2:45:15.740]  that they announced via ad roll that we're not allowed to advertise on google because we're
[2:45:15.740 --> 2:45:20.620]  dehumanized we don't exist and so you really came through we've brought in about half the money we
[2:45:20.620 --> 2:45:26.620]  lost that was budgeted for the next year as we can project what it's going to bring in so that's
[2:45:26.620 --> 2:45:30.380]  a big victory thank you so much and with a few other specials and things down the road i hope we
[2:45:30.380 --> 2:45:35.020]  can you know bring in the rest we need i'm signing the lease today for the dc bureau and i'm going
[2:45:35.020 --> 2:45:39.340]  to start hiring a few people to help course see and then other crew and the rest of it so it's not
[2:45:39.340 --> 2:45:43.340]  like you know it's the end all be all but you know having an operation there in dc it's important
[2:45:43.340 --> 2:45:46.700]  so we're going to do it because before we didn't have a beachhead there it was just both parties
[2:45:46.700 --> 2:45:51.420]  controlled and what's the point now we're beginning to win we have to get ready to win we have to be
[2:45:51.420 --> 2:45:56.380]  ready to take action and not just sit here and stay where we're at it's its destiny it must be done
[2:45:57.500 --> 2:46:00.380]  and i've told you every step of the way we're going to the next level we're on the next level
[2:46:00.380 --> 2:46:03.100]  we're on the next level and we always do it and we're going to elect a president we're going to
[2:46:03.100 --> 2:46:07.340]  reverse napton get and tpp and we're going to cut the taxes we're going to turn the cold power
[2:46:07.340 --> 2:46:12.380]  plants back on and it's all happening and they're howling in anger oh really you thought you were
[2:46:12.380 --> 2:46:18.060]  the only ones that could fight you told us you were the boss and that you were invincible and then
[2:46:18.060 --> 2:46:22.780]  you were the only people in the world that counted well guess what that's not the way it works i learned
[2:46:22.780 --> 2:46:30.460]  that when i was very very young what some bully thinks they're gonna because they're 15 and you're
[2:46:31.020 --> 2:46:36.060]  12 because they weigh 60 pounds more than you they're gonna jump on top of you and beat you up for no
[2:46:36.060 --> 2:46:43.180]  reason when you're walking home from school bus you know they do it once when you're 11 now you're
[2:46:43.180 --> 2:46:48.940]  12 you've been in a few fights they take a swing you jump on top of them ram their head in the
[2:46:48.940 --> 2:47:00.620]  concrete knock them out and then the police come neighbor ladies sit there on a porch says i saw
[2:47:00.620 --> 2:47:07.420]  that big big boy attack that one well that's just the way it is and see that's how it is you think
[2:47:07.420 --> 2:47:11.100]  you're going to climb up on top of us we're going to kick your ass up and down the street just get
[2:47:11.100 --> 2:47:19.340]  ready for it and by the way culturally politically we're not 12 anymore and the enemy knows that we're
[2:47:19.340 --> 2:47:29.580]  like a 800 pound wrecking machine and the globalist of the humanity ever fully awakens aren't like a
[2:47:29.580 --> 2:47:37.340]  75 pound scarecrow starving vampire that can hardly get out of its wheelchair
[2:47:39.340 --> 2:47:43.180]  and that's what's so frustrating when we defeat these people and humanity goes the next level
[2:47:43.180 --> 2:47:47.100]  we're going to look back on this and ask that's what you know in revelation i forget the passage
[2:47:48.300 --> 2:47:51.100]  can you guys look it up and we go to the calls i'm going to i'm going to take calls in the next
[2:47:51.100 --> 2:47:55.420]  hour with uh the day but not a little bit i'll do 20 months with them and take calls but i'm
[2:47:55.420 --> 2:48:01.500]  going to call us here in the next segment imagine somewhere in the bible i forget all the passages
[2:48:01.500 --> 2:48:05.260]  but but like the devil is locked up for a thousand years for everybody to look at him
[2:48:06.380 --> 2:48:11.180]  and people come and they say that's who did this that too conquer this that you did all these horrible
[2:48:11.180 --> 2:48:16.700]  things so google what passages is it where everybody marvels the devil's locked up in a cage and they
[2:48:16.700 --> 2:48:31.900]  say this is who did all that satan bound and then i saw thrones and then sat on the judgment was
[2:48:31.900 --> 2:48:36.780]  committed to them and i saw the souls of those that didn't be headed for their witness to jesus
[2:48:37.340 --> 2:48:44.380]  the word of god would worship the beast or his image and not received as mark on their foreheads
[2:48:44.380 --> 2:48:48.460]  or on their hands and they that lived and reigned with christ for a thousand years those that didn't
[2:48:48.460 --> 2:48:53.100]  take the digital system those that ran to the hills under the one world government system
[2:48:53.100 --> 2:48:58.300]  but the rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years was finished this is the first
[2:48:58.300 --> 2:49:04.700]  resurrection where's the part where the devils bound satanic rebellion crushed see if you can
[2:49:04.700 --> 2:49:08.780]  look in there i'm gonna find that part where they're pointing in the cage saying this is what did this
[2:49:08.780 --> 2:49:15.260]  this is a joke whether you believe that physically is coming or an art type of at the point is
[2:49:15.260 --> 2:49:19.260]  buying or selling out of this control system and who thought this up two thousand years ago
[2:49:19.260 --> 2:49:25.020]  what was john the revelator taking on the isle of patmos was he looking into the future

[2:55:41.580 --> 2:55:46.460]  leave want to play the end of his speech where he brings in providence and god again and how they
[2:55:46.460 --> 2:55:50.220]  could demonize that beautiful moment where he's honoring the widow of the lost navy sea only him
[2:55:50.220 --> 2:55:54.620]  and raid and call her stupid and call her scum it's just it's just horrible

[2:56:16.220 --> 2:56:20.380]  he's trying to cut taxes for poor and working people he's trying to get loans at zero percent
[2:56:20.380 --> 2:56:24.220]  interest or close from the federal reserve of the people and that's why the elite hating

[3:01:02.300 --> 3:01:07.260]  year that's budgeted for this year when google had his band off ad roll that's devastating that was
[3:01:07.260 --> 3:01:13.020]  it just so happened to be just about the we had 3.4 million last year to budget into this year
[3:01:13.020 --> 3:01:19.580]  that sounds like a lot running the media operation that's nothing folks okay and you know they took
[3:01:19.580 --> 3:01:24.700]  it away so i got on air and freaked out half that that we lost has come in thank you listeners
[3:01:24.700 --> 3:01:30.460]  thank you viewers amazing thank you now they're gonna they're hitting this was some other stuff too

[3:01:44.380 --> 3:01:48.860]  tell us what you got coming up today alex we're gonna talk about the e you know you're just talking
[3:01:48.860 --> 3:01:54.540]  to ted mallick earlier and we've got the e you president saying stop bashing the e you he's talking
[3:01:54.540 --> 3:02:00.380]  to other uh presidents and leaders of european countries he said we can't control this we're
[3:02:00.380 --> 3:02:05.660]  seeing the same thing from uber's ceo he just had a confrontation with a driver who said you're
[3:02:05.660 --> 3:02:11.260]  killing me i'm going bankrupt you've cut our prices by uh 90 percent in terms of what we're
[3:02:11.260 --> 3:02:15.180]  writing the guy says hey it's not my fault you're a loser that's the same thing we're hearing from
[3:02:15.180 --> 3:02:20.380]  the e you that's right i'm gonna follow economies don't build them for humans say robots are coming
[3:02:20.380 --> 3:02:26.140]  in and then when you want a job you're a loser no son of a bitch you claim you own us all we're
[3:02:26.140 --> 3:02:31.660]  animals in a zoo then build a habitat that's nice if you're such a god no you say you want us to die
[3:02:31.660 --> 3:02:37.020]  well let me explain how that works you're not going to run to koai or tasmania you want us to
[3:02:37.020 --> 3:02:42.620]  die you're going to get killed in the process dumbass go ahead absolutely alex and you know we
[3:02:42.620 --> 3:02:47.660]  talked about tpp and it was something that al that uh donald trump mentioned last night
[3:02:47.660 --> 3:02:51.900]  in his speech is something that he didn't get as much recognition for that i think he needs to
[3:02:51.900 --> 3:02:56.860]  that was a key thing and of course moving forward the e you is a key issue as well but i also want
[3:02:56.860 --> 3:03:01.180]  to talk about this border tax adjustment that i mentioned to you briefly yesterday it wasn't
[3:03:01.180 --> 3:03:04.860]  the kind of thing that donald trump talked about in the speech last night he didn't get involved
[3:03:04.860 --> 3:03:08.540]  in a lot of details but it's something that's going to be coming up in the next couple weeks
[3:03:08.540 --> 3:03:13.100]  we need to get behind ted malik we need to get behind absolutely don't work we are actually
[3:03:13.100 --> 3:03:17.500]  defeating them we're winning and all the idiots that say i've sold out yeah i sold out to beating
[3:03:17.500 --> 3:03:22.860]  tpp and beating open borders and and defeating obama care and defeating the globalist and teaching
[3:03:22.860 --> 3:03:28.460]  five-year-olds how to have sex with trannies damn right i sold out to jesus christ a long time ago
[3:03:28.460 --> 3:03:34.380]  let's go back to salvatore go ahead and make your point absolutely i mean i i came i mean just to
[3:03:34.380 --> 3:03:39.900]  make a quick point i came to this country when i was around 10 or 12 uh you know i was thought that
[3:03:39.900 --> 3:03:44.780]  you know we went to a naturalization process the legal process that was a long process by the way
[3:03:45.660 --> 3:03:51.020]  and um by the way my dad and i agree for good people that work hard or have skills it should
[3:03:51.020 --> 3:03:55.740]  be made easier they make it hard to push you under the water so they can have a permanent
[3:03:55.740 --> 3:04:01.420]  underclass they feed on go ahead yeah absolutely but one key thing that my dad said is you're gonna
[3:04:01.420 --> 3:04:06.540]  simulate to the american style it's a funny thing right i mean you're gonna actually assimilate
[3:04:06.540 --> 3:04:10.780]  you're actually gonna learn english and you're actually gonna i mean not do the same things
[3:04:10.780 --> 3:04:16.860]  that we do in mexico it's just it's key well if i moved to mexico i'd go native i'd do what they
[3:04:16.860 --> 3:04:20.860]  did i mean that's the whole point exactly why people used to want to come to america to get away
[3:04:20.860 --> 3:04:25.820]  from the class society to you know to get away from centralization to get away from if you weren't
[3:04:25.820 --> 3:04:30.700]  in the right group you can't set up a business that's why america was so great but under globalism
[3:04:30.700 --> 3:04:36.300]  notice it goes back to feudalism doesn't it sell the door yeah absolutely look at the way look at
[3:04:36.300 --> 3:04:41.580]  all the potential the mixers that have the oil fan makes and all that everything they cannot tap into
[3:04:41.580 --> 3:04:46.220]  that because there's there's the art the culture and i'm not just saying that the patronizing
[3:04:46.220 --> 3:04:51.900]  i like mexican food i like mexican movies mexican art that's what's in my house i love mexican
[3:04:51.900 --> 3:04:58.300]  culture that's produced by the mexican thinkers i don't like the mexican slaves we'll be right back
[3:05:01.500 --> 3:05:07.020]  just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower last night's trump
[3:05:07.020 --> 3:05:12.940]  speech to congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and
[3:05:12.940 --> 3:05:18.460]  lack of respect for the country right after president trump finished his historic address to
[3:05:18.460 --> 3:05:25.100]  congress the usual suspects like michael moore appeared on television to bash donald trump
[3:05:25.100 --> 3:05:32.540]  this time for honoring wait for it veterans i'm gonna get an Emmy for this most applause for a
[3:05:32.540 --> 3:05:39.500]  dead soldier on my watch i mean this is the the sickness of this man meanwhile other liberals like
[3:05:39.500 --> 3:05:45.900]  hillary clinton volunteered dan grillo posted vulgar remarks on twitter calling the widow honored
[3:05:45.900 --> 3:05:53.500]  during trump's speech an idiot proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder i'm

[3:08:46.140 --> 3:08:52.460]  that's burn the face sucker off of our culture not burned down america not burned down europe not
[3:08:52.460 --> 3:08:59.020]  burned down mexico not burned down china but kick authoritarians like the kindness chinese out remove
[3:08:59.020 --> 3:09:04.940]  them that starts with trump saying you know what taiwan's were the nationalists and the real government
[3:09:04.940 --> 3:09:09.260]  ran no we're gonna follow our defense pack with taiwan i want to get to david night he's got a
[3:09:09.260 --> 3:09:15.420]  bunch of clips from the speech last night that was so good i don't want to sound like i'm fawning
[3:09:15.420 --> 3:09:18.860]  you know my gut told me trump was good i was supporting him long before we got contacted
[3:09:19.420 --> 3:09:20.860]  by roger stone about having him on
[3:09:23.900 --> 3:09:29.020]  and i and i don't want to say i'm guilty because i look for reasons to get mad at trump and there's
[3:09:29.020 --> 3:09:35.340]  just so few and far between and he's so polar opposite of hillary and the globalists that
[3:09:35.340 --> 3:09:38.300]  i'm gonna take four or five phone calls i'm gonna let david take over but briefly i'm going to
[3:09:38.300 --> 3:09:41.420]  david right now and then i'm gonna come back to you in about five minutes but i'm gonna take these
[3:09:41.420 --> 3:09:46.940]  calls i know that you for the first year of my support still didn't like trump you didn't know
[3:09:46.940 --> 3:09:52.140]  it was a big field of people still done like eight or so from like you know 16 just you know this
[3:09:52.140 --> 3:09:56.060]  campaign started a year and a half before the election and again i don't tell you what to think
[3:09:56.060 --> 3:10:00.540]  i don't tell you what to do i encourage everybody you know whoever they were you know i told people
[3:10:00.540 --> 3:10:03.580]  i said if you want to you know find something about trump you don't like go ahead i was like
[3:10:03.580 --> 3:10:07.420]  really you find something really bad there because the new world order is genuinely mad this isn't
[3:10:07.420 --> 3:10:12.460]  fake and you know the word i've got is you know that uh he's asleep herself in the liberty movement
[3:10:12.460 --> 3:10:19.500]  now though it's so good it's so modified it's already having such devastating effects to globalist
[3:10:19.500 --> 3:10:24.060]  everywhere that it's like we're already halfway through the antibiotics and the sore throat's
[3:10:24.060 --> 3:10:29.020]  gone we know that this antibiotic donald trump works on the new world order we got half the bottle
[3:10:29.020 --> 3:10:35.500]  to go doesn't mean the antibiotics perfect but it's working it's real uh now i'm almost like in awe
[3:10:36.140 --> 3:10:42.540]  that our beachhead is already expanding poland's pulling out lapin's winning gert wilders is winning
[3:10:42.540 --> 3:10:46.300]  they're in full retreat and i think are they gonna start a war set a nuke off because these people
[3:10:46.300 --> 3:10:52.060]  never give up and that's why i'm not somebody looking for authoritarianism they're the ones
[3:10:52.060 --> 3:10:56.460]  pushing authoritarianism and killing trump and bullying us and ending free press and
[3:10:56.460 --> 3:11:00.860]  shutting off our advertising i don't look for fights but we're already we're already under
[3:11:00.860 --> 3:11:07.660]  physical and corporate attack this is sedition being organized by foreign powers i first off
[3:11:07.660 --> 3:11:13.020]  your transformation into trump supporter now where are you david and then expanding from there
[3:11:13.020 --> 3:11:22.700]  i just feel like we shouldn't be bullied into not having uh let's say political force
[3:11:23.260 --> 3:11:27.740]  movements at least on the leaders of these people that have openly been in sedition criminal
[3:11:27.740 --> 3:11:33.020]  fomenting criminal architecture clear criminal operations that are in the wiki leagues just as
[3:11:33.020 --> 3:11:36.940]  says even though nobody else will say this because we know they're a cornered rat i'll say it that
[3:11:36.940 --> 3:11:40.940]  hillary needs to be indicted george soros i mean they hate me they they have their own publications
[3:11:40.940 --> 3:11:45.740]  let's just say i'm not bragging but they attack me as much as trump and the actual enemy publications
[3:11:45.740 --> 3:11:50.220]  like media matters and they're trying to formulate all sorts of stuff to bring us down then i'll talk
[3:11:50.220 --> 3:11:56.940]  about soon i mean if they want to fight they better believe they've got one and so what is the movement
[3:11:56.940 --> 3:12:00.140]  towards that that i'm going to cause and we'll skip this break so you have more time but callers i
[3:12:00.140 --> 3:12:04.380]  promise janine and tim and don and jordan hayden i'm coming to you and then that's it but but i mean
[3:12:04.380 --> 3:12:09.180]  david just just a quick two minute response we know alex uh like you said i was reluctant to do it
[3:12:09.180 --> 3:12:13.820]  because i i'm very cynical about politicians and even though donald trump was saying some
[3:12:13.820 --> 3:12:18.140]  things that i agreed with he also said some things i disagreed with and i didn't really trust him on
[3:12:18.140 --> 3:12:22.940]  the issues of fighting globalism talking about the border talking about trade and other issues
[3:12:22.940 --> 3:12:29.420]  like that at one point i realized hey he was running ads 20 30 years ago at his own expense
[3:12:29.420 --> 3:12:33.420]  in the new york times when he wasn't running for office so this guy is genuine on this stuff and
[3:12:33.420 --> 3:12:38.620]  he is genuine i've seen it now and we've seen him pull back tpp i never thought we would get this
[3:12:38.620 --> 3:12:44.540]  killed it we yeah he killed it he didn't take control of it executively which was the globalist
[3:12:44.540 --> 3:12:49.340]  had done he didn't take that undue power he destroyed that power and turned it back to the states
[3:12:49.340 --> 3:12:53.420]  that's right he didn't just try to adjust it around the edges or become the king himself
[3:12:53.420 --> 3:12:58.300]  he killed that and he did what george washington did when they said we want a third term or be king
[3:12:58.300 --> 3:13:03.340]  he went back to his farm that's what i'm saying it's legend that's right here's the issue what we
[3:13:03.340 --> 3:13:07.740]  have to do and people who disagree with them on some liberty issues i disagree with the fact
[3:13:07.740 --> 3:13:11.820]  that he thinks he can still win the war on drugs i don't think it can be ridiculous but yeah but but
[3:13:11.820 --> 3:13:16.460]  we have to understand that as i've said over and over again we have to see that the fight for liberty
[3:13:16.460 --> 3:13:20.380]  is going to be won at the local level if we really want it we're going to have and he's trying to
[3:13:20.380 --> 3:13:27.260]  devolve power back to the people that's right if we we've got to stop this consolidation of power
[3:13:27.260 --> 3:13:31.340]  from the local level to the national you heard he's already going after the epa where they say you
[3:13:31.340 --> 3:13:35.340]  can't build something there's a pond in your backyard that's right that's right and so his
[3:13:35.340 --> 3:13:39.740]  move against the epa and i think it's brilliant what he and banner are doing saying we're going
[3:13:39.740 --> 3:13:44.300]  to increase defense spending by 10 but we're going to cut these agencies that have been predatory in
[3:13:44.300 --> 3:13:48.940]  the united states like the epa like the state department which is not making us safer it's
[3:13:48.940 --> 3:13:54.540]  making us the world more dangerous with its failure let's be clear let's be clear they admit in their
[3:13:54.540 --> 3:13:58.460]  public statements the epa is meant to shut our industry down so the globalists can put it in
[3:13:58.460 --> 3:14:03.900]  countries with no controls it's meant as internal tariffs on us to make sure we're deindustrialized
[3:14:03.900 --> 3:14:08.940]  that's the admitted plan and the globalists are so arrogant they admitted the plan the plan's out
[3:14:08.940 --> 3:14:14.860]  the people've got it their arrogance is they're undoing and when their own top people you know
[3:14:14.860 --> 3:14:19.500]  like mallet come out now in the last decade and blow them wide open and comes on my show
[3:14:19.500 --> 3:14:26.300]  he headed up davos and he headed up aspen that is a huge victory you know that the mission of the
[3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:32.300]  epa is not clean air clean water the mission of the epa is now climate change and it has to be
[3:14:32.300 --> 3:14:38.060]  opposed because climate change is the problem global government is the solution that remember
[3:14:38.060 --> 3:14:42.700]  just a few years ago was warming we proved that a fraud now they say we disagree with change no we
[3:14:42.700 --> 3:14:47.900]  know change always happens that's right so we have to we have to understand that is just as key as
[3:14:47.900 --> 3:14:53.420]  one of the other three legs of this globalism moving forward the trans-pacific partnership
[3:14:53.420 --> 3:14:59.900]  was a key thing to stop but also climate change is very key to stop that and the epa as i point out
[3:14:59.900 --> 3:15:05.820]  climate change is what they have become about and they're using illegal unconstitutional methods to
[3:15:05.820 --> 3:15:10.700]  do this and that's what general providence because i'm going to shut down is that over reach from
[3:15:10.700 --> 3:15:13.660]  the bureaucracy that's right all right david i'm going to run through these calls skip the
[3:15:13.660 --> 3:15:17.180]  sprays you have more time and i read these calls they were holding and i appreciate them doing that

[3:15:34.860 --> 3:15:40.300]  just love to watch donald trump and i think he's a really good speaker but my wife went to bed last
[3:15:40.300 --> 3:15:45.580]  night i turned on listening to trump i had to turn it off because i couldn't stand that little rat
[3:15:45.580 --> 3:15:52.220]  paul ryan back in the back oh it's his yeah let's show trump's speech the body language the fakeness
[3:15:52.220 --> 3:15:56.300]  if i had somebody who's a dinner guest over and they acted like that i'd say never invite that person
[3:15:56.300 --> 3:16:02.380]  back again but not just his looks or my instinct his action good rhetoric but but always working for
[3:16:02.380 --> 3:16:08.460]  the globalist getting money from soros please elaborate what was that like well he's a you
[3:16:08.460 --> 3:16:14.220]  know he's the biggest obstructionist that trump has and he just looked to me like he was a monkey
[3:16:15.180 --> 3:16:19.740]  hanging by a string and every time he wanted to uh bring attention to himself he would stand up and
[3:16:19.740 --> 3:16:24.460]  clap and i just had to turn it off i couldn't watch it anymore it just it was just no i agree
[3:16:24.460 --> 3:16:28.460]  uh paul ryan ruined the speech for me and i was i pretty much said that last night but i didn't
[3:16:28.460 --> 3:16:34.540]  want to be a killjoy um you know look he is he's like every other psychopath you ever run into
[3:16:34.540 --> 3:16:41.500]  he thinks he's invincible he's in his own world he has no empathy and he is just he is the biggest
[3:16:41.500 --> 3:16:46.220]  jerk i mean he really is he is the he is the biggest enemy of this country let me tell you
[3:16:46.220 --> 3:16:50.300]  something close he doesn't know what planet she's on maxine waters doesn't know what planet she's on
[3:16:50.300 --> 3:16:53.980]  you know the other democratic leadership things islands float i mean they were picked because
[3:16:53.980 --> 3:16:59.340]  they're idiots okay the republicans have kind of been the slimmers behind the scenes derailing
[3:16:59.340 --> 3:17:04.620]  the liberty movement forever and he's one of the last people that genrich put in through that chain
[3:17:04.620 --> 3:17:10.700]  for the through baner and they're all compromised and he kept looking at trump like i'm gonna defeat
[3:17:10.700 --> 3:17:15.340]  him i'm better than him this type of twisted psychopath is like a super alpha male but isn't
[3:17:15.340 --> 3:17:21.420]  an alpha and he looks at a real alpha male like trump and he can't standing please elaborate go
[3:17:21.420 --> 3:17:26.380]  ahead call him good dog well i i just you know i just couldn't watch i had to turn it off i mean
[3:17:26.380 --> 3:17:32.060]  we all know he's the biggest obstructionist that uh that trump has uh obama care he's trying to stall
[3:17:32.060 --> 3:17:36.460]  tax cuts he's trying to stall which main economists say if we don't get him quick we're going into a
[3:17:36.460 --> 3:17:43.020]  freaking depression and so if it happens he's the number one enemy just remember that right i just
[3:17:43.020 --> 3:17:49.180]  have one more comment alex uh i have a new name for oprah winfrey i call her oprah winbag because
[3:17:49.180 --> 3:17:56.220]  she's just the biggest piece of crap they really are she's worth billions of dollars those
[3:17:56.220 --> 3:17:59.900]  things africans can have air conditioning david anytime you want pop in i've got three or four
[3:17:59.900 --> 3:18:03.580]  more calls to take but i mean your quick take i can tell your childhood a bit about paul ryan i mean
[3:18:03.580 --> 3:18:08.300]  give me a break yeah you know alex i you know how many times i've talked about paul ryan i called
[3:18:08.300 --> 3:18:14.620]  him paul ryan o because he is republican in name only i was really surprised though and here's one
[3:18:14.620 --> 3:18:20.620]  thing this this border-adjusted tax that was being pushed by the house at first i don't agree ryan
[3:18:20.620 --> 3:18:24.700]  it's kind of tacitly is supporting something good you're gonna tell us you're gonna tell us at the
[3:18:24.700 --> 3:18:28.620]  bottom of the hour about that but this is a this is a good plan and i agree with you and you know
[3:18:28.620 --> 3:18:34.540]  when we look at situations look at we had robert kennedy jr who came out he disagrees with trump
[3:18:34.540 --> 3:18:40.380]  on everything but he's honest enough to say hey on vaccines and you know mercury in the vaccines
[3:18:40.380 --> 3:18:44.380]  and on what pharmaceuticals are doing to people i'm with you i'll work with you on that one issue
[3:18:44.380 --> 3:18:48.780]  where i agree with you we need to be adult enough that is something no i totally agree that's right
[3:18:48.780 --> 3:18:52.860]  we need to back them yeah most democrats don't give me the willies okay most republicans don't
[3:18:52.860 --> 3:18:57.420]  like you i feel confident i'm around you have no anxiety i feel like i you know i could leave you
[3:18:57.420 --> 3:19:01.260]  you know you know with my you know you know kids for a year and they'd be great when i came back
[3:19:01.260 --> 3:19:05.340]  with ryan i get the heebie jeebies yes yes absolutely and i get the heebie jeebies with
[3:19:05.340 --> 3:19:11.020]  hillary i get him with him so my my gut gives me the heebie jeebies do you get the heebie jeebies
[3:19:11.020 --> 3:19:16.060]  oh yeah absolutely he looks like eddie munster and we've had him lie to us over and over again
[3:19:16.060 --> 3:19:19.260]  remember he was going to get rid of obama care they were going to do something about he tried to
[3:19:19.260 --> 3:19:24.060]  block trump's denomination yes yes absolutely i mean he's just look i'm sorry presidential
[3:19:24.060 --> 3:19:28.460]  aspirations he ran for vice president just four years ago so clearly this guy has you know the
[3:19:28.460 --> 3:19:34.220]  speaker should be it needs to be walter jones who's got total intent it doesn't need to be some
[3:19:34.220 --> 3:19:39.740]  power grasping pretty boy all right thank you uh collard thank you so much uh up next is janine

[3:20:13.980 --> 3:20:18.940]  what they are but i know they're picked up that the mainstream media was your enemy well and i used
[3:20:18.940 --> 3:20:24.140]  to tell my mom why can't you see it why don't you you know why don't you see this and you know it took
[3:20:24.140 --> 3:20:28.540]  me a long time i ended up having a family and this and that but it took me a long time and and the
[3:20:28.540 --> 3:20:34.060]  books that you talk about people can get them they can read it and find all the same stuff that you
[3:20:34.060 --> 3:20:39.980]  you you know i mean you you obviously know a lot more because you've dedicated your life to doing it
[3:20:39.980 --> 3:20:45.900]  and i'm so thankful you're like the executive watchman who call enough about me you're awesome
[3:20:45.900 --> 3:20:50.140]  now what's what's your take on the speech last night you are too i know one i would just want to
[3:20:50.140 --> 3:20:57.340]  say you know when i you play the music uh mic and the mechanics you know uh and you were playing
[3:20:57.340 --> 3:21:04.220]  triumphant i didn't think anybody else on this earth knew about him you know i love your music it connects
[3:21:04.220 --> 3:21:08.620]  you connect and you're you said you're you know you're doing the same hand language as trump and
[3:21:08.620 --> 3:21:13.500]  it's like like mines you know you guys i noticed the media was pointing that out and people said look
[3:21:14.140 --> 3:21:18.860]  who's copying who and i realized i've always done thumbs up everybody says stop doing it in family
[3:21:18.860 --> 3:21:23.340]  photos and then i also kind of do the same it's like a gun it's kind of like you know it's kind of
[3:21:23.340 --> 3:21:30.380]  like this a poetic unfolding of a life beautifully directed by barry jinkins as some tv show just
[3:21:30.380 --> 3:21:34.620]  popped on i guess something just popped on a video i got all these studios it's all crazy anyways and
[3:21:34.620 --> 3:21:37.260]  like this but everybody does that he's like hey we're you know we're getting it done everything's
[3:21:37.260 --> 3:21:41.660]  okay they claim that's a luminati or whatever these are just natural hand signs i've ever done
[3:21:41.660 --> 3:21:47.340]  i have good will towards people so you know if you know if doing hand signs like that is a
[3:21:47.340 --> 3:21:54.460]  luminati then i guess i am but i'm not but i'm sorry man go ahead true you're the truth anybody
[3:21:54.460 --> 3:21:58.700]  who has the courage to get up there and tell the things that you do and i and i feel sorry we're
[3:21:58.700 --> 3:22:02.380]  blowing up the globalist control the individual that they look they're all about control we're not
[3:22:02.380 --> 3:22:07.100]  but enough about me what do you think of trump's speech i loved it i watched every bit of it and i
[3:22:07.100 --> 3:22:14.060]  and i liked the last caller who don and pa he's right paul ryan is a he's uh everything you guys
[3:22:14.060 --> 3:22:19.420]  have said how you know it looks but it's hard it was amazing god bless you jenny good to hear
[3:22:19.420 --> 3:22:22.940]  from you i appreciate you calling in a few more calls i'm turning this over to david night who's
[3:22:22.940 --> 3:22:29.980]  been holding the longest here tim in illinois you're on the air sir go ahead hey alex can you hear me
[3:22:29.980 --> 3:22:37.020]  yes i can my friend hey i'll tell you what last night's speech was awesome could you feel that
[3:22:37.020 --> 3:22:43.020]  spirit that came through from trump last night well i'll say this i didn't know how to put it
[3:22:43.020 --> 3:22:46.300]  and i thought about it for like an hour this morning and i just dropped it mentally because i
[3:22:46.300 --> 3:22:53.980]  couldn't get the right term i tried earlier as he passes each test he's given more discernment
[3:22:54.540 --> 3:23:00.700]  and gets even stronger and spiritually there's like an aura now and when he walked in there
[3:23:00.700 --> 3:23:05.020]  and the lighting's not even that good in the capital building i've been in there he was glowing
[3:23:05.020 --> 3:23:09.420]  and he looked like 10 15 years younger separately other crew were like god trump was like he lost
[3:23:09.420 --> 3:23:15.500]  20 pounds and looks like he's electric and he looked so good and then it was so powerful never
[3:23:15.500 --> 3:23:21.820]  made one mistake i mean nobody can do that in an hour and 20 minutes speech i mean it's just he is
[3:23:23.180 --> 3:23:27.820]  overtaken by it and you know that the media never quotes me they always want to know what
[3:23:27.820 --> 3:23:31.260]  does trump talk about you know with you in private conversations and i'll tell the media and they
[3:23:31.260 --> 3:23:38.460]  never say it but trump talks about the strong spirit of america god how we've got to protect
[3:23:38.460 --> 3:23:43.900]  christianity and how you know just keep believing keep working hard i'm going to deliver i'm going
[3:23:43.900 --> 3:23:48.300]  to do it uh you know i think you're going to be you know you're really impressed if we says everybody
[3:23:48.300 --> 3:23:54.460]  because i'm going i know we're going to win and the spirit you know is strong and the and it's
[3:23:54.460 --> 3:24:00.540]  literally religious and it's it's it and then you see it compared to them policy like some spoiled
[3:24:00.540 --> 3:24:05.580]  demon then we show video that for tv viewers just all mad angry won't stand up you know even when
[3:24:05.580 --> 3:24:10.060]  i'm a veterans you name it it's so clear cut talk about the spirit you saw the spirit you felt
[3:24:11.900 --> 3:24:18.060]  well i uh watched it last night i've listened to a lot of different presidents and uh
[3:24:20.540 --> 3:24:28.940]  i actually uh teared up just listened to him last night i uh i realized what he's got a head of it
[3:24:28.940 --> 3:24:35.980]  and uh he's about like a lighthouse sitting on the side of a hill and there's ships out there
[3:24:36.780 --> 3:24:42.060]  trying to come in and he's trying to keep that light on for him in that storm but
[3:24:44.460 --> 3:24:50.540]  he's he's got a lot against him he's got a lot against him well the hate they have for him is
[3:24:50.540 --> 3:24:56.540]  the hate they have a free people from brazil to russia to turkey to mexico to the united states
[3:24:56.540 --> 3:25:01.900]  they hate free independent people they hate powerful diverse people want their own destinies
[3:25:01.900 --> 3:25:07.260]  because they want monopolies and that's the best analogy yet trump is a big lighthouse
[3:25:07.260 --> 3:25:12.140]  during a hurricane with the ships trying to get in and they're trying to shut that flame down
[3:25:12.140 --> 3:25:16.860]  so they're shooting every weapon they've got trying to blow that lighthouse up uh but trump's
[3:25:16.860 --> 3:25:22.620]  just honored to be in this position and that's why he's so hard to beat uh is that but i just see
[3:25:22.620 --> 3:25:26.620]  the people that hate him that aren't part of the system who actually believe what they're doing and
[3:25:26.620 --> 3:25:32.620]  they're so sad because they don't know every policy he's involved in is trying to empower the little
[3:25:32.620 --> 3:25:37.180]  person and trying to really give them a straight shot so that's something i have trouble dealing with
[3:25:37.180 --> 3:25:45.260]  tim well and then one more thing alex uh watching them democrats last night broke my heart
[3:25:45.260 --> 3:25:53.980]  how how could people sell out their country like that well you you said the key word you said the
[3:25:53.980 --> 3:26:00.220]  key word now we continue to him hard you've got a heart you've got a conscience you've got empathy
[3:26:01.100 --> 3:26:05.820]  see they don't have that a lot of they're a bunch of selfish dirtbags who are on power trips
[3:26:06.380 --> 3:26:11.580]  they're not humble and and anybody that's got a view of the world has any real consciousness
[3:26:11.580 --> 3:26:16.300]  is humble because you realize how big the universe is you feel god's spirit it makes you feel humble
[3:26:16.300 --> 3:26:20.460]  they don't they're not in god's spirit so the reason you've you said it all perfectly better
[3:26:20.460 --> 3:26:27.340]  you better than i could ever say it it made you sad it hurt your heart because you have a heart to
[3:26:27.340 --> 3:26:33.180]  see their fallen state made it hurt your heart and they're so fallen they want to bring us down
[3:26:33.180 --> 3:26:42.380]  so they have company go ahead and say more i'm about an hour from where ryan lived here in the
[3:26:42.380 --> 3:26:53.660]  heart lane and it's a disgrace what them people said about her i uh it breaks i mean it breaks
[3:26:53.660 --> 3:27:04.540]  my heart i it seconds me that people in the country uh are so zero empathy you know there's zero
[3:27:04.540 --> 3:27:10.700]  empathy you know you're talking about mrs owens who lost her husband william ryan the nastiness
[3:27:10.700 --> 3:27:15.740]  the demonization the attacks of something so pure and wholesome again they hate that humanity
[3:27:15.740 --> 3:27:21.420]  because they don't have that strength of the sacrifice alex can i comment on that yes david
[3:27:21.420 --> 3:27:26.380]  place you know when i i saw this speech last night my my first impression was i didn't like it as
[3:27:26.380 --> 3:27:32.620]  much as the inauguration speech because of the inauguration speech he came out with a confrontational
[3:27:32.620 --> 3:27:36.460]  agenda and i was hoping that last night it was going to be more the same and he's going to say
[3:27:36.460 --> 3:27:39.740]  and these are the programs and here's the details what we're going to do but it was really more of
[3:27:39.740 --> 3:27:45.340]  a conciliatory speech and at first i thought oh look at the democrats saying please stop obstructing
[3:27:45.340 --> 3:27:50.620]  progress i really want to help you he doesn't want to dominate him he wants him to stop being evil
[3:27:50.620 --> 3:27:55.420]  that's right and and as the caller pointed it out when you see the democrats sat there when
[3:27:55.420 --> 3:27:59.820]  donald when he would look at him he looked at him like he felt sorry for him but it was genuine
[3:27:59.820 --> 3:28:04.460]  exact i'm sorry go ahead david yeah when he says let's work together for the good of the country
[3:28:04.460 --> 3:28:08.060]  and they would sneer at him they would sit on their hands they would not applaud that stuff
[3:28:08.060 --> 3:28:13.260]  as you point out when he talked about the uh fallen seals wife how they wouldn't applaud for that
[3:28:13.260 --> 3:28:17.660]  and then when he talked about how he's going to set up a program to help people who are victims
[3:28:17.660 --> 3:28:23.500]  of violent crime committed by illegal immigrants he was booed and it's like wow these people are
[3:28:23.500 --> 3:28:28.620]  showing themselves to be the enemy of the american people he is showing himself to try come on let's
[3:28:28.620 --> 3:28:33.180]  get together let's work for the american people and they hate that and it was brilliant to do that
[3:28:33.180 --> 3:28:36.860]  that's why he's president's why i'm not president because i would have come out there with a policy
[3:28:36.860 --> 3:28:41.180]  wonk speech and say we're gonna do this this and this but he worked at it at a much higher level
[3:28:41.180 --> 3:28:46.460]  in terms of showing where they were yeah i've never seen anything like this and and i'm gonna say
[3:28:46.460 --> 3:28:52.540]  this in closing god always gives a chance like like jonah and then of a for a reprieve before
[3:28:52.540 --> 3:28:57.100]  really bad stuff or israel would get warnings trumps that warning that there's no doubt he's
[3:28:57.100 --> 3:29:01.020]  the real deal now he's not perfect but there's no doubt he's already done irrevocable damage
[3:29:01.020 --> 3:29:06.940]  you've done damage folks this is an incredible time uh but this is our last chance and we're
[3:29:06.940 --> 3:29:12.300]  going to have tribulation we're going to have a really bad battle with the ai we got hard times
[3:29:12.300 --> 3:29:18.060]  ahead in the future the next few decades but the promised land has passed that and so god's trying
[3:29:18.060 --> 3:29:22.540]  to give us a shortcut an easier way it's still gonna be hard if we don't take this now we're
[3:29:22.540 --> 3:29:26.300]  gonna lose it all tim i appreciate you god bless you and i can feel your spirit and i love you okay

[3:35:48.700 --> 3:35:52.460]  turn this over to you tell me as soon as you get the clip that was i want to play the one we
[3:35:52.460 --> 3:35:57.500]  mentioned were democrats boot trump but we've got it let's go ahead and play that clip right now
[3:35:57.500 --> 3:36:00.220]  because david raised it and then i've got one more question for david here it is
[3:36:02.140 --> 3:36:08.460]  we must support the victims of crime i have ordered the department of homeland security
[3:36:08.460 --> 3:36:16.620]  to create an office to serve american victims the office is called voice victims of immigration
[3:36:16.620 --> 3:36:23.340]  crime engagement we are providing a voice they boot to those who have been ignored by a media
[3:36:23.340 --> 3:36:27.260]  and silenced by special interests joining us
[3:36:33.420 --> 3:36:37.500]  so you heard the booth and they admitted they boo they went and bitched on tv after it
[3:36:37.500 --> 3:36:43.420]  you've got rape awareness groups you've got child abuse awareness groups you've got groups that are
[3:36:43.420 --> 3:36:48.380]  you know about poaching you've got organizations of things we face in communities where victims come
[3:36:48.380 --> 3:36:53.020]  together and where people organize against the abuse you have civil rights movement about the
[3:36:53.020 --> 3:36:59.340]  abuse of minorities good i support it my family on both sides supported but it wasn't safe to
[3:36:59.340 --> 3:37:02.780]  support it so i don't have to sit here and kiss the butt of these people they want to claim i'm
[3:37:02.780 --> 3:37:10.860]  racist because i'm white no you're racist for saying that but expanding on that coming out
[3:37:10.860 --> 3:37:16.300]  and booing saying that the victims of immigrant crime folks the worst of the worst statistically
[3:37:16.300 --> 3:37:21.900]  a very small number but still statistically flee here flee justice it's like saying a bunch of
[3:37:21.900 --> 3:37:26.140]  americans run to mexico which happens who are bank robbers murder child molesters and then mexico
[3:37:26.140 --> 3:37:29.020]  says we're not going to do anything about him mexico catches you down they're doing that they'll
[3:37:29.020 --> 3:37:36.220]  kill your ass but there's this idea of political correctness that like the railway killer i was
[3:37:36.220 --> 3:37:42.140]  20 something people he killed he'd been released dozens of times i'm like i'm going to remember
[3:37:42.140 --> 3:37:48.460]  30 something times when they knew he was a killer it's just above the law thing because they want
[3:37:48.460 --> 3:37:54.220]  to keep that flow coming of cheap labor and rob it on the wages to exploit the peasants
[3:37:55.020 --> 3:37:59.260]  alex can i jump in here yes you know you're talking about these sanctuary sanctuary cities
[3:37:59.260 --> 3:38:04.620]  and we have to remember that after trump was elected in before he became president we had
[3:38:04.620 --> 3:38:10.380]  immigrant rights groups in california say they wanted the state of california to hide
[3:38:10.380 --> 3:38:16.060]  the gang members that they had a list of from trump because they didn't want them to port it
[3:38:16.060 --> 3:38:22.460]  and now we've seen these sanctuary cities we saw denver that did not turn over a convict who had a
[3:38:22.460 --> 3:38:28.140]  weapons charge rapist armed robbery of a car and so forth on they chased him they let him lose and
[3:38:28.140 --> 3:38:33.180]  now they're after him for murder because he killed somebody and then here in austin our sanctuary
[3:38:33.180 --> 3:38:39.500]  city sheriff had a short list of just three crimes that she would turn people over to ice four and
[3:38:39.500 --> 3:38:44.060]  then there was somebody that came along that had repeatedly molested a child and that wasn't on the
[3:38:44.060 --> 3:38:48.780]  list that wasn't on her list of crimes that should turn somebody over to ice four see this is where
[3:38:48.780 --> 3:38:53.420]  we're going this is what the democrats showed themselves as last night and when that happened
[3:38:53.420 --> 3:38:58.380]  i live tweeted that out i said look at this they're booing people who are victims of crimes committed
[3:38:58.380 --> 3:39:03.900]  by illegal immigrants and i said wow and that's the thing you come here it's a free for all it's a
[3:39:03.900 --> 3:39:07.100]  free for all like serial killers you know we're always talking about mexico because that was the
[3:39:07.100 --> 3:39:12.060]  biggest group the biggest group is chinese women yeah they're coming here to have their babies and
[3:39:12.060 --> 3:39:15.580]  get everything free i mean you know it's like oh you don't like chinese people oh give me a break
[3:39:15.580 --> 3:39:19.900]  i'm not gonna play a race card you've got a chinese adopted daughter my sister's adopted korean i love
[3:39:19.900 --> 3:39:25.100]  asians i don't love people coming here and and i don't get to have my babies for free nobody pays
[3:39:25.100 --> 3:39:30.940]  for my babies they're doing it because they want anchor babies they want to be able to enjoy all the
[3:39:30.940 --> 3:39:35.340]  benefits of the welfare state the welfare state is the magnet here and that's why people come here
[3:39:35.340 --> 3:39:39.740]  from china come here from other countries and have their babies but now we've got the situation
[3:39:39.740 --> 3:39:46.860]  with deferred action on childhood arrivals uh and now we have people walking in here as anchor babies
[3:39:46.860 --> 3:39:52.140]  and that goes up to the age of 17 like these gangbangers gangbangers and they're immune from
[3:39:52.140 --> 3:39:57.180]  deportation until they're 31 and they can bring in family members those family members can get social
[3:39:57.180 --> 3:40:01.420]  security benefits even though they've never paid anything into the system even though they're not
[3:40:01.420 --> 3:40:06.700]  american citizens because their children came over so now we've got anchor kids that are walking
[3:40:06.700 --> 3:40:11.740]  across the border it's even worse than anger babies and we can't give a free education everyone in
[3:40:11.740 --> 3:40:17.500]  the world and if they've got hepatitis if they've got MRSA if they've got the plague if they've got
[3:40:17.500 --> 3:40:22.380]  leprosy's popping up everywhere and by the way it's an exercise of government california and other
[3:40:22.380 --> 3:40:26.860]  states i should get told this three four years ago we got leprosy in miami we got leprosy in la
[3:40:26.860 --> 3:40:30.620]  and i was getting this from health department people that were sending me stuff and they came
[3:40:30.620 --> 3:40:35.900]  on the show with their faces blurted out it's in the news now okay 30 kids got leprosy in la and one
[3:40:35.900 --> 3:40:40.860]  school we're keeping it quiet who they are they're just letting leprosy spread man that leads your
[3:40:40.860 --> 3:40:48.620]  face off i mean no they someone's got leprosy and they don't even treat them this is like military
[3:40:48.620 --> 3:40:54.460]  attack the other part of it alex is that these kids are coming in to get an education and everybody
[3:40:54.460 --> 3:40:58.860]  says oh they're getting an education that's fine we should all pay for it their own governments won't
[3:40:58.860 --> 3:41:03.020]  pay for their education so they send them here to be educated at the expense of the american
[3:41:03.020 --> 3:41:09.740]  taxpayers joke what is what is the tax that pays for schools it's primarily property taxes what has
[3:41:09.740 --> 3:41:15.420]  the american dream been it's been owning a home you're not going to own 100 thousand dollar smaller
[3:41:15.420 --> 3:41:20.700]  apartment because the american dream is being sacrificed to the dreamers to provide them a
[3:41:20.700 --> 3:41:25.260]  free education in the language of their choice and we can't do that for everybody in the world when
[3:41:25.260 --> 3:41:29.660]  their own governments won't do it that's right david i'm gonna turn this over to you you can go to
[3:41:29.660 --> 3:41:34.220]  if you want if not it was the last four minutes you play through whatever it's uh what do we have
[3:41:34.220 --> 3:41:40.220]  it cut down to it's a minute 45 that you take over david great job and again i'm gonna try to get
[3:41:40.220 --> 3:41:44.780]  more crew in here we can work on the weekends late at night i want to add more shows but this is
[3:41:44.780 --> 3:41:48.940]  sophisticated tv internet network system and even mainline tv people can't run but we're
[3:41:48.940 --> 3:41:53.020]  intending to add more shows soon we're intending to add more hosts we're intending to add more
[3:41:53.020 --> 3:41:59.980]  special reports i want to get where we're going about 14 15 hours a day live here but we've
[3:41:59.980 --> 3:42:03.340]  got to have the funding to do it so thank you all for the funding and support god bless you all
[3:42:03.340 --> 3:42:07.820]  uh uh back to uh donald trump speech last night and then david night from austin texas
[3:42:08.940 --> 3:42:13.500]  think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people
[3:42:13.500 --> 3:42:20.140]  that's right cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope that's
[3:42:20.140 --> 3:42:27.500]  right american footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream wow millions lifted from welfare
[3:42:27.500 --> 3:42:33.420]  to work she destined not believing me to expect that's what built this and streets where mothers are safe
[3:42:33.420 --> 3:42:38.460]  from fear don't tell me it doesn't work schools where children learn in peace and jobs where
[3:42:38.460 --> 3:42:43.500]  affection is clip over to zemberman i'm not i'm gonna do a whole report on this right now and david's done
[3:42:45.980 --> 3:42:52.060]  footprints on distant worlds yeah cures of diseases in our hands folks they say all that
[3:42:52.060 --> 3:42:57.500]  never happened now we're like gods compared to the technology we had a hundred years ago folks those
[3:42:57.500 --> 3:43:02.860]  people are like gods compared to a thousand it's all ours we will have made america greater than
[3:43:02.860 --> 3:43:11.100]  ever before for all americans this is our vision this is our mission but we can only get there together
[3:43:11.100 --> 3:43:17.820]  that's right gotta come together we are one people with one destiny one destiny we all bleed the same
[3:43:17.820 --> 3:43:25.340]  blood we all salute the same great american we have to be unified to have a culture and we all
[3:43:25.340 --> 3:43:31.260]  are made by the same god that's right about god we have to understand that we have to build a world
[3:43:31.260 --> 3:43:35.500]  for people the globalists just think they're so powerful we're all done no we're not done
[3:43:35.500 --> 3:43:41.420]  we're not rolling over to diane zuckerberg schmidt and your own top people are now coming over to
[3:43:41.420 --> 3:43:48.060]  our side get ready to fail we're gonna win think you'll stop seven and a half billion of us we fulfill
[3:43:48.060 --> 3:43:55.420]  this vision that's why when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom we will look back on
[3:43:55.420 --> 3:44:03.020]  tonight as when this new chapter of american greatness began that's why bill gates came out and said
[3:44:03.740 --> 3:44:09.180]  oh the bio weapons are going to be released and kill everybody i want to save you let me have full
[3:44:09.180 --> 3:44:13.740]  control when he writes white paper saying kill everybody and then in public goes i want to save
[3:44:13.740 --> 3:44:20.780]  you and hops around if there's any big bio weapon attacks your suspect number one bill know it all
[3:44:20.780 --> 3:44:26.860]  gates ted ted was on the show earlier today he worked inside the new world order been part of
[3:44:26.860 --> 3:44:34.540]  the whole deal ted malik i mean look get ready to win go ahead to have a night absolutely Alex
[3:44:34.540 --> 3:44:37.980]  you're absolutely right you know when we look at this and we look at technology and we talk about
[3:44:37.980 --> 3:44:44.140]  all the wonders that can happen we also need to be aware of how this can all go south as somebody
[3:44:44.140 --> 3:44:49.740]  who always loved technology as an engineer it's why i became an engineer and as i look at the
[3:44:49.740 --> 3:44:55.020]  different uses that technology is being put to it's turning me into what some people call a
[3:44:55.020 --> 3:45:00.380]  luddite because the issue is this technology is just a tool and it can be used for good or evil
[3:45:00.380 --> 3:45:07.500]  the issue is who controls that tool a good person or an evil person see when our country
[3:45:07.500 --> 3:45:12.620]  was created we had people who were coming at it from a christian point of view they understood
[3:45:12.620 --> 3:45:18.060]  that man has a fallen nature said if we were angels we wouldn't need anybody to govern over us but
[3:45:18.060 --> 3:45:21.740]  since we're not angels we have to be careful about those people that we do put over us that we do
[3:45:21.740 --> 3:45:27.420]  give power to and you know we had a video that surfaced i tweeted that on my twitter account
[3:45:27.420 --> 3:45:32.700]  of this nightmare robot from google's boston dynamics and what they have done is they've
[3:45:32.700 --> 3:45:37.820]  created this hybrid that doesn't just walk but it's got wheels and it's also got arms so it
[3:45:37.820 --> 3:45:45.260]  can climb and it can use the the arms to get it over certain areas and they referred to it as a
[3:45:45.260 --> 3:45:52.380]  nightmare robot by their own description and it's so concerned the people at google that they said
[3:45:52.380 --> 3:45:58.220]  we need to kind of disassociate google with us because google bought all the promising robotics
[3:45:58.220 --> 3:46:03.420]  companies a couple of years ago as part of this DARPA process uh DARPA would have these robot
[3:46:03.420 --> 3:46:07.900]  contests and all the most promising companies were bought by google all at once and of course
[3:46:07.900 --> 3:46:13.660]  they're working with ray Kurzweil who has a vision of man and machine merging of machines
[3:46:13.660 --> 3:46:18.940]  becoming superior to us the artificial intelligence the singularity that's all uh the idea of ray
[3:46:18.940 --> 3:46:24.940]  Kurzweil we need a racism the human race against 60 and robots and control by the globalist we need
[3:46:24.940 --> 3:46:30.780]  human racism human lives matter and let's let's put that out there and let's let's make sure folks
[3:46:31.420 --> 3:46:37.180]  that we have the tools to control this because uh this is something that is very very dangerous and
[3:46:37.180 --> 3:46:40.700]  i could talk for that a while and actually i will talk about that tonight on the nightly news but
[3:46:40.700 --> 3:46:45.740]  i'm not going to go into that right now i want to get back to this issue where we are in globalism
[3:46:45.740 --> 3:46:50.940]  and how we can win because ted malik being on today is very very important i talked about this
[3:46:50.940 --> 3:46:56.860]  three weeks ago when everybody he was tipped as being trump's pick for us ambassador so everybody
[3:46:56.860 --> 3:47:01.020]  started talking about he was getting all these interviews throughout europe he said things like
[3:47:01.020 --> 3:47:06.060]  look i was part of taking down the soviet union there's another union that needs to be taken
[3:47:06.060 --> 3:47:11.340]  down right now it's a veiled threat to them and then they said we don't want you as EU ambassador
[3:47:11.340 --> 3:47:15.100]  we're going to stop you from being EU ambassador he said well maybe you didn't realize it but we
[3:47:15.100 --> 3:47:19.100]  had an election you don't have anything to say about that he said donald trump is not going to
[3:47:19.100 --> 3:47:26.220]  be cowed down and neither am i so i hope this is someone that we get as the EU ambassador very key
[3:47:26.220 --> 3:47:31.900]  to have somebody who is articulate who knows what's going on who has been behind the scenes his book
[3:47:31.900 --> 3:47:37.980]  i was he said behind the scenes behind the curtain of the elite this is somebody who knows exactly
[3:47:37.980 --> 3:47:43.260]  what it is very articulate as i did a couple of videos one of them the title was america's
[3:47:43.260 --> 3:47:48.380]  nigel forage he really is he's somebody who can stand up to the globalist who knows exactly what
[3:47:48.380 --> 3:47:53.260]  they're about and can really take them down also when he talked about davos man being dead you
[3:47:53.260 --> 3:48:00.700]  understand davos man is the term that they created the globalist created they tried to hide bill
[3:48:00.700 --> 3:48:06.780]  de berg but they were openly bragging about davos sure davos is the next man the transcendent man
[3:48:06.780 --> 3:48:12.860]  yes and they are going to run your life yes they self-identified they said we have no country
[3:48:12.860 --> 3:48:17.980]  we are globalists we don't have any loyalty to any country and so he's taking that on directly
[3:48:17.980 --> 3:48:23.340]  alex as he talked about donald trump is going to oppose any supranational organization we need
[3:48:23.340 --> 3:48:27.500]  to not keep consolidating things into a world government so he's going to oppose that ted
[3:48:27.500 --> 3:48:31.900]  malik is a great guy and we need to do what we can to try to push that i never thought we would
[3:48:31.900 --> 3:48:36.860]  stop tpp and we got the awareness out there and of course without donald trump we wouldn't have
[3:48:36.860 --> 3:48:42.540]  stopped it i mean the only person who was pushing for that other than donald trump was bernie sanders
[3:48:42.540 --> 3:48:46.540]  and he wasn't doing it for the same reasons bernie sanders is not worried about world government
[3:48:46.540 --> 3:48:50.460]  but i would have supported bernie sanders if he had won if he was fighting the tpp i would have
[3:48:50.460 --> 3:48:54.620]  supported him on that issue even though he wanted to stop it for different reasons and i wanted to
[3:48:54.620 --> 3:49:00.140]  stop it for he only saw the danger of the threat that it posed to american workers it was much
[3:49:00.140 --> 3:49:04.060]  broader than that and he didn't want to talk about that he didn't want to talk about the global issues
[3:49:04.060 --> 3:49:08.860]  but we have to get together we have to work and we have to push on this and i think we need to push
[3:49:08.860 --> 3:49:14.300]  back on this because there's been a lot of pushback even within the trump administration on ted malik
[3:49:14.300 --> 3:49:19.420]  because there's people within the trump administration that are soft on this whole issue so that's
[3:49:19.420 --> 3:49:25.020]  very key then on the other hand when we look at this i say like i would have supported bernie sanders
[3:49:25.020 --> 3:49:30.460]  and opposing tpp i will support paul ryan when he's right on a tax issue and i think he is right
[3:49:30.460 --> 3:49:35.020]  on this it got my attention yesterday on the drudge report when i said that bannon and ryan
[3:49:35.020 --> 3:49:40.220]  were looking at a tax proposal together and i thought well i do trust bannon bannon really
[3:49:40.220 --> 3:49:45.340]  does understand what's going on like ted malik paul ryan i've never trusted he's lied to us over
[3:49:45.340 --> 3:49:50.460]  and over again and at first when donald trump was talking about reducing the corporate income tax
[3:49:50.460 --> 3:49:55.980]  from 35 to 15 ryan was coming back saying no no no we're not going to go below 20 but then they
[3:49:55.980 --> 3:50:00.620]  came back with this border adjustment the center right will drop it to 20 but for goods that are
[3:50:00.620 --> 3:50:06.700]  coming into the country will add an additional 20 so then those taxes would be at 40 instead of the
[3:50:06.700 --> 3:50:13.500]  35 that's there it's not a big oppressive change in terms of tax system but here's the key thing
[3:50:13.500 --> 3:50:20.300]  that they're talking about and that is taking the tax on goods that we export down to zero you
[3:50:20.300 --> 3:50:24.220]  understand how they have rigged the playing field do you under you have to understand this
[3:50:24.220 --> 3:50:32.140]  because this is the key to export what's that the EU has zero tax we export exactly the same thing
[3:50:32.140 --> 3:50:36.460]  that's fair exactly that's what european government that's what the european government the EU has
[3:50:36.460 --> 3:50:40.940]  been doing a long time to have these large taxes internally but if they send something to another
[3:50:40.940 --> 3:50:46.300]  country it comes out without any of those internal taxes our goods go to compete another market's
[3:50:46.300 --> 3:50:51.580]  carrying all of the american taxes with them as a burden that must stop at the very least that has
[3:50:51.580 --> 3:50:58.300]  to stop so it will be right back i love that charlie or uh that's harley davison's thing they talked
[3:50:58.300 --> 3:51:04.620]  about what if extendivite really works but you find that hard to believe and you spend precious

[3:54:11.980 --> 3:54:16.860]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host this last of the fourth hour
[3:54:16.860 --> 3:54:23.020]  we were just talking about the order adjustment tax the BAT not the VAT the value added tax that
[3:54:23.020 --> 3:54:26.940]  they have in europe and of course as we said just before we went to the break when they have these
[3:54:26.940 --> 3:54:32.940]  internal taxes in europe they add a tax at every stage of production and then a final sales tax
[3:54:32.940 --> 3:54:38.380]  they call all of those a value added tax at every stage where you add a value they add a tax so it's
[3:54:38.380 --> 3:54:44.300]  very expensive and they do a good job of hiding it but then they remove that if they want to send
[3:54:44.300 --> 3:54:47.900]  it into a foreign country and last night we heard donald trump talking about harley david
[3:54:47.900 --> 3:54:54.220]  said he said look they've put 100 tax on american motorcycles being sold in these other markets
[3:54:54.220 --> 3:55:02.300]  they double the price to make it non-competitive but then it also carries a 35 tax on everything
[3:55:02.300 --> 3:55:07.260]  that they sell into that market with it because those are taxes that we put on here in america
[3:55:07.260 --> 3:55:12.780]  you understand you have to understand when we talk about these taxes what has gotten us to the point
[3:55:12.780 --> 3:55:17.180]  of where we are we all know that they've outsourced jobs we all know that they've
[3:55:17.180 --> 3:55:22.140]  used slave labor in china in the manufacturing facilities if people jumping off to the point
[3:55:22.140 --> 3:55:27.420]  they have to have suicide nets because of working conditions so we have these people like walmart who
[3:55:27.420 --> 3:55:33.420]  have exploited this and now walmart and a hundred other retailers have banded together to oppose
[3:55:33.420 --> 3:55:39.100]  anything that would change this system that they've become so rich off of so the process is called
[3:55:39.100 --> 3:55:43.580]  arbitrage you find two markets you find a market where somebody's got something really cheap but
[3:55:43.580 --> 3:55:47.740]  you know in your home market it's selling very expensive so you go buy it in that market where
[3:55:47.740 --> 3:55:53.020]  you get it cheap and you sell it in the other market you arbitrage that and they have become
[3:55:53.020 --> 3:55:58.540]  multi multi billionaires out of doing that we've got giant ships the size of a city coming from
[3:55:58.540 --> 3:56:03.260]  china for walmart goods going back completely empty that's the trade imbalance we're all aware of
[3:56:03.260 --> 3:56:11.100]  that but what you don't understand is how they have hobbled american workers and american businesses
[3:56:11.100 --> 3:56:17.580]  by putting a tax burden on anything we try to sell to somebody else that is a systematic
[3:56:18.380 --> 3:56:22.220]  penalty on american business that's been put there by these globalist corporations and now
[3:56:22.220 --> 3:56:27.260]  they're banding together and they're running ads where on the programs that donald trump
[3:56:27.260 --> 3:56:31.020]  watches that they know he watches saturday night live they know he watches fox and friends
[3:56:31.020 --> 3:56:37.580]  so they put these ads there to oppose it and i have to also point out this zero percent tax
[3:56:37.580 --> 3:56:43.660]  on exports which has to be a component of making america great again they would also put this 20
[3:56:43.660 --> 3:56:48.300]  percent tax on imports that are coming into our country and it would not just be on manufactured
[3:56:48.300 --> 3:56:53.900]  goods but it would also be on services all these people want to outsource jobs to india and other
[3:56:53.900 --> 3:56:58.380]  places because they don't want to pay american workers will there be a tax on that as well see
[3:56:58.380 --> 3:57:03.260]  that's why it's very important we just saw this pivot the end of last week it was an interview
[3:57:03.260 --> 3:57:07.180]  that donald trump gave to reuters magazine earlier in the month he said well i don't know
[3:57:07.180 --> 3:57:11.340]  that seems to be very complicated i don't love it it's too complicated he understands
[3:57:11.900 --> 3:57:17.180]  that the way they get around the rules is by having it very very complicated this old saying
[3:57:17.180 --> 3:57:22.140]  that it certainly applies to the income tax for example when the rules are sufficiently complex
[3:57:22.140 --> 3:57:27.580]  it's the same as having no rules at all these guys bury the devil in the detail so many times
[3:57:27.580 --> 3:57:31.420]  that i understand why donald trump would be suspicious of it i understand why he'd be suspicious
[3:57:31.420 --> 3:57:35.820]  of paul ryan but when you look at the fundamentals of it and of course you have to watch the details
[3:57:35.820 --> 3:57:40.780]  but the fundamentals of it putting an import tax on at the same time you drop internal taxes
[3:57:41.740 --> 3:57:47.900]  on businesses which is going to let them hire people and expand and then take off the taxes
[3:57:47.900 --> 3:57:53.820]  when you're trying to export into other markets that is key we have to really push for that we
