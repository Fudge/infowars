[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.240]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this live Thursday already the fifth day
[00:31.240 --> 00:40.160]  hard to believe of November 2015 we have a lot of key information obviously to cover today Ron
[00:40.160 --> 00:46.920]  Paul is joining us with big news on campaign 2016 and more today but look at the front page
[00:46.920 --> 00:56.000]  of drudgereport.com we reported on this yesterday video pottymouth kids trash Trump and it's the
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.760]  video itself where the little kids wearing a shirt says deport racism so again if you deport
[01:02.760 --> 01:11.480]  anyone even a felon it's racism but when Mexico or China deport somebody it's a okay and just the
[01:11.480 --> 01:18.520]  arrogance and the entitlement I mean if I was going to make a video to blow up in someone's face
[01:18.520 --> 01:24.680]  it would be this it has little kids cussing and flipping people off exploiting children Paul Watson
[01:24.680 --> 01:29.880]  did an article yesterday about feminist at a university exploiting like four five six seven
[01:29.880 --> 01:36.280]  eight year old kids they run the gamut little girls basically making foul mouth statements as well
[01:36.280 --> 01:43.480]  and talking about rape culture and don't rape me and all this stuff I mean this is just a group
[01:43.480 --> 01:49.960]  of really aggressive weirdos who don't produce anything or don't do anything but just endlessly
[01:49.960 --> 01:57.400]  complain that people are oppressing them I mean it's really starting to get old now we can't
[01:57.400 --> 02:01.800]  obviously play this video because there's so much cussing in it actually can we edit that out can we
[02:01.800 --> 02:09.080]  bleep that out that's coming up our report is up on drugs report comm speaking of the drugs report
[02:09.080 --> 02:14.920]  video Hungarian prime minister calls migrant influx a treasonous this is a quote treasonous
[02:14.920 --> 02:22.920]  conspiracy to marginalize nation states a deliberate conceptual project which could be
[02:22.920 --> 02:31.560]  described as left wing and that is exactly what it is and you have Russia coming out and the
[02:31.560 --> 02:38.440]  government coming out Putin coming out and saying global warming and and man-made climate change
[02:38.440 --> 02:45.560]  anthropogenic climate change is a weapon system to shut down nation states and bankrupt select
[02:45.560 --> 02:51.240]  countries and starve people because that's what the globalist say it's for in the club of Rome
[02:51.800 --> 03:00.280]  and agenda 21 the UN treaty so all these leaders are doing is actually quoting what the enemy is
[03:00.280 --> 03:05.240]  saying but this is a major sea change because it is so sensational they're saying they're turning
[03:05.240 --> 03:09.800]  the lights out except for themselves to consolidate power it's so sensational that they're trying to
[03:09.800 --> 03:17.720]  reduce population it's so sensational that they're doing it to destroy the family that the average
[03:17.720 --> 03:23.560]  person just won't respond back to the enemy's arrogant attack because it's so over the top
[03:23.560 --> 03:30.600]  well the good news is leaders around the world are now speaking out and it is devastating to the
[03:30.600 --> 03:40.120]  enemy speaking of devastating to the enemy over the weekend well from the day it happened
[03:41.720 --> 03:50.600]  we began to report that clearly a plane doesn't blow up in midair and strewn itself over a mile
[03:50.600 --> 03:56.760]  unless there was a missile or bomb aka flight 93 the state police said there was a big explosion
[03:56.760 --> 04:00.440]  and it was strewn over eight miles and they spun the whole deal and showed one crater
[04:00.440 --> 04:03.960]  where a piece of the plane went in and said that was it and that disappeared into the ground
[04:03.960 --> 04:13.640]  like bugs bunny down a rabbit hole well now the uk prime minister now military experts the CIA
[04:13.640 --> 04:21.320]  they're all saying obviously this is as of last night that yes clearly it was a bomb because radar
[04:21.320 --> 04:28.360]  and satellites didn't pick up a missile and isis released a video and then blew the video up it
[04:28.360 --> 04:33.400]  was at a great distance we're showing video of it the day after it happened that day they took
[04:33.400 --> 04:37.240]  credit i mean what do you think they're going to do because russia is standing up to them in their
[04:37.240 --> 04:44.200]  head chopping operation so they're calling this the biggest terror attacks is 9 11 224 people dead
[04:44.760 --> 04:50.840]  and they're spinning it like on fox news seeing in it we need to work with the russians to stop isis
[04:50.840 --> 04:56.360]  this this is the globalist creation attacking the russians and i wouldn't be surprised if obama
[04:56.360 --> 05:00.840]  didn't give the order himself to have the bomb loaded on russia and egypt still refuse to acknowledge
[05:00.840 --> 05:05.560]  that a terrorist attack could have taken down a russian jet plane but that's not stopping neocon
[05:05.560 --> 05:11.800]  warmonger john bolton to lick his chops at the prospect of russian retaliation if it turns out that
[05:11.800 --> 05:18.040]  isis is responsible for downing this plane that is the single biggest mistake they have ever made
[05:18.040 --> 05:24.520]  because prudent now will retaliate and he won't mess around like president obama has done it will be
[05:25.240 --> 05:31.000]  i think extraordinarily massive us and uk intelligence officials are of the belief that a bomb took
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.560]  down the plane but the president has remained silent on the cause of the disaster one source tells
[05:35.560 --> 05:40.760]  the dc whispers website that there are concerns that the muslim brotherhood is responsible for the
[05:40.760 --> 05:45.400]  terror attack the muslim brotherhood has enjoyed close ties with the administration in the past
[05:45.400 --> 05:50.920]  and the source suggests measures are being taken by administration officials to make certain no such
[05:50.920 --> 05:57.800]  connection if in fact it exists will become part of the investigation read more now at info wars dot

[08:33.160 --> 08:42.680]  broadcasting worldwide it's alex johns well thanks for just getting more interesting by the
[08:42.680 --> 08:51.880]  minute aren't they as we plunge into the century of world governments the century of technocratic
[08:51.880 --> 09:03.880]  scientific dictatorship it was pretty easy to predict when we watch the west turn loose al-qaeda
[09:05.640 --> 09:11.160]  five years ago in libya to then take over the country and five years later it is a completely
[09:11.160 --> 09:17.800]  failed state hundreds of thousands are dead any black person caught in the country even though
[09:17.800 --> 09:22.760]  it is africa is basically murdered whether they're muslim or not because the radical
[09:22.760 --> 09:29.240]  wahhabist are extremely anti-black so i don't get why so many black people join wahhabist
[09:29.240 --> 09:35.160]  islam but whatever you like being called horrible names and being sold into slavery and called
[09:35.160 --> 09:41.080]  subhuman i understand it's trendy i mean look how the left and feminists love radical muslims
[09:41.080 --> 09:47.320]  and head chopping and sexual mutilation and wearing bags over their heads and they hate the west that
[09:47.320 --> 09:50.200]  empowered women i understand you're sick freaks i get it
[09:55.800 --> 10:01.720]  but we knew then that they were going to turn al-qaeda loose in syria and iraq and everywhere
[10:01.720 --> 10:08.920]  else that the west was funding them and working with saudi arabia nato turkey and others and now
[10:08.920 --> 10:15.240]  it's just out in the open the russians a month and a half ago called the bluff and sent in
[10:15.240 --> 10:27.160]  hundreds of fighter bomber aircraft and began 60 missions a day on average and began within a
[10:27.160 --> 10:34.040]  few weeks decimating the al-qaeda forces known as isis and began to break up their supply chain
[10:34.040 --> 10:42.360]  lines out of iraq and turkey they invade from two different points from the southeast and from the
[10:42.360 --> 10:50.520]  northwest linking up and the russians just blew up their command and control facilities
[10:51.960 --> 10:56.680]  and undoubtedly cia personnel in the major cities that was the first strike
[10:58.280 --> 11:05.160]  and now you've seen the strike back by the muslim brotherhood slash isis slash al-qaeda all the
[11:05.160 --> 11:17.640]  same wahhabist group the same sunni organization remember last year the saudi prince bandar
[11:17.640 --> 11:22.760]  bush is his nickname threatened the olympics instead of you don't stay out of syria we're going
[11:22.760 --> 11:29.640]  to attack your transportation and your olympics and your capital and the saudi's announced two weeks
[11:29.640 --> 11:34.520]  ago they said we're going to counter strike the russians russia be prepared for our response
[11:34.520 --> 11:37.080]  and it'll probably be more russian airplanes blown up
[11:40.200 --> 11:46.280]  and then our sickening over-the-top evil collaborator occupied captured government
[11:47.800 --> 11:53.240]  has the nerve to go on every major channel from voice of america to cnn to fox news
[11:53.240 --> 11:58.360]  to the associated press and say we're with russia in this time of pain when
[11:58.360 --> 12:04.680]  isis al-qaeda link groups blow up your passenger plane
[12:08.280 --> 12:13.480]  we're with you in this fight knowing that's nothing but pr for the american people who
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.680]  are supporting russia fighting back against isis that's been attacking targets in the russian
[12:18.680 --> 12:27.480]  held states of chechnya and other areas so this is pure pr for the politically inept
[12:27.480 --> 12:32.040]  politically illiterate politically lobotomized politically
[12:36.280 --> 12:42.280]  dumb american people and i don't mean the large minority of americans that are politically
[12:42.280 --> 12:47.880]  wearing involved some of the most politically informed involved folks in the world are in
[12:47.880 --> 12:52.520]  america and people listen to us all over the planet because they know we're informed they
[12:52.520 --> 12:59.640]  know you're informed but there is a large minority in this country that does not know what planet
[12:59.640 --> 13:03.480]  they're on and there's another large minority together they make a majority that only knows
[13:03.480 --> 13:12.920]  a little bit enough to get themselves in trouble but this is asymmetrical warfare against the
[13:12.920 --> 13:21.880]  russians it's what soros is run it's what the nato forces have run it's what the
[13:23.400 --> 13:28.280]  saudi arabians have done it's what they've openly threatened them to do i mean saudi clerics just
[13:28.280 --> 13:34.280]  last week called for a jihad against russia in syria and to back isis that's rt we covered it
[13:36.360 --> 13:39.160]  and it's starting it's happening it's going on
[13:39.160 --> 13:45.720]  some people will say well how do you know it's on a russian false flag because the russians
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.360]  would have had some patsy to blame and would have had some direction to go the russians are
[13:50.360 --> 13:55.560]  already involved in operations they've been forced into that are meant to bankrupt them
[13:58.600 --> 14:03.480]  in ukraine in chechnya in georgia in syria
[14:03.480 --> 14:12.120]  yeah there's a article right there from just last week from right bar it was also the associated
[14:12.120 --> 14:18.920]  press saudi's isis al qaeda agree time for jihad against russia the head of al qaeda four days ago
[14:18.920 --> 14:25.000]  five days ago one day before this plane got blown up came out and said we will now strike you
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.920]  we must all come together against russia
[14:26.920 --> 14:36.280]  so it's a bunch of rag tag well hobbyist suny groups but they do take their marching orders
[14:36.280 --> 14:40.600]  from their different religious leadership that takes its marching orders from saudi arabia
[14:40.600 --> 14:46.680]  turkey and others that fund them and a day after it happened hours after it happened they took credit
[14:46.680 --> 14:50.440]  and said it was a bomb on board but the day after they released a video we're showing right now
[14:50.440 --> 14:56.040]  of the plane being blown up from the central cargo hold
[14:59.320 --> 15:05.160]  somebody i would say prime suspect are saying suicide bomber they're saying no prime suspect
[15:05.160 --> 15:10.840]  someone that worked at the airport loading a bomb on the plane in a package in a suitcase
[15:12.520 --> 15:16.840]  it was a big bomb and that's what the british intelligence is saying
[15:16.840 --> 15:21.880]  uk leader more likely than not bomb brought down russian plane cia started saying that last night
[15:21.880 --> 15:26.280]  as well again we said it the day it happened i have the curtain demo article right here
[15:30.760 --> 15:36.280]  where he goes over all of it evidence reveals bomb took down russian flight that's from the
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.200]  second he also wrote it on the first when it happened and then of course is now being reported
[15:40.200 --> 15:48.200]  on the fourth and fifth by the cia and british intelligence isis this is october 31st this is
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.720]  when it happened releases video of alleged russian airplane midair explosion after it
[15:53.720 --> 16:03.880]  claims responsibility for disaster and i'm not bragging hey we told you first or zero hedge
[16:03.880 --> 16:09.640]  told you first or or roll net daily told you first or drudge report told you first it's just a fact
[16:09.640 --> 16:13.800]  that that's not hard to predict or hard to know and when our media sat there and our government
[16:13.800 --> 16:20.200]  sat there and said gee we don't know what happened it's the same ridiculous garbage like flight 93
[16:20.200 --> 16:25.080]  saying it blows up at 30 000 feet and it's strewn over eight miles and then they concoct
[16:25.080 --> 16:29.480]  some story about let's roll because they know people want to buy it and want to think americans
[16:29.480 --> 16:32.840]  would have fought back against hijackers of course americans would have fought back against
[16:32.840 --> 16:37.640]  hijackers some guy stands up with box cutters on a plane with me i'm gonna beat the living
[16:37.640 --> 16:48.760]  snot out of them or die trying and most americans most people are like that you can go to a park
[16:48.760 --> 16:52.120]  and walk up to some little guy and start shoving him and pushing him and hitting him at least in
[16:52.120 --> 16:58.120]  my day they'll get up and start fighting you back no what we were told happened on 11 didn't happen
[16:58.120 --> 17:03.560]  ladies and gentlemen we don't know exactly what happened but it is as phony as bill clinton when
[17:03.560 --> 17:12.840]  he gives you a promise so what is russia going to do about this is the big question well putin's
[17:12.840 --> 17:17.720]  approval ratings gone up even opposition parties that weren't supporting putin now are and they're
[17:17.720 --> 17:22.920]  circling the wagons and i was putting i just come out and say these people are casualties of terror
[17:23.400 --> 17:27.320]  by people that want to intimidate us and we're not going to remove russian freedoms we're not
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.240]  going to grope you in the airports like they do in america we're going to find out who did this and
[17:31.240 --> 17:39.960]  we're going to kill them and that's why when they had the minister the interior minister on television
[17:39.960 --> 17:48.840]  hours after the plane was blown up on halloween hours after that happened
[17:51.240 --> 17:54.840]  he was on television in fact we got to pull that video back up shaking
[17:54.840 --> 18:02.200]  because they know that egypt is the most populous country in the middle east i know it's in africa
[18:02.200 --> 18:08.840]  but if you count it as an Arab nation it's the most populist and it is a time bomb of trying to
[18:08.840 --> 18:13.880]  feed the people a time bomb of trying to keep jobs egypt's tried to have a stable good country
[18:13.880 --> 18:17.960]  it's tried to have a free country it's done its best with radical outsiders trying to
[18:17.960 --> 18:22.600]  destabilize it and then our government four years ago removed hazy mubarak our ally and put the
[18:22.600 --> 18:28.680]  muslim brotherhood in that is al qaeda to blow up hundreds of churches crucify christians upside
[18:28.680 --> 18:35.800]  down murder sheite muslims and others until 15 million people hit the streets demanding they be
[18:35.800 --> 18:45.160]  removed remember jihaz were attacking military bases and anderson cooper of a central intelligence
[18:45.160 --> 18:51.800]  agency would get up on television when they removed mubarak and said that the muslim brotherhood were
[18:51.800 --> 18:57.080]  heroes and freedom fighters and he says the same thing about the syrian fighters for four years
[18:57.720 --> 19:05.720]  and the same thing it's so sick to watch our government run by foreign banks who then openly
[19:05.720 --> 19:15.160]  financed jihadist that have killed 300 000 people conservatively in syria most of them christians
[19:15.160 --> 19:22.040]  and caused a million to flee and now 1.8 million are all that's left in one of the oldest christian
[19:22.040 --> 19:28.840]  nations in the world where they've lived in peace for 2 000 years one of the oldest christian
[19:28.840 --> 19:38.040]  communities in the world after israel and after rome i mean think about it they sit around in
[19:38.040 --> 19:43.560]  board rooms and put people into countries that blow up every catholic and every christian and
[19:43.560 --> 19:48.680]  every orthodox church they find and they sit there and throw the priest off the top of the church's
[19:48.680 --> 19:55.400]  laughing with us weapons that's who runs our government and now the people they control
[19:55.400 --> 20:02.200]  have blown up a russian jet airliner my name is bill bonner and i have an important message
[20:02.200 --> 20:07.640]  right now the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis
[20:07.640 --> 20:13.960]  but they're about to lose control when this happens it will rip our country apart in ways
[20:13.960 --> 20:19.400]  you never imagined from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to

[25:22.120 --> 25:29.080]  peace but it's not the responsibility of this country to open up its borders and its pure
[25:29.080 --> 25:34.360]  globalism to collapse our country that's what's happening in europe this is how these big banks
[25:34.360 --> 25:41.240]  are conquering the world they've already conquered latin america africa asia with political slavery
[25:41.240 --> 25:46.280]  and economic slavery backed up a paramilitary force and now they're conquering us with divide
[25:46.280 --> 25:50.680]  and conquer and i'm going to be breaking that down coming up but getting back to this russia
[25:50.680 --> 25:56.840]  situation i've seen different numbers but some numbers are as high as 70 percent
[25:56.840 --> 26:06.520]  since the western backed arab spring took over egypt i want to go to egypt my parents want
[26:06.520 --> 26:14.520]  to go to egypt in fact my next trip i intend to go to egypt and go to israel and the politically
[26:14.520 --> 26:17.960]  correct nazis they have their own political correctness where they control reality and make
[26:17.960 --> 26:22.040]  stuff up all day i'm sure they'll say he's going to israel to get his orders and all this mental
[26:22.040 --> 26:27.240]  illness now i'm going to go to israel to see an incredibly historical place i'd love to go to
[26:27.240 --> 26:33.240]  syria talk about historical went to roam earlier this year amazing of course to get my vatican
[26:33.240 --> 26:48.360]  orders as well but it is just such a big deal to have this russian airliner blown up and it will
[26:48.360 --> 26:58.200]  only cripple their tourism industry and listen texas has oil texas has crops texas has manufacturing
[26:58.200 --> 27:03.240]  some of the only steel mills in the country or in texas but if our tourism got hit
[27:05.240 --> 27:11.000]  70 it would really hurt this state and we don't really rely on tourism sounds like austin do
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.840]  we're a major tourist destination now all over the world they fly direct here from
[27:16.840 --> 27:23.000]  london england you name it i'll be in foreign airports and come to austin come see the big
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.880]  destination imagine if the area you live in has turned into people turned over people that burn
[27:29.880 --> 27:35.160]  down churches and cut people's heads off for no reason and that blow up and attack buses full of
[27:35.160 --> 27:42.520]  western tourists and these jihadis do this because if they want to bring down the government
[27:42.520 --> 27:49.080]  that's somewhat secular and lets women go to college and they don't want westerners there
[27:49.080 --> 27:54.040]  and they want to squat in dirt huts and have harems of women that can't even talk
[27:58.600 --> 28:01.800]  and if they dare try to get a job they pour acid on their face
[28:04.280 --> 28:09.240]  and then our government doesn't bring the doctors and scientists and astronomers
[28:09.240 --> 28:14.200]  and physicists here from the middle east they got plenty of smart people oh no they don't get
[28:14.200 --> 28:21.480]  visas they bring the unwashed jihadis from the worst places here because they know they want
[28:21.480 --> 28:28.040]  to simulate they will run around and complain and getting everybody's faces and and and bully other
[28:28.040 --> 28:39.560]  muslims into submitting their radical form of islam there is what you could call modern reformed islam
[28:44.040 --> 28:51.160]  and i am not a enemy of that but i am an enemy of a middle age
[28:51.160 --> 29:02.040]  template from the middle east being projected through religion on to the west and the renaissance
[29:02.040 --> 29:07.160]  and the west has got its own problems but let me tell you we got over being in the dark ages 500
[29:07.160 --> 29:17.000]  years ago and it's time the middle east get out of them as well the big problem is the west
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.880]  doesn't want them to get up on their feet because they are smart they do have high IQs
[29:23.640 --> 29:30.680]  they are inventive and they don't want the competition only selective areas like dubai and
[29:30.680 --> 29:35.960]  saudi arabia are allowed to develop under the new world order system oh they can build the most
[29:35.960 --> 29:40.360]  high-tech cities in the world have the lowest crime rates you name it and and have the sheiks go
[29:40.360 --> 29:46.440]  to strip bars all night but everywhere else the people are oppressed well russia is going to strike

[29:58.680 --> 30:04.520]  almost immediately following the crash of russian metro jet flight 92 68 a militant group
[30:04.520 --> 30:09.960]  affiliated to isis in egypt claimed responsibility however many groups including russian officials
[30:09.960 --> 30:15.240]  express their initial skepticism that isis could achieve such a thing well now according to us
[30:15.240 --> 30:22.920]  officials an isis bomb is the most likely reason behind the russian jet crash that killed 224 people
[30:22.920 --> 30:28.520]  an official said there is a definite feeling it was an explosive device planted in luggage or
[30:28.520 --> 30:33.080]  somewhere on the plane europe has announced that those attempting to fly from charmel shake to the
[30:33.080 --> 30:39.160]  united kingdom will experience delays as authorities work to provide more security no doubt europe will
[30:39.160 --> 30:44.600]  soon be implementing its own version of tsa security theater that's clearly meant to control

[33:29.880 --> 33:37.480]  reddish intelligence is on record probably more than anybody funding isis and al-qaeda
[33:39.720 --> 33:47.080]  the leader of the 77 bombing a swat was mi6 that came out on fox news and i can play the clip
[33:47.080 --> 33:58.600]  just type in head of 77 bombings mi6 you'll get roiders ap bbc fox news i've had john loftus
[33:58.600 --> 34:03.000]  former head of anti-terrorism the justice department on to talk about it we should get
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.440]  loftus back on he's a good guest i mean this is really going on so cameron comes out and says how
[34:08.440 --> 34:12.840]  dare isis do this we believe it's isis we're we stand with russia against this
[34:15.640 --> 34:21.720]  because they go full well they have funded isis with nato the united states turkey and others
[34:21.720 --> 34:28.200]  saw the arabia with the money for four or five years they just started calling it isis in the last
[34:28.200 --> 34:35.240]  year and a half and then the white house comes out and says yeah looks like it's isis boy we're
[34:35.240 --> 34:40.840]  upset we better you know crack down on people's rights here in america for the very threat they've
[34:40.840 --> 34:46.760]  helped emboldened i thought al qaeda you know two years ago was gone and defeated and now it's just
[34:46.760 --> 34:53.160]  back bigger than ever working with isis the same group now it's got a multi hundred thousand man army
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.160]  so they get to take western liberties because of this threat they get to roll out more naked
[35:01.160 --> 35:06.600]  body scanners they've got all these different jihad groups that aren't even controlled by the last
[35:06.600 --> 35:12.600]  they were bred they were created like i said if you've bred and raised a hundred black widows
[35:12.600 --> 35:19.880]  and then went and dumped them in your neighbor's bedroom during the day knowing they'd go underneath
[35:19.880 --> 35:28.680]  the the bed during the sunlight and come out at night and bites you do you run the black widows
[35:28.680 --> 35:34.120]  do you control them no did you breed them did you dump them in the bed yes same thing with a rattlesnake
[35:34.120 --> 35:43.800]  it's like do you control an ampule of pure cyanide does it love you does it have a consciousness
[35:43.800 --> 35:47.800]  does it follow your orders no but if you put it in somebody's iced tea and they take one drink
[35:47.800 --> 35:51.880]  they're going to die in 60 seconds flopping around on the ground biting their tongue off
[35:57.160 --> 36:03.080]  and so you're still 100% guilty of the black widow of the rattlesnake of the cyanide
[36:03.080 --> 36:09.000]  if it kills the person so the way the west is acting it's almost like they may not have ordered
[36:09.000 --> 36:17.320]  the muslim brotherhood ices al-Nusra al-Qaeda all the same people to do this because the west is
[36:17.320 --> 36:23.080]  really distancing itself from this or is it more of the cynical double-edged game of hey we didn't
[36:23.080 --> 36:28.280]  do this we didn't do this i've told you over and over again that the ices forces and al-Qaeda forces
[36:28.280 --> 36:32.280]  they've turned loose will start blowing up jet airliners and i predicted they'll start doing it
[36:32.280 --> 36:37.160]  with stinger missiles and so everybody's saying this is a bomb and satellites didn't pick it up
[36:37.160 --> 36:44.920]  and radar didn't pick up a missile i looked into that a lot of times radar doesn't pick up a small
[36:44.920 --> 36:49.080]  missile now i looked into something else
[36:53.640 --> 36:56.760]  it could have been somebody there working inside the airport that did it the british
[36:56.760 --> 37:00.120]  intelligence says they're gonna stop flying british flights probably out of that airport
[37:00.120 --> 37:03.160]  they think common sense that it would probably be somebody on the ground
[37:04.520 --> 37:07.960]  it's easier to do that than to smuggle a bomb on board you just an inside job
[37:08.520 --> 37:14.520]  you load a bomb in a suitcase or a briefcase or a backpack or you load it in with the food
[37:14.520 --> 37:17.800]  shipment that's being put on board the plane in a compartment
[37:20.520 --> 37:24.600]  but clapper came out the day after it happened and said ices might be able to shoot down aircraft
[37:24.600 --> 37:32.760]  with service air missiles that was in sputnik news but he made the quote to us reporters
[37:34.680 --> 37:40.600]  made the statement so this could be a missile i'm not saying that we we obviously know it didn't
[37:40.600 --> 37:46.360]  just blow up on its own now i mean day one we knew that but see they don't want people panicking over
[37:46.360 --> 37:52.280]  the thousands of surface air missiles that the jihadis now have and they could be holding people
[37:52.280 --> 37:58.520]  hostage and saying if russia and the us and others don't start paying us and don't let us take over
[37:58.520 --> 38:05.240]  part of syria and iraq and set up our caliphate we will shoot down 10 jetliners next week 20 the
[38:05.240 --> 38:13.960]  next and 30 the next a hundred the next and i said this probably a hundred plus times and told
[38:13.960 --> 38:18.520]  folks to mark down the dates of it i don't know if we did on the show the last few years since
[38:18.520 --> 38:23.480]  Benghazi saying this would end up happening and it looks like we're now entering that area
[38:24.840 --> 38:28.360]  there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that we're not being told about
[38:28.360 --> 38:31.000]  but i know how these groups operate i know their mindset
[38:33.560 --> 38:39.080]  but whether it was a bomb altitude triggered bomb or whether it was a missile
[38:39.080 --> 38:48.920]  missile the main suspects are the saudi arabian sunni lobbyist running rampant all over the world
[38:48.920 --> 38:55.320]  from indonesia to iraq to the united states and when they shoot up an army navy recruiting center
[38:55.320 --> 38:59.240]  when they shoot up a marine corps recruiting center when they shoot up a
[38:59.240 --> 39:10.280]  dallas suburb of garland what does the media say they were muslims but it's not connected to terror
[39:14.920 --> 39:19.640]  but every couple of years some lunatic into a death cult it's always the same they're always
[39:19.640 --> 39:24.760]  obsessed with weird comic books that are into death that's just the mo that's the criminology
[39:24.760 --> 39:29.800]  they've had maybe once every couple years some group go out and shoot cops or go out and shoot
[39:29.800 --> 39:37.160]  people and then they tenuously connect them out of their hard drive to visiting info wars.com
[39:38.840 --> 39:45.320]  our tea party usa and then they go on the news and say listeners of alex jones killed cops in vegas
[39:46.680 --> 39:52.760]  but when it's actual jihadists saying on their facebook i'm doing this for the caliphate i'm doing
[39:52.760 --> 39:58.760]  this then it's oh no that's not related or connected or anything else it's uh no it's the team party's
[39:58.760 --> 40:05.400]  fault so i asked the question ron paul is coming up at the bottom of the next hour but i want to
[40:05.400 --> 40:11.080]  open the phones up on this situation with police military former military airline people security
[40:11.080 --> 40:15.320]  folks i want to get your take i mean you think i'm wrong in any way and what do you think russia's
[40:15.320 --> 40:21.880]  response is going to be and my gut just tells me that there are ransoms going out right now that's
[40:21.880 --> 40:27.640]  just nobody else is saying that my gut tells me they wanted those thousands of missiles they wanted
[40:27.640 --> 40:34.040]  stevens out of the way and we know this so that they could do whatever they wanted with those
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.880]  missiles and it was something big and i said is it hold the west hostage and create some global
[40:39.880 --> 40:49.160]  crisis in the future or is it a covert plan to threaten to bring passenger liner traffic to
[40:49.160 --> 40:56.200]  a standstill in many regions which would devastate the economy so you don't have to wait for specter
[40:56.200 --> 41:01.400]  to come out in a few weeks to go watch a action adventure movie with evil organizations manipulating
[41:01.400 --> 41:09.320]  in the real world that's what's going on and i'm just sitting back watching this and i think there's
[41:09.320 --> 41:16.120]  more than meets the eye beneath the surface i mean we know there is but my gut tells me there's
[41:16.120 --> 41:23.560]  ransoms going on here my gut tells me the muslim brotherhood is telling the egyptian
[41:23.560 --> 41:28.840]  government you're gonna let us come back to power or we're gonna blow up five more jet
[41:28.840 --> 41:34.120]  airliners in egypt alone in the next month and then you're not gonna have any money coming into
[41:34.120 --> 41:40.360]  the economy is going to implode we're gonna cut the golden goose's head off i mean some estimates
[41:40.360 --> 41:49.640]  are half of egypt's economy is tourism the rest is obviously agrarian it's a farming culture
[41:51.240 --> 41:57.640]  and they've got a giant young population it is a time bomb and it came out the egyptian courts
[41:57.640 --> 42:04.680]  they have the documents that obama's family out of kenyan just south of egypt is quarterbacking
[42:04.680 --> 42:10.760]  key term running the muslim brotherhood operations in that country and now the state department and
[42:10.760 --> 42:17.240]  others are saying could it be connected let articles on info wars dot com could it be connected
[42:19.720 --> 42:26.280]  to the muslim brotherhood and is that why obama is so silent is obama now being held hostage
[42:26.280 --> 42:34.040]  let's look at some of these headlines up on info wars dot com piers morgan isis will nuke america
[42:35.080 --> 42:39.000]  member obama said the one thing he's worried about said nuke going off of manhattan now how about
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.160]  obama nuke's america and declares a civil emergency video hungarian prime minister calls migrant influx
[42:45.160 --> 42:52.280]  a treasonous conspiracy to marginalize nation states bingo bingo bingo you win the prize blue
[42:52.280 --> 43:00.360]  ribbon neocon warmonger expects extraordinarily massive that's see watson's headline military
[43:00.360 --> 43:07.800]  retaliation by putin against isis over russia plane crash you know i don't like bolton and
[43:07.800 --> 43:11.080]  bolton was a warmonger and it helped why about iraq and what happened there but
[43:13.400 --> 43:17.960]  i don't even know if the statement warmonger even means anything the former ambassador to the un the
[43:17.960 --> 43:24.600]  u.s the former u.s ambassador to the un expects a huge response from russia that's and then you
[43:24.600 --> 43:31.640]  can add in there that he's a warmonger um the point is he's probably right
[43:35.560 --> 43:40.040]  there it is sourced obama fears muslim brotherhood linked to downing a russian airliner he fears it
[43:41.720 --> 43:47.640]  they took credit for it who do you think the muslim brotherhood is it is the sunnis and i don't
[43:47.640 --> 43:53.960]  mean every sunni muslim is is a is a bad person look look at syrian girl her family or exiles
[43:53.960 --> 43:57.320]  out of syria they don't like a sod deterrence breaking the country up and killing everybody
[43:58.120 --> 44:02.760]  it's radical islam run by saudi arabia who wants to dictate islam to everybody else
[44:03.720 --> 44:09.000]  obama's brother's linked directly to the muslim brotherhood his cousin he had a in a memo to his
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.720]  cousin when he was a senator he said have riots be staged odinga all over the country
[44:13.720 --> 44:18.920]  and then they'll they'll give you a position in the government they made a prime minister ship for him
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.320]  and that's what they're threatening now with quentin tarantino and look i had a lawyer in
[44:25.320 --> 44:30.200]  here yesterday that's suing the awesome police department over a detective killing somebody in
[44:30.200 --> 44:35.160]  cold blood and the guys who just admit he broke down is mentally ill probably i'm not saying
[44:35.160 --> 44:39.880]  i'm just saying it seems like it's crazy you know witnesses were there the guys had to admit it just
[44:39.880 --> 44:45.880]  got him out of his knees and shot the guy in the back of the head for just no reason we expose bad cops
[44:45.880 --> 44:53.320]  but statistically police kill what is it about 400 500 people a year
[44:57.640 --> 45:02.920]  i mean back in the 70s and 60s it was thousands a year because there were shootouts and violence
[45:02.920 --> 45:10.840]  and cops have always had some bad people there's always been problems i mean we we expose that
[45:11.080 --> 45:17.880]  but quentin tarantino with the movies he puts out like jingo and chain and and and all of this
[45:17.880 --> 45:22.200]  is torture porn race porn exploitation porn
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.120]  and it is designed
[45:26.120 --> 45:36.440]  100 to create racial division and i happen to know folks that have worked with robert rodriguez's best
[45:36.440 --> 45:41.480]  buddy and that are connected to tarantino and they meet with obama they meet with the winestein
[45:41.480 --> 45:48.120]  brothers they have an agenda and are given the funding to create racial division i mean that's
[45:48.120 --> 45:53.960]  obvious now but i told you about it years ago robert rodriguez hates me so much
[45:53.960 --> 45:59.560]  that if you even mentioned my name to him he begins exploding in anger
[46:01.160 --> 46:05.240]  i was told this on the set of scanner darkly
[46:09.160 --> 46:12.600]  back when rodriguez was still married his ex-wife was a listener
[46:15.560 --> 46:18.840]  he hates white people so much he left his hispanic wife for white women
[46:18.840 --> 46:23.560]  but his hispanic wife is a big listener co-owner of his studios
[46:25.080 --> 46:29.160]  that she tried to give him some of my films and he had a complete meltdown and he's been
[46:29.160 --> 46:33.960]  in the newspapers attacking me because i know the white house funds him to put out movies that
[46:33.960 --> 46:40.920]  show good old boys shooting pregnant hispanic women that's not going on brother that we can
[46:40.920 --> 46:50.440]  even find are 100 000 mexicans getting killed by other corrupt mexicans do they catch uh people
[46:50.440 --> 46:54.280]  coming across the board have already paid to be coyoteed in and then they torture him to death
[46:54.280 --> 46:59.480]  and suck money out of their family oh but that's not in your film is it because you're too cool
[46:59.480 --> 47:06.040]  hanging out with all the south texas el hefe's aren't you the truth is you all think it's real
[47:06.040 --> 47:09.800]  fun to wear your fancy cowboy hat and your boots and fly around in helicopters and hang around with
[47:09.800 --> 47:15.000]  all the rich mexicans we know who they are don't we and then you make a movie where white people
[47:15.000 --> 47:21.720]  are shooting mexicans in the stomach don't you of course you don't make a movie where white cia agents
[47:21.720 --> 47:26.040]  are helping destabilize the country and part of it those are the white people involved no no no
[47:26.040 --> 47:30.040]  or hispanics being forcibly injected with Gardasil that basically sterilizes them
[47:30.040 --> 47:39.880]  no no no no no see he doesn't hate me because i'm white he hates me because i know who he is
[47:40.920 --> 47:45.960]  he's a dirtbag just like quintin tarantino am i against tarantino because he went and said
[47:45.960 --> 47:50.280]  some of these blacks are getting murdered by crazy cops absolutely there's bad cops it's
[47:50.280 --> 47:55.640]  going on they're getting indicted in many areas cops shot that black guy in the back of the park
[47:55.640 --> 48:01.960]  got gone on video indicted and he better get convicted eat that cops crazy that cops a trigger
[48:01.960 --> 48:08.760]  happy murderer but cops aren't murderers like tarantino said in the speech that the police
[48:08.760 --> 48:13.560]  are murderers and now he's doubled down since the boycott and he says they're white supremacists
[48:13.560 --> 48:19.880]  that's right let me tell you i've had crazy black cops crazy hispanic cops crazy white cops and i'm
[48:19.880 --> 48:23.960]  not stereotyping my main problem has been female cops and there's been some cool ones too but man
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.600]  most of my problems have been with just chip on their shoulder female cops just want to get in
[48:28.600 --> 48:36.360]  my face i'm a nice guy unless you're trampling on my rice what we have is some jerks and control
[48:36.360 --> 48:43.800]  freaks that have been given murderous training but here's the deal quintin tarantino knows
[48:43.800 --> 48:51.080]  full well what he's doing he is financed by the government through hollywood whether his films
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.520]  make money or not a lot of them are losers now to go out there and stand around with a bunch of
[48:56.520 --> 49:04.680]  sad black women have lost their sons and to basically push his film that's coming out
[49:07.880 --> 49:13.400]  it's backfiring he doesn't care he knows his audience he knows hollywood the white house backing
[49:13.400 --> 49:18.920]  the same white house through soros and sharpen funding all this anti cop stuff it's all part of
[49:18.920 --> 49:24.760]  the weaponization of the media but here's the good news you know how i got the script of machete
[49:24.760 --> 49:29.080]  three months before it came out and then rodriguez said that's not the script of course it was the
[49:29.080 --> 49:37.000]  exact script he lied in the associated press i got it from a hispanic person high up in his
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.000]  organization who thought it was extremely racist and who told me uh he's meeting with a white
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  house he's got a whole channel coming out it's meant to create division it's sick that's all i
[49:47.000 --> 49:57.800]  can tell you i can't tell you more because the average hispanic person sits around in a board room
[49:57.800 --> 50:02.360]  hearing about getting people to fight with each other and gets very upset this is sick this is
[50:02.360 --> 50:09.640]  evil this is premeditated warfare and lord knows there's some bad cops out there that deserve
[50:09.640 --> 50:13.800]  punishment and they get away with a lot of stuff and corrupt jurisdictions but man let me tell you
[50:13.800 --> 50:18.040]  the globalists don't want to start a war with the police to help this country or get justice
[50:18.040 --> 50:23.720]  they want to burn this country down just like they did ukraine to bring in tyranny and they'll
[50:23.720 --> 50:33.080]  use any factions they can to do it when tarantino walked over to me one time i went and saw the
[50:33.080 --> 50:38.280]  fritz connection is also the exorcist was showing after it was the same director and i was a fan of
[50:38.280 --> 50:45.640]  the fritz connection so i went and saw it and tarantino marched over to me i said what are you
[50:45.640 --> 50:53.880]  doing here just just stop talking i mean just just just talk about the guys are really a no
[50:53.880 --> 51:02.840]  talent he made one good movie pulp fiction i mean he really is a joke earthquake floods
[51:02.840 --> 51:08.520]  winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us have had that moment when we recognize that
[51:08.520 --> 51:13.240]  we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we
[51:13.240 --> 51:18.360]  address the need for water but have you considered heat storage i'm talking about staying warm in
[51:18.360 --> 51:24.040]  the cold here are some things for you to consider how will i keep my family warm the standard answers
[51:24.040 --> 51:29.080]  are firewood coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't
[51:29.080 --> 51:34.280]  take it with you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke
[51:34.280 --> 51:39.880]  like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler
[51:39.880 --> 51:45.720]  and less costly than you think for these answers go to fortress clothing dot com again fortress

[55:33.320 --> 55:37.240]  i gotta cover this coming up in the next hour but not because it's about me but because it shows
[55:37.240 --> 55:42.920]  enemy operations and it shows people praying on their audiences praying on their viewers and
[55:42.920 --> 55:55.320]  listeners with hateful conceit and and and and just twisted bad will bill marr put info wars.com
[55:56.120 --> 56:04.440]  up during his news segment and put a fake headline on it saying that cancer is good
[56:04.440 --> 56:09.400]  for you and that it's a conspiracy that cancer is bad for you
[56:09.400 --> 56:14.520]  now this isn't even really subliminal
[56:15.800 --> 56:22.520]  we've caught hbo we've caught cnn fox news comedy central doing similar things where

[56:53.160 --> 56:57.480]  internet freedom and that shows a picture of me i mean i'm not a sex offender i've never been
[56:57.480 --> 57:01.240]  charged with anything i could win a lawsuit against newscore but they don't care
[57:01.240 --> 57:06.360]  but you know what we're gonna expose you and that's what matters

[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.280]  that they're now saying a bomb or a missile probably a bomb by isis and the west is acting
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:02:00.920]  like their feelings are hurt for russia this is a proxy army so where do you see this going
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.640]  we've got habu in wisconsin bill in wisconsin dug in minnesota rock in minnesota john in texas
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:16.920]  and others uh let's go ahead and talk to bill in wisconsin you're on the air bill thanks for calling
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.680]  yeah alex how you've been it's been a while since i've called in did you hear from him
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:32.360]  yeah uh and you played that information by the neocon uh john bolton i think we got a look at
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:40.760]  the total international picture here uh automatically the western nations are saying isis blew it up
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:52.360]  and that makes me suspicious okay uh i think we could have british intelligence i think we could
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:03:03.000]  have mosad i think we have a lot of players in this mix what bothers me about isis the most
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:17.000]  is that here we have a group of jihadi extremists that are attacking arab countries but are leaving
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:28.840]  israel completely off the radar now wouldn't you think that they would want to cause great harm
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:38.120]  to the state of israel and to the jews in the world and well sure but the saudi arabians
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:44.040]  basically run al qaeda and i system they're not attacking israel because saudi arabia is allied
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:52.120]  with israel and in the south and then the golon israel is actually backing syrian rebels that's
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:04:01.400]  that's that's on record it's despicable too so we we shouldn't automatically say okay isis did it
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:09.720]  when i think there's some strings being pulled in the background and of course you know myself in
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:17.480]  wisconsin i can't prove this but i get the same kind of sense having watched some of this
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:24.920]  over 30 40 years and that's all i'm saying well i think what you say is a hundred percent legitimate
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:30.200]  and should be investigated because all these governments whether it's israel england the
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:35.960]  united states have all been caught staging false flags and blaming it on people the difference is
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:42.840]  isis doesn't care if they get blamed they're already under attack they would have the motive
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:49.320]  to strike in russia to say leave us alone that's all i'm saying i don't think we know yet i think
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.800]  it's clear though that it didn't blow up on its own habu and others your calls are straight ahead

[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.760]  glorious steinem steinem claims the current backlash against plan parenthood is part of an
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:14.680]  ultra right-wing attempt to restore the basis of patriarchy a long-term racist system which
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:20.040]  is controlling reproduction and to control reproduction you have to control the bodies of

[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:32.760]  those social justice buzzwords plan parenthood was founded by a self-described racist founder

[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:46.120]  the negro population plan parenthood was founded to control the bodies of black women in order to

[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:45.320]  goes on the record good evening sir and you know maybe this is a wake-up call to putin about isis
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.600]  i mean you know this is a tack all their citizens much like our citizens got attacked they they've
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:57.000]  lost 244 we lost 3000 the same jihadis now he will see isis as the threat it is well i don't think
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.640]  he's ever doubted that isis is a threat let's pause back it up 10 seconds they invaded syria to
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:10.680]  take out isis i mean this is a total upside down inversion of reality we talk about here
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:18.200]  and she keeps saying it as a talking point this is who they put on television she's the type of
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:25.400]  prosecutor to put in some people in prison in my view and man is she an example of bad plastic
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:31.400]  surgery i'm not talking about how she looks but i mean who are these weird snapping turtle people
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:35.640]  maybe they're really aliens wearing rubber mask or something man it looks like she's wearing a rubber
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:42.040]  mask and i'm not just kidding how she looks but i mean what she says it's just why do you insult
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:47.480]  us but then i realize she's got a bunch of add old viewers drinking diet coke don't know what
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:54.520]  planet they're on go back to it just go back to it act they they've lost 244 we lost 3000
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:18:00.280]  but maybe now he will see isis as the threat it is what i don't think he's ever doubted that isis
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:06.280]  is a threat particularly deep inside russia itself they invaded over it his objective in syria was
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:12.520]  to bolster the Assad regime but if it turns out that isis is responsible for downing this plane
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:19.320]  that is the single biggest mistake they have ever made because putin now will retaliate and he won't
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:26.360]  mess around like president obama has done it will be uh i think extraordinarily massive and i think
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:31.080]  he needs to do that for a number of reasons including his domestic political calculus
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.640]  and then it just goes on from there we're three more times in four minutes
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:42.600]  i want to go to calls but they just continue on and on and on and come back go to hobo

[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.280]  the latest is they actually dummied up an article from info wars and reported on bill mar i have
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:28.600]  the video as if we actually said this i mean bill mar literally thinks his audience are idiots
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:39.720]  you know bill mar would get record ratings if i came on the show and he knows that
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.160]  they know that every show i go on is huge ratings big big national news he won't
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:53.480]  i'll tell him shut up with his pre-written lines and listen to reality i'd like to slap him

[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:16.280]  popping in then i'll go to dug and others habu in wisconsin you're on the air what's your take
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.280]  on the shootdown of the airliner which they now admit was an act of terrorism basically
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:28.760]  i thank you for the opportunity i believe that's correct and that's what i thought even before
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:37.960]  they mentioned it because of the way that the news came out but but but here's the important point
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:44.600]  you know when you look at the logistics around a plane meaning all these people coming as you
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:52.440]  alluded to earlier you know food service pack you know servicing it bring in all the luggage etc
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:25:01.320]  plus cleaning out the the the passenger area it is so easy to really smuggle you know kind of a
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:10.600]  bomb device in there and so by my way of thinking they don't even need you know these expensive
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:17.800]  shoulder missiles or or or something of that sort because they do have inside uh you know
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.960]  contacts with people and just think of it a guy who's making five hundred dollars a month
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:28.360]  and they give him a million dollar bounty you know it's it's very clear which way the person's
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:34.600]  going to go that's right and these uh radicals funded by different western intelligence agencies
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:40.760]  will do anything and they all have connections so so whether the west gave the orders to isis
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:45.320]  to do this or al-qaeda to do this and they're the prime suspects it doesn't matter the west
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:51.480]  helped build them up and let them reconstitute so they are basically guilty of it and i think
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.960]  that's why you see camera and others scrambling to distance themselves from this and act like
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.960]  they're all upset because they know that this is a major escalation and i think probably isis
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:09.000]  did this on their own what do you think uh you know you know we can call it isis but they have
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.520]  their networks just like you know this whole alternative currency network called howler
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:20.200]  where they can send money anyway in the world by by unorthodox means they have their contacts and
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:25.800]  you know for the right price people will do it but and and i'm i'm very glad that you said that
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:31.640]  we have built this up and look at the the fallout from this i mean the thousands of people going
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:36.840]  to europe i mean it's kind of inundating that civilization and not that these are bad people
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:43.320]  but this is not something that uh you know such a drastic change in such a short time by so many
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:48.760]  people is just deleterious to any destabilization program what do you think the in game is
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.120]  uh well the end game is chaos that is that is for sure the end game is for sure i mean i just
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:01.720]  had one more thing you know despite what bolton and all these neocon enablers say
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:09.560]  you know tootin and russia are quite measured um and they can't pick on mecca or you know some of
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:16.440]  the holy places in of islam to bomb i mean that that wouldn't be uh they couldn't do a quid pro core
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:23.560]  but but they're very measured and they'll take this but i think this is going to mean a lot of
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:29.240]  a loss of tourism wholesale for that region of the world and perhaps even other places well
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:33.560]  sure that's the sad part is it's only going to hurt the muslims and the arabs and the africans
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:38.840]  it's just these radical jihadi groups are just a scourge in the middle east it's a beautiful
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:45.000]  place it's been stable before and it's just been wrecked uh by the west funding these groups i mean
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.560]  the west is guilty to a great extent of this thank you for the call john in texas you're on the air
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:58.040]  thanks for holding hey alex hi you know you know the country you need to go visit is russia
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.440]  we really we really need to know what's going on in russia latimer putin really a reformer
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:07.800]  our church is open or people have more freedom you know i thought about that i next i also want to
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:15.480]  go to russia and investigate uh that for myself as well i agree and as far as the one guy said
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:19.880]  about the middle east that uh there's so many intelligence agencies over there and we were
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:26.040]  always blacking out backing all these uh arab groups that nobody knows for sure you know which
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:31.080]  what's really going on there i mean did the was that just a fringe muslim group that did it on
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:37.080]  her own or were they under direction of one of our intelligence agencies there's a lot of
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:41.960]  a lot of ifs but what's going on there you know but the message is clear uh salt arabia said we're
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:47.320]  going to start hitting you a year ago with terrorism soft targets if you don't back off in syria now
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:52.040]  it's happened so i think they're guilty just for what they said i mean if you say do this or
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:58.360]  i'm going to kill you and then that person gets killed who's the prime suspect well saudi's yeah
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:03.080]  saudi's are working for us though they're they're our boys no i totally agree and when we say working
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:08.760]  for us this isn't us doing this this is crazy criminals that have hijacked this country and
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:14.200]  are trying to put tranny bathrooms in elementary schools we are living in an insane asylum

[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:29.720]  again i'm not obsessing on trannies she said the obsession on trannies is a sign of our total decline
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:35.640]  our elites think they can go around messing with everybody all day and jack with our families and
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:40.360]  tell us what to eat and tell us how to have babies i mean it's just they're crazy get out of our

[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:37.160]  november 2015 now we've had so many requests people like to hear it live on the radio and not
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:42.840]  everybody's on the internet but i will re-air the matt drudge interview from a month ago when he
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:47.320]  just showed up in studio and revealed what he told us privately that he's a big superfan
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:54.600]  obviously he's linked to us today in some of our reports so it's a great interview it was in over
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:59.240]  500 newspapers that we know of it was all over national television it was really an informative
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:04.520]  interview on so many subjects it only gives an interview every few years that interview will re-air
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:09.240]  in the third hour then david night comes in with the fourth hour to host with all the latest breaking
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:16.280]  news and other intel now i'm very honored to have congressman former congressman and a medical
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:25.560]  doctor ron paul join us today ron paul joins us to talk about election 2016 and his view on where
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:33.720]  the libertarian patriot freedom movement is going and also a talk some about rand paul and what his
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.040]  strategy is there for the white house because this stuff can go back and forth he was the leader
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.520]  four months ago and then he got the middle of the pack now he's come back up some the media
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:49.320]  has tried to demonize him tried to try to ignore him the big tell is that they spend so much time
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:54.760]  attacking him and so much time trying to not give him enough time in the debates because they know
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:00.760]  that he actually has a real domestic and foreign policy and usually when ron paul comes on the elder
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:06.280]  he doesn't talk a lot about his son but today i'm told that he's happy to get into some of that so
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:12.200]  what should we tackle first mr paul dr paul there's so much to go over here where should we start
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.760]  well i think you touched on the most important thing you know i think they fear the truth that
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:23.720]  you're you're a victim of that too they don't put you on national news all the time when you try to
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:30.120]  get the truth out and when rand does you know he's excluded and you remember so clearly when
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:35.720]  you were giving us support you know four and eight years ago that uh they don't want to hear the truth
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:40.920]  because we're challenging him and it isn't like it's the democrats fault it's just as much the
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:45.720]  republicans because you know there is this tremendous coalition between the leadership of
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:52.840]  both parties you take for instance uh i think it dramatically uh illustrates how the two parties
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:58.760]  work when you see polosi and bainer working so hard to raise the debt and spending and claim
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:04.600]  you know the world would come to an end if we didn't do this so therefore if uh even if you're
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:11.000]  an independent democrat or an independent republican or an independent thinking person in the
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:18.280]  presidential race uh yes they have to do a lot to destroy that individual but uh hopefully we
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:24.680]  can overcome that because uh you know the truth is hard to destroy although uh they have a lot
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:33.080]  of tools that they can work us over on now i'm told today at rand paul dot com rand paul dot com
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:39.240]  folks can go there and find out about a new initiative uh to really try to get rand paul
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.960]  back up at the front of the line uh even though you didn't win your three runs for the presidency
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:50.520]  you know the one back in the uh eighties and then of course the two more recently it built a
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:55.800]  liberty movement now that has built the true libertarian tea party that's now challenging
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.160]  the neocons that you were just talking about and unseating people like bainer and almost getting
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:06.600]  an audit of the fed we've gone from you getting no co-sponsors 20 years ago to almost auditing the
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:14.440]  fed so clearly i see us as gaining ground and even if rand paul doesn't win supporting him donating
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:20.840]  uh spreading the word wins because he gets the word out but he actually has a shot he's been
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:26.440]  the front runner before we see people shoot back and forth uh i've seen the national polls as you
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:31.640]  know you've also got him uh he's one of the best candidates have not the best in an election with
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:36.760]  hillary that's my big concern some of these other candidates show well with republican voters
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:40.840]  because of their rhetoric but they just don't have the background to prove that they do what they
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.640]  say they'll do yeah they're too similar you know because they endorse the same foreign policy and
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.760]  rand is the only rand is the only one that has a different foreign policy but you know it's a real
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:58.600]  dilemma uh about the tea party movement because it's not it's not a monolith and you recall very
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:05.000]  well when it started and you know it started with our first campaign you started it on the original
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:12.920]  date of the of the tea party uh you know in in 07 i guess it was but you know when it became so
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:19.720]  popular and we tapped into how unhappy the people were very quickly the moneyed interest uh you know
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:26.120]  the pro-war people and the pro big government people they quickly usurped this they got in and
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:31.480]  got control of it and they blended it into you know the conventional republican message so
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:38.680]  there was a time early on when it was very very uh delineating with uh if you remember the tea party
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:43.560]  but right now you know if you if you bump into somebody so well i'm a but member of the tea party
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:48.920]  well i'd like to know what they believe in and so often they don't have the biggest idea of how it
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:54.840]  was started and what the original intent was in the tea party has lost its momentum but i don't
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:59.160]  think the ideas have lost the momentum the american people matter of fact in some ways
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:03.880]  i see that we have gained a lot i think the large majority american people aren't looking for another
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:09.320]  war and they don't trust obama on foreign policy i think now when you already mentioned the fed more
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:15.640]  people are concerned about the fed today than they've ever been uh i i just wish we could get this out
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:22.120]  and that's what uh i went ran to be able to do it to kind of kind of rack uh you know the media
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:27.880]  trying to exclude them is to get the uh get the issue of the monetary policy and the federal
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:33.640]  reserve out there as well as the as the foreign policy but even from the very first uh time he
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:39.320]  started campaigning for the senate uh his big issue has always been the debt and it's a it's a
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:44.680]  good item because debt represents big government if you can't have the debt if you can't monetize
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:50.040]  the debt you run out of borrowing you know the government has to has to collapse so far they
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:54.680]  the fed still has the credibility they can monetize debt and people are still behind the
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:59.560]  spending and the paul krugeman's of the world are still winning the day deficits don't matter
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:04.440]  but i'll tell you what i think the majority american people are waking up and it's been
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:10.680]  shows like yours and many others and the internet that has caused people to pay attention even though
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.880]  i can't identify and say oh what i want to be is the leader of the tea party movement and go and
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:20.760]  think that i'm going to get total response from them but there's a lot of people who don't say
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:25.960]  oh i'm a tea party person who endorsed many of the ideas that we've been talking about here
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:31.080]  especially these last five or six years well i should delineate that more myself because i was
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:35.720]  there when it spontaneously when you launched on that date began we call the tea party they were
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:41.400]  mad at the republicans and democrats they were libertarian constitutionalist paleo conservatives
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:47.080]  and the media admitted it was ron paul's tea party these crowds of five thousand ten thousand
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:53.160]  forty thousand fifty thousand or bigger and then they sit in the republicans they tried to take it
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:58.280]  over i think they've lost really completely co-opting it though they partially did i think
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:02.840]  there's a battle over the soul of it but i agree with you we don't stand or fall on the tea party
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:09.080]  but you see how the republican and democratic leadership when we get internal audio of their
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:14.920]  high-level fundraiser meetings they've circled the wagons to give money collectively to defeat
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:20.120]  campaign for liberty people to stop folks that are affiliated with you or sound like you
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:24.680]  and so i think it's important even though you're a humble man dr paul to talk about the fact that
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:31.160]  you really are the founder of what is the tea party and so i think people should listen to that
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:37.880]  and know where they came from it's not jane uh john bainer it's not paul ryan uh it's not people
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:43.720]  like newt genrich know they are the neocon rhinos that are the problem and they have attacked your
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:49.960]  son so much because they know his track record working with you working with others where he
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:55.080]  stood i mean i remember rand whenever i was trying to get you on my show when you were running for
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:42:00.680]  congress in like 1996 trying to get back in and you'd come on you'd gotten some support
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:04.680]  and then i got a call from the campaign saying well rand starting to do interviews that's his son
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:09.480]  can he come on so we can get some more critical votes because back then your district still came
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:14.920]  into the south of austin and i was on the radio in austin so i mean that's how long he's been fighting
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:19.880]  for the liberty movement and that's why i know we can trust him and that's why there's a money
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:26.440]  bomb today at rand paul dot com and folks especially if your middle class are wealthy if you're not
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:32.280]  giving money to libertarian patriot candidates and if you're not supporting uh really the guy
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.920]  that's carrying the torch for the campaign of liberty type movement that's been persecuted dirty
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:41.960]  tricks you name it you're crazy you can't ask people to run for congress or run for senate or
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:47.320]  run for president and then not support them and uh you know usually it's poor people end up giving
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.600]  money to folks it needs to be the middle class if you don't vote with your dollars and if you
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:57.320]  don't vote with your mouth and vote with writing letters to the editor if you don't get aggressive
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:02.600]  we're going to lose this country so i want to see a lot of people go to rand paul dot com today
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:07.720]  and to donate so that we can continue to have him out there in the debates on the campaign trail
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:12.840]  and there is a good chance he can vault back to number one and could beat hillary in a general
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:18.600]  election i i want to want to uh sorry ron paul go ahead i was i was gonna say you you stayed
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:24.760]  it well because i i've never been real good at uh calling up a person say hey how about donating
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:29.880]  money somebody told me once don't approach this thing that they're donating money because in
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:34.840]  reality we should be asking people to invest their money it's not like they're donating money to ron
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:41.240]  paul or ran paul i mean this this is expensive and to compete with either the very wealthy candidates
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:46.600]  are to compete with uh you know the establishment parties and you know this is a war acts a huge
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:51.480]  yeah it's a war our founders gave all their treasure their blood their families we're not
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:55.560]  going to save the republic without giving blood sweat tears and money that's what i'm getting at
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:03.960]  that of course is uh you know i i think the telltale of this campaign is going to uh
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:08.840]  be decided here and within the next month or so and and we're hoping that this money bomb is going
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:15.560]  to be uh you know very instrumental but you know even with the less funds that he's had uh the
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:20.600]  organization is still working very hard on the same tactics that i use and that is get to the
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:26.200]  college campuses and you know uh there's a bunch of young people who are out there and it's sort
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:31.000]  of under the radar you don't hear you know they wouldn't give us credit and say you know he has
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.680]  10 000 young people organized to go out and and round up the votes no they don't want to do that
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:42.760]  but uh and like he says you know uh these people who come around and say all right you you're not
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:46.920]  rating high enough why don't you just quit he says well they at least had ought to have the chance to
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:52.680]  vote how can you maybe maybe the people are orchestrating this well you better just drop out
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:59.560]  are the ones who are fearful that he might stay in and uh but he still have to prove that do we
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:06.360]  have the funds to get out to vote and score uh in the early primaries undoubtedly there's been a lot
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:11.160]  of dirty tricks in the media attempts to shoot him down i know you don't like to get a lot of
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:15.320]  attention to that but that's the proof that somebody's the person to support when the
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:22.120]  establishments coming after him i've never heard rand paul say that he loves hillary clinton i've
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:26.920]  never heard him say he's for an assault weapons ban i have heard that out of donald trump people
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:32.920]  are in love with donald trump's rhetoric i'm just concerned that uh there may be a double cross
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:40.440]  going on here yeah and and unfortunately you know hit the popularity there might get things
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:45.400]  moved along and then when you just ever the double cross but you know that's sort of typical of most
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:51.000]  politicians they say one thing and they fool and deceive the people then they get in uh just just
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:57.160]  think of uh obama running as the peace candidate you know in heck he's going to have more wars
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:02.600]  going on than he inherited and they were bad enough already so but they but they're able to deceive
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:08.200]  the people and uh that's uh that's the reason why we have to be able to get a message out
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.760]  well i totally agree with you in the few minutes we have left speaking of war
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.320]  rand paul was the first to expose that we were becoming al-qaeda's air force in syria
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:20.280]  to say no to it then ted cruise jumped on the bandwagon to his credit uh and then expanding on
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:26.120]  all of that then the media turns around and goes rand paul's not tough on isis when rand paul senator
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:33.000]  paul from the beginning tried to stop the whole war from happening it's just the incredible ignorance
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:39.320]  uh of some of the voting public sometimes about geopolitical issues and then separately the
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:44.280]  russian airliner getting blown up i'm concerned russia's being sucked into a new afghanistan
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:53.240]  uh that that's very well could be the case and uh i i'm afraid of the escalation whether it's
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:47:00.680]  our our involvement there and even the russians involvement i know they have a easier justification
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:05.080]  the fact that they have a base and a treaty and they've been invited in there by the government
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:11.800]  is one thing but still uh there's too much room for air what's going on over there because nobody
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:17.560]  knows uh uh you know what's going on i was thinking the other day about the the old song about who's
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:23.800]  on first you know the avalanche costello yeah who's on first is who's in charge who's the enemy
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:29.080]  and and because it's absolute chaos you know and again obama just announced they were going to drop
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:35.320]  more weapons then for the isis faction or the al-qaeda faction or whatever that they like
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:40.920]  and they don't know what's in the man the moon because it ends up usually being used against us
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:45.480]  what do you make of putin coming out and saying man made global warming is nothing but a global
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:50.280]  government tax to wreck nation states now the hungarian prime ministers come out and said the
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:57.000]  treasonous conspiracy to marginalize nation states opening their borders more and more i mean i read
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.120]  the russian news every day it sounds like it's libertarian or something that's really scary
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:09.640]  when the foreign press sounds more americana than america yeah that is a little bit scary and then
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.360]  then you always get blamed and of course you get blamed for a lot of things as i do but then but you
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:20.200]  do this and then they accuse you of uh you you hate america you're unamerican you're in all that
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:26.760]  nonsense you're against the troops and yet there's so often you come up with uh you know
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:34.200]  some points that uh putin makes but uh it it never distracts from my position that the founders
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:42.040]  were correct in staying out of these entangling alliances you know if if uh if if russia and
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:48.200]  putin is not uh moving in the direction that we think and hope uh then they have to deal with that
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:53.000]  they're going to mess with uh will be nothing automatic they're going to mess with afghanistan
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.840]  we never even learned any lesson about that but uh i think it's their area of the world you know
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:05.560]  we'd be can you imagine what we'd be like if the chinese and the russians and we're on the borders
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:13.240]  of uh of mexico i mean crazy uh we would we would be pretty much outraged but you know i think nato
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:20.600]  is one of the most ordinary organizations because uh putin is more or less uh uh counteracting the
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:25.800]  aggressiveness of nato nato is the one that's putting these missiles right up on their borders and
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:32.840]  getting his stern throw up in ukraine so uh i you know and i i always remember back when uh
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:39.000]  robert taft uh advised we not even get into nato that it would involve us in boggastown
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:45.480]  and in europe and i think that's exactly what has happened well rand paul dot com a money bomb going
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:51.000]  on right now and it is so important to have rand paul in this race uh we've got to keep him in there
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.960]  for the long haul so it's important to donate ladies and gentlemen it is an investment it is
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:01.960]  war bonds and if we don't resist we know we're going to lose if we don't give up uh then we know
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:06.040]  when the m are going to win because what we're promoting is freedom what we're promoting is the
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:11.320]  answer to all this tyranny we're coming close to the financial implosion uh more and more people
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:16.200]  are waking up i mean in closing we got 30 seconds look at the pope calling for world government mr paul
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:20.360]  i mean it is just a wild time where everything we've talked about is pretty much coming true
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:27.560]  yeah and i think that every single day that you can see this and uh yet the deception continues
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:33.160]  you know but it it is going to be the confidence factor which is a subjective factor when the
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:38.600]  confidence is lost in us in trust in them in america trust in our military or trust in our dollar
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:47.240]  this thing comes unravel rather quickly it is and it won't be uh stoppable and uh it's a house of
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:52.520]  cards and i think uh you're absolutely right we're approaching that rather rapidly dr paul godspeed

[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:43.240]  air worldwide what's your take on this plane the russian airliner okay thanks alix um i think if it
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:51.640]  was brought down by a bomb uh we should consider that it was a false flag intended to blame i said
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:58.920]  but uh committed by putin i think you have to look at the russian staging false flags they've
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:05.720]  done it before absolutely yeah they've done it before in 1999 the apartment building in moscow
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:11.240]  they didn't catch moscow moscow going in sorry go ahead and tell folks what they did yeah that was
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:18.120]  the main justice that was the main justification for them going into church now and uh you know
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:22.840]  that was the only way they could have uh justified going in there and all the tens of thousands that
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:29.560]  the russians lost and i think that putin knew from day one that he'd probably have to go in
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:37.480]  to syria on the ground um and you know syrian army and hezbollah are suffering quite heavy losses
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:42.840]  at the moment and i you know i heard that the iranians had lost in the senior officers that
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:48.360]  five of them and i think there's only so much they can do from the air they can hold the line
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:53.880]  sort of thing and they might risk losing the east to the kerb depending on what goes on there
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:59.560]  so they might need to go in quite heavily on the ground so it's possible that the only way
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:07.720]  that they could do that uh is to have this this sort of outrage you know i said that earlier i
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:12.680]  said could it be a false flag uh but then ices doesn't even do stuff that's good for them it's
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:17.640]  bad for ices to blow up the plane if they did it they have taken credit but that could be a russian
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.120]  cutout uh you've got a good point i don't think we know because all these governments do false
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:26.920]  flags then then there's the maccivelian argument well good russia kills 224 of its own people
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:32.520]  so thousands don't die from an ices invasion and that way leads to hell that way is mortaur
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:38.120]  that way is absolutely injustifies the means garbage thank you tom interesting point back in 70

[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:11.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:20.920]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.240]  dove in menace shadow thanks for holding her on the air welcome
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:39.880]  how you doing good brother hey i was looking up this uh as far as uh the militia act in 1903
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:47.320]  which basically prohibits anyone from removing the second amendment or changing it in any way
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:54.600]  uh is that do you know anything about that i am familiar with it haven't read it probably a decade
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:01:00.120]  but uh the second amendment creates a militia and says everybody should be armed and that's
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:03.880]  just like switzerland and clearly it's it's it's about individual ownership of firearms
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:11.160]  yep i was just wondering if that was enough firepower to keep anybody from going to the
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:17.000]  no i mean there's laws against forcibly inoculating people there's there's laws against uh all sorts
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.960]  of things they just ignore or they write a new law that doesn't supersede the bill of rights
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:31.480]  but yeah look laws only go so far you have to enforce them and the laws we have are being
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:37.000]  trampled with all these new regulations and things that aren't laws at all dug well that
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:42.760]  that's it you know and i i'm kind of surprised at all the constitutional lawyers the the top
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:48.040]  ones don't get together and just start hitting at the bottom i mean people are talking about
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:54.920]  well take obama to court no start lower for the people you can prosecute and they'll sing like
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:59.800]  birds absolutely and then it's a chain reaction great point absolutely shouldn't shoot for such
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:04.680]  high targets sometimes go for the low hanging fruit charlene in pennsylvania thanks for holding
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:13.720]  her on the air hi alex um i think if i was puny i would go after malik obama that would cut off
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:21.560]  the money line to isis because where's our tax dollars going we know that that's a front for
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:28.440]  isis who's funding the terrorist are our taxpayer dollars if i was puny i would go after malik it
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:34.440]  stopped the chain of money boom well yeah if russia starts suing obama's family members that are
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:37.800]  tied to the muslim brotherhood that it could be tied to this bombing if it's not a false flag
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:46.920]  then that could start a chain reaction just the pr alone of russia suing obama uh is priceless but
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:53.560]  russia could have done this to legitimize being in syria but they've been playing it pretty clean
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:58.200]  i just don't know i mean i'm not going to get up here and say we definitively know i think more
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:03.080]  will come out charlene great points thanks for the call davin pennsylvania you're on the air welcome
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:09.320]  yes thank you alex for having such fine gifts like dr group dr wallach farmer suspend fuchs

[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:20.760]  and beyond tangy tangerine every day well thank you sir and uh the reason why i'm calling i've
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:26.440]  noticed that in this politically correct environment that we're now being forced to live under that no
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:32.360]  one has made a big fuss over the holiday or after thanksgiving the big shopping day black friday
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:36.280]  yeah they haven't done that because the court everybody knows black means you're you're doing
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:40.920]  you're making money and red means you're you're not making money but no i would expect they'll in
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:45.320]  fact we should send somebody out and have them we should send lian or somebody out and say here
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:49.400]  we have a petition to ban the term black friday because it's hurtful if you do it at a major
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:55.240]  university nine out of ten folks will say ban it i guarantee it oh this is nothing more than another
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:59.880]  contrived attack on our first amendment to uh you know twist everything around upside down
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:04.760]  backward you know you turn this into to be the most illiterate nation on the face of the earth
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:09.480]  well that's how you screw people up i mean now the epa came out and said restrict pumpkins
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.000]  because they're hurting the earth because there's carbon dioxide i mean this is just baloney
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:20.600]  let i'll go with that 40 global warming garbage if anyone does any research check out some spot
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:26.600]  activity that is the main key driver right and it's low so we're getting cold get more sun spots
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:31.400]  that means mass coronal ejections huge fireball shooting out towards us things get hotter i mean
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:36.600]  it's everybody knows you go out that noon in july and a clear day you get burned you go out in the
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:41.640]  winter at noon you don't get burned because you know we're we're tilted towards the sun it's hot
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:48.360]  that's what drives it conspiracy theorists by the way after the drudge interview we're going to have
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:54.840]  david night live with bill marr attacking uh so much more land's got a big report it's all coming up
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:58.920]  please tell your friends and family to tune in because they don't want you listening russia
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:02.920]  and egypt still refuse to acknowledge that a terrorist attack could have taken down a russian
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:09.000]  jet plane but that's not stopping neocon warmonger john bolton to lick his chops at the prospect of
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:15.560]  russian retaliation if it turns out that isis is responsible for downing this plane that is the
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:21.640]  single biggest mistake they have ever made because prudent now will retaliate and he won't mess around
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:28.760]  like president obama has done it will be uh i think extraordinarily massive us and uk intelligence
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:33.160]  officials are up the belief that a bomb took down the plane but the president has remained silent
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:38.200]  on the cause of the disaster one source tells the dc whispers website that there are concerns that the
[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:43.240]  muslim brotherhood is responsible for the terror attack the muslim brotherhood has enjoyed close
[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:48.040]  ties with the administration in the past and the source suggests measures are being taken by
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:53.880]  administration officials to make certain no such connection if in fact it exists will become part

[02:08:54.680 --> 02:09:08.840]  mean kill the matrix is a system neo that system is our enemy when you're inside you look around

[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:27.560]  them our enemy has to understand most of these people are not ready to be unplugged and many of
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:33.240]  them are so inert so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it

[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.680]  welcome to the real world
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:11.320]  all right folks alex jones here back live well into the third hour i did not do this as a stunt
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.880]  neither did matt rudge he is here we got a hot mic over there he wants to stay literally in the
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:21.800]  shadows behind a curtain but this is the king of being able to push the story out and make it the
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:26.360]  number one story in the world they even admit that in the new york times that he has more readers
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:32.120]  on politics and news than facebook the new york times and the washington post la times put together
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:37.480]  he's got some of our stories where the shooter himself said he was on a bunch of drugs he's linked
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:42.440]  to that today and that's the story they don't want out there or the story we're seeing in took a
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:47.320]  mixed racial christian hater and turned him into a right-wing white supremacist and turned him white
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:52.520]  they don't want people knowing that but matt drudge and his great crew can link to alternative
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:59.240]  stories foreign stories mainstream stories photos mugshots and really just focus on what matt drudge
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:04.440]  thinks is interesting and the public tends to agree with him that what he focuses in on is really
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:09.880]  catching the zeitgeist or the pulse of the people so he might have 50 links every day
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:16.440]  where facebook has 500 million but he has more traffic that is the true david versus goliath
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:22.600]  story and this is not scripted i have no idea where i should go matt drudge i guess you're here
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:28.600]  for acl or why are you in austin texas well you were just talking about facebook and thanks again
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:35.960]  for having me here i'm not on facebook i don't do the socials i've got that little twitter thing
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:40.840]  even that's kind of disgusting you know i've been doing the internet as long as you've been doing
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:46.360]  this radio show alex literally every day as you have literally every day practically i think you've
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:50.600]  taken a little more time off than i have actually yes i've kind of and i can't say that about many
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:57.400]  people because you are a peer without peer and i'll tell you i was there before facebook i was
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:06.360]  there before cnn.com i was there before mostly all of them i have a very clear perception what the
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:15.640]  internet is in my mind i'm free i'm not defined by what they say the internet is uh meaning goldman
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:21.000]  sacks meaning who they invest in for the latest startup meaning the latest buzz feed or salon or
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:28.200]  gawker all well gawker is more independent but there's a lot of corporate makeover of the internet
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:35.000]  that i have not adapted to simply put i'm friends with some of them when i go to new york i make
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:41.720]  the sixth avenue rounds but i am not a part of that system i am a free thinker i'm an american
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:51.480]  i'm very concerned with what's happening so i just give them my all i've learned how to take
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:59.000]  care of myself and detach from outcomes because otherwise you can't survive and i don't know
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.080]  where you are on that topic that's i just follow my instinct because they always tell us how to
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:08.840]  adapt to be successful but really we're just adapting to their mindset i don't i don't know you
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:18.920]  don't i have remained completely independent from all of them all of them i am not influenced by any
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:26.040]  of them i need no traffic from google i don't care if i get one traffic referral referral from google
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:31.880]  or bing or yahoo or any of these others it's always been that way now if you think of that
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:39.240]  set up how rare that is because everybody's so hungry for referrals for likes i don't need to
[02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:43.800]  be liked i don't need to be liked at all i don't care if there's a button right there at the top
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:50.120]  of drudge saying like or dislike thumbs up thumbs down doesn't mean anything now i hope that you
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:55.640]  come doesn't mean you necessarily have to like what i have up there now where i've had a lot of
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:15:00.120]  successes i'm getting people from both sides of the aisle they've always said always a right-wing
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:04.120]  gossip monger mainly because of lawinsky in those years which by the way are back
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:10.760]  why aren't we seeing hillary's lovers excuse me why aren't we seeing hillary's lovers it's good
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:18.200]  question where's the cover-up on this so many issues that are suppressed on a daily basis
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:24.040]  so that's what i try to do every morning incredible well it's amazing to have you here
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:29.960]  in austin texas and i tell you you certainly know how to make an entrance i'm in a 70 second break
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:37.320]  and i turn around and there's matt drudge just boom i tell you i almost had a heart attack a good
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:42.040]  one my cousin said he's never seen me look like that what was the word buckley you used
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:49.720]  and i was flabbergasted i was flabbergasted you use the word flabbergasted well i i tell you this
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:54.200]  is like the biggest christmas present early ever because i just admire true independence
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:57.960]  and i gotta tell you matt and you know this with your crew and congress knows this we wouldn't
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:02.840]  have won some of these gun battles some of these border battles some of these energy battles and
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:06.840]  we've lost some too but we would have lost so many of them if it wasn't for the focal point
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:10.120]  and even the white house and the democrats admit because i know you're saying you're
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:13.880]  non-partisan i mean i would guess you're more of a libertarian if i'm wrong you're just a freedom
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:21.800]  guy i can't be controlled i cannot be controlled there are no interests here but what i see as the
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:28.120]  world events period that is the truth of the situation well they hate the fact that they can't
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:33.800]  control the agenda the pentagon has briefings with the head of syops as you know saying we've
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:39.080]  got to stop drudge changing the subject and showing when we're lying i mean that's when you know
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:44.040]  that's i mean that's crazy town when you get what is it like is it surreal to think back to something
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.600]  you started back in the early 90s has now grown into this well no because it's been every day so
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:54.360]  it just like it's it's happened so organically it started with one reader i don't know who that
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:17:00.840]  one reader was but it started with one reader i've never placed an ad anywhere ever this has all
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:06.760]  been a true organic reader to reader to reader to reader yes i dabbled in the corporate with
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:12.600]  the fox news show and the clear channel a clear channel radio show for nine years but even that
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:19.480]  the website was on its own terms and remains so to this very many you've only gotten bigger since
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:24.840]  you stopped i don't know because this is another thing what the measurements that we have this
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:31.720]  is another bogus thing yesterday they released on the ap a wire twitter followers hillary is the
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:36.600]  queen of the twitters with 4.9 million they don't say how many are fake they don't have
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:41.160]  this how many are they admit the first ladies is like 80 percent the ap did not do that alec so
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:47.240]  this whole thing this whole socials these socials you know beats one music which i'm obsessed with
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:51.480]  which has been launched on apple uh which is probably one of the best things they've done
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:57.960]  since steve jobs died one radio station interesting they don't know how many listeners they have i
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:04.440]  heard some streams they were down to five thousand an hour this whole social media stuff is bogus
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:11.880]  facebook we have two billion users this is garbage this is designed to demoralize
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:18.040]  the individual i'll never have two billion followers the internet is what you make of it
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:22.120]  it's the same battle as it was in the beginning i remember having this argument with brit humans
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:27.720]  live on c-span he goes oh the internet's all ufo's and uh all this crap and i said no the internet
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:32.120]  is what you make of it in the beginning they were dismissing the internet they were poo pooing it
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:36.520]  and isn't that good for us that that that for so long they were in arrogant denial
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.000]  and they seem like they still kind of are in arrogant denial no now they make it over in
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:50.200]  their image now it's these endless monotonous tweets meaningless meaningless uh to me it's
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:57.800]  just a lot of gnats a lot of confusion when the reality of the situation is life on earth has not
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:05.640]  changed we need facts we need events we need specifics on things not all this confusion it's
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:10.040]  almost they've made the internet over in their image these corporations and i think they're
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:14.680]  failing play break skip the break oh sorry matt go ahead i didn't interrupt you say you think
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:20.200]  they're failing i think they're failing to the point this is a whole nother discussion on how
[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:24.680]  sick are the american people right now i've been saying they could put hillary clinton's brain
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:30.680]  in a jar in the oval office and she'd be elected people are really sick i think you know this deep
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:36.040]  in your soul and this is why you get demoralized here on this very set i shouldn't people are sick
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:44.120]  how they've got here you've been on a wonderful arc over almost decades now explaining why people
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:51.080]  are and have become so sick that being said people are willing to be made over in the image of these
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:57.000]  corporations the reason there's so much anger online also is the newspaper like the washington
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:01.880]  post will leave a comment section they don't care what you're saying they don't care what you're
[02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:08.760]  thinking that's why you get these anger that oh i i have to be you know i'm out here as a citizen
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:14.280]  and i'm operating on in their playground make your own playground the reason i'm here alex is you've
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:22.680]  made your own playground this is a figment of your imagination and the drudger port is mine
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:30.760]  it is a very simple thesis you are what you dream you are and become and i wish americans would get
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:37.960]  out of the sickness and just become greater and well that's profound i mean because if we start
[02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:42.840]  creating our own maps our own world our own vision then there's no way for these cultural
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:48.200]  tyrants to program us and that's why they're pushing so hard to get more outrageous i mean
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:55.160]  is this the beginning of the end and to operate in their playgrounds so you become famous on youtube
[02:20:56.040 --> 02:21:00.440]  that's ridiculous i'm not saying you i'm saying the 13 year old that just died that they're saying
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:07.000]  is the first youtube star that died you're playing in google's help it no i agree but i think they
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:14.840]  did own place make your own the internet allows you to make your own dynamic your own universe
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:21.080]  why are you gravitating towards somebody else's universe and this is kind of again we're dredged
[02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:28.440]  to me when i look at it right now is a correction to this groupthink that has i totally agree with
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:33.240]  what you're saying there's no difference from any of these websites you go up and down we talk about
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:39.880]  this what's the difference between the websites between a slate or a salon or a buzzfeed or a
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:46.760]  huff but what is the difference there isn't any and this is a travesty it's almost like it's almost
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:54.280]  like a weird conglomerate of groupthink that has developed in a dynamic era that should be vibrating
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:22:00.680]  it should be vibrating it should be controversial but i guess it's fear uh i think not everybody
[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:06.840]  is cut from the same genetic background as you or i alex of being brave and being able to stand
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:12.760]  up you're on the camera i'm not you're more brave than i am so this is the dynamic that i mean i
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:19.480]  would just like to wake people up stop operating in their playground stop it well let me say this i
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:24.920]  totally agree with you i've tried i couldn't pay for the bandwidth to put all of our videos out on
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:30.040]  our own platforms now we're doing that uh at prisonplanet.tv and the nightly news and putting
[02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:33.720]  ourselves you know up on television to reach people because it's kind of like jacking into
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:38.760]  the matrix going into their playground i try to then claw them over here to see what we're trying
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:43.960]  to do what you're trying to do but i totally agree with you the answer is for all of us to create
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:50.680]  our own systems our own ideas because vibrant independent ideas will trump this corporate
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:56.520]  plastic borg this this this brainwashing they're trying to push i mean banning father and mother
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:23:01.080]  uh banning you know the word husband and wife i mean that's so cultic that if i'd have been told
[02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:05.800]  ten years ago they were going to ban words like that i wouldn't have believed it they do it with
[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:10.760]  straight faces i mean it has the left and of course the controlled right as well but have
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:17.000]  they gone collectively insane on on a control freak bent well i would urge astratum i would also
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:22.680]  or advise people to not waste their time on this i had a supreme court justice tell me to my face
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:28.920]  it's over for me said mad it's over for you they've got the votes now to enforce copyright law
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:32.600]  you're out of there they're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines
[02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:39.080]  to have a supreme court justice say that to my face that it's over they've got the votes
[02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:46.440]  which means time is limited time is not forever how many more moons and sunrises will you see in
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:53.240]  your life uh rise and fall there's not that many it's a small amount so for people to be saying
[02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:59.240]  with this attitude oh i'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime no no you can't we're
[02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:05.480]  being enslaved now and that's it under the tpp they admit you can't put a headline to the new
[02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:11.640]  york times you're sending massive traffic to them they're claiming you're taking their words this
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:16.440]  is insane and you had the justice steven bryer said we need to look at a global law now member
[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:20.920]  just recently getting lined up with it so they're getting ready for these decisions to come you
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:25.240]  thought obama care was shocking you thought some of these other decisions were shocking wait until
[02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:32.600]  these copyright laws work their way up and the supreme court decides you cannot have a website
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:39.160]  with news headlines linking across the board then that will end for me fine i've had a hell of a
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:44.280]  run is 20 years next year we're 20 years about now hell of a run i couldn't i couldn't have gone
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:51.000]  any further farther i feel completely i have gone as far out of the galaxy as i can on this i still
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:56.360]  want to stay out here but i've gone pretty damn far for what one individual can do in this culture
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:25:02.360]  but i'm talking about the future so i don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:09.800]  into these little ghettos of these facebook's and these tweets and these instagrams these instas this
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:15.720]  is ghetto this is ghetto this is corporate they're taking your they're taking your energy
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:19.480]  they're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return nothing they're dumbing the
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:24.440]  language down twitter's designed to reduce the language directly out of 1984 it's in shock
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:30.120]  right ultimately it's boring and the kids are always off to something new except for the
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:35.080]  something new is owned by the same freaking company or financed by the same banking system
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:41.160]  so i'm here to say and this is the reason why i came to see you alex you are one of the very few
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:47.880]  who are operating under this this under this theory to be an independent american in a as in a big
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:54.680]  way if your calling is media fine if your calling is sports whatever it is but you've got to be the
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:01.400]  greatest you can be now now before this country is so completely fractured and we're left with
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:07.880]  hillary's brain in the oval office in a jar because that's what we're getting she's old and she's
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:13.160]  sick she's not a contender they're making her a contender with these propped up saturday night
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:18.280]  live things it's like a head on a stick and then on the today's show with the gun three
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:25.320]  a head on a stick she is not a viable vibrant leader for this country of 300 including the
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:33.560]  illegals 380 million americans so the media is trying to put us to sleep you're not letting
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:38.760]  them alex i asked her this question man yeah is the establishment which we know is diverse but
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:43.320]  there's different conglomerates is it panicking is it trying to push everything through right now
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:49.080]  because it knows people are waking up or is it just completely arrogant and thinks it's invincible
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:55.560]  it's trying to consolidate control yes and there is a sense of panic about it you look at a
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:27:00.440]  telemundo or a univision they're kind of panicked you look at some of these interviews that are
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:07.240]  happening this election cycle where trump comes along says a few things just a few things and soars
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:14.360]  to the top of the list that's profound imagine if we actually had a good selection of candidates who
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:19.160]  are saying a lot and i know crews and rand and all the rest however you've got to be dynamic in
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:24.280]  this atmosphere and it's a media country you've got to be dynamic in media that's the only thing
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:31.400]  that's going to work so i am left with thinking there's not a lot of time to be your greatest self
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:38.520]  especially online because i don't if it continues to get consolidated to this degree and then we're
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:44.280]  moving into the robots which you're so profound on and it's going to get really ugly really fast
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:49.800]  there's already automated news sites google news hello anybody they actually the idiots reading
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:55.880]  that crap think there is actually a human there there is no human there you are being programmed
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:02.520]  to being automated even up to your news and apple news i don't know what that's about that was also
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:09.400]  creepy a same corporate glaze over everything i don't see the world that way i live in a world
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:15.960]  that's free colorful vibrant takes chances bold stands up to power and that's where i've made my
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:23.640]  success well very eloquently said i mean really if we don't affect the battle space if we don't get
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:28.360]  involved in free speech now that's all you the listeners all the drudge fans fans of freedom
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:32.280]  no matter what color you are no matter what political ban we're going to lose everything
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:36.680]  we know what the totalitarian looks like we know what oppression looks like we know what the dumb
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:44.040]  culture of of totalitarianism smells like this is it it's happening now and the future of the
[02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:48.760]  world is being decided so get out there make your own sides take action because matt you say you'll
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:53.000]  just go away if they do this we all know we're going to fight it we know they can't enforce it
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.800]  because if they can say that you can't even put a link up to a news site then that ends
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:02.200]  free speech and basic communication i mean i know they got the democrats out openly saying
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.560]  we need to bring in the fairness doctrine to the internet because of matt drudge because you
[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:10.760]  quote affect elections well you're an american citizen that pays taxes and you're allowed to
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:15.480]  be programmed well but if they get enough sick people to elect it the demographics will take
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:20.120]  care of themselves we had a story this morning that they're finally releasing an artist in cuba
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:28.200]  who painted raul and cat and a fidel as a pig jailed without trial for 18 months look at germany
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:31.400]  where they're arresting people that criticize open borders look you've been so it's already
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:38.120]  happening i i'm just warning this country that yes don't get into this false sense that you are an
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:45.240]  individual when you're on facebook no you're not you're a pawn in their scheme stay there we gotta
[02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:50.840]  come right back for a few more minutes and say bye this is incredible the empires on the run alex
[02:29:50.840 --> 02:30:02.200]  jones and the gcn radio network almost immediately following the crash of russian metro jet flight
[02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:08.520]  92 68 a militant group affiliated to isis in egypt claimed responsibility however many groups
[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:13.800]  including russian officials express their initial skepticism that isis could achieve such a thing
[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:19.880]  well now according to us officials an isis bomb is the most likely reason behind the russian jet
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:26.680]  crash that killed 224 people an official said there is a definite feeling it was an explosive

[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:33.560]  well i tell you a lot of energy in the building there's already a lot of energy in this building
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:41.240]  a lot of smiles with matt drudge here a don i guess went to the door and we said don't let
[02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:47.560]  strangers in but it was no stranger a matt drudge here in studio with us and characteristically uh
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:53.400]  very uh kind of like peter pan hard to hard to catch hard to find moves quick he is right over
[02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:58.520]  there in the dark with a handheld microphone of course the conspiracy theories will begin this
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:02.520]  isn't really matt drudge but people can tell it is matt drudge i've seen a lot of his speeches
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:07.000]  hurting pop in on shows here and there and it's always eloquent always thought-provoking this is
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:12.120]  particularly thought-provoking and will be a big newsmaker they will attempt to control reality
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:17.320]  and say how dare matt drudge hang out with that heretic alex jones and we're always hearing
[02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:21.480]  of the last six seven years that matt drudge is over matt drudge doesn't exist but then they have
[02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:26.280]  to admit matt drudge is bigger than ever so this attempt to control reality or control
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:32.120]  who talks to who by these totalitarians that masquerades liberals i don't think is working
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:37.560]  and now with bainer being forced out i think it shows the rumblings of the tea party beneath the
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:43.160]  surface so matt before you leave us and i really appreciate your time uh oh and by the way the
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:47.560]  presidential candidates that's exactly what you're saying the rumblings look at anybody
[02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:54.280]  who has any form of success in the polls is because they rumble uh where it's going to end up i don't
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:59.800]  know i'm very pessimistic i'm very pessimistic on this race because i'm just not so sure it's not
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:05.640]  going to end up with the dreaded brain in the in the jar in the oval office once known as hillary
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:12.600]  clinton who is hypothyroid anybody who is 70 years old who's hypothyroid you do not elect president
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:18.040]  ladies and gentlemen you don't do it now they'll say well it has to be who her vp is whether it's
[02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:23.000]  the castro from san antonio or the other castro from san antonio or the other castro from san
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:31.240]  antonio whoever it's going to be i i just shaking now after seeing nbc giving her endless hours of
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:38.600]  airtime over the past 72 hours at hillary's back and she's back for real now what that means to you
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:43.640]  were me what it means to me i've got a long history with these people they're ugly they played dirty
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:48.280]  they sued me for 30 million dollars last time around with the approval of the president announced
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:54.200]  by the press secretary of the white house a civil action these people and they didn't have the nsa
[02:35:54.200 --> 02:35:59.480]  then they had echelon and all these other things you were talking about even then hillary clinton
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:07.720]  with the nsa good luck if you dissent good luck if you dissent snowden i'll switch places with you
[02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:12.360]  you can come over here in rotten hell because that's what it's going to be so i'm very concerned
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:18.120]  with the lay of the land but the rumblings you're talking about that we've seen a trump that we've
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:25.640]  seen a carly that do we see in a sanders yeah maybe also old old can the democrats find anybody
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:31.480]  under the age of 70 what is this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:38.120]  new century so i don't know i i'm hoping for surprises i'm hoping for some jolts we'll have
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:44.760]  to see on a few other subjects and i appreciate your time i'm quit bugging you there's so much
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:49.560]  going on in the world obama now is talking about well australia had a good plan we may have to do
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:55.400]  that that's clearly talking about gun confiscation now hillary's doing it cnn's has pundits just
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:37:00.360]  saying let's just take them do these people realize that this is the line in the sand at the alamo
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.920]  if they really come out in the frontal assault on guns it means i think they're trying to start a
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:11.720]  civil war it just seems like insanity i mean they may think that they're stalling or something
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:17.800]  well because they're all armed themselves or they all have that security around them themselves
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:24.200]  they don't have to worry about i challenge hillary take away your secret service take it away now
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:30.440]  now take away your secret service dismiss them have no security around you have no guns around
[02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:37.880]  you hillary i dare you i dare you obama same thing drop your guns obama take your secret
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:44.040]  service away obama take it all away leave the white house unguarded obama let everybody
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:48.440]  know there's no guns on the white house grounds obama you know what would happen in 30 seconds
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:55.560]  both of those people would no longer be on planet earth so they're asking us to drop our guns and
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:02.840]  to drop our security measures or or what so this thing is very real and i don't see how it's being
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:08.760]  taken seriously except for the sick voter you can underestimate the sickness of the american people
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:13.720]  right now they're really sick and that's to me i'm more angry at the sick americans than i am at
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:19.080]  obama or hillary i'm really angry at the sick americans matt drudge i used to listen to your
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:24.600]  radio show almost every sunday but i got to tell you you are even more on fire than you were then
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:28.920]  and i know you're smart you know not to be you know you know too available because uh
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:34.280]  distance makes the heart grow find and i tell you about it would be great if even once a week you
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:38.680]  did like an hour podcast or something or maybe once a month with these thoughts because let me tell
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:44.200]  you this is some really good radio and i'm enjoying it and i know the audience is i mean matt drudge
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:49.080]  is kind of co-host on the alec show show right now this is crazy maybe i'll join facebook
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:56.280]  oh yeah i don't do that no well i can't i i realize that i just might my personalities i've got to
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:02.200]  stay focused i can't i can't be too distracted you know your advice to me was right you know
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:06.040]  like a year ago that don't try to do too much i mean you're right i have paul joseph watson i
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:12.840]  told him watch out for this this you know it's it's it's a it's a larger topic but at my height of
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:20.040]  media availability i was doing the website the tv show and the radio show at the same time as you
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:27.560]  are doing now as you are doing now uh mine was with the corporations clear channel news corp
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:34.040]  and then the drudge report but still i felt just myself it i i felt it was just more powerful to go
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:40.680]  to the web plus not to necessarily be playing in their playground because the power of the
[02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:46.680]  individual as you represent sitting there right now is powerful to the heart i said to paul
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:51.320]  joseph watson when i saw him in london which you just referred to a year ago you're a romantic
[02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:57.240]  figure alex in americana it's wrong it's romantic what you do here every day it just is this is
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:04.680]  romance because you're an american standing up tough facing these headwinds wow are they blowing
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:11.080]  but you're there and they're there's and you're not alone limbaugh savage panady levin there's a
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:15.800]  lot of people on the airwaves who are as brave they are brave and they are living it i've met
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:24.520]  them all i'm friends with them all they are also operating against the grain in an america that
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:29.480]  needs to go back to that well the systems tried to put some of them in jail i mean i know a lot of
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:33.320]  those folks don't talk about the stuff that goes on behind the scenes i don't either but you know
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:37.480]  these people play hardball and and some folks can say who are libertarians well those folks don't
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:42.520]  sound libertarian enough to me it doesn't matter the globalists the democrats the the collectivist
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:47.720]  hate anybody who's conservative anybody who believes in the individual and the fact is those people
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:53.240]  promote individualism nationalism and that's why they've got to be eradicated uh what a horrible
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:59.160]  world if the system is successful matt drudge in your gut in your heart do you think that humanity
[02:40:59.160 --> 02:41:03.960]  is going to be successful and make it the next hundred years oh the hundred years well of course
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:08.920]  unless mother nature decides you know i'm a big fan of letting mother nature decide some of this
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:14.760]  too you know we can't control a lot of this there is a law to the universe there just is
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:19.560]  there's just a law to the universe we could have the san andrea's ripped tonight you have nothing
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:24.920]  to do with that we could have had that super hurricane that look what they did to south carolina
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:29.640]  two or three hundred miles offshore imagine if a category five eyewall went right up the
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:35.320]  chesapeake bay they could say well mankind did that no mother nature decides so will we survive
[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:42.520]  i'm sure we will what will we be uh not allowed to speak as we are today well we'll have it documented
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:49.240]  that we were allowed to speak that way once so i i don't know am i optimistic for myself personally
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:54.520]  yes i'm strong there's not much they can do they could laser beam me they could drone me they can
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:59.640]  plutonium me they could do whatever they want but spiritually i'm set i've already got it
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:06.840]  so they can't do much i just wish there was more media that was trailblazing and independent
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:13.240]  and this to me is a as a big danger right now in this setup is you've got these corporations like
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:19.720]  the new york times and the amazon now with the washington post and time warner and all of them
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:26.280]  seem to be the same this is what's frightening and there's so much news in the course of the day
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:32.360]  and the reason i think the drudge report has is interesting every morning is it's not exactly
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:37.880]  the same as you would see elsewhere and that's because i'm not involved with other people
[02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:43.560]  i'm looking at the world through my eyes and that's what you're seeing with bravery and with
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:50.360]  the ability to do it because uh the ability to do it what you've created here with one listener
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:56.440]  one day that went to 10 listeners that went to 50 to now your millions was organically grown
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:00.520]  and that's kind of how earth uh proceeds and it usually takes time you're absolutely right
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:06.200]  looking at the open announcements by the pope for world government carbon taxes looking for
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:12.440]  obama announcing similar things they've gone from denying this planetary systems being set up to now
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:18.120]  admitting it we've got all these key meetings tpp being agreed on uh just a few days ago
[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:24.040]  how is that affecting the people that were brainwashed and told none of this was happening
[02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:29.800]  how are they going to respond now when all of this starts coming to fruition i've been traveling a
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:35.320]  lot and i'm seeing a lot of desperation everywhere a lot of sad desperation i was just in an airport
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:41.000]  and even down to this a woman selling southwest airlines credit cards standing like a robot
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:46.360]  have you signed up yet are you a member of the club it was tragic this is a mature woman
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:51.400]  with a beautiful face in life and i'm like how did she get there what has happened to this culture
[02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:58.200]  that she's now standing as a robot like this they are sucking our ability to make uh an
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:02.760]  income that is compatible with what you need to so i'm getting a little frightened as i travel
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:08.520]  on the other side of it when i go to new york and i see some of the billionaires it's the other side
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:15.000]  endless you know they're fighting over pieces of artwork it's it's gotten to the point where
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.680]  they have and they have nots here is breaking so and it's the billionaires that are mainly
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:24.360]  funding the whole leftist redistribution movement because they end up getting the money in corporate
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:30.120]  welfare and insider deals it's so sick i watched a great film i don't know if you've seen it yet
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:34.360]  but it's uh the best of enemies about goreville doll and william f buckley have you seen that yet
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:40.040]  no you've got to see it and it shows goreville arguing saying the interest oh and by the way
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:44.600]  why are we not allowed to have a goreville doll william buckley anymore in the media scene do you
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:51.480]  see who they hire do you see who's hired for the shows how dull they are yes dull dull as dish
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:55.400]  what they want you to tune out of politics in an entertainment yes they make it where are the
[02:44:55.400 --> 02:45:01.880]  flamboyant characters this is what america desperately needs right now flamboyant intellectual
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:07.400]  characters who can cut different ways uh and that's just what i'm missing i'm i'm been fortunate
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:12.440]  enough to meet some of the greats of this generation and i've got to tell you they are there it's just
[02:45:12.440 --> 02:45:17.640]  they are suppressed and hidden and they're not hired the way goreville doll and buckley were
[02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:23.320]  back of previous generation they were not afraid of ideas this generation is frightened of ideas
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:27.640]  or at least it's being suppressed let's throw in in the few minutes we have lefts we're about to
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:30.760]  go to break and i know you've given us more time than you even said you would matt drudge is our
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:36.280]  gas drudge report dot com obviously in studio here in austin texas visiting a surprise visit one of
[02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:41.640]  the best ever that's better than surprise birthday parties i've had shifting gears i don't think that
[02:45:41.640 --> 02:45:47.560]  it's putin's this great angel of this wonderful perfect person but our foreign policy is so corrupt
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:52.520]  so deceptive it makes him look good and nobody's going to back al qaeda i talked about this last
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:56.200]  thursday and friday and i'll find the article and we'll put it in this video later and put it out
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:46:04.040]  as a report but it was it was roiders reporting that the winehouse is angry that um these airstrikes
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:11.400]  by the russians have hit the moderates al nazra which is al qaeda in syria and then it just went
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:16.840]  on and they're telling him to stop doing it and he didn't hit isis but then putin pointed out no
[02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:21.320]  that's the bosses of isis that's just their fighters it's the same group which is true but it's
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:27.320]  twilight zone i can't even believe i'm reading roiders who has riders with a straight face
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:32.200]  that will just sit there and write articles about how al qaeda is moderate and not bad
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:36.920]  and then we criticize russia for bombing them when they're attacking russian interest
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:44.120]  it's just so bizarre it seems like that carl rove quote recently control reality i don't think obama
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:48.840]  and these guys really control reality and now we've got john mccain saying let's go ahead and ends
[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:53.720]  the big presence team and have war with russia let's go ahead and attack the russian aircraft
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:58.920]  i mean it's crazy town what do you say to that well i'll say this we never even heard of isis
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:03.000]  until recently and i remember when that name first started coming up do you know it was
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:08.120]  designed to be confused with darrell isa no i didn't know that you know that's what it was
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:12.200]  because darrell isa was the enemy at the time of this administration you know there would have been
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:16.760]  a time obama could have been impeached i'm thinking the irs scandal most likely that would have been
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:22.520]  the one you get the depositions going you get the president under oath you follow the chain
[02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:27.880]  obama most likely would have been op impeached banner decided we're not going there we're not
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:33.560]  going to have those cities burn we're not going to do it we're not going to impeach obama uh so
[02:47:33.560 --> 02:47:41.400]  i felt darrell isa that's his name right because i'm getting all isle isa issa darrell isa i think
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:47.560]  they were they came up with the name isis to be confused with darrell isa i'm really being honest
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:54.200]  with you i remember when the first time christiana mempore sputtered out this word isis i mean where
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:48:00.120]  did she get that one you know these words are creative these events are created now we act like
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:07.000]  oh isis has been around for 20 30 years says who's around a year and a half yeah designed to confuse
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:15.720]  and then the president going it's not even isis it's isle or is or is or is this is dr seuss
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:20.600]  this is madness so well i'm not able to follow any of it because when i sit down and look at the news
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:26.600]  i'm not able to follow the bouncing ball is putin here is obama here where does this one go where i
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:32.120]  can't follow can you put the pieces together i'm glad you can because i can't wow well we're going
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:35.320]  to break here in about a minute and a half and then i'm going to come back and play a special
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:39.160]  report they're going to go into the fourth hour being hosted by one of our co-host today but
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:42.600]  matt in the two minutes we've out left it's amazing to have you here what else do you
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:46.920]  think's front and center in the universe and the last two minutes here what do you want to say
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:52.280]  to the audience and to the dinosaur media uh that is going to gleefully try to edit this and
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:57.480]  chop this up and i guess use it for their funeral pyre well they're welcome to again they've got
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:04.680]  no control over the situation none no control no control over me sorry zero i wanted to
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:08.360]  congratulate you you one of the and people don't really talk about this you are one of the first
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:15.480]  to stream 24 hours a day and i think the reason i was drawn into info wars was because of this
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:23.320]  streaming uh this is a profound break that you did to allow the audience to hear you at any time
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:29.240]  to make it available at any time from anywhere looping looping looping until the next broadcast
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:33.640]  this is a profound thing you did i don't think that's recognized enough in the industry i'm just
[02:49:33.640 --> 02:49:39.880]  talking shop top shop talk here for a second that was big because what you're seeing with the am
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:43.960]  dial now and i'm not besmirching any stations that are carrying this right now but some of
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:47.880]  these ratings are frightening some of these ratings in these major cities are frightening i'm
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:54.760]  talking about half the listeners generally overall for every uh talk host some of them are down
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:50:02.920]  a half a half in one year something is going on but you broke through with this 24 hour looping
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:08.360]  always available on my happiest nights i'm sitting here and i'm listening to you from
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:14.280]  wherever i am in the world looping getting it getting it getting it and the guests this is
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:20.280]  a profound shift available anytime from anywhere well that was you alex that was like 12 years ago
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:26.760]  i said why do we just send the stream out once uh and then wait for a podcast to come up for
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:32.760]  they even called it podcast which is an mp3 organically again yet again another organically
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:36.680]  grown decision that changed the media landscape well sure and i said why not just have i don't
[02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:40.200]  want to just have because i was one of the first people were doing this 20 years ago limbo was
[02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:45.240]  probably the first with a little you know pod cam took a photo every minute or something i said why
[02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:50.120]  don't we just put cameras in here so i could show people articles show them photos show them books
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:54.840]  and even show them video clips and then we'll start streaming it and by the way limbo was
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:51:00.600]  genius for doing that because he bypassed broadcast he didn't have to hook up with a fox or a cnn to
[02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:05.480]  show him in real time he was able to bypass that and i think there was some cams for radio shows
[02:51:05.480 --> 02:51:10.280]  before that sure but he did it on the larger scale but what you did by breaking the mold by
[02:51:10.280 --> 02:51:15.080]  breaking the mold whatever you said that day like why don't we loop it i can't tell you how that's
[02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:21.000]  changed i would i would say the majority of your listeners are have and will discover you through
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:25.400]  the looping and the broadcast because now we can drive around and listen to you without the streaming
[02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:30.280]  even though it seems like the streaming is what what the where things are going i got to say
[02:51:30.280 --> 02:51:35.960]  when you broke the egg there when you crack the egg that was a big one that was a stanley kubrick
[02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:40.280]  moment of the bone going up what you did with that one so that was well i don't think it's as big
[02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:44.200]  as the bones you've been throwing up the turn into the spaceships but i tell you it's amazing
[02:51:44.200 --> 02:51:48.360]  to just have the diverse audience the tunes in to hear me babble speak of the devil like people
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:51.720]  like stanley kubrick's daughter and folks that have popped up too and you're like you check it out
[02:51:51.720 --> 02:51:55.400]  and this is really stanley kubrick's daughter that helped make some of his films it just blows
[02:51:55.400 --> 02:51:59.640]  by the way if stanley kubrick was alive can you imagine can you imagine where he would have gone
[02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:04.280]  he would have done some great work oh we're missing the hollywood push too where's the
[02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:07.720]  greatness coming out of hollywood they want it dumbed down i've talked about enough enough of
[02:52:07.720 --> 02:52:11.960]  the martian crap tell us something telling us something big and real and profound as kubrick
[02:52:11.960 --> 02:52:16.520]  would have on a human level on a human level well i'm not allowed to say what i was told about
[02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:21.160]  kubrick but let me say it was obvious from his films he would he was beyond bored with us he
[02:52:21.160 --> 02:52:27.160]  was you know spielberg keeps going back to world war two i mean enough already let's let's get
[02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:32.600]  focused i look at a p t anderson and i don't know it's kind of gone into a marijuana cloud for me
[02:52:32.600 --> 02:52:36.920]  where are the artists who are challenging this generation like kubrick did so that's another
[02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:40.600]  topic separately but well we're going to break in one minute we're gonna air john bound's report
[02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:46.680]  come back and who's hosting the fourth hour today i'm so thunders truck that i oh david night's got
[02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:50.920]  a bunch coming up and obviously we need to get clips of this epic interview play those and put
[02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:56.600]  those out on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and matt how how fast do you think here's
[02:52:56.600 --> 02:53:00.600]  what's crazy five years ago i carried a mainstream media wrote stories against us or i cared if i
[02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:04.760]  was on nightline or something you've been in more big stuff than i am now it doesn't even do anything
[02:53:04.760 --> 02:53:10.200]  when i'm on those shows that's why i know that they don't mean anything and so we should end with this
[02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:16.760]  you were the guy who tweeted uh at least from what i saw at pierce morgan three years ago
[02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:21.800]  or two and a half years ago to say have alex jones on debate him matchmaker yeah behind the scenes
[02:53:21.800 --> 02:53:26.920]  people don't know this about me i'm a matchmaker behind the scenes that i've had the ability to
[02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:31.080]  make some deals happen and do some things behind the scenes now i've never met pierce morgan but
[02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:34.840]  i do believe that tweet that day did lead to that you're right well no they told me this office they
[02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:38.120]  said what do you think i'm at drudge's idea because they got my cell phone number and called me
[02:53:38.120 --> 02:53:42.680]  seeing it had it i said which ended up being the most dramatic moment on cnn in a generation
[02:53:43.240 --> 02:53:47.880]  they admit that they have votes and say that that's why they need to hire people away from sixth
[02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:52.360]  avenue just to look at the scene i remember once saying to charlie rose where why aren't you have
[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:57.720]  more conservatives on it he says who and i you know there's a whole list of them why are they
[02:53:57.720 --> 02:54:03.800]  limiting themselves because you would say it's a you know it's contrived plan to limit but i still
[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:08.760]  think to make provocative programming you've got to have different points of view a la the buckley
[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:16.280]  and uh vedal gore vedal where is that in this culture it's missing i get it from info wars i
[02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:20.440]  get it from other places too mainly talk radio talk radio seems to be the driving force of this
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:26.280]  culture at least in uh spoken word i'm not getting it from a television that much i'm just not
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:31.560]  where are the intriguing television shows i mean you could say homeland you can say some of these
[02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:37.880]  others okay yes but where are the real dynamic things that are pushing where let's expand on that
[02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:43.560]  appears morgan had a ratings boost for about 30 40 for two weeks after that then it went down
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:50.040]  steadily declined and they got rid of him cnn knows that if they put my commentary on or your
[02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:54.680]  commentary others tens of millions would tune in to watch it they know that they have to control the
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:59.720]  narrative because it's an agenda even if it's self-defeating and destroying them so where do
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:05.320]  you think that ends up going them attempting to censor us well it all depends if the sick americans
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:11.320]  get get unsick that's all that's all you just have to do because if you get well if you get well
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:16.520]  you're not that interested in what anderson cooper is saying about things you're just not i'm sorry
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:22.840]  i don't need to be insulting if you're sick you find comfort in that i have what are your final
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:28.760]  words final words these are the last words ever spoken on earth is these these are the final word

[02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:25.960]  you matt that was an amazing 45 minutes here's the report there's been another mass shooting in america
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:33.000]  this time in a community college in oregon that means there are more american families
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:43.240]  moms dads children whose lives have been changed forever that means there's another community
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:49.400]  stunned with grief and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:57.240]  and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been
[02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:06.040]  their families or their children we talked about this after columbine and blacksburg after tucson
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:13.080]  after newtown after aurora after charleston it cannot be this easy for somebody who wants
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:20.600]  to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun more families victimized
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:25.880]  more average citizens president obama may or may not personally offer his condolences to because
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:31.400]  he is too busy pleading his case to eliminate our constitutional second amendment right to protect
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:37.880]  ourselves and our communities pew research is july 2014 poll the demographics and politics of gun
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:44.120]  owning households found that about six in ten gun household members 64 say they often feel proud
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:51.720]  to be an american in contrast about half 51 of other adults say this there exists a constitutional
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:56.680]  mindset and reason for owning a weapon in the united states the united states ranks
[02:57:56.680 --> 02:58:04.360]  numero uno in gun ownership dominating at 88.8 percent per 100 residents according to 2014
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:09.720]  numbers from the small arms survey based in geneva switzerland a group staffed by experts in
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:15.400]  security studies political science law international public policy developmental studies economics
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:20.520]  conflict resolution and sociology these are the people pushing the international policies to
[02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:27.160]  agendize constitutional freedoms we as a nation require in order for our republic to operate
[02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:32.360]  and the media spin on the coverage is always the same who cares who the shooter was in oregon
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:37.880]  why should we our immediate and only reality-based concerns should be for the families and communities
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:43.160]  that need to be protected by the next incident whether it's three months or three years from now

[03:00:24.200 --> 03:00:29.800]  fox day in the uk there's going to be a million mask march today around the world we'll see what
[03:00:29.800 --> 03:00:35.320]  happens with that there's a live blog of that on rt i'll be talking about that uh to jacari jackson
[03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:39.640]  later in the show he'll be joining me at the bottom of the hour some of the things we were
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:43.720]  talking about with him once he gets on here we're going to be talking about disney using a film
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:48.680]  to tell us that of course this is a documentary this is the way this is coming out this is a
[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:57.880]  abigale disney and they're putting this documentary out and telling gun owners that owning a gun is
[03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:02.600]  incompatible with being a christian you can't be pro-life and own a gun so we'll be talking about
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:09.640]  that as well as what happened after the election did bloomberg's campaign to shut down guns uh he
[03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:13.960]  spent a lot of money what kind of results did he get we're going to have that for you as well
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:17.640]  there's also a story that we'll be covering in the miscellaneous information about a virginia toll
[03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:25.560]  road a major legal setback they have been finding people up to one thousand dollars for each unpaid
[03:01:25.560 --> 03:01:31.960]  toll that's just a fine portion and of course this is something that was snuck in by a corporation
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:38.120]  oh speaking of corporations sneaking in stuff today we had the release of the trans-pacific
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:42.360]  partnership it surfaced first in new zealand i guess all the governments involved decided
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:46.760]  that they were going to release it on the 5th of november why not put it out on guy fox days one way
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:52.280]  to get back at the population right uh they released it today and of course new zealand being
[03:01:52.280 --> 03:01:56.600]  where the day begins they got their text up first we're going to talk about what has been revealed
[03:01:56.600 --> 03:02:03.720]  about it basically all we see is the media still spinning this still controlling this uh there's
[03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:07.960]  that graphic there isn't that interesting if you're looking at this that's the white house
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:11.720]  talking about the trans-pacific partnership and they've got this little logo that they've created
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:18.280]  that looks very much like obama's logo tpp and underneath it made in america and of course we
[03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:26.120]  need to strike out that made in america and put above it made in secret this wasn't created by the
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:31.080]  american government in spite of what obama and the white house wanted to tell us he says that we
[03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:37.080]  with tpp we're writing the rules of the road for the 21st century that's absolute baloney america
[03:02:37.080 --> 03:02:41.640]  didn't write those rules america couldn't even see those rules our elected representatives
[03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:47.400]  could not even see it they were not a part of the process it was being done by corporate lobbyists
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:52.760]  there you go made in secret that's really what is behind this whole thing i think it's a very
[03:02:52.760 --> 03:03:01.720]  interesting part of this massive slick propaganda stuff that we're seeing from obama we've seen
[03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:05.720]  that from him ever since he went in we're going to talk about what's going on with us of course
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:09.960]  there's three mechanisms that they're moving us to world government very rapidly one of those
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:14.520]  is the trade treaties another one is climate change and that's going to be a treaty that's
[03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:19.400]  going to be coming up in december probably about the same time this will come to a vote a lot of
[03:03:19.400 --> 03:03:22.920]  people are saying they didn't expect this to happen until after the beginning of the year i'm
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:28.280]  going to tell you why i think it's going to happen around the holidays i've always thought that's
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:33.960]  going to be the case and certainly according to the trade promotion authority they could do that
[03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:38.680]  within 30 days i'm going to read you the documents from that but when we look at the mechanisms
[03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:43.480]  that they're using right now to create global governance there's the trade treaties that unify
[03:03:43.480 --> 03:03:48.040]  us politically and economically just like the european union as senator sessions one of the few
[03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:53.480]  people who bothered to read this agreement pointed out and warned us about and of course that's also
[03:03:53.480 --> 03:03:59.000]  going to create a a new government organization that is transnational but they have to take
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:03.640]  down the existing national governments and the way that they're going to do that is with open
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:08.760]  borders with multiculturalism with what we see going on in europe what is happening in america
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:15.160]  as well so the third leg of that is going to be climate change agreement so we've got the treaty
[03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:20.200]  we've got climate change both of those will give us global structures will give us a taxing mechanism
[03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:25.160]  in the case of climate change they will give us a bureaucracy a regulatory mechanism we have to
[03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:30.920]  have that for global governance it'll also give us some kind of a planetary council that will
[03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:35.320]  enforce this agreement but of course we're also going to have a political and economic union we're
[03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:43.400]  also going to have a a governance body that can write these rules independent of whatever it says
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:48.440]  do we have 2 000 pages 6 000 pages it really doesn't matter because they can change it as well
[03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:53.320]  we'll be right back i'm going to talk to you about details that we've seen of the tpp stay with us
[03:04:58.600 --> 03:05:04.360]  you're racist if you attack plan parenthood that's according to feminist icon glorious steinem
[03:05:04.360 --> 03:05:10.120]  steinem claims the current backlash against plan parenthood is part of an ultra right-wing attempt
[03:05:10.120 --> 03:05:16.520]  to restore the basis of patriarchy a long-term racist system which is controlling reproduction
[03:05:16.520 --> 03:05:22.120]  and to control reproduction you have to control the bodies of women what kind of inverted reality
[03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:27.880]  is this cia connected activists living in contrary to all those social justice buzzwords
[03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:34.440]  plan parenthood was founded by a self-described racist founder margaret sanger famously said
[03:05:34.440 --> 03:05:41.080]  in 1939 we don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population
[03:05:41.080 --> 03:05:46.840]  plan parenthood was founded to control the bodies of black women in order to control the black
[03:05:46.840 --> 03:05:52.280]  population if you can wade through all of steinem's doublespeak you might just figure out who the real

[03:08:05.960 --> 03:08:15.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show this fifth of november 2015 i am david night your host
[03:08:15.960 --> 03:08:20.360]  jacarjax will be joining me at the bottom of the hour we're going to talk about pierce morgan
[03:08:20.360 --> 03:08:25.240]  he's back in the news telling us how to conduct our foreign policy this time he says isis is going
[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:30.840]  to nuke america so we got to invade the middle east well you know i would suggest this to pierce
[03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:36.520]  he had figured out how to stop gun violence in america you just simply you just pass a law
[03:08:36.520 --> 03:08:42.200]  and gun violence stops instantly so i would suggest that we pass a law instead of invading
[03:08:42.200 --> 03:08:47.240]  the middle east just pass a law saying that we're going to it's illegal to conduct nuclear
[03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:52.360]  terror in the united states or to put bombs on planes and then we can disband the tsa and we can
[03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:58.440]  do all those things because everybody will listen to the law right same way they do with guns
[03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:04.360]  also we're going to play the clip from bill mower saying that info wars is a website that real
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:12.760]  americans read he did it as a dig to us and of course it was a cleverly done way to associate
[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:19.720]  nonsense with info wars but i think we ought to take that and use that as our subtitle
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:26.920]  the website that real americans read info wars i'll take that we're going to be talking about a
[03:09:26.920 --> 03:09:34.040]  toll scandal that's going on in virginia up to a thousand dollar fines if you don't pay a toll
[03:09:34.040 --> 03:09:39.160]  and that's of course a private corporation because most of these toll roads are owned
[03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:43.240]  by private corporations the one in virginia is owned by an australian corporation i believe
[03:09:43.880 --> 03:09:49.720]  and the ones in texas most of the ones here in texas are owned by a spanish corporation that pushes
[03:09:49.720 --> 03:09:54.360]  these things through very much like what we're seeing with a trans-pacific partnership i'm
[03:09:54.360 --> 03:09:58.280]  going to give you the details that we've seen so far with this it's going to be it's going to take
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:04.120]  us some time to analyze this because it is literally several thousand pages long but we're
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:08.680]  going to look at the timing we're going to look at the reaction of the media of some politicians
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:12.200]  to it and i'm going to give you my thoughts on when i think this is going to come through
[03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:19.160]  we also have some more news about jeb uh his dad had written prepared a book to be released about
[03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:24.440]  now i guess he figured that jeb would be taking a lot of flak in his campaign right now because of
[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:30.040]  things that his brother did with iraq for example and so he's got this book that he just released
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:35.960]  that throws cheney and rumsfeld under the bus i agree with that throw them under the bus back it up
[03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:43.160]  run over him again fine but that doesn't relieve your son of the responsibility he was president
[03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:46.600]  okay we're going to talk about that and we're going to talk about something else the american
[03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:51.880]  government doesn't want to take responsibility for and that is the shooting in afghanistan the
[03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:59.000]  kunduz hospital doctors without borders released their report today said staff were shot while
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:04.600]  they were fleeing the burning building this is an attack that went on for 30 minutes and of course
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:10.200]  you can always have a hospital hit by accident with bombs or munition or whatever but when you
[03:11:10.200 --> 03:11:17.880]  have a sustained attack even after you have called the afghan government called the pentagon
[03:11:17.880 --> 03:11:22.760]  told them that you're under attack and they sustain it for 30 minutes this is a war crime
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:27.800]  folks we're going to talk about that as well as what the u.s. government did to push back on that
[03:11:27.800 --> 03:11:32.440]  and before i go to those articles let me tell you that today we've got a new sale on brain force
[03:11:32.440 --> 03:11:39.400]  an unprecedented 25 off of brain force one of our most popular formulations something that i use

[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:42.040]  25 percent off a sale begins today at info wars life dot com let's take a look at the tpp
[03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:46.920]  new zealand released this first i think all the governments involved decided they would release
[03:12:46.920 --> 03:12:54.040]  it today and of course the day begins in new zealand they pointed out and now some american
[03:12:54.600 --> 03:13:00.920]  sources have said that it's 2000 pages but they're saying it's 6000 pages see we don't know what's in
[03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:06.200]  it yet there is so much information there that even though they took a month to release it
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:10.440]  we still don't know exactly what is in it yet i thought it was very interesting
[03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:16.920]  that the ap came out with just a glowing review of this saying details of the controversial
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:23.480]  pacific trade deal are released they say it is mind boggling in detail but they already know what's
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:30.120]  in it even though it's so large they say it is chock full of good intentions i'm serious this
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:35.400]  is what passes for objective journalism in the united states this is the associated press
[03:13:35.960 --> 03:13:43.800]  the revered mainstream backbone here things like Reuters ap new york times okay these are the people
[03:13:43.800 --> 03:13:48.520]  were supposed to respect this is what they say of a of an agreement that they couldn't possibly have
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:52.920]  read and analyze right now we'll tell you why but they tell you they sum it up well that's great
[03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:57.000]  you know people were concerned because it was being done in secret critics complained about it being
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:14:02.600]  forged in secret but it is chock full of good intentions these negotiators have agreed to
[03:14:02.600 --> 03:14:07.560]  promote environmental sustainability respect rights and needs of indigenous people temper
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:12.760]  protections for drug patients with safeguards for public health and access to medicines i mean you
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:19.720]  know what's not to like about that what a piece of propaganda and then they go on and say you know
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:25.560]  instead of saying no amendments will be allowed which i consider to be a bug they say that's a
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:30.440]  feature and this is the way they report it lawmakers can't nitpick the deal with amendments
[03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:35.240]  yeah yeah they're not going to have any say folks yeah isn't that a great thing
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:41.880]  isn't that a great thing that our congress agreed to subvert the constitution for a treaty because
[03:14:41.880 --> 03:14:46.280]  that's what this is it's a treaty they said we're going to ignore the constitutional process for a
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:51.400]  treaty why not they've ignored the constitution for their illegal war on drugs for 44 years they
[03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:56.120]  needed an amendment to prohibit alcohol but they prohibit everything now unless it's expressly permitted
[03:14:56.120 --> 03:15:00.360]  so yeah why should they worry about the process for running a trade treaty through
[03:15:00.360 --> 03:15:05.480]  just ignore it and the good news is they can't nitpick it with those little pesky amendments
[03:15:05.480 --> 03:15:09.400]  they can't hold it up it's going to immediately it's going it's got a time frame where if they
[03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:15.400]  don't bring it to the table to vote on it it will automatically go there well in terms of
[03:15:15.400 --> 03:15:20.440]  New Zealand let's look at what some people there are saying this report from New Zealand says the
[03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:26.600]  deal is a boon to New Zealand exporters wiping tariffs on a range of goods exported to the United
[03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:32.760]  States Japan Canada Mexico Peru see every government is telling and the press of every government I
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:39.400]  should say is telling their people this is great you guys won you guys won we we just hammered
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:43.800]  the other guys I mean they're all talking like Donald Trump just you know after he negotiates
[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:49.160]  a deal we won we kick these guys we got everything we wanted the American workers going to be doing
[03:15:49.160 --> 03:15:54.200]  great meanwhile the New Zealand people are telling them the same thing and it's like every government
[03:15:54.200 --> 03:15:58.520]  wants you to think that they won they say the government estimates this is going to be worth
[03:15:58.520 --> 03:16:04.840]  2.7 billion dollars a year by 2030 for the New Zealand at a minimum at a minimum well some
[03:16:04.840 --> 03:16:10.680]  skeptics come back and they say well I don't know they've been coy about who has done this analysis
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:16.040]  especially on the projections of 2.7 billion dollar benefits for the economy and he points
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:20.920]  this out he says it's not clear whether this will start a 90-day countdown before Obama is allowed
[03:16:20.920 --> 03:16:29.000]  to sign the agreement an analyst from New Zealand said actually not from New Zealand TPP opponent I'm
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:34.120]  not sure where this professor is from Jane Kelsey said the legal text was not enough on its own we
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:38.840]  need to see the background documents that help make sense of the text but the parties have vowed
[03:16:38.840 --> 03:16:45.000]  to keep them secret for another six years in other words the life of the agreement so we're not
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:50.920]  allowed to see the background legal documents to help understand this that's going to remain secret
[03:16:50.920 --> 03:16:55.400]  isn't that interesting the public can't see it our elected representatives can't see it
[03:16:55.400 --> 03:17:01.560]  but the stakeholders can see it because you are not a stakeholder you don't have a stake in the
[03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:07.320]  future if they run this through the way they want to run it through now again RT has comments on it
[03:17:07.320 --> 03:17:11.880]  they say the negotiations lasted for five years yes Obama has said the main target of the accord
[03:17:11.880 --> 03:17:18.680]  was to oust the Chinese dominance in the region so they hold the Chinese up as the straw man say
[03:17:18.680 --> 03:17:23.560]  we've got to do this because they're killing us on trade folks this is the way we're going to get
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:28.440]  this back all right senator sessions looked at all this and senator sessions pointed out this
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:34.280]  is a living agreement we can look at it and we can analyze the 2000 pages we can analyze it the
[03:17:34.280 --> 03:17:38.280]  6000 pages if you put all that together that's what the New Zealand government is telling us the
[03:17:38.280 --> 03:17:43.880]  American government is telling us it's 2000 pages we can look at all that we can analyze that maybe
[03:17:43.880 --> 03:17:49.160]  not completely because we can't see a lot of stuff that's going to be health secret for the life of
[03:17:49.160 --> 03:17:52.840]  the agreement the agreement goes for six years they're not going to show us the background legal
[03:17:53.560 --> 03:17:59.560]  things that we need to interpret this but here's the issue as senator sessions pointed out this is
[03:17:59.560 --> 03:18:05.400]  a living agreement and here's the quote he says the TPP will be a living agreement that means the
[03:18:05.400 --> 03:18:10.840]  entity itself the commission will then be entitled to make it say different things to eliminate
[03:18:10.840 --> 03:18:16.200]  provisions it doesn't like to add provisions it doesn't like in fact the commission is required
[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:21.640]  to meet regularly to hear advice for changes from outside groups from inside committees on the
[03:18:21.640 --> 03:18:27.880]  commission so that they can update the situation for changed circumstances in other words not only
[03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:34.120]  can they change it they're going to have regularly scheduled meetings to change it and those changes
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:38.760]  will take place without any further involvement of course there hasn't been any involvement yet
[03:18:38.760 --> 03:18:42.600]  from our elected representatives or any of the elected representatives from any of the countries
[03:18:42.600 --> 03:18:47.320]  involved there's simply been corporate lobbyists who've been putting this together but they won't
[03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:52.040]  ask us for any changes and there won't be any up or down votes on those changes those changes
[03:18:52.040 --> 03:18:56.840]  will take effect and as he pointed out not only can they change all of the details anything and
[03:18:56.840 --> 03:19:03.240]  everything to send these two to six thousand pages they can also add whoever they wish so they could
[03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:08.840]  add china tomorrow after they scare everybody about how this has to be done to counter china
[03:19:08.840 --> 03:19:15.080]  they can then add china to the agreement and he also had this to say this is going back a few
[03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:20.520]  months ago this is in the summer when senator sessions went there and read it and put together
[03:19:20.520 --> 03:19:26.120]  a power or not a powerpoint it was a cards that he had printed up showing it to the people in
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:30.680]  the senate as if they cared he was the only one who cared about this he was the only one who cared
[03:19:30.680 --> 03:19:35.160]  look at this he tried to tell them the entire purpose is for congress to surrender its power
[03:19:35.160 --> 03:19:38.680]  to the executive branch that's what they were doing with the promotion authority he says
[03:19:38.680 --> 03:19:43.800]  why do we have to create a transnational union that has the impact on the laws of the united
[03:19:43.800 --> 03:19:48.440]  states that creates something that is a century like the european union stay with us we'll be right

[03:24:05.800 --> 03:24:11.160]  welcome back to the alexiom show i'm david night your host on the thursday november 5th 2015
[03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:15.880]  we're talking about the release of the trans specific partnership the text has finally come
[03:24:15.880 --> 03:24:21.080]  out of course no one has had time to read it but we are seeing glowing reviews and the mainstream
[03:24:21.080 --> 03:24:26.920]  press saying that it's basically one of the best things that's ever happened it has really good
[03:24:26.920 --> 03:24:31.720]  intentions but they couldn't possibly have read this thing in this amount of time and done any
[03:24:31.720 --> 03:24:36.920]  analysis of it but here's what's going on with this understand there are three mechanisms that
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:43.080]  are happening right now to create global governance the first one is to erase existing sovereignty
[03:24:43.080 --> 03:24:48.280]  lines that's what's going on with the open borders that's what's going on with the massive flow of
[03:24:48.280 --> 03:24:55.400]  people from the third world into europe and into america that is to destroy the culture to destroy
[03:24:55.400 --> 03:25:00.360]  the national sovereignty to erase those borders then they need to erect something in its place
[03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:04.840]  and we have two mechanisms that are happening right now to do that one of them of course is
[03:25:04.840 --> 03:25:11.000]  going to be these partnerships these global trade agreements those are not only trade agreements
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:16.440]  those are political and economic unions that was what senator sessions told us when he looked at
[03:25:16.440 --> 03:25:21.560]  that he said this is first of all handing over this authority to a transnational committee that
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:27.080]  can change the rules of this at will that means that they can tax they can regulate our economy
[03:25:27.080 --> 03:25:33.000]  this unelected unaccountable international body can do that after this is passed so that's one
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:37.240]  aspect of it another way that they will come at us with a global governance so we'll have the ability
[03:25:37.240 --> 03:25:42.200]  to tax and to regulate us is through the climate change agreement that they're going to be working
[03:25:42.200 --> 03:25:46.920]  on in the beginning of well the beginning of december actually starts november 30th to i think
[03:25:46.920 --> 03:25:50.600]  december the 13th if i remember the dates correctly first couple of weeks of december
[03:25:51.560 --> 03:25:55.240]  when will this tpp go through well a lot of people are saying they don't think that it is
[03:25:55.240 --> 03:26:01.000]  going to come up for a vote until sometime after the first of the year because when you look at
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:09.160]  the fast track authority where congress advocated its constitutional duty on passing treaties and
[03:26:09.160 --> 03:26:15.880]  changed it from a two-thirds majority in the senate to a simple majority in both the house and
[03:26:15.880 --> 03:26:22.040]  the senate once this thing is shown to people and erasing their ability to do any amendments to it
[03:26:22.040 --> 03:26:28.440]  to adjust the timing understand that once this is presented to the public they have 30 days it
[03:26:28.440 --> 03:26:34.680]  needs to be presented to the public they also have 45 days on which to act on it but that doesn't
[03:26:34.680 --> 03:26:39.400]  mean that they have to take all 45 of those days if you look at the trade promotion authority
[03:26:39.400 --> 03:26:44.120]  what it says is that if they don't do anything in 45 days then it will come out of committee
[03:26:44.120 --> 03:26:49.480]  it will be presented to them on the floor for a vote so that's the maximum amount of time the only
[03:26:50.040 --> 03:26:54.920]  the only condition that i see here when i look at this and i could be wrong i'm not a lawyer
[03:26:54.920 --> 03:27:00.280]  and we need to have lawyers eyes on this but when i look at this what it says is that the public
[03:27:00.280 --> 03:27:05.000]  has this for 30 days and then at that point this is why they say the release of the negotiating
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:08.840]  text to the public prior to the agreements being signed by the administration the final text of
[03:27:08.840 --> 03:27:13.880]  the implementing legislation and a draft agreement must be submitted to congress 30 days prior to its
[03:27:13.880 --> 03:27:18.360]  introduction so that means that after the public has had 30 days to look at it they can introduce
[03:27:18.360 --> 03:27:23.880]  it that means that they could do this during the holidays which is when they like to do this stuff
[03:27:23.880 --> 03:27:29.240]  that's when they passed the federal reserve act they did that on christmas eve we had uh on new
[03:27:29.240 --> 03:27:36.200]  years eve obama signed the ndaa saying the uh military could retain people indefinitely without
[03:27:36.200 --> 03:27:41.080]  trial without due process they'd like to sneak these things through during the holidays when no
[03:27:41.080 --> 03:27:46.360]  one is paying attention and so i think that they're still going to that they're on schedule to release
[03:27:46.360 --> 03:27:51.560]  this around the holidays understand 45 days is the maximum amount of time if nobody if they
[03:27:51.560 --> 03:27:55.880]  wanted to delay this thing they could take that long but if they want to go right away to a vote
[03:27:55.880 --> 03:28:00.600]  and why wouldn't they paul ryanow supports it mich mcconnell supports it obama supports it
[03:28:01.400 --> 03:28:07.000]  so it could be passed by them immediately now the the president can't sign it for 90 days but he
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:12.680]  sorry said he's going to sign it that's a non uh issue the issue is whether it will pass through
[03:28:12.680 --> 03:28:19.480]  congress there will be no amendments there will be no filibusters they will have 20 hours maximum
[03:28:19.480 --> 03:28:24.200]  to talk about this when it is put through that was the uh that was what was agreed to with the
[03:28:24.200 --> 03:28:28.600]  trade promotion authority so there is not going to be any way to delay this thing once it comes to
[03:28:28.600 --> 03:28:33.640]  the floor and it can come to the floor anytime 30 days after today so we could look at early
[03:28:33.640 --> 03:28:37.640]  december where this could happen the only person that i've seen so far this had a reaction to this
[03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:43.560]  is senator sander uh sanders bernie sanders uh sandernista the socialist he is right on a lot
[03:28:43.560 --> 03:28:49.800]  of things he is right on civil liberties issues he is right on this tpp he doesn't support it for
[03:28:49.800 --> 03:28:54.920]  some of the reasons that many of us do but uh are opposed i should say for for some of the reasons
[03:28:54.920 --> 03:29:00.280]  but he is right in terms of the fact that's going to set up a global governance he says the text of
[03:29:00.280 --> 03:29:04.440]  the trans-specific partnership has finally been released it's even worse than i thought it's clear
[03:29:04.440 --> 03:29:10.920]  to me the proposed agreement is not nor has it ever been the gold standard of trade agreements well
[03:29:11.560 --> 03:29:15.800]  he addresses a few of the points that are there just as senator sessions you got somebody who's
[03:29:15.800 --> 03:29:22.040]  one of the most conservative senators in congress senator sessions and somebody who is arguably
[03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:29.720]  one of the most liberal bernie sanders both saying this is bad because we're losing control of our
[03:29:29.720 --> 03:29:35.560]  economy to multinational corporations and the committees that they've set up in secret in
[03:29:35.560 --> 03:29:46.520]  this agreement we ought to start paying attention folks stay with us we'll be right back
[03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:54.520]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:54.520 --> 03:30:06.280]  in florida they called me jeb because i earned it poor jeb i got a lot of really cool things
[03:30:06.280 --> 03:30:10.840]  that i could do other than sit around being miserable jeb just got some more bad news while
[03:30:10.840 --> 03:30:15.880]  both trump and karsten would beat hillary in florida former florida governor jeb would lose to
[03:30:15.880 --> 03:30:23.320]  hillary in the republican leaning state and with that news jeb's exclamation mark went
[03:30:23.320 --> 03:30:29.080]  completely flaccid and his comments got even stranger i love my dad i'd kill for him i'd go
[03:30:29.080 --> 03:30:33.240]  to prison for him because i love him so much well i'm sure that comes up around the bush dinner
[03:30:33.240 --> 03:30:38.920]  table but come on the bushes just like the clinton's are too big to jail they call me veto corleone

[03:33:24.440 --> 03:33:29.640]  people about this article that came out today multiple reports about doctors without borders
[03:33:30.280 --> 03:33:34.920]  final report about this shooting in the kunduz hospital and of course what they're reporting
[03:33:34.920 --> 03:33:42.200]  now is that many staff described seeing people being shot most likely from a plane as people tried
[03:33:42.200 --> 03:33:46.360]  to flee the main hospital building that was being hit with each airstrike some accounts
[03:33:46.360 --> 03:33:52.200]  mentioned shootings that appear to follow the movements of the people who were running doctors
[03:33:52.200 --> 03:33:57.960]  without borders doctors and other medical staff were shot while running to reach safety in a
[03:33:57.960 --> 03:34:03.880]  different part of the compound well absolutely amazing jacari this is an attack that went on
[03:34:03.880 --> 03:34:11.720]  for a half hour okay they had notified american government and afghan government officials telling
[03:34:11.720 --> 03:34:15.800]  them giving them the gps coordinates telling them that this was a hospital as they point out here
[03:34:15.800 --> 03:34:20.040]  the facility which opened in 2011 was the only one of its kind in the region it had performed
[03:34:20.040 --> 03:34:26.200]  more than 15 000 surgeries since its opening the report said it was also the only one of
[03:34:26.200 --> 03:34:30.360]  the only buildings in the city that had full electricity from generator power on the night
[03:34:30.360 --> 03:34:35.240]  of the airstrikes in other words it was lit up as well and you can understand in the fog of war
[03:34:35.800 --> 03:34:40.760]  when there is a a bomb that hits a hospital that that's unavoidable that's one of the
[03:34:40.760 --> 03:34:45.880]  reasons why we need to be careful yeah absolutely night you know just casually go into war to start
[03:34:45.880 --> 03:34:48.680]  a war because we know there's going to be collateral damage there always is but when you
[03:34:48.680 --> 03:34:54.840]  have a sustained attack for a half hour this is a war crime and they pointed out in this report
[03:34:54.840 --> 03:34:58.840]  they also said no armed combatants or weapons were found within the compound no fighting in
[03:34:58.840 --> 03:35:02.520]  the drake vicinity of the hospital at the time of the airstrike there was no battle going on at
[03:35:02.520 --> 03:35:07.480]  the time either okay and we got four different stories from the american government in four
[03:35:07.480 --> 03:35:15.080]  different days and every one of those was radically different and i want to cover this
[03:35:15.080 --> 03:35:21.480]  article that i started to talk about one sunday right after this happened it was reported that
[03:35:22.040 --> 03:35:28.840]  then russia attacked nine hospitals in syria okay and i don't think that that's true i mean we
[03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:33.480]  actually picked up that story from the uh the daily caller the new york times is talking about
[03:35:33.480 --> 03:35:37.560]  the wall street journal if this is an echo that went around the world you know what they say about
[03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:41.640]  a lie it can travel around the world before the truth gets its pants on right yeah okay well
[03:35:41.640 --> 03:35:46.120]  that's what happened with us and i want to read you and break this down from tony cartelucci
[03:35:46.120 --> 03:35:51.480]  talking about the incredible expanding lie of russia's bombing of syrian hospitals now he
[03:35:51.480 --> 03:35:57.480]  points out that this information first came out on afp they called it a field hospital when it came
[03:35:57.480 --> 03:36:02.920]  like they said it was met with immediate skepticism even by critics of russia because of who was
[03:36:02.920 --> 03:36:08.680]  reporting this it was a so-called syrian observatory for human rights uh this is actually not an
[03:36:08.680 --> 03:36:15.800]  institution it is a single individual his name is rami abdel ramen he is based in the u k so he's
[03:36:15.800 --> 03:36:21.000]  not observing anything he calls it the syrian observatory for human rights but he's not observing
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:26.120]  anything he's in the u k he's been caught coordinating his reports with the foreign
[03:36:26.120 --> 03:36:31.560]  office there in london now they say the clinic in question was allegedly run by the syrian american
[03:36:31.560 --> 03:36:38.680]  medical society s a m s sam's they say it's a multi-million-dollar u.s-based ngo supported by
[03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:44.280]  the u.s state department and they've been involved in channeling money to terrorist organizations
[03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:52.040]  like most of the american organizations ngo's state department uh facilities have been doing that to
[03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:57.400]  so-called moderate rebels that now we learn you know of course our al-nusra their al-qaeda their isis
[03:36:57.400 --> 03:37:02.360]  absolutely and then this goes on jikari it says that uh our initial reports from the ground show
[03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:06.680]  that we have lost two hospital staff a physiotherapist and a nurse but they spoke in condition of
[03:37:06.680 --> 03:37:10.920]  anonymity and they would not specify whether or not these strikes were even conducted by russian
[03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:16.280]  warplanes but then it got picked up the international business times picked up an article russian
[03:37:16.280 --> 03:37:22.040]  airstrike hits hospitals in syria so that's not one it goes from one to three then to four then it
[03:37:22.040 --> 03:37:27.720]  goes to seven and then by the time we picked it up it was up to nine okay and that's where this
[03:37:27.720 --> 03:37:32.600]  this thing traveled around everybody started piling on to this and then after several days of this
[03:37:32.600 --> 03:37:37.160]  russia came out and said all right we've been hearing this narrative uh from nato countries
[03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:43.160]  show us the evidence or shut up and they shut up they shut up that's simple exactly it's just that
[03:37:43.160 --> 03:37:49.880]  simple but that's what we see going on that's how lies spread through the media and speaking of lies
[03:37:49.880 --> 03:37:55.640]  let's talk about this uh uh what came out with uh jeb bush's dad he's just released his book
[03:37:56.520 --> 03:38:01.480]  and of course they say after years of holding back former president george hw bush has finally
[03:38:01.480 --> 03:38:06.040]  broken his public silence about key figures in his son's administration so jikari i think at this
[03:38:06.040 --> 03:38:12.760]  point in time they expected that jeb would still be a player in the election okay yeah he had a
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:17.560]  good thing to tack it on to him exactly so he comes out and he attacks cheney says cheney built
[03:38:17.560 --> 03:38:23.560]  his own empire he says of rumsfeld i don't like what he did i think it hurt the president uh he
[03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:28.520]  says uh he became very hard-lined very different from the dick cheney than i knew he says i was
[03:38:28.520 --> 03:38:32.680]  never close to him anyway there's a lack of humility a lack of seeing what the other guy thinks
[03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:37.080]  he's more kickass and take names take numbers i think he paid a price for that rumsfeld was an
[03:38:37.080 --> 03:38:42.440]  arrogant fellow i mean this is this is jeb bush's dad talking about all this stuff right and saying
[03:38:42.440 --> 03:38:48.760]  that uh you know these guys they undermined his previous son because you know w got us into the
[03:38:48.760 --> 03:38:54.520]  war in rock and everybody knows now it's a well-established fact that they lied to get us
[03:38:54.520 --> 03:38:59.000]  into that war yeah because i believe the the very famous clip is rumsfeld i think there's a clip
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:03.800]  with cheney too but rumsfeld saying we know they have weapons of mass destruction yeah you know
[03:39:03.800 --> 03:39:09.000]  and this you have a similar clip with cheney yeah and all these guys who were in on it so
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:14.680]  uh of course it makes them look bad and i know uh bush senior also didn't like uh cheney because
[03:39:14.680 --> 03:39:18.920]  his views on the cia some of the things he let slip us surrounding those guys so of course being a
[03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:24.040]  big cia proponent he wasn't a fan of cheney yeah so he's gonna throw these guys on the bus in order
[03:39:24.040 --> 03:39:28.920]  to save jeb and i think they knew i mean they have to have a large lead time with us just those
[03:39:28.920 --> 03:39:33.640]  shows how carefully they orchestrate all this stuff okay they have this book that's gonna come out
[03:39:33.640 --> 03:39:39.640]  where the dad dumps on the people who undermined and messed up w's administration okay it wasn't
[03:39:39.640 --> 03:39:45.240]  his fault and yet we know just just as we had this uh a couple of clips uh i did one as a one minute
[03:39:45.240 --> 03:39:51.160]  darin mcbreen did another one where he put in the quote from uh w you know he tried to kill my dad
[03:39:51.160 --> 03:39:56.360]  talking about saddam hussein right and just this last week we had jeb say i love my dad i'd kill
[03:39:56.360 --> 03:40:01.800]  for my dad i'd go to prison for my dad of course they would exactly not that that would ever happen
[03:40:01.800 --> 03:40:06.440]  well yes exactly that yeah no no bushes are going to go to prison anymore than any clintons are going
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:12.040]  to go to prison but of course jacari he would send you to die oh yes okay he would send your son to
[03:40:12.040 --> 03:40:16.600]  die in a foreign war that uh we don't have any business in getting it and then of course there's
[03:40:16.600 --> 03:40:22.600]  this whole nonsense about how w wasn't responsible for this it was it was rumsfeld and cheney who
[03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:27.960]  were responsible for this let me read you what jeb said jeb is trying to get tough okay and here's a
[03:40:27.960 --> 03:40:32.520]  here's an article from the weekly standard jeb tries shouting and you can see the pictures of jeb
[03:40:32.520 --> 03:40:39.000]  he's now appearing without a tie without even a jacket because his new slogan is jeb can fix it
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:45.960]  okay he's no longer part of a political dynasty he's a plumber now exactly he's now every man okay
[03:40:45.960 --> 03:40:52.360]  he's one of us because we can't because he's not wearing a tie or or jacket and uh his slogan is
[03:40:52.360 --> 03:40:57.080]  jeb can fix it but this is what he said he said the president can't say it's somebody else's fault
[03:40:57.080 --> 03:41:01.480]  president can't say you're fired and go to a commercial break okay and that's always my issue
[03:41:01.480 --> 03:41:05.400]  with these guys because i talked to people about vietnam and of course there's a lot of things going
[03:41:05.400 --> 03:41:10.840]  on before we got involved but you have uh who was a McNamara telling lbj and there's actually this
[03:41:10.840 --> 03:41:15.320]  thing i don't anybody who hasn't been awesome there's an lbj museum and there's this thing i didn't
[03:41:15.320 --> 03:41:18.920]  want to go in there somebody dragged me in there but there's this thing where you're supposed to be
[03:41:18.920 --> 03:41:23.160]  lbj on the phone with McNamara given the information that you were given at the time
[03:41:23.160 --> 03:41:27.560]  he says mr president i am the golfer talking incident and then you have these options right
[03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:31.480]  then you have to choose what you're going to do and of course knowing what i know i choose not to
[03:41:31.480 --> 03:41:37.080]  invade vietnam and because i did that the planet was destroyed according to this uh sensational
[03:41:37.080 --> 03:41:43.000]  thing to have up there but uh to my point on vietnam you know what jeb is saying they can't
[03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:47.160]  say anybody was wrong let's say lbj knew nothing about it he would just read off a press release
[03:41:47.160 --> 03:41:51.640]  of those guys handed to him afterwards you have guys like McNamara who go on book tours saying
[03:41:51.640 --> 03:41:55.560]  that all this stuff they knew was fraudulent it was wrong he said it was a mistake to go in
[03:41:55.560 --> 03:42:01.240]  admitting that nobody but nobody went to prison that's the issue with these presidencies and this
[03:42:01.240 --> 03:42:05.080]  unaccountability yeah i'd say the president didn't know but when the truth comes out somebody
[03:42:05.080 --> 03:42:09.400]  needs to go to prison absolutely you're talking about that and in that documentary there on morris
[03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:15.240]  the fog of war uh robert magnum era shortly before he died said uh yeah we knew that that
[03:42:15.240 --> 03:42:19.640]  it really wasn't an attack in the gulf of tunken you know we lied about that and he talked though
[03:42:19.640 --> 03:42:23.960]  he didn't say you know that well we should go to prison because we started the vietnam war
[03:42:23.960 --> 03:42:28.040]  what he said was we should go to prison because of the fire bombings that we conducted in japan
[03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:33.080]  yeah because he knows that nobody's going to send him to prison for for world war two that was
[03:42:33.880 --> 03:42:38.600]  most people's minds a just war that was that most people looked at that as you know we were
[03:42:38.600 --> 03:42:43.080]  we were attacked without provocation and we defended ourselves and so forth so he could safely say
[03:42:43.080 --> 03:42:46.360]  well we should have gone to jail as war criminals in world war two he wouldn't say we should go to
[03:42:46.360 --> 03:42:50.920]  jail as war criminals for vietnam because we might take him up on that offer oh yes and he also
[03:42:50.920 --> 03:42:56.760]  pointed out in that documentary that when he met with people from north vietnam uh decades later
[03:42:56.760 --> 03:43:00.920]  they were slamming their fist on the table and said you idiot we fought the chinese for independence
[03:43:00.920 --> 03:43:05.480]  all this whole thing about the domino theory is total nonsense and so yeah absolutely i guess i
[03:43:05.480 --> 03:43:09.960]  don't know what jeb is going to fix you know he's got the the fix it bus he's he's gotten rid of his
[03:43:09.960 --> 03:43:15.720]  black blackened out suv he's now got a bus so he can bring the press on and he can be warm and
[03:43:15.720 --> 03:43:20.360]  inviting okay and he's got on the side of the bus jeb can fix it so i don't know if the bus is
[03:43:20.360 --> 03:43:24.680]  he's gonna fix his own campaign before he goes out there and fixes the country yeah also the problem
[03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:31.960]  is jacari he doesn't even know what is broken okay the public knows that our borders are broken
[03:43:31.960 --> 03:43:36.760]  but jeb doesn't want to fix that okay and they know a lot of other things are broken they know
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:40.760]  that common core is broken but jeb doesn't want to fix that he doesn't want to fix the mistakes of
[03:43:40.760 --> 03:43:46.600]  his own family yeah well he worked with bill gates to enact a common core curriculum and of course
[03:43:46.600 --> 03:43:51.000]  that's what he said was uh you know oh well you know the the money that we gave ten million dollars
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:55.080]  playing parenthood but but we were actually trying to promote common core and it's like really that's
[03:43:56.120 --> 03:44:00.680]  come back in the debate let's take a look at some of the things that were in we were in the news
[03:44:00.680 --> 03:44:08.920]  today our info wars site here bill mower was making fun of info wars it was reporting on the story
[03:44:08.920 --> 03:44:15.160]  that bacon gives you cancer and his take on it was well okay i guess uh now people are going to
[03:44:15.160 --> 03:44:18.840]  say well cancer is not a problem because they're not about to give up their bacon so what they
[03:44:18.840 --> 03:44:25.720]  did was they photoshopped a ridiculous headline cancer is it bad for you or is it a government
[03:44:25.720 --> 03:44:29.960]  hoax and they put info wars up on top of that as you can see right there let's run that clip and
[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:35.800]  then we'll talk about it new rule now that they've declared that bacon causes cancer the world health
[03:44:35.800 --> 03:44:41.080]  organization must face the fact that instead of reconsidering bacon most americans are going to
[03:44:41.080 --> 03:44:50.040]  reconsider cancer i can see it now on the websites that real americans read cancer bed for you or
[03:44:50.040 --> 03:44:56.120]  government hoax cancer eat all the bacon you want and still lose weight and you know who
[03:44:56.120 --> 03:45:02.200]  else's cells mutate uncontrollably the x-men there you go so you guys put us up there with
[03:45:02.200 --> 03:45:06.840]  fox and red state so the thing about that is just like i believe in the article they have it linked
[03:45:06.840 --> 03:45:10.840]  i think it was comedy central did a piece as well when they put us in with michael jackson
[03:45:10.840 --> 03:45:15.080]  me abducted by aliens or whatever else a lot of times they won't even attack us for stuff that we
[03:45:15.080 --> 03:45:20.200]  say or that alex says they have to go make up something that's completely ridiculous so their
[03:45:20.200 --> 03:45:25.160]  viewers who'd have no idea about info wars they just hear negative things will think oh these guys
[03:45:25.160 --> 03:45:30.200]  saying cancer is a conspiracy theory as if yeah people don't have cancer yeah exactly like rachel
[03:45:30.200 --> 03:45:34.840]  mowdow would say yeah these guys believe that somebody had a plunger that took down you know
[03:45:34.840 --> 03:45:40.760]  the yeah the giant wasp in the in the pentagon exactly exactly so they build a straw man they
[03:45:40.760 --> 03:45:47.080]  do it and they say oh you know it's just comedy no it's just psychological propaganda is what it
[03:45:47.080 --> 03:45:52.040]  really is that's what's really behind all of this when they do this they are associating this uh
[03:45:52.680 --> 03:45:58.520]  this nonsense with with our logo but that's all right just spell the name correctly bill uh yeah
[03:45:58.520 --> 03:46:04.760]  people go check it out when they google they find out that it has no basis in reality exactly uh now
[03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:09.480]  of course in terms of that we've got this new documentary that's going to be coming out from
[03:46:09.480 --> 03:46:15.160]  disney i talked about that beginning of the uh this hour abagail abagail disney the grand niece
[03:46:15.160 --> 03:46:20.520]  of walt disney is going to examine in this documentary this is a story from w&d uh sharyl
[03:46:20.520 --> 03:46:26.040]  chumlee it's going to examine if pro gun people can simultaneously be pro life they think that
[03:46:26.040 --> 03:46:31.640]  there's some kind of an inherent uh conflict there you know this is really uh a propaganda
[03:46:31.640 --> 03:46:38.120]  documentary they say we are experienced this film through the eyes of two evangelical christians
[03:46:38.120 --> 03:46:42.360]  who are determined to make a change in this country's gun policy and they call the film
[03:46:42.360 --> 03:46:47.560]  armor of light it's about the issue of guns but it's also a document about christian life in
[03:46:47.560 --> 03:46:53.000]  america at this heightened moment of political discontent and i'll read one more excerpt from this
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:58.840]  and get your uh comments on this shakari they say this documentary digs into the deep affinity
[03:46:58.840 --> 03:47:03.800]  between the evangelical christian movement and our country's gun culture and how one
[03:47:03.800 --> 03:47:10.360]  top minister and anti-abortion activists undergo a change of consciousness to challenge
[03:47:10.360 --> 03:47:16.440]  prevailing attitudes toward firearms among fellow christians how's that well you know the
[03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:21.160]  issue about this is anybody who actually reads the bible can come across the passage where christ
[03:47:21.160 --> 03:47:26.600]  told his followers to go buy swords now be very clear he didn't say go out buy swords and kill a
[03:47:26.600 --> 03:47:31.720]  bunch of people he said go out and have this means of self-defense if necessary and even going as far
[03:47:31.720 --> 03:47:38.040]  as saying sell your cloak if you need to have this means of defense so to say that it's somehow
[03:47:38.040 --> 03:47:42.680]  un christian to be armed is completely ridiculous king david he goes out to war was he take he
[03:47:42.680 --> 03:47:47.400]  takes his sword yeah he takes the armaments of the day to go out and fight the battle so to say
[03:47:47.400 --> 03:47:52.760]  that owning a firearm is un christian is completely ridiculous yeah exactly uh jesus told his apostles
[03:47:52.760 --> 03:47:58.840]  to sell their cloak and get a sword but again the broader principle of that is that we are to protect
[03:47:58.840 --> 03:48:04.760]  innocent life okay that's that's the fundamental thing if you have it within your power to protect
[03:48:04.760 --> 03:48:09.640]  innocent life and you don't do it i mean that that's an excusable i mean you know paul says if you
[03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:14.600]  don't take care of your own then you're worse than an infidel you've defa you've denied the faith
[03:48:14.600 --> 03:48:19.880]  in other words you have a responsibility to help the the weak the defenseless anyone that you can
[03:48:19.880 --> 03:48:25.080]  help you have a responsibility to do that and that's precisely what the guy that i talked to
[03:48:25.080 --> 03:48:30.360]  from south africa he was a uh a minister there he was visiting another church it wasn't his church
[03:48:30.360 --> 03:48:35.960]  his name was uh uh charl fun vic i have to think about that because it's a different pronunciation
[03:48:35.960 --> 03:48:42.440]  from south africa and he had i think it was five shots in his pistol and he always carried a pistol
[03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:47.400]  because at the time south africa was undergoing a you know a violent revolution there with the
[03:48:48.200 --> 03:48:51.720]  the forces of mandela and the government were fighting each other and there were gorillas
[03:48:51.720 --> 03:48:55.640]  who were going around shooting people up and they learned afterwards because they had a truth
[03:48:55.640 --> 03:48:59.800]  and reconciliation committee where they brought these guys in who had shot that church up they
[03:48:59.800 --> 03:49:04.040]  learned afterwards these guys were able to confess because they weren't going to be prosecuted for
[03:49:04.040 --> 03:49:08.280]  anything that they said and they said we picked that church of about a thousand people because
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:13.240]  we knew it was in a wealthy liberal neighborhood and we knew nobody would be armed and we were
[03:49:13.240 --> 03:49:19.240]  surprised when we started getting shot yeah this guy was all the way up in the back corner of this
[03:49:19.240 --> 03:49:24.040]  mega church and these guys came in they killed quite a few people i can't remember the exact
[03:49:24.040 --> 03:49:29.880]  number i think it was around 40 or 50 people they came in throwing grenades and shooting with uh
[03:49:30.760 --> 03:49:35.720]  ak-47s and this guy only had a pistol he was all the way in the back so he took a couple of shots
[03:49:35.720 --> 03:49:41.800]  uh and he didn't think he hit anything from that angle so he went outside and came back around
[03:49:41.800 --> 03:49:46.200]  another way and they were dragging one of their comrades out who had actually had hit somebody
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:50.920]  he'd one of his bullets had got one of the guys so they were surprised that they were under fire
[03:49:50.920 --> 03:49:56.120]  they pulled this guy out and then he took some more shots at him uh from the other angle and
[03:49:56.120 --> 03:50:01.160]  i think got another guy and they thought that there were multiple people yeah so they left
[03:50:01.160 --> 03:50:06.600]  he saved all of those people's lives because and he said that he had struggled with this very
[03:50:06.600 --> 03:50:12.120]  issue at first he thought no no as a christian i shouldn't carry a gun because i might put myself
[03:50:12.120 --> 03:50:17.800]  in the situation where i might harm somebody but that's the issue guns can save lives in the hands
[03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:23.480]  of a good person they are a means of defense of self-defense and of the defense of others
[03:50:23.480 --> 03:50:30.280]  and it is precisely uh that way that guns can save lives yeah i agree with that statement 100
[03:50:30.280 --> 03:50:34.600]  percent you know like i said it's about defense you know we're not telling anybody go out there
[03:50:34.600 --> 03:50:39.240]  and have offensive violence not at all but we're saying if the situation does arise when you're
[03:50:39.960 --> 03:50:43.560]  carjacked or you know at the grocery store or whatever it's my pulls out a gun at the gas station
[03:50:43.560 --> 03:50:49.800]  then you can defend yourself thanks a lot jacari and of course uh the uh nra eat bloomberg's
[03:50:49.800 --> 03:50:54.200]  administration and the way that they put out all this money they were outspent 30 to 1 and still

[03:53:06.120 --> 03:53:11.160]  had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing
[03:53:11.160 --> 03:53:16.360]  we start with food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage
[03:53:16.360 --> 03:53:21.320]  i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will i
[03:53:21.320 --> 03:53:26.040]  keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem with that
[03:53:26.040 --> 03:53:31.800]  if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another concern there may come a time
[03:53:31.800 --> 03:53:36.440]  when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you
[03:53:36.440 --> 03:53:42.440]  can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers

[03:54:18.920 --> 03:54:24.680]  trailer that's going to be previewing we're going to preview here in just a moment about this trip
[03:54:24.680 --> 03:54:30.840]  that she took to st louis the toxic waste dump that's on fire they're headed towards a nuclear
[03:54:30.840 --> 03:54:34.920]  waste dump is that correct uh and we're going to get to that just before we do though and

[03:54:58.280 --> 03:55:05.400]  we get to that i was just talking to jacari about the efforts by uh the grand niece of
[03:55:05.400 --> 03:55:09.880]  walt disney to try to convince people that gun ownership and christianity are incompatible
[03:55:09.880 --> 03:55:14.760]  with each other to attack the second amendment but of course even the first amendment is under
[03:55:14.760 --> 03:55:20.440]  attack and perhaps it's maybe in worse shape than the second amendment is this is an article here
[03:55:20.440 --> 03:55:26.040]  a poll of college students reveals little regard for free speech they went and they polled 800
[03:55:26.040 --> 03:55:31.960]  undergrads at yale university they found 30 of the students who self-identified as liberal
[03:55:31.960 --> 03:55:40.840]  believe the first amendment is outdated a majority 51 favored speech codes on the campus 16 want even
[03:55:40.840 --> 03:55:46.520]  more control of free speech they said 35 of the students stated so-called hate speech is not protected
[03:55:46.520 --> 03:55:51.640]  under the first amendment wow there you go so all you have to do is say that if something
[03:55:51.640 --> 03:55:57.240]  is racist sexist homophobic or otherwise offensive you should get disciplined for that and you
[03:55:57.240 --> 03:56:01.240]  don't get a chance to say it and of course that's anything that hurts somebody's feelings
[03:56:01.240 --> 03:56:05.560]  if they say that it hurts their feelings you don't get the chance to say that isn't america
[03:56:05.560 --> 03:56:10.200]  going to be completely different place here in just a few years it's just wild to think about
[03:56:10.200 --> 03:56:15.960]  these people getting out and being the leaders of the new world absolutely i want to before we run
[03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:19.480]  out of time i want to play this trailer of what you're going to go over tonight on the nightly
[03:56:19.480 --> 03:56:27.000]  news let's run that trailer this is uh uh what's happening in st lewis in my house was downwind
[03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:33.000]  about 1.5 miles from where the original piles set out and i was one of the children who played in
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:38.600]  the creek with my brother or all the neighborhood kids we uh we had our own forts we i mean we
[03:56:38.600 --> 03:56:44.440]  played in the creek all day in the summers we'd ice skate it during the winters we love that creek
[03:56:44.440 --> 03:56:51.320]  you know it was a really fun time and now to think that we were playing in poison just it doesn't
[03:56:51.320 --> 03:56:57.560]  really you can't take away those good memories for me so i'm still trying to hold on to some of
[03:56:57.560 --> 03:57:03.080]  the good but it's it's just mind-bending to think that here we are children we're having the time
[03:57:03.080 --> 03:57:09.800]  of our lives and and it was eventually going to kill a lot of people and we we had no idea
[03:57:12.440 --> 03:57:18.840]  in the early 1940s the nuclear arms race was on a local st lewis corporation played a significant
[03:57:18.840 --> 03:57:23.400]  role in the development of the first nuclear weapons during world war two as part of the
[03:57:23.400 --> 03:57:29.960]  manhattan project malincrot chemical works began processing their uranium for the first atomic bomb
[03:57:29.960 --> 03:57:36.120]  but by the mid 1940s the company had run out of space at its downtown st lewis location so it began
[03:57:36.120 --> 03:57:42.120]  to ship the radioactive waste offsite to an underpopulated area north of st lewis the radioactive
[03:57:42.120 --> 03:57:48.440]  materials were stored in bulk on the ground open to the elements and unattended next to cold water
[03:57:48.440 --> 03:57:58.600]  creek many people have difficulty understanding how silent invisible rays which cannot even be felt
[03:57:58.600 --> 03:58:03.640]  could be so damaging our bodies are made up of millions of cells they're the building blocks of
[03:58:03.640 --> 03:58:08.920]  our blood and tissues when radiation penetrates the body the cells are injured most of them
[03:58:08.920 --> 03:58:14.840]  can repair themselves at the total dose over a period of time is not too high but if radiation
[03:58:14.840 --> 03:58:28.120]  continues the cells will be destroyed beyond repair again that's going to premiere tonight
[03:58:28.120 --> 03:58:33.240]  that's part one of that documentary that josh owens and leon macadoo did and leon will be doing the
[03:58:33.240 --> 03:58:47.240]  news tonight join us then seven central eight p.m. eastern
