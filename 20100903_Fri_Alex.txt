[00:00.000 --> 00:13.620]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.620 --> 00:27.260]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones if you were to
[00:27.260 --> 00:31.560]  stand on a street corner hollering that the government is poisoning our water supply you'd
[00:31.560 --> 00:36.200]  probably get little more than eye rolls and head shakes but do the same thing in a radio booth
[00:36.200 --> 00:41.720]  you might just get a million listeners a day such as the case for Alex Jones a man who trades
[00:41.720 --> 00:46.160]  in such sinister conspiracy theories you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he
[00:46.160 --> 00:52.920]  says Dan Harris went to Texas to find out are you for Hitler or against Hitler whatever they
[00:52.920 --> 00:59.240]  say it's the opposite they never tell the truth to Alex Jones the world is a very dark place
[00:59.240 --> 01:04.880]  America has been captured America's being robbed we are now being looted like a third-world nation
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.480]  well I'm not gonna sit down and shut up world government means world tyranny run by a scientific
[01:09.480 --> 01:13.760]  dictatorship of control freaks that want to carry out forced population reduction do you
[01:13.760 --> 01:17.920]  actually believe everything you say I believe all of it absolutely what I'm telling is the
[01:17.920 --> 01:26.920]  truth none of it is you know a shtick a show at all no it's all true Jones is arguably the
[01:26.920 --> 01:32.920]  nation's premier purveyor of what could be called paranoia porn the Obama deception the
[01:32.920 --> 01:38.080]  truth strikes back I'm live at 30 seconds all right is six day a week radio show and
[01:38.080 --> 01:43.920]  webcast reach an estimated one million people a day this federal intrusion is out of control
[01:43.920 --> 01:49.560]  and on YouTube and elsewhere Jones estimates 200 million people have seen his various
[01:49.560 --> 01:59.320]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are live it is Friday the third day of September 2010 and
[01:59.320 --> 02:05.360]  we've had salon come out and basically attacked me yesterday the New York Times come out and
[02:05.360 --> 02:11.240]  report on us and more than a hundred newspapers I didn't even have time this morning when
[02:11.240 --> 02:17.840]  I searched my name to look at one tenth of the stories and of course last night I got
[02:17.840 --> 02:25.040]  a call from some family who noticed that on ABC nightly news they promoted the fact that
[02:25.040 --> 02:31.320]  on nightline tonight the number one purveyor of paranoia porn of course the New York Times
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.600]  and others have called Gerald Salente the purveyor of pessimism porn they said that
[02:36.600 --> 02:41.100]  what three years ago when he said that the stock market was gonna plunge that the housing
[02:41.100 --> 02:44.680]  bubble would pop and they're still calling him that when he can just look at the basic
[02:44.680 --> 02:50.560]  facts like any other economist or researcher who's telling the truth can do and this this
[02:50.560 --> 02:57.920]  hit piece is very sophisticated and a lot of times I don't cover even national television
[02:57.920 --> 03:02.280]  reports about myself just because we're too busy covering all the other important news
[03:02.280 --> 03:06.120]  but I'm going to cover this first today we're gonna get into all the news we have several
[03:06.120 --> 03:13.160]  guests on as well on the second amendment on the naked body scanners you name it coming
[03:13.160 --> 03:19.200]  up today but the reason I want to lead with this report when we come back from break is
[03:19.200 --> 03:25.520]  that it is a bird's eye view into how they manipulate how they brainwash how they condition
[03:25.520 --> 03:31.760]  people and there's so many different layers to this propaganda I mean one obvious one
[03:31.760 --> 03:38.920]  is they come in and say and use a short clip out of context where I say either Hitler is
[03:38.920 --> 03:45.080]  good or either Hitler is bad and the image and idea is basically this guy's Hitler and
[03:45.080 --> 03:48.520]  they also talk about if you're a cook on the street corner people laugh at you but if you've
[03:48.520 --> 03:55.320]  got a radio show people pay attention to you so the message is this guy's a cook but they
[03:55.320 --> 04:01.880]  were here for a whole day and I gave them documentation for everything that I covered
[04:01.880 --> 04:08.120]  and they basically implied that I'm exaggerating and making this stuff up but the most dominant
[04:08.120 --> 04:14.160]  message was over and over again is he serious does he really mean what he's saying and
[04:14.160 --> 04:23.280]  the idea is that I am a charming cook who has built this media empire and that I don't
[04:23.280 --> 04:29.400]  really believe what I'm saying well that's why we have info wars dot com and prison planet
[04:29.400 --> 04:34.560]  dot com I'd say ninety five percent of what we cover here is just open source legislation
[04:34.560 --> 04:38.680]  government documents and we're breaking it down of course I believe everything I talk
[04:38.680 --> 04:44.480]  about here on this broadcast it's all about demystifying Alex Jones it's all about especially
[04:44.480 --> 04:50.880]  saying that I'm exaggerating and hyping things and that things aren't as bad as I say and
[04:50.880 --> 04:56.640]  that oh I'm going to cause dangerous people to do violent things so so they basically
[04:56.640 --> 05:00.800]  threw the kitchen sink at me and it backfired course will be rubber Alex Jones here with

[08:14.920 --> 08:32.840]  rallying patriots worldwide you're listening to the Alex Jones show we're live it's Friday
[08:32.840 --> 08:38.840]  September 3rd 2010 coming up in about an hour and a half in studio ball velty the founder
[08:38.840 --> 08:43.720]  and the head of a wonderful second amendment organization in Texas fighting for decades
[08:43.720 --> 08:49.640]  for liberty peaceable Texas for farms rights will be in studio he's an attorney and he's
[08:49.640 --> 08:55.920]  been closely following a case that we've also been tracking here and I've met the individual
[08:55.920 --> 09:01.120]  when they wanted to shut down the gun show that had been here for close to two decades
[09:01.120 --> 09:08.040]  in north Austin they would send in stings of illegal aliens with Texas IDs saying they
[09:08.040 --> 09:14.080]  were citizens and it's legal and lawful to then sell in a private sale of you say you're
[09:14.080 --> 09:17.880]  a citizen and the person selling to you isn't a gun dealer just a private citizen selling
[09:17.880 --> 09:23.080]  their firearms they call it the gun show loophole to sell but they don't care and I see this
[09:23.080 --> 09:30.000]  all the time people are convicted of things that are not illegal I have seen cases where
[09:30.000 --> 09:37.400]  people have been indicted and it's gone to court and the judge has instructed the jury
[09:37.400 --> 09:40.840]  that they have committed a crime and basically told the jury to convict him which judges
[09:40.840 --> 09:45.880]  aren't supposed to do in the case of Kelly rushing handing out a VHS tape this was eight
[09:45.880 --> 09:52.640]  years ago back when VHS was still around a VHS tape with Ron Paul 45 minute speech called
[09:52.640 --> 09:59.440]  neocond on the house floor and my film road to tyranny and he was charged with two counts
[09:59.440 --> 10:04.520]  of threatening law enforcement they said Ron Paul speech was threatening this was in the
[10:04.520 --> 10:10.280]  newspapers in Kentucky like it with a straight face like it was reasonable not like hey this
[10:10.280 --> 10:17.220]  is the Soviet Union this is wrong no the news was thank goodness that Kelly rushing no criminal
[10:17.220 --> 10:23.160]  record upstanding family business owner would walk up to state police and give them the
[10:23.160 --> 10:27.680]  video and say please watch this is important for you and your family and they said that
[10:27.680 --> 10:32.560]  it was a threat to law enforcement and disrespectful so he was charged with being disrespectful
[10:32.560 --> 10:38.560]  and that's what the judge said but the actual charge was terroristic threats and it went
[10:38.560 --> 10:45.560]  to the jury and they said no on both counts not in the case of this gentleman and Paul
[10:45.560 --> 10:49.920]  Belty is going to be covering it today he's got a press release that he called me last
[10:49.920 --> 10:54.960]  night with and he wanted us to post it in full wars dot com and the headline is feds
[10:54.960 --> 11:00.840]  convict Texan for selling a gun to an illegal alien with Texas driver's license and they
[11:00.840 --> 11:06.960]  used this to then shut down the gun show they had threatened the owners of the venue that
[11:06.960 --> 11:13.240]  were leasing the space once a month to the saxet great folks and when that when the intimidation
[11:13.240 --> 11:19.760]  would work they just stage this event and it's absolutely terrible this poor man is
[11:19.760 --> 11:25.920]  facing what is it six months in a quote federal work camp is a probably got to Bastrop out
[11:25.920 --> 11:31.280]  there almost built onto the side of the military base the federal correctional facility and
[11:31.280 --> 11:37.680]  camp swift is one of their little work camps so we're going to be discussing that coming
[11:37.680 --> 11:45.640]  up I've also got a guest on who came up with these and I think it's a genius idea number
[11:45.640 --> 11:53.440]  one I'm not going through a naked body scanner kind of like with the thumb scanners a lot
[11:53.440 --> 11:58.720]  of people say well if you've got a thumb scan to get a driver's license all you've got to
[11:58.720 --> 12:02.240]  do is put super glue on your thumb and then they're not going to get a real thumb scan
[12:02.240 --> 12:06.840]  and people do that but a couple of layers of super glue and it looks clear but it blocks
[12:06.840 --> 12:11.600]  out the scan the people aren't paying attention behind the counter I went ahead and got a
[12:11.600 --> 12:16.000]  license about five years ago I'd gone for six years without one and it was causing a
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.120]  real problem to fly and get my job done so in this whole secret police grid I just went
[12:21.120 --> 12:24.280]  ahead and walked in and barely put my thumb down and they didn't even pay attention if
[12:24.280 --> 12:28.560]  they didn't get a scan I mean I wasn't even really touching I just barely put it on there
[12:28.560 --> 12:33.640]  and I'll guarantee you they didn't get a scan but that's one way to do it but but I recommend
[12:33.640 --> 12:40.120]  legislation against the illegal federal ID cards that's what I think is important is
[12:40.120 --> 12:44.520]  not trying to get around things I mean you can do that while you're at it but the main
[12:44.520 --> 12:49.440]  attack is pointing out this is a police state has nothing to do with stopping illegals as
[12:49.440 --> 12:53.480]  they rolled it out across the country back in the mid 90s claiming it was for that you've
[12:53.480 --> 12:57.000]  obviously noticed it's not for that they're issued their separate consulate matriculas
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.280]  and are above the law but they've come out with underwear for men and women with scanner
[13:03.280 --> 13:11.280]  proof it's impregnated I guess with lead or I'll ask the inventor later I'm not quite
[13:11.280 --> 13:15.120]  sure some type of metal and it does work and it blocks out the scanners so the perverts
[13:15.120 --> 13:19.560]  in the government don't get shots of your genitals that's some granny panties right
[13:19.560 --> 13:24.960]  there ladies and gentlemen that'll be a YouTube hit right there so we've got a guest popping
[13:24.960 --> 13:32.560]  in on this subject later perhaps I'll have some of the staff where these on your head
[13:32.560 --> 13:38.000]  you know to protect you from the radiation as well alright that's enough and they come
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.440]  in multiple colors and I'm trying to get these folks as a sponsor but the point is
[13:44.440 --> 13:49.400]  is that I hope this catches on because it'll make the TSA really angry they'll probably
[13:49.400 --> 13:52.520]  say oh no you're not allowed to cover your genitals up you know they already lied and
[13:52.520 --> 13:56.480]  said we can't see your genitals now they admit they look at the genitals to make sure it's
[13:56.480 --> 14:01.760]  tuned they look for those details as part of their handbook and they are saving all the
[14:01.760 --> 14:07.680]  images they lied about that but oh here's another one this is hands covering up your
[14:07.680 --> 14:14.400]  genitals it's again imprinted on the underwear pretty soon they'll say this is paraphernalia
[14:14.400 --> 14:18.680]  again it's illegal probably you know you've got to let the devils in the government homeland
[14:18.680 --> 14:25.520]  security do all of this okay let me stop screwing around here because this is a serious radio
[14:25.520 --> 14:35.440]  transmission and we are dealing with serious issues here we have seen a mega hit piece
[14:35.440 --> 14:44.040]  by nightline nightline is the most viewed television news program broadcast television
[14:44.040 --> 14:50.000]  it reaches conservatively seven million people a night that's that's conservatively what it
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.160]  reaches and they also I'm told have been airing pieces of this on the ABC nightly news I'm
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.840]  kind of proud of myself it was about 930 when I got word that about an hour 1030 central
[15:01.840 --> 15:08.640]  time nightline was coming on it took my wife and I about an hour to get the television
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.920]  set working for us to be able to even watch it after the children have been put to bed
[15:13.920 --> 15:20.040]  it took an hour to get the TV working to watch television that'll give you an idea how much
[15:20.040 --> 15:25.120]  TV I watch in the garage where I run on the treadmill almost every morning the only way
[15:25.120 --> 15:30.840]  I can make myself run is to watch movies typically action movies things like that so I can kind
[15:30.840 --> 15:38.000]  of shift into suspended disbelief and forget that I'm jogging something I hate to do so
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.400]  I I I do probably watch 45 minutes a day of television and it's just always with propaganda
[15:43.400 --> 15:47.360]  and conditioning and I do learn quite a bit about what the system is doing and I do watch
[15:47.360 --> 15:53.120]  excise clips of a spectrum of international television national local television on YouTube
[15:53.120 --> 15:57.520]  and Google every day and I send those select clips of things that I think are important
[15:57.520 --> 16:02.000]  to Curtin M. O. Paul Watson Steve Watson Aaron Dykes via I am or I call them and say post
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.240]  this place so so I am watching television I am up on what they're doing I tend to watch
[16:06.240 --> 16:15.320]  boil downs of it so I did spend an hour and we were we were able to tune in with the to
[16:15.320 --> 16:21.240]  the digital TV with the digital rabbit ears and actually a catch what was going on there
[16:21.240 --> 16:27.600]  on nightline and I was a little concerned because there's been some vicious hit pieces
[16:27.600 --> 16:33.480]  in the past that do the old frontal assault this guy wants to kill cops this guy might
[16:33.480 --> 16:38.720]  be a secret white supremacist this guy might be in league with Chinese jet pilots from
[16:38.720 --> 16:45.000]  Pluto you know this guy believes in Chewbacca brothers and aliens I mean they've that's
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.800]  one of their most popular disinfo things is that I'm a UFOologist when we don't even
[16:48.800 --> 16:55.880]  cover that here when he's not covering Chewbacca bros and little green men he thinks the government's
[16:55.880 --> 17:05.360]  poisoning your water this piece is more sophisticated number one with these TV pieces they must
[17:05.360 --> 17:14.440]  put an obesity lens on me I mean I'm not svelte I'm not to Tweet as fat bastard would say
[17:14.440 --> 17:25.960]  in one of those what were those stupid movies the where they make jokes about Austin Powers
[17:25.960 --> 17:39.520]  yes but certainly they put the they put the fat bleeper lens on me every time I'm on television
[17:39.520 --> 17:44.200]  and I know what these hundred thousand dollar cameras do if they're tuned right it actually
[17:44.200 --> 17:47.840]  doesn't add ten pounds to you but they do something that always adds about twenty pounds
[17:47.840 --> 17:53.560]  to me which I always think is comical so they did that they did unflattering shots anybody
[17:53.560 --> 18:02.520]  that's in television knows this they did some basic stuff like that they put this out of
[18:02.520 --> 18:08.040]  context clip where I said either Hitler's good or Hitler's bad giving you the idea
[18:08.040 --> 18:13.840]  that I'm into Hitler they use some fascist looking iconography from the Obama deception
[18:13.840 --> 18:20.120]  to describe that's when I'm pushing when I'm actually showing the globalist in a fascist
[18:20.120 --> 18:27.920]  light with fascist looking graphics so there's all the visual things they were doing and
[18:27.920 --> 18:35.200]  they of course prejudice the entire piece in the opening salvo by saying you know somebody
[18:35.200 --> 18:39.760]  screaming this on a street corner you just think oh this guy's a lunatic cook and keep
[18:39.760 --> 18:44.200]  walking and shake your head but this guy's got a radio show at least reaching a million
[18:44.200 --> 18:48.720]  people a day that's what I told him two million a day that's what our analysis shows but they
[18:48.720 --> 18:52.960]  went out and researched they think it's a million a day whatever and we told him two
[18:52.960 --> 18:58.320]  hundred million just in my films being seen on YouTube and Google it's probably three
[18:58.320 --> 19:02.280]  hundred four hundred million we don't know if you count everything and so they played
[19:02.280 --> 19:06.600]  that down as well but but still oh he reaches a lot of people he's dangerous and he's the
[19:06.600 --> 19:16.040]  purveyor of pessimism porn or or or a new term paranoia porn I'm sorry that's Gerald
[19:16.040 --> 19:20.600]  Salente and others that criticize derivatives and the end of the Glass-Steagall Act and
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.720]  private banks being able to issue trillions and fake counterfeit money they call that pessimism
[19:25.720 --> 19:30.240]  porn if you criticize government or the economy or unemployment or toxic waste or the Gulf

[24:02.560 --> 24:16.120]  I mean there are so many things different layers and systems of visual and audio disinformation
[24:16.120 --> 24:22.000]  this piece you could teach an entire semester college course just on this six and a half
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.680]  minutes this is this is a wonderful way to educate people and they had a lot of different
[24:27.680 --> 24:33.000]  messages but Alex is going to cause violence Alex doesn't really mean what he's saying
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.040]  he exaggerates you know we're going to find out does he really believe what he's saying
[24:38.040 --> 24:42.600]  it goes on and on and on and I was honest with him I said well sometimes I overstate
[24:42.600 --> 24:47.200]  things but not on purpose but most of the time I underestimate things and our viewers
[24:47.200 --> 24:52.200]  and listeners over the years have learned that it's almost always worse than we first
[24:52.200 --> 24:56.040]  thought I mean that's what government these corrupt corporations are involved in they've
[24:56.040 --> 24:59.640]  gotten so accustomed to doing whatever they want getting away with it that the sky is
[24:59.640 --> 25:07.400]  the limit and it just went on and on and on with different layers of it and you know
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.040]  showing me is jovial and always happy and has three children see things really aren't
[25:12.040 --> 25:17.180]  that bad no things are great on this planet life is wonderful we're defending the good
[25:17.180 --> 25:24.880]  things by fighting back against this corruption but here is one of the key points of the overarching
[25:24.880 --> 25:31.400]  system I had Dan Harris the host of ABC Nightly News he's one of the main host he's the official
[25:31.400 --> 25:37.040]  weekend anchor I took him in and showed him Herman von Roompi calling for world government
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.120]  head of the EU Gordon Brown this was they were here six months ago still prime minister
[25:41.120 --> 25:45.640]  of England I gave him Roth Copps article ahead of the Kissinger group in the Washington
[25:45.640 --> 25:50.440]  Post superclass admitting there's a world government I gave him and now for world government
[25:50.440 --> 25:54.240]  financial times of London by their foreign editor admitting it is an authoritarian secret
[25:54.240 --> 25:58.320]  government it is world government it's for your own good I and he would just laugh at
[25:58.320 --> 26:02.240]  it and say they don't really mean the world government you mean and I would give him government
[26:02.240 --> 26:06.360]  documents where they were talking about putting things in the water to sterilize us a reduced
[26:06.360 --> 26:10.320]  fertility and I gave him documents about the flu shot causing convulsions and Guillain
[26:10.320 --> 26:15.840]  Moray and everything now confirm of the British Medical Journal in the EU Commission I mean
[26:15.840 --> 26:20.440]  it's now admitted wasn't six months ago we just had all the medical experts on to cover
[26:20.440 --> 26:24.440]  it and read the inserts on air I mean the inserts admitted now it's admitted mainstream
[26:24.440 --> 26:30.120]  news and he would not put any of that in the piece it's just their credibility up against
[26:30.120 --> 26:38.440]  mine their ABC news their slick and I'm saying look you guys have gone from denying world
[26:38.440 --> 26:43.840]  government exist to saying okay it exists but it isn't nefarious I mean it's Wall
[26:43.840 --> 26:49.440]  Street Journal New York Times time magazine everywhere world government world government
[26:49.440 --> 26:55.320]  literally thousands of articles in one week last year when they had the G20 in Pittsburgh
[26:55.320 --> 27:00.840]  we did the Google search on air in news thousands of articles saying world government almost
[27:00.840 --> 27:08.400]  all of them saying how good it was in one week thousands thousands and they were here
[27:08.400 --> 27:13.760]  just right after that and I was showing them this stacks of news I tried to give them stacks
[27:13.760 --> 27:20.240]  of videos and they just would laugh at me and that day while they were here I even knew
[27:20.240 --> 27:25.960]  what they do I went to dinner with them afterwards and I said please don't say that I just had
[27:25.960 --> 27:33.000]  one CNN report that said hey green sex life is good green dating is good only have one
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.480]  child I said I read four articles on air in that one day and my point was that one day
[27:39.480 --> 27:44.080]  without looking four articles in mainstream news saying how good it is to have only one
[27:44.080 --> 27:49.520]  child for your carbon footprint I mean a guy just took hostages two days ago saying this
[27:49.520 --> 27:54.520]  it's it's all over the news it you wallow in it I don't take time magazine and Newsweek
[27:54.520 --> 27:58.360]  my mother still does I go to their house for dinner at least once a week with my children
[27:58.360 --> 28:02.600]  and and they're laying around it it's the end of summer that you know kids should stay
[28:02.600 --> 28:08.520]  in school you should only have one child suicide is good for the earth I mean it's it's everywhere
[28:08.520 --> 28:12.160]  I'm not even looking for this and I'm in the checkout line at the grocery store and see
[28:12.160 --> 28:17.000]  it everywhere routinely by the magazine and show it to you and I was giving him piles
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.800]  of this and what did Dan Harris do he says Alex I I've got to CNN report it was just
[28:22.800 --> 28:31.920]  joking about having one child and I said no and and then he just cut he wouldn't show
[28:31.920 --> 28:38.080]  me saying no I showed you four articles today and my point is we're based it in this propaganda
[28:38.080 --> 28:44.960]  this anti-human propaganda this overpopulation propaganda and his message is Alex exaggerated
[28:44.960 --> 28:48.360]  by taking out of context what I did but he went further we're gonna play the clip when
[28:48.360 --> 28:53.880]  we come back and I'm gonna analyze it he went further than that I mean every millisecond
[28:53.880 --> 28:58.280]  everything they do is a distortion he said I won't even give you that a world government's
[28:58.280 --> 29:04.320]  forming as if he gives it to me as if he's up on the mountain and I receive it like he's
[29:04.320 --> 29:12.680]  Moses with the tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments the the Leviticus law he is my
[29:12.680 --> 29:21.920]  my priest you know ABC if they say it isn't real it isn't when Dan Harris the anchor of
[29:21.920 --> 29:30.680]  Nightline the anchor of ABC Nightly News when I showed him the establishment themselves
[29:30.680 --> 29:36.680]  in triplicate calling for world government and showed him videos of it he just said no
[29:36.680 --> 29:40.120]  there is no world government being formed even though the IMF came out last week with
[29:40.120 --> 29:43.840]  another report calling for world government and a new global currency called the band
[29:43.840 --> 29:51.080]  core so he's hoping his audience is ignorant and in trying to dumb him down we're on the

[33:16.120 --> 33:20.840]  through the 20th century and now in the 21st century it's time to stand up and realize

[33:25.440 --> 33:29.560]  dehumanization I don't know about you but I'm concerned with what's happening in this

[35:16.120 --> 35:38.200]  thank you for joining us today all belties coming up in the next hour to discuss the
[35:38.200 --> 35:42.680]  vicious attacks on the second amendment I've got world news health news climate and energy
[35:42.680 --> 35:50.760]  Israel Iran Middle East news war on terror news but right now college is in we are breaking
[35:50.760 --> 35:56.980]  down the anatomy of a high-tech brainwashing disinformation nightline piece seven million
[35:56.980 --> 36:03.120]  people conservatively watch this as their lead story last night they did a few minutes
[36:03.120 --> 36:09.560]  on the hurricane and then cut straight to this and they went to Tony Blair and his admissions
[36:09.560 --> 36:16.640]  after that and I'm gonna go ahead and start playing this clip I'll be stopping it throughout
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.280]  I've already analyzed the basic disinformation tactics they used but then I'm gonna stop
[36:22.280 --> 36:27.280]  and again point each one out and people know this about mainstream corporate media they
[36:27.280 --> 36:33.200]  understand the agenda people instinctively have no how much they twist and spin and lie
[36:33.200 --> 36:36.960]  so 10 years ago when they could get away with this more people are just starting to really
[36:36.960 --> 36:44.160]  wake up and change their paradigm it would just be brazen total straw man and we still
[36:44.160 --> 36:49.960]  see some of those tactics two hours after poplowski kills three cops the guy hates me he's a white
[36:49.960 --> 36:53.720]  supremacist attacking me all over the web I didn't know who he was but later we found
[36:53.720 --> 36:58.680]  out and they lied and said Alex Jones you know made him do it and I forced five newspapers
[36:58.680 --> 37:04.240]  to retract okay I sent him letters and I said look here he is on his website and other white
[37:04.240 --> 37:08.880]  supremacists attacking me you know he didn't do this for me and you know that this was
[37:08.880 --> 37:14.560]  put out within two hours of them arresting him how dare you and they retracted so they
[37:14.560 --> 37:21.680]  they still do brazen straw man type stuff trying to sick the police and IRS on me the statesman
[37:21.680 --> 37:26.960]  New York Daily News implied that I supported stack attacking the flying his airplane in
[37:26.960 --> 37:31.520]  the building here in Austin I was on air within one hour and 10 minutes of that happening
[37:31.520 --> 37:36.760]  it happened at about 955 I was on air at 11 so about an hour and five minutes later and
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.440]  I said you watch they're gonna blame it on me this is horrible I'm against violence and
[37:41.440 --> 37:46.560]  an hour after that by the noon hour so two hours and five minutes later there were already
[37:46.560 --> 37:51.560]  blogs making fun of me look Alex is me is saying this about himself he's saying they're
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.320]  gonna blame him what a kook and within minutes of that there was already mainstream articles
[37:56.320 --> 38:04.440]  saying that I basically loved it and was encouraging it I know how they operate okay I know what
[38:04.440 --> 38:08.400]  they're up to all I do is study them you know what your favorite football team is gonna
[38:08.400 --> 38:13.040]  do you've been watching them for decades or you love a coach and you most the time can
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.360]  judge what play they're about to run you sit there in your house drinking beer eating pizza
[38:17.360 --> 38:23.720]  saying look Bob I told you I told you he was gonna run the split wedge shotgun or whatever
[38:23.720 --> 38:29.320]  it is it's the same thing all of you can figure this out if you just start studying how they
[38:29.320 --> 38:36.600]  operate so people know they spin and lie but now they're not as brazen they do it in a
[38:36.600 --> 38:40.640]  lot of different ways and so they just imply I'm sitting around going the government's
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.880]  poisoning the water the government's once world government you know Jones has no proof
[38:45.880 --> 38:54.200]  he's just saying this and very telling how ABC anchorman interviewing me said oh I'm
[38:54.200 --> 38:59.760]  not gonna even give you that a world government's being formed counting on his viewers hoping
[38:59.760 --> 39:03.720]  his viewers haven't read the thousands of mainstream articles admitting world governments
[39:03.720 --> 39:09.040]  here run by private international banks exactly as we said it would form and run by the exact
[39:09.040 --> 39:13.680]  people we said would form it because we were reading their own white papers and I've used
[39:13.680 --> 39:22.600]  this analogy many many times but it it'd be like if my wife liked a television show and
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.840]  she told me this show is coming on Monday night at eight and then the show came on I
[39:26.840 --> 39:30.840]  said my gosh honey you're a genius how did you know this was coming on eight o'clock
[39:30.840 --> 39:38.120]  because it's in the TV guide I mean that's what I mean the Rockefeller Foundation in
[39:38.120 --> 39:42.880]  68 said we'll develop vaccines sterilize people in 88 they said we've got a tetanus shot with
[39:42.880 --> 39:49.520]  a hormone added it'll sterilize women then by 1995 through a UN program Rockefeller funded
[39:49.520 --> 39:58.200]  they were caught doing it in three continents Asia Africa and South America I mean open and
[39:58.200 --> 40:05.360]  shut done caught red-handed red-handed and now because we're exposing them they're coming
[40:05.360 --> 40:08.800]  on going yeah we do want to sterilize you it's for the earth yeah we do want to add
[40:08.800 --> 40:12.640]  stuff to the water to make you calm and make you happy and make you be passive and go along
[40:12.640 --> 40:17.880]  with what we're saying so you're literally hooked into a brainwashing system when you
[40:17.880 --> 40:21.920]  just sit there drooling watching television and that's who they want they want their audience
[40:21.920 --> 40:26.880]  that just sits there on Prozac or sits there on drugs or whatever they're doing or drunk
[40:26.880 --> 40:32.080]  just accepting whatever ABC says they're hoping you're not conscious we're saying be conscious
[40:32.080 --> 40:37.320]  watch everything learn about these tactics what is my tactic as I say in the piece everybody's
[40:37.320 --> 40:41.240]  got an agenda I teach my son that mine is liberty freedom and the truth and I just
[40:41.240 --> 40:46.520]  frontal assault forget the maneuvers I go straight at them with the truth with historical
[40:46.520 --> 40:52.400]  societal information and then you make a decision about what you want to do okay I'm gonna stop
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.520]  and start this a few times but here is the nightline piece that seven million people
[40:56.520 --> 41:03.720]  watched last night here it is if you're to stand on a street corner hollering that the
[41:03.720 --> 41:08.200]  government is poisoning our water supply you'd probably get a little more than eye rolls
[41:08.200 --> 41:12.440]  and head shakes but do the same thing in a radio booth you might just get a million
[41:12.440 --> 41:17.380]  listeners a day such as the case for Alex Jones okay a man who trades in okay back up
[41:17.380 --> 41:25.400]  a few seconds so again if I say to you red bicycle what do you image in your mind a red
[41:25.400 --> 41:30.880]  bicycle if I say blue whale what do you image a blue whale if I say giraffe what do you
[41:30.880 --> 41:36.080]  image a giraffe if I say Bengal tiger what do you see a Bengal tiger in your mind's eye
[41:36.080 --> 41:44.680]  it images it if I say 747 what do you image a large passenger jet if I say Colorado what
[41:44.680 --> 41:50.960]  do you image mountains his image that he puts in your mind is of a person with a scraggly
[41:50.960 --> 41:58.160]  beard with mustard stains down their front screaming the end of the world is near drooling
[41:58.160 --> 42:01.640]  if you stand on the street corner yelling you know the government's poisoning the water
[42:01.640 --> 42:05.200]  you're a kook but if you're doing it you're Alex Jones see they don't like they're all
[42:05.200 --> 42:10.600]  about imaging they don't like it that I'm sitting here in a decent studio well-spoken
[42:10.600 --> 42:19.080]  talking to you see that has a higher level of gravitas and dignity than a homeless person
[42:19.080 --> 42:24.360]  and a lot of those homeless people are vets or they're people that have really lived and
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.840]  experienced trauma and they're freaked out by the incredible realities and it makes them
[42:28.840 --> 42:34.680]  go crazy many philosophers have said you'll get a lot better idea about the world sometimes
[42:34.680 --> 42:41.600]  from an old homeless man but see he's a slick guy in a fancy studio with a suit and that's
[42:41.600 --> 42:48.320]  their message we have more credibility than Alex Jones because they talk softly they're
[42:48.320 --> 42:54.680]  condescending they laugh at me here it is there's a day such as the case for Alex Jones
[42:54.680 --> 42:59.240]  a man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories you have to wonder if he really believes
[42:59.240 --> 43:06.680]  half of what he says Dan Harris boss is defined every five seconds another psych warfare operation
[43:06.680 --> 43:12.800]  now they're implying I don't have credibility am I you know I'm just making this stuff up
[43:12.800 --> 43:17.680]  you have to wonder see they don't put the issue on the table is a world government forming
[43:17.680 --> 43:23.400]  are they putting things in the water to make a servile and sterilizes you know is this
[43:23.400 --> 43:28.000]  phenol a in the printer ink in most the products to sterilize you I have the government documents
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.000]  talking about it of course it is five years ago they laugh at you and say this phenol
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.320]  a in the problem shut up cooks I had media attack me five years ago about this phenol
[43:37.320 --> 43:41.800]  a now they admit it and pulling it off the shelves hundred percent it does it thousands
[43:41.800 --> 43:50.520]  of studies they've known for six decades so see what he's doing see what he just did right
[43:50.520 --> 43:58.200]  there they make it about do you like how Alex looks does he even believe what he's saying
[43:58.200 --> 44:04.440]  it's about whether you believe in me because that's all they've got their slick they've
[44:04.440 --> 44:10.200]  got fancy studios they've got good-looking well-spoken people everyone chosen off of
[44:10.200 --> 44:18.680]  Q scores with focus groups on can they sell this to people see with them it's all packaging
[44:18.680 --> 44:22.240]  and so they want you to go off packaging not go out and find out of Alex is telling you
[44:22.240 --> 44:26.200]  the truth because when you do go research you'll find out not only am I telling you
[44:26.200 --> 44:32.200]  the truth it's far bigger than I can even describe the world's far too big and complex
[44:32.200 --> 44:36.760]  but in almost every case it bends towards even being darker than I can even imagine
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.280]  you can look at their white papers their documents but the reality of the tyranny is so much more
[44:41.280 --> 44:48.480]  real than just talking about it you know if I say car wreck dead bodies on the highway
[44:48.480 --> 44:52.040]  you can image that but isn't it even more real to drive down the road and see smashed
[44:52.040 --> 44:56.160]  bodies and guts smeared on the road you ever seen that I've seen that a few times I seen
[44:56.160 --> 45:04.240]  people decapitated on the side of the road but see I can tell you about that but until
[45:04.240 --> 45:10.720]  you've seen it until you pulled over to help people when a Corvette flips five or six times
[45:10.720 --> 45:16.120]  and there's people with their heads chopped off and blood squirting out oh yeah I pulled
[45:16.120 --> 45:21.600]  right off when there's when there's when there's blood spurting you say what are you talking
[45:21.600 --> 45:26.560]  about I'm explaining to you that they want you to only have the image do you believe
[45:26.560 --> 45:32.040]  ABC or do you believe Alex and I'm saying you can't believe Alex Jones or ABC you've
[45:32.040 --> 45:37.520]  got to go out and see the car wreck of tyranny of the new world order of lying about WMDs
[45:37.520 --> 45:42.160]  of lying about derivatives for yourself you've got experience losing your job you've got
[45:42.160 --> 45:46.480]  experience your 10 year old getting cancer from the vaccines you've got experience your
[45:46.480 --> 45:51.200]  18 month old going into a convulsion when they're given the MMR shot to really know
[45:51.200 --> 45:56.680]  that I'm not lying to you you've got to experience the CPS coming and taking your child I know
[45:56.680 --> 46:02.240]  them what did I say last week I said every time I see an abuse case almost every time
[46:02.240 --> 46:09.000]  and it's really horrible some crack head with a four year old child who weighed 15 pounds
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.920]  a six month old supposed to weigh 15 pounds there was a case in New York and it turned
[46:13.920 --> 46:24.720]  out the CPS had known for years and did nothing but if you're a healthy good looking family
[46:24.720 --> 46:31.360]  with a blonde hair blue eyed baby that they want they'll take your child for nothing but
[46:31.360 --> 46:35.480]  if you're some poor black baby that the system doesn't care about because this is a eugenics
[46:35.480 --> 46:41.760]  operation they let her starve her little four year old daughter to death she was found in
[46:41.760 --> 46:49.440]  a crap filled bed chained down 15 pounds looking worse than a concentration camp victim what
[46:49.440 --> 46:53.760]  did I say last week I said I've seen these cases over and over again the really horrible
[46:53.760 --> 46:58.920]  you'll hear CPS needs more funding in Texas or Florida or New York or Michigan because
[46:58.920 --> 47:03.080]  oh they let this family do this to their kid turns out they were having visits every week
[47:03.080 --> 47:09.440]  to the house and wouldn't take the child from this crack head that wouldn't feed her baby
[47:09.440 --> 47:15.000]  but your child falls out of a tree and breaks their arm and is four years old or five years
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.160]  old or six years old or climbs upon a picnic table and falls off they're going to take
[47:19.160 --> 47:22.880]  your child because they got families that want that little child and those families
[47:22.880 --> 47:28.080]  are given a back story they don't know the child was stolen by CPS all right I'm already
[47:28.080 --> 47:32.440]  digressing that's my point is this all just feeds out into thousands of other issues and
[47:32.440 --> 47:40.240]  topics and points are continue with the piece here it is now are you for Hitler or against
[47:40.240 --> 47:46.600]  Hitler whatever they say it's the opposite they tell what I mean again well I mean every
[47:46.600 --> 47:54.040]  second what does that mean I said this global government has many of the same policies and
[47:54.040 --> 47:59.080]  eugenics ideas of Hitler and so you're either for Hitler or you're against Hitler you're
[47:59.080 --> 48:03.840]  either for this new world order or you're against it this new world order is Hitlerian what
[48:03.840 --> 48:09.040]  do they do they just have me up there saying you're either for Hitler or against it to
[48:09.040 --> 48:16.160]  send a message that was that guy just saying he might be for Hitler they took a three second
[48:16.160 --> 48:19.800]  clip back it up back up to the start I'm not going to interrupt it anymore till we got
[48:19.800 --> 48:25.240]  a break and we'll come back for the rest please now I've I've just played 20 seconds of this
[48:25.240 --> 48:31.400]  and I had to stop it four times because everything is to confuse people and make them hate me
[48:31.400 --> 48:35.360]  and to go what is this lunatic talking about you're either for Hitler or against it no
[48:35.360 --> 48:43.120]  context I gave context they were here all day and they took six seven months to come
[48:43.120 --> 48:52.800]  up with a six and a half minute piece of total confusion here it is if you're to stand on
[48:52.800 --> 48:56.920]  a street corner hollering that the government is poisoning our water supply you'd probably
[48:56.920 --> 49:02.040]  get a little more than eye rolls and head shakes but do the same thing in a radio booth you
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.880]  might just get a million listeners a day such as the case for Alex Jones a man who trades
[49:06.880 --> 49:11.200]  in such sinister conspiracy theories you have to wonder if he really believes half of what
[49:11.200 --> 49:17.840]  he says Dan Harris went to Texas to find out are you for Hitler or against Hitler whatever
[49:17.840 --> 49:23.640]  they say it's the opposite they never tell the truth to Alex Jones the world is a very
[49:23.640 --> 49:28.960]  dark place America has been captured America is being robbed we are now being looted like
[49:28.960 --> 49:32.960]  a third world nation well I'm not going to sit down and shut up world government means
[49:32.960 --> 49:37.320]  world tyranny run by a scientific dictatorship of control freaks want to carry out forced
[49:37.320 --> 49:42.440]  population reduction do you actually believe everything you say I believe all of it absolutely
[49:42.440 --> 49:50.920]  I'm telling the truth none of it is you know a stick a show at all no it's all true Jones
[49:50.920 --> 49:56.280]  is arguably the nation's premier purveyor of what could be called paranoia porn the
[49:56.280 --> 50:01.760]  Obama deception the truth strikes back I'm live at 30 seconds all right is a six day
[50:01.760 --> 50:07.800]  a week radio show and webcast reach an estimated one million people a day this federal intrusion
[50:07.800 --> 50:13.880]  is out of control and on YouTube and elsewhere Jones estimates 200 million people have seen
[50:13.880 --> 50:24.680]  his various documentaries with titles like the fall of the republic endgame blueprint
[50:24.680 --> 50:30.760]  for global enslavement and the Obama deception you think Obama's a criminal Barack Obama
[50:30.760 --> 50:36.360]  is definitely an unconstitutional criminal Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories
[50:36.360 --> 50:40.840]  although he thinks that term belittles his reporting females running concentration all
[50:40.840 --> 50:47.160]  right yes we're gonna come back and play the rest of it and I've already made all my comments
[50:47.160 --> 50:54.080]  it's just everything in that piece is manipulation even the clips of my films they used were meant
[50:54.080 --> 51:02.160]  to be confusing like what is he doing we'll be right back attention this is a special
[51:02.160 --> 51:07.680]  alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS the IRS is now accepting
[51:07.680 --> 51:11.880]  reduced settlements from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed
[51:11.880 --> 51:16.520]  due to the financial crisis in America the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition
[51:16.520 --> 51:20.920]  of consumers financial troubles in today's economy if you owe $10,000 or more in back
[51:20.920 --> 51:25.320]  taxes to the IRS an open phone line has been established by American tax settlement for
[51:25.320 --> 51:32.560]  you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction by up to 75% number to call is 89026969 again
[51:32.560 --> 51:37.240]  the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response

[52:09.280 --> 52:14.120]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not
[52:14.120 --> 52:19.000]  mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[52:19.000 --> 52:24.400]  they think they own our water children our education our money we have to define who

[54:38.200 --> 54:42.160]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government
[54:42.160 --> 54:46.680]  think tanks propose is poisoning the water to dumb down the population make a more easily
[54:46.680 --> 54:53.480]  manageable 9 11 was an inside job yes 9 11 was an inside job it was a staged event to
[54:53.480 --> 54:58.320]  launch the iraq war to set up a domestic police state here in the united states in back up
[54:58.320 --> 55:03.400]  a few seconds police thank you so he just sits there they're poisoning the water they stage
[55:03.400 --> 55:09.040]  the terror attacks they've got camps like he's perry mason and I'm just admitting how crazy
[55:09.040 --> 55:16.520]  I am of course I gave him the emergency centers act bill which is legislation to openly fund
[55:16.520 --> 55:23.760]  what they've already built rex 84 I gave him everything and they admit brigade homelands
[55:23.760 --> 55:29.600]  training for civil unrest and mass arrest I mean that's army times he doesn't care it's
[55:29.600 --> 55:35.120]  just boy look at this crazy person let's continue was a staged event to launch the iraq war to
[55:35.120 --> 55:39.080]  set up a domestic police state here in the united states look in the mirror people who
[55:39.080 --> 55:44.720]  monitor hate groups say they are extremely worried about the influence jones had you
[55:44.720 --> 55:51.640]  know is that you have these vociferous critics who say that that by floating and pause back
[55:51.640 --> 55:57.840]  it up again a few seconds so people that monitor hate groups but the southern property law
[55:57.840 --> 56:03.080]  center in ADL have been so exposed as political hacks that demonize innocent people and that
[56:03.080 --> 56:07.640]  folks like halterner work for the feds that they wouldn't even say their names just people
[56:07.640 --> 56:14.000]  that monitor hate groups so the message is I'm a hate group and then they go into I'm
[56:14.000 --> 56:20.000]  going to cause violence like the guy watching all the inconvenient truth movies and things
[56:20.000 --> 56:27.640]  that took hostages a few days ago who's calling for global one child policies continue
[56:27.640 --> 56:33.480]  for his critics who say that that by floating these highly charged ideas at a time when
[56:33.480 --> 56:38.120]  the country is already very angry and anxious that you're making things more dangerous look
[56:38.120 --> 56:45.480]  I've got a report the information I see and what I believe is happening I have a responsibility
[56:45.480 --> 56:49.160]  to put out the information and what people do with it that's their issue let's stop there
[56:49.160 --> 56:53.800]  let's stop there in the text article they wrote for ABC you can go read it it says I've
[56:53.800 --> 56:58.000]  got a responsibility to put out period and everybody's in the comments going what is
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.160]  he a male hooker so they made me sound crazy in the text by cutting that out and putting
[57:04.160 --> 57:09.280]  a period when I said I have a responsibility to put out the information I have took it
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.040]  out of context in the text because they could lie in the text and the text the way they
[57:14.040 --> 57:17.600]  put it together is even worse than the actual piece it makes it sound like I'm this guy
[57:17.600 --> 57:21.200]  that's about to cause a revolution and notice it's not about the corrupt banks the corrupt
[57:21.200 --> 57:25.960]  government that's making people angry it's not their fault no it's my fault that I'm
[57:25.960 --> 57:30.600]  telling them what the government's doing to them see how every 10 seconds is another lie
[57:30.600 --> 57:35.800]  they hit you on every level to try to punch that button it's a full spectrum attack to
[57:35.800 --> 57:41.560]  try to hit everybody watching with whatever their hot button is hate groups you name it
[57:41.560 --> 57:46.760]  they're punching those buttons they make me sound incoherent I have a responsibility to
[57:46.760 --> 57:54.400]  put out information that I have they cut it it put out here dish ABC nightly news slash

[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:09.480]  their three young children so your son knows the word propaganda yes a seven-year-old I
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:15.040]  did pause that's what happened it's implied it's implied there that it's bad if you're
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:20.320]  seven-year-old knows the word propaganda wow remember when the CPS took Barry Cooper's
[1:01:20.320 --> 1:01:26.800]  son and they they put in the Williamson County ordered to take him the father had taught
[1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:33.880]  the what was it six seven-year-old not to trust the government so oh my gosh his son
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:39.560]  pretty soon is this this person's child knows how to talk this person's child knows who
[1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:46.560]  Thomas Jefferson is holy mackerel this is incredible and so the message is then I go
[1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:50.680]  on and say I teach my son to question everything and then everybody has an agenda so this is
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:55.520]  a whole Alex has an agenda as if having an agenda is bad no my agenda is out in the open
[1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:01.320]  I'm naked about what I do let's continue your Alex Jones son I mean the most important thing
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:07.080]  as he knows everybody has an agenda including myself all I'm calling for is a real investigation
[1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:10.600]  and the people of Oklahoma City have been calling for an investigation Jones who's thirty
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:15.880]  six got his start with a local cable access show in the nineteen ninety he now has a huge
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:21.680]  fan base which includes celebrities like Willie Nelson Jesse Ventura Charlie Sheen we want
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:26.640]  our country back Mr. President and calling each and every American citizen to wake up
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:32.280]  stand up and demand the truth and Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag Spencer Pratt good
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:38.120]  to have you on pause thank you we've had hundreds of celebrities on this broadcast they contacted
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:42.280]  me to say they've become Christian and love the Lord and wanted to expose the new world
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:46.600]  order they know that Spencer and Heidi are unpopular many people so it's another guilt
[1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:53.680]  by association let's continue so much I'm so honored to be honest you are a true legend
[1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:57.680]  a true American patriot do you think there's some percentage of the people who watch you
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:03.480]  do it for entertainment value a very low percentage but we have heard that before while he admits
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:07.480]  that some people may watch him purely for entertainment he says the real reason for
[1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:18.520]  his recent growth is that the public increasingly mistrust government however Jones sometimes
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:25.240]  seems to latch on to small pieces of information to prove his much larger more sinister theory
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:29.640]  we've been warning you we have a while we're here he says this about an article he found
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:35.980]  on CNN dot com and they recommend having a one child policy and I looked up the article
[1:03:35.980 --> 1:03:41.120]  and I have it and I can pull it up for you it's actually a fluffy feature piece interviewing
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:47.200]  a woman who wrote a semi-jokey book about having environmentally friendly sex in which
[1:03:47.200 --> 1:03:53.160]  he talks about doing dating and slipped in there it says we might want a one child policy
[1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:59.320]  order yeah but it was a sarcastic little aside not like the not cnn I'll see it's all sarcastic
[1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:05.800]  but see we've gone from there's no move for a world government it doesn't exist nuts talk
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:12.840]  about it too you can't prove the world government that's being formed as murderous I'm not even
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:16.440]  granting you that there's a world government being formed yeah that's why you're discredited
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:20.160]  you think it's not as you work yourself up into a lather on the show where you might
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:25.640]  sort of overstate your case slightly certainly I've overstated the case sometimes but more
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:32.640]  often than not in hindsight it comes out it's far worse than I'd even thought he says he
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:38.640]  actually hates his job and would love to come back and conclude this but I gave him four
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:44.000]  articles that day with the media promoting one child policy you see it everywhere if you
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:49.160]  can't miss it that was my point and he took one article before that day and implied it
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:05:01.000]  was a joke it wasn't a joke it wasn't a joke so see how they it's amazing hello friends

[1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:28.160]  end the piece with saying come on admit that you overstate things sometimes and I go well
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:32.120]  of course sometimes we say things are worse and later find out they weren't as bad as
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:36.640]  we thought but most of the time it's worse than we stated and that's the truth and we've
[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:40.760]  always you know pointed that out here and we're wrong about something we pointed out
[1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:44.080]  but we try to tell the truth we try to be accurate we have one of the best records of
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:48.480]  being accurate out there with the Trends and the societal movements and things that are
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:52.040]  going to happen just like I told you a year ago that they were saving the naked body
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:57.720]  scans that wasn't even my opinion I mean when when's government lying when their lips are
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:09:04.960]  moving 95% 99% depending on the I mean it's over 90% you've experienced that yourself
[1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:08.880]  but I didn't just go off that and say they're saving the images because I didn't trust
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:13.120]  them it was in and we posted the articles with the Homeland Security Directives going
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:20.000]  back two years ago so a year before I reported this it was available that they tune the naked
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  body scanners to be able to know that they can see your genitals that's how they know
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.160]  they've got the detail they want that's in the handbook and that they save them and now
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:36.280]  it's come out they lied and are saving them and they are having mobile vans and federal
[1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:40.080]  and state courthouses like we told you they would do I read think tanks three four years
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:44.600]  ago promoting how they were going to roll them out on the streets they've got these big mobile
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:49.680]  centers that they're going to put at the sports stadiums and for rock events and music events
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:54.400]  and operas that they're going to force you through we've shown the industry promo videos
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:59.960]  we've shown Homeland Security promoting taser bracelets and people are like my gosh two years
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:04.880]  after you reported on that the news was promoting taser bracelets how did you know because it
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:10.200]  was admitted the industries always tell you what they're going to do years before they
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:14.560]  go lobby the government to give them billions of dollars to buy this crud but I'm already
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:22.360]  digressing the point that I'm making here is that we were right about the naked body
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:27.160]  scanners we were right about all of this just like the media is hyping one child policy
[1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:32.360]  and how it's good for your carbon footprint and he's denying that that's even being promoted
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:37.640]  what I said on the air is they're promoting naked body scanners everywhere that's what
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:45.040]  I said on air I said on the show that they were promoting one child policies everywhere
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:50.560]  that's what I said on air I didn't say there was one article that proved that I said here's
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:55.200]  for today showing how they're promoting it but they took everything out of context to
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:59.000]  make it look like I was just making it up all right I got a guest coming up the moment
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:05.440]  on the naked body scanners and how to try to defeat them and the fraud of their making
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:10.480]  you submit to having your privacy violated but but but let's finish up with a nightline
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:14.560]  piece here it is the case sometimes but more often than not in hindsight it comes out and
[1:11:14.560 --> 1:11:21.560]  it's far worse than I'd even thought he says he actually hates his job and would love to
[1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:27.000]  stop his show if only the bankers would be put in jail the federal government made smaller
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:34.200]  and all corrupt wars ended but he says he doesn't see any of those things happening
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:40.760]  anytime soon we until then he says it is his duty to shake America out of its trance
[1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:47.520]  are good friends at nightline or nightline this is Dan Harris of Sanctis in Austin Texas
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:52.240]  okay they show me joking around I went on to say I know you're doing a hit piece I know
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:59.480]  you work for the globalist but they took that out of context so I look goofy and he said
[1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:05.640]  what do you want to go away and I said abolish the fellow reserve arrest the Goldman Sachs
[1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:10.440]  executives and others that created the fraud of derivatives he boils it down to arrest
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:19.120]  the bankers so that a bank manager at a local bank thinks I want to arrest them and then
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:27.360]  end corrupt wars so just pure deception pure propaganda what an education on so many levels
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:32.160]  now shifting gears for the balance of this segment I want you to go to rocky flats gear
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:39.440]  dot com because I really want this system that this fellow has invented and invested
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:46.640]  his own money in and and and and is selling to become popular I really want this to catch
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:53.240]  on because I want the naked body scanners removed they violate our privacy they're saving
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:58.360]  the images they bathe you in radiation the list goes on and on and they're getting a
[1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:03.680]  360 biometric scan but the humiliation they're now saying they're going to go from trying
[1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:08.800]  to force you through the scanners to making everyone do it and the al Paso Times reported
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:12.600]  we first got tips from listeners then a week later confirmed it was true he was in the
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:17.480]  al Paso Times everyone's being forced through the al Paso Airport everyone's being made
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:21.760]  including children just like at the Denver courthouse and others they're forcing children
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:30.120]  through and so if they do try to force you through it'll also make the perverts mad these
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:35.360]  underwear they have the image of a fig leaf or the image of hands covering up them for
[1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:40.600]  men women they have shirts that have an image of hands over the breast so they don't get
[1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:49.120]  to scan that joining us is Jeff buskie of rocky flats gear dot com to tell me about
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:54.040]  this product and how it works and exactly what's in it but I've seen the demonstrations
[1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:59.920]  of it really does work how does this stop the radiation from getting the image of your
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:07.360]  genitals sir oh good morning there Alex a good afternoon yeah the the I guess before
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:13.440]  we jumped in maybe our quick color works and my background is electrical engineering and
[1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:19.640]  I worked for a general electric medical systems years ago doing a digital x-ray system so
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:29.080]  I have a background with x-ray filters and x-ray image or x-ray generation equipment
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:36.080]  and I've been watching this flow creep with tyranny and the and the ratcheting up of the
[1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:47.920]  intrusiveness of the airport scanners and the oh so with that knowing about ionizing
[1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:56.240]  radiation and the hazard it represents to living organisms and and how ionizing radiation
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:04.200]  x-rays in particular are you know damaging to the DNA I thought that a product that would
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:11.560]  protect radio sensitive tissues of the breath and the testicles would be a a reasonable
[1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:18.560]  thing to do for just general you know public safety and then the intrusiveness of the scanner
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:24.720]  is a is an obvious issue and I've got all these top scientists even in the New York
[1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:29.760]  Times LA Times admitting that it's 20 to 50 times what they'd previously said and then
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:35.680]  it will definitely hurt things on the surface like genitals that are very susceptible to
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:41.920]  radiation and skin cancer that's admitted and and if this really catches on I bet homeland
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:45.940]  security will come out and try to say you can't do it and then it'll be wait I can't
[1:15:45.940 --> 1:15:51.040]  cover up my testicles I can't cover up my wife's breast I can't let you naked body
[1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:56.400]  scan my seven-year-old or eight-year-old daughter or son I mean this is really a genius idea
[1:15:56.400 --> 1:16:05.400]  you came up with well it's it's application of nanotechnology the material science into
[1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:14.440]  a comfortable package your product that people can quickly slip on we've made it lead free
[1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:20.720]  using more premium materials so that it has a similar yes I'm ignorant I apologize I just
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:24.560]  guess that it would have you know lead and pregnant it into it because I know a little
[1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:28.120]  bit about radiology and that's the classic thing so you've got something safe in there
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:36.320]  yeah well the idea is to use a high atomic weight element and lead and is one of those
[1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:45.240]  items that the inexpensive material that that is a shoe in for ready or normal in the x-ray
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:49.840]  shields as you obviously know and it's impregnated within the products and it's safe but yours
[1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:54.560]  doesn't even have that you have some other type of high atomic weight material yes and
[1:16:54.560 --> 1:17:00.800]  actually it's a it's a blend of low low medium and high and high atomic weight materials
[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:06.760]  and it forms what referred to as a gradient filter and by the way we've gotten this from
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:11.720]  my wife has to fly we've given it as birthday presents to friends I mean I really believe
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:17.200]  in this and unfortunately sir we crashed your site rocky flats gear.com so folks can't get
[1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:22.840]  to it today make sure you get your site back up yeah no I tried and more memory knowing
[1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:34.040]  that this might happen we do have an 800 number that it's the 1 800 or 888 x-ray not and then
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:40.480]  this will have the site back up and and like when 10,000 people jump on it it's not designed
[1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:46.600]  for industrial use but they can try it back on you know later in the day and you probably
[1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:50.720]  got a hundred thousand hitting it right now yeah it'll be about a million about a night
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:57.280]  so you better get some big servers fast yeah but yeah the the material is is designed to
[1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:08.560]  be easily worn it's lead free it also has anti-microbial materials added in the form
[1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:16.320]  of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to discourage my micro growth and by the way it's very
[1:18:16.320 --> 1:18:20.840]  comfortable you know I've tried these out before I promoted them I'm just glad you
[1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:24.560]  contacted us I mean what is it less than a millimeter thick but it's able to stop the
[1:18:24.560 --> 1:18:32.720]  radiation from getting a photo of your genitals correct and and the the new scanners now they're
[1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:39.240]  coming out with with photo recall type type scanners that are what do you call it the
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:45.200]  transmission x-ray and they're using those in an important Korea and I think they just
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:51.200]  installed one in a in the airport in northern you know I've got to have you back on for
[1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:55.800]  a full interview because I've been reading about how they said oh al-qaeda may have breast
[1:18:55.800 --> 1:19:01.960]  implant bombs we've got to hit you with chest x-rays I didn't know sir you just I'm gonna
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:06.440]  look this up I believe there I mean I believe you because I know they have 500 mobile trucks
[1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:10.760]  that shoot through your house that are much more powerful than chest x-rays that's an
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:14.600]  assault on you and your family you're telling me airports are putting in the super high
[1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:23.440]  powered babies yeah there's there's a there's a product called con pass the co-n-p-a-s-s
[1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:28.600]  and it was designed originally for prison use and it's in the that particular system
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:33.720]  I believe it's installed in the airport in Korea holy mackerel so these only work on
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:39.880]  the stuff in Europe in the u.s. that get the naked body scan well these are designed for
[1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:45.520]  abort the terror hurt the waves and the backscatter x-rays oh so this even works on the high powered
[1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:49.800]  babies right you know what I got Paul velty coming up I want to do a couple more minutes
[1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:54.280]  with you and give that number out it's rocky flats gear calm I'm sorry you can't go to

[1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:13.280]  for I've known you for like 15 plus years I knew you before I got on the radio because
[1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:18.800]  I'd go to gun rallies for peaceable Texas for firearms rights and for the Texas rival
[1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:24.400]  association and all those meetings and groups how long have you been doing that since 93
[1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:28.480]  yeah so I think I've known you since about 94 when I really got active so I've known
[1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:32.440]  you before I got on air but we're going to go to you in just a moment first get your
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:35.800]  take on the naked body scanners you said they're going in the federal courthouse here you're
[1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:39.360]  angry about that he's also a lawyer we're going to deal with a very serious second
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:44.720]  amendment issue here with a private seller being persecuted and convicted dealing with
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:49.280]  the Austin gun show and similar stings are going on nationwide he's got a key press release
[1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:53.520]  up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and also on the peaceable Texans for
[1:24:53.520 --> 1:25:00.200]  firearms rights website but finishing up with rocky flats gear dot com engineer radiologist
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:05.480]  expert who got angry about the naked body scanners he's come up with one that works on all the
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:11.520]  systems and doesn't have any lead in it it has other you know high atomic weight metals
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:16.000]  in it and it's very thin and it really works for men and women and they have shirts for
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.440]  women that don't want their breasts being scanned very very exciting since your site
[1:25:20.440 --> 1:25:26.200]  crash and I want people to not let the perverts at homeland security have their way give us
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:33.000]  that number again Jeff so that they can call and still get these great things that cover
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:44.680]  up their privacy sure yes 888 x ray not 888 x ray not what's the number prefix of that
[1:25:44.680 --> 1:25:54.800]  oh I thought you'd ask me a tough question like that 888 9 you're trying to calculate
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:26:00.720]  it let's just go yeah with the acronym give it to us again 888 x ray not okay 888 x ray
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:07.360]  not okay 888 x ray not well very exciting and I want will you send us an email because
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:10.960]  I know I can search engine it and find it but that's big news that they're putting the
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:15.120]  hardcore scanners in can you send us an email about that and perhaps I can have you back
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:21.400]  up soon to talk about it sure yeah we'll we'll we'll have some articles up on that and then
[1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:29.960]  when our server gets back up and going but it was a it was a airport in in northern England
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:37.200]  that there was installing the it's a transmission type so they put you on a little and you they
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:44.320]  slide you past the imaging device and it creates a a transmission x-ray so now I guess the
[1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:51.360]  security people are going to be radiologists so I guess maybe part of the new health care
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:58.160]  program can do math tuberculosis screening at the airport as they added bonus to these
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:02.560]  new high-powered machines well it's incredible and and and from what I've read they don't
[1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:08.960]  have the the security people standing behind a lead wall or wearing a lead apron so kind
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:12.960]  of like the government now says du's not bad for even though the army admits is deadly
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:16.960]  radiation and poison it's just like hey we're going to radiate everybody have you seen the
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:22.560]  Forbes report about the 500 mobile vans that blasts through your walls with radiation yeah
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:28.400]  no I had seen the company called the American Scientific and Engineering and it's basically
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:41.120]  a mobile gamma ray device that operates I think around 500 to 700,000 volt x-ray energy
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:47.240]  and it goes through sheet metal and the trunks of cars and and they use it for inspecting
[1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:52.200]  oh the the big shipping container and now they're saying they're driving by your house
[1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:57.080]  hitting you with this I mean I'm a layman but isn't this off the charts compared to even
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:05.160]  a chest x-ray yeah this is that ten times the energy and and the I guess the operative
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:10.520]  word is the insane okay so I'm a layman I'm just guessing that you know to shoot through
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:14.680]  your body up close to shoot through your house I was saying thousands but I'm wrong it's
[1:28:14.680 --> 1:28:19.400]  ten times but that is still incredible sir I look forward to speaking to you again and

[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:51.880]  but briefly what's your view on the naked body scanners well I think they're terrible I hate them
[1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:56.760]  I mean I I don't even think we should have the metal detectors in the courthouses I mean it always
[1:28:56.760 --> 1:29:00.920]  starts in the airports and then it's the federal courthouses first and then it's gone down they're
[1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:07.080]  putting them in the municipal court hit traffic court here in in Austin now it's utterly ridiculous
[1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:13.400]  I've talked to some some JPs you know well justice of the pieces and I'll hey you're going to get
[1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:19.400]  those uh those metal detectors put in oh yeah I would like to but they don't have the funding so

[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:28.200]  really like Perry but at least he said don't put metal detectors in the Capitol you know most of

[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:44.840]  headline press release at info wars dot com feds convict texan for selling a gun to illegal alien
[1:36:44.840 --> 1:36:49.080]  with the texas driver's license i followed this case that's happened they use this fake sting
[1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:57.080]  to shut down the gun show outside of law they the police just ordered them you the the owner
[1:36:57.800 --> 1:37:03.400]  of the property to not allow it anymore extra judicial outside of law we're going to get into
[1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:07.640]  this this is a big deal i'm going to give paul the floor here so he can get a word in edge wise
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:10.920]  and we're going to hold him till five minutes into the next hour and bob chatman joins us but
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:16.440]  i wanted him to finish up the naked body scanners going into the courthouses and other places
[1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:20.200]  and the point he was making during the break was i used to tell clients you know you have a
[1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:24.760]  fourth amendment will not any more so finish up with that then get into this incredible case
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:30.440]  because we're seeing this duplicated as a stage sting all over the country well i just wanted
[1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:37.320]  to point out that when i started practicing law there were no courthouse security metal detectors
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:43.000]  and uh you know i could go into any door the courthouse and so could any jurors could
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:49.160]  so all the witnesses uh but uh we've gotten so far away from that it's they're putting them
[1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:54.840]  in everywhere and and now they might can you take off your belt okay travels county courthouse
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:38:01.880]  and uh you know when you have to disrobe that's going too far truly well it's an act of submission
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:06.360]  it is it's an act of dog training that isn't i mean in nazi germany line up let us see your
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:11.320]  papers now it's line up we're in a naked body scan you and it got worse in nazi germany line up
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:16.760]  let us shoot you uh but it is conditioning they got the population used to it they think they
[1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:22.200]  need it and they don't i live that life i know we don't need that i know our generation is no more
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:27.080]  violent than the previous and i want the if we're not working but if a killer is going to go in
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:30.920]  they're going to go shoot through the guards i mean it's not going to stop anybody to put
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:34.840]  naked body scanners in shopping malls which they're now saying is next well you know and then they
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:39.800]  make exceptions for people okay i can go down and get a little card where i don't have to go through
[1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:46.360]  it and so can a lot of other people so uh how are they yeah it's a two-tier system we treat some
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:51.720]  people better like royalty than we do the common citizen okay they have to go through this the
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:57.160]  scanners whereas the judges and the prosecutors and the cops and and the defense attorneys and
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:39:02.760]  others with special privileges get to go go walk right past it and that is not right so it's
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:07.560]  discrimination everyone it's discrimination at all you need to do it to everyone because that's the
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:12.120]  only way you're going to ensure no one's really carrying because hell they could give
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:18.440]  they could give me one of their little passes and then i go nuts okay so i what good is the
[1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:25.480]  past to save or protect people in the courthouse if uh i decide i'm going to go in and shoot the
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:31.560]  place up after i get the little badge who watches the watchers no one's watching them i could tell
[1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:37.640]  you there's absolutely no one making sure a judge puts in an eight hour day uh there's no oversight
[1:39:37.640 --> 1:39:44.040]  over many government people um let's shift gears now unless you've got more to add on that no with
[1:39:44.040 --> 1:39:51.640]  what happened at the saxet gun show uh what six months ago or so what has unfolded since then
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:56.840]  and how they were able to extra judicially threaten the leaseholder into shutting this down and now
[1:39:56.840 --> 1:40:03.080]  they've sent a vietnam veteran a patriot a guy with you know an upstanding you know record
[1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:08.440]  to prison he's going to prison for six months in a federal work camp uh let's go through this all
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:14.280]  right well i think the important thing is that people need to get the word out that uh this could
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:21.800]  happen to them okay this could happen to any of us uh what happened was this gentleman is vietnam
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:29.880]  veteran uh sold a gun to an individual who had a texas driver's license who negotiated the sale of
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:37.240]  this firearm and uh then it turns out well he's an illegal alien and he passes the gun off to his
[1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:44.920]  friend who's also an illegal alien well uh how are you supposed to know how is a citizen supposed
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:52.280]  to know that the person standing in front of them is an illegal alien and the answer is there is no
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:59.000]  way to know the peace officer at the front door of the gun show is not even allowed to ask and
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:04.440]  that's what the lawsuit in arizona is about they don't want peace officers asking people they pull
[1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:10.200]  over on traffic stops if they're in the country illegally yet the citizen selling a gun from
[1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:15.560]  his private collection is some supposed to just somehow know there's also a lot of public ignorance
[1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:21.080]  you might cover that the media calls it the gun show loophole no it's a grandpa can give his
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:28.520]  14 year old a 22 you can sell your uh neighbor a 700 magnum it's called the private transfer
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:33.960]  okay in the 68 gun control act which by the way was based on hitler's statute on guns
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:40.440]  um so it's it's a sad comment on american law but it's on the late senator dot admitted that
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:46.520]  he'd been in the nuremberg trial well he we know he checked out the hitler's laws from the library
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:51.560]  of congress and had him translated a while and then shortly thereafter introduced the 68 gun control
[1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:55.400]  now my memory says though he was involved in the nuremberg correct he was a prosecutor there as
[1:41:55.400 --> 1:42:03.320]  okay okay but long anyway back to this case this is a travesty of justice uh what they did was
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:11.160]  they prosecuted this man for knowingly selling to an illegal alien but at the trial they admitted
[1:42:11.160 --> 1:42:18.440]  oh well yeah he really didn't know but he should have known and the law is is that the actual
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:23.800]  wording of the statute says is that you shall not sell a firearm to someone you had reasonable
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:29.560]  cause to believe was in the country illegally and that's what they argued to this jury they said well
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:34.520]  he should have known that this was an illegal alien because why well because of the way they
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:42.200]  walked and talked because they were they looked like mexicans they were hispanic they spoke spanish
[1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:50.280]  and english too by the way and they wore cowboy clothing that's what they did to that's what they
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:56.440]  talked this jury into this jury which boggles my mind now they wore cowboy clothing because that's
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:01.480]  where the cowboys came from mexicans are the real cowboys that's where the whole style came from
[1:43:01.480 --> 1:43:08.600]  but but i mean that's amazing that in uh arizona the feds are filing two lawsuits they've gone to
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:13.560]  the un they're saying a police pullover drunk driver and they're wearing a cowboy outfit they don't
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:18.360]  speak english they don't have an id you take them to jail but now they're saying oh as a citizen
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.960]  even if somebody's got an id is posing as a citizen we're going to send you to prison
[1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:30.920]  uh if you sell them a gun yes that's what they did to this van now there's no good reason to do this
[1:43:30.920 --> 1:43:39.240]  other than to scare us citizens into not selling our firearms not going to gun shows as i see it
[1:43:39.240 --> 1:43:43.480]  that's what it's really about because it's the government that caused this problem because they've
[1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:49.000]  allowed millions of people to enter the country illegally and then they have a law in the book
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:54.520]  that says you can't sell to these people and they give you no method to determine who's who and they
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:59.640]  give them a driver's license and they give them a driver's license yes now what's really gonna
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:07.720]  infuriate you is the individually sold the gun to with the driver's license nothing happened to him
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:15.080]  he is we just checked yesterday he's still living in austin apparently still has his job
[1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:22.280]  still has his texas driver's license he committed three distinct federal crimes he purchased the gun
[1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:28.440]  knowing he was an illegal alien he possessed the gun knowing he was an illegal alien and
[1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:33.800]  then he transferred the gun to another illegal alien okay and he's not been prosecuted for
[1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:38.280]  any so now we have selective enforcement more discrimination yeah but here's a 64 million
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:44.360]  dollar question the intel i got from the victim and for people the show is that they were running
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:50.520]  stings and it has appeared to be a staged event that was under surveillance do we know for a factor
[1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:54.920]  do we have any evidence that i mean we know they've let him go haven't prosecuted the illegal alien
[1:44:54.920 --> 1:45:02.120]  we know he's above the law now that this was a setup i don't know of any other rational conclusion
[1:45:02.120 --> 1:45:07.400]  you could make based on what we do know now i have no direct evidence that they're working with the
[1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:14.120]  guy but i will tell you it's common they don't lock up the narc they let the narc somehow gets
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:18.840]  out of jail the next day isn't that well we know this is part of a larger federal strategy and the
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:23.320]  Austin police department admitted this to the news the statesman and others that the feds are coming
[1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:28.760]  in pressuring them to quote shut down gun shows outside of the law and they're also at the justice
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:37.400]  department level using the the collapse of mexico and the drug war down there to claim that guns from
[1:45:37.400 --> 1:45:43.560]  texas arizona california new mexico are causing as this is part of a larger strategic operation
[1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:48.280]  though the actual study show close to 90 percent are being bought by the gangs directly from the
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:52.440]  military and most of them aren't us they're german that's where the mexicans buy most their
[1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:57.480]  helicopters and guns and machine guns and vehicles so that's not even true either now there are some
[1:45:57.480 --> 1:46:01.880]  mexicans that come by guns because they've been debarred the right to self-defense to protect
[1:46:01.880 --> 1:46:06.520]  themselves in mexico and quite frankly i'm all for the mexican people having guns yes it's it's
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:12.680]  amazing if you've ever been down to el paso you can see across the border from downtown el paso
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:18.280]  and you can see this imaginary political boundary on one side there's this prosperity huge buildings
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:26.920]  clean beautiful city on the other side is this dump and it's all because of your political structure
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:33.880]  it's an imaginary line yet it's it's stark contrast from one side to the other and on one side
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:38.840]  citizens are allowed to own guns and there's peace and tranquility on the other side they're not and
[1:46:38.840 --> 1:46:45.400]  there's mayhem and murder it's right it's literal road warrior it is it is out of control you go on
[1:46:45.400 --> 1:46:49.640]  the internet and pull up any of those that's not even the word i was looking at news yesterday
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:53.400]  of they go into nightclubs and cut everybody's heads off and it was all these men with their
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:58.440]  heads cut off in the nightclub and they and they take children and murder them they grab the latin
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:02.840]  american immigrants coming in the mexicans do and they kill them and when good police try to
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:07.480]  investigate the police come and kill them they're killing mayors almost every day there's rocket
[1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:13.480]  attacks now it's 28 000 deaths in the last couple of years i mean it is literally the most dangerous
[1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:18.120]  country in the world and they're blaming our second amendment for it yes it's amazing that
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:23.320]  they even try to do that it's such a stupid argument now tell us about the victim i've met him
[1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:28.120]  he's going to prison he's tried to contact us and and matt meant tried to get me to get him on i do
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:32.120]  want to get him on i apologize i've been so busy i wanted to research it further but you've now
[1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:35.480]  researched it even further but let's talk about the victim and what he's facing is there any way
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:41.640]  to help him is there an appeals process well yes he's going to appeal uh i don't put a lot of faith
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:46.680]  in appeals uh for certain various legal reasons tell folks the name of the victim then we'll get
[1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:55.080]  into that well his name is paul copeland uh he he goes by the nickname cb 56 year old vietnam fat um
[1:47:56.520 --> 1:48:02.920]  he's just he's you know lost his job over this he's um by the way he's a he's a mason he wears a
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:09.720]  mason necklace but the masons aren't helping him i know like zero about masons so yeah no i'm just
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:15.720]  pointing that out but uh yeah he would lose his home if his son wasn't uh willing to move in and
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:23.320]  take over the mortgage payments while he's in the joint uh so it's a sad deal but really what what i
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:30.440]  want people to understand is this could happen to them and my advice to everyone is as professional
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:38.680]  lawyer advice okay is based on this case and this prosecution you don't sell your guns to anyone that
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:45.320]  you're not absolutely sure is an american citizen yeah this means gun shops if a spanish person comes
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:50.840]  in with with with a suntan and dark hair and has a texas driver's license and fills it out you just
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:55.000]  can't sell to him i mean that and i don't want to discriminate against Hispanics but this is what
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:00.200]  they're doing well that's certainly the import i mean that's what they argued to this jury and
[1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:07.080]  this jury gave their stamp of approval uh you know and why is this guy still walking around
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:12.440]  it's a very dangerous precedent why is this illegal alien leon his name is leonel herwerte
[1:49:12.440 --> 1:49:22.120]  senior he's still living in austin he's not been deported he is he got on the witness stand okay
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:29.720]  under oath and admitted in front of a federal judge federal prosecutors and various other federal
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:36.040]  agents in the courtroom and admitted he was in the country illegally and allowed to walk out of
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:42.680]  the courtroom under his own power okay meanwhile the vietnam veterans in prison are about to go to
[1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:49.640]  prison about to go to prison yes now i ask you who's in a better position in any buy sell transaction
[1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:56.920]  to know if the buyer is an illegal person well that'd be that'd be the illegal the buyer right
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:50:03.640]  right okay so they they prosecute the seller though the citizen they don't prosecute the person
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:08.280]  knowingly lying but another question is how did he get the driver's license because they give him
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:13.480]  to anybody i don't know how he got it i'd like to know but there won't be an investigation about
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:21.960]  that yeah i'm sure that i'm sure we'll have these answers provided to us right uh no i'm joking um
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:28.600]  um uh what really bothers me is that it appears that this is an effort by the government atf
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:37.480]  apd create a chilling effect yes to to uh they're using illegal aliens to attack our rights we have
[1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:42.520]  a right to buy and sell firearms amongst each other it's called the private transfer we're not
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:49.400]  dealers you own guns you can decide hey velty you want to buy my gun and i can okay because we're
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:53.720]  private stay there this is key we gotta go to break folks they're using illegals to go after the
[1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:58.520]  assault weapons nationally and they're going after your local right to give your grandson a firearm

[1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:18.680]  this segment the next and we're going to bob Chapman uh recap all those great points and any
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:22.360]  other points you haven't gotten to and how we can somehow help this guy you also during the break
[1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:27.240]  said it'd be good if one of the jurors contacted you for even more on what went on behind the scenes
[1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:31.640]  yeah i would very much like to talk to those jurors to find out what went through their heads
[1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:39.880]  what were they thinking when they did this to a fellow citizen uh truly uh how do they expect
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:47.240]  us to know uh to protect ourselves from these illegal aliens uh it's you know we've what the
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:51.800]  estimates are twenty twenty five million people have entered the country more than that yeah what
[1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:59.000]  decade or so it's apps it's like an invasion uh it's treasonous in my opinion because because
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:04.520]  look what's the difference between helping uh thousand men with guns come across the border
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:11.720]  and take over the government what's the difference between that and assisting uh million people to
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:17.720]  come in set up shop and start voting and accomplish the same and then using them as informants to
[1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:25.880]  set up veterans well to to to put you out of work to put you in prison to make you give up your rights
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:34.120]  to use them to prosecute you as was done to paul copeland uh i think it's a crime it's a crime
[1:55:34.120 --> 1:55:39.560]  what the government's doing they're they're the ones in charge of immigration yet they're using
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:46.520]  these illegals they have allowed in the country against the citizenry in this case to to lock up
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:51.880]  a man and to frighten the rest of us into not exercising our lawful rights to buy and sell our
[1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:57.000]  guns that's what it's really it seems and you've really cut to the bone i mean your analysis is
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:03.080]  exactly my analysis because it's it's veritas it's the truth and it's it's outrageous and it's only
[1:56:03.080 --> 1:56:07.400]  going to get worse and they successfully shut down that gun show yes they did they use that
[1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:13.880]  sting on the news apd used that uh it wasn't you know what's interesting is that uh that was there
[1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:19.480]  was no arrest that day on january 16th of this year at the gun show paul copeland was not arrested
[1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:28.200]  he was let go they just took his gun collection swiped it you know robbed him and and left uh
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:38.680]  uh and yet the apd claimed because of the arrest at the gun show we're gonna have to shut it down
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.400]  because it's a nuisance they use this nuisance statute we have on the books here for crack houses
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:48.920]  for crack houses exactly whore houses place like that where this uh continues places of ill repute
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:54.280]  continued crime crime areas yeah uh if you have repeated arrests for drug possession and such it
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:59.800]  will certain locale they can come in and condemn your property as a nuisance right and make you
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:05.960]  pay damages and what clean it up and whatever well that's what apd was claiming at the gun show so
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:11.480]  it's just lawless out of control color of law what's yeah it was no there wasn't even color of
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:16.520]  law if you read the nuisance statute it clearly didn't apply to this kind of situation it limits
[1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:21.400]  itself to certain types of arrests so the government's out of control where do we go from here because
[1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:26.920]  i've seen this similar tactic being used all over the country illinois indiana california new
[1:57:26.920 --> 1:57:34.920]  mexico they're doing these things everywhere yes it's a to me it's a clearly uh a move by this
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:40.360]  administration that's an anti-gun administration they'll use whatever they can under the radar to
[1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:48.360]  attack us okay our gun rights um i think any kind of overt move like clinton did they have learned
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:53.000]  the hard way that's a bad political move so they're going to do things under the radar like
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:58:00.040]  destroy millions of perfectly good firearms that should be sold to the public the um you know the
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:06.680]  civilian the civilian marksmanship actually has a program where you can get a free m1 and now the
[1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:12.200]  feds are blocking that pro-second amendment good government policy of stuff that taxpayers already
[1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:16.520]  paid for instead of destroying it uh they would the citizens could get it or pay a small price or
[1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:21.240]  even get it free pay for the shipping not anymore they're destroying them and they're trying to
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:28.440]  block the military selling brass to uh yes three loaders that all of that's total insanity i mean
[1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:33.480]  we paid for this oh wait it's total insanity unless you're like hitler who didn't want the
[1:58:33.480 --> 1:58:38.760]  citizens armed then it makes perfect sense back in 70 seconds final five minutes with ball velty i'm
[1:58:38.760 --> 1:58:51.880]  alex jones this is gcn the genesis communications radio network this is alex jones with five good
[1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:57.080]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:58:57.080 --> 1:59:02.440]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[1:59:02.440 --> 1:59:07.720]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[1:59:07.720 --> 1:59:13.160]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power
[1:59:13.160 --> 1:59:18.840]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem

[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:33.960]  chavin joins us he's just tuned in the headline at info wars dot com feds convict texas for selling
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:39.080]  a gun to illegal alien with texas driver's license that's the press release we've got links to peaceable
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:43.480]  texas for firearms rights i appreciate paul veltey joining us paul give out the website
[2:00:43.480 --> 2:00:47.400]  again this is a national issue the obama administration using illegal aliens who are
[2:00:47.400 --> 2:00:52.040]  given driver's license to go set up citizens who legally transfer firearms to them they're also
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:56.360]  trying it with gun shops they come in and fill out fake forms government says they don't care
[2:00:56.360 --> 2:01:01.880]  they're sending you to jail they want to buy hooker by crook extra judicially outside the law
[2:01:01.880 --> 2:01:09.240]  or by using fake laws with juries or miss miss applying laws to send people to prison yeah well
[2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:15.960]  i call it uh creating legal risk if they make something like gun ownership so legally risky
[2:01:15.960 --> 2:01:23.640]  and costly that people just voluntarily give it up and quit exercising those rights that has
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:29.160]  accomplished their end and i think that's what we've been doing for the last well since the 68
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:35.000]  gun control act really because that's where it all started um the 68 gun control act a lot of
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:40.360]  people need to be aware you know they has a list of prohibited persons in it and that list has been
[2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:45.000]  growing and growing they keep adding in onto it see now they say if you're even in a divorce they
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:50.200]  file things and try to take your guns uh they're now trying to say veterans can't have guns if they
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:55.640]  ever collapse on the battlefield they're now saying that's a mental illness right um a lot of those
[2:01:55.640 --> 2:02:00.680]  provisions 68 gun control act were never enforced like for example it's illegal for a person who's
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:09.160]  addicted to drugs to or who's an illegal user of narcotics to a possessed farm and you could never
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:15.400]  prove that and so now rush limbaugh hurts his back uh he's on oxy cotton he can't own a gun
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:19.800]  it's more like the pot smoker you know if you're gonna be a pot smoker you can't be a gun owner
[2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:25.080]  because it's listed as a narcotic yes right even though it's not yeah that's listed as such yes
[2:02:25.080 --> 2:02:30.440]  what is that schedule three schedule one schedule one yes schedule one drugs have no known medical
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:35.880]  use whatsoever can't even experiment with them cocaine's on schedule two okay you can at least
[2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:42.040]  so marijuana is worse than cocaine yeah because cocaine has medical use in surgery uh yeah well
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:48.280]  one vessel but but the the history of marijuana is that it's been used medicinally for hundreds
[2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:52.360]  maybe a thousand years so they're widening i mean i can't tell you how many vets i know
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:58.040]  including one of them is a famous uh football player i'll just leave it at that and he has no
[2:02:58.040 --> 2:03:02.680]  criminal record and he tried to go in and buy a firearm last year and they said uh there's
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:06.200]  something in your army record and they wouldn't even tell them they said no more guns in fact we
[2:03:06.200 --> 2:03:10.520]  may come to your house and take them in fact you just can't buy a gun pal we're coming to take them
[2:03:10.520 --> 2:03:19.880]  yeah i uh have a vet who um has the same problem uh he's seeing the va doctors right a nice government
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:25.160]  paid for doctors but most of them are like indian and you know non-americans and he
[2:03:25.160 --> 2:03:31.640]  happened to draw a particular indian woman doctor who uh said oh you've got mental error you've got
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:36.520]  post traumatic stress disorder you shouldn't be allowed to have firearms anymore yeah i know it's
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:42.760]  foreigners who hate the second amendment because of the culture yeah uh it's it's it's a sad point
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:49.160]  we've come to but i'm glad you allow me to be here to at least wake up people a little bit as to this
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:55.400]  particular new threat uh with this prosecution of citizens for selling to illegal aliens we've
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:03:59.720]  got to get your press release out to everybody it's feds convict texans for selling a gun to

[2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:21.160]  there's a lot any of us can do for him now he's he's done been convicted all right uh there's
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:26.280]  one thing about the legal system is that it presumes itself to be so infallible that once
[2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:32.360]  they decide something it's decided it's arrest judicata and it stays that way and it's only
[2:04:32.360 --> 2:04:39.240]  prayer is an appeal and and that uh the judge made some kind of error during the course of his trial
[2:04:39.240 --> 2:04:45.320]  they could get a reversal well uh he uh contacted us after he'd been convicted i i'd met him before
[2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:49.480]  that after it had happened but we need to try to help him somehow paul velty thank you so much

[2:08:17.880 --> 2:08:23.640]  we are go we're gonna open the phones up on the attack on the second amendment the attack on
[2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:29.640]  arizona what's happening with the economy the nightline hit piece on my shelf that many of you
[2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:35.560]  saw last night or that i analyzed in the first hour bob Chapman joins us every friday in the third
[2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:39.960]  hour from the international forecaster dot com again i'm alex jones with info wars dot com
[2:08:40.680 --> 2:08:44.600]  and prison planet dot com and i haven't even really gotten into all the news yet
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:50.200]  there is just masses of it uh out there that we're going to be breaking down with bob Chapman but
[2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:56.120]  bob i know you were on hold for a little bit of that uh tail into that interview dealing with
[2:08:56.120 --> 2:09:02.600]  obama on records sending the justice department in with illegal aliens who are given driver's license
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:07.880]  and go into gun shops fill out fake forms and then they bust the gun shop when they didn't know
[2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:12.680]  or they're going into gun shows where legal private sellers can't be gun dealers
[2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:16.280]  but can sell their private collections by selling trade they're busting them
[2:09:18.040 --> 2:09:22.120]  for really non issues and we were just covering that i mean this is so
[2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:29.160]  incredibly corrupt well it's the kind of thing that you would expect from these people
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:34.200]  and uh it's probably going to continue until we can find a way to stop them from doing it
[2:09:34.200 --> 2:09:41.880]  and quite frankly i don't know that way uh i'm not an attorney and uh i i i just don't have an
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:47.160]  answer for it but you know it was a long time coming they're going to do everything possible
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:56.200]  uh to do what they can do uh to try to as a gentleman said intimidate people into not having
[2:09:56.200 --> 2:10:04.520]  weapons and you could get back to the 68 1968 legislation which he said a lot of wasn't implemented
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:11.880]  which is true and you know i was big in guns in those days and uh so i know you know lots about
[2:10:11.880 --> 2:10:18.760]  it and a lot of people rushed to buy all kinds of different things before uh they had the law
[2:10:18.760 --> 2:10:25.320]  so they wouldn't have to sign for anything etc but um it's going to be relentless and
[2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:31.720]  and as long as americans have weapons that they cannot implement what they want uh on the people
[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:39.000]  of the united states you know as you said in reference to the foreign doctor a foreign
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:46.280]  as they used to not having weapons and um and so their mindset is totally different and well
[2:10:46.280 --> 2:10:52.600]  yeah i mean a lot of their religions and by religion i mean their their their their culture
[2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:58.840]  and it's in areas of europe it's in asia it's everywhere is bootlicking the religion is bootlicking
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:06.200]  and and and and being upset by slave zoning guns and in slave cultures in dominated oppressed
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:12.440]  cultures the commoners aren't allowed to have weapons it's that simple that's right uh whether
[2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:21.640]  it's pikes or swords or crossbows or machine guns and uh and this is that mindset and that mindset
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:28.360]  allows the alumnus of the world to control people and it's a very good point because you know if
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:32.680]  they don't have any weapons they can howl all they want and we can shoot a few of them and they'll
[2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:38.520]  shut up absolutely concept but the truth is with a highly motivated population if it ever goes to
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:47.560]  that which i pray it doesn't you can get all the guns you want with a knife yes so so there is
[2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:52.440]  there is total resistance nothing can stop you if you're motivated go ahead that's right you're
[2:11:52.440 --> 2:11:59.000]  absolutely correct and i i think uh and i don't think people realize this uh i believe that the
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:05.880]  military is going to be a big plus for the american people i don't think they're gonna blindly fall
[2:12:05.880 --> 2:12:10.040]  by the way you're always saying that and i more and more agree with you bob i mean this isn't
[2:12:10.040 --> 2:12:16.840]  bragging it actually kind of freaks me out but but everywhere i go military stopped me everywhere i
[2:12:16.840 --> 2:12:23.400]  go police will pull up or come out of a coffee shop everywhere in other cities now and they are
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:28.680]  listening and they know it's true because they're living it they're experiencing it and they are
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:37.720]  really waking up right now well i'll tell you um i got a little story to tell you um i do a program
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:43.720]  i have for about all six years or so uh and it's called a marine disposition every thursday
[2:12:43.720 --> 2:12:51.640]  and it goes out to military people retired and active all over the world and particularly people
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:59.240]  and the marines and and the navy although many others listen including people in washington uh
[2:12:59.240 --> 2:13:06.680]  and uh and the state department etc and anyway um i had received a letter from a subscriber in
[2:13:06.680 --> 2:13:14.760]  greece uh who said his brother attended a wedding and on one of the islands and the wedding was
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:22.040]  attended by some wealthy industrialists of one form or another very successful people who are
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:33.800]  probably very well thought of in in greece and uh he told uh he was told that on september the 20th
[2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:41.560]  before the end of the month they expected a change in the greek government and i mentioned it on that
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:50.040]  marine program and i know soon it got out of my mouth when an email came in from one of the people
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:57.560]  who is a guard in athens at the embassy and he says you're absolutely right he says we're on
[2:13:57.560 --> 2:14:03.880]  pins and needles we've been put on alert they expect a coup and we hope it's bloodless
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:11.480]  and what do you think of that well you've got a lot of good sources and we'll find out
[2:14:12.040 --> 2:14:17.160]  uh so you're saying the word is now is this going to be a change of government against the bankers
[2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:25.080]  right in greece or is it going to be worse uh number one it's against the bankers uh and and
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:31.000]  it's against pop and reo who is an alumus to bill de berger and they want him out of there and uh
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:35.400]  they know what he is yeah the greece have been taken over by the nazis and many others
[2:14:35.400 --> 2:14:41.080]  they're fiercely independent smart patriotic people and they know they're going into bondage
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:46.040]  and 600 of their islands are being handed over to bankers privately they're saying well
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:50.280]  goldman sacks owns this much we're going to give all their top bankers their own private islands
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:55.880]  that's mainstream london telegraph and bbc but they report it like it's good and they're taking
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:15:02.120]  over their entire infrastructure and the people see their entire country being given to the banker
[2:15:02.120 --> 2:15:07.080]  criminals that came in a decade ago and took over their government and signed them on to all this
[2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:13.880]  and uh that's amazing information bob well i hope it's right and i hope they do it and uh
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:21.240]  uh and i think they will uh i know you were on the radio and tv over there uh and i was as well
[2:15:21.800 --> 2:15:28.360]  and what i told him was this number one you get out of the euro it's too expensive for you
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:34.680]  number two you default on your debt the bank has made the money up out of thin air and they
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:39.320]  should have never made the the loans in the first place because they knew the financial and economic
[2:15:39.320 --> 2:15:45.320]  situation in greece for many years number three go back to the drachma and make sure it's
[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:52.360]  nominally or undervalued so that you can compete with your exports and you'll have all kinds of
[2:15:52.360 --> 2:16:00.840]  tourists coming to greece could be because it'll be uh an inexpensive destination and leave the euro
[2:16:00.840 --> 2:16:06.360]  zone and the bankers are going to try to punish them and it's going to be painful but it's going
[2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:14.200]  to be a more painful road to submit to them submission means 30 to 50 years of absolute bondage
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:21.160]  and as a matter of fact if i don't know if you saw this in the news in romania uh the uh
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:29.880]  we'll call them the p.m uh said uh and implemented all kinds of austerity things and the people
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:37.080]  are ready to throw them out of office and the course the loans to the same bankers and let me
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:43.240]  put it this way if greece gets rid of pump and pump a drill and says to the bankers no we're not
[2:16:43.240 --> 2:16:49.800]  going to pay you and they put other people in government and i'm sure they they want a bloodless
[2:16:49.800 --> 2:16:55.320]  change uh if that happens it'll happen all over europe that's right and people are like well why
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:17:02.440]  do i care about iceland or greece because as they go so goes the rest of the planet well you can
[2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:10.120]  start off with the irish or furious um anglo irish bank uh comes back um yesterday they wanted
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  almost enough money which is equal to the revenue that they take in in ireland i mean to stay alive
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:25.880]  to stay in business and the people are getting furious there uh once the spanish wake up uh
[2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:30.040]  all hell will break loose uh the portuguese are a little bit different i've lived in those
[2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:36.200]  countries so i know what the temperaments are and then in italy once the buttons push delgo bananas
[2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:43.560]  uh they're um very nervous people would put it that way and uh but uh and then that'll spread
[2:17:43.560 --> 2:17:51.000]  to eastern europe uh which is already in dire straits which is why don't americans i mean americans
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:58.040]  are getting angry but we were always known as the most explosive aggressive violent greedy to defend
[2:17:58.040 --> 2:18:04.200]  our freedom why are we so submissive the tv the fluoride the drugs the brainwashing we are literally
[2:18:04.200 --> 2:18:10.040]  in a coma but we're starting to come out of that coma you're absolutely right we are and you know
[2:18:10.040 --> 2:18:15.880]  you're not going to convince everybody and you don't have to all you have to do is inform 15 to
[2:18:15.880 --> 2:18:21.320]  20 of the people who are intelligent uh who are willing to go forward and say no i'm not going
[2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:27.560]  to do that or i'm not going to take that and at some point in time that will come to the four
[2:18:27.560 --> 2:18:34.120]  but in the meantime they get educated and then when we get there what drives people just like a drives
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:41.000]  armies is their belly and if they're not getting fed they get to be very ordinary no matter what
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:48.680]  kind of citizens they are in what country and so i believe that when unemployment loss of homes
[2:18:49.480 --> 2:18:56.760]  cars job living under the bridge uh when you get enough people doing that uh then the governments
[2:18:56.760 --> 2:19:04.120]  get problems and i do not think the american military will come in and take illegal orders from
[2:19:04.760 --> 2:19:09.480]  a non-citizen who says he's president of the united states and go around around people up
[2:19:09.480 --> 2:19:15.160]  or shoot them that's the key that's the key so what is the john warner defense authorization act
[2:19:15.160 --> 2:19:23.880]  state what does the brigade homeland state they know that once that starts true leaders will arise
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:28.840]  for either uh you know uh good patriotic reasons or they'll see which way the wind's blowing and
[2:19:28.840 --> 2:19:35.880]  want power they openly say they're going to move to block governors even remove governors claim that
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:40.200]  they speak for the states at the federal level because of the governor's council and they're
[2:19:40.200 --> 2:19:46.040]  going to move and assassinate or attempt to assassinate governors and legislative leaders
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:51.800]  that lead the charge out of this coming dark age let's talk about that bob when we come back

[2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:11.480]  circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[2:23:11.480 --> 2:23:16.040]  silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and
[2:23:16.040 --> 2:23:20.600]  it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put

[2:23:54.760 --> 2:24:13.240]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com
[2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:18.760]  by the way i mean those weren't just words as we went to break
[2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:28.760]  if you read the john warner defense authorization act in 2007 it says they're going to take over
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:34.840]  all of the national guard federalize it even further take it away from the states and prepare
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:41.080]  to go up against legislatures governors civil unrest we've got british ministry of defense
[2:24:41.080 --> 2:24:47.800]  report 2007 saying the same thing they are getting ready to block the people worldwide
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:53.000]  from taking their governments back peacefully through their state and local governments
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:57.320]  bob Chapman the entire architecture is aimed at that do you agree that's a key point they're
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:03.880]  going to attack absolutely and they're going to have to get the cooperation of the military to
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:13.080]  do that and i don't know that they're going to get that in fact when people ask me i say the best
[2:25:13.080 --> 2:25:19.640]  thing for you to do when that sort of situation happens is talk to the military and you know
[2:25:19.640 --> 2:25:23.960]  see what their attitude is and if they're not going to follow the orders you join them
[2:25:26.840 --> 2:25:32.600]  but again they know political legitimate state leadership trumps the out of control feds that
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:37.800]  are foreign banker run engaged in this takeover they're worried about that legitimate
[2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:42.600]  movement coalitions of states standing together that's why they're already trying to block the
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:48.440]  states rights movement we've got to accelerate that states rights awakening like our lives depend
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:56.040]  on it because the life of this republic is on a razor's edge well that's an understatement
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:26:03.160]  because these people are working 24 7 to force the people of the world to accept world government
[2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:09.800]  and that's part of it controlling people within your own country and that's what that legislation
[2:26:09.800 --> 2:26:16.360]  is about as you pointed out and i hope it doesn't come to that but a very well might
[2:26:17.160 --> 2:26:22.040]  and but i think we're going to get help from the military i don't think they're going to be an
[2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:29.800]  adversary well i tend to think more and more you're right bomb this is certainly a struggle
[2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:35.640]  we're in though everything individuals do now every person you wake up every person you reach
[2:26:35.640 --> 2:26:40.600]  out to even if they laugh at you now they won't laugh down the road the maximum effort is needed
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:44.600]  now in the info war i want to come back go to calls bob and some other news items i want to
[2:26:44.600 --> 2:26:50.520]  get your view on but first uh in the last week what's your breakdown of the economy gold breaking
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:56.680]  out bloomberg saying the majority of future options on gold for the month of december are 1500
[2:26:56.680 --> 2:27:03.960]  or above that's an 18 plus increase in gold are predicting uh what's your take on it first of all
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:10.120]  they try it all week to get gold down uh were relatively unsuccessful and they really poured
[2:27:10.120 --> 2:27:18.920]  it on uh right now it goes off three dollars but the the stocks are very strong uh i don't know
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:27.160]  whether silver traded over twenty dollars today uh but the last time i saw it it was 1995 and
[2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:31.960]  that's pretty close so i can't i think in a way silver is leading the way here and i think there's
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:38.680]  some really big hitters in there who have been trepidatious previously because of what happened
[2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:46.280]  to the huntsman in 1980 and i think they're finally coming around and saying uh let's go for it and
[2:27:46.280 --> 2:27:50.520]  i think that's why you're seeing the move that you're seeing in silver and every time they
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:55.240]  time they try to try to knock it down and they get their heads handed to them and the same with gold
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:28:02.680]  it's big physical buying uh they had to hold gold down at silver as much as they could because they
[2:28:02.680 --> 2:28:08.920]  wanted to go into the holiday weekend making the both of them look weak and making the markets
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:17.400]  look strong so they took the the market from 10 000 to 10 400 in 30 and very low volume and
[2:28:17.400 --> 2:28:23.240]  after the first uh after the holiday and the market may very well start to turn back down again
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:29.480]  it's window dressing i think two of the important things that will come out this week uh number one
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:37.640]  is the a death free america act which is hr 46 46 and they want to put a 1 percent sales tax on
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:44.040]  credit card debit card and securities transactions have you heard about that alex yeah it's a toben
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:51.960]  that's an individual kind of vat on financials that's right and so uh the chances of it getting
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:29:00.200]  passed i believe are slim and that's fortunate for us but just to put the thing up shows you
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:06.200]  where they're headed one on the other hand the administration saying to a business well we're
[2:29:06.200 --> 2:29:11.800]  going to get you some breaks uh so that we can revive the economy and it's all smoke and mirrors
[2:29:11.800 --> 2:29:21.080]  the second one is the automatic ira act of two 2010 which is far more dangerous it's a mandatory
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:27.560]  mandatory payroll tax and all workers of three percent to be used to purchase government retirement
[2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:33.800]  bonds which the loot stay there so they are coming with vat financial taxes on everyone
[2:29:33.800 --> 2:29:37.880]  the health care taxes pass they're trying to implement that they're trying to come in with
[2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:43.160]  retirement taxes i mean folks the austerity's here the bankers looting the hell out of us and giving
[2:29:43.160 --> 2:29:47.640]  themselves record bonuses they just got started bob continue with that on the other side
[2:29:51.160 --> 2:29:57.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:33:38.920 --> 2:33:45.000]  script and it mirrored the arizona trailer that was scenes in the film uh robert olrigus told
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:49.480]  ain't it cool news that he did cut those scenes and that indeed that stuff in the trailer was from
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:56.600]  the film because he was worried about violence he admitted it could cause problems since then
[2:33:56.600 --> 2:34:03.080]  his producer has spun it that oh alex didn't have the script and that's not the movie i haven't seen
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:08.600]  it it's been out it came out this morning i'm gonna try to go see it this evening if i have time i
[2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:13.080]  don't want to but since i've talked about it so much i have to and i've just got work piled for
[2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:18.440]  the rafters i'm not complaining i just it's going to be pure torture uh but uh sunday i'll be live
[2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:22.280]  four to six p.m i'll be able to give you a brief report on it i don't want to talk about it anymore
[2:34:22.280 --> 2:34:27.160]  i pray there's no violence but people are spending it saying oh you know alex is saying this is a
[2:34:27.160 --> 2:34:31.400]  race war film i'm saying the script and what his crew told me and what that arizona trailer
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:37.160]  showed is race war rodrigus says he edited that out now we're gonna find out if that's true but if
[2:34:37.160 --> 2:34:45.480]  he did edit it out that doesn't make me wrong it means he went and changed it okay and we have the
[2:34:45.480 --> 2:34:49.720]  film commission head saying well there is some pretty serious stuff we don't know if we're going
[2:34:49.720 --> 2:34:53.880]  to give them funding so and that and last night i was getting ready to watch i just got the tv
[2:34:53.880 --> 2:35:00.360]  workers i never watched broadcast tv and i got it all hooked up and everything and i was watching abc
[2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:04.520]  before nightline came home with their hit piece on me and it was local news talking about is it
[2:35:04.520 --> 2:35:09.160]  going to be denied because of the race war stuff so it's in the new york times it's all over the news

[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:40.120]  your time more on the economy you're getting into all these new taxes they're trying to ram through
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:46.120]  and you hardly hear any news coverage of it and then i want to go to calls well isn't it all that
[2:38:46.120 --> 2:38:53.480]  that's what really gets me and uh this automatic ira act uh it's three percent that they want to
[2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:59.800]  pass and i i think they can pass it and uh i was told by washington people i know there
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:06.120]  that they're planning on jacking it up within three years to 15 percent and um this is a foot in
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:17.320]  the door because within that act it also says if it's passed that they would consider uh
[2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:27.240]  implementing the takeover of retirement plans and putting them into what they call retirement bonds
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:34.120]  or guaranteed government annuities and that's what they're going to go after if they get this thing
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:42.120]  passed and that'll be next year and there's about the private plans have about 4.3 trillion
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:49.480]  and they want it and uh so they can keep on having plenty of money to subject us and have
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:54.760]  their wars and and all the things that they want to do but this is very important legislation
[2:39:54.760 --> 2:40:01.400]  and i'm glad i got a uh a good fresh look at it we've been talking about this for over a year
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:07.160]  uh as far as the market's concerned i next next week i think it'll stop down i think gold and
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:15.160]  silver will break out to new highs uh particularly silver and uh and so i i see you know very firm
[2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:25.080]  markets uh in gold and silver next week um the volume is not enough for the government
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:31.960]  to sustain the stock market uh people are leaving in droves and a lot of them are going into u.s
[2:40:31.960 --> 2:40:37.080]  treasuries which are in the bubble and then people say to me well how do i show them and i tell them
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:44.920]  don't well what does that mean that the majority or or or uh the largest group uh is the way bloomberg
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:51.960]  put it uh the most popular option in wall street on gold is 1500 by december
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:59.160]  well they figure that the price of gold is going up and of course uh the government will do everything
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:04.600]  possible to keep it down but they're not going to be successful and uh we should get up by the end
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:11.080]  of the year to 15 or 1600 you got to remember our official inflation since 1980 would have
[2:41:11.080 --> 2:41:19.880]  gold at 2400 an ounce in real inflation uh via john um williams who you've had on the on the program
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:28.200]  eminent economist uh he um is calling for $7,600 in round figures all right let me stop you
[2:41:28.920 --> 2:41:36.280]  go ahead let me go ahead and finish no i was finished bob i want to go to these calls but
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:41.000]  they snuck the income tax through in 1913 didn't really implement it until the
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:47.400]  1950s for the general public they've snuck through so many other taxes and and and go back
[2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:53.480]  because i've seen that in the news but just tiny blurbs they've got multiple bills to create a vat
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:42:00.600]  on all financial transactions debit cards banking you name it which sets the president to track all
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:05.560]  purchases control what you do i mean it's an incredible robbery they're coming in trying to
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:10.040]  make you put money in government retirement accounts basically expanding the social security tax
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:15.800]  that they rob as soon as the money comes in i mean that's amazing list that legislation again
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:20.040]  but both those pieces because uh you're right that's not even on the radar screen and they're
[2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:28.120]  trying to sneak it through right now well there was a hr 4 6 4 6 was the uh was the piece that was
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:36.360]  the 1 percent uh transaction tax and um from there's no co-sponsors uh there was one just
[2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:40.840]  one person who sponsored it but i think it's a trial balloon i think he was put up to it
[2:42:40.840 --> 2:42:47.880]  and i think they want to bring the fact is in that you just mentioned in later and what is later
[2:42:47.880 --> 2:42:55.640]  probably after the election and uh and also with this uh automatic ira act if they think they can
[2:42:55.640 --> 2:43:02.280]  get a pass they'll put it through before the election um my guess is they won't be able to do that
[2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:07.960]  okay one final one final point we're going to calls uh curtain demo wrote a story uh last night
[2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:13.160]  and it's been confirmed gun confiscation in response to hurricane url now here's another
[2:43:13.160 --> 2:43:17.800]  headline from the examiner north carolina governor suspends gun rights state of emergency order
[2:43:17.800 --> 2:43:22.360]  makes criminals of concealed handgun permit holders sports shooters and hunters so they're
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:28.040]  saying during emergencies you can't own guns this is the time you need your guns we saw katrina
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:33.560]  this is their policy to set the precedent and the idea that anytime there's an emergency you
[2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:41.000]  can't have guns this is amazing well impeach the governor that's what i told the people in greece
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:46.760]  if you can't impeach him get him out of there absolutely this is outrageous donovan in texas
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:54.520]  you're on the air uh yes um i have two questions is that okay yes sir all right bob tapman uh
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:43:59.800]  do you believe that the u.s would never return to its original state unless the federal reserve
[2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:08.040]  is abolished well first of all we do need the federal reserve abolished and the the uh the work
[2:44:08.040 --> 2:44:13.960]  that they do should be turned back to the treasury department where it was in the first place before
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:20.680]  they passed the what i think is an illegal fed federal reserve act uh as far as going back to
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:27.240]  the constitution the only way we're going to do that is by electing people who were willing to
[2:44:27.240 --> 2:44:34.120]  take us back that way and not act like the people who are in office now um should have that if we
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:39.160]  can't accomplish that um i don't even want to contemplate what's going to happen in america
[2:44:40.760 --> 2:44:44.440]  okay uh in uh alex zones uh
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:51.000]  it's kind of staggering to kind of like look at the mind control of the american people
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:57.880]  today uh leaving a african-american a person in the dfw area of texas uh i could really see the
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:04.520]  mind control on uh uh on the black people uh getting really caught up in the motions with obama
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:09.880]  and stuff and like be talking to uh to these people it really is telling me that he could
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:15.480]  really do whatever he wants and i could see all the uh the mind control that like placed on us
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:20.360]  over these last i mean i don't know how long but it seemed like they just feel like he could
[2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:25.720]  do whatever he wants to and they're okay with that i mean i i even asked somebody to tell me that
[2:45:25.720 --> 2:45:29.880]  obama is doing what he can for the for the american people but they also believe that the
[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:34.920]  illuminati controls everything so i say well if obama is being controlled by the illuminati
[2:45:34.920 --> 2:45:38.840]  what makes you think that he's doing this stuff for the american donovan donovan great points and
[2:45:38.840 --> 2:45:43.720]  i appreciate your call i'm gonna move quicker so i can get to others but it's just like democrats
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:48.680]  wouldn't wake up to bill clinton when he was an open crook and lying to him and republicans still
[2:45:48.680 --> 2:45:53.400]  think there were wmds and iraq even when the government admits there weren't they still think
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:58.120]  bush is good and it's the same thing they get bought into somebody like they're getting bought into
[2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:07.080]  glenn back and he can promote vat taxes he can promote all this stuff because he says the right
[2:46:07.080 --> 2:46:12.920]  thing one day and then the wrong thing the next and people get sold on an idea that somebody's
[2:46:12.920 --> 2:46:18.840]  their friend and then they can't admit they've been bamboozled and it's just that simple uh julio
[2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:24.760]  in illinois you're on the air go ahead pleasure to talk to you both uh bob chatman god bless you
[2:46:24.760 --> 2:46:32.200]  uh to google search term ideas ties in the this entire broadcast today um with the abc attack
[2:46:32.200 --> 2:46:39.320]  piece it's disgusting to see mickey maus sink uh this low um with that horrible attack piece on
[2:46:39.320 --> 2:46:47.000]  you alex uh mockingbird media possible search term exposing prescott bush in the whole world war
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:53.880]  two start up of the cia operation and you can show video clips of glenn back uh well you have to do
[2:46:53.880 --> 2:47:02.680]  simple searches like bush's bush family hitler bush family nazis would do it and then that would
[2:47:02.680 --> 2:47:07.240]  bring up all the videos and documents and london guardian and ap admitting it most people still
[2:47:07.240 --> 2:47:12.520]  don't know about that uh if you wanted to expose the abc media thing you would search the term
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:16.200]  hell you've done it we've never failed but we're here we're at the end of the show and i don't
[2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:22.040]  know if just plugging it a few times will do it over the weekend but let's try uh demonizing alex
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:29.000]  jones search the term demonizing alex jones great story by curt nemo that has the uh
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:34.520]  nightline piece posted he breaks down all the brainwashing and people can search the term
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:45.320]  demonizing alex jones demonizing alex jones d e m o n i z i n g demonizing alex jones
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:50.120]  let's make that the search term so people know how i'm being demonized and how they're demonizing
[2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:56.360]  all of us who love liberty through you know using alex jones as the logo to you know to to then tear
[2:47:56.360 --> 2:48:03.480]  down demonizing alex jones let's do that as a search term uh and we could also search the term
[2:48:03.480 --> 2:48:10.200]  gun confiscation uh gun confiscation that will bring them to gun confiscation in response to
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:15.960]  hurricane url we'll also just have the five-year anniversary of gun confiscation uh in new orland
[2:48:15.960 --> 2:48:23.080]  so let's search two things today gun confiscation and separately demonizing alex jones you have
[2:48:23.080 --> 2:48:27.160]  never failed and that's a good idea but we've got to write an article with all the latest stuff
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:31.160]  so it'll be number one so let's do that next week i'll have watson when i'm out with ventura
[2:48:31.160 --> 2:48:35.240]  i'm gonna be on the road a few days with ventura i'll be here for at the end of the week uh watson's
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:39.720]  going to be here on tuesday wednesday and probably thursday if i'm unable to get in on time i may get
[2:48:39.720 --> 2:48:43.960]  it on time on thursday uh but i'm gonna be on the road again with ventura it's top secret i'll just
[2:48:43.960 --> 2:48:50.600]  leave it at that in multiple states with the governor uh but um again demonizing alex jones
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:55.320]  is the one search term and then we'll do gun confiscation as the other and next week we'll
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:59.960]  do the uh because folks we can't do it now because we need to make sure we have fresh stories out to
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:05.000]  make it so when people search it they get the intel or somebody else will put out this info
