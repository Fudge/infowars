[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.800 --> 00:21.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.560 --> 00:39.400]  the great quake of Japan thank you for joining us 8.9 mega earthquake causes chaos in Japan
[00:39.400 --> 00:46.520]  multiple waves of tsunamis day-losing large parts of major towns and cities hundreds and
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.280]  hundreds confirmed dead thousands probably dead our hearts and prayers go out to all of them
[00:53.640 --> 00:58.120]  we're going to be going through here live on air the maps the details exactly
[00:58.920 --> 01:03.480]  what's unfolding there the latest we've been trying to get a hold of mr. Corbett who lives in
[01:03.480 --> 01:09.560]  Japan who's a contributor to this radio slash TV transmission but we're unable to get a hold of him
[01:09.560 --> 01:15.400]  I want to open the phones up specifically for people in the areas affected in Japan
[01:15.400 --> 01:25.080]  or nearby areas for your reports of course the biggest issue is the reported nuclear emergency
[01:26.280 --> 01:33.560]  that is unfolding a nuclear emergency declared in Japan at a large facility that has six different
[01:33.560 --> 01:41.400]  reactors one of the reactors has lost its coolant and under Japanese law they are ordered to declare
[01:41.400 --> 01:48.200]  a national emergency whenever the coolant has failed and there's the headline
[01:48.200 --> 01:56.200]  from Paul Joseph Watson Japan declares nuclear emergency after devastating earthquake attempts
[01:56.200 --> 02:03.960]  to cool malfunctioning reactor cores at the Fukushima number one nuclear plant have failed
[02:03.960 --> 02:18.440]  and so we're going to be going through all of that today record quake unleashes tsunami
[02:18.440 --> 02:26.920]  on japan again a massive 8.9 magnitude earthquake rocked northeast japan on friday afternoon
[02:26.920 --> 02:34.600]  shedding a nuclear plant ablaze and unleashing a 10 meter tsunami that tossed ships inland and again
[02:34.600 --> 02:41.800]  left a lot of people dead here's another headline hundreds killed in tsunami after 8.9 earthquake
[02:42.760 --> 02:50.520]  in japan a continuing organ the state of oregon advises coastal residents to evacuate that's
[02:50.520 --> 03:01.240]  Reuters that's here in the united states thousands roam tokyo streets stations after quake that's
[03:01.240 --> 03:06.520]  out of associated press here's another one out of the west coast of the united states
[03:06.520 --> 03:14.680]  deputies knock on doors to evacuate washington town sheriff's deputies and firefighters in
[03:14.680 --> 03:20.120]  washington's graze harbour county are knocking on doors in low-flying areas of the small coastal
[03:20.120 --> 03:28.120]  community of mo clips handing out tsunami warning fliers and urging residents to evacuate
[03:29.160 --> 03:36.280]  continuing tsunami waves sweep hawaii no major damage yet in the first waves that's out of
[03:36.280 --> 03:43.160]  associated press again was in my stack here japan declares nuclear emergency after devastating
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.120]  earthquake and this could melt down like a Chernobyl they still according to the latest
[03:48.120 --> 03:54.840]  reports out just minutes ago uh cannot get the coolant back into the reactor core and then of
[03:54.840 --> 04:02.600]  course it can cause a china syndrome situation and it will blow sky high ejecting radiation
[04:02.600 --> 04:07.800]  into the atmosphere of course in the past we were worried about this um in the past they
[04:07.800 --> 04:14.360]  didn't use du in warfare but now they do and the pentagon four years ago and again last year said
[04:14.360 --> 04:21.960]  we may bomb the boshir and other reactor sites in iran with bunker busters that will eject
[04:22.840 --> 04:29.080]  the and the reactors are now operating and the centrifuges are operating uh both the purification
[04:29.080 --> 04:33.880]  facilities and some of the reactors are the beginning stages of being fired up that will then
[04:33.880 --> 04:39.000]  cause another chernobyl type situation but now the government waves the magic wand and says
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.680]  carbon dioxide is bad for you we got to shut down all the power plants that are coal powered
[04:45.240 --> 04:52.680]  but radiation look at the naked body scanners no osha no radiation studies they admit it's high
[04:52.680 --> 04:59.800]  powered radiation they just say hey it's good for the tsa it's good for you so hey this is nutritious
[04:59.800 --> 05:10.600]  what's happening in tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really
[05:10.600 --> 05:15.800]  says that the state is god the united states is now recognized globally as one of the most

[07:03.080 --> 07:08.200]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[07:08.200 --> 07:13.400]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[07:13.400 --> 07:18.280]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[07:18.280 --> 07:23.560]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[07:23.560 --> 07:28.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[07:28.840 --> 07:33.960]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[07:33.960 --> 07:38.520]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[07:38.520 --> 07:43.160]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[07:43.160 --> 07:47.480]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[08:03.160 --> 08:19.080]  talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:34.120 --> 08:42.200]  okay ladies and gentlemen barely made it back in time here because i was so busy working on
[08:42.200 --> 08:52.760]  guests but we do have a top astro physicist who has one of the most accurate histories of being
[08:52.760 --> 08:59.480]  able to predict not just weather patterns but also tectonic activity we've had him on before
[08:59.480 --> 09:07.080]  but will you please print me his bio asap so i can get that out for folks we're also working on
[09:07.080 --> 09:12.600]  getting mr corbett at the corbett report who lives in japan who's an american living in japan
[09:13.560 --> 09:16.760]  and who contributes to this broadcast joining us but we're unable to get a hold of him
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.640]  in japan i am going to open the phones up for japanese living in japan americans living in
[09:23.640 --> 09:30.120]  japan germans living in japan anybody as long as you can speak english uh please call into the
[09:30.120 --> 09:38.200]  show and give us your report on what's happening in japan now for those out there that just joined
[09:38.200 --> 09:45.320]  us uh we're going to be looking in detail at the record 8.9 quake and it's exponential
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.600]  it doubles every time it goes up the scale a two is a doubling of a one a three is a doubling of a
[09:52.600 --> 10:01.400]  two a four is a doubling of a three and up to 10 i mean a 10 on the Richter scale is something out
[10:01.400 --> 10:07.240]  of a movie with the plate splitting apart and lava shooting 10 000 feet in the air
[10:09.960 --> 10:15.800]  in fact guys just to illustrate this at a childlike level we go to youtube and pull up fundar the
[10:15.800 --> 10:21.320]  barbarian like i think we even have that saved i meant to play it joking a month ago about everybody
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.360]  saying planet x is coming or a comet's coming on the 15th and total destruction is going to rain
[10:26.360 --> 10:32.040]  and the hundreds of emails i get an hour and the feverish phone calls of people hyperventilating that
[10:32.040 --> 10:39.160]  they know i know the end of the world is coming uh in uh in five days what's the 15th is that next
[10:40.520 --> 10:47.240]  wednesday or something what day tuesday i mean people are just completely freaking out thinking
[10:47.240 --> 10:51.880]  it's the end of the world i'm not saying it's the end of the world the media will take it out of
[10:51.880 --> 10:57.640]  context later and edit this together where i am saying that but that's fine uh the issue is it is
[10:57.640 --> 11:05.480]  kind of spooky to have everybody calling up here uh you know saying the comet's coming the 15th
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.760]  you're hiding in a bunker you work for the new world order you know it's coming no i'm going
[11:10.760 --> 11:15.480]  to be here the 15th i don't like to tempt fate and have a car wreck or something happens but i'm
[11:15.480 --> 11:20.280]  i'm gonna i'm gonna be here and i don't believe it's the end of the world i don't believe that a
[11:20.280 --> 11:24.920]  comet is coming i don't believe that we're all going to be killed i don't believe an asteroid
[11:24.920 --> 11:34.520]  is coming uh and just because japan has been hit by a big earthquake uh the biggest in recorded uh
[11:34.520 --> 11:41.080]  modern science the last hundred and so years that they've had rictor scales shut up listen
[11:41.080 --> 11:49.240]  there's a reason they build uh their houses out of paper and balsa wood in japan and that's
[11:49.240 --> 11:54.200]  because they get hit by record earthquakes there because they're on the pacific rim great ring
[11:54.200 --> 12:01.960]  of fire they're right where two big plates smashed together it you know that's they have a lot of
[12:01.960 --> 12:09.720]  earthquakes in chili they have a lot of earthquakes in peru they have a lot of earthquakes uh in
[12:11.880 --> 12:17.960]  hawaii because they're all on hot spots i mean look there's big giant tectonic plates
[12:17.960 --> 12:27.560]  a couple miles thick floating around on top of molten lava and so uh the only thing that is constant
[12:27.560 --> 12:34.840]  on this planet is change i mean it wasn't a comet and it wasn't the easter bunny that caused Pompeii
[12:34.840 --> 12:42.200]  to be covered by mount visuvius and for thousands of romans to be encased instantly in hot lava uh
[12:42.200 --> 12:51.640]  and burning ash okay so so these type of things happen these type of things go on these type of
[12:51.640 --> 12:58.760]  things unfold and i'll bet you a million dollars that we're all still gonna be here on the 16th of
[12:58.760 --> 13:06.760]  march and that a comet or planet x or the reptoid command ship the common empire uh is not coming
[13:06.760 --> 13:12.600]  to get us we have we do have fundar i'll bet you a million bucks folks hypothetically i mean obviously
[13:12.600 --> 13:18.280]  i'm not literally betting you but i'm gonna be here next tuesday live on air braving uh the
[13:18.280 --> 13:24.040]  runaway planet that is supposedly going to pull our atmosphere off and cause tectonic plates to
[13:24.040 --> 13:30.680]  be ejected thousands of feet in the air instantly and lava shooting out and the end of our civilization
[13:30.680 --> 13:38.040]  and then thousands of years later a super science system rises with goblins flying around and
[13:38.040 --> 13:50.440]  charlie scene warlocks here it is fundar the barbarian the year 1994 from out of space comes a
[13:50.440 --> 13:55.080]  runaway planet between the earth and the moon unleashing cosmic destruction
[14:00.360 --> 14:02.280]  man civilization is cast in ruin
[14:02.280 --> 14:11.960]  two thousand years later earth is reborn a strange new world rises from the old
[14:11.960 --> 14:20.600]  a world of savagery super science and sorcery but one man bursts his vans to fight for justice
[14:20.600 --> 14:26.360]  with his companions full flow the mark and princess ariel he fits his strength his courage
[14:26.360 --> 14:33.640]  and his fabulous sunsword against the forces of evil
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.960]  he is fundar the barbarian
[14:40.520 --> 14:45.160]  well that's a blast from the past i remember being about five years old in dalis watching that
[14:45.160 --> 14:49.800]  and loving it on television because he only really had cartoons on saturday morning so once a week my
[14:49.800 --> 14:55.160]  mom would let me watch cartoons and sit there eating rice crispies and scrambled eggs and
[14:55.160 --> 15:02.600]  watching fundar the barbarian and and see in 1999 the comet didn't come and kill us it's 2011
[15:03.320 --> 15:09.640]  but comets do hit the earth and we can't trust the government to put a space base weapon system
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.880]  up there to blast them because they would just use it as a weapon system against us here on the
[15:13.880 --> 15:21.080]  planet but i'm going to try to walk through all this now and talk to james in japan and others
[15:21.080 --> 15:26.840]  uh if you just joined us uh here today
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.040]  if you just joined us obviously uh you know the big news uh it's everywhere
[15:38.600 --> 15:44.760]  but the different angle we're going to go with is what manipulates the inside of the earth and
[15:44.760 --> 15:52.840]  its magnetic field well it just so happens that two things uh coincided uh together
[15:54.520 --> 16:00.440]  in the last 48 hours or less starting um
[16:04.120 --> 16:12.200]  wednesday morning several different things happened and actually the daily mail is reporting on one
[16:12.200 --> 16:19.880]  of them is the japanese earthquake the latest natural disaster to have been caused by the super
[16:19.880 --> 16:26.440]  moon the powerful tsunami that today slamming japan's eastern coast comes just two days after
[16:26.440 --> 16:31.560]  warnings that the movement of the moon could trigger unprecedented events we have a leading solar
[16:31.560 --> 16:37.080]  physicist who particularly specializes in the moon joining us coming up uh astra
[16:37.080 --> 16:46.040]  of sites predicted that the march 19th a week tomorrow the so-called super moon will be closer
[16:46.040 --> 16:54.200]  to the earth than any time since 1992 only 221,567 miles away and that this is a gravitational
[16:54.200 --> 17:00.760]  pull will bring chaos to earth and others uh predicted it as well and we're going to be
[17:00.760 --> 17:07.720]  going over some of that but the daily mail is reporting that also we forget what hit us about
[17:07.720 --> 17:16.200]  36 hours ago and that was a massive solar flare that was directed right at the earth and basically
[17:16.200 --> 17:28.360]  hit uh the southern uh area of the planet uh antarctica blasting uh south africa uh and uh
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.840]  chile and other areas and there was some electronic problems and some interference
[17:32.840 --> 17:38.200]  with satellites uh reported in the last 36 hours uh in fact here's a report out of
[17:38.200 --> 17:45.160]  eye africa solar flare warning in south africa the hermana space weather warning center
[17:46.600 --> 17:52.920]  on sunday said a large solar flare was currently being experienced and then more flares again
[17:52.920 --> 17:57.480]  were fired in the next two days uh hitting over the last four days because it takes about a day
[17:57.480 --> 18:02.280]  for those to get here takes seven minutes or so for the light to get here but for the actual
[18:02.280 --> 18:07.560]  radiation that travels at a different speed uh the flare itself it it can take two to three days
[18:07.560 --> 18:11.960]  and so that's going on got the earth just being hit by these powerful magnetic fields
[18:11.960 --> 18:16.600]  and all sorts of different radiation and the wavelength you got the moon close to the earth
[18:16.600 --> 18:21.800]  but don't worry they're going to blame it on uh global warming or something you can be assured
[18:21.800 --> 18:27.640]  of that uh now i want to go to james in japan james in japan give us the report on what you're seeing
[18:27.640 --> 18:37.640]  sir yeah hi alex how are you good good go ahead taking well um it was a pretty devastating
[18:37.640 --> 18:44.440]  earthquake i'm located in tokyo and even before the earthquake happened this kind of comes back
[18:44.440 --> 18:50.200]  to what you're saying about some magnetic field or whatever you felt something was wrong i mean
[18:50.200 --> 18:55.160]  there were no clouds in the sky and it started to rain and i've never seen that before it just
[18:55.160 --> 19:01.400]  got extremely hot and then all of a sudden i was luckily i was in the park with my son it was his
[19:01.400 --> 19:08.520]  birthday today and i personally felt like i was having a convulsion and i asked him i said either
[19:08.520 --> 19:15.880]  i'm having a convulsion or this the earth is like moving very very hard he says dad i think we're
[19:15.880 --> 19:22.440]  going to die and people in the park were running and there's like pretty much nowhere that they
[19:22.440 --> 19:29.880]  could run to and it's a safe place the park and it's away from buildings but i personally have a
[19:30.680 --> 19:39.240]  about a 1940 locomotive in the park and i took my son into that locomotive and solid steel
[19:39.240 --> 19:45.000]  well james thank you for stay there no i don't don't thank me for having on the show thank you

[24:13.960 --> 24:23.640]  we're talking to james at japan got david waiting here's richard corbin weatheraction.com
[24:24.200 --> 24:30.680]  he's a meteorologist astrophysicist consultant owner of businesses weather action which even
[24:30.680 --> 24:36.040]  the mainstream media has had to admit because he's on record predicted with over 90 percent certainty
[24:36.040 --> 24:39.880]  exactly what's going to happen with the weather a year out nobody else can do that because the
[24:39.880 --> 24:46.840]  the main meteorologist don't follow the moon the moon controls the oceans it controls a lot of tectonic
[24:46.840 --> 24:53.160]  activity it controls how much solar winds are hitting the earth as a shield when it's between
[24:53.160 --> 25:01.160]  the earth and the sun it's a space wind tunnel out there he's coming up to get into what could
[25:01.160 --> 25:07.240]  be triggering this but let's talk to james in japan so james where are you in japan what did you
[25:07.240 --> 25:12.600]  witness you and your son had to escape to the park to the high ground what happened
[25:13.800 --> 25:19.800]  yeah well we were in the park when it happened so we escaped into an old locomotive they keep
[25:19.800 --> 25:26.040]  in the park for kids to see and so we were pretty safe fortunately but what made this earthquake
[25:26.040 --> 25:32.040]  so different than others which japan has hit quite a bit by earthquakes besides the intensity
[25:32.040 --> 25:37.880]  was the length of it i mean this must have lasted about a minute and a half to two minutes
[25:37.880 --> 25:43.720]  it was long and you just basically felt like it was over you're gonna die well you know it was a
[25:44.440 --> 25:54.440]  you know it was an 8.9 and we're showing video right now of houses buildings like tinker toys
[25:54.440 --> 26:01.000]  just being pushed by the giant tsunami explosions and i've got some bad news i want you to continue
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.040]  james and go to david pressure is rising at the damaged japanese nuclear power plant
[26:06.840 --> 26:14.120]  raising fears it could melt down how close are you to this particular nuclear reactor
[26:14.840 --> 26:22.440]  in this area of northeast of tokyo well that that nuclear plan that's maybe a few hundred
[26:22.440 --> 26:28.680]  miles away but the bad news about it is a japanese government on foraging like the american government
[26:28.680 --> 26:34.840]  never tells the truth all the time when there was previously a nuclear leak they never told you about
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.560]  it and other leaks came out that you know that they never told you about even though employees
[26:39.560 --> 26:46.680]  were radiated and killed so so it could be worse than we're even being told absolutely if you judge
[26:46.680 --> 26:54.040]  on what the government how they lied i'm gonna be i'm gonna be honest i don't like giant nuclear
[26:54.040 --> 27:00.360]  facilities they're too dangerous and and meanwhile the environmentalists want them instead of coal
[27:00.920 --> 27:08.360]  and coal is just fabulous and now i've seen the the greenies on tv on c-span saying go nuclear get
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.040]  rid of our plants and they're building nuclear reactors everywhere and there's only a matter of
[27:12.040 --> 27:17.560]  time to roll chair noble are you and your family concerned right now they're saying this plant
[27:17.560 --> 27:26.600]  could uh could uh go china syndrome and blow sky high i'm absolutely uh concerned and what
[27:26.600 --> 27:32.280]  makes it even more devastating for people is there's been no phone service all day so it's
[27:32.280 --> 27:37.560]  if you have like a rel if you weren't able to get home due to the fact that the trains have stopped
[27:37.560 --> 27:43.720]  in tokyo you can't even contact your family members to see if they're okay i own a house
[27:43.720 --> 27:50.680]  actually two hours north which is oceanfront and i can't even find out if my house was swept away
[27:51.160 --> 27:56.760]  by a tsunami and for and for ignorant people that don't know your regular phone services out
[27:56.760 --> 28:03.720]  you're calling us via uh computer phone yeah i'm calling uh via sky palace yeah that's what we
[28:03.720 --> 28:10.680]  thought uh people find contradictions when there are none uh well sir uh again uh where are you on
[28:10.680 --> 28:15.640]  the map and we'll put the name in and pull it up for people watching on present planet dot tv
[28:15.640 --> 28:22.840]  what's the name of the town you're in well i'm in uh in an area called naka megado in megado
[28:22.840 --> 28:29.160]  ward in tokyo so you're in tokyo and and and how bad is tokyo itself been hit
[28:31.480 --> 28:37.320]  well there's been uh for example there are water pipes that have burst in my building and uh
[28:37.320 --> 28:43.000]  elevators don't work in any buildings i had to run up nine flights of stairs to make sure
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.800]  my ex-wife and other son was okay um there are people who the there's a convenience store in
[28:49.800 --> 28:57.480]  every block and those are all full with people trying to uh get items like water and food so
[28:57.480 --> 29:02.360]  you know when somebody like you comes out and tells people uh you know in the event of a dollar
[29:02.360 --> 29:06.760]  collapse or whatever that you should really try and stock up on food i hope people take
[29:06.760 --> 29:12.200]  you seriously because they'll never know when uh when you need it and thanks to you i pretty much
[29:12.200 --> 29:19.240]  have stocked up so we were okay well thank god sir look i'm stocked up on food ammo guns and it's
[29:19.240 --> 29:24.680]  not that i live in fear it's that i live empowered and and i don't want to live in fear i would i
[29:24.680 --> 29:30.120]  would be afraid in my home at night if i didn't have firearms i mean what a i can't imagine the
[29:30.120 --> 29:35.960]  domesticated timid souls david we're gonna go to you real fast on the other side because it's
[29:35.960 --> 29:40.440]  live from japan we're gonna go ahead and get this top meteorologist piers richard corbin
[29:40.440 --> 29:44.520]  on as well at the same time with you we're gonna try to look at what could be triggering
[29:44.520 --> 29:49.320]  the massive increased tectonic activity the last two years there's a lot more earthquakes happening
[29:49.320 --> 29:57.480]  folks we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[29:57.480 --> 30:06.680]  network alex has told you that the mid east uprisings over food prices and shortages caused
[30:06.680 --> 30:11.720]  by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right here in the united states
[30:11.720 --> 30:17.400]  ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in february
[30:17.400 --> 30:23.160]  and pump prices are expected to reach five dollars a gallon because of shipping costs food is being
[30:23.160 --> 30:29.080]  priced out of the reach of millions of americans with an expected 35 jump in the next 60 days

[31:21.400 --> 31:26.520]  right you see he predicted the collapse of gm panty may friday mac and america's biggest mall
[31:26.520 --> 31:32.200]  owner general growth properties in fact barons called his work a dire prophecy recently he
[31:32.200 --> 31:36.360]  created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important

[33:16.680 --> 33:23.080]  all right we have meteorologist pierce richard carbon also astrophysicist two weeks before
[33:23.080 --> 33:28.280]  and we're first going to a call from david in japan two weeks and we have the abc news article
[33:28.280 --> 33:33.720]  erin's printing it right now we found it during the break from 2005 two weeks before the last
[33:33.720 --> 33:38.120]  supermoon that's when the moon is very close to the earth it's gonna be the closest it's been to
[33:38.120 --> 33:45.320]  the earth since 1992 that that there is a clear connection with the moon being closer to earth
[33:45.320 --> 33:51.240]  and tidal pole and super earthquakes and tsunamis we know the moon controls the tides anyways
[33:51.240 --> 33:58.040]  we've got a true astrophysicist who specializes in lunar research joining us here in a moment we
[33:58.040 --> 34:05.080]  also have a record solar flares uh hitting the earth abc news is now asking today did supermoon
[34:05.080 --> 34:10.040]  cause 8.9 earthquake in japan so they just beat us to the article we're writing at info wars dot
[34:10.040 --> 34:15.000]  com we'll talk to pierce carbon who's actually on a bus right now we caught him on a cell phone
[34:15.000 --> 34:20.520]  we'll talk to the astrophysicist here in a moment who's also a meteorologist but right now quickly
[34:20.520 --> 34:26.440]  david in japan james who just called in had to get to high ground with his son and uh barely
[34:26.440 --> 34:32.280]  got away from the tsunami where are you in japan what can you tell us david and i'm in
[34:32.280 --> 34:37.880]  osaka japan and i just wanted to say that on the local news reports we have here uh they're
[34:37.880 --> 34:43.480]  reporting a lot of casualties they're reporting at 10 by 10 and it's 30 people here 40 people there
[34:43.480 --> 34:48.120]  it looks like there's going to be extremely high casualties from the tsunami because it's uh
[34:48.120 --> 34:53.480]  it's not just like uh the earthquakes because japan generally is very well prepared has very good
[34:53.480 --> 35:00.280]  building codes uh in terms of earthquakes but there's just no preparing for the effect of the
[35:00.280 --> 35:07.560]  tsunami and luckily where i am here in osaka the um the effect of the tsunami wasn't too strong we
[35:07.560 --> 35:12.680]  were shielded but in total and up north there's been terrible casualties and they say in the
[35:12.680 --> 35:20.200]  time then died that there has to be between 200 and 300 fatalities there so uh it's probably
[35:20.200 --> 35:27.320]  going to go into the thousands i think absolutely uh just like in the indonesian situation that
[35:27.320 --> 35:33.720]  ended up killing over 200 000 for the first few hours we heard 100 200 300 it's now above 300 dead
[35:34.600 --> 35:39.480]  in japan i would imagine from the devastating footage we've seen all over that coastal area
[35:39.480 --> 35:47.560]  uh of uh japan where you just see hundreds of houses just being slammed like like like paper
[35:47.560 --> 35:56.360]  boats uh and factories and airports uh just just just just exploding into fire uh this is
[35:56.360 --> 36:02.280]  absolutely incredible we've got to be praying for everybody there i would guess that the death toll
[36:02.280 --> 36:06.760]  is probably going to be in the tens of thousands ladies and gentlemen anything else deba that you
[36:06.760 --> 36:12.760]  can add to us uh for us from japan yeah in in relation to the nuclear reactor that was what
[36:12.760 --> 36:17.160]  i wanted to bring you about the first reports that came out they said that they had uh there was
[36:17.160 --> 36:23.000]  an explosion in the coolant system and they weren't able to control a number one reactor actually that
[36:23.000 --> 36:29.160]  area where the in the Fukushima where the nuclear reactor is the six nuclear reactors on the site
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.440]  and they said they were able to shut down four number four to six and number two the coolant
[36:34.440 --> 36:39.000]  system turned on properly but number one they were not able to turn on the coolant system and
[36:39.640 --> 36:45.160]  they made a limit report about that and then afterwards they denied it and now where there's
[36:45.160 --> 36:51.000]  we're not sure what the situation is well i've got the latest uh on that again abc news uh
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.880]  Reuters as well pressure it damaged japanese nuclear reactor rising with fears that there's no coolant
[36:57.880 --> 37:06.120]  going in uh i mean this is very serious earthquake damage japanese nuclear reactor plant northeast
[37:06.120 --> 37:11.160]  of tokyo has stoked fears a radioactive fallout unless the reactor core can be cool and renewed
[37:11.160 --> 37:17.080]  concerned about the security of other nuclear facilities in the tsunami's path if it blows
[37:17.080 --> 37:24.120]  it could actually cause the other uh reactors to blow and as you said there's six there uh this is a
[37:24.120 --> 37:29.400]  gigantic facility japan of course it's most its power like france from the nukes and this is the
[37:29.400 --> 37:33.960]  problem with nukes folks i love technology but you know if i could have a cold powered plant
[37:33.960 --> 37:38.680]  that just puts out carbon dioxide and water vapor i'd rather have it than a nuke and texas has got
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.800]  a bunch of nukes in it uh and uh well thank you so much david anything else you'd like to add
[37:45.240 --> 37:49.880]  and no thanks alex we're listening here in japan and you're having a big impact so keep up the
[37:49.880 --> 37:55.880]  good work thanks a lot well thank you sir um folks we need to pray right now that that they get the
[37:55.880 --> 38:02.040]  coolant into that thing this is going to affect us too if it melts down and explodes it's going to
[38:02.040 --> 38:07.480]  eject incredibly radioactive isotopes right into the jet stream and they're going to orbit the earth
[38:07.480 --> 38:14.040]  for the next four billion years or so and uh chernobyl devastated you know thousands of square
[38:14.040 --> 38:20.920]  miles in its path this is devastating ladies and gentlemen uh anyway you slice it what is japan the
[38:20.920 --> 38:26.600]  earthquake prone capital of the world doing with literally hundreds of nuclear reactors look up
[38:26.600 --> 38:31.800]  how many reactors they've got i believe it's close to 100 uh all too often has two nuclear
[38:31.800 --> 38:37.560]  reactors in it giant research reactors up at the jj pickle facility and i tell the idiot public
[38:37.560 --> 38:43.160]  this thing laugh at me and by the way we're on a fault line here with three dormant volcanoes
[38:43.160 --> 38:48.040]  we're sitting on top of they're not extinct a lot of evidence shows okay i'm going to shut up now
[38:48.600 --> 38:55.160]  and go to our guest who joins us from the uh roads there uh in england uh he's on the road peers
[38:55.160 --> 39:01.480]  richard carbon meteorologist astrophysicist consultant owner of weather action and he's
[39:01.480 --> 39:09.640]  hailed by cnn fox bbc uh as the only guy who can predict with over 90 accuracy some say 86
[39:09.640 --> 39:15.160]  percent accuracy a year out what's going to happen they got 55 operating the supply of power in a
[39:15.160 --> 39:21.880]  bunch of other research facilities uh 52 light water 55 overall uh mr corbin uh again what is
[39:21.880 --> 39:29.000]  your accuracy a year out i forget the exact number and give us your view uh on abc and other saying
[39:29.000 --> 39:37.080]  that did supermoon cause 8.9 earthquake in japan what is a supermoon sir uh right well our accuracy
[39:37.080 --> 39:44.680]  rate is uh 85 percent for extreme events forecasted many months ahead and that's based on a combination
[39:44.680 --> 39:55.240]  of solar and lunar uh effects um a supermoon is when the moon is closest to the earth and there's
[39:55.240 --> 40:03.320]  also it's so full on you but basically that that type of that situation gives you the strongest um
[40:03.320 --> 40:12.840]  um tidal effect um now the idea that the supermoon helps trigger earthquakes is absolutely correct
[40:12.840 --> 40:22.040]  we we agree with that and we know there is a lunar signal in um earthquake data uh but we also know
[40:22.040 --> 40:29.880]  that to actually trigger an earthquake it seems very helpful you might say if there is also
[40:29.880 --> 40:37.880]  uh major activity on the sun just proceeding the moment where there will be some lunar effects
[40:37.880 --> 40:49.400]  in terms of toys and by the way uh doctor i'm sorry i interrupted you sir i interrupted you
[40:49.400 --> 40:52.840]  because there's a little bit of time delay uh repeat that you're saying if there's lunar
[40:52.840 --> 40:57.720]  and solar together that you know there's evidence uh and that we that's right we did have both
[40:57.720 --> 41:04.600]  yesterday please repeat it in detail yes what you need to get a big earthquake is a combination
[41:04.600 --> 41:12.600]  of a lunar and solar effect you need uh big events on the sun and then events those events
[41:12.600 --> 41:18.280]  affect the solar wind and you need to solve the wind uh coronal mass ejections to be directed to
[41:18.280 --> 41:24.600]  earth and yesterday earth was hit by a coronal mass ejection and at the same time it helped
[41:24.600 --> 41:31.880]  if you've also got uh extra lunar tidal effects on the earth crust and that's what we got right
[41:31.880 --> 41:40.120]  now so uh or nor near back so um that gives us what we what we're seeing well sir as a leading
[41:40.120 --> 41:48.440]  meteorologist and astrophysicist who specializes in lunar and solar study um there's a big debate
[41:48.440 --> 41:55.800]  raging right now we discover magazine abc says did supermoon cause 8.9 they're reporting this is
[41:55.800 --> 42:03.880]  the biggest supermoon since 1992 a is that correct from your research and and i mean and and some
[42:03.880 --> 42:09.320]  people yeah well it probably is correct but but you know you actually get quite a lot of lunar
[42:09.320 --> 42:16.360]  effects i mean the moon is closest to the earth once uh the world once every month so he's then
[42:16.360 --> 42:22.200]  got out of other things for the moon as well as i said a new moon or a full moon so when they say
[42:22.200 --> 42:26.840]  the biggest for a long time they're also talking about the plane of the moon's orbit and uh and
[42:26.840 --> 42:35.000]  so forth which is a bit near and eclipse um so i think the details of how big isn't that important
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.960]  just as long as you've got a significant moon and uh an extra hit from from the sun because you
[42:41.960 --> 42:46.760]  have quite a few things which are waiting to happen all the time and it needs a trigger and if
[42:46.760 --> 42:52.120]  it triggers above a certain level then they will come and and the combination of lunar and solar
[42:52.120 --> 42:58.040]  effect will give them so the two magnify each other that's right definitely definitely how do
[42:58.040 --> 43:04.040]  the how does the solar coronal ejection several as you said in the last week hitting a big one
[43:04.040 --> 43:13.800]  hitting yesterday how how does how does the lunar radiation and winds affect the tectonic
[43:13.800 --> 43:20.600]  activities right well we don't understand the details of how it all works but we do know that
[43:20.600 --> 43:26.520]  when you get a coronal ejection hitting earth that there is a lot of geomagnetic activity
[43:26.520 --> 43:31.960]  that is the magnetic field of the earth goes a bit wild now that is connected to the earth
[43:31.960 --> 43:40.840]  being down so uh you know changes in that does involve forces and uh uh that could encourage
[43:40.840 --> 43:46.520]  or tip the balance which allows the tectonic plate to move that little bit but it uh he's
[43:46.520 --> 43:51.560]  trying to go anyway so all we know is that throughout history there have been even the
[43:51.560 --> 43:57.320]  ancients obviously knew this they didn't know why that the moon and the sun do tend to affect
[43:57.320 --> 44:06.040]  volcanoes and things like that uh and uh i mean obviously uh i mean if the moon itself is what
[44:06.040 --> 44:11.480]  creates the tides uh coming in and out then then certainly the sun is going to have an effect
[44:11.480 --> 44:19.640]  but the u n said um about a year and a half ago at the uh copenhagen summit uh they they
[44:19.640 --> 44:26.120]  they said the sun has no effect on climate well they would the trouble is the whole of science
[44:26.120 --> 44:33.160]  has been been corrupted by these to two nonsense um but before waiting any more time on that i
[44:33.160 --> 44:38.440]  would just like to say a very interesting thing about the solar effect is that the biggest
[44:38.440 --> 44:45.480]  storms and the biggest earthquake tend to come curiously uh when the solar activity on average
[44:45.480 --> 44:51.720]  is low like it's in solar minima especially the order to even minima like we're now in moving
[44:51.720 --> 44:58.040]  into or in cycle 24 without a documentary we happen in those periods when there is also
[44:58.680 --> 45:04.600]  so that's kind of quiet and then you've got extra big events within that time and those
[45:04.600 --> 45:09.640]  those are the events which seem to trigger earthquakes more but when you've got more solar
[45:09.640 --> 45:16.920]  activity you seem to get uh a lot of littler smaller earthquakes rather than single big ones
[45:16.920 --> 45:23.160]  which seem to happen around the solar minima uh especially or to even minima which is all
[45:23.160 --> 45:29.480]  quite interesting and it's kind of understandable when you think about uh you know shaking of rocks
[45:29.480 --> 45:37.400]  or shaking sugar out of a jar and so on you know uh it'll stick uh and then come out in lumps and
[45:38.440 --> 45:42.200]  except when you have lots of little wobbles then it doesn't come out in lumps well sir
[45:42.200 --> 45:47.560]  you know that's part of another to help us understand that anyway yes sir we're talking to meteorologist
[45:47.560 --> 45:54.040]  and astrophysicist pierce richard uh corbin you can check out his very uh important website
[45:54.040 --> 46:01.080]  at weatheraction.com but but sir i specifically brought up the un because oh yes uh as you know
[46:01.080 --> 46:08.040]  with the earthquake uh in haiti and some of the other earthquakes algore and others have come out
[46:08.040 --> 46:13.880]  the un has come out and they have said that the earthquake is caused by global warming when
[46:14.440 --> 46:20.600]  from my research but correct me if i'm wrong there's really no evidence uh connecting co2 in in the
[46:20.600 --> 46:27.720]  you know a slow average to any type of a big event but we do have direct connections to to solar
[46:27.720 --> 46:32.520]  and lunar events so they're telling us the sun has no effect so they can blame it all on humans and
[46:32.520 --> 46:39.240]  taxes well that's right they are mad they are fools they are charlatans they're liars and uh if you
[46:39.240 --> 46:45.480]  want to know more pop on our website where we put up uh a thing at weatheraction.com on this
[46:45.480 --> 46:53.320]  very point under uh labor under comments from me the most recent comment from me on weatheraction.com
[46:54.840 --> 47:00.200]  absolutely uh in closing sir and obviously you go over the science you go over the math
[47:00.200 --> 47:05.880]  uh 85 percent uh accuracy in your in your catastrophic predictions i've seen the press
[47:05.880 --> 47:11.480]  report above 90 in in uh some of the closer in predictions not just a year out the proof is in
[47:11.480 --> 47:17.000]  the pudding in the last two years well no no it's just the no i mean no bragg just fact sir i mean
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.760]  you obviously know what you're talking about but you know you say it's more of an art form
[47:21.320 --> 47:27.080]  looking at the history and then projecting forward almost to dead reckoning dead reckoning
[47:27.080 --> 47:34.360]  with the big record solar flare the uh the the uh you know the huge moon uh the super moon
[47:34.360 --> 47:40.120]  what does your gut tell you i mean does your gut tell you doctor that that this this was probably
[47:40.120 --> 47:47.560]  triggered uh or pushed over the edge by the super moon and the coronal mass ejection yes yes we
[47:47.560 --> 47:53.560]  would say that we say this thing was caused by events on the sun or a solar a solar lunar
[47:53.560 --> 47:59.640]  combination and i put out the treat to that effect with the link and uh my tweet addresses
[47:59.640 --> 48:07.320]  payers underscore corbin spelt to ym so if anyone goes on there they can get all the links
[48:07.320 --> 48:13.720]  straight away well sir we'll follow you hopefully you'll follow us at twitter.com forward slash real
[48:13.720 --> 48:18.600]  alex jones we're just now getting on the uh twitter bandwagon to reach folks because it's so
[48:18.600 --> 48:23.160]  effective uh well sir we'll talk to you again in the in the very near future anything else that
[48:23.160 --> 48:30.280]  you'd like to add no that's fine it's too proud to uh come on your your your show good to have you
[48:30.280 --> 48:37.560]  doctor okay there goes meteorologist and astrophysicist doctor of astrophysics uh physics uh by the way
[48:37.560 --> 48:44.920]  that guy's literally about 180 IQ so we appreciate him uh joining us uh and you heard him just complete
[48:44.920 --> 48:52.280]  fraud complete scam complete joke and look for uh danny glover look for al gore look for the un
[48:52.280 --> 48:58.520]  bachari to now say this was global warming was it global warming 800 years ago in japan when they
[48:58.520 --> 49:05.400]  had earthquakes and tsunamis no it was the sun and the moon mm-hmm yeah there's a gigantic
[49:05.400 --> 49:11.080]  planetoid spinning around us it controls the uh weather just give you a little newsflash with
[49:11.080 --> 49:19.640]  the sun it's a 100 fact and they sit there like the vatican 500 600 years ago telling you still
[49:19.640 --> 49:26.280]  that the earth was a center of the universe okay this is as ridiculous or more to have the united
[49:26.280 --> 49:33.960]  nations in 2011 telling us that the sun and the moon do not affect climate that it's all us
[49:35.160 --> 49:41.320]  baloney baloney oh they're worried about those cold power plants they want to shut down
[49:41.320 --> 49:45.400]  so they can build their nuclear plants because then only insiders can get the permits
[49:45.400 --> 49:52.440]  that's like general electric i don't want nuclear plants i'm not against it if it's all we had use
[49:52.440 --> 49:58.920]  it but it is on the last of my list if you want to have deep space spacecraft going out of orbit
[49:58.920 --> 50:04.920]  with it still dangerous to get it up into orbit but if they had some safe way to do it nuke makes a
[50:04.920 --> 50:14.360]  lot of sense in orbit or out of orbit um i i i aircraft carriers they have a safer history
[50:14.360 --> 50:20.520]  with smaller ones uh and at least it's out in the ocean uh subs we know there's been a bunch of
[50:20.520 --> 50:25.240]  disasters they cover up we know this universities have radiation detectors all over the world
[50:25.240 --> 50:29.160]  and we know that radiation just goes up and up and up and there's all sorts of leaks
[50:29.160 --> 50:35.320]  and all sorts of cover-ups and storing the waste i'm done i'm done i'm done they're talking about
[50:35.320 --> 50:45.160]  this uh this reactor blowing up we the the temperature is rising they can't get cooling
[50:45.160 --> 50:51.320]  into it it's one of six reactors at the same facility it melts down ladies and gentlemen
[50:52.040 --> 50:58.200]  you think large areas of japan on fire right now is bad pray pray pray that the coolant gets
[50:58.200 --> 51:05.320]  into that reactor we all know that berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name

[52:39.160 --> 52:43.960]  mall owner general growth properties in fact baron's called his work a dire prophecy if you
[52:43.960 --> 52:48.440]  haven't taken time to watch this free video do it right now you may never think about america

[54:28.280 --> 54:40.840]  i'm on every night but now i might be okay we have twitter intel flooding in at twitter.com forward
[54:40.840 --> 54:46.200]  slash real alex jones you know we got a twitter account nine ten months ago we actually have three
[54:46.200 --> 54:51.320]  or four of them a total of about eighty ninety thousand all together and we just kind of use it
[54:51.320 --> 54:56.840]  as a news feed to get the word out but really it's designed for you the listeners to give us intel
[54:56.840 --> 55:02.920]  to give us heads up i'm trying to twitter every day you know not just lean over matt ryan shoulder
[55:02.920 --> 55:06.680]  and say hey send a photo out to folks or tell them this is coming up you know i'm actually
[55:06.680 --> 55:11.320]  you know twittering to you myself we're sending more and more things out but really that's just
[55:11.320 --> 55:15.960]  so folks are interested in it so we can get the information from you when things are happening
[55:15.960 --> 55:21.800]  or when i'm at a demonstration and the cops are beating people up i can send it out to a hundred
[55:21.800 --> 55:26.760]  two hundred three hundred thousand people hey we're here we need help that's why i want to get
[55:26.760 --> 55:31.160]  this one twitter account up to a hundred thousand i need to be a hundred thousand to have any real
[55:31.160 --> 55:36.920]  punch we've dominated youtube dominated google three hundred million views on youtube uh we've
[55:36.920 --> 55:42.120]  dominated uh you know so many other areas but we've not even i mean i'm the one that got charlie
[55:42.120 --> 55:46.440]  sheen to do his twitter account i'm the guy that twisted his arm and said communicate directly
[55:46.440 --> 55:53.240]  don't communicate through text to tmz who then censors what you're doing and what you're saying
[55:53.240 --> 56:00.840]  uh if you can get through from uh japan it's twitter.com forward slash real alex jones
[56:00.840 --> 56:11.960]  you can call us at 800-259-9231-800-259-9231 i was going to have pharmacist ben fuchs back on
[56:11.960 --> 56:18.600]  talking about health and how our soils are almost completely depleted and how so many illnesses and
[56:18.600 --> 56:23.320]  the fact that you're always hungry want more is reading empty calories is because so much of the
[56:23.320 --> 56:28.840]  food has had the real minerals removed in it because the soil is dead and i already canceled him once
[56:28.840 --> 56:33.160]  a few weeks ago because the charlie sheen thing had blown up then and i don't want to do it again
[56:33.160 --> 56:37.800]  today so he'll be he'll be on this about 30 minutes in the next hour but he'll also give us his take
[56:37.800 --> 56:42.840]  on the situation with the earthquake and the tsunami and the 8.9 and the reactor on the verge of
[56:42.840 --> 56:55.480]  melting down and just all of this uh insanity but if you are in japan 800-259-9231-800-259-9231
[56:55.480 --> 57:02.200]  and we will uh get you up and on the air if you have trouble calling a 1-800 number
[57:05.160 --> 57:10.920]  john give me a genesis uh can i put a genesis regular number out do we have one of those
[57:10.920 --> 57:15.960]  that's available only because my regular call guy is working on some my t stuff in another
[57:15.960 --> 57:19.800]  department today we can probably drag them in here and i can give out our number our local
[57:19.800 --> 57:25.400]  number because sometimes people can't call foreign into a 1-800 number uh harman up a
[57:25.400 --> 57:31.800]  genesis do you have a regular number i can give out for okay well just give it to me verbally
[57:31.800 --> 57:33.400]  then and i'll just give it out on air right now
[57:33.400 --> 57:40.120]  well send it to me on iam just to make sure i'm right yeah yeah that uh
[57:41.720 --> 57:46.680]  now here's the type of stuff we're getting from japan at twitter.com real alec jones
[57:46.680 --> 57:52.920]  excellent thanks for the heads up i just uh ordered an autograph copy and a couple of
[57:52.920 --> 57:57.560]  t-shirts while i was at it oh that was a twitter that's the wrong stack i was just giving a stack
[57:57.560 --> 58:03.240]  earlier of twitter comments from japan so i don't know why that one's there um
[58:05.800 --> 58:11.240]  we just got in a bunch of autographed jesse ventura books 45 of them and then and then that's
[58:11.240 --> 58:15.960]  it if you want them uh and and i also autographed them there's a photo up on twitter of me
[58:15.960 --> 58:21.400]  autographing the jesse ventura autograph 63 documents the government doesn't want you to have
[58:21.960 --> 58:27.080]  but here it is but i'll get all those twitters i'll find those twitters from the
[58:27.080 --> 58:36.120]  tsunami victim uh folks out there and the reactor situation let me compose myself refocus

[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.920]  a speech right now saying that that that they're going to go ahead with a humanitarian cover uh
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:52.120]  and invade uh through nato um libya ron paul's calling in an act of war well what do you think
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:57.880]  blockades and invasions are it's like last week uh i guess on monday now not even last week uh
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:04.440]  senator carrey's saying well you know uh we need to bomb their airfields and do a blockade and
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.880]  but we don't need to have any invasion or any act of war or any military action now there there
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:17.560]  it is ap obama says us is tightening news on libyan leader president barack obama said friday that a
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:22.680]  no flies down over libya to get colonel moomar qaddafi from attacking rebels remains a possibility
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:27.240]  and we were slowly tightening the news around qaddafi really is qaddafi won a bunch of battles today
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:33.960]  but he stopped short of uh moving toward military action the bottom line is i have not taken any
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:38.040]  actions off the table at this point obama told white house news conference yeah they'd rather
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:42.680]  have the rebels they have back to get control instead of having to have another war but they're
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:47.400]  certainly happy to have it now and again that's going on the dollar is moving towards being
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:52.680]  depegged right now with the chinese attacking at the g20 attacking it the biggest bond investment
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:58.200]  fund in the world saying they're not buying dollars anymore just devastating you got the tsunami
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.200]  earthquake eight point nine biggest in the in the hundred plus years they've been recording
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:08.280]  richter scale activity in that area of the pacific they're now reporting over a thousand dead and
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.200]  it's going to be ten thousand and then twenty thousand i mean this is super bad news and when
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.800]  you see whole areas of cities with houses and buildings just being pushed by giant waves people
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:25.560]  are being crushed and cut up in their folks i mean this is this is devastating and japan is so dense
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:32.200]  they're so densely populated in the areas where they allow development uh that there's a lot of
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:37.400]  people they're dying i mean when you're watching those hard videos and here's the biggest news
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.160]  here's the biggest news right now and i'm going to japan and your phone calls shelled in and others
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:54.600]  um pressure at damaged japanese nuclear reactor rising with fears so the pressure is rising they
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.720]  got six nukes at that one facility they're all huge the number one reactor the others are malfunctioning
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:06.680]  but still up and cooling uh under the japanese law they've got to issue an emergency when one
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:12.200]  isn't cooling because the temperature will rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and then
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:17.720]  the rods will set on fire and then they will burn out of their their their casings and they will
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:24.280]  plunge into the floor and they will melt through the concrete and then they will explode and then
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:31.400]  they will shoot radiation into the atmosphere with with nuclear fallout and you better believe when
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.440]  the plant blows up it's probably going to make the other ones explode and i was looking at photos
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:43.800]  and video of giant oil facilities on fire and huge gas tanks blowing up i mean japan might as
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:48.600]  well have godzilla stomping around right now swinging his tail in the buildings i mean godzilla
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:55.960]  couldn't do this in an hour i mean this is devastating look at it i got i got it on screen
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:04.920]  right now refineries just on fire i mean this is absolutely crazy man this is off the charts right
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:10.120]  now and so many americans are giggling and laughing about it like it's a spectator sport
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:16.200]  disconnected from reality and i'm not even saying those poor people are bad folks it's just that
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:23.800]  we've been so disconnected that that the people have lost their empathy to a certain extent where i
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:29.160]  guarantee americans are out there right now and i've already seen some evidence of it just kind of
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:35.240]  looking at this in awe like it's a spectacle and i guess you can't judge them in a way it is
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:41.000]  uh i mean i saw a lot of new yorkers even the day of 9-11 who weren't actually hurt in it
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.240]  kind of smiling and laughing and excited and like it was a football game or something
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.680]  but i'm thinking about all the people in there dying all the babies little kids right now trapped
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.320]  squealing for their mommy mommy's trapped under rubble a few feet away watching their baby bleed
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.360]  to death right now i mean i'm envisioning and mapping what's going on in there and i got kids
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.480]  and it's freaking me out so i'm actually feel like i'm about to throw up thinking about it because i
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:11.240]  have system spectrum analysis understanding it's not even hard you know i told charlie sheen i'm
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:16.840]  going to your calls just three days ago i said this is what's gonna happen i said a crazy person
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.680]  isn't gonna make it through that front gate up there in the security guards in your neighborhood
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:26.920]  one of the most elite and Beverly Hills i said i have envisioned somebody's gonna come through
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:34.840]  the back climb up the uh probably thousand foot brush hill with the gps and come over your back
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:40.680]  fence that happened last night i said i envision all these people you let in your house who watch
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:48.520]  television they're they've they've been pre-programmed i said i'm not bragging folks this is my
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.320]  understanding this is really common sense i said you got that sharps rifle framed on the wall from
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:59.960]  a movie it's a plugged movie replica and it's got some fake sharps rifle shells you've got people
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:05.320]  that watch tv where it's set in dramas based in new york where they find a gun in somebody's house
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:10.120]  and they go to jail for it i go people call the police on veterans all the time because they see
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.640]  him putting a gun in their car to go deer hunting i said you're not supposed to have guns because
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.560]  this restraining order and he goes we don't have guns and i said i know but i said you're going to
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:23.160]  have a some control freak in your house who thinks you could have a toy gun they'll call the cops i
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.800]  said so that's going to happen you're going to start having people climbing over the the fence
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.680]  and the gates because you're the number one new story in the world right now he's still is bigger
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:37.400]  bigger than the tsunami shouldn't be he thinks it's sick and is making jokes about it you know
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:42.680]  about about the fact that he's bigger than the qaddafi thing right now uh so charlie thinks it's
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:49.000]  crazy he says why are the fluoride heads into this um i told him that was going to happen i told him
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  they'd start trying to commit him that's now starting and he's not crazy he's wound up angry
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.480]  drinking a lot of coffee off drugs so he's bouncing off the walls he's a little manic but that's not
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:04.360]  crazy you know they call little boys raising their hands too much and wanting to wrestle on the
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:11.000]  playground mental illness now they've got dozens and dozens of mentally uh mental illness designations
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.680]  if you don't trust authority and government i mean thomas jefferson would have been locked up
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.240]  but the point is i don't just know how to analyze what's happening geopolitically i can analyze
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:26.760]  people individually by the way any of you could do this if you were tuned into reality here okay
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.840]  let's go to sheldon in japan i'm gonna go to some twitter questions uh but let's just pray this
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:38.120]  reactor doesn't melt down and then a chain reaction six reactors could go off i mean let's pray and
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:45.160]  don't think prayer doesn't have an effect now it could be god's will they don't think they're in
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:51.080]  divine providence that god can work through people to throw themselves into the equipment to you know
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:56.920]  to give them the understanding to get that those emergency pumps working this coastal plant got
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:03.320]  hit by a tsunami again a country that has giant earthquakes giant tsunamis you know the old timers
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.040]  they're built their houses out of paper because of this because they didn't like them falling on them
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:12.040]  that's the big cause of death uh what a building code you know they figured it out and you got a
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:20.440]  big concrete steel containment unit on the coastline most of the reactors are on the coast
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.600]  does that make sense they got a level four bioweapons lab
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:34.760]  uh in a level two containment that just means glass doors uh in
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:44.360]  galveston texas where hurricane said i mean you know it's just but then the government's got to
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.240]  stick their hands down my pants because a terrorist might blow up an airplane you got a better chance
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.320]  being struck by lightning or dying by a bee sting but i gotta give up all my freedom so federal
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:58.920]  goons has nothing to do with it it's a federal takeover uh u.s delivers coolant to japanese nuclear
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.800]  power plant and i'm going to the japan call here i'm gonna skip this break but but uh
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:10.200]  put the other article you just had up about u.s military standing by that's important too
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:16.040]  let's go to sheldon in japan sheldon sorry i'm ranting where are you in japan sheldon what are you
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:24.520]  saying i'm actually in Osaka japan the same as james which is kind of far from the epicenter
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:31.320]  it's like about the distance from san francisco to a los angeles to print the context but uh you
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:39.080]  know i was here at about 240 like it's 246 p.m and you know my whole apartment to start shaking
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:44.520]  on the third floor here and even though i'm that far away was still basically the most powerful
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.760]  earthquake i've felt since i've been here i've been in are you north or south of tokyo
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.080]  i'm south of it i'm in the western part of japan which way is the wind blowing this season
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.760]  uh this the season i well basically usually comes over the mountains comes down south in
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:09.480]  osaka anyways so you are south of tokyo so you're you're gonna be in the fallout zone if that if
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:16.360]  that reactor blows up are you concerned about that yeah you know it'll be concerned basically but
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.920]  i mean i'm kind of desensitized to it all because of all the uh basically just the
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:26.520]  constant onslaught of all all the materials we have in the sky the chemtrails all well let me
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.560]  tell you this is going to be this is going to be uranium and high powered uh i'm trying to
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:38.520]  scare you but do you have potassium iodate um no i do not believe i do no we haven't had that
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:43.800]  sponsor in years we should i've got all every medicine cabinet my house has got it if there's a
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:48.200]  now i don't want to give medical advice out and get people sick here but you need to look up
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.440]  alternatives to potassium iodate there are a few other things you can usually find at a drugstore
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.280]  quickly that are in the iodine family but i i don't i don't remember the specifics so i'm
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.520]  going to get into it in an emergency to fill your thyroid because see what happens is if you
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:07.960]  absorb that uranium 236 238 and other isotopes because when it melts down it mixes with things
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:11.160]  in the surrounding environment and throws off all sorts of horrible
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:22.040]  miscreant variants of it you got to fill your thyroid ahead of of the radiation hitting you
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.680]  and and and again are they on the news they're telling people to get to government emergency
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:34.200]  facilities handing out uh the potassium iodate no not really no like in this part of the country
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.280]  they're not really doing much other than you know they're playing it on every news channel
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:44.360]  but they're not really there's no like feeling of uh you know fear basically you know so in a
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.920]  nuclear powered country we're just going around it in a nuclear powered country they don't tell
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:58.920]  her by the potassium iodine um no not at all they don't tell anything basically yeah i mean
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:06.440]  here the culture is really kind of um you know just be quiet and don't don't cause any trouble
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:12.520]  you know that's really the culture of japan so there's not no um if we in japan they have a
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.920]  saying don't be the nail that sticks out because that's the first one to get hit so everybody
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:22.040]  just kind of just you know doesn't they're told yeah i have a saying every nail should stick out
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:30.040]  and then they can never hammer us all in yeah for sure well listen uh sheldon i appreciate you
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:38.600]  calling uh so you're south of the uh fallout right now that blows um boy let me tell you that is not
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:47.400]  a good thing well do you do you have a gas mask no no i do not have a gas mask now all i have
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:52.600]  basically when the earthquake actually hit you know all i was thinking was to grab my gold because
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:56.440]  i have i you know bought some gold here i want to actually just have that on me in case i had to
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:01.880]  run from the apartment because it was actually at that moment that it was it was strong enough
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:07.000]  that i'm not trying to scare you i'm not trying to scare you but if that reactor melts down everybody's
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.520]  going to start running if i was you i would study the winds i'd get online pull up the uh you know
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:17.160]  they'll have the exact winds right now what they're forecast for in the next week and then i would make
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:23.080]  a decision uh to go uh not north because it might blow then you'll be in the in the way of the tsunami
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.120]  but you know whichever way the winds probably aren't going or behind the mountain range
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:33.400]  you know wherever you can go away from those winds just as a precaution buddy and of course
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:37.000]  again one if it actually blows everybody's gonna they're gonna then if they're gonna tell folks
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:43.320]  the shelter in place but people still run if i was you i know there's a mountain range up the middle
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:47.960]  i would try to study those winds and get on the other side of the mountain range or go further
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:51.720]  south or down to the tip because it'll probably go south and then i'm looking at some of the
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:57.720]  wind charts right now and go out to sea if i was you i'd be i would be as on a bullet train
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:06.200]  going south and then to the west again just as a precaution sir if i was you i would be getting
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:15.080]  out of dodge so fast it'd make people's head spin sheldon yeah i hear you again it may not melt down
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.840]  we pray it doesn't melt down but you know what's going to happen if that reactor melts down and
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:23.400]  blow you understand it's going to explode and shoot radiation into the air and i mean it's
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:28.120]  literally killed tens of thousands of people with complications in the last 20 years since chair noble
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:32.360]  i mean you do not want to be radiated by this buddy you think chemtrails aluminum
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:36.920]  dioxide is bad you this is nothing compared to a high-powered dose of radiation
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.960]  yeah for sure i'm worried that way you can kind of cover it up basically because
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:47.640]  you know exactly it could it could blow up and they won't even tell you exactly i'm telling you
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:52.600]  i'm telling you study the trade winds right now pick a spot and get out of dodge right now sheldon
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:23:01.720]  all right thank you and of course the media will be like elix jones told japanese to get
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:09.000]  out of the fallout zone of course it might melt down and do the china syndrome like chair noble
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:14.600]  but again you need to just we recommend you go outside and breathe deeply and don't take
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:24.120]  potassium iodate that's alcada as well i can't handle it anymore josh in california that's in
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:33.320]  the path of tsunami waves that haven't hit yet we know pardon me oh he just dropped again for
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:39.960]  those that don't know but some tsunami waves did hit the pacific island of hawaii of the the hawaian
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:46.840]  islands to be technical the chain and they're ordering people in several towns to evacuate
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:54.040]  in origan that are lowline close to sea level and beautiful pacific northwest and quite frankly
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:58.760]  the only thing that really matters right now is that they're talking about this reactor melting
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:03.800]  down will continue to go over that uh the temperature is rising as of an hour ago
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:10.440]  and uh they're they're telling people this this is abc reuters you name it
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:18.040]  the media will play on people's ignorance like 10 years from now and say jones once said a reactor
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:25.400]  may melt down in japan it was made up there was no reactor japan doesn't exist like the time abc news
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:31.640]  reported russia had fired an icbm at us i ran in and set it on air because it was on abc news
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.880]  and then a month later nobody remembered it and people said alex said they fired an icbm
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:41.000]  i didn't say that abc news said that and they came out said oh it was just a test missile no big deal
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.080]  and then china fires a missile off the coast even pentagon officials blew the whistle on that and
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:51.160]  they still say it was a chem trail and then people call me and say you claim a missile was fired off
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.960]  the coast no i said my guests said that and people in the pentagon and the former head of nasa said
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:01.560]  it was a missile trail you know that's how mainstream media spends things i i tell the uh rolling stone
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:06.440]  that i smoked pot a little but didn't like it and it turns into alex then quit smoking pot
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:11.800]  like i was some kind of pothead but it doesn't matter everybody knows this is happening in japan
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.560]  and people will probably remember any year when the media takes it out of context and
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:20.440]  they'll probably say that i said godzilla was real you know because i was talking about japanese
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.880]  art types of worrying about disaster because their country's so prone to it you know it's kind of like
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:32.280]  charlie sheen uh so much of what i talked to him about he adopts because he likes me but then i kind
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:38.040]  of with har watch it because folks when he's joking around about vatican assassin warlocks it was all
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:43.800]  just because people said that we were reptoid vatican assassin warlocks and now people really
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:50.040]  believe we're vatican assassin reptoid warlocks but um i don't believe that zilla's real folks and
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:57.800]  charlie sheen's joking about vatican assassin warlocks and um people just can't get it they just
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:04.120]  really really can't get it and won't get it and i've got a headache and a stomach ache uh watching
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:10.280]  all this happen um we've got pharmacist ben fuchs coming up after the break and we're going to shift
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:15.320]  gears for 30 minutes on things you can do to protect yourself and he's a pharmacist oh my gosh i can
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:22.360]  ask him i can search it online i just know that regular types of iodine like the military gifts
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:27.400]  troops and their emergency kits and fighter pilots and others uh in case they're shot down
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.000]  a nuclear fallout make you throw up and get sick uh there's the potassium iodate pills that are
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.480]  softened that i have and that we've promoted in the past we don't have a sponsor for that right now
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.720]  we should uh it's really cheap i guess we don't have a sponsor because it's so cheap they never make
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:50.040]  the money to advertise people get it they get it um and uh so i can ask him about if people
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:56.760]  don't listen don't get potassium iodate a reactor blows up uh one of the types of iodine you can take
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:03.560]  to fill your thyroid to see what happens is the number one cause of death a nuclear fallout
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.800]  is in fast growing cells and glands i know this because i've researched it we'll talk to
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.600]  pharmacist ben fuchs about it when we come back and what happens is your
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:19.400]  thyroid particularly regulates much of the body's metabolic system that's not debated
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.840]  and in fallout the teeth fall out you get bleeding in the intestines but they're tough the the guts
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.840]  can come back and you can survive your teeth falling out uh and again fast growing cells in
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:36.200]  the intestines they all shed it's it's one of the most painful things reportedly bloody diarrhea
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:41.880]  for weeks but if you survive that the one thing you won't survive is your thyroid it will uptake
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:49.160]  and suck up the radioactive isotopes if it's not full iodine that's the thing that is a blocker
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:58.920]  and it will die inside your head inside your throat and you will die you will die it will rot
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:04.440]  you will die you will die if you get a moderate dose of uranium and the different isotopes
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.480]  and if your thyroid isn't filled now that's u.s. army standard issue of course they hate the trip
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.560]  so much they give them a toxic form of it that uh makes them vomit and throw up but it's better than
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:18.760]  dying uh there is the potassium iodate brands out there that make you a little sick but you
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:24.280]  upload it quicker and uh we'll talk about that and look i don't live in fear it's the opposite i
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:29.320]  got firearms i got a three-year supply of food for my whole family i got a water well i've moved out
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:35.400]  in the country i've got all this not because i live in fear but because i know the world's an
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:41.400]  uncertain crazy place and people will never believe they're going to get mugged or raped or
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:47.160]  earthquake or tsunami or that a black widow's going to bite them and kill them or that they're
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.600]  going to die in a car wreck number one cause of death's car wreck people are not afraid of it
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:58.760]  they drive around like maniacs but they're so afraid of arabs you got a better chance of dying
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:04.760]  a honeybee sting bolt alighting it's something like 24 times in the world all the neck better chance
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:12.600]  of dying drowning you know drowned uh you pull those numbers up but but but it's not you know
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:17.560]  scary to die in the water i guess or to die from a bee sting or in a car wreck though that's pretty
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:26.120]  scary way to die any one of those no it's something about a man in a in a in a in a nightgown or
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:32.200]  whatever they wear and a big beard it's fun to get into the fear and oh i love trips with machine
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:36.120]  guns and german shepherds and body scanners that's what you're supposed to be scared of
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:41.560]  that's what's always dangerous the government see i see that and i'm like whoa danger will
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:46.040]  robinson government killed hundreds of millions of people last century it's getting a good start
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:51.320]  right now in this century pharmacist ben fuchs coming up more on the earthquakes everything else

[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:07.960]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:13.240]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:18.760]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:24.040]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:29.320]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:34.440]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:39.000]  lose their power from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.560]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:47.800]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:53.560]  at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:33:06.360]  doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:15.160]  you take a model man and put them in control
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:22.280]  okay we are back live we'll continue with the latest on the nuclear reactor
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:32.280]  that is in danger of melting down via a Chernobyl slash china syndrome in japan the huge tsunami the
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:41.880]  record in modern history recorded earthquake 8.9 uh ladies and gentlemen a 10 is in the world type
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:47.880]  stuff because it doubles each level up it i mean we're talking lava shooting 10 000 feet in the air
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:55.800]  i mean an eight an 8.9 is is so devastating it it it's it's well it's the record in the last 100
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:04.200]  years of recorded seismographs with a seismologist out there uh so this is just incredible but
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:09.000]  pharmacist ben fuchs joins us he's a gcn host sunday's he's about to be on the hour before i
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:17.960]  am every day weekdays uh talk show host uh and uh ben fuchs uh also um again host the bright side
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:23.320]  he's a featured nutritional and wellness information uh researcher he's also a
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:29.800]  degreed uh pharmacist of many years until he discovered what the synthetic drugs were actually
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:37.320]  doing and how they're designed to treat the symptoms and not the cause and he's also involved
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.640]  with myself with young jevity and really trying to get people back into minerals back into nutrients
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:50.680]  and the super high quality products that are provided there at info wars team dot com but
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.320]  ben you've been on hold and i appreciate you joining us i'm sorry every time i have you
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:00.200]  schedule some big emergency comes up but but you heard my question about the thyroid and
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:05.880]  potassium iodate and things that people can use during fallout to protect their thyroid can you
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:10.600]  break that down for us sure thank you thank you very much alice for having me on it's a pleasure
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:16.200]  to be here uh the thyroid gland is your body's main metabolic gland and it's a vacuum cleaner for
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:21.000]  iodine it sucks up iodine the way your Hoover vacuum cleaner sucks up the dirt off your carpet
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.200]  because iodine is incredibly important for thyroid functioning one of the effects of
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:32.360]  nuclear reactor disasters is uh the spewing out of radioactive iodine and because the
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:37.560]  thyroid gland is so efficient at sucking up iodine if there is no regular iodine present and this
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.880]  has a lot of implications to play in thyroid health gets that second if there's no iodine present it
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:48.600]  will take up the radioactive iodine instead and thus irradiating the thyroid that's why it's important
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:54.760]  to have iodine present in the body so the thyroid will not take in the radioactive iodine now if
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:00.680]  there's a disaster you can take the potassium iodide and ssk i is a nice little treatment for
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:06.600]  radioactive iodine disasters but even more importantly you have to have these supplements
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:12.760]  these components in your body at all times because if you don't have them your body will make do with
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:17.160]  what it can find and for example there's a component in our environment called bromide
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:23.080]  that is found in flour and it's found as a purifier of water and since the 1970s bakers have used this
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:29.240]  bromide to whiten their flour bromide looks to the body like iodine and if there is no iodine present
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:35.000]  from nutritional supplementation the thyroid will take in the bromide from the brominated flour and
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.880]  now you will have a brominated thyroid and you will end up suffering from the symptoms of brominosis
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:47.960]  and you will also end up with hypothyroid and it just exemplifies how important it is to have a
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:54.600]  baseline level of nutritional components in your body at all times all right then i apologize again
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.320]  and i want you to continue but it's really almost perfect timing to have you here today to show
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:05.320]  so just with this example of these reactors how all of this interacts but here's the bad news
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:15.080]  fox news associated press are now reporting radiation leak at the number one fukushima plant
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:22.200]  there's six of them there together the temperature is rising if it continues it will melt down in
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:31.000]  some way and could explode and go into a uh chair noble or uh china syndrome and of course that means
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.280]  quote melting through the earth uh is the term china syndrome possible radiation leak at japan
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:41.640]  nuclear plant a radiation leak could occur or could be occurring at the fukushima nuclear plant
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:48.920]  near tokyo and the aftermath of the 8.9 magnitude earthquake japanese trade minister uh bari kai
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:57.800]  aida told kiyoto news just minutes ago and there's 2,800 residents living near the reactor
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:03.080]  and they're saying that may need to evacuate how deceptive is that uh you know to only say the
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:09.480]  locals are worried i mean this thing is going to send radiation all over the world if it does melt
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.600]  down sorry ben go ahead well what i'm saying is that it's very important to have nutritional
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:19.480]  components in your body at all times because if you don't your body will make do with whatever
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:24.120]  it can find for example i gave example about bromide but fluoride is the same thing if you
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:30.120]  don't have iodine present in your body your thyroid will take in fluoride instead of the iodine
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.360]  that it needs and now you have fluoride taken up into the thyroid in addition to the bromide the
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:39.320]  bottom line is is you have to have these nutritional components in your system at all times and the
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:43.640]  simplest way to do it is through a nutritional supplement program that's why i'm behind the
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:46.920]  longevity products that's why i'm behind nutritional supplements supplementation and
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.920]  that's why i've been traveling around the country for the last 15 16 years talking about how
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:54.920]  important it is to make sure you have a baseline level of nutritional supplements going in your
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:01.400]  body at all times well the globalists know what they're doing saying hey you don't need the iodine
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:07.240]  in your food you need the bromide knowing it's toxic knowing the sodium fluoride is toxic
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:14.520]  what do you make a pharmacist been fuchs of suddenly the epa going okay we are going to
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:19.160]  look at stopping using fluoride as a pesticide maybe we're going to look at not allowing it to
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:25.640]  be put in flour to bleach things we're going to look at cutting it in water it looks like we're
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:30.600]  starting to win the fight against these people the only way we can win the fight is if we take
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:35.560]  the ball into our own court it's it doesn't do any good to hand ring and to complain and to wine
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:39.800]  we have to take the ball into our own court and as long as we're sick we're not going to be strong
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.520]  enough to fight this tyranny we have to make sure that we have the raw materials in our body to
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:49.080]  maintain good health so we do not have to interface with the medical model if you're okay you're
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:54.200]  going to be forced to interface briefly recap who you are how you woke up you're always talking
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:59.640]  about the thyroid so many women now have an epidemic of thyroid dysfunction their hair falling out
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:05.240]  their overweight same thing with men and they'll just give the women heart artificial thyroid
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:11.400]  instead of telling them and this is on record hey it's the fluoride hey it's the so just in that area
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:17.560]  break down how important this is get into other mineral deficiencies because if you're deficient
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:21.640]  then other things are going to take the place and then last time we didn't talk much about it
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:26.040]  run down the longevity products that are available and we can discount to the listeners
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:30.280]  and folks this is about taking action this is i say buy gold it goes up i say get the minerals i
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:37.240]  mean i promote what i believe in at info wars team that's one word info wars team dot com
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:43.560]  break it down for people this is what i noticed 15 16 years ago when i started to explore this
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:48.600]  idea of disease from a pharmacy perspective we have all kinds of symptoms that people suffer from
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.360]  whether it's fiber myalgia or whether it's headaches or whether it's blood pressure issues
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:57.880]  or blood sugar issues whatever we have lots of symptoms but all symptoms come from three places
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:02.520]  and three places only if you attack the symptoms you end up playing that silly game that people
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:07.080]  play at the amusement park where they hit the mole in one hole and the mole pops up in another
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:11.320]  hole and that's what the medical model does it hits the mole in one hole and then it hits the
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:16.040]  mole in the other hole and it keeps trying to hit the moles hits hit the moles but if you attack
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:22.600]  the problem at the causal level the symptoms all fall into line and the causal levels are three
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:28.120]  number one first and foremost all disease is connected to the digestive system and then secondly
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:34.040]  the blood sugar and insulin system and then thirdly the adrenal gland stress system so
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:39.400]  all disease needs to be backtracked first and foremost to the digestive system no matter what
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:44.520]  your symptoms are you have to figure out what your digest what the digestive component is
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.120]  and that involves supplementation and that involves lifestyle changes around the food
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:53.080]  you're eating secondly you have to get your blood sugar and your insulin under control and once
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.800]  again that involves supplementation and it involves lifestyle choices that you're making
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:03.560]  and third of all you have to get your adrenal gland stress gland system under control and that
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.680]  involves once again lifestyle changes and nutritional supplementation the bottom line is
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:14.360]  through lifestyle changes and nutritional supplementation attacking this triangle of disease
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:20.440]  at the causal level no matter what your symptoms are they cannot help but fall into line whether
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:24.280]  it's losing weight whether it's dropping your blood pressure whether it's making your diabetes
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:29.320]  or your arthritis disappear or your fibromyalgia or your migraine headaches whatever if you attack
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:35.080]  it at the causal level through the triangle of disease using nutritional supplementation and
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:40.920]  lifestyle digestive food strategies all of your symptoms will fall into line and the key component
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:46.840]  here as always is going to be nutritional supplementation because the foods are corrupt
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.960]  the foods are corrupt from the soil upward there's no minerals in the soil or there's
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:56.280]  few minerals in the soil which means there's less nutrients in the produce which means there's
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.440]  less nutrients in the meat and the fish that we're eating so there's no way around it you
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:06.040]  got to get yourself on a nutritional supplementation program the good news is the body is infinitely
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:13.560]  resilient infinitely forgiving in a healing and rejuvenating system that's highly divinely designed
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:17.880]  to heal and renew itself on a moment to moment basis so once you start to incorporate these
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:22.200]  nutritional supplement components and once you start to make lifestyle changes around the foods
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.800]  you're eating your body will heal immediately and i'm talking about the second you start to
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:32.600]  make these changes and that's the good news and then i program the bright side absolutely and
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:39.960]  and uh ben fuchs you know i i talked to talk and i walked to walk on most issues but i told charlie
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:45.560]  sheen three weeks ago i said get a twitter communicate directly with your fans boomy did it
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:52.360]  but then i don't even promote my own twitter i was always a big exercise person then i got out of it
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:57.160]  i got out of shape for years i've been trying to get back in shape i don't eat fast food stuff like
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:02.760]  that very often i've gotten a lot healthier but it's hard to pull out of it and i've never been in
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:07.080]  the habit of eating vitamins taking minerals the tangy tangerine my wife loves it and is addicted
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:11.640]  to it says it's the best stuff she's ever had she's totally blown away right now uh by how good the
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:19.000]  longevity products are and i'm literally just now making myself since i got sick last week
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:24.520]  follow my own orders and start taking it and now i'm well and i feel better than ever so people
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:30.280]  from here on out we're going to see in the next few months the transformation that takes place on
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:35.000]  these products uh i mean you're going to see it here on air and see what happens but everybody
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.720]  i know just loves them and the differences and why i did the research and decided to work with ben
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:45.880]  and you know the other great folks that are involved dr joel wallack the inventor is because
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:51.800]  i've separately and doesn't mean i i talk to talk i'm starting to try to walk to walk i've
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:57.480]  researched synthetic vitamins uh you know true you know uh vitamins and minerals that come from an
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:03.240]  absorbable natural source and that's why ben fuchs separately you know because he's he's his own
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:07.160]  man has his own products you name it really loves young jevity because he's looked at a lot of
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.760]  products himself and knows these truly have the right ingredients explain what's in the young
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.960]  jevity products at info wars team dot com that will put on screen for president planet dot tv
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:22.600]  viewers for radio listeners go to info wars team dot com and we have videos of our last interview
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:27.800]  with ben fuchs and i apologize we put the wrong photo up even though i know ben
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:32.360]  but it looked a little bit like him uh up there last time we'll put the new video up today and
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:38.680]  of course dr joel wallack but expanding on this water what's the difference between young jevity
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:43.080]  and so many other products well let me tell you a couple things first of all i talked about the
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:46.680]  digestive system and if you're going to start a supplement program you want to make absolutely
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.440]  sure that you start your your nutritional supplement program with digestive supplements
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:55.000]  because it doesn't matter what you're taking if you're not absorbing them so most importantly
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.760]  you want to focus on digestive enzymes and probiotics and things that help you absorb
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:02.120]  nutrients but i want to get to that in a second because you asked a very interesting question
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:07.880]  about the young jevity products specifically and dr wallack who is one of my nutritional heroes
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.960]  in fact he's my main nutritional hero and nutritional guru what makes him so brilliant is he was one
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:17.720]  of the first people to catch on to the idea that minerals have to be in the correct form for them
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:23.240]  to have their activity minerals have an electrical property but in order for them to have that
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:27.800]  electrical property or to have that electrical property be usable by the body the minerals
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:34.200]  have to be in a format that we call colloidal now over the years over millions of years plants that
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:39.240]  have uh have developed have evolved the ability to take rocks from the earth and turn them into
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:43.480]  these colloidal substances over the course of millions of years as the plants die off and the
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:49.560]  organic matter starts to decay what's left behind are the minerals that the plant has taken from
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:55.480]  the earth and activated and electrified in a colloidal format and today we can actually scoop
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:01.560]  those minerals out from areas where plants have been concentrated over the course of eons we can
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:06.360]  scoop those minerals out of of mines and out of caves and out of seabeds and we can put them
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:12.280]  in liquid drinks and reactivate those minerals make them electrically active again and dr
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:17.000]  wallick was one of the first guys to talk about this and he developed an entire nutritional
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.920]  company built around the concept of electrified colloidal plant activated minerals and when you
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:28.440]  drink these minerals that have been put back into a liquid suspension put back into a liquid format
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:33.960]  you are literally drinking electrical energy an electrical energy that's being delivered at
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:39.880]  frequencies that are specific to each mineral and that's what the core of the ungevity concept is
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:45.560]  that's what the core of the ungevity products are is these electrified colloidal mineral drinks
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:52.040]  and to quantify that the body is electrochemical for those that don't know and to simplify it
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:57.240]  these are the type they need and have the absorbability to i mean to dumb it down
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:03.720]  just mainline nutrition they have the synthetic cheap vitamins that i've read mainline studies
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:09.480]  are even toxic to the body versus what they call the naturally occurring vitamins and minerals
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.880]  can you explain that well the core is always going to be the minerals vitamins as a matter
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:21.000]  of fact are defined technically as co-enzymes vitamins are co-factors they help chemical
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.160]  reactions work and they help facilitate chemical reactions and without them you would die but the
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:30.040]  core of everything that we talk about are these electrical components that are known as minerals
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:34.200]  when we talk about a mineral folks what we're really talking about is a battery and that's
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:38.520]  why you have lithium batteries and nickel batteries and cadmium batteries and your
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.440]  batteries have zinc in them and you look at all batteries you'll find minerals there because
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:46.840]  minerals function as little tiny microscopic batteries and when you ingest them into your
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:52.040]  system you're literally ingesting a microscopic electrical battery that's going to prove yeah
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:58.840]  folks that's how food works and then and then oxygen is the main driver that is pushing through
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:04.200]  the system the different vitamins and minerals that are needed to drive the machines that are
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:09.560]  inside the cells oxygen is what explodes it's like in your car when if you look at your these
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:13.240]  have carburetor in the car now they have fuel injection but the way it used to work is oxygen
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:18.120]  would get pumped in and a spark would ignite the oxygen and your piston would move oxygen
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:25.080]  is explosive oxygen it burns things and so when you inhale oxygen eats metal oxygen eats metal
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:31.240]  well oxygen is important for the burning process to take place but without these nutrients the
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:37.080]  oxygen burning occurs willy nilly and it burns everything it burns metals like you say oxidation
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:42.200]  occurs everywhere the importance of nutrients is it allows this oxygen burning to take place in a
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:47.640]  controlled fashion without having nutrients in your body the oxygen burning takes place in an
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:53.720]  explosive fashion and that's one of the leading ways that we die is we oxidize we burn the importance
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:58.440]  of nutritional supplementation be they minerals or be they vitamins or be they anti-oxidants
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:03.960]  is these components channel oxygen into the right pathway so that the burning occurs
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:08.760]  in an efficient I read this 20 years ago but now I'm seeing reports that that's actually
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:14.280]  oxygenation going on in the arteries and veins and that when you don't have the proper oxygen
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:19.800]  and the proper minerals to use it that it starts burning basically to simplify it in the arteries
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:26.120]  and so it basically fries minerals and compounds that should have been used by cells it's like a
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:31.400]  car smoking it just it just oxidizes out in the arteries that's exactly what happens it's like
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:36.440]  a rustings and in fact rusting is an example how do you make your if you cut an apple and you leave
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.200]  it out in oxygen you leave it out in the room it turns brown right that's a classic example of
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:45.160]  oxidation you put lemon juice on the apple which has vitamin C it stops the oxidation from occurring
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.320]  and that's basically what happens inside your body and then you got the chicken heart studies
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:53.880]  with nutrients keeping alive so long I mean it's real simple but they you know they keep it voodoo
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:58.680]  so you don't know about it pharmacist Ben Fuchs is our amazing guest info wars team dot coms where

[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:19.080]  yes quake caused mass chaos people poured in the streets for my apartment my wife and i could see
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:30.280]  the oba bayah on fire we got reports here again out of oregon and other towns venadel mar we'll
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:36.920]  decide in the next three hours whether to evacuate smaller tsunamis did hit the hawaiian islands
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:44.200]  there was a huge whirlpool created off the coast of japan sucking down ships we even have video of
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:49.880]  that i mean this is something out of a science fiction movie but you know truth is stranger
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:54.840]  than fiction we need to pray for everybody there and then the big news they're now saying the
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.800]  reactor could be leaking abc news reports the pressure is going up we're going to continue to
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:07.000]  follow reactor number one at that facility and what's happening there meanwhile paul watson
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:15.720]  has a big report out we'll put it on screen uh saying no the earthquake was not caused by
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:21.560]  global warming because the bbc and everybody else are already claiming that it is unbelievable
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:27.160]  that they will seize on any tragedy to push their takeover to society and to blame it
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:30.760]  on humankind i know you guys gave that to me but just put it on screen or print it again
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.920]  yeah there it is global warming did not cause the japanese earthquake bbc reporter
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:40.520]  spouts lies about disappearing south pacific islands to imply man-made climate change
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:47.000]  connection to the devastating tsunami unbelievable evil get that out to counter these people
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.680]  global warming did not cause the japanese earthquake going back to pharmacist ben fuchs

[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:17.240]  i've bought big boxes of it and given it to friends and family great way to introduce them to it
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:22.760]  the tangy tangerine some of the other products ben fuchs going over as a pharmacist some of your
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:27.000]  favorite young jevity products and what you recommend for somebody who's going to try something out
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.040]  just for wide spectrum you know natural vitamins and minerals right i'll tell you the perfect
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:35.480]  product to try out if you want to experience how effective this is let me tell you something else
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:41.000]  alex the sicker you are the less healthy you are the needier you are in terms of nutritional
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.960]  supplementation the faster you notice results that's the beautiful thing about nutritional
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:50.680]  supplementation is your body as soon as it sees these things if it's in a deficiency state it will
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:55.480]  suck these materials up like a dry sponge sucks up water and that's why my favorite product and
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:57:00.680]  i love a lot of these products but my favorite product is the beyond tangy tangerine let me tell
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:05.720]  you why it is a powder that you put into water and drink and in pharmacy school one of the first
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:12.120]  things they teach us is the route of administration has a dramatic effect on how well a nutrient
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:16.920]  is absorbed a pill is the poorest route of administration a capsule is a little bit better
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:23.640]  a liquid is a very effective route of administration because you bypass the digestive process it goes
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:28.440]  right to work and many of us are compromised through the digestive system so when you drink your
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:34.120]  nutrients you get rapid absorption the beyond tangy tangerine at 48 dollars and 50 cents a month
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:41.160]  is a ridiculously ridiculously cheap and effective way what is that like a dollar 30 a day to get
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:45.960]  everything i'm telling you it's not even a it's not even a cup of coffee a day for 48
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:51.880]  dollars and 50 cents but what do you get for that you get large doses generous copious amounts of
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:58.360]  vitamin a of vitamin c of vitamin d of vitamin e of vitamin k of the b vitamins of zinc and
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:03.480]  on and on and on in a liquid format you could put it in a water bottle and drink it and the
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:09.640]  body loves to have the nutrients delivered to it in a slow sustained release fashion and when
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:13.480]  you drink your nutrients out of a water bottle you give your nutrients you give your body the
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:17.800]  nutrients in this slow release fashion that your body loves and how many minerals does it have in
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:24.840]  it it's got all the minerals 92 plus all plant derived the way i explained earlier and on the
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:30.200]  website info wars team dot com you can also find the phone number you've got any questions i want

[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:22.280]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:29.320]  well more more western governments are moving towards an open invasion or at least bombardment
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:35.480]  and uh no fly zone of muammar qaddafi as their rebels are getting routed all over the country by
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:40.760]  qaddafi right now because his intelligence apparatus wasn't totally controlled by the
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:46.280]  globalist mike mubarak's in egypt japan struggling to cool down nuclear plant minister says still
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:54.360]  in usa today uh fox news are both reporting a slightly radioactive vapor uh is being released
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:01:00.040]  from the reactor so they're off venting and quite frankly i can't blame them if they can't cool it
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:05.560]  by pumping water through it like they normally do they got to open it up that's a lot better
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:11.640]  than that sucker completely blowing up and melting down but they need to tell people to evacuate
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:17.800]  they need to be telling them with the meteorologist how to get out of the line of the of the of the
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:24.040]  fallout if it does get worse but now it's confirmed that some of this fallout is going on

[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:27.800]  with a layer of essential fatty acids if you are in a deficiency state every cell in your body will
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:32.440]  be compromised and unless you're supplementing you are in a deficiency state because they're not

[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:59.240]  areas of cities like matchsticks buildings and homes and undoubtedly tens of thousands dying
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:04.920]  they're now saying it's above a thousand found dead but the disaster is still ongoing with water
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:12.760]  just now receding hours later and fires all over the ravaged area there are six nuclear
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:26.600]  reactors in one complex and it is being reported widely by cnn fox usa today the japanese government
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:32.200]  is on record japan struggling to cool down nuclear plant minister says officials ordered
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:37.480]  an evacuation friday of residents living near a japanese nuclear power plant saying there has
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:44.040]  been no sign yet of leaks but indicating a struggle to cool down one of the atomic facilities
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:51.000]  now that was before they came out in usa today minutes after that and said japan to release
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:56.440]  slightly radioactive vapor because they got to open it up somehow the water is not getting through
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:02.600]  the coolant isn't getting through the u.s military has gotten nuclear submarine facilities nearby
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:09.080]  just wonder what happened to them just delivered some of the a special coolant that they're not
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:13.960]  revealing what type but it's not water and they're saying the u.s military is standing by to assist
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:18.520]  the japanese now that's also the associated press japanese authorities will release slightly
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:24.040]  radioactive vapor to release pressure at a disabled nuclear power plant well it's probably either that
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.680]  than have it go chair noble so release release that's the problem with nuclear reactors why not go
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:35.960]  with coal or hydroelectric i mean come on japan's nuclear safety agency said pressure inside one of
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:43.960]  the six boiling water reactors at the fukushima plant had risen 1.5 times the level considered
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:49.800]  normal the associated press reports and still rising they're unable to cool it as of minutes ago
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:53.880]  the agency said the radioactive element in the vapor would not affect the environment or human
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:59.640]  health they told you the dust was safe at ground zero two why not just tell the truth guys officials
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:05.160]  have declared japan's first ever nuclear emergency in order to evacuation of 3000 nearby residents
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:10.920]  they've had events where they've had purifying units blow up remember that and they just cover
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:15.240]  it up i mean who knows what's really going on and of course they're not telling the locals to
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:21.960]  evacuate and the locals are reportedly sitting there waiting for orders get out go
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:28.520]  upwind get out do you don't want to be downwind of this go the opposite direction of the way the
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:33.560]  wind's going to blow man and let's hope it doesn't happen probably not going to melt down let's be
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:39.000]  positive let's pray about it let's hope but i mean let's say there's a five percent chance
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:44.920]  a ten percent chance it's going to melt down and go chair noble get out of there get out of there
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:50.840]  bob Chapman joins us every friday we're going to open it seems like every ten minutes he's on it

[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:45.160]  else i'm not going to go through the whole thing he helped publish an undare call conspiracy with
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:49.800]  gary allen he's been fighting the globalists for almost 50 years just like dr stan monteef
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:54.920]  who will vouch that bob's in an icon from the very beginning he co-owned the gary allen report
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:13:02.360]  gary allen's son now started and runs politico i should add which had 30 000 subscribers and
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:06.680]  he is currently the owner of the international forecaster which reaches people in more than
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:13.080]  80 countries this is an old bio it says 60 and the international forecaster dot com bob all
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:18.200]  bedlam has broken loose they're talking about evacuating areas of origan i don't know why
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:25.080]  not washington or california uh but i'm in my experience of a tsunami happens 5000 miles away
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:29.400]  it's normally going to dissipate but who knows it might be a problem for cruise ships out there we
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:35.000]  know some larger waves tsunami style did come in on the beach and cause some limited damage in the
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:42.280]  hawaiian islands but uh a lot of crazy things going on there i mean i don't even know what to
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:48.200]  cover now it's like we've got more news than i could ever cover it's it seems like the craziness
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:54.280]  has happened and i had a top astrophysicist on who is one of the most accurate forecasters in the
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:14:01.480]  world the first hour but and he said no doubt this was the massive near record solar flare hitting
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:07.960]  the southern hemisphere well directly hitting into antarctica and causing power problems and
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:15.400]  things in south africa and chili that hit yesterday another one hit 36 hours ago so a
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:20.600]  half day before that and he said it's the two coinciding with the quote huge moon
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:27.480]  closest to the earth it's been since 92 pulling magma not just the tides of the ocean at a record
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:33.240]  level that those two things caused the plates to move abc news is concurring with their scientist
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:39.400]  on that but al gore the bbc are saying it's global warming if we pay that wicked demon a bunch of
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:45.720]  money he'll wave a magic pixie wand and give us Vatican indulgences to heal us from purgatory
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:52.520]  and hades so what's your view and in the accelerating craziness well i think we have to
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:15:01.400]  accelerate the departure of al gore to wherever he's going in hate for a starter and uh thank you
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:09.400]  and i've got to say this i've been doing vitamins minerals herbs and hormones for 47 years i check
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:15.560]  up at the doctor once a year and he looked at me yesterday and he said there's something wrong with
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:24.840]  you and i said what he said your blood pressure is 115 over 70 how can that be for a man your age
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:32.520]  anyway that's what comes of taking care of yourself and using preventive things that are being
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:39.400]  discussed on alex's program and i thank you for doing it because it works and you plug that everywhere
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:43.640]  i've heard you on coast to coast a m and other shows and you'll you'll be talking about you know
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:49.000]  the economy you'll say excuse me george or excuse me the other host i just heard an ad for uh you
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:56.280]  know uh uh you know prostate uh uh uh uh plant extract boy let me tell you it works great but
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:01.240]  then even the mainline studies show that that particular plant i forget which one it is uh
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:07.640]  has four or five times in the studies what the expensive drugs have but the doctors won't tell
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:12.440]  them because the bottle of its ten dollars instead of a thousand dollars a month or the
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:16.040]  you know cancer surgery they want to give you what's the prostate thing you take
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:26.120]  uh better prostate and it's roger mason's product and roger was uh is a subscriber for many years
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:32.600]  i've been taking it i think for 18 years and i'm 75 and everything still works and i've never had a
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:37.640]  problem in fact when they do the specific antigen tests they say we can't believe this
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:42.120]  and i forget there's a couple plants and i don't know when they combo them together to
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:47.240]  cause that amplifying effect what's the plant that uh they admit is like magic for your prostate
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:52.920]  but the doctors won't tell you to take it i don't know i gotta be honest so paul meadow
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:56.840]  that's right and then there's one more yeah so but this is far more powerful than that
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:04.920]  and it really works and uh alec uh roger uh advertises on this network and many others
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:11.960]  and uh all of his products are very good and i take them all and we do it every day
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:16.280]  yeah i don't even know he sponsored us but i always sponsors everything basically
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:20.360]  all right now now now bob shifting gears now what do you make of the reactor
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:24.840]  that they said they're going to release radiation from and they can't get cooling into it that's
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:33.160]  pretty scary it certainly is especially for the people of japan who had to go through that
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:41.560]  terrible experience and at the end of the second world war and uh it was awful and everybody knows
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:49.640]  that and uh it's just like you know the ghost of hero shimer and nagasaki coming back i sure hope
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:56.680]  that they can get the fix and i think they can and so as you said let's pray that it works
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:06.040]  uh these people don't deserve this uh nobody does but anyway um the damage will be unbelievable
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:14.840]  and um i'm not an expert so i don't know what cost it and probably the gentleman that you had on
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:23.720]  the expert who described it um we're having i'm getting letters about harp but i don't know
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:32.440]  i'm an other expert on that and so um i think they're going to need help too and well bob i mean
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:40.040]  look harp is a little tinker toy made by man trying to compete with god's harp the sun and moon i mean
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:44.920]  what do people think that their magnetic fields we got hit by a giant solar flare two of them
[02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:50.040]  at the same time the moon's the closest to the earth that's been in 19 years which they admit
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:55.320]  pulls the magma not just the oceans that's what causes but this is a hundred percent fact the moon
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:19:00.920]  is what controls the ocean's tides it also pulls the magma scientists know that the magnetic field
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:08.440]  changes with the moon so that's what did it but al gore again says pay him money that we caused it
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:17.720]  well you know i it was just a couple of days ago we saw the eruptions in hawaii at the volcanoes
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:23.720]  and to professionals that should have been a giant clue that there was trouble on the way
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:29.400]  well i mean japan didn't build its houses out of paper because they've never had an earthquake
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:36.840]  or a tsunami before and uh just how dumb does al gore and the un and bbc think we are for those
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:41.560]  that don't know uh watch has got an article documenting it they're saying man caused the
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:48.520]  earthquake so they can make us guilty and say we're bad and say we're demons and attack us and
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:53.400]  i mean there's no end to these criminals they want to make us guilty you're racist if you don't
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:57.240]  turn your guns in you're racist if you don't accept government health care you're racist if you

[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:56.920]  gold shooting up now correcting a bit uh all of this happening and then we had the big bond house
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:02.840]  i covered it yesterday bloomberg uh broke it uh well first they said the biggest and some said one
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:08.520]  of the biggest uh brokerage houses investment funds in the world and bob chairman can talk about this
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:14.120]  first has said no more dollars no more t-bills we're done and then you had wall street journal on
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:18.360]  monday saying the end of the dollar is nine and then it was a good thing it was going to be good
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:23.160]  for us bob like jumping into a meat grinder or jumping off a cliff or playing in traffic or
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:27.720]  eating cyanide or slitting our wrist it's wonderful uh what's your take on all the
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:38.280]  crazy things that are going on well bill gross is uh essentially a professional gambler uh
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:45.160]  he is the head of pymco uh and they are the largest bond house in the world uh they're
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:54.520]  owned by alliance out of germany and uh bill knows how to figure the odds he's a great trader uh
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:00.520]  enormously successful worked very closely in in helping the government uh when they went through
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:08.440]  their trying times uh oh oh two to three years ago and bought lots and lots of uh bonds for them
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:16.760]  uh to help them along and so for him to exit his treasuries and i'm sure he's out of his uh agency
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:24.760]  bonds as well those are the bonds from fanny may fray mack jimmy and fha uh it's an extremely
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:31.800]  significant event what he's saying is i see down the road here that we're going to have lots of
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:39.560]  inflation the united states government has piles of debt and most of it is being purchased by the
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:45.640]  fed reserve who makes money up out of thin air and that's not very good so he doesn't want to have
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:52.520]  any part of that and that's super intelligent and uh but i wouldn't expect anything less from him
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:27:06.280]  uh he's among the best at the same time carl icon who is a money manager and a professional
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:16.440]  uh in the business of buying out companies and all sorts of corporate finance uh he's in his 80s
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:23.480]  and he's had a magnificent career he shut down his hedge fund and about the same time
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:29.640]  that's right uh four days ago uh we have the wall street journal time magazine a whole
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:33.240]  bunch of others come out and say the dollar will be dead the chinese announced they're no
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:40.600]  longer going to accept dollars to buy their finished uh retail goods we now have x goldman
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:46.440]  sax analyst saying major war coming at end of 2012 that's a prison planet dot com article with the
[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:52.120]  video uh we have the chinese president saying the end of the dollar is nine uh we've got one of the
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:57.560]  other biggest bond traders and investors as you said telling his investors i don't want to be in
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:03.880]  the stock market right now i mean the and this isn't henry paulson out there trying to create a
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:11.160]  correction or a crisis to panic folks to give him trillions they're just quietly exiting the room
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:14.920]  and it's kind of like when a party starts to end one person leaves and suddenly a few others do and
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:19.080]  then suddenly everybody's leaving are we reaching that point where everybody's starting to get up to
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:29.080]  leave the party uh no but some are and the the very introspective outside the box thinkers
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:36.120]  and you've got two of them there and what carl carl actually said was i don't want to be responsible
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:42.040]  for these people's future and their losses if that were to occur yeah that was the quote in
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:48.440]  yeah so what is it in essence saying look let's get out of the way there's some bad stuff coming
[02:28:49.960 --> 02:28:54.760]  very simple and so you put it together with the other things that you've mentioned
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:29:00.680]  and the things that i talk i write about every week and talk about every week on programs
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:07.800]  and uh we've got dire problems the whole world has but ours in england's and europe's are the worst
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:15.080]  and i think we're going to find that china and japan are going to be coming closer behind us
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:20.680]  with many of the nations now bob's will be nations that work it won't get hit too bad go ahead no
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:25.640]  no we'll come back up to break but i i saw that article earlier in the week i barely mentioned it
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:30.760]  give us the name of the trader again because he's a top guy and those were exact quotes you were
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:35.560]  getting i want to pull the article up during the break who was the other guy uh carl icon
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:43.400]  and uh the other is bill gross yeah i know that bill is with tim coe i know the pimp coe
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:49.560]  yeah but the carl icon the headline was no longer no longer managing investors stocks

[02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:23.720]  money billionaire hedge fund manager carl icon is returning capital to outside investors
[02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:29.880]  marking the end of an era as he joins other prominent stock pickers who no longer want the
[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:35.080]  headaches of handling other people's money but when you actually read then his quotes that's
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:40.600]  Reuters spin it's not oh the headaches of billions he makes no he says it's too dangerous in fact i'll
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:47.160]  go to the quotes after bob continues and you know he just says he doesn't want to hurt people he's
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:51.640]  saying get out and then i've seen the numbers bob can you quantify these but i've seen even
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:58.120]  mainstream articles about it that insiders are getting out of the market at five times the numbers
[02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:03.000]  that newbies and the general public and government investments are getting in with people's pension
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:09.800]  funds so the big money is creeping away to the exits correct that is absolutely correct and
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:18.760]  it's been going on for about a year and sometimes the numbers are like 342 to one i mean there might
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:27.160]  be $50,000 worth of options exercised and how long against the sale of four billion eight hundred
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:33.400]  million or something i mean the figures are staggering of people who run companies getting
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:40.920]  out of the market so they're just propping things up long enough by printing trillions of dollars
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:46.520]  and other currencies worldwide to get themselves and their armored redoubts to get their bodyguards
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:51.640]  to get ready to kind of turn their SWAT teams loose on us they create the crisis society
[02:34:51.640 --> 02:34:57.880]  implodes they sit back turn the SWAT teams and troops loose on us and and then they emerge
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:04.200]  prancing around as the saviors later and then they're really gearing up for it i think you're
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:13.480]  right and what you've just said is correct although if they're going to use people they're
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:18.760]  going to have to use mercenaries and i've talked to too many people in the military they won't
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:24.760]  take an illegal order and they're not going to shoot american citizens and maybe mercenaries would
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:30.360]  but you know we don't have to go over the figures again but america's armed to the p
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:39.480]  and this you could bring in 10 million troops and they still lose well suddenly mainstream news
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:45.000]  is reporting like they're talking about you know the weather or the price of gasoline in you know
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:49.880]  at the corner market or when they're going to have a christmas tree lighting oh we've signed
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:57.160]  the north american SPP security perimeter to use mexican and canadian troops to deal with terrorists
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:04.920]  and troublemakers and the american people and uh i i sent the guys to chicago where they witnessed
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:12.040]  foreign european troops training to take americans guns it's on video and and and still americans
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:18.360]  are in denial even when i show them ap or ottawa citizen or own footage they go oh that's not true
[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:23.320]  your video doesn't show that when our guys were there they were practicing putting them
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:30.840]  in the football stadium dutch and check republic and polish troops with the chicago police
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:36.760]  and the national guard they are and they admit their training for us but the public says we're
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:43.320]  liars bob jevin that's right and uh they're going to be coming running in our direction when it
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:50.360]  happens is what do we do what do we do and uh well tell them lock and load that's the best thing you
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:55.800]  can do and by lock and load you mean you wouldn't listen by lock you mean put yourself in handcuffs
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:03.560]  and chain those to your ankles and then get in the position well actually it's the use of the
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:15.720]  n-1 grand and it was a top feeding magazine uh fed uh weapon uh that i used and um what you do is
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:23.400]  you lock and then you pull the uh slide back and then you drop your magazine in hoping you don't
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:29.240]  catch your thumb in there so that's called lock and al-qaeda i mean are you a supporter of the

[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:12.840]  government and there's one of the reasons i don't live there anymore because it'll like people like

[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:08.920]  uh your commentary is excellent because it makes people understand what the government is up to
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:14.440]  and what their thought process is they're helping people 11 years ago when they signed the secret
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:18.680]  deal to take all death benefits of trips what are you saying it's wrong when trips are paid to
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:22.520]  death benefits their whole life and they die and their widow gets the money you're saying that
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:27.560]  wasn't a classy cool good thing a prudential and other insurance companies are doing a secret
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:34.200]  deal with the government bloomberg ap are you saying that wasn't good your filth it was not good it

[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:30.040]  them right now on radio and through the internet and they are running around in circles they're
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:36.680]  expediting their program i'm sorry and they're in trouble and they know it and we have their names
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:44.840]  addresses phone numbers and when this thing breaks open they get a problem and all the king's horses
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:49.800]  and all the king's homeland security men aren't going to keep the big fat humpy dummies together
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:55.400]  that's right they've gone too far again this is not the first time they've done this
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:02.520]  but they don't care that's the risk they're willing to take to subjugate the people of the world and
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:08.600]  there's lots of very very bright people out there who know what they're doing who are telling people
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:13.560]  who don't realize what they're doing what they're doing and what you can do about it or at least

[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:44.360]  um and and i'm not going to go into the names and details but there was a beautiful piece
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:49.880]  of property in malibu i lived there for a long time and a gentleman and his wife lived there
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:59.800]  and the government decided they wanted that piece of land and uh they tried to put marijuana
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:03.560]  plants in this property didn't work out too well so they just walk up and shot him in the back
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:10.600]  that's a famous story that's right and i knew him and not very well but i knew him i had met
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:15.320]  him to other people and you know when you're involved in coaching for a long long time in
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:19.720]  the city you know everybody and they know their kids but anyway they murdered him
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:28.440]  and it's not too far from where i lived in charlie and martin live and so on and that's
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:34.760]  the kind of police state we live in this was going on for years by the way the police memos that
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:38.840]  case made national news came out where they were planning to kill him and get the property because
[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:42.680]  that wasn't something like 80 acres or something was worth hundreds of millions but he just wanted
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:46.600]  to keep it and they kept saying sell it and then and then the cops even tried to get the money
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:52.360]  themselves but see that he deserved to die you shouldn't know private property that's right
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:58.600]  he's like me i deserve to die because i'm a terrorist yep i'm glad you admit it
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:05.000]  and i'm very proud to admit and all the babies deserve to be aborted too it's it's it's a christian
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:11.000]  well i disagree with that too well i'm being sarcastic bob but i mean you know let's be a
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:19.480]  modern americans well i'm not very modern i guess i'm uh what would you call it a uh
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:25.960]  a throwback throwback a throwback sort of uh pithocanthropus erectus
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:35.160]  are the uh pro magnate uh well a little bit beyond that a typical 12th century man
[02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:40.760]  so you're uh you're uh well yeah i kind of see myself as a stone age man of course that would
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:47.000]  be uh 10 000 years ago before the dawn of the bronze age 9 000 and the hiberian maxim
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:53.080]  um let's talk to josh in new york you're on the air go ahead josh what's going on
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:48:00.360]  worldwide transmission with a terrorist named bob chairman you're hilarious listen now i truly
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:05.400]  believe this is a government controlled event today i might be way off base here with this well
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:10.120]  the pentagon admits they have tectonic weapons army times 1997 in fact we ever looked that up
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:16.200]  i think it was april 1997 secretary of defense coming i'm sorry so you think you're harping on
[02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:20.840]  heart what do you think happened i think there was bombs under the ocean i think the government
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:26.600]  did this whole thing well there is the tsunami bomb that the uh at the end of world war two
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:33.240]  that's uh the the times of australia they were thinking about detonating a tsunami bomb an a bomb
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:37.800]  off the coast of japan but they decided to go ahead and drop them on them so it is true they
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:45.880]  have a tsunami bomb program bob chairman any comments on that no not really i um i grew up
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:55.000]  during that era but uh other than the fact that they hit those two cities um my mind doesn't
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:59.720]  work in those channels well even if you criticize dropping a bombs on japan it didn't happen if you
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:06.440]  support the dropping of the bombs it happened in europe patriot i i think uh it was necessary
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:12.440]  because they didn't want to lose any more people yeah well then well then the attack existed then
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:17.160]  um it would be a conspiracy theory there was no atomic attack if you're against it uh thank you

[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:19.480]  area by uh the corners of um arkansas and uh kansas yeah the new madrid fault line area where
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:24.360]  there's a huge nuclear reactor well you know the mississippi rivers changed course a couple times
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:28.840]  just since the louisiana purchase because of earthquakes there is a big fault line there and
[02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:33.800]  they are doing a drill up there and so but i mean they did a drill a building seven being attacked
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:39.800]  on 9 11 they did drills of the 7 7 attacks at the exact same time exact same place on the

[02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:25.480]  air i gotta call my wife because it'll just take a couple days if it doesn't melt down for the
[02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:29.800]  radiation to get here our news will tell us everything's fine even as detectors are going off
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:35.720]  i gotta get my kids on potassium iodate but hopefully it's not going to melt down a few
[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:41.400]  hours ago they were talking about opening up the reactor to let off the heat because they
[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:48.440]  can't get coolant through it and it's a big one of six in a nest of them now the government has
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:55.240]  said they are now releasing radioactive vapor but that's nothing compared to a meltdown
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:55:04.120]  and it's all they can do that's the danger of nuclear unbelievable so uh japan to release
[02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:10.120]  radioactive vapor new plant and it goes on to say they're now doing it so they've gone from saying
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:15.960]  they might do they are i'll be back sunday four to six p.m central i'm gonna go into overdrive a
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:22.440]  little bit in the next hour so we can get to uh jordan richard john ken and chris uh but i mean
[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:27.320]  what else briefly can they do bob Chapman uh if they can't get coolant through it and they admit it
[02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:33.560]  continues to heat up they're gonna have to off vent the boiling water uh into the atmosphere
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:37.160]  there's really nothing else they can do but what's gonna happen are they just gonna like
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:41.960]  artificially bring in other pipes and start dumping water right on top of it i mean is this
[02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:51.160]  thing gonna go Chernobyl it could and uh i hope that they're telling everybody to get out of town
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:58.040]  and get out fast if they can start walking if you have to i think they have about a 30 mile radius
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:08.680]  that they uh uh fallout uh if the thing goes the fallout can uh uh visit upon people is that
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:13.240]  figure correct do you think 30 miles well yeah if you drop an a bomb on somebody there's not high
[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:17.400]  winds but when they when it melts down it goes into the other isotopes and other metals and
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:22.840]  creates really radioactive uh groupings and then it can go into the jet stream Chernobyl
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:28.520]  it was like a thousand mile plus plume of of land that's still contaminated thousands and
[02:56:28.520 --> 02:56:34.600]  thousands dead connected to it uh so this thing will go worldwide but yeah the the epicenter uh
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:39.800]  you know generally uh and depending on the winds you know would be 30 to 50 miles depending on how
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:44.280]  they're blowing uh but it's a dose everybody's gonna get uh hopefully it isn't gonna happen
[02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:48.760]  everybody should be praying right now Jordan in Canada you're on the air with a terrorist Bob
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:56.280]  Chapman yeah i just have a quick uh couple questions here um uh one is dealing with uh
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:57:02.680]  the new world order and how we're being uh led to these FEMA camps you mean our saviors the good
[02:57:02.680 --> 02:57:06.760]  people that aren't the terrorist yes are you talking about about government okay well they
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:15.560]  they're what makes the grass grow okay so um now uh tv they don't call tv shows programming for
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:21.320]  nothing now i've been noticing a lot of uh alien movies coming out dealing with aliens and stuff
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:26.600]  like that now do you think the government is desensitizing uh the general public to the
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:31.960]  thought well and a lot of its entertainment too yeah i mean they'll put other they don't even
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:35.640]  need to have the overall message in a film now with the flicker rates they can manipulate the
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:41.800]  metabolic rate of the brain itself separate from the overall message but there there is admitted
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:47.480]  government programs project blue beam and others to do fake alien landings i appreciate your call
[02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:56.040]  comment on that bob Chapman i have none it's beyond uh my abilities to answer that that's
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:58:01.720]  because you're a terrorist of course well you now you're being racist towards the gray aliens
[02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:08.920]  no no no i just never encountered any and i don't really know where there are not having
[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:16.520]  a comment is racist okay are you a i'll accept that are you a planophobe what are you called
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:21.320]  being scared of aliens it is xenophobe if you don't like a particular group of people say
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:26.680]  that want to kill you so what what's not liking the aliens are you an alien denier
[02:58:26.680 --> 02:58:33.400]  how do you know i might be an alien maybe you should be arrested maybe you're
[02:58:33.400 --> 02:58:39.320]  denying that the aliens exist maybe that's code for racism man he there's no end to the sickening

[03:00:36.680 --> 03:00:43.320]  richard in vermont probably a terrorist as well you're on the air go ahead sir yeah how you're
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:51.240]  doing alex and bob rob yeah i'm definitely a terrorist i uh i actually withdrew all my money
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:55.080]  out of the bank yesterday and i told him to start sending my unemployment checks to my house and

[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:05.720]  standing up well all right well um yeah i mean you can only throw up so much you're like the
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:13.000]  founding fathers an actual real man putting on the line how an american sorry yeah um i wanted
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:19.960]  to i wanted to mention i was looking at a video that they had on mms nbc and they showed all of
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:27.240]  the uh the tsunami is starting to affect the west coast uh down in the uh monterey bay area
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:33.000]  and what was happening was all the boats that were moored there were starting to come out it
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:38.040]  looked like they were moving out to sea from yeah that happens that happens generally there's
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:43.960]  different types but yeah they get sucked out first before the wave comes back in what i
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:53.400]  wanted to do was remind everybody that i remember the i remember the uh uh the indonesian tsunami
[03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:58.840]  they had a bunch of kids that were playing on the beach and when the water receded so far back
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:04.040]  there was there were fish flopping around on the sand because uh and they the kids ran out to play
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:09.720]  with the there could be a there could be a big tsunami uh in the next few hours headed headed
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:15.240]  out there well what happens is these kids went out there and they were playing because the the
[03:02:15.240 --> 03:02:20.680]  tide receded so quickly because the energy of the tsunami sucks the water out before it actually
[03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:26.520]  comes back in and so forth and i'm just saying if anybody is out there on the west coast and you
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:30.360]  got kids playing on the beach and they think that'd be fun to go grab onto a couple of fish and
[03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:35.160]  stuff like that stay the hell out of the way because when the water comes back in uh you can
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:39.800]  kiss your kids goodbye i watch these kids get floated away on that wave and uh i've seen the footage
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:45.480]  as well god bless you uh richard great points and to be sarcastic again how dare him as a
[03:02:45.480 --> 03:02:50.520]  citizen have his own view and try to warn people there's government announcements to warn people
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:56.280]  you're not supposed to out there be calling into shows trying to warn people that's kind of vigilante
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:03.480]  isn't it isn't it bob shatman it certainly is it certainly is very shameful richard uh john and
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:08.280]  california probably another evil person john you even know how to talk that's against the law
[03:03:09.480 --> 03:03:12.920]  yeah and i also listen to the bill right every night before i go to bed so
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:20.200]  that's like satanic versus sorry i've been waking up in the last three weeks since all
[03:03:20.200 --> 03:03:25.400]  because of you you're an invaluable resource to america in humanity just keep doing what you're
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:31.880]  doing right two things abiotic oil and uh the bachan oil field i heard lindsay talk a little
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:36.840]  bit about sweet fruit and bachan oil field the limited research i've done granite and it's not
[03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:42.360]  enough to do what i'm saying justice but what i've seen is it's oil show in the bachan oil field
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:47.800]  no if you can have wendy expand on listen when you drill in those areas you may hit oil at eight or
[03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:55.640]  nine areas there's shale there's stuff down 15 000 feet there's there's multi levels in deep
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:04:01.640]  drilling they hit natural gas they hit oil deposits it depends on what they think the biggest load is
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:06.280]  that they're going for bob chappan you want to in the show explaining that to uh john
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:15.880]  well i think you've over uh over viewed it uh quickly and correctly and it's wherever they
[03:04:15.880 --> 03:04:24.120]  think they'll get the biggest payoff um i understand uh from subscribers that uh there's a lot of
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:33.000]  activity in out dakota right now and they're building tanks uh you know for usage for holding and um
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:38.600]  and uh halliburton and others are all over the oh yeah exactly what lindsay williams is saying
