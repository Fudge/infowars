[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:05.793]  Monteith now joins us and I'm thankful for him joining us and your calls are coming up as well.
[00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:08.334]  He's been in this fight for 30 plus years.
[00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:12.477]  He is a syndicated talk show host in his own right on many stations around the country.
[00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:16.560]  Does three or four different shows a day, one of them here on this network.
[00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:22.100]  And Dr. Monteith, it's great to have you on the show with us.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.787]  You have been studying some of the stuff that came out in the Senate Intelligence and House Intelligence Joint Committee whitewashes, and you found some interesting information.
[00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:37.105]  That we've heard about day one, but never any more details of, and it's great to have you here to expose this.
[00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:53.456]  Well, it really is fascinating, Alex, that Kristen Breitweiser testified before the Senate Select Committee on the 18th of September, and of course the reporters were there, the television cameras were grinding, and they totally ignored the very significant things she brought out.
[00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:54.477]  It was magnificent to
[00:00:54.497 --> 00:00:55.017]  That's a good question.
[00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:21.146]  I don't know.
[00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.321]  Well, Dr. Monteith, I mean, we buy that Goss has been pressured.
[00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:06.204]  I know that Newsweek story said that he didn't want to do it, but he has to block all investigations.
[00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:10.245]  And we know that Wellstone wasn't going along with that, and he had a little accident last week.
[00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:22.873]  At the same time, Porter, Gosch and Graham were meeting with the top Pakistani general, the admitted head of Taliban and Al-Qaeda, the guy that wired $100,000 to Mohammed Ata.
[00:02:22.873 --> 00:02:29.517]  They were meeting with him over a breakfast at 8.30 in the morning on September 11, according to the New York Times.
[00:02:29.517 --> 00:02:35.080]  So, they want to act like they're being pressured, but it's obvious that that's not actually the case.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.362]  Now, in this report, it talks about the Port Authority.
[00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:38.622]  We're good to go.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:04.707]  A sidebar to this, we have national security being declared at the federal level, the state blocking it, and the Port Authority blocking it, telling the firefighters they can't talk to the media, grabbing the transmission tapes of the firefighters in the buildings, reporting bombs going off.
[00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:07.969]  That much has been released in the New York Daily News and the New York Post.
[00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:19.535]  So why would the government be telling the firefighters you can't talk to the press, there's a gag order, and you can't release any of these transmission tapes or even video interviews that they did in depositions?
[00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:26.139]  I mean, this is a clear cover-up because of the bombs that were obviously there, also in Building 7, that didn't even have an aircraft hit it.
[00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.719]  Your take on that?
[00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.001]  Well, I believe that there's a lot we haven't gotten.
[00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.822]  And actually, we carry a video.
[00:03:31.822 --> 00:03:35.023]  It's called, A Great Deception, put up by my friend David Wagner.
[00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:41.407]  And you'll actually hear, you know, some of the firefighters talking about the explosions in the building.
[00:03:42.572 --> 00:03:43.433]  It really is.
[00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:44.233]  There's so much here.
[00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:55.920]  But you know, the significant thing about the story of the South Tower coming down, first of all, there was 11 minutes between the time that the North Tower was hit and the South Tower was hit.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.564]  And there was a gentleman, he was an ex-Marine, he was in charge of security for Morgan Stanley up on the top floor.
[00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:05.425]  And he knew that the terrorist attack was coming.
[00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:09.167]  He had to rescue an awful lot of people during the 1993 attack.
[00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:10.967]  He knew the attack was coming.
[00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:23.213]  And that morning, after when the first plane hit the North Tower, he went around with a bullhorn or a blowhorn there in Morgan Stanley, telling all 3,000 employees to get out.
[00:04:23.213 --> 00:04:25.894]  And of course, the Port Authority was saying, go back to your jobs.
[00:04:25.894 --> 00:04:30.536]  There's nothing to worry about, even though they knew another plane was headed to New York.
[00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:36.902]  Well, he got all but three of the over 3,000 employers of Morgan Stanley out of the building.
[00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:42.007]  Unfortunately, there were three of them still and he went back to get them and he died.
[00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:45.770]  But of course, he did exactly what he was told not to do.
[00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.774]  And all the people in that South Tower were told to stay at their jobs.
[00:04:50.154 --> 00:04:54.896]  Despite the fact that Port Authority knew the other hijacked plane was heading to New York.
[00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:56.977]  Now, this came out in Senate testimony.
[00:04:56.977 --> 00:05:02.839]  Tell the listeners who brought this testimony out and where they can find it online or in your powerful newsletter.
[00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:09.582]  The testimony was made by Stephen Pusch, but actually we have it in the interview we did with him, a couple of interviews we've done with him.
[00:05:09.582 --> 00:05:13.404]  They're available from us at 1-800-5-HIV-WAR.
[00:05:13.404 --> 00:05:18.446]  Stephen Pusch's testimony, however, is available from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
[00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:19.306]  Well, let's...
[00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:48.847]  She takes on Condoleezza Rice and she said, Condoleezza Rice said, you know, on the May 17th of this year, I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center.
[00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:53.671]  That they would try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile.
[00:05:54.011 --> 00:06:08.187]  And actually she had made that statement that they were going to do that even before and then Kristen actually goes through and lists all the evidence that there was that they knew ahead of time they were going to attack our buildings and specifically the World Trade Center.
[00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:09.348]  Do you want me to go through those things?
[00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:16.578]  In just a second, I just want to add that normally if there was even a bomb threat, they would evacuate both towers.
[00:06:16.578 --> 00:06:18.781]  They had been bracing for an attack the week before.
[00:06:18.781 --> 00:06:23.227]  The head of the firefighters union said that they knew an attack was coming that week.
[00:06:23.227 --> 00:06:24.308]  That's been an MSNBC.
[00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:35.629]  Uh, normally they would evacuate, but according to the first press reports, there are the loudspeakers of the Port Authority that controls the buildings saying, stay there, don't evacuate.
[00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:41.952]  I mean, we've got a building smoking next door, but they tell them, stay at your post, stay at your post.
[00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:50.456]  And then now we have the Port Authority blocking the firefighters and others releasing information, having the metal hauled away to Communist China to be smelted.
[00:06:51.562 --> 00:06:56.530]  The oldest firefighting organization in the country, firefighting engineering, says it's a cover-up.
[00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.353]  I mean, this is obvious.
[00:06:58.353 --> 00:07:01.458]  They told them to stay in there because they wanted a high death count.
[00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:16.400]  I hate to admit that I think you're absolutely right, Alex, and it's such a horrible thing really to contemplate, but we're dealing with evil people, and they needed that incident to get us into the war, the coming war in the Middle East.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.641]  This whole thing was scripted long, long ago.
[00:07:18.641 --> 00:07:20.703]  Why are we going to war with Iraq?
[00:07:20.703 --> 00:07:24.946]  Because 15 Saudi Arabians destroyed the World Trade Center.
[00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:27.267]  I mean, why are we going to war with Saudi Arabia?
[00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:35.852]  Why is the State Department doing everything they can to block the lawsuit with Saudi Arabia for a trillion dollars because they financed al-Qaeda?
[00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:38.593]  If they didn't finance it, it would all come out in the trial.
[00:07:38.593 --> 00:07:54.342]  But of course, they don't want the information to come out because it would not only tie in Saudi Arabia and many of the leading officials of Saudi Arabia with the al-Qaeda terrorists and Osama bin Laden, but it would lead right back to the highest officials in our own State Department and the executive branch of government.
[00:07:54.762 --> 00:08:01.130]  All right, Dr. Monteith, let's go over the players this September 18th meeting.
[00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:10.100]  What happened in that committee room in this vital testimony that's available with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence there at the Library of Congress online.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.765]  We're going to put a link to that today, by the way, on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:25.630]  Dr. Monteith, go over, you know, her quotes, what she said, what they went over, and this valiant Marine Corps veteran who got 3,000 plus shot, went back in to save three people, and died.
[00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.951]  Well, basically, let's go over what Kristen said.
[00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:34.754]  And she was replying to the statement by Condoleezza Rice that said, who could ever have, why we never could have imagined that.
[00:08:35.274 --> 00:08:37.536]  And here's what she points out.
[00:08:37.536 --> 00:08:46.262]  In 1993, a $150,000 study was commissioned by the Pentagon to investigate the possibility of an airplane being used to bomb national landmarks.
[00:08:46.262 --> 00:08:50.565]  A draft document of this was circulated throughout the Pentagon, the Justice Department, and FEMA.
[00:08:51.452 --> 00:09:01.040]  In 1994, a disgruntled FedEx employee invaded the cockpit of a DC-10 and planned to crash the plane into the company building in Memphis.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.565]  In 1994, a lone pilot crashed a small plane into a tree on the White House grounds.
[00:09:06.565 --> 00:09:12.730]  In 1994, an Air France flight was hijacked in Algiers by members of the armed Islamic group
[00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.892]  With the intent of crashing the plane into the Eiffel Tower.
[00:09:15.892 --> 00:09:24.138]  In January of 1995, Philippine authorities investigated Abdul Murad, an Islamic terrorist, and under Project Bachinka.
[00:09:24.138 --> 00:09:34.746]  And it's specifically stipulated that part of that was to crash the plane, hijack planes, and crash them into the CIA headquarters, the World Trade Center, the Sears Tower, and the White House.
[00:09:35.422 --> 00:09:42.024]  And then, of course, in 1997, this plot resurfaced during the trial of Ramsey Yosef in New York City.
[00:09:42.024 --> 00:09:49.626]  And again, FBI officials testified that the plan targeted not only the CIA building, but other U.S.
[00:09:49.626 --> 00:09:51.967]  government buildings in Washington, including the Pentagon.
[00:09:52.527 --> 00:10:01.171]  In September of 1999, a report put out entitled Sociology and Psychology of Terrorism was prepared for U.S.
[00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:17.059]  intelligence by Federal Research Division, an arm of the Library of Congress, and it stated that suicide bombers belonging to Al-Qaeda's Martinder Battalion could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the CIA, and the White House.
[00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:28.594]  And of course there were so many other references to using planes, hijacked planes crashing into our buildings, that when Condoleezza Wright said that we never could have imagined it, she was frankly lying.
[00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:36.500]  Well, we also have the Pentagon Protective Force, the District of Columbia Military Protection Force, in November.
[00:10:37.385 --> 00:10:51.815]  Uh, it was actually carried out in October, uh, the 26th or 28th, but in November 3rd, uh, on the Army Newswire, and we have this in the film, The Masters of Terror, the actual Pentagon News reports, where they practice flying jet airliners into the Pentagon itself.
[00:10:51.815 --> 00:11:02.683]  Then on September 11th, 8.30 in the morning, CIA Situation Center, uh, uh, A, the main structure, was doing a drill with a, uh, top official of the National Security Council,
[00:11:03.203 --> 00:11:04.083]  We're good to go.
[00:11:24.332 --> 00:11:36.986]  We have the Genoa, Italy operation a year before 9-1-1, where they have anti-aircraft guns on top of buildings, at the BBC and Associated Press articles with how they put rings of anti-aircraft missiles and guns all over Genoa.
[00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:38.568]  They're at the Economic Summit.
[00:11:38.568 --> 00:11:39.669]  We know this.
[00:11:39.669 --> 00:11:43.193]  We know they trained three of the hijackers at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[00:11:43.193 --> 00:11:44.595]  We know they funded them.
[00:11:44.595 --> 00:11:45.215]  We know that
[00:11:46.408 --> 00:11:52.150]  The Colonel of the Defense Language School was forced to train Muhammad Afta, one of the lead hijackers, and that's why he was angry.
[00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.850]  We know this was going on.
[00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.231]  Bottom line, Dr. Sam Monteith, we know the Rockefellers controlled the Port Authority there.
[00:11:58.231 --> 00:12:01.172]  We know they sold out to Silverstein two months before.
[00:12:01.172 --> 00:12:07.313]  We know the building seven houses CIA, the FBI, as well as the Federal Trade Commission documents.
[00:12:07.313 --> 00:12:09.294]  We know that building imploded in three seconds.
[00:12:09.694 --> 00:12:12.096]  I have the video of that, bombs going off.
[00:12:12.096 --> 00:12:21.363]  Bottom line, your analysis is 100% sure that they at least have prior knowledge and most of the evidence, all the evidence we see shows that they actually carried this out.
[00:12:21.363 --> 00:12:23.485]  Well, they certainly knew the attack was coming.
[00:12:23.485 --> 00:12:26.888]  In fact, you can go back and read the New World Coming report.
[00:12:26.888 --> 00:12:34.113]  We have it available, it's up on the internet, put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, 12 of the 14 members were that.
[00:12:34.113 --> 00:12:34.914]  That was the National
[00:12:36.094 --> 00:12:47.038]  By the way, have you seen the new report where they say that 80 plus percent casualties in the U.S.
[00:12:47.038 --> 00:12:52.120]  in major cities if we don't follow their recommendations in the new report put out last Thursday?
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:13:00.523]  In that report it says total fascist control of everything, 007 license to kill power to the CFR, total troops on the streets.
[00:13:00.523 --> 00:13:01.363]  Have you read that yet?
[00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:02.844]  No, where is that report Alex?
[00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:03.404]  I haven't seen that.
[00:13:03.704 --> 00:13:05.665]  I'll go to CFR.org.
[00:13:05.665 --> 00:13:07.106]  It's their Phase 4 report.
[00:13:07.106 --> 00:13:07.887]  It's the new report.
[00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:10.228]  I'll dig it out and give you the actual title here in a second.
[00:13:10.228 --> 00:13:12.290]  Okay, I think that's really very important.
[00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.932]  I assume this is the same commission than the National Commission?
[00:13:14.932 --> 00:13:18.154]  Yeah, it's the Gary Hart-Rudman Council on Foreign Relations Commission.
[00:13:18.154 --> 00:13:20.015]  Oh, we've got to get that one.
[00:13:20.015 --> 00:13:22.457]  Let me read the headline for you.
[00:13:22.457 --> 00:13:23.958]  America's still unprepared.
[00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.399]  America's still in danger.
[00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:29.201]  Report on an independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:30.982]  Gary Hart and Warren Rudman co-chairs.
[00:13:30.982 --> 00:13:33.264]  Stephen E. Flynn, project director.
[00:13:34.044 --> 00:13:36.405]  And then it's a 40-plus page document.
[00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:37.285]  Go ahead.
[00:13:37.285 --> 00:13:37.826]  All right, fine.
[00:13:37.826 --> 00:14:01.134]  Well, of course, I'm sure your listeners know that on September 14th, just three days after the attack, Gary Hart was actually addressing the members of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., and he said, there is a chance the President of the United States can use this disaster to bring about what his father discussed, and I think it was only once, and that is a new world order.
[00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:03.755]  They can use this disaster.
[00:14:03.755 --> 00:14:05.215]  We actually have that on film.
[00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:07.536]  It's in a film called A Great Deception.
[00:14:07.536 --> 00:14:10.216]  And you'll actually see Gary Hart saying that.
[00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:13.177]  Talk about crass disregard for human suffering.
[00:14:13.177 --> 00:14:14.257]  That's what it's all about.
[00:14:14.257 --> 00:14:17.478]  It's to use this disaster to create the New World Order.
[00:14:17.478 --> 00:14:20.159]  And of course, to do that, they're going to get us into a war in the Middle East.
[00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:22.570]  Absolutely.
[00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.630]  Stay right there, Dr. Mond.
[00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.851]  People, come back and talk to Ken in Tennessee and others.
[00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:27.932]  Your chance to chime in and get involved.
[00:14:27.932 --> 00:14:41.057]  Does this outrage you that the Port Authority was saying, stay at your post, stay in the buildings, stay in the buildings, when normally they'd evacuate them for a simple bomb threat, while buildings smoking, they're saying, stay in the buildings.
[00:14:41.057 --> 00:14:42.438]  This is America, folks.
[00:14:42.438 --> 00:14:44.959]  Now, what are you going to do to expose these murderers?
[00:14:46.514 --> 00:14:51.900]  This communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:56.084]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:14:56.084 --> 00:14:57.826]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:57.826 --> 00:14:58.687]  Welcome back.
[00:14:58.687 --> 00:15:00.249]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:06.877]  Dr. Monteith was just talking about those ominous statements by the globalists.
[00:15:06.877 --> 00:15:08.238]  Here's Bush at the U.N.
[00:15:08.238 --> 00:15:10.499]  saying, don't tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[00:15:10.499 --> 00:15:13.482]  Yeah, he better hope that we don't tolerate what they've done.
[00:15:13.482 --> 00:15:25.071]  Then we've got Gary Hart at the CFR, and then his daddy, because I'm going to air this one more time, and these clips, the video of this, is all in the Road to Territory premiere film covering September 11th.
[00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:31.036]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th.
[00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:38.421]  Malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves, away from the guilty.
[00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:52.867]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father, a phrase his father used I think only once, and hasn't been used since, and that is a New World Order.
[00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:58.850]  What is at stake is more than one small country.
[00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.211]  It is a big idea.
[00:16:01.383 --> 00:16:12.512]  A new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind.
[00:16:12.512 --> 00:16:18.637]  Peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law.
[00:16:18.637 --> 00:16:25.923]  Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective, a new world order, can emerge.
[00:16:25.923 --> 00:16:28.605]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[00:16:29.844 --> 00:16:34.630]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order?
[00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:48.186]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, and if you want The Road to Tyranny or my new film, The Masters of Terror, that's part two to that, just go to InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net or call toll-free 1-888.
[00:16:50.299 --> 00:16:50.499]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:16:50.499 --> 00:16:51.220]  That's 8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.884]  The films are $25.95 apiece, over two hours apiece.
[00:16:53.884 --> 00:16:56.568]  If you order three or more, they drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:17:06.483 --> 00:17:25.689]  Again, toll free number 1-888-253-3139 or Infowars.com or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:26.970]  Get the films today.
[00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:27.990]  Let's go to Ken in Tennessee.
[00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.431]  We're going to hold Dr. Monteith, of course, over 30 minutes into the next hour.
[00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:32.431]  You're on the air, Ken.
[00:17:32.431 --> 00:17:34.132]  Go ahead with Dr. Shan Monteith, our guest.
[00:17:35.003 --> 00:17:36.063]  Can you hear me, Alex?
[00:17:36.063 --> 00:17:37.204]  Yes, I can, sir.
[00:17:37.204 --> 00:17:37.784]  All right.
[00:17:37.784 --> 00:17:41.765]  Well, good afternoon, Dr. Monteith, Alex.
[00:17:41.765 --> 00:17:47.887]  Alex, I wanted to ask you before I get on the subject, are you going to be able to attend the Expo in Atlanta next year?
[00:17:47.887 --> 00:17:49.147]  No, I'm not going to be attending.
[00:17:49.147 --> 00:17:51.968]  I told Clay that, I think, about three weeks ago.
[00:17:51.968 --> 00:17:56.389]  I wasn't sure earlier, and I said tentative I might be able to, but I won't be able to attend that.
[00:17:56.389 --> 00:17:56.709]  Okay.
[00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:57.870]  Well, sorry to hear that.
[00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.770]  We'll miss you.
[00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.091]  Anyway, it sounds as though that
[00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:09.750]  The two gentlemen agree with me and are not very satisfied with our corporate CEO and our board members.
[00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.733]  I'm referring to George Bush, our Congress, and our Senate.
[00:18:13.733 --> 00:18:21.960]  The thing about it is, earlier you were talking with Ken and Tex about the elections and voting.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.783]  I've removed myself from the voting rolls.
[00:18:25.783 --> 00:18:29.886]  The fact is that a corporation cannot be a government, so we don't have a government.
[00:18:30.262 --> 00:18:32.946]  And this goes right down to the local level.
[00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.591]  They've all incorporated.
[00:18:35.591 --> 00:18:37.514]  Dr. Montee, would you like to comment on that?
[00:18:40.011 --> 00:18:40.951]  To be involved.
[00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:42.252]  Certainly they're corrupt.
[00:18:42.252 --> 00:18:45.373]  They take advantage of the voting situation.
[00:18:45.373 --> 00:18:54.775]  But the plan is, basically what they're going to do is take over all the local governments and then have them carry out the policies of the international ruling elite.
[00:18:54.775 --> 00:18:56.456]  So you need to be involved.
[00:18:56.456 --> 00:18:59.297]  At least try it with your own local community.
[00:18:59.297 --> 00:19:01.057]  Have some good responsible people there.
[00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:03.238]  If you give up, they win.
[00:19:03.238 --> 00:19:06.219]  Certainly I get very discouraged, especially living in California.
[00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:11.421]  When we've got poor Governor Tweedledum and Tweedledee, we've got bad and worse running.
[00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:12.761]  We've got to break, Dr. Monteith.
[00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:14.802]  You have to be involved.
[00:19:14.802 --> 00:19:16.702]  Any final comments, Ken?
[00:19:16.702 --> 00:19:22.164]  Well, the basic bottom line is they have already taken over our government at all levels.
[00:19:22.164 --> 00:19:32.948]  The fact is that I'm not going to participate in voting for criminal A, B, or C. So you're saying playing along with it only encourages them, but I think what Dr. Monteith is saying is they don't have total control yet.
[00:19:32.948 --> 00:19:34.148]  Maybe they do in your area, Ken.
[00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:43.425]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:19:43.425 --> 00:19:47.928]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:47.928 --> 00:19:51.851]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:19:51.851 --> 00:19:52.991]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:56.714]  Already into the third and final hour of this Friday broadcast.
[00:19:56.714 --> 00:19:58.795]  Again, thanks for joining us today.
[00:19:58.795 --> 00:20:01.237]  Infowars.net and com are the websites.
[00:20:01.237 --> 00:20:04.999]  We're talking to Dr. Stan Monteith, a good friend of mine, has his own show here on this network.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.380]  And we've got some calls coming up, too.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:13.082]  Your chance to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:13.082 --> 00:20:18.003]  Just recapping, in Senate testimony, it turns out that what we first heard was true.
[00:20:18.003 --> 00:20:23.765]  The Port Authority told people to stay in the buildings, especially right after the first building was hit.
[00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:27.226]  They said, stay there, stay there, stay there, announcing it over the loudspeakers.
[00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:30.487]  A young, well, not too young now, but a former Marine,
[00:20:32.329 --> 00:20:41.077]  They're head of security for one of the big organizations, Thomas Bullhorn, and got 3,000 people out and went back in to save others, and it collapsed and killed him.
[00:20:41.077 --> 00:20:43.079]  It's outrageous information.
[00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:44.461]  It's disgusting.
[00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:45.982]  Dr. Monteith, what should happen?
[00:20:45.982 --> 00:20:51.908]  We should have the people in the port authority that did this should be indicted, but I guess the grand juries in New York are totally corrupt.
[00:20:52.398 --> 00:20:54.600]  Well, I think what we have to do is get the truth out.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.563]  What we need is an independent investigation.
[00:20:56.563 --> 00:21:02.949]  First of all, we need to get people to understand that the White House is doing everything they can to prevent an investigation.
[00:21:02.949 --> 00:21:05.912]  If there's nothing to conceal, then why are they concealing it?
[00:21:05.912 --> 00:21:10.778]  They're using the tragedy of what happened on September 11th last year to get us into
[00:21:11.622 --> 00:21:12.804]  World War III.
[00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:17.372]  What the American people have to understand is they're going to lose everything if they don't get involved.
[00:21:17.372 --> 00:21:21.239]  And they certainly need to get your material, and I recommend it strongly.
[00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:24.425]  I think that Road to Tyranny is an excellent, excellent video.
[00:21:25.234 --> 00:21:35.303]  And of course, if they'd like to get a copy of my last newsletter, that's the October newsletter, that has the entire text of Kristen Breitweiser's testimony in it.
[00:21:35.303 --> 00:21:36.304]  Give us a call at 1-800-544-8927.
[00:21:36.304 --> 00:21:40.888]  That's 1-800-5-HIV-WAR.
[00:21:40.888 --> 00:21:41.608]  Copy these.
[00:21:41.608 --> 00:21:43.350]  Copy Alex's videos.
[00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.170]  Get them out.
[00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.373]  Copy Kristen Breitweiser's testimony.
[00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:48.474]  Get people to read.
[00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:50.536]  It's a touching, emotional testimony.
[00:21:51.036 --> 00:21:56.319]  And when the American people are willing to take a stand and march by the millions to Washington D.C.
[00:21:56.319 --> 00:22:02.642]  demanding an independent investigation and the impeachment of the President, at that point we can begin to take America back.
[00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:09.076]  Well, those are serious comments, but that's the bare minimum that should be done.
[00:22:09.076 --> 00:22:10.856]  I heartily agree with you.
[00:22:10.856 --> 00:22:13.377]  What do you see happening in this new war?
[00:22:13.377 --> 00:22:15.598]  You know, the CFR says look for 80% of U.S.
[00:22:15.598 --> 00:22:16.698]  cities to be killed.
[00:22:16.698 --> 00:22:18.319]  We don't give our rights up to them.
[00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:28.283]  They call for the CFR to be given highest level national security clearances for their corporations to be able to carry out military intelligence operations here domestically.
[00:22:28.283 --> 00:22:32.004]  This is in their new report that came out last week that I've been covering all week.
[00:22:32.664 --> 00:22:34.365]  They call for troops on the streets.
[00:22:34.365 --> 00:22:37.446]  I mean, look, troops on the streets don't protect you from Al-Qaeda.
[00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:39.187]  They oppress general populations.
[00:22:39.187 --> 00:22:39.707]  Absolutely.
[00:22:39.707 --> 00:22:46.669]  In fact, they're talking about mobilizing a quarter of a million National Guard people because, oh, we're going to get attacked if we go to war with Saddam Hussein.
[00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:51.791]  Well, if that's true, then why don't we just give up the idea of going to war with Saddam Hussein?
[00:22:51.791 --> 00:23:01.395]  He's not going to attack America unless we attack him, because he knows all we would do would be to drop a nuclear bomb on him, and that'd be the end of Baghdad and the end of Saddam Hussein.
[00:23:02.215 --> 00:23:09.181]  What they are doing, of course, is provoking this war to get a counter-response to justify a dictatorship in America.
[00:23:09.181 --> 00:23:12.203]  Well, they'll just say it's a counter-response.
[00:23:12.203 --> 00:23:16.687]  We know those Iraqis involved in the Oklahoma City bombing work for the Globalist, not for Saddam.
[00:23:16.687 --> 00:23:18.689]  Absolutely, in fact.
[00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:23.733]  Another thing we need to do is demand to see the videos that were taken in front of the Murrah Building.
[00:23:24.193 --> 00:23:25.454]  On April 19th of 1995.
[00:23:25.454 --> 00:23:29.699]  They say we can't show him to you because of national security.
[00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:34.283]  Well, are we afraid that Timothy McVeigh is going to find out who was in the truck with him?
[00:23:34.283 --> 00:23:39.488]  Are we afraid that Terry Nichols is going to find out who was in that terrorist truck?
[00:23:39.488 --> 00:23:43.472]  Well, we know who the CIA... Right, they're afraid the American people are going to find out.
[00:23:44.301 --> 00:23:48.285]  Well, the CIA op, and they are in the news saying Iraq was involved in the bombing.
[00:23:48.285 --> 00:23:51.407]  People don't ask, though, why don't they release those surveillance camera tapes?
[00:23:51.407 --> 00:23:55.811]  Why did Clinton order the release of five of the Iraqis that were arrested?
[00:23:55.811 --> 00:24:01.796]  Well, I think that the American people have to understand, we are moving into the final phase of consolidation of power.
[00:24:01.796 --> 00:24:04.559]  And if they do nothing, then they have nothing to worry about.
[00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:08.302]  But men and women become accomplices to evils they fail to oppose.
[00:24:08.302 --> 00:24:10.204]  And what are they going to say when their children are dying?
[00:24:11.682 --> 00:24:12.503]  Absolutely.
[00:24:12.503 --> 00:24:15.224]  The cost will be more than you want to pay if you don't get involved.
[00:24:15.224 --> 00:24:17.645]  When you do have power, you can't affect change.
[00:24:17.645 --> 00:24:20.066]  We've seen that renaissance happening, the awakening.
[00:24:20.066 --> 00:24:21.027]  Your call is coming up.
[00:24:21.027 --> 00:24:26.189]  More with Dr. Stan Monteith and a ton of news stories right here in the next 55 minutes in this third hour.
[00:24:26.189 --> 00:24:26.629]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:26.629 --> 00:24:27.970]  Again, it's five minutes after the hour.
[00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:28.010]  800-259-9231.
[00:24:35.425 --> 00:24:38.206]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:42.947]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:42.947 --> 00:24:44.607]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:44.607 --> 00:24:45.648]  Welcome back.
[00:24:45.648 --> 00:24:47.848]  Your calls and a ton of news coming up.
[00:24:47.848 --> 00:24:50.729]  Do you have any questions or comments for myself or our guests?
[00:24:50.729 --> 00:25:02.112]  Dr. Sam Monteith about the New World Order, about the systems, about the Council on Foreign Relations setting race in their new report for massive 80% plus death tolls in major cities if we don't give up all our rights.
[00:25:02.112 --> 00:25:02.812]  If we do, only 20%.
[00:25:04.275 --> 00:25:07.618]  Dr. Monteith, for those that don't know, what is the CFR?
[00:25:07.618 --> 00:25:09.239]  What is the New World Order?
[00:25:09.239 --> 00:25:10.100]  What is its aims?
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.181]  What is its goals?
[00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:17.025]  Well, the CFR is the American extension of a secret society that was created in 1891 by Cecil Rhodes.
[00:25:17.025 --> 00:25:27.214]  Now, if you want to get the background of that, it's covered in a book called Tragedy and Hope in the History of the World in Our Time, written by Professor Carol Quigley, who was Bill Clifton's mentor.
[00:25:27.814 --> 00:25:34.557]  A liberal college historian who taught at both Harvard and Princeton before he went to Georgetown University.
[00:25:34.557 --> 00:25:47.182]  Professor Quigley had discovered this secret society when he was over in England in the late 1940s from Professor Zimmer, who was actually a member of the secret society and Professor Quigley spent 20 years studying it.
[00:25:47.182 --> 00:25:55.505]  If you get his book, Tragedy and Hope, incidentally, which we carry through our ministry, on pages 951 and 952, you'll find that the Council on Foreign Relations
[00:25:56.085 --> 00:25:56.826]  We're good to go.
[00:26:11.986 --> 00:26:13.306]  Uh, in the hands of a few.
[00:26:13.306 --> 00:26:14.087]  That's right.
[00:26:14.087 --> 00:26:15.007]  That's right.
[00:26:15.007 --> 00:26:18.548]  And they confuse us with terms like communist, fascist, socialist.
[00:26:18.548 --> 00:26:19.848]  It's all command and control.
[00:26:19.848 --> 00:26:23.969]  It's world feudalism, serfdom, and the definition of feudalism and serfdom.
[00:26:23.969 --> 00:26:25.350]  Why don't you tell them about that?
[00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:37.573]  Well, of course, the whole idea, uh, basically, uh, and Professor Quigley brought this up, you know, he said, you know, these crazy Americans, uh, they think that the real enemy is the left, uh, the Harvard University, Yale University, uh, the, uh,
[00:26:38.033 --> 00:26:39.074]  But they don't understand.
[00:26:39.074 --> 00:26:41.517]  They think it's the communist influence.
[00:26:41.517 --> 00:26:44.059]  He said it's not the communist influence at all.
[00:26:44.059 --> 00:26:50.706]  It's the Anglo-American establishment which is behind this whole thing that most people imagine is communism.
[00:26:50.706 --> 00:26:53.829]  And what people don't understand is they created communism.
[00:26:53.829 --> 00:26:55.090]  They financed communism.
[00:26:56.231 --> 00:26:57.411]  Let me add a point to that.
[00:26:57.411 --> 00:26:57.912]  You know, feudalism
[00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:20.212]  We're good.
[00:27:36.981 --> 00:27:38.362]  And this is desperate, folks.
[00:27:38.362 --> 00:27:41.784]  I mean, they plan a total control grid.
[00:27:41.784 --> 00:27:46.928]  Dr. Monteith, I'm sure you've heard about Denver, and now Arlington saying ordering the stores.
[00:27:46.928 --> 00:27:48.969]  It's no law that you should order them to do it.
[00:27:48.969 --> 00:27:54.793]  Put thumb scanners in for folks to buy and sell the satellite tracking systems going in the cars.
[00:27:54.793 --> 00:27:56.875]  It's starting to happen.
[00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.556]  How fast do you see all this coming down?
[00:27:58.556 --> 00:28:00.977]  It's coming down like a freight train on a track.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.643]  It's happening at the fastest rate I've ever seen in my lifetime, and I've been studying this for 40 years.
[00:28:09.643 --> 00:28:22.172]  But as far as the feudalism is concerned, you get Professor Quigley's book, and here's a liberal college historian, Bill Clinton's mentor, and he's in on pages 324, the whole idea is to establish a feudal system
[00:28:22.712 --> 00:28:24.993]  Well, let me read a quote here by Professor Carol Quigley.
[00:28:24.993 --> 00:28:26.693]  And again, I have this excerpt in my book, Dissent and Deterring.
[00:28:26.693 --> 00:28:27.334]  It says,
[00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:51.420]  We're good to go.
[00:29:08.553 --> 00:29:16.839]  Uh, of the operations of this network because I have studied it for 20 years and was permitted for two years in the early 60s to examine its papers and secret records.
[00:29:16.839 --> 00:29:23.625]  I have no aversion to it or most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments.
[00:29:24.185 --> 00:29:36.054]  I have objected both in the past and recently to a few of its policies, but in general, my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.
[00:29:36.054 --> 00:29:39.396]  Professor Carol Quigley in his book, Tragedy and Hope, 1966.
[00:29:39.396 --> 00:29:41.938]  Page 950, and that's absolutely right.
[00:29:41.938 --> 00:29:43.159]  That is such an important
[00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:46.441]  Quotation, I wish every American could get a copy of the book.
[00:29:46.441 --> 00:29:48.763]  We, incidentally, do carry it through our ministry.
[00:29:48.763 --> 00:29:51.004]  Get it, read it, get other people to read it.
[00:29:51.004 --> 00:29:52.665]  That is the very essence.
[00:29:52.665 --> 00:29:55.387]  Are you guys carrying Dr. Dissent the tyranny yet?
[00:29:55.387 --> 00:29:56.128]  I know you wanted to.
[00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:56.868]  Have we gotten you some?
[00:29:56.868 --> 00:29:57.689]  We need to.
[00:29:57.689 --> 00:30:01.491]  Oh, I have the dissent... No, I don't have the dissent the tyranny.
[00:30:01.491 --> 00:30:05.034]  I have the first... I have the first... No, wait a minute.
[00:30:05.034 --> 00:30:07.155]  You have the book, but you were saying you wanted to carry the book.
[00:30:07.155 --> 00:30:08.216]  I need to send you some.
[00:30:08.516 --> 00:30:11.517]  Yes, and no, I haven't, and we really do want to carry it.
[00:30:11.517 --> 00:30:13.518]  Chris, I've got to get you back on my program again.
[00:30:13.518 --> 00:30:14.839]  Well, what did you think of this, Senator?
[00:30:14.839 --> 00:30:16.960]  Because you're an author and have been doing this longer than I have.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.260]  I think you did a great job.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.461]  I really do.
[00:30:19.461 --> 00:30:21.141]  And we need to have the information.
[00:30:21.141 --> 00:30:27.804]  And what I liked about it specifically was you told people where to go, where to go on the web to get the verification for what you were saying.
[00:30:27.804 --> 00:30:34.887]  Because, you know, for the average person to believe that people in government could have known the attack was coming and left those people there to die?
[00:30:35.447 --> 00:30:39.969]  Well, that's unthinkable and yet that's exactly what happened.
[00:30:39.969 --> 00:30:42.150]  Now, Dr. Monteith, an important question here.
[00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.872]  You've been studying him again on the air for 37 years and studying him for 40 years.
[00:30:47.399 --> 00:30:49.081]  The Globalist.
[00:30:49.081 --> 00:30:51.503]  What is the top people in the power structure?
[00:30:51.503 --> 00:30:55.066]  We know it's Dutch Roll family, British Roll family, Rockefellers, Rothschilds.
[00:30:55.066 --> 00:30:58.930]  There's just a few hundred families, a few top families, a few dozen top families.
[00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:05.556]  But people say, oh, they're fighting amongst themselves, or they're jockeying for control, they're arguing over who gets the Iraqi oil.
[00:31:05.556 --> 00:31:07.818]  At the top, how many families are we dealing with here?
[00:31:08.379 --> 00:31:10.380]  Well, I think, I don't know.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:19.222]  I suspect we have probably half a dozen people, but behind that is this force of Satan, which is really intent upon creating the one world government.
[00:31:19.222 --> 00:31:24.504]  For those that deny that, every time, just in a secular study of the elite, they are obsessed with the occult.
[00:31:24.984 --> 00:31:25.744]  Right.
[00:31:25.744 --> 00:31:50.511]  And of course, you can tie the Rockefeller family into the occult, you can tie the British royal family into the occult, and the more you study this, the more you become aware of the fact that although we talk about politics, we talk about ideals, we talk about culture wars, this is really a spiritual battle, and it's an eternal battle between God and Satan that's being fought out today, and most of our ministers don't even understand what's going on.
[00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:53.283]  Well, absolutely.
[00:31:53.283 --> 00:31:54.705]  How soon do you see it coming down?
[00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:58.190]  I mean, do you think the globalists really have the nerve, as they've been saying, will happen?
[00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:04.378]  That the globalists attack Iraq, then the globalists claim Iraq attacks us, and then we have total police state.
[00:32:04.378 --> 00:32:08.503]  I mean, it seems like 9-1-1 was only the primer for the next mood takeover.
[00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:12.640]  Well, I think things are going to really proceed at a tremendous rate.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.401]  And then we're going to have a financial collapse in this country.
[00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:19.462]  We're on the edge of just a total economic meltdown.
[00:32:19.462 --> 00:32:21.663]  Now, I was on your show about a year ago, two years ago.
[00:32:21.663 --> 00:32:23.263]  You said, oh, I don't think that's coming yet.
[00:32:23.263 --> 00:32:24.544]  And now you're saying that.
[00:32:24.544 --> 00:32:25.084]  I see them.
[00:32:25.084 --> 00:32:26.364]  You saw the World Bank documents.
[00:32:26.364 --> 00:32:28.545]  Those are in the dissent to tyranny.
[00:32:28.545 --> 00:32:32.766]  But I interviewed Greg Palast and the chief at the World Bank quit.
[00:32:32.766 --> 00:32:35.247]  Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner, said, I won't be part of this.
[00:32:35.247 --> 00:32:38.008]  Their own documents say they want to blow out our economies.
[00:32:38.188 --> 00:32:43.794]  I think it's absolutely true, and I think as things get worse and worse, we'll see what happened during the 1930s, everybody will look to the government and say, you do something.
[00:32:57.868 --> 00:33:09.501]  Rather than realize that the government created the Great Depression in the 1930s and it's creating the financial collapse that we're going to see here, and I believe probably within the next six to nine months.
[00:33:09.501 --> 00:33:11.423]  Now, you weren't saying that a few years ago.
[00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:12.925]  None of us want to believe that.
[00:33:12.925 --> 00:33:14.106]  Why are you saying that?
[00:33:14.106 --> 00:33:16.869]  Well, very simply, because all the evidence is in.
[00:33:18.656 --> 00:33:20.677]  We see what's happened in Argentina.
[00:33:20.677 --> 00:33:24.959]  We find that certainly Europe is going into recession.
[00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:30.281]  There's been absolutely no growth in the economy of France or Germany this last year.
[00:33:30.281 --> 00:33:31.762]  Japan is the basket case.
[00:33:31.762 --> 00:33:34.323]  That's the second largest economy in the world.
[00:33:34.323 --> 00:33:39.485]  Even here in California, which is the sixth largest economy, we are on the brink of bankruptcy.
[00:33:39.485 --> 00:33:40.986]  And this was all done on purpose.
[00:33:41.446 --> 00:33:45.049]  Buy NAFTA and get out, which they promised us would mean milk and honey in the streets.
[00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.970]  Yeah, of course.
[00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.694]  You would think that after they've lied to us so often, people might be in disrespect.
[00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:51.675]  They're still lying to us.
[00:33:51.675 --> 00:33:54.898]  Well, we have their own World Bank documents.
[00:33:54.898 --> 00:34:00.984]  We have their own documents where they explain that they want to blow economies out so they can buy it up in pennies on the dollar.
[00:34:02.179 --> 00:34:03.040]  And they're going to do it.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.523]  This is exactly what they're doing over in Japan now.
[00:34:05.523 --> 00:34:08.386]  They're buying property there, 20 cents on the dollar.
[00:34:08.386 --> 00:34:09.867]  And of course, who's buying it up?
[00:34:09.867 --> 00:34:13.391]  Why, a major American corporation is over there scooping it up.
[00:34:13.391 --> 00:34:18.516]  But one of these days, people are going to find out that the dollars they're paying with have no value.
[00:34:18.516 --> 00:34:20.138]  They've been created out of thin air.
[00:34:21.332 --> 00:34:26.419]  And that's really one of the big things I learned from Professor Quigley and he makes that point over and over again.
[00:34:26.419 --> 00:34:29.724]  Banks create money out of nothing and then they charge the interest on them.
[00:34:29.724 --> 00:34:36.754]  But the day of consequences is coming and it's going to be time to pay the piper.
[00:34:37.154 --> 00:34:42.879]  And, you know, it's like you have about 30 people playing musical chairs and you've only got 5 chairs there.
[00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:47.642]  Everybody has borrowed money, they've got this tremendous debt they've accumulated.
[00:34:47.642 --> 00:34:52.346]  But when the music stops, only 5 people are going to be on the chairs and you're going to have 25 people on the chairs.
[00:34:52.346 --> 00:34:54.908]  And they're also talking about getting rid of greenbacks.
[00:34:54.908 --> 00:34:59.331]  The colored money comes out in the 20s and in other denominations over the next year and a half.
[00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:00.112]  This is developing.
[00:35:00.112 --> 00:35:02.754]  They're talking about calling in the old greenbacks.
[00:35:02.754 --> 00:35:06.897]  So even if you had money in a mattress, you won't be able to physically pay off your debts.
[00:35:07.117 --> 00:35:16.022]  No, I think that's true, but I really think the reason that they want to do that is because they've got people all over the world who are holding greenbacks as their means of storage of wealth.
[00:35:16.022 --> 00:35:25.027]  And what they're going to do is, one of these days, they're going to say, sorry, folks, you've got, you know, all these hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars of greenbacks.
[00:35:25.027 --> 00:35:27.568]  Why, unless you have the colored money, your money is of no worth.
[00:35:27.748 --> 00:35:33.970]  You've got to trade that in for the new globalized standard, which they say the Amaro and the EU notes are to be merged in.
[00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:46.433]  So out of the economic crisis, coupled with terrorism going on to have the police state interface the local level to oppress the people, they bring us into this new world order, a world currency, a world leader.
[00:35:46.433 --> 00:35:47.493]  It's developing.
[00:35:47.493 --> 00:35:48.213]  It certainly is.
[00:35:48.213 --> 00:35:52.434]  But I think really what's going to happen is most people are going to be wiped out financially.
[00:35:52.434 --> 00:35:54.535]  Most people do not understand finances.
[00:35:55.035 --> 00:35:59.557]  They honestly believe there's security in annuities and CDs and in bonds.
[00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:04.639]  Those are all certificates of guaranteed confiscation and impoverishment.
[00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:11.441]  I think we're going to see the same thing in America that we've seen in this last year in Argentina with the destruction of the middle class.
[00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:18.887]  All right, Dr. Monteith, let's come back and talk to Spencer Lewis and others that are patiently holding your chance on Stranger Calls.
[00:36:18.887 --> 00:36:22.530]  When we get back, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.131]  It's scary stuff, but it is the facts.
[00:36:25.131 --> 00:36:26.993]  The World Bank's own documents.
[00:36:26.993 --> 00:36:29.854]  So remember, we told you who did it to you.
[00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:38.020]  The same men in black ski masks that are claiming they love you.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.641]  All right, folks, I got a
[00:36:40.299 --> 00:36:41.180]  We're back live.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.601]  Welcome.
[00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:48.185]  Final segment with our guest and I've got a bunch of news on a plethora of issues coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:36:48.185 --> 00:36:52.548]  Dr. Stan Monteith, our guest, will give you his contact info here in a few minutes.
[00:36:52.548 --> 00:36:54.270]  Right now, Spencer in Ohio.
[00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.071]  Thanks for holding in Lewis and others.
[00:36:56.071 --> 00:36:57.012]  Spencer, you're on the air.
[00:36:57.012 --> 00:36:58.052]  Go ahead.
[00:36:58.052 --> 00:36:59.033]  Hi, Dr. Stan.
[00:36:59.033 --> 00:37:00.834]  I'd like to say because H.G.
[00:37:00.834 --> 00:37:09.541]  Wells said history is a race between education and catastrophe, I'd like to ask the doctor if he thinks that former President Carter got the Nobel Peace Prize
[00:37:10.422 --> 00:37:15.727]  Was this because he signed in the 1948 Genocide Convention Treaty of 1977?
[00:37:15.727 --> 00:37:20.192]  And isn't that the same prize that Wilson got in 1919?
[00:37:20.192 --> 00:37:25.417]  And thirdly, who are the three unidentified naked beings on the flip side of that coin?
[00:37:25.417 --> 00:37:26.418]  Is that the Rothschilds?
[00:37:27.282 --> 00:37:28.763]  Oh, what coin are you speaking of?
[00:37:28.763 --> 00:37:31.344]  The Nobel Peace Prize that Mr. Carter received.
[00:37:31.344 --> 00:37:33.045]  I can't, I can't answer that.
[00:37:33.045 --> 00:37:38.587]  I will tell you that Jimmy Carter got the Nobel Peace Prize because it's given to people of a very liberal bent.
[00:37:38.587 --> 00:37:40.148]  It's given to murderers like coffee and ham.
[00:37:44.385 --> 00:37:47.367]  Trilateral Commission, he was a member of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:37:47.367 --> 00:37:49.788]  He was David Rockefeller's protege.
[00:37:49.788 --> 00:37:56.952]  And, you know, when they give the Nobel Peace Prize to people like Martin Luther King and others, and Winston Churchill, they're all part of the establishment.
[00:37:56.952 --> 00:38:02.215]  Of course, Martin Luther King paid very, very dearly, you know, for his Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:38:02.215 --> 00:38:04.156]  He became a liability, and so they killed him.
[00:38:04.156 --> 00:38:05.197]  That's just the way it was.
[00:38:05.197 --> 00:38:08.859]  Well, now it's gotten ridiculous with coffee and an en masse murderer.
[00:38:08.859 --> 00:38:13.262]  I mean, even Tiffany McKinney, who's a liberal, you know, black politician, said it's like, you know, giving
[00:38:14.122 --> 00:38:17.405]  They certainly cheapened this whole idea of the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:29.811]  In War of the Worlds, H.G.
[00:38:29.811 --> 00:38:33.473]  Wells suggested aliens and man descended from once identical beings.
[00:38:33.473 --> 00:38:36.154]  I certainly hope I didn't descend from the Rothschilds.
[00:38:36.154 --> 00:38:39.776]  Well, I hope that, uh, I think you have to understand that H.G.
[00:38:39.776 --> 00:38:45.620]  Wells was a very mixed-up man, and when he died, you know, he had a sense of total futility.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:53.184]  In the last book he has, you know, you have this feeling that, I think it was the end of a string or the end of a tether or something like that.
[00:38:53.184 --> 00:38:55.125]  He realized his whole life had been wasted.
[00:38:55.831 --> 00:39:00.333]  Yeah, and the picture of the Webster's has an interesting mark on his forehead, too.
[00:39:00.333 --> 00:39:00.973]  All right, thanks.
[00:39:00.973 --> 00:39:03.395]  Thanks for the call, Spencer.
[00:39:03.395 --> 00:39:08.877]  You know what Spencer's talking about is all the occult symbols all over everything and the bizarreness of it.
[00:39:08.877 --> 00:39:10.418]  Lewis in California, you're on the air.
[00:39:10.418 --> 00:39:12.019]  Go ahead, Lewis.
[00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:13.239]  Yes, gentlemen.
[00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:23.364]  In your summation there, both of you kind of made your statements about what you think this will quickly lead to, and that kind of sets the stage for what I wanted to ask both of you your opinion on.
[00:39:24.859 --> 00:39:38.453]  It's not just oil, and I think, Alex, you read the Albert Pike statements about where this was eventually going and how it would work toward World War III, but let me ask you both this.
[00:39:38.453 --> 00:39:46.001]  I can agree with you both on all of that, but I really believe that this will be the beginning of putting us into a full-blown jihad.
[00:39:46.963 --> 00:39:50.647]  Which will just terribly damage not only Christianity, but the Muslim religion.
[00:39:50.647 --> 00:39:55.471]  Well, we get the full-blown jihad the CIA has fostered and controlled.
[00:39:55.471 --> 00:40:01.077]  Yes, thank you, and I believe that this will take us pretty much down the road to what Pike said.
[00:40:02.203 --> 00:40:12.148]  I think they really want to replace the other... Well, let's hear from Dr. Monteith about Pike's statements, the top Confederate general and founder of the Klan and the rest of it.
[00:40:12.148 --> 00:40:18.931]  He wrote a book about three world wars and detailed the first two and then detailed what's shaping up for number three and did that in the 1870s.
[00:40:18.931 --> 00:40:22.172]  How did Pike do that over a hundred years ago, Dr. Monteith?
[00:40:22.671 --> 00:40:26.212]  Well, first of all, as far as the authenticity of that, we've tried to document it.
[00:40:26.212 --> 00:40:31.114]  I haven't been able to document it, but I will tell you a very good friend of mine... Well, it's out of the British Naval Museum.
[00:40:31.114 --> 00:40:31.574]  Hold on.
[00:40:31.574 --> 00:40:35.276]  The British Naval Museum with his letter, his book, Morals and Dogmas, speaks about it.
[00:40:35.276 --> 00:40:36.856]  That's a published book.
[00:40:36.856 --> 00:40:37.096]  Right.
[00:40:37.096 --> 00:40:37.637]  Well, uh...
[00:40:39.097 --> 00:40:45.381]  I can't find that in morals and dogma, but I will tell you that the idea came from a letter that was supposedly at the British Museum.
[00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:48.963]  I had a friend, Des Griffin, who was trying to track that down.
[00:40:48.963 --> 00:40:52.485]  The fellow was going to come to bring him the verification of that.
[00:40:52.485 --> 00:40:59.389]  He just happened to die two days before he arrived to meet the meeting with Des, which sort of makes me think that probably this is accurate.
[00:40:59.389 --> 00:41:03.491]  Certainly, there are many other anticipations of what lies ahead.
[00:41:04.171 --> 00:41:12.138]  And I will tell you, of course, that if indeed this is the case, Pike had a first-hand relationship with Lucifer himself.
[00:41:12.138 --> 00:41:16.622]  Now, I will tell you... Well, Pike did say that Lucifer was God, moral dogma.
[00:41:16.622 --> 00:41:17.463]  I read that.
[00:41:17.463 --> 00:41:18.064]  Absolutely.
[00:41:18.064 --> 00:41:25.270]  And I will tell you that a good friend of mine, William Snevelin, you ought to get him on sometime, was deeply involved in Luciferianism.
[00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.892]  In fact, his mentor was Manly P. Hall.
[00:41:27.892 --> 00:41:30.675]  And Manly P. Hall, according to Bill Snevelin, he told me this.
[00:41:31.275 --> 00:41:33.959]  Manly P. Hall told him about the First Gulf War.
[00:41:33.959 --> 00:41:39.105]  He told him about the Second Gulf War in 2002 and 2003.
[00:41:39.105 --> 00:41:41.067]  Now, this was in the early 1980s.
[00:41:41.067 --> 00:41:47.295]  He told him this would be associated with a biological attack on the United States, followed by a nuclear exchange.
[00:41:48.326 --> 00:41:48.866]  Unbelievable.
[00:41:48.866 --> 00:41:51.168]  Dr. Monteith, your contact info real quick.
[00:41:51.168 --> 00:41:54.109]  1-800-5-HIV-WAR.
[00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:56.111]  That's 1-800-5-HIV-WAR.
[00:41:56.111 --> 00:42:03.895]  If you'd like a free copy of our latest newsletter, which is the testimony of Kristen Breitweiser, which has been suppressed by the media, give us a call.
[00:42:03.895 --> 00:42:06.016]  We'd be glad to get you free of charge.
[00:42:06.016 --> 00:42:06.417]  All right.
[00:42:06.417 --> 00:42:12.220]  The suppression there of the fact that the Port Authority sent a testimony, told people to stay in the buildings.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.160]  1-800-5-HIV-WAR.
[00:42:14.947 --> 00:42:18.251]  Dr. Monte, 1-800-5-H-I-V-WARD.
[00:42:18.251 --> 00:42:19.352]  Alright, thanks for joining us.
[00:42:19.352 --> 00:42:20.373]  I'll be back with news.
[00:42:20.373 --> 00:42:20.873]  God bless you.
[00:42:20.873 --> 00:42:21.154]  Bye-bye.
