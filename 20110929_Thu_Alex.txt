[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.860]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.860 --> 00:37.440]  all right ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday the 29th day of September 2011
[00:37.440 --> 00:42.240]  and I'm a little bit nauseous this morning my wife was sick last night and
[00:42.240 --> 00:45.760]  it's kind of hit me right now there's a chance during the broadcast I may punch
[00:45.760 --> 00:49.600]  out but Aaron Dykes against us up here late last night because he's not here
[00:49.600 --> 00:53.660]  right now he would he would come and sit in if that is the case but you know what
[00:53.660 --> 00:57.260]  now that I'm on air I'm feeling pretty good so please don't call and give me
[00:57.260 --> 01:02.580]  any remedies I was just letting you know that if I sound a bit
[01:02.580 --> 01:09.060]  stayed or a bit different today I just giving you a heads up on that front hey
[01:09.060 --> 01:15.900]  I'm doing better than Hugo Chavez Hugo Chavez is in the hospital for kidney
[01:15.900 --> 01:21.580]  failure right now and you know when I've seen him lately on television video
[01:21.580 --> 01:26.500]  and photos of him he looks like death warmed over I've seen a lot of people
[01:26.500 --> 01:31.020]  fighting for their lives and he looks like it you know I don't like Hugo Chavez
[01:31.020 --> 01:36.100]  but I still don't wish any harm upon him ten years ago when he was first in
[01:36.100 --> 01:42.380]  office saying no to the Union of Central and South America and the globalist I
[01:42.380 --> 01:46.860]  like that but they say power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely and
[01:46.860 --> 01:50.820]  so just because the West is run by evil people that have tried to overthrow
[01:50.820 --> 01:55.260]  Chavez and tried to have coos does it then by extension mean oh then he's
[01:55.260 --> 02:03.060]  good but reportedly he's been rushed to the hospital for kidney failure Hugo
[02:03.060 --> 02:09.020]  Chavez in hospital for chemo therapy often on the last few months and that
[02:09.020 --> 02:15.420]  will make your kidneys fail and so he's now been rushed to the hospital I'm
[02:15.420 --> 02:19.060]  gonna try to get a lady I know who did live in Austin for many years and as a
[02:19.060 --> 02:25.260]  patriot who now lives in Germany and she just so happened to be on the phone this
[02:25.260 --> 02:29.500]  morning with Richard Reeves who now works in this office full-time so I was
[02:29.500 --> 02:33.740]  talking to Helga and I think I've twisted her arm to be on at 12 30 today
[02:33.740 --> 02:38.940]  from Germany just to pop in to give us her view as a German who's also lived in
[02:38.940 --> 02:45.100]  the US for many years but moved back to Germany on Germany approves reforms to
[02:45.100 --> 02:49.380]  Euro bailout fund that means fully waving what sovereignty they've got left
[02:49.380 --> 02:57.740]  that is CNBC so we're going to be going over that report also bag of severed
[02:57.740 --> 03:04.140]  heads left near the Mexican school drug crackdown has gangs turning to
[03:04.140 --> 03:09.500]  extortion yeah I saw a report where a high school Mexican high school football
[03:09.500 --> 03:16.100]  team couldn't come to Texas and play the round rock dragons I didn't know that
[03:16.100 --> 03:20.700]  Texas high schools play Mexican high schools but whatever it's all
[03:20.700 --> 03:25.460]  competition and that they said well we can't come play now because we got to
[03:25.460 --> 03:30.300]  pay $30,000 to a drug gang I go into football team it was a soccer team I
[03:30.300 --> 03:33.980]  can't keep track of this stuff anymore I guess you would call it football in

[04:09.500 --> 04:14.260]  me cover certain things so I don't forget or to remind me when I don't get to
[04:14.260 --> 04:20.220]  something I said I would get to but well you know what let's do a test right

[08:18.820 --> 08:28.540]  for the next three hours now you remember Michael Allison he was facing
[08:28.540 --> 08:35.500]  life in prison that's life in prison for videotaping and audio taping the police
[08:35.500 --> 08:40.740]  and others in public now the state attorney came down to the county he was
[08:40.740 --> 08:47.860]  in the boss hog doom that he lives in little boss hogville and said we want
[08:47.860 --> 08:52.820]  him to spend life in prison with a straight face the judge threw it out now
[08:52.820 --> 08:59.260]  if I told you there were thousands of cases of police charging people for
[08:59.260 --> 09:03.900]  videotaping them in public that would be an understatement there are thousands a
[09:03.900 --> 09:10.380]  year we've looked it up we can't get the exact number but Illinois I saw a press
[09:10.380 --> 09:17.540]  report a few days ago has charged more than 500 people this year so far in fact
[09:17.540 --> 09:21.660]  there are so many of these out of Illinois that jaren did a search of it
[09:21.660 --> 09:29.260]  today and there were articles just all all over the place so many of them that
[09:29.260 --> 09:33.980]  it made our head spin we thought we were calling one guy that happened to her
[09:33.980 --> 09:36.980]  it was another guy but then he knew another guy it was happening to who
[09:36.980 --> 09:42.660]  knew another guy Chicago's artist protest backfires as he faces 15 years in
[09:42.660 --> 09:48.460]  jail because he recorded his own arrest on video that's the Daily Mail that's
[09:48.460 --> 09:57.140]  another guy okay then there's this report cops try to hit Illinois man with
[09:57.140 --> 10:01.380]  15-year jail sentence and it's consecutive so they charge you like
[10:01.380 --> 10:06.780]  Allison with six or seven counts it's live in prison cops try to hit Illinois
[10:06.780 --> 10:11.420]  man with 15-year jail sentence for recording traffic stop despite clear
[10:11.420 --> 10:16.100]  legal precedent nationwide hoax that it's illegal to film cops prevails and
[10:16.100 --> 10:21.660]  we have a little newscast here where the media people I mean now there's no
[10:21.660 --> 10:27.060]  doubt that 12 states know this is not illegal I've read the statute in
[10:27.060 --> 10:31.620]  Illinois here on air and it says nothing about videotaping and
[10:31.620 --> 10:36.700]  audio taping people in public it is in areas that are perceived to be private
[10:36.700 --> 10:42.660]  like your home or behind closed doors in your office where both parties are not
[10:42.660 --> 10:48.020]  informed okay wiretapping is putting a wiretap on somebody without their
[10:48.020 --> 10:54.340]  consent by the way how does on-star get away with listening to people in their
[10:54.340 --> 10:58.820]  cars in all 50 states without warrants and selling it to the police and selling
[10:58.820 --> 11:01.980]  it to the feds and tracking everywhere you go and selling it to insurance
[11:01.980 --> 11:07.100]  companies that's all admitted now I told you 12 years ago because I was
[11:07.100 --> 11:11.100]  contacted by an engineer and went over the technology and few years later it
[11:11.100 --> 11:14.420]  did come out the FBI was using it without warrants now it's just admitted
[11:14.420 --> 11:18.100]  hey even if you turned it off we're listening to you even if you don't pay
[11:18.100 --> 11:21.900]  the bill and say I don't want this you buy a car they said you want to activate
[11:21.900 --> 11:26.020]  the on-star I remember I had again I told you I must have been 10 years ago I
[11:26.020 --> 11:34.740]  bought a Tahoe out at Covert country and I went out there because I knew Roger
[11:34.740 --> 11:38.060]  Raceler I don't think he works there anymore the little brother of my high
[11:38.060 --> 11:42.580]  school friends Roger racer was a UT football player a successful UT football
[11:42.580 --> 11:49.860]  player big guy point is I go out there I buy the car I said now I want you go
[11:49.860 --> 11:55.060]  into the dash and remove the cell phone system and they were like Alex come on
[11:55.060 --> 11:59.540]  you just don't enable it I'm like no it'll be used to listen to me they all
[11:59.540 --> 12:04.180]  laughed at me but said all right we'll we'll take it around back and have them
[12:04.180 --> 12:08.940]  do it and come back in a few hours again because I live in the real world I
[12:08.940 --> 12:15.220]  actually know that we have a criminal government that because believe me on
[12:15.220 --> 12:18.660]  star General Motors would not be doing that and General Motors is now the
[12:18.660 --> 12:22.420]  government would not be doing that unless they've been given government
[12:22.420 --> 12:25.900]  authorization and have been pressured to do it and it's all part of a global
[12:25.900 --> 12:29.900]  standardization moving everybody into that and actually have some news
[12:29.900 --> 12:35.940]  articles concerning this today but to make a long story short Google admits
[12:35.940 --> 12:41.020]  now six years ago 2005 we wrote articles about it from their own press release
[12:41.020 --> 12:47.020]  Google to that stockholders put out a press release is how we knew saying we've
[12:47.020 --> 12:51.980]  got new software that when you download our dashboard system or use our systems
[12:51.980 --> 12:57.900]  we can dial in and listen via the microphone or in the future all computers
[12:57.900 --> 13:03.460]  we believe and now they have will have basically built-in cameras which again
[13:03.460 --> 13:06.460]  is a double-edged sword it's thing talk to your wife talk to your husband do TV
[13:06.460 --> 13:11.060]  do you know whatever it's like something out of 2001 space Odyssey where you make
[13:11.060 --> 13:15.780]  the phone call in its video but the point is they've got it jacked in where
[13:15.780 --> 13:20.140]  when you use their services they have a basically a digital connection and a
[13:20.140 --> 13:25.420]  cookie it's connected to that connection where they can open up and watch you and
[13:25.420 --> 13:30.740]  listen to you and Google said don't worry it's a computer listening to
[13:30.740 --> 13:34.860]  everything you're doing and it said if a dog's barking in the background while
[13:34.860 --> 13:38.540]  you're on the computer we sell that data to people that might want to have dog
[13:38.540 --> 13:45.780]  food ads pop up on websites you visit that have Google ads not just it's not
[13:45.780 --> 13:51.060]  just locating off of your geographic location with cookies and then you're
[13:51.060 --> 13:56.260]  like wow it's it's they're advertising you know every restaurant within two
[13:56.260 --> 13:59.700]  miles of my house how do they know that well you're on sites and they've geo
[13:59.700 --> 14:04.260]  located you and they're and they're advertising those at you and it's not
[14:04.260 --> 14:08.820]  just Google it's Facebook they're all doing it and it it's back in the news
[14:08.820 --> 14:13.700]  we've got a bunch of new developments here today on that front I've got some
[14:13.700 --> 14:16.940]  Homeland Security news out of Green Bay but before I get to that let me bring up
[14:16.940 --> 14:24.740]  some older Green Bay news for you it's in Matrix of Evil 2003 it's free online if
[14:24.740 --> 14:28.100]  you want to watch it or you could support us and by the DVD of course the film
[14:28.100 --> 14:33.740]  has Ron Ball in it more and I just read in there in a speech I give from the
[14:33.740 --> 14:38.980]  Green Bay newspaper where the governor was given a tour to the media of one
[14:38.980 --> 14:42.340]  of the first threat fusion centers in the country that was public and he said
[14:42.340 --> 14:46.340]  look here we just top type in your name he showed the reporters the mayor of
[14:46.340 --> 14:50.580]  Wisconsin the governor of Wisconsin at the time and he said look I just tracked
[14:50.580 --> 14:54.300]  where you are in the cell phone your pocket and it freaked out the people
[14:54.300 --> 14:59.900]  that were there enough that later they tried to pull that story but but that's
[14:59.900 --> 15:03.220]  what they've got all over the country the cops know what pizza you ordered
[15:03.220 --> 15:08.700]  yesterday they know how fast you drove they know everything through these
[15:08.700 --> 15:13.580]  quote services you pay for it's by federal regulations that all the cell
[15:13.580 --> 15:17.100]  phones are tracking in real time where you are what you're doing they punch
[15:17.100 --> 15:22.620]  one button it dials in and they know where you are what you're doing they
[15:22.620 --> 15:27.620]  can listen to you and it does violate federal and state wiretapping laws
[15:27.620 --> 15:33.620]  they've not overturned those laws it was federal regulations to manufacturers
[15:33.620 --> 15:39.620]  that all of this be built-in standard so so they're not going to get in any
[15:39.620 --> 15:48.100]  trouble for this they're not gonna get in any trouble for doing all of this you
[15:48.100 --> 15:52.460]  have to understand that because they're the system they selectively enforce but
[15:52.460 --> 16:01.300]  when you protest that you don't have a right to protest without a permit and
[16:01.300 --> 16:06.940]  that that turns a privilege into and it turns a right into a privilege and you
[16:06.940 --> 16:11.260]  get arrested and you videotape it you're gonna go to jail now clearly the
[16:11.260 --> 16:18.740]  statute doesn't say that it's official oppression it's unlawful arrest it's
[16:18.740 --> 16:23.140]  false arrest it's racketeering it's a civil rights violation I mean this is
[16:23.140 --> 16:30.860]  like North Korean level super creepy tyranny and the cops all over the
[16:30.860 --> 16:36.700]  country it's being overturned by federal and state courts hundreds and
[16:36.700 --> 16:42.540]  hundreds of times and they don't care and in some cases people fall for the
[16:42.540 --> 16:47.300]  cracks they don't get the right lawyer they don't know their rights hundreds of
[16:47.300 --> 16:51.660]  people that we're gonna report on it if not tomorrow next week hundreds of
[16:51.660 --> 16:57.380]  people have served sentences are or are in jail right now that we know of in
[16:57.380 --> 17:03.260]  these 12 states that are that are doing this because the jury didn't understand
[17:03.260 --> 17:07.140]  the law the judge was corrupt and let it go forward and they're being sent to
[17:07.140 --> 17:13.060]  jail for videotaping police in public and in one of the cases I saw it was in
[17:13.060 --> 17:16.980]  Maryland where the cops were 200 yards away beating someone and somebody
[17:16.980 --> 17:20.040]  videotaped it and the cops just came over and arrested them and took them to
[17:20.040 --> 17:25.620]  jail too and that person served a year long plus sentence and we're working on
[17:25.620 --> 17:31.620]  getting them on in America the cops know full well you have a first amendment
[17:31.620 --> 17:35.020]  right in public to videotape them or when they pull you over you have a right
[17:35.020 --> 17:41.900]  to videotape them and in 12 states at the state government level they have
[17:41.900 --> 17:46.060]  made conscious decisions and in the morning briefings have told the state
[17:46.060 --> 17:50.140]  police and others somebody videotapes you you take them to jail we're gonna
[17:50.140 --> 17:54.460]  charge them and we don't care if the law didn't really say this we're tired of
[17:54.460 --> 17:58.100]  being videotaped we're gonna send a chilling effect and they go out as an
[17:58.100 --> 18:03.780]  organized crime operation to violate your civil rights in a focused conscious
[18:03.780 --> 18:11.940]  way it doesn't get any more creepy and criminal now 38 states don't do this
[18:11.940 --> 18:17.820]  Texas is amongst them where the police and honor the first amendment but I
[18:17.820 --> 18:20.940]  shouldn't even have to say thank you for doing your job I mean that's just a
[18:20.940 --> 18:26.660]  given they did lose a lot of lawsuits all over the state back in 99 2000 there
[18:26.660 --> 18:32.820]  were hundreds there were more than more than 15 or so at the time in Austin that
[18:32.820 --> 18:36.740]  they lost back then they would come up and say turn your camera off or I'm an
[18:36.740 --> 18:39.460]  arrest you and I'd say why you're interfering with the police officer's
[18:39.460 --> 18:43.420]  duty or and I'd be like I'm a hundred yards away from you in that checkpoint
[18:43.420 --> 18:47.260]  you want me to move back I'll be reasonable but do you think it's
[18:47.260 --> 18:50.340]  reasonable for me to move back or like turn that camera off you've seen the
[18:50.340 --> 18:54.340]  tapes with my cancer myself they're on YouTube and I'll go okay I'm gonna have
[18:54.340 --> 18:59.860]  to sue you you know that this is wrong and if you take me to jail I I'll beat
[18:59.860 --> 19:04.740]  the rap I won't beat the ride but you're not gonna beat the ride either and I'll
[19:04.740 --> 19:08.100]  say come you've seen the videos I'll say do you want to lose your house in jet
[19:08.100 --> 19:14.220]  ski you make the decision right now you make the call and every time the cop goes
[19:14.220 --> 19:20.580]  alright whatever but again why should I have to sit there and talk to you like
[19:20.580 --> 19:25.340]  that why are you in my face I'm gonna videotape you just like you've got your
[19:25.340 --> 19:29.220]  cameras up everywhere videotaping us and license plate scanning us and
[19:29.220 --> 19:35.940]  everything else all right but point is there's there are literally thousands of
[19:35.940 --> 19:42.100]  people being charged right now in 12 states I'm seeing cases where cops come
[19:42.100 --> 19:48.260]  in your business and for the surveillance cameras if they have audio
[19:48.260 --> 19:52.860]  they're clapping people in iris and again it's getting thrown out of court

[24:36.380 --> 24:43.380]  it really is an indicator of criminal willful conscious
[24:43.380 --> 24:49.380]  premeditated corruption and official oppression and tyranny with a big fat
[24:49.380 --> 24:54.900]  capital T that in 12 states in the worst is Illinois that's where we see the
[24:54.900 --> 24:59.300]  biggest percentage of cases they're the they're the king daddy of this of this
[24:59.300 --> 25:06.460]  treason where they are arresting demonstrators activists business owners
[25:06.460 --> 25:12.740]  people that are videotaping cops from their front yard and the cops know that
[25:12.740 --> 25:16.620]  it's not applicable in the statute they know Illinois courts have thrown it out
[25:16.620 --> 25:23.820]  over and over again and they do not care and justice states that official
[25:23.820 --> 25:29.580]  corruption is to be punished even more than grassroots corruption because it's
[25:29.580 --> 25:36.420]  so dangerous when this the power of the state gets out of hand and instead these
[25:36.420 --> 25:40.300]  police continue and these district attorneys continue and the state
[25:40.300 --> 25:48.340]  attorneys continue to try to put people in jail I mean they just threw out a
[25:48.340 --> 25:51.900]  week and a half ago the case of mr. Allison where they wanted life in
[25:51.900 --> 25:56.100]  prison for videotaping and audio taping police in public and letting them know he
[25:56.100 --> 26:04.260]  was I mean I I have run hidden cameras all the time police do it all the time
[26:04.260 --> 26:07.820]  when they pull you over they don't tell you they got a little camera you know on
[26:07.820 --> 26:15.060]  their lapel basically hidden are they gonna go to jail no they're not gonna go
[26:15.060 --> 26:18.540]  to jail there's no perception in public you should know that when you're in
[26:18.540 --> 26:24.060]  public you don't have any privacy now if somebody comes up and climbs your back
[26:24.060 --> 26:29.160]  fence and goes up and puts a bug up against your window pick up audio yeah
[26:29.160 --> 26:34.340]  you should get jail time but the government's doing stuff like that
[26:34.340 --> 26:41.180]  Google's doing that Tom Tom's doing that on stars doing that and they're not
[26:41.180 --> 26:45.780]  getting in any trouble because they're claiming you contracted with them on the
[26:45.780 --> 26:51.460]  past they didn't even tell you they were doing this as people learn more they
[26:51.460 --> 27:00.340]  have been forced to do this so what do we do about this it's the people of
[27:00.340 --> 27:04.140]  Illinois need to get angry you know I've got a little short ABC newscast I want
[27:04.140 --> 27:07.460]  to play here and listen to these reporters how many of these reports have
[27:07.460 --> 27:11.500]  I played where the reporters all over the country go along with this oh video
[27:11.500 --> 27:15.860]  taping police in public or a traffic stop you're going to jail these
[27:15.860 --> 27:20.780]  journalists know the power of the press they know the power of the First
[27:20.780 --> 27:25.180]  Amendment they know they know all over Illinois it's been thrown out this is

[28:17.260 --> 28:21.420]  voice of a police officer without his or her permission you're committing a
[28:21.420 --> 28:25.060]  felony ABC 7 Paul might be joining us tonight to tell us about a man who
[28:25.060 --> 28:28.260]  learned about the law the hard way and has decided to challenge the state's
[28:28.260 --> 28:33.220]  eavesdropping law Kathy and Ron this is the story of Louis probe but it's also
[28:33.220 --> 28:36.940]  about others who run afoul of the Illinois eavesdropping law one of the
[28:36.940 --> 28:40.940]  most restrictive of its kind in the country it requires that all parties to
[28:40.940 --> 28:45.940]  a conversation give their consent before you can record it legally say you take
[28:45.940 --> 28:49.460]  out your smartphone and you start taking pictures of police officers making an
[28:49.460 --> 28:54.300]  arrest the pictures the video is allowed by law but you must have permission
[28:54.300 --> 29:00.020]  before you record the audio even if the officer is on the public way oh I'm just
[29:00.020 --> 29:02.900]  an ordinary citizen I was on my way to the movies and all of a sudden I'm
[29:02.900 --> 29:06.940]  facing a felony in 15 years in prison Louis probe calls it the worst
[29:06.940 --> 29:10.900]  experience of his life he was on his way to a late evening movie on an August
[29:10.900 --> 29:14.980]  night last year when he was stopped for speeding in far north suburban Lyndon
[29:14.980 --> 29:19.380]  Hurst Louis didn't believe he was in a 35 mile an hour zone and he figured if
[29:19.380 --> 29:22.660]  he's going to get a ticket he wanted to be able to document his challenge with
[29:22.660 --> 29:26.620]  video evidence so he got out this pocket camera which he was not real
[29:26.620 --> 29:31.020]  adapted using at one point he held it out the window trying to record where he
[29:31.020 --> 29:36.500]  was when the officer being recorded on his squad dash cam walk back to Louis
[29:36.500 --> 29:40.740]  that's enough we're gonna come back these are criminals that are falsely

[33:33.540 --> 33:38.420]  organization for the legalization of marijuana laws has confirmed and gotten
[33:38.420 --> 33:45.460]  the ATF letter that they're now trailing gun dealers that it's up to them to find
[33:45.460 --> 33:51.260]  out if somebody is a medical marijuana cardholder under state law and that they
[33:51.260 --> 33:56.580]  then cannot sell them a firearm and basically implies that people that are
[33:56.580 --> 34:04.380]  medical marijuana holders now cannot own a gun now this is outside of law this is
[34:04.380 --> 34:08.820]  outside of law you know they try to twist it and claim they've got authority
[34:08.820 --> 34:12.100]  but it's just like the ATF saying we don't need a law we're just gonna say
[34:12.100 --> 34:15.660]  now if you sell more two or more rifles you got to report it to us it's already
[34:15.660 --> 34:19.660]  reported to the FBI through Knicks and the instant check but they it's just
[34:19.660 --> 34:24.140]  about we set the precedent you do what we say outside of law and then it moves
[34:24.140 --> 34:29.340]  on to things like oh we're gonna charge people using marijuana with a doctor's
[34:29.340 --> 34:35.580]  card under and they say in the letter we don't care what the state law says this
[34:35.580 --> 34:40.100]  is lawlessness but it is undoubted lawlessness that cops don't want to
[34:40.100 --> 34:43.580]  be videotaped and I'm showing this newscast to analyze the propaganda of
[34:43.580 --> 34:48.260]  the newscast as well then we're going to two gassed who both been victims of
[34:48.260 --> 34:57.220]  this here in a moment where the cop pulls the guy over and the cop comes up
[34:57.220 --> 35:01.260]  and he's recording video and audio and he sees the guy with his camera out the
[35:01.260 --> 35:07.380]  window videotaping you know the his surroundings because he believes he was
[35:07.380 --> 35:13.460]  driving the speed limit you know what I've thought about mounting in my car a
[35:13.460 --> 35:17.660]  built-in camera system with like three or four cameras on the car like one of
[35:17.660 --> 35:21.340]  the front one on the back two on the inside you know one pointing out one
[35:21.340 --> 35:26.100]  with a dome shot of the inside in fact I've even had years ago a sponsor that
[35:26.100 --> 35:31.860]  was a sponsor on our website who was actually offering this that's a good
[35:31.860 --> 35:37.340]  idea because they do not like it they do not like it and and say this vehicle
[35:37.340 --> 35:41.060]  protected by video and audio surveillance I mean what are they gonna start
[35:41.060 --> 35:45.980]  doing charging a 7-11 when they walk in and it has that but again here is the
[35:45.980 --> 35:51.540]  cop in Illinois pulls him over and the gentleman says I'm videotaping this and
[35:51.540 --> 35:55.860]  the cops just like okay that's it for you buddy again and I've read the Illinois
[35:55.860 --> 36:01.460]  statute it doesn't say this and for years it's been thrown out of court but
[36:01.460 --> 36:04.940]  they don't care they keep charging and charging and charging take Michael
[36:04.940 --> 36:09.100]  Allison who's about to join us along with Christopher Drew who's under the gun
[36:09.100 --> 36:16.140]  right now facing 15 years for protesting and videotaping it and he's got
[36:16.140 --> 36:20.420]  lung cancer and well he'll tell you his story in a moment but they also want us
[36:20.420 --> 36:25.360]  to pay his taxpayers to incarcerate these people while violent offenders are
[36:25.360 --> 36:30.020]  released show it folks it's the essence of tyranny when they put law abiding
[36:30.020 --> 36:36.900]  citizens in dungeons and and it's hard to get into these cops mindset and the
[36:36.900 --> 36:43.020]  state attorney's mindset that they would have no humanity and see you as an
[36:43.020 --> 36:47.100]  animal and want to create a chilling effect so the public won't videotape
[36:47.100 --> 36:52.860]  their other abuses this is a desperate incredibly abusive thing and if this
[36:52.860 --> 36:58.060]  stands we're becoming North Korea let's go ahead and finish the news clip on the
[36:58.060 --> 37:02.580]  public way I'm just an ordinary citizen I was on my way to the movies and all
[37:02.580 --> 37:06.860]  of a sudden I'm facing a felony in 15 years in prison Louis Frobe calls it the
[37:06.860 --> 37:10.660]  worst experience of his life he was on his way to a late evening movie on an
[37:10.660 --> 37:14.340]  August night last year when he was stopped for speeding in far north
[37:14.340 --> 37:18.980]  suburban Lindenhurst Louis didn't believe he was in a 35 mile an hour zone and he
[37:18.980 --> 37:22.060]  figured if he's going to get a ticket he wanted to be able to document his
[37:22.060 --> 37:26.460]  challenge with video evidence so he got out this pocket camera which he was not
[37:26.460 --> 37:31.020]  real adapted using at one point he held it out the window trying to record where
[37:31.020 --> 37:36.380]  he was when the officer being recorded on his squad dash cam walked back to
[37:36.380 --> 37:47.020]  Louis's car the officer saw Louis's camera
[37:55.020 --> 38:00.300]  Louis Frobe is then cuffed and arrested for felony eavesdropping that is
[38:00.300 --> 38:04.780]  tyranny that is evil I said I didn't know about this law would you please take
[38:04.780 --> 38:08.420]  the camera it's like this is no big deal and smash it I was like you know I
[38:08.420 --> 38:13.620]  didn't know about the law Louis spent a night in the Lake County jail was
[38:13.620 --> 38:17.940]  released on bond the next day later the charges against him were dropped but so
[38:17.940 --> 38:22.700]  angry was Louis Frobe that he decided to file a federal lawsuit challenging the
[38:22.700 --> 38:27.300]  constitutionality of the state let's stop right there and they had it's been
[38:27.300 --> 38:33.220]  overturned over and over again here's the cop video taping him and audio taping
[38:33.220 --> 38:41.860]  him and even when the guy groveled and said take it smash it uh-huh he wanted
[38:41.860 --> 38:46.820]  to punish that guy he wanted to put him in jail and that cop would sleep good at
[38:46.820 --> 38:52.580]  night if that family man spent 15 years in the pen in an Illinois state pen
[38:52.580 --> 39:03.140]  the tension ring I mean do you have no basic decency Illinois and the other
[39:03.140 --> 39:07.420]  11 states doing it do you think any of us are safe our bank accounts our
[39:07.420 --> 39:12.580]  pensions our futures anything if there's not rule of law if government can get
[39:12.580 --> 39:19.060]  away with that if that officer not servant not peace officer but officer
[39:19.060 --> 39:25.340]  enforcer who's enforcing garbage when the statute doesn't even say how they're
[39:25.340 --> 39:30.820]  applying it can do that and treat a fellow citizen like their dirt you're
[39:30.820 --> 39:34.980]  going to be treated like dirt don't you get that these these protections are
[39:34.980 --> 39:43.460]  here for us all hard fought for they're hiring more and more cops because the
[39:43.460 --> 39:48.860]  corrupt system on top is protecting them who want to enslave us and more and
[39:48.860 --> 39:52.420]  more they're becoming enemies of the republic enemies the American people
[39:52.420 --> 39:58.580]  just like they are in North Korea or Mexico everybody knows in other parts
[39:58.580 --> 40:03.860]  of the world the police are dangerous dirty thugs a street gang there is a
[40:03.860 --> 40:10.620]  very small separation between guardians of liberty peace officers and enforcers
[40:10.620 --> 40:17.220]  for a corrupt state and you've got to decide which side you're on I mean now
[40:17.220 --> 40:22.260]  there's checkpoints all over the country with the military with the police
[40:22.260 --> 40:25.140]  totally illegal what they're doing violence classic commentators other
[40:25.140 --> 40:29.700]  laws they're just doing it you've got to start saying no and I know a lot of
[40:29.700 --> 40:33.060]  people do say no they had kicked off the force well then you need to not just
[40:33.060 --> 40:37.420]  leave the force you need to speak out you need to file lawsuits you need to get
[40:37.420 --> 40:41.140]  involved if you see what cop in one of these states going let's charge this guy
[40:41.140 --> 40:44.980]  or you're their supervisor you need to come and say no this has been thrown out
[40:44.980 --> 40:48.180]  over and over again but see these cops do it because they're told in their
[40:48.180 --> 40:53.900]  briefings go out there and teach the public not to tape us and I've talked
[40:53.900 --> 40:56.900]  to police who've been involved they'll say uh in that in that really
[40:56.900 --> 41:01.020]  unconstitutional oh you're not gonna get promoted they want to promote tough
[41:01.020 --> 41:06.900]  guys who are on roids who will go out and and push our families around well
[41:06.900 --> 41:11.940]  you know what's gonna happen 1776 is gonna happen let's not go there okay
[41:11.940 --> 41:17.860]  let's not go there don't follow the orders of these criminal bankers okay
[41:17.860 --> 41:22.060]  I'm done I want to go now for the rest of the hour to Michael Allison and
[41:22.060 --> 41:25.460]  Christopher Drew Michael Allison of course faced life in prison the judge
[41:25.460 --> 41:29.900]  threw the case out on the Constitution agreed because he they had the precedent
[41:29.900 --> 41:35.060]  of all the other judges rulings and common sense but the state still wanted
[41:35.060 --> 41:39.140]  Allison life in prison now here's the Daily Mail Chicago artists protest
[41:39.140 --> 41:43.860]  backfires as he faces 15 years in jail because he recorded his own arrest on
[41:43.860 --> 41:48.380]  video and joining us is activist Chris Drew Chris thank you for coming on with
[41:48.380 --> 41:49.140]  us today
[41:49.140 --> 41:56.100]  hi well briefly tell us about why you're protesting what you're facing and I
[41:56.100 --> 41:59.260]  guess since you have lung cancer this is their little little way of trying to
[41:59.260 --> 42:04.980]  help you out yeah they gave me a two month delay so I could get better from
[42:04.980 --> 42:11.420]  lung cancer they were being very generous well I was arrested for selling
[42:11.420 --> 42:17.340]  out for a dollar on State Street that's a misdemeanor of course but they decided
[42:17.340 --> 42:23.300]  because I was protesting a law that would make the city better by allowing
[42:23.300 --> 42:29.540]  artists to make a living in public that I deserve something more than just a
[42:29.540 --> 42:36.620]  misdemeanor so they found a recorder an audio recorder in now you should realize
[42:36.620 --> 42:42.540]  that I had a team with me that was documenting this I had another female
[42:42.540 --> 42:47.380]  artist who you're recording to protect yourself you're in public you have a
[42:47.380 --> 42:51.860]  right to protect yourself it's your office out there another artist video
[42:51.860 --> 42:56.060]  taping and audio taping the whole thing and they didn't they didn't arrest her
[42:56.060 --> 43:00.940]  they arrested me and chat on selling out for a dollar and then charged me with a
[43:00.940 --> 43:05.900]  class one felony now that's a malicious prosecution because that class one
[43:05.900 --> 43:12.780]  felony aspect of the Illinois law was it doesn't read for conversation for
[43:12.780 --> 43:19.420]  taping a conversation between a citizen and a police officer it's for spying on
[43:19.420 --> 43:25.260]  the justice system it read for audio recording a conversation between a
[43:25.260 --> 43:28.540]  police officer we know it's unconstitutional it's been thrown out
[43:28.540 --> 43:32.900]  over and over again the point here is though that they're trying to keep
[43:32.900 --> 43:36.020]  people from selling things on the street because you're only allowed to
[43:36.020 --> 43:39.220]  buy stuff from big box stores right another uncount just like they're
[43:39.220 --> 43:42.140]  going out for lemonade stands all over the country and arresting little kids
[43:42.140 --> 43:46.300]  are in you can't have a guard in your front yard and a judge in Wisconsin has
[43:46.300 --> 43:50.100]  ruled I've got that article coming up later that you're not allowed to grow
[43:50.100 --> 43:53.220]  your own vegetables they say under the police power you don't have that right
[43:53.220 --> 43:58.020]  so we understand their tyrants but specifically tell us where where this
[43:58.020 --> 44:03.100]  is going with the 15 years you face well there are continuing in spite of the
[44:03.100 --> 44:08.100]  fact that another judge has called it unconstitutional continuing to prosecute
[44:08.100 --> 44:15.580]  my case and we'll probably have a trial in November or certainly before
[44:15.580 --> 44:20.580]  February of next year now you're right it is malicious prosecution it's also
[44:20.580 --> 44:25.100]  official oppression it is racketeering because they know that the statue that
[44:25.100 --> 44:29.140]  you just read is for spying on the justice system that would mean planning
[44:29.140 --> 44:33.540]  a bug in the district attorney's office or something like that not not having
[44:33.540 --> 44:38.060]  video or audio in your own car or there to demonstration obviously they're
[44:38.060 --> 44:43.100]  trying to punish you for your political action exact for your speech
[44:43.100 --> 44:50.780]  definitely and there's no better example that I'm an artist selling out on the street that's the most
[44:50.780 --> 44:55.340]  protected activity in this country according to the First Amendment but
[44:55.340 --> 44:59.460]  according to Supreme Court rulings right we have to fight for those rights well
[44:59.460 --> 45:02.660]  it's your freedom of expression I mean they're hitting you on so many fronts
[45:02.660 --> 45:06.500]  and I know there's federal lawsuits by some over this but we need to go ahead
[45:06.500 --> 45:12.020]  and see these police and others charged for the fact they're trying to frame
[45:12.020 --> 45:17.060]  citizens especially the prosecutors because the prosecutors are the ones who
[45:17.060 --> 45:23.380]  brought this this in the city of Chicago in order to prosecute a felony the
[45:23.380 --> 45:27.820]  prosecutors had make that decision the policeman did not make that decision it
[45:27.820 --> 45:33.620]  took them three hours four hours to decide to prosecute me on that class 1
[45:33.620 --> 45:38.740]  felony that officer had no decision-making power in that yeah but he
[45:38.740 --> 45:42.580]  clearly triggered it he clearly triggered it by saying because you were
[45:42.580 --> 45:47.660]  recording it that you were somehow bad oh yeah he's a participant in it but he's
[45:47.660 --> 45:54.700]  a participant trying to destroy this country but it's just the machine city
[45:54.700 --> 46:00.500]  and and the decision was made by the machine and the officer was just if they
[46:00.500 --> 46:07.760]  decided another way if they decided as they did and in another case where the
[46:07.760 --> 46:14.140]  officer the tape of the officer hit the newsstand before they got to it they
[46:14.140 --> 46:21.340]  decided to in that case discipline the officer so it it's a decision made at
[46:21.340 --> 46:29.540]  least in Chicago now the phone case that was a decision by the officer but in
[46:29.540 --> 46:37.060]  in Chicago those decisions are made by the prosecutor the Cook County state's
[46:37.060 --> 46:42.180]  attorney yeah but we know Chicago is famous there's no corruption in the
[46:42.180 --> 46:47.380]  police or the government right that's exactly right that they're all one and
[46:47.380 --> 46:51.580]  and if you want the news on corruption it all comes from them no I know they
[46:51.580 --> 46:56.820]  wrote the book on it in fact the Chicago mob model of 1313 with the with the
[46:56.820 --> 47:00.540]  double set of books where you have city budget and then all the real money that
[47:00.540 --> 47:04.540]  was adopted in the 50s by the entire country and the Federal Reserve and
[47:04.540 --> 47:08.780]  that's where they've stolen about 85% on average of our tax money to their
[47:08.780 --> 47:12.580]  offshore accounts it's all public I mean this government is just been
[47:12.580 --> 47:17.020]  operating and criminal for so long in Chicago really taught us how along with
[47:17.020 --> 47:21.740]  New York but but I mean how long will the people of Chicago put up with this
[47:21.740 --> 47:26.380]  how long people of Illinois put up with this I mean I mean how much
[47:26.380 --> 47:30.140]  criminality will you put up with by government well that's a good question
[47:30.140 --> 47:34.980]  and that's why we're making a big issue out of this because this is a prime
[47:34.980 --> 47:42.620]  example of this is a line in the sand for the people to react to young people
[47:42.620 --> 47:46.980]  are not going to stand for this if they if they convict me there's going to this
[47:46.980 --> 47:52.860]  issue is only going to grow and even whatever they do they cannot paper over
[47:52.860 --> 47:58.180]  it because young people have cell phones in their hands and they intend to use
[47:58.180 --> 48:03.660]  them there is no way that this state and this city is going to tell young
[48:03.660 --> 48:07.620]  people that they can't protect themselves in court with the truth and
[48:07.620 --> 48:13.020]  from public on the street and so it's just going to come up again and again
[48:13.020 --> 48:17.940]  and again but the system is so arrogant they don't know that they're
[48:17.940 --> 48:21.460]  destroying themselves in the eyes of the people that's what always happens in
[48:21.460 --> 48:24.940]  corruption the corrupt finally take everything over then they think they're
[48:24.940 --> 48:29.620]  invincible and start really spitting in people's face well that's Chicago here
[48:29.620 --> 48:36.260]  they think they're invincible here they start really rubbing it in and it's at
[48:36.260 --> 48:41.620]  that point that tyranny starts to really get resisted and then they even start
[48:41.620 --> 48:46.620]  attacking more and then it explodes and it's all over for the tyrants that's
[48:46.620 --> 48:52.940]  what I call Chicago the ground zero for this issue in the nation because they're
[48:52.940 --> 48:56.620]  the worst in the nation that has the worst law in the nation they're
[48:56.620 --> 49:04.100]  prosecuted in the worst possible manner and the people in Chicago are more and
[49:04.100 --> 49:09.580]  more understanding that they must change well let's come out in the news as you
[49:09.580 --> 49:13.540]  know in Chicago that cops will walk in and say to a bar and say I like your
[49:13.540 --> 49:16.620]  wife can't go over here and give me service or I'm gonna I'm gonna bust this
[49:16.620 --> 49:21.220]  place and they just say here's my wife and the cops the cops just openly deal
[49:21.220 --> 49:25.500]  the drugs I talked to Aaron Russo at the famous club there that Led Zeppelin
[49:25.500 --> 49:30.460]  others were playing at and they came in and said pay me protection money and
[49:30.460 --> 49:34.140]  they kept coming and saying more and more and finally the cops just opened
[49:34.140 --> 49:38.580]  their own club came in beat everybody up and shut it down and then took Aaron
[49:38.580 --> 49:42.580]  and torturing and then said it's our club now because they open one down the
[49:42.580 --> 49:46.060]  street I mean it's in the people just put up with it because it's Al Capone
[49:46.060 --> 49:52.300]  America is run by the spirit of Al Capone well people have to make a change
[49:52.300 --> 49:56.220]  and of course you got the daily mob boss now they've handed it over to the
[49:56.220 --> 50:01.140]  Israeli commander Rahm Emanuel to be your ruler we're gonna go to break I want
[50:01.140 --> 50:04.740]  to come back with you and I want to get to Michael Allison what do you think of
[50:04.740 --> 50:10.340]  his case he was facing a wife in prison that's totally absurd totally absurd for
[50:10.340 --> 50:16.460]  asking the right to have a fair court trial to be able to document the public
[50:16.460 --> 50:19.820]  record for the public record what's happening in court and what's happening
[50:19.820 --> 50:23.580]  in public yeah that was one of his charges he he kept asking for a court

[54:36.620 --> 54:40.260]  member thugs things like clockwork orange and others but if you've actually
[54:40.260 --> 54:45.980]  been in Chicago or you've been in New York City when you actually see these
[54:45.980 --> 54:53.140]  cops they look sullen angry on power trips arrogant rude to people I mean
[54:53.140 --> 54:58.140]  I've been in third world countries and the cops don't act like this and I've
[54:58.140 --> 55:03.860]  been in third world countries and scenes and seen seedy criminal type and it's
[55:03.860 --> 55:08.540]  just like when you're in some you know gas station a middle of nowhere at night
[55:08.540 --> 55:11.980]  you pull over and there's a pool hall right next to it and there's kind of
[55:11.980 --> 55:16.140]  scummy ex con looking people you're like oh yeah you could see it in them

[56:08.340 --> 56:12.220]  but I'm a human being you're treating me like trash a few times I didn't want to
[56:12.220 --> 56:15.700]  get arrested early on at the RNC so and you see the footage of that in police
[56:15.700 --> 56:23.620]  state film I made martial law 9-1-1 rise with police state where they where I'm
[56:23.620 --> 56:27.180]  like a hundred yards away from one of the holy facilities and the cop goes who

[58:24.700 --> 58:29.940]  case and whenever I started digging into the fact that this plane even
[58:29.940 --> 58:35.060]  existed I started trying to find out to all the information I could and I ran

[1:00:20.780 --> 1:00:25.260]  Jones okay I'm gonna try to shut up this last five minutes of both our guests
[1:00:25.260 --> 1:00:30.420]  just briefly give them the floor Christopher Drew facing 15 years in jail
[1:00:30.420 --> 1:00:36.140]  for recording his own demonstration in Chicago Michael Allison facing life in
[1:00:36.140 --> 1:00:39.900]  prison Michael finish your point then we'll give Christopher the last word
[1:00:39.900 --> 1:00:46.740]  yeah I was just saying that whenever this thing came up whenever they sprung
[1:00:46.740 --> 1:00:52.020]  this whole whole situation on me I couldn't believe it and I thought that
[1:00:52.020 --> 1:00:56.900]  the whole thing was made up the way that it it just sounded so unbelievable and
[1:00:56.900 --> 1:01:02.020]  the first thing that I did and me and my mother after they let me out of jail
[1:01:02.020 --> 1:01:08.380]  the we went to the local library and looked up the statute to see what the
[1:01:08.380 --> 1:01:15.420]  language said and what what it meant and how it was applied and it the first
[1:01:15.420 --> 1:01:20.420]  thing is is that the statute is misapplied and misinterpreted and the
[1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:27.980]  language at the end the statute is very vague and and can be interpreted just
[1:01:27.980 --> 1:01:32.500]  about any way that you know it's like the old saying of a hundred accountants
[1:01:32.500 --> 1:01:36.540]  doing the same taxes will come up with a hundred different figures yeah but it's
[1:01:36.540 --> 1:01:42.980]  but still it says spying on police and yet to go to black's law spying means
[1:01:42.980 --> 1:01:47.940]  that it's you know behind closed doors that it's that it's in private events
[1:01:47.940 --> 1:01:52.580]  which is tied to whole eavesdropping peeping toms all of that the overall
[1:01:52.580 --> 1:01:56.940]  common law and that's why the courts have all ruled this way is clearly there's
[1:01:56.940 --> 1:02:02.060]  no perception in public or in public proceedings and so the issue is that's
[1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:06.180]  why it's being thrown out all over the country the issue now is why do they
[1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:11.860]  continue to prosecute people consciously let's get a comment on that from mr.
[1:02:11.860 --> 1:02:17.660]  Dribb yeah the reason the Illinois law is the worst law in the country is it
[1:02:17.660 --> 1:02:22.820]  doesn't recognize that it has anything to do with privacy they say the beginning
[1:02:22.820 --> 1:02:27.340]  of the law that it doesn't matter whether the conversation is private or not
[1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:35.100]  it's still illegal and so that makes it an absurd law it was that was made to
[1:02:35.100 --> 1:02:41.820]  protect our privacy initially but perverted to protect and shield the
[1:02:41.820 --> 1:02:47.140]  police and our and prevent us from gathering information we need to go to
[1:02:47.140 --> 1:02:54.260]  court and protect ourselves and that's why it's ground zero for the nation
[1:02:54.260 --> 1:03:00.300]  because right now at this time in history everybody has a cell phone so we
[1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:05.780]  have power in our hands like we've never had before to watch our watchers and
[1:03:05.780 --> 1:03:14.580]  that's why they're using this law as an example you said before Chicago's been
[1:03:14.580 --> 1:03:18.580]  an example for the nation Illinois has been an example for the nation that's
[1:03:18.580 --> 1:03:23.500]  exactly what's happening here citizens must realize we're ground zero if they're
[1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:28.300]  successful at prosecuting this law in Illinois believe me police and other
[1:03:28.300 --> 1:03:34.140]  states will encourage their legislatures to pass and what does that say about the
[1:03:34.140 --> 1:03:39.740]  prosecutors and the police that they know this law is twisted and unconstitutional
[1:03:39.740 --> 1:03:43.860]  it's been ruled that and they still with glee love to arrest people it shows a
[1:03:43.860 --> 1:03:48.580]  heart of abusive oppression and hatred for basic freedom the Cook County
[1:03:48.580 --> 1:03:54.420]  state's attorney was the one who created the spine provision to made it class 1
[1:03:54.420 --> 1:03:59.620]  felony they know how it's supposed to be presented and used and they misuse it
[1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:04.820]  on purpose so that tells you exactly what that they know what they're doing
[1:04:04.820 --> 1:04:09.180]  and they're doing it for a reason and the reason is exactly what we need to
[1:04:09.180 --> 1:04:12.780]  oppose they're trying to institute a police state here in Illinois and
[1:04:12.780 --> 1:04:16.300]  actually I believe they have it oh yeah they have instituted are you kidding us
[1:04:16.300 --> 1:04:20.300]  completely mafia run so where do you go from here do you have a website or how

[1:08:57.580 --> 1:09:04.220]  perspective on what's happening because it is in the news over there that
[1:09:04.220 --> 1:09:09.220]  Germany is going ahead with signing over what's left of their sovereignty to
[1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:15.140]  this new financial dictatorship so she's gonna be popping in Mike Adams is
[1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:20.100]  gonna be with us in the last 30 minutes now the CDC is calling people at home
[1:09:20.100 --> 1:09:25.500]  harassing them threatening them telling them to provide shock shot records so
[1:09:25.500 --> 1:09:29.660]  they're basically gonna come inject their kids so now the feds talk about
[1:09:29.660 --> 1:09:33.300]  being out of their jurisdiction they're not just financing local schools to come
[1:09:33.300 --> 1:09:36.740]  knock on your door and say I'm coming in to give you a shot we played that

[1:09:41.100 --> 1:09:47.220]  door they're coming after homeschoolers everybody and now the CDC is using that
[1:09:47.220 --> 1:09:51.540]  census data and integrating an end and finding out who's got kids where they
[1:09:51.540 --> 1:09:57.060]  live now they're gonna start a yearly census where the Census Bureau is your
[1:09:57.060 --> 1:10:00.980]  little government political commas are that keeps tabs on you that's all coming
[1:10:00.980 --> 1:10:07.940]  up now yesterday I mentioned this and ever got to it and today I mentioned it
[1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:11.780]  and ever got to it but I'm gonna get to some good news right now and if you will
[1:10:11.780 --> 1:10:15.980]  give me a document cam shot please I will show the prison planet dot TV viewers
[1:10:15.980 --> 1:10:21.140]  this article if you're a radio listener you just go to info wars.com and we
[1:10:21.140 --> 1:10:25.100]  have it linked up there in yesterday's archive or just type in to the search
[1:10:25.100 --> 1:10:30.900]  engine Green Bay Packers security personnel to use handheld wands in
[1:10:30.900 --> 1:10:37.860]  effort to ratchet up safety measures at Lambeau Field now what's the good news
[1:10:37.860 --> 1:10:43.020]  here they they say that they they've gotten feedback and it's very negative
[1:10:43.020 --> 1:10:49.340]  feedback about the TSA groping that the TSA advised them or told them to do and
[1:10:49.340 --> 1:10:53.380]  Janet Apolitano has been at the Super Bowl and trying to scare everybody and
[1:10:53.380 --> 1:10:58.620]  on big telescreens and at Walmart and now breaking in on cell phones always
[1:10:58.620 --> 1:11:02.940]  forcing their propaganda on you that they're here to protect you be afraid be
[1:11:02.940 --> 1:11:09.780]  very afraid only government can save you and they say even though the NFL told
[1:11:09.780 --> 1:11:16.100]  the owners two weeks ago now that they had to grope everyone from the ankles
[1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:20.060]  up and they said we will grab your genitals we will grab your wife's breast
[1:11:20.060 --> 1:11:23.780]  and make sure they're not bombs guilty until proven innocent you're a prisoner
[1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:29.220]  they got a big backlash you heard Jesse Ventura on here a few days ago say that
[1:11:29.220 --> 1:11:33.820]  he would support a boycott of this and that he's sick of it so the Green Bay
[1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:38.660]  Packers have said that because of the feedback they've been getting they're
[1:11:38.660 --> 1:11:44.020]  now just gonna want the entire body and that's bad enough but at least they're
[1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:49.820]  not gonna be touching you so see there's pushback it shows that we're going in
[1:11:49.820 --> 1:11:55.940]  the right direction we think it's a more thorough process without having the
[1:11:55.940 --> 1:12:00.220]  hands-on in particular we understand there has been some negativity out
[1:12:00.220 --> 1:12:06.580]  there with the transportation security administration has done this just
[1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:10.540]  eliminates that process Collins said pretty much the whole body will be
[1:12:10.540 --> 1:12:15.820]  scanned with the hand one and they now say they're going to cancel what they
[1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:20.220]  did last season under TSA advice the upper body Pat down the Pat downs are
[1:12:20.220 --> 1:12:26.300]  gone Green Bay Packers so I I might actually next time in Minnesota drive
[1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:30.380]  over to Wisconsin as Genesis is based in Minnesota I might go see a Packers game
[1:12:30.380 --> 1:12:35.020]  in fact that's one of the few places an actual local you know a controlled
[1:12:35.020 --> 1:12:40.740]  supported team I might actually go see a Packers game just because they're going
[1:12:40.740 --> 1:12:44.140]  in the right direction I will not be going to a Dallas Cowboys game and
[1:12:44.140 --> 1:12:48.780]  again I haven't been to a football game in over a decade I went to a UT
[1:12:48.780 --> 1:12:51.780]  football game and it's an interesting thing you know I would like to take my
[1:12:51.780 --> 1:12:55.300]  children sometime just to experience a big sports stadium event and
[1:12:55.300 --> 1:13:00.220]  historically educate them about it and let them enjoy it I know my parents have
[1:13:00.220 --> 1:13:03.500]  requested to take them to UT football games and I said no so far because I'm
[1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:07.820]  told groping has started so they will never go to a University of Texas
[1:13:07.820 --> 1:13:10.900]  football game they will never go to a Dallas Cowboys game it will go to none
[1:13:10.900 --> 1:13:15.740]  of them because I'm not gonna put myself under your control if you want to
[1:13:15.740 --> 1:13:19.740]  quote wand and that's just a magnet at wand doesn't doesn't hurt you in any
[1:13:19.740 --> 1:13:24.340]  way like the like the body scanners to see if I got a gun sure it's your private
[1:13:24.340 --> 1:13:28.980]  corporation you want to do that that I think is somewhat reasonable I've always
[1:13:28.980 --> 1:13:34.020]  been against it though because it leads to things like the groping like the
[1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:39.020]  guilty until proven innocent shows a positive little ray little ray of light
[1:13:39.020 --> 1:13:42.740]  there that the Green Bay Packers have said we're not we you know we did upper
[1:13:42.740 --> 1:13:47.740]  body groping last year it's out the door our fans don't like it and we're not
[1:13:47.740 --> 1:13:52.660]  gonna do the whole body groping by the way they were saying come four hours
[1:13:52.660 --> 1:13:58.260]  earlier now so that everyone can be groped I mean you're gonna grop a two
[1:13:58.260 --> 1:14:02.580]  year old's diaper you're gonna this is what TSA does you're gonna grab Ron
[1:14:02.580 --> 1:14:07.580]  Paul's genitals Jesse Ventura's genitals I've had them both on the show both of
[1:14:07.580 --> 1:14:11.620]  them said it happens to him I've seen it happen to Ventura and let me his face
[1:14:11.620 --> 1:14:16.380]  was turning red and I even videotaped it and later he was embarrassed by it he's
[1:14:16.380 --> 1:14:20.020]  so funny goes we were like our plane was late so we were eating Mexican food to
[1:14:20.020 --> 1:14:25.180]  the gate I was hey gov I recorded that he goes let me see it he goes yeah I'm
[1:14:25.180 --> 1:14:29.140]  glad you didn't case something bad happened but we're going to race that and
[1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:33.420]  I race it I said you want to see he goes no I trust you sides Navy Seals you know
[1:14:33.420 --> 1:14:38.300]  I know where you live he's funny guy but I would have that footage for his court
[1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:42.180]  case if he wouldn't have told me to erase it and I mean they had that was a
[1:14:42.180 --> 1:14:46.100]  black guy and a black woman both of them searched him and they went in his
[1:14:46.100 --> 1:14:49.420]  crotch and the part really made him mad as they you know go in the buttocks
[1:14:49.420 --> 1:14:53.500]  that's in his lawsuit not gonna even say because we got kids listening but they
[1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:57.580]  you know they go and he was just like turning red going that's why I live in
[1:14:57.580 --> 1:15:02.620]  Mexico this country is East Germany I can't believe I serve this country and
[1:15:02.620 --> 1:15:07.100]  this is how this is and it was like fun and TSA people were laughing asking for
[1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:10.660]  autographs and there were people out of hey it's Jesse Ventura and he's just
[1:15:10.660 --> 1:15:15.460]  sitting there and it went on and on and on for about three minutes I'm sitting
[1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:19.220]  right there in the chair past the screening area with my iPhone videotaping
[1:15:19.220 --> 1:15:29.100]  it Alex was smart to record it in case that they case it went wrong but erase
[1:15:29.100 --> 1:15:33.940]  it well you don't mind that I record it you understand why no good idea good
[1:15:33.940 --> 1:15:40.980]  idea good idea but erase it hey you know you ought to videotape your dog on the
[1:15:40.980 --> 1:15:44.100]  treadmill you only elliptical watching Sports Center that get 10 million views
[1:15:44.100 --> 1:15:50.900]  no that's private he is something else he's I just like Ventura's I know him
[1:15:50.900 --> 1:15:56.140]  personally he he really is something else I hung out with him we're about three
[1:15:56.140 --> 1:16:00.540]  four hours we walked around the French Quarter that was interesting one time and
[1:16:00.540 --> 1:16:07.180]  then I don't out in California in places he's just funny man by the way I did
[1:16:07.180 --> 1:16:11.260]  shoot a bunch of video because he said it was fine at his birthday party and do
[1:16:11.260 --> 1:16:17.180]  has it a him singing and Harry Dean Stanton singing and I never have put
[1:16:17.180 --> 1:16:20.620]  that on YouTube I guess because it's not really political so why would I but
[1:16:20.620 --> 1:16:24.980]  maybe I'll put that on the special report section next week of prison planet
[1:16:24.980 --> 1:16:29.820]  TV okay I tend to get off into happy stories and stuff because this is the
[1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:34.100]  this is some hardcore news here but we've got to admit how far we've fallen so we
[1:16:34.100 --> 1:16:38.740]  don't fall further there's still time to turn back and to honor good people in
[1:16:38.740 --> 1:16:42.420]  government and in corporations and police who do the right thing we do
[1:16:42.420 --> 1:16:46.900]  honor here but you got to choose sides ladies and gentlemen now I wanted to get
[1:16:46.900 --> 1:16:50.220]  Ted Anderson up here briefly before I get into the news and then your calls
[1:16:50.220 --> 1:16:57.300]  and Helga's going to be joining us and Mike Adams and a lot more I wanted to
[1:16:57.300 --> 1:17:02.940]  get Ted up because exactly what we predicted happened they they kept
[1:17:02.940 --> 1:17:09.980]  raising the trading margins to where now basically they've killed the speculative
[1:17:09.980 --> 1:17:15.660]  market in gold and silver and now governments are talking about taxes on
[1:17:15.660 --> 1:17:19.700]  gold and confiscation and France is talking about it so they're gonna try
[1:17:19.700 --> 1:17:22.700]  that too but that'll only drive the price up more and if you could just hold
[1:17:22.700 --> 1:17:26.660]  on to it when they're trying to confiscate after they confiscated it'll go
[1:17:26.660 --> 1:17:30.460]  up even more and then when they legalize it later because they always hoard it
[1:17:30.460 --> 1:17:34.820]  themselves you'll be sitting pretty in my historical research opinion that's
[1:17:34.820 --> 1:17:40.740]  what I personally believe but despite all that gold and silver has run way back
[1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:47.060]  up again gold gains is EU crisis purrs haven demand Bloomberg here's another
[1:17:47.060 --> 1:17:51.180]  one Shanghai to raise gold and silver margins output up in July they're
[1:17:51.180 --> 1:17:55.580]  announcing are gonna do it again so they're like oh my there's a war folks I
[1:17:55.580 --> 1:18:01.180]  mean there's another one gold rises 1% is physical buying supports so they've
[1:18:01.180 --> 1:18:06.980]  killed the speculative market and it's still surging back so I'm gonna be honest
[1:18:06.980 --> 1:18:09.620]  with you they're gonna try I'm not turning my golden silver and I bought it
[1:18:09.620 --> 1:18:14.180]  you mafia crooks Al Capone you know Chicago mafia that runs our country
[1:18:14.180 --> 1:18:17.180]  tells me turn it in I'm not look there's got to be a line on the sand it's like
[1:18:17.180 --> 1:18:21.020]  if you say you're coming to take my kids no it's over your crooks that's the end
[1:18:21.020 --> 1:18:24.300]  of it we all know it but but there's no doubt that's where it's going because
[1:18:24.300 --> 1:18:26.940]  they're gonna devalue the currency completely and they're not gonna let
[1:18:26.940 --> 1:18:30.900]  you you know try to have golden silver now they're gonna fail the answer is just
[1:18:30.900 --> 1:18:36.620]  that's it we're not doing it I mean how many cops out there do I know that call
[1:18:36.620 --> 1:18:40.940]  me that have bought gold you gonna turn yours into these people I mean is there
[1:18:40.940 --> 1:18:48.060]  nothing you won't do we're gonna break them back with dead but the issue is
[1:18:48.060 --> 1:18:53.660]  something big has happened Chad has been in golden silver for 33 years is 34
[1:18:53.660 --> 1:18:58.260]  now time flies he's never seen it we're except for institutional and big buyers
[1:18:58.260 --> 1:19:03.380]  where people buy low sell high like you supposed to do he sees people buy when
[1:19:03.380 --> 1:19:06.540]  it's high and not when it's low he's always happy to buy it back when it's
[1:19:06.540 --> 1:19:09.740]  low that's how he passes on savings later and has become the fifth biggest
[1:19:09.740 --> 1:19:15.860]  golden silver broker in the country Ted is seeing 10 times the activity he was
[1:19:15.860 --> 1:19:19.660]  seeing he technically called me last I said let me be specific around 10 times
[1:19:19.660 --> 1:19:23.740]  what he was seeing a few months ago and two or three times what he's ever seen
[1:19:23.740 --> 1:19:29.100]  it is a meltdown at Midas Resources right now people are finally getting it
[1:19:29.100 --> 1:19:33.980]  that you buy when it's low so we're gonna come back and go to Ted Anderson for
[1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:38.460]  one segment and then get a report on the economy from Germany and get into a
[1:19:38.460 --> 1:19:44.900]  bunch of news but that's why I've seen reports they're saying bans on gold
[1:19:44.900 --> 1:19:50.780]  sales in France above 600 bucks cities all over are trying to ban gold sale
[1:19:50.780 --> 1:19:56.020]  shops the feds are openly saying hey we might do something here because they
[1:19:56.020 --> 1:20:02.300]  don't want you to protect yourself we'll be right back what happened man you used

[1:24:00.900 --> 1:24:15.220]  I think a dream for has been to not come back anymore and I painted my hands and the face of his life and I improvised the wind
[1:24:15.220 --> 1:24:31.540]  and he told me to fly in the infinite sky
[1:24:31.540 --> 1:24:36.540]  you know that's not mariachi music that's more I think South American in it
[1:24:36.540 --> 1:24:41.740]  we're in a Mexican food restaurant this weekend the mariachi guys came over and
[1:24:41.740 --> 1:24:45.820]  I was having a play Rukuku and all that stuff my wife liked it too but after a
[1:24:45.820 --> 1:24:49.900]  while she's like my gosh but I really do like more and more as I get older
[1:24:49.900 --> 1:24:56.100]  mariachi music I even got their card I might I might just go completely native
[1:24:56.100 --> 1:25:00.980]  the problem is then there's a lot of stuff I like about the culture South
[1:25:00.980 --> 1:25:05.060]  border but I don't like the drug gangs and the corruption that's grown out of
[1:25:05.060 --> 1:25:10.460]  the phony drug war and we've got to end the drug war today ladies and gentlemen
[1:25:10.460 --> 1:25:16.820]  let's go ahead and go to Ted Anderson Ted wow so your phones are melting down
[1:25:16.820 --> 1:25:21.580]  right now with people that are finally getting it that this is another market
[1:25:21.580 --> 1:25:26.740]  manipulation and but now they've responded they're announcing in Asia again
[1:25:26.740 --> 1:25:31.820]  they're gonna raise them margin calls again so I guess that means they may
[1:25:31.820 --> 1:25:35.980]  actually start making you put more money down than what you're actually betting
[1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:39.580]  on this is getting crazy well yeah and I what I think you're gonna see is there's
[1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:43.220]  gonna be a lot less volatility from that now they've already sort of blown their
[1:25:43.220 --> 1:25:47.940]  wad on this one what you would have right now if the market was falling like
[1:25:47.940 --> 1:25:51.860]  it had you would have these stop losses that would occur and people that are in
[1:25:51.860 --> 1:25:55.820]  long positions and force them into a short position to get out of their
[1:25:55.820 --> 1:26:00.420]  longs and and that's when you see these wide swings and volatility well they've
[1:26:00.420 --> 1:26:04.100]  already washed everybody out of the marketplace so now you don't have that
[1:26:04.100 --> 1:26:08.820]  it's like that that one silver bullet you know they did it and now you know you
[1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:12.940]  can raise reserve requirements or raise margin requirements as much as you want
[1:26:12.940 --> 1:26:16.220]  you're not you know they've washed the traders out of the marketplace it
[1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:20.100]  doesn't matter I mean last night I was watching the Asian markets and gold is
[1:26:20.100 --> 1:26:27.300]  dipping to about oh 1590 1589 right in that and then all of a sudden boom right
[1:26:27.300 --> 1:26:31.740]  back up into the 1600s it's almost like you know okay now we've tried this one
[1:26:31.740 --> 1:26:35.660]  what are we gonna do next and like I said the central banks the people the
[1:26:35.660 --> 1:26:39.300]  planners of the this new world order thing the people that like to control
[1:26:39.300 --> 1:26:43.620]  the world are doing everything they can if they're throwing everything plus the
[1:26:43.620 --> 1:26:47.340]  kitchen sink their first child they want everything in order to keep the
[1:26:47.340 --> 1:26:51.980]  prices of gold down because of the value of the currencies are dropping and they
[1:26:51.980 --> 1:26:55.380]  don't want people moving into gold that's why you hear France talking about
[1:26:55.380 --> 1:27:00.500]  making gold illegal this this is nothing new the United States confiscated
[1:27:00.500 --> 1:27:05.220]  gold three times in our history France has been doing it you know all throughout
[1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:08.700]  Europe big gold has become illegal because they're trying to legislate you
[1:27:08.700 --> 1:27:12.900]  back into paper currency but the people wake up and they go no we don't want your
[1:27:12.900 --> 1:27:16.940]  currency if you want us to have your currency be fiscally responsible and
[1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:20.660]  turn off your printing presses and stop bailing everybody out well that's my
[1:27:20.660 --> 1:27:24.580]  point Ted people've always said well why get gold because when the dollar does
[1:27:24.580 --> 1:27:28.020]  start dying you know the governments are gonna try to come take it they're
[1:27:28.020 --> 1:27:33.660]  crooks I mean why have kids because the CPS might try to take them or why ever
[1:27:33.660 --> 1:27:37.820]  have kids because they might die in a car wreck or why get married you might get
[1:27:37.820 --> 1:27:42.460]  a divorce you know nothing ventured nothing gained stop living like
[1:27:42.460 --> 1:27:47.580]  paralyzed cowards and let these crooks know look I'm gonna tell you they're
[1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:50.820]  gonna try all sorts of stuff to get the gold coming up in the next few years and
[1:27:50.820 --> 1:27:56.220]  it's not gonna work people are too awake now okay we're not good little nice
[1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:59.740]  people that trust the government and do whatever they say like in 1933 it
[1:27:59.740 --> 1:28:03.780]  didn't gonna happen people aren't gonna go along with it and all the Kings
[1:28:03.780 --> 1:28:07.740]  Horses and all the Kings men aren't gonna do so many middle class and even
[1:28:07.740 --> 1:28:11.820]  wealthy people are in gold and silver it isn't happening it's gonna start a
[1:28:11.820 --> 1:28:18.340]  revolution call their bluff head-on collision let's go the obvious things
[1:28:18.340 --> 1:28:23.180]  the easiest things for government to take is property like land because they
[1:28:23.180 --> 1:28:26.300]  just come in with their guns and they can take it but you can hide gold on your
[1:28:26.300 --> 1:28:29.980]  person you can you can you can move around with it and then nobody knows you
[1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:33.220]  have it now's the time to call nine to three sources okay I know you've been
[1:28:33.220 --> 1:28:36.220]  grabbing with both hands the last four or five days with this orchestrated
[1:28:36.220 --> 1:28:39.900]  plunge what do you got that's the best deal the radio specials when they call

[1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:18.300]  breaking that down coming up and a judge has ruled that you don't have a right to
[1:34:18.300 --> 1:34:22.220]  your own farm they said the police power says you do not have a right to your
[1:34:22.220 --> 1:34:28.620]  own farm your own garden I've actually got the copy of the ruling this is in
[1:34:28.620 --> 1:34:33.660]  Wisconsin a big farming state government is out of control and thinks that it
[1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:38.140]  owns us and the in our servants are trying to tell us we're the authority
[1:34:38.140 --> 1:34:42.300]  we're the official we're the furor we're your master and you got to do what we
[1:34:42.300 --> 1:34:46.700]  say you work for us they are you know what backwards they've got it completely
[1:34:46.700 --> 1:34:53.820]  backwards so that is coming up now Helga is a really interesting lady she owned
[1:34:53.820 --> 1:34:57.460]  a restaurant here in town for years when my sister was little my sister's like
[1:34:57.460 --> 1:35:04.100]  14 years younger than me one time Helga came over and sing a little nursery rhyme
[1:35:04.100 --> 1:35:09.300]  to her my mom always repeats the thing and I just brought it up to Helga and
[1:35:09.300 --> 1:35:13.780]  she goes oh yes I don't remember the whole nursery rhyme but I'll maybe call
[1:35:13.780 --> 1:35:19.340]  your mom sometime I guess I'll give her a number so she can she can hear it but
[1:35:19.340 --> 1:35:23.700]  Helga doesn't wonder the nursery rhyme here for us today but she's from Germany
[1:35:23.700 --> 1:35:27.540]  German citizen lived here in the US for a while came out to activist events I
[1:35:27.540 --> 1:35:30.420]  know for over 10 years met her many years ago she moved back to Germany a
[1:35:30.420 --> 1:35:33.900]  few years ago she's friends with Richard Reeves and Richard Reeves I was
[1:35:33.900 --> 1:35:37.180]  talking on the phone today and handed the phone to me and I was talking to
[1:35:37.180 --> 1:35:41.300]  Helga and I said you know I read in the news Germany went ahead and agreed to
[1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:45.900]  waive whatever sovereignty it's got left to the new quote financial union that
[1:35:45.900 --> 1:35:52.100]  even British and German papers admits sets up a financial dictatorship and in
[1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:58.700]  sovereignty in fact just search new deal sets up euro dictatorship or
[1:35:58.700 --> 1:36:02.220]  financial union will show folks some of those headlines and I'll dig out some of
[1:36:02.220 --> 1:36:08.140]  the articles actually have the day on the subject here in a moment but I just
[1:36:08.140 --> 1:36:14.300]  wanted to get Helga on with us what Helga Marat if I'm pronouncing that right
[1:36:14.300 --> 1:36:20.700]  on for like five minutes as a German who's also you know a person who's
[1:36:20.700 --> 1:36:25.060]  lived in America quite a bit who can communicate the parallels between the
[1:36:25.060 --> 1:36:29.060]  way the American people see the banks for takeover and the way the German people
[1:36:29.060 --> 1:36:33.700]  see it because it's the exact same banks exact same banking families engage in
[1:36:33.700 --> 1:36:38.780]  economic sabotage and takeover and by the way I interviewed John Perkins the
[1:36:38.780 --> 1:36:42.940]  economic hitman author who worked for them and he said absolutely this is the
[1:36:42.940 --> 1:36:46.820]  planned takedown of Europe and then the United States into this one-world
[1:36:46.820 --> 1:36:59.780]  government so Helga here we are it's actually happening
[1:37:16.820 --> 1:37:24.980]  they have to reduce wages and they have to and social security and a lot of them
[1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:33.700]  increase taxes on housing and you know just every penny they can take and more
[1:37:33.700 --> 1:37:39.420]  they will take from decreased people which means somebody said in the
[1:37:39.420 --> 1:37:49.620]  parliament today that now those 700 AD has to be have to be approved before
[1:37:49.620 --> 1:37:56.620]  increase you know before increase actually really goes bankrupt because then
[1:37:56.620 --> 1:38:04.540]  the banks can serve themselves from that money and again will not lose a penny so
[1:38:04.540 --> 1:38:12.860]  it's yeah what can one say it's the IMF every country now in Europe has to show
[1:38:12.860 --> 1:38:20.060]  the IMF the money they give you know for social programs and for everything else
[1:38:20.060 --> 1:38:25.420]  whatever the house all this it has to be approved by the IMF so we are totally
[1:38:25.420 --> 1:38:34.980]  into you know dictatorship for the European Union with the IMF and you
[1:38:34.980 --> 1:38:40.780]  know the European is set up as a dictatorship I mean the full people on
[1:38:40.780 --> 1:38:46.980]  top there's secret they do nothing in public and then there is a committee of
[1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:54.500]  all the 27 members and they get together also in secret and then it goes to the
[1:38:54.500 --> 1:39:02.540]  parliament and they have nothing to say only to approve it and then it goes to
[1:39:02.540 --> 1:39:08.180]  the different countries it takes three weeks to translate it and they only
[1:39:08.180 --> 1:39:13.340]  have then they have actually eight weeks but by the time it's translated they
[1:39:13.340 --> 1:39:19.180]  only have five weeks and you know as they are bought off they're just
[1:39:19.180 --> 1:39:27.260]  robbers there but then so it goes it's total yeah it's a it's a it's it gets
[1:39:27.260 --> 1:39:33.300]  more and more open a dictatorship I mean what now and I've actually held you
[1:39:33.300 --> 1:39:40.260]  heard Bloomberg CNBC because I listen to the TV channels in the car on XM so I
[1:39:40.260 --> 1:39:44.660]  listen to TV to be clear I hear them with this talking point I see it out of
[1:39:44.660 --> 1:39:50.060]  Europe there's too much democratic process in Germany Merkel has you the
[1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:54.800]  last lost the last two rounds of elections she's barely hanging on to
[1:39:54.800 --> 1:40:00.780]  parliament why is that because we already have that whole program in
[1:40:00.780 --> 1:40:07.380]  Germany we have the lowest wages we have no minimum wage we already have not
[1:40:07.380 --> 1:40:15.500]  got any rent increase and any social security increase they have they have it
[1:40:15.500 --> 1:40:19.940]  already done first because you know there was the real reunification of
[1:40:19.940 --> 1:40:27.100]  Europe and so they need the money and you know and then one of the also so
[1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:37.060]  already we have this IMM program already here so people are getting
[1:40:37.060 --> 1:40:43.180]  really disgusted about the the Michael and her party and you know there was I
[1:40:43.180 --> 1:40:47.780]  mean well that was the rest of my question is is to actually hear US
[1:40:47.780 --> 1:40:52.180]  media and also read it in the German English papers and the English papers
[1:40:52.180 --> 1:40:57.820]  themselves out of England to actually see them say don't worry the Germans
[1:40:57.820 --> 1:41:02.460]  don't want this but their democracy doesn't matter we're just going ahead
[1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:06.300]  with this because this will sure up the markets the bankers drive down the
[1:41:06.300 --> 1:41:10.860]  markets to terrorize the public every time they want a new bailout it's really
[1:41:10.860 --> 1:41:15.660]  a direct tax if you look at the stock market the Deutsche Bank and all those
[1:41:15.660 --> 1:41:23.300]  guys they wind up 12 points 12% yesterday and I don't know how much today so
[1:41:23.300 --> 1:41:28.020]  they're really happy about this money I mean it won't take them very long to
[1:41:28.020 --> 1:41:35.780]  kind of speculate you know 780 billion away but that's my point is that they
[1:41:35.780 --> 1:41:40.580]  own but but it's not just the money they want it's the new quote financial
[1:41:40.580 --> 1:41:45.540]  authority that you as you said that is above this is the end of any sovereignty
[1:41:45.540 --> 1:41:50.580]  that is that that's it it's not about the money it's about the control and
[1:41:50.580 --> 1:41:59.700]  finally having a totally in this European dictatorship now now I also saw
[1:41:59.700 --> 1:42:03.500]  reports the last thing that they have obviously in Europe that has any
[1:42:03.500 --> 1:42:08.100]  sovereignty involved in it is the soccer teams the football teams so now the memo
[1:42:08.100 --> 1:42:12.740]  got leaked last week by zero hedge and it was confirmed to be accurate they're
[1:42:12.740 --> 1:42:18.220]  planning on making people get rid of their teams national name and it'll be
[1:42:18.220 --> 1:42:23.100]  called Euro this Euro that so they're also going to get rid of even the names
[1:42:23.100 --> 1:42:28.580]  of the countries on the teams I mean you talk about an attack on sovereignty
[1:42:28.580 --> 1:42:34.780]  they are trying to erase it this is total economic conquest yeah what are the
[1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:39.100]  average Germans soccer games I don't watch football but anyway it wouldn't
[1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:45.340]  surprise me you know you can only sell straight cucumbers in Europe because the
[1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:49.820]  European has decided a couple of years ago that all our cucumbers have to be
[1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:58.900]  straight no more cool good cucumber so anyway yeah it's it's sad and they
[1:42:58.900 --> 1:43:03.020]  always pick ridiculous things to just train you to like yeah it's like a
[1:43:03.020 --> 1:43:06.940]  Marine Corps stand on your head why because I said so and it's just about
[1:43:06.940 --> 1:43:10.660]  training you you can't have this toilet can't have this light bulb can't have an
[1:43:10.660 --> 1:43:16.220]  outdoor space heater can't have this car it's all about control yeah it's all
[1:43:16.220 --> 1:43:22.540]  about control and it's going so fast now it's you know and that's why I'm
[1:43:22.540 --> 1:43:32.500]  saying Juan Paul has to win or or and I really like the voice of Jesse Ventura
[1:43:32.500 --> 1:43:38.380]  because when he first was voted in in Minnesota as governor I didn't know
[1:43:38.380 --> 1:43:43.300]  anything about him but when I heard his voice I thought my god that's a different
[1:43:43.300 --> 1:43:50.420]  voice from all the politicians and it's trustworthy and for all those people who
[1:43:50.420 --> 1:43:55.180]  don't know what in the world it's going on when they hear that voice they say
[1:43:55.180 --> 1:44:00.580]  yeah that's somebody to vote for you know well you're saying he is a maverick
[1:44:00.580 --> 1:44:06.660]  from the outside sure now now now expanding on the whole
[1:44:06.660 --> 1:44:12.100]  Germany issue and and what's happening this is big news that Germany is saying
[1:44:12.100 --> 1:44:16.500]  yes we will go along with this we will give up what sovereignty we have left
[1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:20.620]  Herman von Roombie the head of the of the unelected bureaucracy says it's
[1:44:20.620 --> 1:44:23.940]  about world government we played those clips the other night on info wars
[1:44:23.940 --> 1:44:30.700]  nightly news will the German people put up with this the German people don't know
[1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:39.180]  any actually the thing is German people are by now so tired they don't even I
[1:44:39.180 --> 1:44:50.100]  don't know I don't know I mean yeah they care but it's like that is so tight
[1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:58.980]  it's going on for long you know just back and forth so that just you know we
[1:44:58.980 --> 1:45:04.900]  have all this it's already done it's already done when we went we were not
[1:45:04.900 --> 1:45:11.980]  asked if we want to get into the European Union it's all done we are in it
[1:45:11.980 --> 1:45:18.900]  without you know having we couldn't go down it so that's right you were brought
[1:45:18.900 --> 1:45:22.140]  in without being able to vote like most countries the few countries that have
[1:45:22.140 --> 1:45:25.300]  been able to vote have voted to get out of it
[1:45:25.300 --> 1:45:30.700]  they're probably twisted their arms to to get them into it I mean Holland twice
[1:45:30.700 --> 1:45:35.500]  they had to vote you know they had first they voted no but then they got them
[1:45:35.500 --> 1:45:44.580]  into it so you know it's you know how it is it's the new world order and I don't
[1:45:44.580 --> 1:45:52.020]  know Europe is gonna go down like everybody else and that's my only hope
[1:45:52.020 --> 1:45:58.300]  that maybe you know something could be done in America well the globalists
[1:45:58.300 --> 1:46:05.860]  don't know when to stop and and they have an overall goal but they tend to be
[1:46:05.860 --> 1:46:10.980]  greedy individually and that's another big hope we have that's been borne out
[1:46:10.980 --> 1:46:15.500]  in history is they'll just keep squeezing and squeezing and go a bridge
[1:46:15.500 --> 1:46:20.980]  too far Helga great talking to you in a couple minutes any other final points
[1:46:20.980 --> 1:46:25.900]  you'd like to impart to the audience one the American people to go out and vote
[1:46:25.900 --> 1:46:32.620]  for the right person because all the other ones except one Paul they're
[1:46:32.620 --> 1:46:40.140]  getting new world order more of it so that's all I have to say let me ask you
[1:46:40.140 --> 1:46:45.820]  this overall though because you're on you know every year or two maybe you know
[1:46:45.820 --> 1:46:49.180]  we call you up and get you on to give us your perspective or you call in as a
[1:46:49.180 --> 1:46:54.700]  listener overall is Europe starting to wake up more to the global crime
[1:46:54.700 --> 1:46:57.780]  syndicate in the bankers
[1:46:59.180 --> 1:47:06.300]  no I mean yes and no but they are so tired people are just absolutely tired
[1:47:06.300 --> 1:47:11.020]  they're working they're working minimum wages I mean they're not we don't even
[1:47:11.020 --> 1:47:16.940]  have a minimum wage they're working two jobs they have terrible conditions
[1:47:16.940 --> 1:47:23.740]  working conditions you know like they have to be happy to even get a job
[1:47:23.740 --> 1:47:34.220]  it's just it's it's kind of I guess they're just folded you know that just
[1:47:35.220 --> 1:47:42.260]  they're just some of them don't want to hear about it anymore and some of the
[1:47:42.260 --> 1:47:49.380]  rest of them doesn't have time and it's like everywhere else people have to go
[1:47:49.380 --> 1:47:54.740]  out and vote for the right person well the good news is and for those that
[1:47:54.740 --> 1:47:57.940]  send me emails and get confused it's not like an up or down vote with a
[1:47:57.940 --> 1:48:03.540]  president there they have the parliament four or five big parties and and and
[1:48:03.540 --> 1:48:08.260]  Merkel has lost more and more of her majority and she's now pretty close to
[1:48:08.260 --> 1:48:11.940]  being thrown out the problem is we want to make sure the other group that gets
[1:48:11.940 --> 1:48:16.860]  in soon will then reverse this the problem is the bankers hold now the
[1:48:16.860 --> 1:48:21.300]  next is the Democrats and they will not reverse it actually they will just
[1:48:21.300 --> 1:48:26.620]  continue to do it no there is no hope actually because the one party we have
[1:48:26.620 --> 1:48:37.340]  in Germany they're being absolutely stoned because in the meantime whatever
[1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:42.340]  they're saying a half a year later another party will say and then all of a
[1:48:42.340 --> 1:48:49.380]  sudden you know it's let's say minimum wages this is the party I go for has
[1:48:49.380 --> 1:48:55.260]  been saying it yeah all the time it existed now because they're losing in
[1:48:55.260 --> 1:49:02.260]  those big parties they also talk about minimum wages but they will never and
[1:49:02.260 --> 1:49:07.980]  they will still stone the party which first you know came up with and it's
[1:49:07.980 --> 1:49:13.740]  with every item it's the same thing so I don't have any hope here I have to tell
[1:49:13.740 --> 1:49:22.900]  you and I don't see people on the street and maybe if we all go bankrupt
[1:49:22.900 --> 1:49:28.740]  which could happen because if the 780 billion is gonna speculated by the
[1:49:28.740 --> 1:49:35.940]  banks then maybe you know we go or bank up to you know that's what it's gonna
[1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:40.260]  take and people are gonna have to get hurt real bad by the system before they
[1:49:40.260 --> 1:49:43.700]  finally wake up and do something but a lot of Europe as you know is literally
[1:49:43.700 --> 1:49:46.980]  on fire and people are very angry hell good good talking to you look forward to
[1:49:46.980 --> 1:49:51.540]  talking to you in the future okay bye bye bye there she goes all right now
[1:49:51.540 --> 1:49:56.580]  we're gonna go to break and then I'm gonna come back and get into all of this
[1:49:56.580 --> 1:50:01.580]  news and in this little pile all integrates in together here is the open
[1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:05.740]  letter to all federal firearms licensees that they are not to sell to
[1:50:05.740 --> 1:50:10.300]  someone who has a medical marijuana card and now they're supposed to be like
[1:50:10.300 --> 1:50:16.460]  secret police and ask about it now it's state law that you can get this
[1:50:16.460 --> 1:50:20.300]  medical marijuana card and what something like 25 states now or more they
[1:50:20.300 --> 1:50:25.580]  say ignore state law and if you do sell to somebody who's got one even if you
[1:50:25.580 --> 1:50:29.300]  don't know you did we're gonna go after you and them so a new way to harass
[1:50:29.300 --> 1:50:33.900]  people that use marijuana for cancer and other things working to reform

[1:54:43.900 --> 1:54:50.300]  gave him the aircraft everything and I said to my crew I said yes I do know
[1:54:50.300 --> 1:54:54.700]  about this and I've just seen so many hundreds of cases of the government
[1:54:54.700 --> 1:54:58.940]  doing this to create the illusion that there's this threat there's one thing
[1:54:58.940 --> 1:55:04.580]  to infiltrate a real Muslim extremist group I'm sure it exists somewhere like
[1:55:04.580 --> 1:55:09.540]  a leprechaun may exist or Loch Ness monster you know in this country but
[1:55:09.540 --> 1:55:15.740]  I've seen hundreds I mean I see these every week or two and now I've heard
[1:55:15.740 --> 1:55:19.700]  government over the years calling for restricting estus rockets and remote
[1:55:19.700 --> 1:55:23.620]  control planes and when they're done they're gonna get those then they'll
[1:55:23.620 --> 1:55:27.620]  try to get a guy to have a remote control car you know little toy one with a bomb
[1:55:27.620 --> 1:55:31.820]  they're gonna take that when they're done you're not gonna have anything okay

[1:55:57.580 --> 1:56:02.100]  the Capitol and blow this up and kill tens of thousands and it turned out it
[1:56:02.100 --> 1:56:08.020]  was six black kids who'd lived on the street most of their lives who were
[1:56:08.020 --> 1:56:13.700]  Rastafarian want to be dope smokers all on welfare some of them legally
[1:56:13.700 --> 1:56:21.500]  retarded low-grade morons and they weren't even Muslims but the government
[1:56:21.500 --> 1:56:24.580]  gave them a warehouse that will give you more money when you dress in the
[1:56:24.580 --> 1:56:29.500]  fatigues and the FBI guy was the Rastafarian leader of them so they
[1:56:29.500 --> 1:56:33.700]  just called them Muslims on the news to scare everybody here's the newest one

[1:57:18.460 --> 1:57:22.780]  were members of L CIA to excuse me al-Qaeda no no they needed the Pentagon

[1:58:33.300 --> 1:58:37.020]  you after you let the bombing go forward you mean we were never in danger

[2:01:11.100 --> 2:01:17.140]  calls and stop just another illustrator of how many listeners we've got and by
[2:01:17.140 --> 2:01:20.060]  the way I really want to make the producers and the crew in there really
[2:01:20.060 --> 2:01:26.940]  start twisting my arm because I need to help maybe like hey Alan these maybe we
[2:01:26.940 --> 2:01:32.780]  need like a like a shocker in my seat it's a little shocker a little cattle
[2:01:32.780 --> 2:01:36.780]  prod where if I don't go to calls and when I am taking them you just start
[2:01:36.780 --> 2:01:41.100]  hitting the button that would actually be entertaining to me I'd like a shock
[2:01:41.100 --> 2:01:44.700]  cam it could be like a motorized thing where it's like a cattle prod behind me
[2:01:44.700 --> 2:01:50.460]  and he goes me and hits me yeah a butt taser
[2:01:53.820 --> 2:01:58.580]  because I'll come in here you would think I was nauseous this morning my wife
[2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:02.820]  was sick last night throwing up if I've got a bug I'm just gonna ignore it and
[2:02:02.820 --> 2:02:06.660]  I was about to not do the show and I thought I'll just take a bunch of calls
[2:02:06.660 --> 2:02:09.980]  and lean on the callers and I never went to a call I mean that's just how I
[2:02:09.980 --> 2:02:15.180]  operate it's it's it's bizarre I could talk for 20 hours by the way we're gonna
[2:02:15.180 --> 2:02:20.900]  do one this year and I haven't announced the date yet but next Monday I will
[2:02:20.900 --> 2:02:24.900]  announce the date of the late October money bomb we certainly need one to get
[2:02:24.900 --> 2:02:28.900]  the final crew hired that we need for this year and some more equipment and
[2:02:28.900 --> 2:02:32.060]  things because I'm spending money like it's going out of style then I end up
[2:02:32.060 --> 2:02:37.020]  spending a lot of my time on air trying to scrounge up the cash but look most
[2:02:37.020 --> 2:02:40.940]  revolutionaries are robbing banks and stuff to get their money we're here
[2:02:40.940 --> 2:02:43.900]  promoting high-quality products and stuff that's why the globalists hate it
[2:02:43.900 --> 2:02:47.620]  and try to criticize it and this idea that those of us fighting tyranny who
[2:02:47.620 --> 2:02:52.300]  don't take your money through taxes that we shouldn't be able to then sell
[2:02:52.300 --> 2:02:57.700]  products and have sponsors to fund a platform and a bigger platform to put
[2:02:57.700 --> 2:03:02.540]  our ideas out that said I do want to take some calls on all the news I've
[2:03:02.540 --> 2:03:06.940]  been covering ahead of Mike Adams joining us today we could probably take
[2:03:06.940 --> 2:03:10.900]  five or six so we'll start answering those calls in fact I guess John and
[2:03:10.900 --> 2:03:13.700]  they're all just continually ringing no need to even get the number out that's
[2:03:13.700 --> 2:03:18.180]  not really fair though to people that are actually first-time callers or aren't
[2:03:18.180 --> 2:03:22.900]  calling sometimes it's bad luck though I've noticed to just take the calls that
[2:03:22.900 --> 2:03:32.540]  are coming in even though you haven't given the number out 800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[2:03:32.540 --> 2:03:42.340]  now I said I'd get to this and I did cover it last night but you know what
[2:03:42.340 --> 2:03:47.020]  I'm gonna I'm gonna get to this once my guidance is in here with us a letter
[2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:53.500]  from the U.S. Department of Justice saying to all gun dealers if you are a
[2:03:53.500 --> 2:03:57.060]  legal medical marijuana patient you don't have Second Amendment rights and
[2:03:57.060 --> 2:04:00.860]  they want to start rating you I guess if you have a marijuana card and you've
[2:04:00.860 --> 2:04:06.100]  bought guns they're claiming that the any way to slap felony charges on you
[2:04:06.100 --> 2:04:10.780]  any any way to harass you any way to go after the general public any way to go
[2:04:10.780 --> 2:04:16.580]  after that second amendment and it's just all just federal regulations not
[2:04:16.580 --> 2:04:22.820]  laws it's like I want you to do this now now do that okay by the way this is the
[2:04:22.820 --> 2:04:28.060]  same group that of course shipped in one case alone now confirmed just came out
[2:04:28.060 --> 2:04:32.180]  this week 2,000 guns to Sinaloa cartel to knock out their competition and
[2:04:32.180 --> 2:04:36.380]  allowed them to ship tens of tons of cocaine back in that's all confirmed
[2:04:36.380 --> 2:04:41.700]  this isn't just letting some guns go to track them this is arming drug gangs to
[2:04:41.700 --> 2:04:45.060]  knock out the competition as Celica Steel and others told us years ago here
[2:04:45.060 --> 2:04:49.940]  on air I mean this is a group of lawless criminals the ATF are the ones that

[2:09:05.700 --> 2:09:10.420]  are they putting al Qaeda in control Olivia Chuck Norris who I know is a
[2:09:10.420 --> 2:09:13.260]  listener of the show he's been on many times by the way I know we've been
[2:09:13.260 --> 2:09:18.580]  sending him emails we need to get him on yeah sometimes he just disappears for
[2:09:18.580 --> 2:09:21.380]  months because it's his wife that does the email stuff we got to reach out
[2:09:21.380 --> 2:09:23.420]  another way through a publisher or something because we just go right
[2:09:23.420 --> 2:09:26.340]  through her he said but sometimes you know they're on vacation they're doing
[2:09:26.340 --> 2:09:29.780]  projects so just go another route for the publisher that that was another way
[2:09:29.780 --> 2:09:33.780]  to get him on he said it'll come on any time point is Chuck Norris is really
[2:09:33.780 --> 2:09:37.780]  really going in the right direction and I guess he is listening to the show
[2:09:37.780 --> 2:09:41.740]  because it is very very exciting so we're gonna talk about that with Mike Adams
[2:09:41.740 --> 2:09:45.700]  I got a bunch of other news I want to get to but right now let's go ahead and
[2:09:45.700 --> 2:09:51.100]  talk to Carol in Pennsylvania thanks for holding her on the air hi Alex I know
[2:09:51.100 --> 2:09:55.660]  you're tired of hearing it but thank you and God bless you I have a message for
[2:09:55.660 --> 2:10:01.940]  the mainstream media from Ron Paul supporters black this out calm we're
[2:10:01.940 --> 2:10:06.420]  doing a money bomb October 19th for Ron Paul we're also changing our Facebook
[2:10:06.420 --> 2:10:12.300]  profiles to put a black rectangle over our eyes yeah I've seen that I think we
[2:10:12.300 --> 2:10:15.180]  linked to an article about that last week or something but that's a good
[2:10:15.180 --> 2:10:18.820]  idea just grassroots movements pointing out that we know there's an attempt to
[2:10:18.820 --> 2:10:24.500]  black him out and basically cheat him and cheat all of us look anybody who has
[2:10:24.500 --> 2:10:29.140]  questions about Ron Paul anybody who doesn't want to trust him why do you
[2:10:29.140 --> 2:10:32.300]  think the mainstream media even if you're too lazy to look up his record
[2:10:32.300 --> 2:10:39.140]  why do you think the mainstream system is demonizing him when they're forced to
[2:10:39.140 --> 2:10:47.820]  talk about him but ignoring him most the time it's insane they're afraid they're
[2:10:47.820 --> 2:10:52.860]  afraid but black this out calm on Facebook and the site black this out

[2:12:49.380 --> 2:12:52.580]  wanted to say that you know I've heard you refer in the past to the raptures
[2:12:52.580 --> 2:12:55.980]  being being me up Scotty and I just wanted to mention a couple things to you
[2:12:55.980 --> 2:13:00.620]  the word rapture is a transliteration of the Latin word raptus used in a Latin
[2:13:00.620 --> 2:13:04.580]  Vulgate which is a translation of the Greek word herpozzo which means that
[2:13:04.580 --> 2:13:09.380]  snatch or catch away a couple of quick scriptures here first that's learning
[2:13:09.380 --> 2:13:13.260]  sports 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a
[2:13:13.260 --> 2:13:16.260]  voice of the archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall
[2:13:16.260 --> 2:13:19.780]  rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
[2:13:19.780 --> 2:13:23.620]  them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the
[2:13:23.620 --> 2:13:27.940]  Lord first that's lonely is 110 and wait for a son from heaven whom he raised
[2:13:27.940 --> 2:13:33.660]  from the dead even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come Isaiah 2619 your
[2:13:33.660 --> 2:13:37.660]  dead shall live together with my dead body they shall arise a weak and sing you
[2:13:37.660 --> 2:13:41.460]  who dwell in dust for your doers like to do a verbs and the earth shall cast out
[2:13:41.460 --> 2:13:46.620]  the dead come my people enter your chambers okay that's enough sir look
[2:13:46.620 --> 2:13:53.820]  I'm I'm happy to have you here and quote scripture all day long I have said
[2:13:53.820 --> 2:13:59.460]  that justice be done may the heavens fall and if I'm getting you right I want
[2:13:59.460 --> 2:14:03.380]  you to correct me if I'm wrong you're implying I'm saying that the rapture
[2:14:03.380 --> 2:14:09.740]  isn't in the Bible what I'm saying is there is not a pre-tribulation rapture
[2:14:09.740 --> 2:14:15.620]  in fact the verse you just read about when the angel comes down the archangel
[2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:23.420]  and ties up the devil and casting men and all the rest of it then all of that
[2:14:23.420 --> 2:14:27.540]  happens and I'm telling you that the church never taught in the last 150
[2:14:27.540 --> 2:14:31.620]  years but don't worry about corruption because God's gonna rapture you out it's
[2:14:31.620 --> 2:14:35.380]  like the hellbop people thinking they're flying up to the to the comment and it's
[2:14:35.380 --> 2:14:39.620]  this big giant cop out okay that we're not gonna fight corruption and praise
[2:14:39.620 --> 2:14:43.620]  God things are getting bad Jesus is coming next month I heard that in the
[2:14:43.620 --> 2:14:47.940]  late 80s I heard that in the 90s I heard that just this year and everybody and
[2:14:47.940 --> 2:14:52.500]  they use it to discredit Christianity so I'm tired of these cop out Christian
[2:14:52.500 --> 2:14:56.780]  churches following their Romans 13 out of context and all the rest of it so
[2:14:56.780 --> 2:15:02.340]  read that verse you read at the beginning one more time are you talking
[2:15:02.340 --> 2:15:07.980]  about a first Estonian's or read the first one you read for the Lord
[2:15:07.980 --> 2:15:11.060]  himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel
[2:15:11.060 --> 2:15:14.940]  and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ arise first and we which are
[2:15:14.940 --> 2:15:17.980]  alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet
[2:15:17.980 --> 2:15:22.140]  the Lord in the air and let's stop right there what comes before that Armageddon
[2:15:22.140 --> 2:15:28.340]  it isn't it isn't we're raptured and then we have Armageddon a five-year-old
[2:15:28.340 --> 2:15:34.820]  could read the Bible and see that there is World War 3 anti-Christ Armageddon
[2:15:34.820 --> 2:15:38.740]  mass slaughter of the Saints but Christians read that and go well I'm not
[2:15:38.740 --> 2:15:42.580]  gonna go through this no you know Benny Hinn says I'm gonna be
[2:15:42.580 --> 2:15:46.580]  teleported off the planet now now that's what I'm saying do you believe in a
[2:15:46.580 --> 2:15:51.940]  pre or a post or a mid-dribulation rapture well there are actually multiple
[2:15:51.940 --> 2:15:55.460]  resurrections and raptures look I'm not gonna do this with you anymore not gonna
[2:15:55.460 --> 2:16:00.060]  do it listen you got churches full of people everywhere we've never had more
[2:16:00.060 --> 2:16:05.220]  churches in this country and more abortion and more of it okay I am not I
[2:16:05.220 --> 2:16:09.460]  don't go to these churches I don't hang around with these people I'm a political
[2:16:09.460 --> 2:16:14.380]  person who has a personal relationship with God and I know God's real and I
[2:16:14.380 --> 2:16:18.140]  know there's a devil in the whole nine yards I know it I can feel it I've seen
[2:16:18.140 --> 2:16:22.940]  it I know but that's my private life I'm here to cover issues and for me in my
[2:16:22.940 --> 2:16:28.620]  house we're gonna fight corruption okay I'm not copping out I know good and well
[2:16:28.620 --> 2:16:32.540]  I'm not getting ejected out of here let me tell you something did the people that
[2:16:32.540 --> 2:16:35.700]  stood up against evil in the Old Testament did they get raptured what
[2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:41.020]  about all the rest of them the devil told Christ up on the mountain he said
[2:16:41.020 --> 2:16:44.540]  why don't you cast yourself down and make God you make your father pick you
[2:16:44.540 --> 2:16:48.660]  up why don't you make yourself ruler and Christ said get behind me Satan I'm
[2:16:48.660 --> 2:16:53.100]  going through this I'm going through all the pain I'm gonna be a man I'm gonna
[2:16:53.100 --> 2:16:58.940]  live I'm gonna be tested I'm gonna be sacrificed and then I'm gonna be risen
[2:16:58.940 --> 2:17:04.700]  you go through it first the whole Bible is about standing up against corruption
[2:17:04.700 --> 2:17:11.620]  and having your metal tested it is not about copouts my entire spirit knows
[2:17:11.620 --> 2:17:16.260]  it's a lie I can go read the Bible all day and see it clear as day and all this
[2:17:16.260 --> 2:17:20.620]  twisting when preachers get caught with that thing about well this comes after
[2:17:20.620 --> 2:17:24.820]  the Antichrist you know the Antichrist is getting locked up here when this
[2:17:24.820 --> 2:17:28.980]  happens and then they'll say well you have to go back earlier in the Bible for
[2:17:28.980 --> 2:17:32.900]  this area which is an interpretation of the such and such and so it means out of
[2:17:32.900 --> 2:17:36.460]  Ezekiel if you move it through and add this to it that there's also you know
[2:17:36.460 --> 2:17:40.340]  there's three different one yes there's the dead in Christ and then it goes
[2:17:40.340 --> 2:17:45.580]  through all at one time but I'm not here's the I'm not taking your bait I am
[2:17:45.580 --> 2:17:50.820]  not going to descend into the religious warfare of all the different Protestant
[2:17:50.820 --> 2:17:54.220]  groups and Catholics and Seventh-day Adventists and the Mormons and
[2:17:54.220 --> 2:17:57.740]  everybody just fighting with each other running around like a bunch of Pharisees
[2:17:57.740 --> 2:18:04.220]  up on the mountainside saying I pray in public I pray in private and I don't sit
[2:18:04.220 --> 2:18:07.540]  up here and thump the Bible at people and I don't sit up here try to sell
[2:18:07.540 --> 2:18:11.780]  people my ideas and things okay I'm here covering the corruption of the world
[2:18:11.780 --> 2:18:16.420]  and asking us what we're gonna do about it and let me tell you something I have

[2:24:41.900 --> 2:24:47.980]  Brantford and even read properly here so that's exciting that we should pull up a
[2:24:47.980 --> 2:24:54.100]  map and show people what area of Canada that's in I believe I know where that is
[2:24:54.100 --> 2:24:57.620]  but I need to I need to make sure I'm accurate here by the way I shouldn't
[2:24:57.620 --> 2:25:02.420]  have gotten mad at that guy earlier I shouldn't have number one I've been
[2:25:02.420 --> 2:25:05.420]  trying to get this email for weeks from the last caller so I was irritated by
[2:25:05.420 --> 2:25:13.860]  that and then he was being reasonable and he was being nice it's just I have
[2:25:13.860 --> 2:25:21.140]  so much frustration with mainline Christian churches that will not get out
[2:25:21.140 --> 2:25:24.940]  and confront evil and I'm not on some high horse I'm not saying I'm a great
[2:25:24.940 --> 2:25:29.380]  person I'm a sinner I am guilty I you know why I don't want people telling me
[2:25:29.380 --> 2:25:35.700]  how great I am I feel like I feel like crud I mean I feel bad for all the
[2:25:35.700 --> 2:25:40.020]  things I do I almost talked about it yesterday I live out in the country now
[2:25:40.020 --> 2:25:43.660]  and I'm trying to get into work earlier and I'm driving up this country road
[2:25:43.660 --> 2:25:47.940]  there's a couple cars in front of me and there's a guy in a car with his wife
[2:25:47.940 --> 2:25:52.300]  in a truck talking to what looks like a state highway truck I saw some numbers
[2:25:52.300 --> 2:25:58.100]  on it he sits there for like two three minutes I start honking and finally when
[2:25:58.100 --> 2:26:00.980]  they drive off the guy pulls over and I thought he wanted to say something to me
[2:26:00.980 --> 2:26:03.580]  I wasn't mean I rolled the windows and hey you were just blocking the road and
[2:26:03.580 --> 2:26:07.620]  he goes I know there's a really bad wreck back there I was going for help and I
[2:26:07.620 --> 2:26:11.340]  felt like a complete idiot you know what I mean a lot of people wouldn't feel like
[2:26:11.340 --> 2:26:16.460]  an idiot I mean I felt bad all yesterday over being an idiot and I feel like an
[2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:25.340]  idiot knowing how big all of this is how dangerous all of this is and and then
[2:26:25.340 --> 2:26:29.500]  I have this very prominent role fighting tyranny and I feel like I'm an
[2:26:29.500 --> 2:26:34.220]  inarticulate obnoxious idiot like some people think I interrupt my guests
[2:26:34.220 --> 2:26:37.540]  because I want the time where I'm being obnoxious if I wanted the time there
[2:26:37.540 --> 2:26:41.500]  wouldn't be guests here I can't shut up I'm like a little kid that knows the
[2:26:41.500 --> 2:26:46.500]  answer to something I'm burning with passion which is a good thing but also a
[2:26:46.500 --> 2:26:50.300]  bad thing people also say I interrupt too much actually if you watch CNN or Fox
[2:26:50.300 --> 2:26:54.940]  I've timed it they interrupt about every 25 seconds I interrupt about every minute
[2:26:54.940 --> 2:26:58.220]  to two minutes depending on what show it is and sometimes I don't talk for five
[2:26:58.220 --> 2:27:03.820]  ten minutes it's that I just tend to in and don't know how to go hmm let me make
[2:27:03.820 --> 2:27:09.260]  a point or ah interesting and then and then oh okay if there's the illusion I'm
[2:27:09.260 --> 2:27:14.380]  interrupting a lot because I'll go ah and then kind of talk real fast and say
[2:27:14.380 --> 2:27:18.740]  what do you think of that instead of acting all calm and interesting point
[2:27:18.740 --> 2:27:25.980]  love let me enter intersect for a moment ooh you know I am real I am who I am
[2:27:25.980 --> 2:27:32.700]  and nothing gets me and more angry than a mainline Christian because I've grew up
[2:27:32.700 --> 2:27:36.980]  around them I'm around it all the time they'll say Alex I really like what
[2:27:36.980 --> 2:27:40.820]  you're doing well with some nice church lady but you're gonna be raptured soon
[2:27:40.820 --> 2:27:46.220]  and you know I don't worry about a thing because it's been so many times the same
[2:27:46.220 --> 2:27:50.420]  type of woman young old doesn't matter I'm sitting there like this because Alex
[2:27:50.420 --> 2:27:55.460]  Jesus has your heart and soul and we're gonna be raptured so when things get
[2:27:55.460 --> 2:28:00.300]  worse I say praise Jesus because it's the end of the world Alex we're gonna be
[2:28:00.300 --> 2:28:08.580]  taken out of here before all these horrible times come and I'm just like
[2:28:08.860 --> 2:28:13.900]  praise God they're pushing implantable chips because that means Jesus is coming
[2:28:13.900 --> 2:28:24.540]  soon oh boy you know I guess my problem is I've actually read revelation and it's
[2:28:24.540 --> 2:28:28.940]  very clear you go through the tribulation you go through all of it and
[2:28:28.940 --> 2:28:32.420]  what are these Christians gonna think when all this is unfolding and they
[2:28:32.420 --> 2:28:36.340]  haven't been taken out of here they're going to take a delusion and think that
[2:28:36.340 --> 2:28:40.420]  this guy that's here is Jesus that's what the Antichrist does he comes as
[2:28:40.420 --> 2:28:46.220]  Jesus and defeats the enemy and they'll say oh he's here with us he was all
[2:28:46.220 --> 2:28:51.500]  arch-tapel you know all of that was symbolism in the Bible this is our
[2:28:51.500 --> 2:28:56.460]  later and in those that don't follow him are of the devil I mean have you
[2:28:56.460 --> 2:29:02.420]  really read the Bible I mean if you believe it then you should read it and
[2:29:02.420 --> 2:29:07.260]  here's the thing it's a quagmire so I don't worry about what's coming tomorrow
[2:29:07.260 --> 2:29:14.220]  for myself I just do the right thing try to do the best job I can and you know I
[2:29:14.220 --> 2:29:20.540]  am pleased at the success we've had fighting tyranny I take value in it but
[2:29:20.540 --> 2:29:25.300]  I'm in the middle of a war here and I should do a lot better job but I'll
[2:29:25.300 --> 2:29:30.260]  tell you I'm doing the best job I can I pray to God to not make me as aggressive
[2:29:30.260 --> 2:29:37.180]  as I am as hateful as I am as hotheaded as I am and God has helped me over the
[2:29:37.180 --> 2:29:40.900]  years the stuff I've gone through as of late ten years ago I could have never
[2:29:40.900 --> 2:29:46.460]  handled and so God's working with me so I apologize to the guy for blowing up
[2:29:46.460 --> 2:29:55.260]  that stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[2:34:43.180 --> 2:34:46.620]  this today they're in a big article for world net daily explaining codex
[2:34:46.620 --> 2:34:52.380]  alimentarius food freedom how deadly GMO's are I mean people say also what
[2:34:52.380 --> 2:34:55.700]  Chuck Norris this is a guy who's published in hundreds of newspapers he's
[2:34:55.700 --> 2:35:00.180]  an icon to mainline conservatives and as he starts to realize what a threat this
[2:35:00.180 --> 2:35:03.660]  is because he's in the health and things we're really starting to transcend left
[2:35:03.660 --> 2:35:09.180]  right and getting past all of these labels they use to divide us truth is
[2:35:09.180 --> 2:35:12.980]  the truth is the truth and it's very exciting that's why like about natural
[2:35:12.980 --> 2:35:16.140]  news is your nonpartisan you don't just have the pet projects you go with the
[2:35:16.140 --> 2:35:19.620]  facts in the document shows we're going to be going over that a little bit
[2:35:19.620 --> 2:35:22.860]  later before you leave us and then your phone calls those that are at least
[2:35:22.860 --> 2:35:27.780]  holding on get to you I got stuck on the whole rapture rant earlier but let's
[2:35:27.780 --> 2:35:33.220]  get into this Department of Health and Human Services document where they're
[2:35:33.220 --> 2:35:38.140]  now calling people asking for their vaccine records implying just like we
[2:35:38.140 --> 2:35:42.620]  see local schools doing that it's the law you've got to have a shot so the
[2:35:42.620 --> 2:35:47.180]  this hoax that Perry ran they gotta take Gardasil and the hoax in California
[2:35:47.180 --> 2:35:51.420]  where we're here to give you the shot it's the law it's really starting to get
[2:35:51.420 --> 2:35:54.340]  people angry and the same California news stations that said it was the law
[2:35:54.340 --> 2:35:59.100]  they had to backtrack and say well there is a waiver to a policy well you'll
[2:35:59.100 --> 2:36:03.820]  need a waiver to a policy then it's all just pushing this on people so this is
[2:36:03.820 --> 2:36:09.420]  big breaking news that you put out last night let's go over it Mike well I got
[2:36:09.420 --> 2:36:13.220]  to thank a natural news reader actually sent us this documentation you know how
[2:36:13.220 --> 2:36:18.500]  you have quite a amazing global network of people who are watching and they're
[2:36:18.500 --> 2:36:22.460]  really following if you see something say something to Alex Jones if you see
[2:36:22.460 --> 2:36:27.300]  something going wrong you know to twist the big sis's special quote there but
[2:36:27.300 --> 2:36:31.460]  we had a reader who sent us this documentation and it shows a letter
[2:36:31.460 --> 2:36:36.740]  from the CDC that is saying we're going to be calling your home we're going to
[2:36:36.740 --> 2:36:41.380]  be essentially interrogating you over the phone and asking you questions about
[2:36:41.380 --> 2:36:47.140]  your child immunization compliance and they call it a surveillance program those
[2:36:47.140 --> 2:36:51.900]  are their own words this is a vaccine tracking and compliance program but it's
[2:36:51.900 --> 2:36:57.380]  disguised as a survey Alex they say it's a survey but at the end of the survey
[2:36:57.380 --> 2:37:01.260]  they want your medical records they're actually asking to get to go to your
[2:37:01.260 --> 2:37:05.100]  doctor and get their medical records with an entire history of your child's
[2:37:05.100 --> 2:37:09.580]  immunization and they know most people get a call from the feds they literally
[2:37:09.580 --> 2:37:15.900]  you know do you know what on themselves like well the point is is that they're
[2:37:15.900 --> 2:37:21.060]  fully aware of what they're doing and again this integrates in I know you've
[2:37:21.060 --> 2:37:23.460]  seen the reports you've written about it we've written about it we're in
[2:37:23.460 --> 2:37:25.660]  California they're coming to the door and saying okay I'm here to give your
[2:37:25.660 --> 2:37:30.580]  child a shot they try to force their way in and say it's the law I mean this is a
[2:37:30.580 --> 2:37:36.220]  brazen group of crux absolutely and get to the the underlying thread of what's
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:40.260]  going on in America today is it's all about building lists the government is
[2:37:40.260 --> 2:37:44.860]  building lists like lists of people who are taking medical marijuana who won't
[2:37:44.860 --> 2:37:48.340]  be allowed to purchase firearms or lists of people who buy more than one
[2:37:48.340 --> 2:37:53.540]  firearm at a time at a gun shop in Texas or Arizona and so on this is about
[2:37:53.540 --> 2:37:57.620]  building a list of parents who refuse to vaccinate their children and they admit
[2:37:57.620 --> 2:38:01.460]  that that's why they now have the yearly census that select homes get where
[2:38:01.460 --> 2:38:05.300]  they're asking guns stocks bonds when do you go to work do you have renters
[2:38:05.300 --> 2:38:09.100]  they're in your face yeah this is the secret police and and check this out
[2:38:09.100 --> 2:38:13.300]  check out this lawyer language in this letter from the CDC they admit quote
[2:38:13.300 --> 2:38:18.820]  there are strict US laws requiring that we protect your family's information and
[2:38:18.820 --> 2:38:22.900]  keep it confidential but they don't say Alex that they're going to follow those
[2:38:22.900 --> 2:38:28.220]  laws they just say the laws exist well laws exist to prevent running guns into
[2:38:28.220 --> 2:38:31.620]  Mexico there are laws that say the president has to have congressional
[2:38:31.620 --> 2:38:35.900]  approval to declare war but these laws are routinely violated and there's
[2:38:35.900 --> 2:38:39.900]  nothing in this letter that says the CDC is going to follow the law it just says
[2:38:39.900 --> 2:38:44.300]  yeah law exists and then it says everyone who works on this quote survey
[2:38:44.300 --> 2:38:49.340]  must sign an oath that promises they will never give out anyone's personal
[2:38:49.340 --> 2:38:53.180]  information well that admits that they're seeing all your personal information
[2:38:53.180 --> 2:38:57.700]  there's many number one we already know under federal regulations the last
[2:38:57.700 --> 2:39:01.020]  decade they're already getting all these records they've got it federal law it's
[2:39:01.020 --> 2:39:05.420]  all digital standardized they're just getting you ready to use it publicly
[2:39:05.420 --> 2:39:09.860]  against you take on star they've always been listening and tracking and selling
[2:39:09.860 --> 2:39:13.260]  the data now they're just saying even if you opt out we're going to still do it
[2:39:13.260 --> 2:39:18.180]  okay you've got to physically remove it now Facebook has to admit oopsie we're
[2:39:18.180 --> 2:39:23.700]  tracking you even when you leave our site Google public schools yeah we're
[2:39:23.700 --> 2:39:27.420]  watching your kids at home the point is they're really trying to just acclimate
[2:39:27.420 --> 2:39:31.060]  now and bring this out in the open because they want to start publicly
[2:39:31.060 --> 2:39:35.500]  expanding it and and they're trying to acclimate us to this terminology that
[2:39:35.500 --> 2:39:40.620]  surveillance is okay they use that that phrase if for example if you go to the
[2:39:40.620 --> 2:39:44.060]  University of Chicago website which I linked to in the article that's posted
[2:39:44.060 --> 2:39:48.820]  on info wars they they say there we took a screenshot of it because we knew they
[2:39:48.820 --> 2:39:52.300]  would change the language but as of yesterday it said this is quote the
[2:39:52.300 --> 2:39:57.420]  gold standard for public health surveillance on immunization rates so
[2:39:57.420 --> 2:40:00.940]  they're trying to say oh surveillance is fine no I mean it's like we're wild
[2:40:00.940 --> 2:40:04.500]  zebras or something there yeah I mean they said on the nature shows we're
[2:40:04.500 --> 2:40:09.380]  surveilling with tracker tags this zebra or this or this great white shark as it
[2:40:09.380 --> 2:40:14.420]  travels across the Atlantic Ocean now now continuing of this though Mike what
[2:40:14.420 --> 2:40:18.740]  do you make of all over the country now coming to homeschoolers doors and
[2:40:18.740 --> 2:40:23.820]  others and saying it's the law I'm here to shoot you up total color of law I
[2:40:23.820 --> 2:40:28.020]  mean this is happening because more and more people are waking up they're now
[2:40:28.020 --> 2:40:31.700]  having to really come out and try to push it well honestly I think this ties
[2:40:31.700 --> 2:40:36.100]  into the recent exercises in Denver operation what was it Mountain Guardian
[2:40:36.100 --> 2:40:41.020]  yep and they just now had another big drill as well you just unplug that all
[2:40:41.020 --> 2:40:46.140]  right going in okay okay I think this has to do with creating lists of parents
[2:40:46.140 --> 2:40:49.940]  who are not vaccinating their children and I think this is just my opinion but
[2:40:49.940 --> 2:40:54.340]  I think the CDC is going to roll out a spy on your neighbor program that says
[2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:58.140]  if your neighbor isn't vaccinating their children call us at an 800 number
[2:40:58.140 --> 2:41:01.740]  report your neighbor to be a non-vaccinating parent and we'll give
[2:41:01.740 --> 2:41:07.380]  you a free years supply of vaccines maybe that's already going on they've
[2:41:07.380 --> 2:41:10.380]  already taken thousands of children we know of over the years who weren't
[2:41:10.380 --> 2:41:14.900]  vaccinated there's no law but they hype up the cops and the CPS to come grab
[2:41:14.900 --> 2:41:18.220]  your kid yeah bring them before a family court judge they're gone on a plane to
[2:41:18.220 --> 2:41:21.860]  Saudi Arabia or wherever they send them you know and they're older they turn the
[2:41:21.860 --> 2:41:25.620]  kids against you and say your parents were bad that's why this happened but
[2:41:25.620 --> 2:41:29.060]  now they just had a big drill in DC that we covered last night on the nightly
[2:41:29.060 --> 2:41:33.460]  news drudge is covering it today and it was basically a forced inoculation mass
[2:41:33.460 --> 2:41:40.300]  roundup drill and we have the model health emergency states act again saying
[2:41:40.300 --> 2:41:44.620]  that wrongs us from 2002 and 2003 the model states health emergency powers
[2:41:44.620 --> 2:41:48.140]  act that said they were going to have forced inoculations and what do they
[2:41:48.140 --> 2:41:51.380]  train in the clergy response teams the documents we got that have since been on
[2:41:51.380 --> 2:41:57.700]  the news you know they got the preacher going it's of the Lord Roman 13 to take
[2:41:57.700 --> 2:42:02.340]  the shots and go to the camp so so they are training for this well clearly and
[2:42:02.340 --> 2:42:07.100]  all of this is framed in the language of public health that if you respond to
[2:42:07.100 --> 2:42:11.460]  this survey which is which is called the National Immunization Survey the NIS
[2:42:11.460 --> 2:42:16.300]  but it's of the Lord of course it is if you respond to it you're doing good for
[2:42:16.300 --> 2:42:20.300]  public health and they're going to use this data to find out who isn't
[2:42:20.300 --> 2:42:24.780]  compliant with vaccines so that they can give free vaccinations to low end no
[2:42:24.780 --> 2:42:28.700]  no it's all part of the see something say something and you go to one of these
[2:42:28.700 --> 2:42:32.900]  training seminars because we've got the manuals and video shot and it's like
[2:42:32.900 --> 2:42:35.740]  okay two minutes of an al-qaeda training camp next is your neighbor growing
[2:42:35.740 --> 2:42:39.820]  marijuana are they spanking their kids you know are they non-compliant and so
[2:42:39.820 --> 2:42:44.220]  this is the whole army of snitches and now you hear the ads on radio is your
[2:42:44.220 --> 2:42:48.180]  company using pirated software get money is your boss not paying all the IRS
[2:42:48.180 --> 2:42:51.660]  money doesn't even matter they'll just make something up as an excuse they're
[2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:55.940]  creating the new economy is the snitch society well it's incredible this the
[2:42:55.940 --> 2:43:00.580]  spine network has now made its way to the CDC I believe and remember it was on
[2:43:00.580 --> 2:43:04.780]  your show Alex that we talked about the CDC's ties to Northrop Grumman the
[2:43:04.780 --> 2:43:08.620]  military defense contractor that's been found in violation of international
[2:43:08.620 --> 2:43:13.100]  weapons treaties and US law the State Department busted this company many
[2:43:13.100 --> 2:43:16.620]  years ago selling secrets to the Russians the CDC gave them part of a
[2:43:16.620 --> 2:43:22.060]  five billion dollar grant an information technology grant to essentially track
[2:43:22.060 --> 2:43:27.860]  partly compliance with immunizations so the military and of course the
[2:43:27.860 --> 2:43:31.100]  military is going to run the bio weapon program well yeah of course that's what
[2:43:31.100 --> 2:43:37.460]  this is just soft kill vaccines military bio weapons compliance tracking me these
[2:43:37.460 --> 2:43:42.020]  are all the buzzwords that are now becoming it's all out in the open yeah
[2:43:42.020 --> 2:43:49.220]  the answer is rule number one with the feds FBI CDC keep your mouth shut rule
[2:43:49.220 --> 2:43:53.060]  number two keep your mouth shut rule number three keep your mouth shut shut
[2:43:53.060 --> 2:43:58.380]  shut rule number four don't talk rule number five shut up rule number six
[2:43:58.380 --> 2:44:06.260]  shut up shut up do you have a warrant get off my porch CDC click exactly
[2:44:06.260 --> 2:44:10.660]  exactly because at the end of this letter which is very intimidating to
[2:44:10.660 --> 2:44:14.780]  parents because it's a it's a it's a phone interrogation and and they're
[2:44:14.780 --> 2:44:17.700]  going to check to see if you lied to them on the phone by checking your
[2:44:17.700 --> 2:44:21.020]  doctor's medical records and comparing that with what you I was about to say
[2:44:21.020 --> 2:44:24.740]  they've already got them and the feds have these weird laws we're lying to a
[2:44:24.740 --> 2:44:28.460]  federal agent is a felony so you know what I don't talk to you because you're
[2:44:28.460 --> 2:44:32.580]  a pack of lion murderers at the end they say here's a big question at the end of
[2:44:32.580 --> 2:44:37.580]  the letter how do I find out more about immunizations and places to get them so
[2:44:37.580 --> 2:44:41.140]  you see that's what they do they go oh you haven't had them you have local laws
[2:44:41.140 --> 2:44:44.780]  on that right well that's like these newscasts it's the same in every area all
[2:44:44.780 --> 2:44:48.180]  over the country it's the same script you've got two weeks to get shots it's
[2:44:48.180 --> 2:44:51.660]  the law don't get arrested let's go to the police chief that's right we're
[2:44:51.660 --> 2:44:55.540]  gonna be out here at Zilker Park this whole weekend and on Monday you don't
[2:44:55.540 --> 2:44:59.300]  have any excuse to get your children their shots and there's always more more
[2:44:59.300 --> 2:45:04.140]  more and it's all liars all liars they love it I it's amazing the number of
[2:45:04.140 --> 2:45:07.620]  hoaxes that are being run now in this country like the hoax that you can't
[2:45:07.620 --> 2:45:12.020]  record police in a public place at a traffic stop that's all a hoax as you
[2:45:12.020 --> 2:45:15.900] 've exposed the hoax that you have to have your children vaccinated in order
[2:45:15.900 --> 2:45:19.620]  to get them in the public school a complete hoax the hoax that Perry said
[2:45:19.620 --> 2:45:23.460]  you had to take the Gardasil another hoax or the or that Ron Paul can't win
[2:45:23.460 --> 2:45:27.180]  a total hoax complete fabrication with all the fabrications of the online or
[2:45:27.180 --> 2:45:30.860]  the GMO isn't linked to problems in every study they are other hoax we're
[2:45:30.860 --> 2:45:35.100]  becoming in more job EMDs in Iraq hoax yeah it's just all and growing the
[2:45:35.100 --> 2:45:40.620]  heroin in Iraq and and US troops protecting it in Afghanistan but I
[2:45:40.620 --> 2:45:44.380]  guess that's not a hoax that's real but the hoax was that we're there for
[2:45:44.380 --> 2:45:48.820]  freedom no we're there we're there to grow drugs I mean it's incredible the
[2:45:48.820 --> 2:45:54.060]  number of hoaxes in this country it's just astounding and I I detect an
[2:45:54.060 --> 2:45:59.780]  escalation really in my my own writing and in what how you're describing these
[2:45:59.780 --> 2:46:05.140]  events here on your show and it's a justified ex escalation because the
[2:46:05.140 --> 2:46:10.380]  world has gone insane it seems at so many levels imagine cops with the state
[2:46:10.380 --> 2:46:14.100]  prosecutors coming down to the town they were in and saying yes we want this
[2:46:14.100 --> 2:46:17.820]  guy with no criminal record an auto mechanic to get life in prison for
[2:46:17.820 --> 2:46:22.620]  filming cops in public it's incredible and they're straight-faced they go yes
[2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:27.420]  we want to put you in prison I mean this is total proof these are absolute
[2:46:27.420 --> 2:46:32.300]  dangerous tyrants I mean lock up your wives and kids folks I mean they're out
[2:46:32.300 --> 2:46:35.820]  there well yeah clearly and now we're gonna have I think the vaccine
[2:46:35.820 --> 2:46:39.980]  compliance police that are gonna raid your home in the same way that Marion
[2:46:39.980 --> 2:46:44.340]  Godboldo was raided in Detroit because she wouldn't turn her teenage daughter
[2:46:44.340 --> 2:46:48.620]  over to CPS and we know CP for inoculations and now and now they've
[2:46:48.620 --> 2:46:52.300]  had her and given her venereal diseases well right that's when they had custody
[2:46:52.300 --> 2:46:55.900]  of her and then she came out with with VD you're exactly right and that was over
[2:46:55.900 --> 2:46:59.380]  a psychiatric drug by the way that which they said the state later admitted
[2:46:59.380 --> 2:47:02.540]  that she didn't need the drug and and it's a drug linked to heart attacks and
[2:47:02.540 --> 2:47:05.980]  all sorts of stuff and kids but the whole you're not gonna let us put your
[2:47:05.980 --> 2:47:09.620]  black child because they love targeting blacks or not gonna let us poison her
[2:47:09.620 --> 2:47:12.740]  well we're gonna take her and guess what now she's got diseases and you're
[2:47:12.740 --> 2:47:17.700]  going to prison now Mary and with the government haha she told me also this is
[2:47:17.700 --> 2:47:21.060]  on the record she told me and confirmed much of what you've been reporting here
[2:47:21.060 --> 2:47:27.340]  over the years that there is a trade in CPS abducted children I mean there is I
[2:47:27.340 --> 2:47:31.380]  mean they are sold into white slavery not all of them obviously but some of
[2:47:31.380 --> 2:47:33.980]  them are the select ones they have catalogs you know this has come out
[2:47:33.980 --> 2:47:37.340]  they've killed people over Dinecore who's caught worldwide doing it is the
[2:47:37.340 --> 2:47:41.260]  main private CPS contractor they have a big officer I've told police they just
[2:47:41.260 --> 2:47:43.860]  laugh at me it's like well they're big they're allowed to like they're allowed
[2:47:43.860 --> 2:47:47.020]  to pretty soon they just they just it's kind of like prima nocturne which is
[2:47:47.020 --> 2:47:49.820]  confirmed like you're back to Europe thousand years ago it's in brave art but
[2:47:49.820 --> 2:47:53.540]  it really happened the noble was allowed to have your wife on the night of the
[2:47:53.540 --> 2:47:56.660]  wedding because under law you know the girl couldn't have sex as he was
[2:47:56.660 --> 2:48:00.740]  married well that night he was gonna you know have his way it's all about
[2:48:00.740 --> 2:48:05.780]  dominating us and it's the same thing with CPS but mainly they just put them
[2:48:05.780 --> 2:48:10.980]  into orphanages and and fence them out that way but there is a total trade and
[2:48:10.980 --> 2:48:13.220]  listen this isn't just my opinion we showed it the other night on the news
[2:48:13.220 --> 2:48:17.380]  cast New York Daily News and others going back five years ago people always
[2:48:17.380 --> 2:48:20.820]  asked that's incredible you've heard about their testing toxic age drugs on
[2:48:20.820 --> 2:48:25.460]  kids that didn't have AIDS no they tested pesticides on them and killed them
[2:48:25.460 --> 2:48:29.300]  they actually strap black kids down I guess because that's the group they're
[2:48:29.300 --> 2:48:33.100]  allowed to operate on and murder them and this is your government and the
[2:48:33.100 --> 2:48:36.540]  government and CPS workers went public and said we're delivering kids that are
[2:48:36.540 --> 2:48:40.020]  healthy and they're dying a week later and actually the CPS got in trouble and
[2:48:40.020 --> 2:48:44.180]  they said well it's all done under a Department of Defense thing right here
[2:48:44.180 --> 2:48:48.620]  in America folks and Jesse Jackson doesn't care look people need to wake up
[2:48:48.620 --> 2:48:52.540]  and realize that that these criminals will do anything for money this just
[2:48:52.540 --> 2:48:57.080]  came out today Alex that in nursing homes they realized that they can get
[2:48:57.080 --> 2:49:01.540]  triple the compensation from Medicare if they send a senior citizen to the
[2:49:01.540 --> 2:49:05.460]  hospital for three days and then bring them back to the nursing home they get
[2:49:05.460 --> 2:49:09.340]  triple the compensation so what do they do they have them sent to the hospitals
[2:49:09.340 --> 2:49:12.580]  and they have tubes inserted into their bodies and they have surgical procedures
[2:49:12.580 --> 2:49:17.380]  they're using your parents and your grandparents but again what do you
[2:49:17.380 --> 2:49:22.140]  expect when people warehouse mama and papa and don't care because you're out
[2:49:22.140 --> 2:49:25.780]  partying you'll be there in ten years don't worry no you don't go check on
[2:49:25.780 --> 2:49:30.340]  them you don't care so of course predators are gonna move in they're
[2:49:30.340 --> 2:49:35.300]  going to do it I mean this is how evil works and so now we are seen as stakes
[2:49:35.300 --> 2:49:40.420]  at the supermarket we are literally seen as the food by the criminals you nailed
[2:49:40.420 --> 2:49:44.700]  that that's the right term predators they are predators and the people who
[2:49:44.700 --> 2:49:49.900]  haven't woken up are the prey and the if there is a silver lining to any of
[2:49:49.900 --> 2:49:53.060]  this Alex it's that more and more people are waking up because they realize
[2:49:53.060 --> 2:49:56.740]  that what we're talking about here is true that this is really happening
[2:49:56.740 --> 2:49:59.700]  listen my dad told me when I was a kid that they kill people in Dallas hospitals
[2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:03.900]  for their organs there there has been an underground traded organs that's come
[2:50:03.900 --> 2:50:09.140]  out now yes absolutely I remember I told the doctor friend of mine that ten
[2:50:09.140 --> 2:50:12.660]  years ago and he laughed at me said that doesn't go on are you kidding me
[2:50:12.660 --> 2:50:16.260]  kidney you can buy a kidney on the black market sure you can where do they come
[2:50:16.260 --> 2:50:21.700]  from who knows but people are making money on this trade they're making money
[2:50:21.700 --> 2:50:24.860]  on the children they're making money on the senior citizens and they're making
[2:50:24.860 --> 2:50:29.380]  money look look when you're naive it allows evil to grow and grow and grow
[2:50:29.380 --> 2:50:33.940]  to critical mass and folks we're reaching that and they're gonna blow stuff
[2:50:33.940 --> 2:50:36.860]  up the false flag like he wrote a few weeks ago you can see it in the
[2:50:36.860 --> 2:50:39.740]  programming they know we're awake they're gonna see they're gonna make

[2:54:32.740 --> 2:54:36.940]  cover and go over here gosh we've already talked about the normal thing but
[2:54:36.940 --> 2:54:39.820]  you've got a big article at naturalnews.com today about this Chuck Norris
[2:54:39.820 --> 2:54:43.340]  strikes back against GMOs Codex Almentarius and government assault
[2:54:43.340 --> 2:54:47.100]  against health freedom and entity talks about the Codex Almentarius new world
[2:54:47.100 --> 2:54:52.020]  order dangers of GMOs how we have a right to labeling again I'm not always
[2:54:52.020 --> 2:54:55.060]  like on this Chuck Norris worship fest even though he's come on my show off it
[2:54:55.060 --> 2:54:59.260]  on for five six years suddenly he's talking about our government's funding
[2:54:59.260 --> 2:55:05.460]  al-Qaeda that was the headline plugging info wars.com I was just on
[2:55:05.460 --> 2:55:09.820]  drudge and they've got crony capitalism a term that Patriots pretty much going
[2:55:09.820 --> 2:55:15.260]  decades ago about Obama given money to all his select insiders I mean we're
[2:55:15.260 --> 2:55:21.580]  really having an effect here Mike great example of it I don't know Chuck Norris I
[2:55:21.580 --> 2:55:26.140]  didn't even write that article that was written by Ethan but for Chuck to have
[2:55:26.140 --> 2:55:30.860]  such notoriety and to come out and take a strong courageous position against GMOs
[2:55:30.860 --> 2:55:34.900]  which is the greatest environmental catastrophe of our time which is why
[2:55:34.900 --> 2:55:38.460]  Al Gore won't even mention it because he's not a real environmentalist and I
[2:55:38.460 --> 2:55:42.460]  do have a story coming out the system tries to make it a liberal thing like
[2:55:42.460 --> 2:55:46.220]  oh Limbaugh says liberals are against GMOs all the big environmentalists don't
[2:55:46.220 --> 2:55:50.780]  touch it but you've got all the studies where it sterilizes rats in three
[2:55:50.780 --> 2:55:55.180]  generations but GMOs cross it should cross the political spectrum and it does
[2:55:55.180 --> 2:55:59.500]  it's infecting everything absolutely absolutely by the way this big you talk
[2:55:59.500 --> 2:56:04.380]  about science being settled oh yeah I mean yeah I mean yeah question but kudos
[2:56:04.380 --> 2:56:08.380]  to Chuck Norris for whatever reason he decided to come to this conclusion and
[2:56:08.380 --> 2:56:12.100]  take this stand he deserves credit for it and by the way you know he's going to
[2:56:12.100 --> 2:56:18.300]  be attacked by the the biotech Trolls pimple ball absolutely trolls are paid
[2:56:18.300 --> 2:56:23.100]  to go online and attack people like me and like you and now like Chuck Norris
[2:56:23.100 --> 2:56:26.460]  admittedly I love it oh yeah and you can tell that we're some of the most
[2:56:26.460 --> 2:56:29.700]  attacked out there and I'm very proud of it yeah you that's how you know you're
[2:56:29.700 --> 2:56:33.820]  being effective because now Monsanto or these other companies are actually having
[2:56:33.820 --> 2:56:37.140]  to pay PR teams by the way they've been caught it's not our opinion I know
[2:56:37.140 --> 2:56:42.180]  exactly yeah they've been caught but kudos to Chuck Norris and look next week
[2:56:42.180 --> 2:56:45.580]  there's big news coming out about GMOs I know you'll want to cover it so I'll
[2:56:45.580 --> 2:56:49.940]  just leave it at that I can't I can't say it all right now but also we're going
[2:56:49.940 --> 2:56:53.580]  to be challenging environmentalists to come out and take a position against
[2:56:53.580 --> 2:56:58.580]  GMOs because how can you call yourself an environmentalist if you ignore the
[2:56:58.580 --> 2:57:01.980]  greatest environmental threat of our time which is the genetic pollution of
[2:57:01.980 --> 2:57:07.700]  our food system of our entire place and we are genetic creatures that developed
[2:57:07.700 --> 2:57:12.740]  on this planet the system is rewriting at all it's jumping into other species
[2:57:12.740 --> 2:57:16.060]  already causing huge problems and then we're not supposed to be able to even
[2:57:16.060 --> 2:57:20.100]  have a debate about it no no not supposed to say anything you're supposed to
[2:57:20.100 --> 2:57:25.140]  you're supposed to pay Al Gore money the carbon taxes CO2 is killing us but GMOs
[2:57:25.140 --> 2:57:30.140]  oh they're perfectly fine it's going to feed the world that that's the lie that's
[2:57:30.140 --> 2:57:34.060]  the big lie first of all GMOs don't even have higher yields than regular crops by
[2:57:34.060 --> 2:57:37.260]  the way oh it comes out they're big scams yeah they farmers are committing
[2:57:37.260 --> 2:57:41.300]  suicide and across India and other countries everywhere they come in it
[2:57:41.300 --> 2:57:44.620]  just destroys everything absolutely I've seen the documentaries in South America
[2:57:44.620 --> 2:57:48.420]  where they got the soybean deserts yeah and you know and just it's killing
[2:57:48.420 --> 2:57:51.940]  everybody around them anyway big news coming out on that next week but but
[2:57:51.940 --> 2:57:55.740]  definitely kudos to Chuck Norris and I hope you have him on your show Alex

[2:58:10.260 --> 2:58:13.180]  gonna cover this tonight when you're on the TV show with us at 7 o'clock
[2:58:13.180 --> 2:58:17.980]  Wisconsin no right to produce or eat food and you actually read the judges
[2:58:17.980 --> 2:58:24.180]  ruling the judge says there is no fundamental right to develop and grow
[2:58:24.180 --> 2:58:27.780]  your own food or to have your own cow your own dairy or the right to have a
[2:58:27.780 --> 2:58:33.260]  cow and drink its milk you slaves I mean I mean these people really think

[2:58:46.300 --> 2:58:53.380]  GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[2:58:53.380 --> 2:58:57.820]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[2:58:57.820 --> 2:59:01.820]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[2:59:01.820 --> 2:59:05.740]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[2:59:05.740 --> 2:59:09.740]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:59:09.740 --> 2:59:14.300]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:59:14.300 --> 2:59:18.300]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:59:18.300 --> 2:59:22.100]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:59:22.100 --> 2:59:25.780]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[2:59:25.780 --> 2:59:30.100]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:59:30.100 --> 2:59:33.260]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:59:33.260 --> 2:59:36.940]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[2:59:36.940 --> 2:59:41.740]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[2:59:41.740 --> 2:59:45.980]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar
[2:59:45.980 --> 2:59:51.380]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[2:59:51.380 --> 2:59:57.380]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[2:59:57.380 --> 3:00:08.180]  broadcasting network network okay I want to jam in a few calls but you know
[3:00:08.180 --> 3:00:12.380]  Aaron Dykes is following basically what you've told him and what pharmacist
[3:00:12.380 --> 3:00:16.500]  Ben Fuchs has told him and I've just been doing it for like a month and I've
[3:00:16.500 --> 3:00:19.740]  lost like 10 pounds I'm still fat people can see I've lost weight especially
[3:00:19.740 --> 3:00:22.700]  when I'm not on TV I'm not too photogenic I'm feeling a lot better
[3:00:22.700 --> 3:00:26.780]  except for today I've got some kind of stomach thing and Aaron has lost a lot
[3:00:26.780 --> 3:00:30.300]  of weight my wife's just started it she can totally feel it her skins like
[3:00:30.300 --> 3:00:35.580]  radiating because once you start eating nutrients you now don't need as much
[3:00:35.580 --> 3:00:39.060]  food you're not hungry yeah that's that's exactly right Ben was a great
[3:00:39.060 --> 3:00:42.260]  guest on your show I hope you have him back on and I listened carefully to his
[3:00:42.260 --> 3:00:45.740]  interview and I agreed with everything he said that a lot of hunger is really
[3:00:45.740 --> 3:00:49.700]  caused by nutritional deficiencies and once you remineralize which you can do
[3:00:49.700 --> 3:00:53.780]  through superfoods like inner food and like some of the other I bring super
[3:00:53.780 --> 3:00:56.780]  foods most of the time you brought us some today yeah yeah I'm always bringing
[3:00:56.780 --> 3:01:00.620]  stuff I brought chia seeds and and your crew is like addicted to chia seeds now
[3:01:00.620 --> 3:01:04.580]  which is great I'll bring more you're like a drug pusher I am yeah except I'm
[3:01:04.580 --> 3:01:08.500]  not selling it I'm just bringing pretty evil though bringing vitamins oh my god
[3:01:08.500 --> 3:01:12.620]  yeah but anyway Ben was right on and and once you do get your nutrition in
[3:01:12.620 --> 3:01:16.980]  you'll automatically start dropping the pounds I mean look you know I dropped
[3:01:16.980 --> 3:01:21.220]  50 pounds before I used to be pretty heavy when I was on a lot of processed
[3:01:21.220 --> 3:01:26.820]  food and I don't exercise as much anymore as I used to I just exercise working
[3:01:26.820 --> 3:01:31.420]  on my farm basically but I managed to stay sufficiently you know fit enough
[3:01:31.420 --> 3:01:35.980]  to do my farm work but I'm not I'm not athletically active at all and you look
[3:01:35.980 --> 3:01:39.820]  like you are let's take a quick call here I tell you you're definitely able
[3:01:39.820 --> 3:01:43.140]  though trying people to eat healthy food Jonathan in Kansas here on the air go

[3:02:56.340 --> 3:03:01.460]  they're being made fun of by this guy because he found out about police
[3:03:01.460 --> 3:03:08.700]  misconduct and that they were shredding their police oh they arrested him for
[3:03:08.700 --> 3:03:12.540]  exposing them well that sounds like freedom what was the name of the town
