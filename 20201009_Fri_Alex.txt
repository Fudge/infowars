[00:00.000 --> 00:10.720]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:10.720 --> 00:16.480]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you globalist pedophiles want to fight,
[00:16.480 --> 00:19.760]  you better believe you've got one.
[00:19.760 --> 00:24.760]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, October 9th, 2020 transmission.
[00:24.760 --> 00:29.760]  We are 24 days out from the election, 103 out from the inauguration.
[00:29.760 --> 00:35.200]  So the election will really be completed in 103 days.
[00:35.200 --> 00:36.200]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:36.200 --> 00:38.200]  I'm very, very honored to be here with you today.
[00:38.200 --> 00:44.760]  Owen Schreuer is going to be in studio with us and a lot of other special guests today.
[00:44.760 --> 00:49.640]  I want to just get this out up front before I hit all of the giant developments.
[00:49.640 --> 00:50.640]  I want to thank the listeners.
[00:50.640 --> 00:51.640]  I want to thank the viewers.
[00:51.640 --> 00:56.160]  I want to thank you all for your financial support, your word of mouth and your prayer.
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.800]  First number one, the financial support and word of mouth go together like a horse and
[01:00.800 --> 01:06.160]  carriage, like a man and woman, like the ocean in the sky.
[01:06.160 --> 01:08.880]  It's just absolutely imperative.
[01:08.880 --> 01:10.160]  And I did the best job I can.
[01:10.160 --> 01:11.840]  I know sometimes it's a train wreck.
[01:11.840 --> 01:13.680]  The crew does an even better job than I do.
[01:13.680 --> 01:17.560]  I'm just extremely honored to be here and very, very thankful for you keeping me in the
[01:17.560 --> 01:18.560]  fight.
[01:18.560 --> 01:20.720]  That said, it's been quite the adventure.
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.920]  I've seen the heights and the lows of society and I've seen behind the scenes a lot of places
[01:24.920 --> 01:34.520]  and this 26 years on air has really become an extreme education, almost 27 years.
[01:34.520 --> 01:37.120]  And I wouldn't have known all the things I knew if I hadn't been put through the things
[01:37.120 --> 01:38.120]  I was put through.
[01:38.120 --> 01:41.520]  And that's why the system fights around the clock to make sure you never get to have
[01:41.520 --> 01:47.400]  any experiences that you're locked up like a prisoner on a postage stamp size piece of
[01:47.400 --> 01:50.760]  property so that you never get a chance to spread your wings.
[01:50.760 --> 01:53.200]  Don't let them ever cage you.
[01:53.200 --> 01:56.920]  I've been thinking about the symbol of Info Wars and archetypal symbol of what we stand
[01:56.920 --> 01:58.920]  for, what we do.
[01:58.920 --> 02:04.720]  I think it's that symbol of the Renaissance, the symbol that Kurt Vonnegut also used and
[02:04.720 --> 02:07.880]  I think it's a bird cage with the door open and the bird gone.
[02:07.880 --> 02:13.720]  Maybe a jail cell with the door open.
[02:13.720 --> 02:22.120]  We're looking at a formulaic takeover and I harp on COVID as the catalyst for the takeover
[02:22.120 --> 02:27.600]  because if we don't oppose this revolution that they're trying to bring in and then normalize,
[02:27.600 --> 02:29.920]  we don't have any hope into the future.
[02:29.920 --> 02:35.160]  Microsoft announced yesterday, last night, no more Microsoft buildings, no more people
[02:35.160 --> 02:36.400]  coming in.
[02:36.400 --> 02:37.400]  You must work from home.
[02:37.400 --> 02:42.280]  Well, that's part of phasing you out with the AI and showing you just how obsolete you
[02:42.280 --> 02:43.280]  are.
[02:43.280 --> 02:47.640]  We should decide to keep ourselves in the loop just like we hook ourselves up to respirators
[02:47.640 --> 02:53.320]  and not breathe air and say that it's an advancement and not have to work our lungs themselves
[02:53.320 --> 02:56.800]  but that's part of who we are and it's a form of living death to actually hook yourself
[02:56.800 --> 02:59.120]  up to a respirator and call it luxury.
[02:59.120 --> 03:09.160]  I always made the private joke to friends I have who are wealthy, who get trophy wives,
[03:09.160 --> 03:13.280]  who are hardworking and really smart and informed when they meet them.
[03:13.280 --> 03:18.520]  Well, then about five years of being married to a rich man, they are empty, lazy, stupid
[03:18.520 --> 03:22.720]  people that can't even tie their shoelaces and it happens to teenagers, it happens to
[03:22.720 --> 03:26.480]  men, it happens to everybody but there's the case point example of joking that, yeah, you
[03:26.480 --> 03:29.880]  ought to hook her up on a respirator.
[03:29.880 --> 03:30.880]  She'd like that even more.
[03:30.880 --> 03:33.800]  It wouldn't have to breathe anymore.
[03:33.800 --> 03:37.920]  So that's really where this is actually headed.
[03:37.920 --> 03:43.720]  The Pentagon was asked by the Carnegie Foundation after World War II to end war and by the seventies
[03:43.720 --> 03:49.400]  they came up with a plan to actually virtual reality wire our brains into an AI computer.
[03:49.400 --> 03:54.600]  We would be born in an artificial pod, we'd be put into a pod and then the heat from our
[03:54.600 --> 04:03.120]  body would actually power the pods with supplemental solar radiation with solar panels and that's
[04:03.120 --> 04:05.400]  where this whole carbon neutral thing came up.
[04:05.400 --> 04:09.480]  It's not about carbon being bad for the earth, it's about saying carbon is illegal, about
[04:09.480 --> 04:12.480]  saying our life form and all their carbon is illegal.
[04:12.480 --> 04:15.200]  You go, God, that sounds like aliens took over.
[04:15.200 --> 04:20.280]  Well, Bible says a fallen alien came on the planet and is interdimensional and is here
[04:20.280 --> 04:25.120]  to set up a system to kill us but it's got to get us to do it ourselves.
[04:25.120 --> 04:30.200]  It's got to get us to build it and we are building it and we are enjoying it with pleasure.
[04:30.200 --> 04:36.120]  A lot of you may have heard of what I just talked about, not the Pentagon reports, they're
[04:36.120 --> 04:40.280]  public, but the movie called The Matrix, yeah, that's just Hollywood showing you where you're
[04:40.280 --> 04:41.280]  going if they have their way.
[04:41.280 --> 04:43.800]  Of course, that's just one level of this, they're not going to really have any humans
[04:43.800 --> 04:44.800]  left at all.
[04:44.800 --> 04:46.800]  Now they go, oh, we're dispensing with the pod people.
[04:46.800 --> 04:52.600]  We're just going to kill everybody except for the few elite that merge the machines,
[04:52.600 --> 04:55.600]  the ultimate form of arrogance, the ultimate form of selfishness.
[04:55.600 --> 05:00.840]  Big broadcast line-up today, please stay with us.
[05:00.840 --> 05:05.240]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[05:05.240 --> 05:12.560]  They want private corporate governance above nation-states, above religious institutions,
[05:12.560 --> 05:13.960]  above the family.
[05:13.960 --> 05:16.240]  They want total corporate power.
[05:16.240 --> 05:21.960]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Roller Ball with James Cahn and it's
[05:21.960 --> 05:29.040]  based on a novel set in the year 2020 and in the book you have megacorporates that control
[05:29.040 --> 05:35.760]  the planet and there are no longer nation-states, there are only cities that are the capitals
[05:35.760 --> 05:36.760]  of the corporations.
[05:36.760 --> 05:41.080]  Well, if you actually read what the Deimos group of the CFR, the Relateral Commission
[05:41.080 --> 05:46.200]  say in the year 2020, that is their end game, that is their goal.
[05:46.200 --> 05:51.240]  So we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless
[05:51.240 --> 05:52.240]  people.
[05:52.240 --> 05:53.240]  See us as shadow.
[05:53.240 --> 05:58.040]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and Communist China as their model.
[05:58.040 --> 06:02.040]  We must reject it now.
[06:02.040 --> 06:07.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[06:07.000 --> 06:17.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:17.440 --> 06:22.360]  It's Friday, October 9th, and you're tuned in to the human resistance.
[06:22.360 --> 06:28.640]  You're tuned in to the heart of the love of our species, all of us together, into the
[06:28.640 --> 06:29.640]  future.
[06:29.640 --> 06:32.920]  No matter what color you are, you've got that red blood and you're a human and I love
[06:32.920 --> 06:33.920]  you.
[06:33.920 --> 06:35.720]  I stand with you into the future.
[06:35.720 --> 06:42.440]  We've come a long ways, we're going to go a lot further together than we ever dreamed.
[06:42.440 --> 06:47.760]  All right, let's get right into it with 24 days out from the election when the real fight
[06:47.760 --> 06:54.720]  starts, the 79 days of hell, 103 days until that contest is decided, and then Trump is
[06:54.720 --> 06:57.400]  only a speed hump to the New World Order.
[06:57.400 --> 07:00.160]  We have to do the wall that stops it down on arrival.
[07:00.160 --> 07:03.960]  Let me just read you some of these incredible headlines.
[07:03.960 --> 07:05.880]  Most of these are mainstream news.
[07:05.880 --> 07:16.480]  World Food Program wins Nobel Peace Prize for fight against hunger as a weapon of war.
[07:16.480 --> 07:23.320]  That would be like giving Jeffrey Dahmer an award for fighting against cannibalism, or
[07:23.320 --> 07:28.840]  let's just say giving him an award for writing an award winning cookbook, or of course let's
[07:28.840 --> 07:35.040]  say the ADL giving Hitler an award, of course they do give awards to actual Nazis like Soros
[07:35.040 --> 07:39.760]  towards Senators, so I guess, well that's not a joke, okay sorry, I forgot that's who
[07:39.760 --> 07:40.760]  they work for.
[07:40.760 --> 07:47.800]  World Food Program wins Nobel Peace Prize for fight against hunger as a weapon of war.
[07:47.800 --> 07:51.440]  I could spend the next four hours on this and I'm going to spend the next segment on
[07:51.440 --> 07:55.840]  it, but this is the big enchilada right here.
[07:55.840 --> 08:00.160]  This is the king daddy of out in the open evil.
[08:00.160 --> 08:06.440]  They engineer the collapse, they run the COVID lockdown, and then they blame the collapse
[08:06.440 --> 08:12.000]  on COVID and demand total planetary control, but then there's another phase after that
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.920]  it gets much worse, so I told you eight months ago it was coming, it wasn't hard to know
[08:16.920 --> 08:22.840]  that it was coming after that, it's not pretty, but let's say some of these other headlines,
[08:22.840 --> 08:29.800]  doomsday camps set to activate through the risk of election violence, it's an infowars.com
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.720]  article, zero head story, but it links to all these mainstream news articles where they
[08:33.720 --> 08:38.920]  announce they're preparing for doomsday, the government is.
[08:38.920 --> 08:43.880]  The stage has been set for a historic national meltdown, Michael Snyder, economic collapse
[08:43.880 --> 08:49.160]  blog upon infowars.com, very well done article laying out the trifecta upon trifectas of
[08:49.160 --> 08:55.120]  evil, and you've got the Democrats blaming the collapse they've engineered on Trump and
[08:55.120 --> 08:59.720]  the American people, proper sponsor for Pelosi, she doesn't hint, she said, 25th of the
[08:59.720 --> 09:06.920]  amendment coup is taking place, and Fauci of course is involved in all of that, CNN spins
[09:06.920 --> 09:12.400]  it, Trump's getting increasingly desperate, sparking new fears for his health, why he's
[09:12.400 --> 09:22.520]  got double digits behind Biden, and he knows all of this is fake and they know it, but
[09:22.520 --> 09:27.360]  never fear, we've got the pod people are here, big story up on infowars.com, I'm Paul Joseph
[09:27.360 --> 09:35.080]  Watson, company offering portable pods for travelers concerned about catching COVID,
[09:35.080 --> 09:41.840]  but don't worry, never leave your house, you obsolete person, you non-essential, because
[09:41.840 --> 09:49.480]  we have the announcement by Bill Gates' company, Microsoft makes work from home permanent, many
[09:49.480 --> 09:54.360]  companies to follow, that's about keeping you locked down in a postage stamp size piece
[09:54.360 --> 09:59.040]  of property, they have a name for it, it's called being a surf slave, it's called being
[09:59.040 --> 10:10.160]  a prisoner, and then meanwhile Pentagon to dish out 600 million in contracts for 5G dual
[10:10.160 --> 10:17.480]  use experimentation on the American people at five U.S. military sites including aiding
[10:17.480 --> 10:26.520]  lethality, can read a lot into that, we will be looking at it in great detail, and that's
[10:26.520 --> 10:35.040]  only one quadrant of the news we have here, it just goes on and on and on, and it all
[10:35.040 --> 10:44.320]  ties in with more announcements of the U.N. getting involved in our election to quote,
[10:44.320 --> 10:55.880]  oversee the president, America needs U.N. intervention to oversee and to govern over
[10:55.880 --> 11:07.120]  America, so that's coming up, and oh, you knew it was going to happen, just like the
[11:07.120 --> 11:13.920]  leftist arms of the FBI, which is both arms at the top, always before the election, even
[11:13.920 --> 11:18.240]  midterm finds some crazy guy with pipe bombs that wants to kill liberals, we got plenty
[11:18.240 --> 11:25.080]  of episodes shooting and bombing folks, nobody even covers that, turns out the leader of
[11:25.080 --> 11:31.880]  the Wolverine militia, everybody's like, man, he looks like an antifung, he looks like
[11:31.880 --> 11:40.920]  an anarchist, well, it turns out he is, he's their commander, commander trendy, and it turns
[11:40.920 --> 11:48.520]  out he hates Trump, it hates America, it hates the police, and everything else for this matter,
[11:48.520 --> 11:53.600]  he's a right wing white supremacist, even though that's not what they believe in, he's
[11:53.600 --> 12:00.200]  an anarchic capitalist, which is what a lot of the right wing of the antifa are, the rest
[12:00.200 --> 12:04.000]  are Maoist, and I'm not attacking anarchic capitalism ideas in general, I'm just saying,
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.960]  a lot of people call themselves that, they think they're real intellectual, it doesn't
[12:06.960 --> 12:14.080]  actually operate in the real world, and of course, I mean, it showed the house on TV
[12:14.080 --> 12:19.600]  with piles of trash everywhere, huge piles of beer cans, you know, needles laying around,
[12:19.600 --> 12:25.640]  it's some drug din with a bunch of hopped up drug addicts shooting their mouths off about
[12:25.640 --> 12:30.380]  what they're going to do to federal informants, and a lot of times they'll indict the federal
[12:30.380 --> 12:35.400]  informant, and then later drop it just to protect red entity, and I said that about
[12:35.400 --> 12:39.760]  the hatari militia, and it turned out one of them was a federal informant, was indicted
[12:39.760 --> 12:48.480]  to protecting, and I'm just saying, Mr. Antifa looking dude, supposedly is the leader of all
[12:48.480 --> 12:55.240]  this and proposed it, wonder if he gets his charges dropped in a year or so, we forget
[12:55.240 --> 13:02.880]  about it, I wonder if he bails out real quick, everybody else stays in jail, but the commander,
[13:02.880 --> 13:10.720]  and then when militias are run by feds, militias are constitutional, they're great, they're
[13:10.720 --> 13:15.800]  original self defense, but when they're a fed they'll go, don't listen to Jones, he's
[13:15.800 --> 13:23.280]  a fed, and Jones is saying militias are bad, no, no, I'm saying militias led by the Southern
[13:23.280 --> 13:27.560]  Poverty Law Center and the 80 other men, and I've watched them for 30 years, I've been
[13:27.560 --> 13:33.320]  politically active, busted, I've had them try to set me up, they haven't even tried
[13:33.320 --> 13:39.000]  it in a decade, hey Alex, you're a wimp, we don't get violent, I've got a bomb out
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.640]  my car, you want it, we follow the guy out, it's an unmarked federal car, I mean these
[13:45.640 --> 13:54.040]  guys think we're really stupid, because there are dumb people, and so, but take the hatari
[13:54.040 --> 14:00.240]  militia, they were good guys, took the feds two years, they were driving to a machine
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.920]  gun shooting contest or a knob creek expo, and they're like, what if the UN occupies
[14:05.920 --> 14:11.040]  our cities and puts puttness in death camps, well I guess we'll have to get organized and
[14:11.040 --> 14:14.960]  take the local government back with some local police if they work with us, and we'll have
[14:14.960 --> 14:20.000]  to overthrow the UN, which is totally constitutional, what you should do, that happened, and they
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.440]  were arrested and charged, but even the judge said, you want me to put these people in prison
[14:26.440 --> 14:31.560]  if there's a UN overthrow, even the federal judge was a liberal and said, well that's
[14:31.560 --> 14:36.480]  what all Americans are supposed to do, but see that was six, seven years ago, fast forward
[14:36.480 --> 14:45.720]  now, it's the big headlines, oh, we need the UN to rein in the president, and for oversight,
[14:45.720 --> 14:53.200]  we need the UN to be in charge of Trump, and when there's going to be a civil war, we need
[14:53.200 --> 14:57.800]  to be able to suppress the people that fight the UN that's going to come in with the local
[14:57.800 --> 15:02.520]  police departments at the Strong Cities Initiative and take them over, of course that was when
[15:02.520 --> 15:09.280]  Strong Cities was getting announced at first, I mean this is a UN takeover, you can't on
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.120]  mainline anywhere have a medical doctor on that talks about, you need zinc, you need
[15:14.120 --> 15:22.200]  C, you need vitamin D, or you'll die, that gets banned, and they say the UN is in charge,
[15:22.200 --> 15:26.040]  and then now the UN is in charge of our borders, and the UN is in charge of Trump, and the UN
[15:26.040 --> 15:29.880]  is in charge of who really wins the election, and the UN is in charge of the standardization
[15:29.880 --> 15:37.080]  of everything, and the UN is in charge of saving everyone from mass starvation, well
[15:37.080 --> 15:42.200]  talk about that when we come back, talk about the Fox guarding the hen house, this is when
[15:42.200 --> 15:46.560]  the Fox is the hen house, and the hens are walking in the hen house, they don't look,
[15:46.560 --> 15:53.960]  it's a big old fox's mouth, they're just marching right in, and the fox is smiling at him saying
[15:53.960 --> 16:01.640]  you're going to love your new digs, hey everybody, it was in the telecommunications
[16:01.640 --> 16:08.200]  act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location, I read from the federal
[16:08.200 --> 16:13.880]  law and listeners couldn't believe me, because that was unamerican, now the media admits
[16:13.880 --> 16:19.000]  that almost every app and every company that are on apple and on droids, don't just track
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.960]  your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships,
[16:24.960 --> 16:30.040]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[16:30.040 --> 16:35.160]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa
[16:35.160 --> 16:40.720]  do, and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to
[16:40.720 --> 16:45.320]  be saved forever, your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance
[16:45.320 --> 16:50.680]  scores based on information, this is the global Chinese communist social credit score, get
[16:50.680 --> 16:56.360]  your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut big brother off dead in his filthy
[16:56.360 --> 17:00.960]  tracks, infowarstore.com.
[17:00.960 --> 17:06.040]  The bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states
[17:06.040 --> 17:11.200]  and who give their power unto the one world leader, the antichrist, and that he has a
[17:11.200 --> 17:16.680]  beast system that no one can buy and or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or
[17:16.680 --> 17:22.240]  in the palm of their hand, and we look back on all the warnings that were given, and all
[17:22.240 --> 17:27.600]  just the common sense that even if we believe in God, we're prophecy, giving governments
[17:27.600 --> 17:32.280]  and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell to track everything
[17:32.280 --> 17:37.400]  we do, as long as the recipe is a blueprint for total enslavement, and now you look at
[17:37.400 --> 17:42.760]  Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say, we're technocrats, we should
[17:42.760 --> 17:47.600]  decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get, we're
[17:47.600 --> 17:51.640]  technocrats we know best, we're now going to set up the economy with a social score
[17:51.640 --> 17:55.600]  to totally control you, you snap your fingers, we're here.
[17:55.600 --> 18:03.240]  We're just rolling it out, and a lot of people are complying with it, it's insane.
[18:03.240 --> 18:15.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:15.800 --> 18:22.600]  Live from the ATX, Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[18:22.600 --> 18:28.600]  Okay, I want to explain something very simply here, but it's very complex at the same time,
[18:28.600 --> 18:32.760]  it's key to understanding everything in my humble opinion.
[18:32.760 --> 18:38.240]  You can give these different psychological or historical names, or factor A, factor
[18:38.240 --> 18:43.400]  B, factor C, but it's really simple.
[18:43.400 --> 18:49.440]  You've all heard of the cry wolf syndrome, whereas the boy who cried wolf over and over
[18:49.440 --> 18:53.160]  again and found when a wolf came, nobody listened.
[18:53.160 --> 18:56.880]  Well there's also a problem when you're way ahead of the curve, like we've been, like
[18:56.880 --> 19:01.920]  all of us have been here in the Liberty Movement worldwide, and we're warning people and warning
[19:01.920 --> 19:08.040]  people and warning people and studying every facet of it, and then finally when it starts
[19:08.040 --> 19:14.520]  really accelerating and getting into in game, not just beta, we ourselves, the leadership
[19:14.520 --> 19:19.640]  of the resistance have been expecting it so long that it's almost like cry wolf, even
[19:19.640 --> 19:24.880]  though the wolf actually shows up, we become such a friend of death, such a friend of evil
[19:24.880 --> 19:32.520]  by studying it, we become so accustomed to it that we go along with it.
[19:32.520 --> 19:36.680]  See, that's the paradox, because a lot of people were dumb, they were asleep, they
[19:36.680 --> 19:40.520]  were ill-informed, they're waking up right now and freaking out, and they're some of
[19:40.520 --> 19:47.800]  the most active people, but those of us that have been awake the longest, now that it's
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.000]  all actually unfolding, we're becoming a lot of us bummed out and depressed, I mean I know
[19:52.000 --> 19:59.480]  I do sometimes, because it's just so over the top, and it's not like we're proud of
[19:59.480 --> 20:08.480]  ourselves even being right, we just did our job, yeah they have learned helplessness drills
[20:08.480 --> 20:15.840]  they do, and they also have situational ethics, they call it spaceship or lifeboat, where
[20:15.840 --> 20:21.280]  they do this with astronauts, they'll decide if somebody's going to take cyanide pills
[20:21.280 --> 20:24.040]  because they're not going to make it back in enough time for everybody to have no food
[20:24.040 --> 20:30.280]  and water, they'll decide who's most essential and who isn't, then you decide who dies first,
[20:30.280 --> 20:37.440]  and then once you've gotten into that mindset, well now you're just given into total eugenics,
[20:37.440 --> 20:42.520]  and so that's really where all this is going.
[20:42.520 --> 20:47.720]  We have to let it hit us right between the eyes that open tyrannical world government
[20:47.720 --> 20:51.600]  is here, and that it's telling us that we're not going to leave our homes, and that we're
[20:51.600 --> 20:57.760]  not essential, oh by the way it's a great leap forward, it has nothing to do with COVID,
[20:57.760 --> 21:02.760]  you've got to stay in your house, except when your phone app tells you it's essential, and
[21:02.760 --> 21:08.640]  the system decides what is essential behavior, and imagine the social engineering powers
[21:08.640 --> 21:14.720]  that that's able to then carry out, so now that I've given a little bit of background
[21:14.720 --> 21:20.480]  on that, let's let that burn in for a minute, look at this, sing it in, this was easy to
[21:20.480 --> 21:24.600]  say eight months ago, once they turn off the economy in the first world, it'll kill the
[21:24.600 --> 21:29.440]  third world, I guess that a hundred million would starve to death within two years of
[21:29.440 --> 21:35.760]  previous mathematical projections of Lord Christopher Monkton and others off what even
[21:35.760 --> 21:39.360]  the UN said a cutting of carbon would do to the third world, kill a billion people in
[21:39.360 --> 21:46.120]  a decade, you cut it 50%, you cut fossil fuels worldwide 50%, easily a billion people
[21:46.120 --> 21:52.080]  starve to death, that's a simple equation, probably much worse, so I said well then
[21:52.080 --> 21:55.880]  I guess this one has a similar effect, a lot of the carbon's being cut off, they admit
[21:55.880 --> 21:59.800]  it's doing it, let's say it kills 100 million, UN came out about a month later and said we
[21:59.800 --> 22:07.040]  predict 135 million will starve to death in the next year, and they said 280 million are
[22:07.040 --> 22:11.720]  on the verge of starving to death, and it's the very UN running the lockdown that caused
[22:11.720 --> 22:16.440]  this and saying oh COVID's causing starvation, no, your lockdown isn't, you knew damn well
[22:16.440 --> 22:23.400]  what you were doing, but even though you could say they were wrong, oh they meant well, oh
[22:23.400 --> 22:27.560]  now they know and they're not stopping the lockdowns, they're intensifying them and going
[22:27.560 --> 22:32.960]  we need food and we need UN aid and UN control because these people can't leave their houses,
[22:32.960 --> 22:36.760]  we need to deliver them food, we need a UN invasion of all the countries and we need
[22:36.760 --> 22:41.680]  trillions of western dollars, oh see how that works, how the UN takes over, the UN already
[22:41.680 --> 22:45.400]  runs most of the third world, you go to third world countries, armored vehicles drive by
[22:45.400 --> 22:52.320]  the UN, they run sex slavery, drug dealing, kidnapping, killing, the UN is the most corrupt
[22:52.320 --> 23:00.000]  military ever seen on the planet on a wide scale, so it's a very simple equation, so
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.040]  we ought to do this with some algebra, but you have the COVID lockdown, it causes the
[23:05.040 --> 23:09.560]  supply chain breakdown, it causes all these businesses, the third world depends on the
[23:09.560 --> 23:17.000]  west with, it breaks that down, no one will even buy the crops they produce, the crops
[23:17.000 --> 23:23.120]  or specialty crops, they starve to death and then the UN comes in as the savior and you
[23:23.120 --> 23:27.720]  sit there with masks wearing liberals going I'm a virtue signaler and you're like you're
[23:27.720 --> 23:31.560]  not saving anybody, it's an overblown virus, all you need is essential vitamins and minerals,
[23:31.560 --> 23:36.160]  any virus will kill you without them and please the lockdown is going to kill the third world
[23:36.160 --> 23:39.160]  and then they're going to get us next, they're going to have us locked in our houses, virtual
[23:39.160 --> 23:43.480]  learning, virtual commuting, they admit it's a plan to lock everyone down and say what's
[23:43.480 --> 23:48.040]  essential and when you can leave your house, I've got planopolis videos for middle school
[23:48.040 --> 23:53.600]  kids from 10 years ago that they show kids in the UK that show all of this exactly as
[23:53.600 --> 23:58.600]  we're laying it out, that's a piece I'm going to do the next few days, I'm going to do a
[23:58.600 --> 24:05.600]  report on that planopolis series of videos, but that's what this is, it's a prison but
[24:05.600 --> 24:10.760]  they call it a smart city or a smart town or a smart house and that's their own words,
[24:10.760 --> 24:17.360]  so here it is, world food program wins Nobel Peace Prize for fighting against hunger as
[24:17.360 --> 24:25.920]  a weapon of war and it shows these giant military galaxy aircraft dropping food on Africans when
[24:25.920 --> 24:32.640]  all they needed was a job and that somebody will sell their crops to, a lot of idiots
[24:32.640 --> 24:37.080]  that aren't farmers will go well let them sell their crops, oh yeah, what if your crop
[24:37.080 --> 24:42.440]  is flowers, Africa produces most of the world's flowers but they put on planes and fly back
[24:42.440 --> 24:47.440]  here, no one's buying the flowers, it's shut down, that's how they got food that was imported,
[24:47.440 --> 24:54.920]  they're dying, Africa's number one crop, flowers, oh you go oh they're growing soybeans in Africa,
[24:54.920 --> 24:58.920]  you can't just live off those, again that's how all this works, the supply chain has been
[24:58.920 --> 25:05.720]  broken down, this year's Nobel Prize, Norwegian Nobel Committee which presented the award
[25:05.720 --> 25:11.240]  in Oslo on Friday also described the organization as a driving force and ever should prevent
[25:11.240 --> 25:18.360]  the use of hunger as a weapon, that's the richest part, that's the sickest part, a driving
[25:18.360 --> 25:27.280]  force and ever should prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict, oh my gosh,
[25:27.280 --> 25:31.960]  the UN went on to say that it's populism that causes the problem and causes starvation when
[25:31.960 --> 25:40.160]  it's the United Nations that does it, so they announced the nation state and self determination,
[25:40.160 --> 25:46.200]  I mean this is crazy, everything they're doing they now say the nation state is killing everyone
[25:46.200 --> 25:51.360]  and the UN is stopping the use of food as a weapon when it was the head of the UN food
[25:51.360 --> 26:02.720]  program in 1991 in China that said we will use food as a weapon of depopulation, I mean
[26:02.720 --> 26:11.560]  folks this is so beyond ultra epic, it's earth shaking, but you see girls out, always super
[26:11.560 --> 26:15.840]  model types with a UNICEF shirt, it's the coolest thing, you want to work with the UN,
[26:15.840 --> 26:20.920]  you want to work with civilization, you want to be an international relations person, you
[26:20.920 --> 26:25.320]  want to, and they're all involved in world corporate eugenics, the communist Chinese
[26:25.320 --> 26:32.920]  as the model, taking over the planet and fighting food as a weapon of war when they just instituted
[26:32.920 --> 26:36.920]  the global lockdown that's killing the third world and the UN admits that the lockdown
[26:36.920 --> 26:40.520]  starving them and that they're the ones that implemented it so give them money but now
[26:40.520 --> 26:44.960]  drop food on their heads as photo ops and then let them all starve to death, it's the
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.640]  same UN that forces the Bill and Melinda Gates, polio vaccines and tetanus shots, full of
[26:49.640 --> 26:58.320]  cancer, full of polio, full of death, on record, I'm Alex Jones, we are the resistance.
[26:58.320 --> 27:03.440]  There has never in my 20 years on air that a more critical or important time to be self
[27:03.440 --> 27:08.240]  sufficient and listen, I don't sell firearms, I don't sell ammunition, that is one of the
[27:08.240 --> 27:12.440]  most important things you can have along with a good relationship with God during times
[27:12.440 --> 27:17.520]  like this, but what I can help you with is high quality storeable food, high quality
[27:17.520 --> 27:23.000]  water filtration all at one place, now you always get the very best deals from my patriot
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.240]  and them for store.com, we are their biggest distributor, but because of how crazy things
[27:27.240 --> 27:30.960]  are, they have agreed to give us a deal no one else has been able to get, so this is
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.480]  the lowest price on the lowest price, highest quality storeable food you're going to find
[27:35.480 --> 27:42.720]  at PrepareWithAlex.com, now they've extended it out to three days this upcoming Monday
[27:42.720 --> 27:46.680]  for only 27 days after the election and it's about a week or so they'll be able to ship
[27:46.680 --> 27:51.960]  it to you, they've got the food on hand, but they cannot guarantee this one week ship rate
[27:51.960 --> 27:56.080]  in the next month or so, things are so crazy and food prices are going up, so take action
[27:56.080 --> 27:59.120]  now.
[27:59.120 --> 28:04.760]  Computer research scientists, engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.920]  put out detailed reports at Tablet Magazine documenting what any trained eye could already
[28:09.920 --> 28:16.200]  see as plain as day, communist Chinese working in tandem with the United Nations and the
[28:16.200 --> 28:20.880]  Democratic Party in the United States, as well as the media, put out fake videos and
[28:20.880 --> 28:26.520]  total hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into the world in China earlier this
[28:26.520 --> 28:31.320]  year, then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when
[28:31.320 --> 28:33.800]  China reopened within three months.
[28:33.800 --> 28:40.480]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever, this is 21st century warfare being carried
[28:40.480 --> 28:45.640]  out through psychological means for the ultimate style, Paul Joseph Watson has written about
[28:45.640 --> 28:51.080]  it at infowars.com, myself, Alex Jones, David, I know and Troy are covering this heavily,
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.080]  this is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing how communist China and the UN
[28:55.080 --> 28:56.480]  were behind the hysteria.
[28:56.480 --> 29:04.400]  The future isn't coming, it's here, and in the future, keeping your humanity, saving
[29:04.400 --> 29:09.760]  your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset, in
[29:09.760 --> 29:15.880]  fact, it's going to be your only asset, the world being built by the technocrats, and
[29:15.880 --> 29:21.360]  the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of
[29:21.360 --> 29:29.840]  the process of taking us past investigation into total and complete dehumanization.
[29:29.840 --> 29:35.800]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[29:35.800 --> 29:36.800]  2050.
[29:36.800 --> 29:42.520]  This is their stated goal, I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you,
[29:42.520 --> 29:48.680]  but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy, we turn
[29:48.680 --> 29:53.960]  this around, you must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come
[29:53.960 --> 30:00.920]  to grips with it, you're all being incrementally destroyed.
[30:00.920 --> 30:07.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:07.920 --> 30:13.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[30:13.120 --> 30:20.360]  You want to stop tyranny, well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex
[30:20.360 --> 30:21.360]  Jones.
[30:21.360 --> 30:32.920]  Looking for adventure, oh sorry, adventure is not essential, you're not allowed to get
[30:32.920 --> 30:37.360]  in your car or get in a smart car or go anywhere, it's not essential, you've got to tell us
[30:37.360 --> 30:41.040]  where you're going, what you're doing there sonny boy, one of those women in the lake
[30:41.040 --> 30:46.920]  in Austin, can't do that, the mayor said it's bad for COVID, it's not essential, we're
[30:46.920 --> 30:52.560]  just practicing to see what you'll put up with the global estate, all right let me put
[30:52.560 --> 30:59.720]  bookends on what I was just covering and then move into the rest of the UN takeover here.
[30:59.720 --> 31:04.520]  The UN, working for the robber barons that set it up in the chai comms, openly covers
[31:04.520 --> 31:10.120]  up what happened in Wuhan, sets the example of lockdown, big tech enforces UN edicts on
[31:10.120 --> 31:13.560]  everyone, medical doctors you name it, of what you can talk about, what you can't talk
[31:13.560 --> 31:18.800]  about, they cover up their own crimes with massive unified iron curtain of Soviet level
[31:18.800 --> 31:27.760]  censorship, Nazi level censorship, hell above that, it's so intense, then they lock down
[31:27.760 --> 31:35.800]  the first world, lock down all the quote non-essential stuff, the terrorism, the flower trade, all
[31:35.800 --> 31:40.280]  the farming everything, it locks down, the third world starts starving you down the
[31:40.280 --> 31:46.080]  mass and then the UN says give us more power, give us more control, let us invade more countries
[31:46.080 --> 31:50.080]  to save people that we're starving to death with our own policies we put in place and
[31:50.080 --> 32:02.040]  then the Nobel Peace Prize as a sick joke is given to the United Nations for fighting
[32:02.040 --> 32:06.400]  hunger as a weapon of war, close quote, when they're carried out of war, but that's only
[32:06.400 --> 32:11.960]  the first part of the equation, then as the third world begins to totally collapse and
[32:11.960 --> 32:17.800]  hundreds of millions the UN says, now it will starve to death in the next two years, the
[32:17.800 --> 32:23.520]  youngest, the strongest, the most aggressive will break the borders and what you saw with
[32:23.520 --> 32:28.000]  the refugee flows into Europe, the migrant flows as they're called, organized by Soros
[32:28.000 --> 32:36.840]  and the UN is the tip of the iceberg, it will be 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold what
[32:36.840 --> 32:42.760]  it was and then as the borders break down the UN will say that the western states are
[32:42.760 --> 32:46.960]  being mean to people and the UN will build permanent refugee centers on both sides of
[32:46.960 --> 32:51.160]  the border and organize bringing the populations in and you're under UN control and that's
[32:51.160 --> 33:00.040]  exactly what's already been done, Trump into the UN control, he removed us from the migrant
[33:00.040 --> 33:06.040]  refugee treaty three years ago but Europe is still under it and that's why when leaders
[33:06.040 --> 33:12.680]  in Italy, prime ministers in Italy stopped the boats when they're out of office a year
[33:12.680 --> 33:18.200]  later they get arrested by George Soros prosecutors, this is on record, they arrested the whole
[33:18.200 --> 33:22.420]  leadership of the last government and they're all on trial for crimes against humanity for
[33:22.420 --> 33:28.680]  stopping the Islamic North African invasion of Europe with the boats and Soros paying
[33:28.680 --> 33:35.200]  for it and they've now been arrested, how's that for UN takeover, how's that for world
[33:35.200 --> 33:41.840]  government, so here's the articles again, World Food Program wins Nobel Peace Prize
[33:41.840 --> 33:46.000]  for a fight against hunger as a weapon of war, again that's like giving Jeffrey Dahmer
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.440]  an award for fighting cannibalism and here's the UN over the last six to eight months,
[33:52.440 --> 33:56.200]  oh coronavirus crisis could double the number of people suffering acute hunger, of course
[33:56.200 --> 33:59.880]  it got way worse than that, oh the crisis, you mean the lockdown you implemented, I mean
[33:59.880 --> 34:06.320]  they ran this, they're the boss, farmers don't milk, break eggs, this coronavirus restaurant
[34:06.320 --> 34:11.720]  closes destroyed demand, I've never seen anything like this, shippers using west coast ports
[34:11.720 --> 34:18.120]  can't block rail, BNSF and Union Pacific, a Nigerian farmer's murder shows food security
[34:18.120 --> 34:23.920]  at tipping point, the coronavirus could double severe hunger around the world to 265 million
[34:23.920 --> 34:31.480]  without swift UN action, oh business insider, the very group running it, and it goes on
[34:31.480 --> 34:35.480]  and on and on, instead of coronavirus the hunger will kill us, the global food crisis
[34:35.480 --> 34:39.760]  looms, that was back in April, oh but don't worry the UN just got an award for fighting
[34:39.760 --> 34:47.400]  food as a weapon, as they use it as a weapon, I mean like if I brought a puppy in here and
[34:47.400 --> 34:53.520]  got that sword hypothetically and chopped its head off and then the S, whatever it's
[34:53.520 --> 35:00.600]  called, the dog and cat association, whatever it is, SSPCA, whatever they're called, it'd
[35:00.600 --> 35:04.680]  be like if I brought a puppy in here, I would never do that, I love dogs hypothetically,
[35:04.680 --> 35:09.840]  chopped its head off, getting an award from the local animal rights group, that's how
[35:09.840 --> 35:15.440]  crazy this is, I mean the UN publicly runs the lockdown, publicly says they want to depopulate,
[35:15.440 --> 35:19.520]  publicly are caught out in the vaccines, publicly are running these blockades, publicly are
[35:19.520 --> 35:24.160]  blocking good medicines going into Africa, publicly blew up Libya, publicly overthrew
[35:24.160 --> 35:28.880]  all of their countries to make it destabilized, then publicly organize the collapse of our
[35:28.880 --> 35:39.520]  borders, but they're the good guys, and it goes on and on and on, alright, but what's
[35:39.520 --> 35:47.720]  the left answer, oh eat bugs, so there you go folks, the UN gets an award, it'd be like
[35:47.720 --> 35:54.600]  again, Hitler getting an award from Israel, like imagine if Benjamin Netanyahu today said
[35:54.600 --> 36:00.040]  we're giving Adolf Hitler posthumously the highest Israeli award, whatever that is, I
[36:00.040 --> 36:07.280]  mean it's just, it's like Superman giving an award to Lex Luthor, I mean it's just complete
[36:07.280 --> 36:12.160]  inversion in your face in a sick joke, and I sit there and I talk to people that are
[36:12.160 --> 36:16.480]  competent in business or whatever and they just laugh at me and they go oh Alex, nothing's
[36:16.480 --> 36:20.520]  happening in the third world, everything's fine, oh the UN doesn't run the coronavirus
[36:20.520 --> 36:23.560]  response, even though they publicly do, I can watch congressional hearings, they admit
[36:23.560 --> 36:28.540]  it all, I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back and hit a lot of other really
[36:28.540 --> 36:35.840]  important news, we've got again the supposed militia commander up there is a Antifa individual
[36:35.840 --> 36:44.320]  that hates Trump, police in America and the Republican Party, but he is the guy that was
[36:44.320 --> 36:50.320]  going to get Queenie Whitmer, by the way I would have covered the food story as our
[36:50.320 --> 36:54.120]  top story regardless of the fact we're running a giant sale on high-quality swarble food,
[36:54.120 --> 36:57.840]  but I think it is an example of why you do want high-quality swarble food going into
[36:57.840 --> 37:02.240]  this contested election, going into the worldwide breakdown of the food supply and the delivery
[37:02.240 --> 37:07.920]  chain and the supply chain, I would go to preparadalex.com, this is the final time,
[37:07.920 --> 37:11.760]  they haven't done a special in over five years, they've extended it a week and now three more
[37:11.760 --> 37:17.680]  days at preparadalex.com, they have a one year, six month and one month supplies, all
[37:17.680 --> 37:26.840]  massively discounted, they're already massively discounted prices, two days, 17 hours, four
[37:26.840 --> 37:30.000]  minutes for you to get that and then that is it for the specials, you already find the
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.880]  lowest prices on their full catalog at inforwarstore.com, they can get around some of the contracts
[37:34.880 --> 37:39.160]  and agreements they have with other suppliers, other distributors if they do this specialty
[37:39.160 --> 37:45.120]  event that's limited, so it's those items and a few other really cool items at preparadalex.com
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.960]  that are already discounted but then discounted even more, it is ridiculous, preparadalex.com
[37:49.960 --> 37:54.880]  and then a portion of that goes to fund our operation.

[38:09.040 --> 38:12.560]  triple what we normally bring in and that's a good extra bump for us to be able to budget

[41:00.320 --> 41:04.360]  knows we need to be self sufficient, everyone with half a brain knows you need to have durable
[41:04.360 --> 41:09.240]  food that's high quality, nutritious and lasts a long time, we've got the best sponsor,
[41:09.240 --> 41:12.600]  they've got the food, they're ready to ship it to you but they're going to have to go
[41:12.600 --> 41:17.240]  up on prices in the next few months because of the shortages that have begun, they have
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.240]  the food on hand, they're ready to ship it out within a week to a week and a half but
[41:21.240 --> 41:27.680]  not for much longer so they are allowing us this last time big deal, it's been extended
[41:27.680 --> 41:35.240]  three days, specials on top of their biggest specials ever and preparewithalex.com, preparewithalex.com
[41:35.240 --> 41:40.520]  has even better deals than infoorcestore.com, we're their biggest distributor so contractually
[41:40.520 --> 41:43.960]  we have to sell at the same price that they sell at the distributors do, this is already
[41:43.960 --> 41:50.600]  a great deal but and preparewithalex.com they're able to do a promotion on one year, six months
[41:50.600 --> 41:54.760]  and three months supplies, six hundred bucks off on a year and it goes from there, go to
[41:54.760 --> 42:04.120]  preparewithalex.com and perhaps most cruelly of all if Donald Trump has his way the complications
[42:04.120 --> 42:12.680]  from COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that two hundred
[42:12.680 --> 42:18.920]  million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk, Joe Biden has always been
[42:18.920 --> 42:25.320]  a congenital liar, part of the establishment for close to 50 years but now boy as this
[42:25.320 --> 42:32.120]  brain degenerates we are seeing walking public dimension on the biggest stage of the world,
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.840]  the 2020 election, there are three hundred and seventy million people in the united states,
[42:36.840 --> 42:42.120]  if two hundred million died from COVID that'd be more than half of the population when not even
[42:42.120 --> 42:47.960]  one tenth of one percent have actually died but him putting these giant lies and these incredibly
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.840]  brain damaged statements out is emblematic of the general public being in a trance,
[42:52.840 --> 43:18.920]  how is anyone even putting up with this, it is beyond bizarre.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.160]  The exact same videos we can comment, we can share them everything, the system
[43:28.040 --> 43:33.640]  is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago, Trump has finally
[43:33.640 --> 43:37.880]  figured this out and since he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech I mean
[43:37.880 --> 43:41.080]  he's modern in the situation, well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're going
[43:41.080 --> 43:45.880]  to sit here and cry because he has taken action, we the people are taking action now and you can
[43:45.880 --> 43:51.000]  do it very very easily by sharing 2020electioncenter.com, 2020electioncenter.com and checking out the
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.280]  new redesigned infomores.com and sharing that link, hope that's really upset some oh yeah.
[44:00.040 --> 44:02.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:14.920 --> 44:18.680]  All right here we are in the final segment of this hour, Owen Shroyer's coming in,
[44:18.680 --> 44:23.960]  I've got a emergency it's like last Friday, family matter I have to attend to part of the
[44:23.960 --> 44:29.960]  ongoing harassment that info wars goes through and then I'll be back in the third and fourth hours
[44:29.960 --> 44:35.720]  today but Owen's going to knock it out of the park really appreciate Owen Shroyer about to take over
[44:36.360 --> 44:42.280]  the big news is doomsday camps set to activate due to the risk of election violence I'll be covering
[44:42.280 --> 44:49.720]  that info wars.com and zero hedge.com report from zero hedge.com coming up in the third hour that
[44:49.720 --> 44:56.840]  is a big big big big deal also the ongoing announcements there's more articles Boston
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.960]  Globe you name it oh we need the UN to run our election oh we need the UN to have oversight what's
[45:01.960 --> 45:09.160]  the word yeah oversight meaning governance over the president oh Governor Whitmer oh you know
[45:09.160 --> 45:14.840]  the the Supreme Court of her state said she's a tyrant grabbed all the power she's out of control
[45:14.840 --> 45:20.120]  she announced a new tyrannical power grab and then magically they find the leftist group
[45:20.120 --> 45:24.280]  that would look like total drug addicts led by a commander that's Antifa
[45:26.280 --> 45:33.960]  anarchist well here just just to just hear from him this is Brandon Caserta here he is here's a
[45:33.960 --> 45:44.920]  few club seven and it's it's amazes me that people actually like believe that when he's shown over
[45:44.920 --> 45:52.280]  and over and over again that he's a tyrant every single person that works for government is your
[45:52.280 --> 46:03.720]  enemy dude you know and um they were literally violently thrown out of there okay now they weren't
[46:03.720 --> 46:10.840]  violently thrown out of there by any of the bureaucrats or politicians that's not who did it
[46:10.840 --> 46:18.920]  it wasn't a lawmaker who threw them out okay it wasn't a governor you know it wasn't a secretary
[46:18.920 --> 46:30.760]  of state it was an order following police officer okay and i'm going to show you some some case law
[46:30.760 --> 46:43.000]  right now that will kind of guide you to the realization that these order followers are not
[46:43.000 --> 46:50.200]  here to protect you at all and i really really really want to try to get you to understand that
[46:50.200 --> 46:56.840]  because you are not going to achieve freedom by continuing to support these people under the
[46:56.840 --> 47:03.720]  erroneous belief that they're here to protect you that's just incorrect and we can you know
[47:03.720 --> 47:09.560]  trump is not your friend dude all right that's enough of him it goes on for hours but the point
[47:09.560 --> 47:13.080]  is obviously the police can be out of control obviously there's too big a government a lot of
[47:13.080 --> 47:18.120]  times but we have a local constabulary we create a government limited to when a crime is committed
[47:18.120 --> 47:22.520]  people get punished does it get out of control absolutely but to say the police are what you
[47:22.520 --> 47:27.720]  overthrow it's not the government the police well that means he wants to be the police when
[47:27.720 --> 47:31.720]  everybody says oh we we're going to be the police now you you know what's happening no you need to
[47:31.720 --> 47:36.840]  change the government change the laws that's how you change the police you don't change the police
[47:36.840 --> 47:43.080]  by shooting one in the head or you know kidnapping the governor or any of this that helps that monster
[47:43.080 --> 47:48.360]  witch so trump's come out and expose it pointed out what a giant fraud it is we got a bunch of
[47:48.360 --> 47:53.320]  other news coming up next debate moderator asked former white house communications director should
[47:53.320 --> 47:57.480]  have responded trump he obviously thought it was a private message steve scully what a piece of
[47:57.480 --> 48:02.280]  garbage uh he's a big anti-trump or never trump or an accidentally sent out that private message
[48:02.280 --> 48:06.360]  publicly they're all just a bunch of scheming cowards and they've got all these fake polls
[48:06.360 --> 48:09.960]  out that trump isn't going to lose all the internal poll show is going to win that's why
[48:09.960 --> 48:13.960]  they're saying they're going to contest it try to split the country up and bring the un in and
[48:13.960 --> 48:20.120]  have secession that's in the new york times that's crazy they're trying to just normalize all this
[48:20.120 --> 48:25.080]  craziness but if you can add two plus two equals four they're done like the un does the lockdown
[48:25.080 --> 48:29.400]  the un runs the censorship the un says the third world has to starve to death but then says oh
[48:29.400 --> 48:36.040]  they're starving to death and gets an award for stopping using food as a weapon unbelievable

[52:34.040 --> 52:39.560]  putting up with it now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude

[52:45.400 --> 52:51.720]  using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation and layman's terms they are manipulating
[52:51.720 --> 52:56.440]  the fact that we adapt to being oppressed we adapt to being pressed with the low dosages
[52:56.440 --> 53:02.760]  of oppression now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to the poison

[53:46.520 --> 53:51.400]  me into an insincere person in the straw man a person that cares about life and children and
[53:51.400 --> 53:56.280]  is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children and then they build me into this lie
[53:56.280 --> 54:01.720]  to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about alex
[54:01.720 --> 54:08.440]  joe so even if i didn't sell out to them they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the

[57:25.480 --> 57:31.000]  the war room later and i'll be getting into a lot of this news then what is the big story all the
[57:31.000 --> 57:40.280]  the different layers of protection of the deep state all the different as nasa policy said
[57:40.280 --> 57:49.320]  arrows in the quiver of the deep state as we have now found out revolver dot news today working to
[57:49.880 --> 57:55.880]  replace drudge formerly the great drudge report that's their goal came out with this exclusive
[57:55.880 --> 58:02.360]  today rigged the chairman of the presidential debate commission is co-founder of color revolution
[58:02.360 --> 58:14.760]  org linked to steel dossier and more and so this whole thing i mean i'm going to be covering it on
[58:14.760 --> 58:19.480]  the war room i haven't had time to go through all that i believe there may also be a soros connection
[58:19.480 --> 58:29.640]  but the point is just another layer of the deep state they're in control of the presidential
[58:29.640 --> 58:35.720]  debate commission oh no wonder you had chris wallis a democrat debating trump in the first debate
[58:37.320 --> 58:40.520]  no wonder they allowed biden to back out and then said no it was trump
[58:42.600 --> 58:44.120]  another layer of the deep state
[58:44.120 --> 58:53.880]  was the president of the united states was the white house targeted for covet
[58:56.680 --> 59:02.600]  or do you believe this report or do you believe the positive tests 34 people connected to white
[59:02.600 --> 59:11.320]  house are infected with covet according to leaked fema report leaked fema report
[59:11.320 --> 59:18.840]  kaley mac and any tested positive for covet hasn't even shown a symptom trump's already over it
[59:23.400 --> 59:26.920]  and you know there's a story here that trump mentioned that nobody's really picking up
[59:28.760 --> 59:33.480]  and it's just uh it's just really it is kind of just like trump where he's not even making a big
[59:33.480 --> 59:39.560]  deal of this it's like he makes a big deal that wants and then he moves on foul she says
[59:39.560 --> 59:46.920]  reasonably good chance regeneron antibody therapy helped trump so trump literally got to waltz
[59:46.920 --> 59:49.720]  reading they're like yeah here's what we're doing they're like what do what do you have here what is
[59:49.720 --> 59:53.320]  this what's it like well we're not sure about this kind of experimental he's like just give it to me
[59:53.320 --> 1:00:00.040]  i'll take it let's go and it worked and everybody was freaking out like what is this cocktail he
[1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:04.360]  could die it's not good and he said screw it i gotta get back to work give me the damn thing
[1:00:04.360 --> 1:00:14.920]  and i think he's now fully recovered it's later to begin campaign activities this weekend or
[1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:21.400]  begin again if you will but here's what i think i'm going to get into on the other side and then
[1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:24.840]  maybe just open up the phone calls to get your take on this because i had a call on this last
[1:00:24.840 --> 1:00:31.560]  night and then alex jones will be right back this is from foxworth for congress he's he's running
[1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:39.800]  here in texas almost four years after we were told that justice is coming the proud boys q and on
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:45.880]  alex jones the red elephants mollinue and numerous others are gone not one single indictment has been
[1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:55.480]  brought forward against the deep state so you know it just makes you wonder doesn't it this is over
[1:00:55.480 --> 1:00:58.840]  stop pretending this is a legit system this individual is running for congress boy that's
[1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:04.120]  kind of person we need in headline from the gateway pundit today bill bar gives china joe a kiss
[1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:09.800]  it's exactly what they did it's exactly what bill bar did maybe even a little more maybe a rug a
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:18.360]  rub and tug ag tells gop leaders doj investigation into obama gate scandal won't be released until
[1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:27.640]  after the election yeah that's that's a good rub and tug right there that's not a kiss that's a happy
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:35.320]  ending and then the troll from russia you know i'm actually pissed that putin would did this but he
[1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:40.120]  doesn't even care i mean the russian humor at this point funnier in american humor putin says he
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:48.360]  wants to work with biden claims shared values between democrats and communism you bastard putin
[1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:53.560]  you bastard why did you do this to us they're gonna use this joke against us damn it
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:02:01.560]  for more than a hundred years the rockefeller foundation has worked to establish world government
[1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:06.920]  abolish nation states dumb down the population by taking control of education and most importantly
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:13.400]  taking control of western medicine now they had a bad name by the 1920s they started converting
[1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:19.560]  over and funding other organizations and groups like ibm to continue on with their eugenics
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:25.880]  operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by ibm via his mother on the board of
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:31.720]  directors to bill gates the third his father of course being had a planned parenthood and now
[1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:37.800]  he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world every national
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:44.680]  health system bill gates is in control they have spent a hundred plus years getting positioned
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:50.440]  to be able to control what happens to your body when it goes in your body this is the holy grail
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:55.400]  of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of dna in your body
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:11.800]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:19.480]  and now your host owin shroyer i got something to tell me what it's all about
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:24.920]  i'm thinking about opening up the phone lines and asking you

[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:36.520]  we have all the evidence what are we waiting for
[1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:45.720]  and what bill bar can do now it appears he's not going to do
[1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:52.280]  bill the headlines on the gateway punted is bill bar gives china joe a kiss
[1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:57.240]  and you know what i think i need to make a i'm going to become the editor in chief for a moment
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:04:02.520]  here for the gateway punted i'm sorry uh sorry jim hoff i just uh i'm just gonna have to re-edit
[1:04:02.520 --> 1:04:08.920]  this headline for you bill bar gives china joe a happy ending
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:16.120]  that's the pg version
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:23.880]  attorney general tells gop leaders department of justice investigation into obama gates
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:33.720]  obama gate scandal won't be released until after the election oh oh you were that close
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:43.560]  to justice america you were that close to knowing the truth you were that close to finally taking
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:51.640]  down the deep state but no a lost bill bar reached under the table and gave joe biden's
[1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:59.400]  campaign a rub and tug and said don't worry about those scandals don't worry about the trees and
[1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:12.280]  don't worry about obama gate no we've got your back you're gonna stay out of prison for at least
[1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:24.840]  another month and then their excuse is we don't want to meddle in the election oh so let me get
[1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:30.840]  this straight you caught the obama campaign and the democrats meddling in the election red-handed
[1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:39.080]  and we've all seen the documents now but you don't want to go after them
[1:05:39.080 --> 1:05:45.400]  them because you don't want to meddle in the election oh
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:51.960]  okay
[1:05:56.680 --> 1:06:01.640]  so i had a caller last night asked me what we should do about this is it time to start calling for
[1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:05.880]  the ousting of bar because now haspel and ray have all the momentum against them
[1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:09.480]  them they're not going to be lasting much longer
[1:06:13.320 --> 1:06:17.240]  but people with bar there's been some support for bar a lot of people really like bar people
[1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:24.520]  have high expectations for bar did bar just reveal himself as a deep state agent you have
[1:06:24.520 --> 1:06:27.640]  any faith left in bill bar anymore
[1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:35.160]  because this is clearly a move to sabotage trump
[1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:44.280]  i mean i don't know how else you can really measure this this is clearly a move to sabotage
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:51.640]  president dylan j trump protecting the people that went after him making sure
[1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:58.680]  or biden can run a clean campaign without all of his scandal and corruption getting in the way
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:09.000]  yeah i think it's sad
[1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:16.200]  but i think bill bar has shown now his true colors
[1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:24.200]  i think bill bar he's done some nice tv interviews he said some nice things he's had some nice
[1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:32.280]  meme magic he hasn't been a total rat but at the end of the day what did he do
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:38.360]  he just set a screen for joe biden he just allued joe biden
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:49.640]  so that's a total sabotage of president trump that's a total sabotage of justice
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:53.480]  and that's a total spit in the eye
[1:07:55.880 --> 1:07:58.280]  of us of you of the american people
[1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:03.080]  and it's really just getting so out of control at this point
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:12.280]  i just i don't know what i don't know what the president has to do i don't know what we have
[1:08:12.280 --> 1:08:16.360]  to do but this is ridiculous col written house is still rotting in jail in fact let's sum it up
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:26.120]  in one short clip do we have that clip edited yet guys censored the de Blasio okay this lady sums it up
[1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:35.000]  nicely but it really is the encapsulation of the clown world that we're in right now
[1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:41.640]  it's the encapsulation of the madness of democrat party politics and what we're putting up with
[1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:48.760]  and this is on a very kind of mid-level it's not the lowest level it's not the highest level
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:55.720]  it's kind of mid-level that we can all relate to so is it censored now guys so listen to this lady
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:09:01.560]  i'm not sure who she is this clip just going viral in new york bill de Blasio was on the
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:07.960]  television news this morning and here was her response hey maids de Blasio i saw you today

[1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:33.240]  protesting their own confined environment because you shut them down but you know i went antifa
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:37.080]  was running around new york city and they were burning down businesses and they were taking
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:41.160]  away from the tax paying people that owned businesses here you did nothing you're making
[1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:48.280]  certain was painting a thing on the street you didn't care but now you give a you took away

[1:09:55.640 --> 1:10:03.400]  you need a mental evaluation you freaking clown pretty much sums it up doesn't it
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:10.600]  bill de Blasio is finger painting while the city burns to the ground businesses are leaving
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:17.000]  people are moving out in droves and he's finger painting on the street while his daughter has a
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:22.360]  an only fans uh i won't go after the daughter but she's a she's a commie protester she she
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:29.560]  likes to you know post naked for commies and this clown is putting on a face mask he says
[1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:33.560]  trump should trump was on a balcony without a face mask and then he does a photo shoot and he
[1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:38.120]  literally is out on a balcony without a face mask so that he can have the photo shoot of putting one
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:49.720]  on i mean seriously folks we we've got to start asking ourselves some real questions here
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:56.200]  and you know i see the i was always going to make a little joke there about like is michelle
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:00.120]  obama a man but i was like you know what don't do that you got to be serious here but but then
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:06.120]  it hit that's actually it it's not much isn't michelle obama a man or not it's who are these
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:14.760]  people who really are these people is bill de Blasio really a 13 iq dumbass or is he intentionally
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:20.040]  sabotaging is he is he is a communist agent is he blackmailed i mean we need to seriously start
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:24.200]  asking ourselves some questions here but the people that ask the questions like alex jones
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:30.200]  and no insurer they get banned everywhere see so maybe the questions we're asking are the right
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:40.680]  questions imagine you're in new york city and it's burning to the ground you can't even go out of
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:45.160]  new york right now you you may get mugged you're gonna get mugged and you're gonna get robbed
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:52.200]  businesses are out of business leaving town people are leaving town
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:59.720]  and de Blasio is literally face painting uh finger painting on the street black lives matter
[1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:05.720]  putting on a mask for coveted when he's with no one's within a hundred yards of him
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:15.960]  this is a clown world and it's time we start asking who are these clowns who is bill de Blasio
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:24.680]  who is attorney general bar that can't even get an indictment can't even make a move

[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:40.840]  you know the only measurement i can figure that trump is making is he's hoping that 2020 is such
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:45.720]  a landslide and we get so so many good people in office we just continue to turn this tide but man
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:54.680]  we i mean those those that's high hopes right there that's playing it real close to the chest

[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:29.480]  more it's even in the associated press so now they're beginning to understand that we the people
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:35.240]  know that there is a corporate global government and the beast top tech billionaires sit in meetings
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:41.400]  and decide to pull the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're witnessing so remember
[1:14:41.400 --> 1:14:47.800]  that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:53.880]  for the collapse of civilization they are the enemies of humanity they want you dead
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:15:00.440]  you're listening to the alex joneshow
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:21.880]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:24.440]  your host owin treuer
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:34.120]  sitting in for alex jones he will be joining us shortly
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:44.120]  let me just put out the phone number if alex isn't back i'll take phone calls in the next segment
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:49.320]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:57.400]  two five three nine specifically regarding now attorney general bar who's not going to be moving
[1:15:57.400 --> 1:16:04.440]  he's not going to be doing his job to move against obama and biden and all the cohorts
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:14.600]  with their treasonous plot their coup attempt you know i'm sitting here just analyzing all of it
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:24.440]  and it's such a dynamic quagmire that we have to get ourselves out of and it's like
[1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:29.800]  if you make the wrong twist or contortion of your body
[1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:36.520]  then the rope that's got your leg tangled up will get worse but maybe you freed your right arm
[1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:40.920]  but now you got a twist to get that one off your left leg and then oh you just got your
[1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:45.400]  caught in in this thing on your right leg now it's like how do you contort and twist to get out of
[1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:50.200]  this without having something else grab you and keep you in in in bondage
[1:16:53.080 --> 1:17:00.520]  and so we're seeing right now the deep state globalists are running every single play in their
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:08.280]  playbook pretty much in 2020 they've they've run just about everything i mean until the aliens come
[1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:12.520]  down from the sky they've ran just about every play they've got in the book
[1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:21.880]  and we still got 24 days to the election so hey a little gray alien may come climbing down a
[1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:28.040]  mountain soon and and say i'm advanced alien from the future vote biden and you know
[1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:33.320]  yeah aliens for biden martians for biden
[1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:37.960]  or maybe they'll say i'm here to destroy you and we love trump
[1:17:39.640 --> 1:17:41.240]  trump wants to destroy you he's one of us
[1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:45.320]  they're fake pandemic
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:49.720]  they're staging a false flags
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:56.680]  all the different things they've done to try to get trump out of the office
[1:17:56.680 --> 1:18:04.200]  and then they get caught that see this is the good news everybody knows that they were going to come
[1:18:04.200 --> 1:18:08.520]  out today with nancy pelosi and make the 25th amendment to get trump out of the white house
[1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:11.480]  and everybody saw it coming
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:17.240]  because that's one of those things that it's like usually only info wars is ahead of that curve
[1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:23.160]  everybody saw this one coming and so they had to do a bait and switch and say oh well
[1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:28.440]  we're just doing this for future presidents and so now the story is they're gonna remove biden
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:35.960]  think about that the democrats have already shown you their hand to get biden out of office
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:42.040]  he hasn't even won yet and they're already getting ready to remove him from office
[1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:44.920]  these people have gone mad with power
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:54.840]  and it appears now bill bar may be covering for them
[1:19:04.120 --> 1:19:09.640]  i don't know folks when you've got all of this corruption
[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:18.920]  and so many people going with the management plan of well just wait it out just wait it out
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:24.360]  vote get these people out of office and then in time we can clear this up no here's the problem
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  this is a vicious rabid attack dog that will never stop coming for you
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:37.160]  you may be able to distract it with a bone
[1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:42.120]  for a minute but it's as soon as finished with that bone it's coming for you
[1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:46.840]  you can put it in the cage but it's going to get out of that cage
[1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:50.440]  no you have to put it down yet got put down
[1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:58.680]  and so the only thing i can think if there's actually
[1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:07.240]  people that are trying to fix the country right now is they hope that they we can do this politically
[1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:12.520]  with elections and that they don't have to arrest arrest anybody or indict any of their friends
[1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:17.000]  or actually do anything about the treason that just happened under the obama administration
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:29.320]  but it's really just a joke level at this point when call written house and the mcloskey's
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:31.640]  are facing
[1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:43.800]  the worst of punishments for for for non non-aggression principle mcloskey's didn't do anything violent
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:47.240]  call written house was attacked viciously and he had to protect his life
[1:20:49.640 --> 1:20:54.520]  and they're the bad guys but if you're antifa if you're blm if you go out in the street mobs
[1:20:55.160 --> 1:21:02.760]  and murder and loot and destroy nothing happens to you it's a two ruled two
[1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:09.080]  tiered justice system from the bottom to the top if you're a democrat you can commit treason
[1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:14.040]  and nothing happens if you're trump and you call the president of ukraine they to congratulate him
[1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:17.000]  for winning an election you committed treason and you must be removed from office
[1:21:24.520 --> 1:21:30.840]  if you're a democrat and you commit heinous crimes the media will cover for you if you're a republican
[1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:41.800]  and you walk jaywalk well you're you're the worst person ever you're a conservative you're standing
[1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:48.440]  outside of a pro-life rally or you're standing outside of a abortion clinic during covid and
[1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:53.480]  and you have a sign or you're riding on the sidewalk no more abortion my body my choice
[1:21:53.480 --> 1:22:01.480]  no masks you get arrested you go to jail but if you're antifa and you just burn down 10 buildings
[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:09.560]  cause two billion dollars of destruction or blm just just rob the liquor store rob the gas station
[1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:26.280]  rob the target nothing zero zilch nada it's about as bad as it gets folks and the only thing that
[1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:30.360]  gets worse from here is they literally start coming after you to put you in internment camps
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:36.360]  which they're already announcing they're going to do in canada for covid a fake pandemic
[1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:42.040]  and then you see all the celebrities that are totally sold out
[1:22:44.360 --> 1:22:47.080]  and it's just the most pathetic thing you've ever seen in your life
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:55.400]  so when we get back from this break that we're about to take in 60 seconds alex jones is going
[1:22:55.400 --> 1:22:59.880]  to be back in studio maybe maybe i'll stick around here if he wants me and we can get into this but
[1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:07.320]  uh yep bill bar has uh let the biden campaign know don't worry i got you i got your back
[1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:13.880]  you're going to be able to run clean and uh and if you win then you'll be fine you'll you'll get
[1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:18.440]  away with all the treason so will obama and rison all of them and that's their plan folks
[1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:25.320]  that's their plan so uh we're facing a real bad situation with bar and haspel and ray all sold
[1:23:25.320 --> 1:23:28.760]  out for trump and all trump is trying to do is save this country i mean all he's trying to do is
[1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:34.200]  save the world really from this creeping communism that he knows will be total destruction so

[1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:09.800]  recap for a couple minutes why you're upset and what bill bar has done saying that there's not
[1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:18.120]  going to be any october surprise uh or november first surprise concerning the deep state spying on
[1:31:19.080 --> 1:31:24.040]  president trump's campaign and president elect and the president uh or the ongoing espionage
[1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:29.160]  go ahead and speak to that well it's it's that's kind of the cherry on top i mean at the at the
[1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:33.800]  base of it you have all the left-wing terrorism that they get away with but if you're a church or a
[1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:38.840]  pro-life group you get arrested or a salon owner you get arrested you go to jail it's the
[1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:45.240]  the shutting down of the economy it's it's all this stuff and then it's like okay well you know what
[1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:50.760]  now they tell us that well we've shown you all the documents obama spied hillary ran the whole
[1:31:50.760 --> 1:31:55.640]  russian hoax and it was total treasonous coup plot against the president but uh we're gonna wait
[1:31:55.640 --> 1:31:58.920]  because we don't want to be political about it we'll we'll maybe released after the election
[1:31:58.920 --> 1:32:03.240]  which to me just says they're never going to release and that's like saying obama had a five
[1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:07.080]  year old boy tied up in his basement we're not going to say the little boy because it would
[1:32:07.080 --> 1:32:14.440]  make the democrats look bad but but this is the system they set up and because comey wanted to be
[1:32:14.440 --> 1:32:19.240]  back in the white house he released some of the hillary stuff on the eve of the election uh just
[1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:23.240]  because he's a political operator and thought that trump could be compromised that didn't happen so
[1:32:23.240 --> 1:32:28.200]  then they have egg on their face but let's just pull back from this we know bill bar was high
[1:32:28.200 --> 1:32:35.400]  level cia we know bill bar was brought in by h w bush in the early 1990s uh right before the clinton's
[1:32:35.400 --> 1:32:41.960]  we know who these people are and so he represents the older establishment that doesn't want to
[1:32:41.960 --> 1:32:47.720]  completely destroy america but wants to carry out globalism that we kind of control then the newer
[1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:53.080]  globalists are run by communist china they're the latter phase of it for the takedown of america
[1:32:53.080 --> 1:32:57.720]  so now the dialectic is on the right you've got globalists that just don't want to destroy america
[1:32:57.720 --> 1:33:02.520]  they want to have a seat at the new world order and then you've got the uh hyperglobalist that
[1:33:02.520 --> 1:33:06.920]  want all nation states totally destroyed so we have a paradigm of that false debate right there
[1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:13.800]  and bar represents those that want to slowly salami slice america up a little pieces and and
[1:33:13.800 --> 1:33:19.480]  digest it with enjoyment instead of a big messy burn it all down at once because he understands
[1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:25.320]  that he'll probably get put in a gulag during that process this sees as well so anybody that
[1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:29.880]  you know lion eyes is bar anybody that thinks it's all magically going to get fixed i mean this just
[1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:34.600]  proves all the q-tard stuff is not accurate that doesn't mean people that like q or researching are
[1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:38.120]  bad they always come to me on the street and say did you hear about the child kidnapping rings or the
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:42.280]  fellow reserves private or the eugenics of the new world order i'm like yeah i knew a little bit
[1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:47.400]  about that they go thank you you got it from q and i go yes i i started my show with q uh 26 years
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:52.280]  ago i mean i'm glad that they're informed i'm glad they're getting involved but this is the babies
[1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:57.800]  waking up and this is kind of the esoteric path they like like a cereal box you know decoder ring
[1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:04.440]  or something i don't look down on them they just don't know how surrounded trump is how dangerous
[1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:09.000]  it is how many indictments the southern district has ready on his family how many indictments
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.880]  leticia james has i mean i know about these indictments okay i mean i talk to the folks that
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:19.800]  are involved in it okay i mean because i'm involved in it okay i'll just leave it at that so that's
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:25.400]  where all this is and and and i live in the real world and i want to assess that we're waking up the
[1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:30.760]  world's coming back to its senses we've launched a major populist offensive and the globalists want
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:36.760]  to shut it down the un came out and won a Nobel peace prize today for stopping food being used as
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:42.520]  a weapon the covid lockdown causes the food shortages is killing millions that's food as a weapon
[1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:48.920]  and they said oh the populist and nation states are causing the starvation so this is a global
[1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:54.760]  government un drill to lock down the world economy to destroy local economies to destroy local businesses
[1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:59.320]  and farmers to consolidate power with the big mega tech titans who've all gotten you know almost
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:07.400]  doubled their wealth all of them and then they literally in the nobel prize say you are stopping
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:12.680]  hunger and using food as a weapon and you're crushing populist and the nations it actually says it i
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:17.080]  read at the start of the show i'll go back over again so just think of the magnitude of that oh and
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:23.880]  we're now out in the open facing a world government that's giving awards to itself for exterminating
[1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:31.160]  people as a sick joke well and that's what's so frustrating alex is that there is no more gray area
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:37.160]  in this there is no more uh you know secret you don't need a secret decoder like it's all out we've
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:41.160]  seen it all i mean just but but but babies babies can't deal with something straight up that they
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:45.720]  need a little piece of it and then they've got magic and excessive terror they're in the club and
[1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:49.960]  now know exactly world governments out in the open and then they're all waiting oh everyone's
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:54.120]  secretly been arrested hillary's been in jail three years everything's fine oh bar you know
[1:35:54.120 --> 1:35:59.320]  they're gonna get them all oh durham you already told you durams in dining well couple low level
[1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:04.680]  fbi agents that falsified reports that's it because they're covering their own asses because
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:09.640]  trump hasn't gotten full control of the executive branch of the bureaucracy he hasn't gotten that
[1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:15.000]  done yet because the bureaucracy is strong and elastic and and and like a blob but here's the
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:21.560]  good news with every waking day more people don't trust mainstream media more people are awake and
[1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:25.160]  the covet thing was the globalist desperate action to get us back out of the control and
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:29.560]  it's backfired magnificently against gates and all of it let's let's walk through that on when we
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:33.480]  come back because look for people in the front line like all you great listeners and supporters
[1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:38.360]  and oh and it's frustrating me too i'm i'm worse than he is about getting upset but we knew all
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:44.120]  this was coming my i mean my gosh uh i mean this is this is where we are but we've come back from
[1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:49.160]  so far behind like 200 points behind now we're like 15 points behind we're winning folks
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:57.720]  the bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:04.360]  who give their power unto the one world leader the antichrist and he has a beast system that no
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:09.560]  one can find or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we
[1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:16.040]  look back on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:23.160]  god or prophecy giving governments corporations the power to control who can buy it who can sell
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:28.680]  to track everything we do he's not just a recipe it's a blueprint for a total enslave but now you
[1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:34.280]  look at bill gates you look at bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we should
[1:37:34.280 --> 1:37:39.800]  decide how much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're technocrats
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:44.520]  we know best we're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you you
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:50.280]  snap your fingers we're here they're just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying with it
[1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:57.000]  it's insane there has never in my 20s and years on air been a more critical or important time to
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:02.440]  be self-sufficient and listen i don't sell firearms i don't sell ammunition that is one of the most
[1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:07.240]  important things you can have along with a good relationship with god during times like this
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:12.760]  but what i can't help you with is high-quality storable food high-quality water filtration
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:18.280]  all at one place now you always get the very best deals from my patreon nm4store.com we are
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:23.000]  their biggest distributor but because of how crazy things are they have agreed to give us a deal no
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.880]  one else has been able to get so this is the lowest price on the lowest price highest quality
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:35.080]  storable food you're going to find at preparewithalix.com now they've set it out just three days
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:40.280]  this upcoming monday we're only 27 days out from the election and it's about a week or so they'll
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:45.080]  be able to ship it to you they've got the food on hand but they cannot guarantee this one week ship
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:50.360]  rate in the next month or so things are so crazy and food prices are going up so take action now
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:59.160]  and perhaps most cruelly of all if donald trump has his way the complications from
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:08.760]  covid-19 which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that 200 million people have died
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:16.920]  200 million people have died probably by the time i finish this talk right after joe biden made that
[1:39:16.920 --> 1:39:23.080]  statement that more than 60 of america has died from covid-19 when it's not even 200 000 reality
[1:39:23.080 --> 1:39:28.200]  he would want to say six million have lung scarring and heart damage it's all made up but you know
[1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:31.960]  where you got it the mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that
[1:39:31.960 --> 1:39:38.760]  they said that four percent of america would be dead already of course it's point zero zero zero
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:44.840]  zero and then add a number because the numbers vary it's a real virus just like people being
[1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:50.520]  struck by lightning is real but to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria
[1:39:50.520 --> 1:39:58.200]  and is mind control the future isn't coming it's here and in the future keeping your humanity
[1:39:58.760 --> 1:40:05.400]  saving your soul your integrity your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset in fact
[1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:12.520]  it's going to be your only asset the world being built by the technocrats the trap they've now sprung
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:18.600]  is covid-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past
[1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:27.240]  investigation into total and complete dehumanization human life will be impossible to be carried out
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:35.320]  in an original biological way by the year 2050 this is their stated goal i'm sorry to have to
[1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:41.240]  report horrifying things like this to you but only by facing the horror and not projecting
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:47.080]  your own decency onto the enemy we turn this around you must study their own writings you must
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:51.880]  face the facts and you must come to grips with it you're all being incrementally destroyed
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:41:07.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:17.800]  cut to the chase
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:33.160]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones so let's go ahead and cut to the chase
[1:41:33.160 --> 1:41:42.120]  here the banking cartels the control big tech the control communist china the new world order the
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:46.840]  davos group the bilgerberg group the state and globalist the technocrats michael bloomberg
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:58.840]  jeff bezos tim cook zuckerberg bill gates are on record i mean there was an article out in bloom
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:05.960]  burg a couple years ago with bloomberg it was like the king technocrat and he said i will decide what
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:13.160]  you eat where you live and what job you have i know best he's a megalomaniac saying an article
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:20.680]  about him like bloomberg meet the top ruling technocrat i think that's the headline and you
[1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:26.120]  read it it's like a joke but they're writing it for the narcissist lunatic and you look at bezos
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:32.120]  there it is bloomberg knows best by the media tycoon could be the democrat's best shot at victory oh
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:36.360]  no that's another one that's the times of London no no you need to find the one type in bloomberg
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:43.720]  technocrat click web bloomberg technocrat click web and it and it's all about he's god and he knows
[1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:49.480]  and then what does bill gates say oh hi i'm your doctor i'm gonna put hundreds of vaccines in you
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:54.440]  a year that go in and rechange your actual dna and make everybody sick and die too and i've been
[1:42:54.440 --> 1:43:00.120]  killing people with vaccines but i'm just gonna do it so so here's the deal guys we can hope bill
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:03.960]  bar is gonna say was we can hope Donald Trump to say was you're gonna have to stop complying
[1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:09.560]  because when you comply with a mask you're saying yes to contact tracers and yes to the
[1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:15.320]  overblown uh scan that's covered 19 and yes to the force inoculations the whole agenda as we
[1:43:15.320 --> 1:43:21.400]  told you eight months ago and i know you know that but it doesn't get better now all that liberty we
[1:43:21.400 --> 1:43:28.840]  had the gas tank ran out now it's tyranny time t time big t time and the tyrants t for tyranny
[1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:35.400]  tyrannous are making their move right now and it's full court press and it doesn't stop till they're
[1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:41.560]  removed it's actually quite easy to beat them though bill gates ted turner wants to kill everybody
[1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:46.440]  too he's on record prints fill up they all say i want to world government kill everybody they
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:50.760]  don't like big cities they don't like you being around they don't like you having resources
[1:43:50.760 --> 1:43:57.080]  they're miserable trash and so instead of going oh jones is dystopic man that guy's got a bad attitude
[1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:02.040]  about life no i'm a realist i actually love my life i enjoy everything i enjoy fighting i enjoy
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:07.800]  eating food i enjoy working hard i enjoy hiking i enjoy my family i i i'm just sure being real i
[1:44:07.800 --> 1:44:11.800]  mean these powerful globalists have an agenda we've been right about the agenda no one else
[1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:19.400]  had the courage to lay it out hardcore like it is and this is it so i bet on you i believe in you
[1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:24.120]  i think you're gonna learn about this and get pissed those of you that are smarter
[1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:28.760]  are regular listeners not kissing your ass you're it you're the best there is you're the you're the
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:33.400]  globalist main enemy look in the mirror and they just hope you don't go convert other people to
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:37.320]  reality and i gotta show them the globalist own quotes show them the films we put out show the
[1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:41.480]  material and then they can see in front of them how the world works everything suddenly makes sense
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:47.480]  i can't tell you the retired generals and kernels and all sorts of people in corporate heads that go
[1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:52.120]  man jones nothing made sense till i read this or saw that or heard you talk about it and i
[1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:55.640]  went and looked it up and none of it's a lie you're telling the whole truth i mean dr rustle
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:45:01.560]  blalock was already super smart famous brain surgeon he heard my show 20 years ago went and
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:06.600]  researched it and got so freaked out by it he basically went off the radar and got ready for
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:12.840]  the total collapse like five years ago i mean and here's what i'm telling you info wars is not
[1:45:12.840 --> 1:45:17.720]  everything we're only the catalyst or like an enzyme that goes into this
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  sauce we're in goes into this storm goes into this environment goes into this climate and triggers
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:30.280]  you to do what you're already spring loaded to do and that's overcome tyrants not submit to them
[1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:36.520]  you don't evolve to submit that's de-evolution you evolve to overpower them and that's what
[1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:41.880]  you've got to do so this is by all intents and purposes an alien attack i don't see flying
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:46.520]  saucers i've never seen green man i don't get into that i'm saying what the globalist are building
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:51.640]  with clones and all this new gmo and all this nanotech they call it alien curse will goes oh i
[1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:55.000]  don't believe in aliens we're making them on the planet though i don't believe in god i'm gonna be
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:59.800]  god see how see how that works and so they're telling you to the media they got through fraud
[1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:04.360]  they bought up through fractals or banking that you're obsolete you suck and you're done stay in
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:09.240]  your house wear your little diaper mask go away don't do all this crap we're gonna protect you it's
[1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:16.040]  never gonna end because they think you're weak and they think they're not gonna get in trouble
[1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:19.880]  because they haven't gotten in trouble for 60 years of stuff they've done but that's what always
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:24.600]  happens to dictators and oligarchies but now when bill gates arrogantly comes up on tv and says
[1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:29.640]  you're gonna take five shots a year for just one vaccine and i'm gonna it's gonna hurt you
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:35.080]  but you're gonna do it starts giggling and gloating like a supervillain and then he wonders why everyone
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:40.440]  hates him so he hires more pr firms to say i'm not a supervillain and all it makes it is worse
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:45.720]  that's the enemy bleeding out in front of you you want to explain so so when i tell you how bad
[1:46:45.720 --> 1:46:51.080]  we were off 25 years ago nobody knew this we were way behind but i believed in you now we're
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:57.000]  surpassing the enemy and as long as we start non-compliant and as long as we start educating
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:02.920]  everyone everywhere we go grocery stores hiking bike trail i do it everywhere because i'm overcoming
[1:47:02.920 --> 1:47:09.320]  i'm on fire i don't get tired fighting i get stronger fighting i will not submit bill gates is
[1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:13.960]  not better than me and i will not have my gravestone and your gravestone pissed on by that damn piece
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:18.040]  of filth oh and you see what i'm saying now i absolutely see what you're saying it's just you
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:25.080]  know i mean how do we get enough people to wake up before the tyranny is entrenched and we can never
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:29.720]  get out of it we're listen we're gonna get i understand and we've got to keep people if they
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:34.840]  realize that they're more important than we are quite frankly we've already detonated with their
[1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:41.160]  support the the the wavelength it's already going it's already going out and if they supercharge
[1:47:41.160 --> 1:47:46.280]  what we say what we do and add their own research to it it will vaporize the enemy yeah that's why
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:50.920]  they finally banned q some people i know launched you because they didn't want to get sued for
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:55.000]  saying real stuff that was going on it got hijacked by the enemy the president wanted it dropped
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:58.440]  then it grew so well people said hey it's actually positive now you notice i came out
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:04.920]  endorse it right before the president did and then now it's but that's just an idea so so the way q
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:09.400]  has been to vaporize the enemy is another example this can't be stopped brother well when people
[1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:12.920]  learn they're going bankrupt and people learn they're dying of cancer because of the bill gates
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:17.640]  what's gonna happen to him you think people you think the wave we're in right now has been big
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:24.440]  brother the wave coming is gonna be 50 times bigger we're gonna be sitting back in 10 years 20
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:27.960]  years looking we're still alive looking back and feeling sorry for the new world order i mean

[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:58.440]  i you know we we have to go through bull crap and obama still gets to buy luxurious mansions
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:01.880]  after he commits treason that's all it is it just you know it's just a depressing thing

[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:11.080]  win in a landslide this is all great stuff it's just like it's just depressing how pathetic it gets
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:17.160]  when you have people walking outside in masks and you know it's all bull crap and then bill bar can't
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:21.400]  even go after people and do his job when you know it's barred i'm not even defending bar but he did
[1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:26.360]  say this is the greatest slavery since slavery yeah all right all right we're gonna go to break come

[1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:39.480]  special corrupt technician teams internationally for George Herbert walker bush look at it more
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:46.120]  as a defection to us that he's more and more like 80 working against him i mean these these

[1:54:01.560 --> 1:54:07.000]  all right oh and i want to get into how you and i were playing for being behind the governor wittmer
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:11.400]  attempted kidnapping by any book which none of the media will cover but on their own site they're
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:19.720]  commander um looks just like you i'm joking uh says he hates trump hates capitalism hates america
[1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:23.640]  hates all this stuff because the really trendy communists always call themselves
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:29.400]  anarchists and none of it makes any sense but but let's just get back to bill bar you knew durham
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:36.120]  who's been on this case almost three years is doing nothing and think of it as they're not
[1:54:36.120 --> 1:54:40.680]  going to push the deep state too hard so they don't push a coup against trump too hard i think it's a
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:45.720]  miscalculation i think it shows weakness i think it'll only intensify them trying to get the un
[1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:50.280]  involved openly in our election or removing the president which they're in the news saying new
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:58.520]  york times un states the seat un certifies our leader this is treason i agree that that that
[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:02.520]  trump needs to go all out and just arrest these people but they'll go oh that's political you're
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:06.840]  a dictator no they're the ones trying to be dictators so just because someone commits a crime
[1:55:07.960 --> 1:55:11.000]  in the threat continuum you've got to raise it to that point
[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:17.960]  i just i mean i just see what everyone else sees and it's just frustrating i mean i i'm not i'm not
[1:55:17.960 --> 1:55:22.920]  sitting here claiming that bill bar is the end of america i'm just simply saying this sucks you
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:27.560]  know i thought bill bar was gonna hit a home run but we've we've known i mean listen i told you
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:34.040]  they're not gonna indict all these people okay do you believe okay q lord said hell it's i'm not
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:38.040]  saying i'm not saying anything i'm saying there's no justice here that's all i'm saying uh yeah
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:43.640]  they never executed napoleon he killed millions of people because he was a king he was an emperor
[1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:50.840]  they put him on a damn island that's what these elites do they don't ever get in trouble i know
[1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:55.800]  i'm sick of it i'm damn sick of it but you know trump uh you know cough so he just is a super
[1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:59.880]  spreader now you know he's the or you know ban conservatives because they think there's only
[1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:03.800]  two genders yeah well it's time for us to stop i agree the discrimination the bullying this is
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:08.440]  wrong speaking of that what do you think of the daily beast us saying that the only people the
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:13.160]  leader loved was us meanwhile we love trump he says f trump it let's go ahead and play a clip
[1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:18.360]  of the commander of the antifa militia that they now say uh is under trump's command here it is
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:26.600]  no trump is not your friend dude dude and it's it's amazes me that people actually
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:31.720]  how'd you shave your head that when he's shown over and over and over again i've got five
[1:56:31.720 --> 1:56:39.400]  points i'm tiring every single person that works for government is your enemy dude what does that
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:43.720]  even mean but but then obviously once they collapse the government they'll bring in something 10 times
[1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:49.720]  worse so they had i think it was 14 guys that they were able to get set up in this deal and it looks
[1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:56.200]  like an fbi set up sting operation um and i think you know maybe so think they think it looks like
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:57:00.680]  it well you know you got to be careful what you say these days they'll come they'll come raid this
[1:57:00.680 --> 1:57:06.120]  place in in a minute if we say the wrong thing so hopefully better not then uh there was there
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:11.880]  there was 14 of these guys and i think everybody kind of sees what's going on you go uh you know
[1:57:11.880 --> 1:57:16.440]  find some guys on the internet or whatever that are pissed off about whatever political thing and
[1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:21.720]  then you you look at their commander right and of course they're saying that these are all trump
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:27.160]  supporters there was there was one person that in there that had any in these 14 individuals that
[1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:32.120]  had any um evidence that he had any you mean the media is lying again no they had this ready for
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:36.760]  months whitmer's in trouble with the supreme court saying she's a tyrant and that's why they did this
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:44.360]  this absolutely and you know it was funny too because it's like look no but nobody's calling
[1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:48.360]  to kidnap bretchen whitmer we're saying hey look she's the one that sent coveted infested she's
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:52.360]  kidnapping everyone she puts us under lockdown exactly which is a form of kidnapping let me tell
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:56.600]  you coming up next look at this right here oh i said the name on there it's not family

[1:58:19.160 --> 1:58:25.960]  up and he actually discovered this this this creature this general gender neutral creature

[1:58:31.480 --> 1:58:39.560]  war room and uh he thought bill bar was going to save us he might still save us maybe he's no

[1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:54.280]  his right i never was right in the door for more than a hundred years the rockefeller foundation
[1:58:54.280 --> 1:58:59.800]  has worked to establish world government abolish nation states dumb down the population by taking
[1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:05.960]  control of education and most importantly taking control of western medicine now they had a bad name
[1:59:05.960 --> 1:59:11.480]  by the 1920s they started converting over and funding other organizations and groups like
[1:59:11.480 --> 1:59:18.920]  ibm to continue on with their eugenics operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed
[1:59:18.920 --> 1:59:24.760]  by ibm via his mother on the board of directors to bill gates the third his father of course being
[1:59:24.760 --> 1:59:30.920]  had a planned parenthood and now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department
[1:59:30.920 --> 1:59:38.600]  in the world every national health system bill gates is in control they have spent 100 plus years
[1:59:38.600 --> 1:59:44.040]  getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body
[1:59:44.040 --> 1:59:49.800]  this is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of dna
[1:59:49.800 --> 2:00:05.720]  in your body you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow
[2:00:11.080 --> 2:00:13.880]  there must be some kind of way out of here
[2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:24.120]  yeah there's too much confusion all right folks you've got to have a little bit of release
[2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:31.800]  the type of crazy stuff that's going on here so coal her is a very popular guy i probably had
[2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:35.800]  50 people the last month tell me about him i guess he seems to have worked before but never
[2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:40.040]  kind of you know placed it with him when i saw the new video i told him more research he's a comedian
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:48.040]  activist and mascot and salesman he is co-host of a popular comedy podcast podcast but outside
[2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:53.560]  in recent news call an instagram star received a zoom link from a student for a discussion
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:59.480]  about a potential mascot he took the opportunity to mock the university uh decision by introducing
[2:00:59.480 --> 2:01:06.760]  his own let's just say women have breasts they have something else it's called tp but the point
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:11.080]  is is that they actually took it very very serious we're going to play that for you here in a minute
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:15.960]  we're on radio stations so we don't violate any of the FCC's rules even though democrats can cuss

[2:01:43.800 --> 2:01:49.000]  that's the friend family friendly version of the uh mascot proposal from our guest uh coal here
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:55.480]  but very woke but but it's not the name it's the creature this maybe we should roll some b-roll
[2:01:55.480 --> 2:02:00.200]  can you imagine that thing skating around a football field or a basketball court that's actually
[2:02:00.200 --> 2:02:05.320]  the left should get mascots like this because it looks like them literally yeah there's some
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:10.280]  examples so uh joining us you got a lot of exploits is coal hersh coal thanks for coming on today my
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:18.360]  friend hello hi mr jones how are you good good so so tell us how you got into these exploits and
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:22.840]  then we're gonna play the video of the creature you've created that well tell us about the university
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:29.560]  too that that i'm told it's in the running now actually to adopt this as a new mascot uh yes
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:35.160]  saddleback college uh i have yet to hear back from them whether they'll they've accepted my
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:41.400]  pitch or not but i am i since i have not heard from them i am selling um tp merchandise uh to
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:50.280]  prove to saddleback that uh people are in support of this mascot well tell us how you dreamed up this
[2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:58.360]  this this incredible creature oh well they just needed a uh their mascot was racist their current
[2:02:58.360 --> 2:03:03.240]  one and they needed some alternative pitches so i thought i'd give them something that everyone
[2:03:03.240 --> 2:03:10.600]  could get on board with like i liked it this the green gray skin you know that's neutral so i don't
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:16.920]  think that offends anybody you know that was a very woke thing for you to do thank you yeah uh tp is
[2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:23.480]  pretty woke uh in all tell us about this university and who and who who that uh this this goblin creature
[2:03:23.480 --> 2:03:34.200]  is replacing uh so the goblin creature will be replacing um the gaucho um i'm not sure why he's
[2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:40.120]  a racist mascot i just read somewhere that he is and it infuriated me so so he's a Mexican cowboy
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:46.120]  he's a man uh he's he's he's whipping the horse he looks aggressive he's not good yeah i'm i'm
[2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:50.920]  starting to feel a little anger over this mascot too the racism portrayed in this mascot is really
[2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:55.080]  starting to anger me too cool well actually the new mascot looks like michelle obama so in
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:02.840]  the new mascot does it is the new mascot a fan of big mic
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:13.080]  is tp a fan of big mic yes uh tp is a fan of everybody yeah i would imagine someone so woke
[2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:16.520]  would be all right so so let's talk about the university the clip we're about to see tell us
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:24.600]  about this so i don't attend this university but one of my followers sent me the link uh i
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:31.000]  actually was not sure i didn't know that university existed um but i knew i had to stand up for what's
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:37.240]  right so i joined the i joined the zoom and again this is a zoom for what university
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:42.200]  saddleback college and this is the act that this is the leadership of the college
[2:04:42.200 --> 2:04:48.920]  yes it's the it's a mix of faculty and students all right so here they are discussing the racist
[2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:53.320]  mascot he proposes the new mascot uh let's go ahead and roll that video
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:05:02.440]  right thank you so much camera and let's now welcome col hersh hi how are you um i have a
[2:05:02.440 --> 2:05:09.480]  little i wrote a little pitch if i could read through that please dear saddleback college
[2:05:09.480 --> 2:05:15.480]  let's face it our mascot the gaucho is racist and it's time for him to be murdered anyway i have
[2:05:15.480 --> 2:05:21.800]  just the idea for a new progressive mascot for your school her name is and she's a woke sloppy
[2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:26.520]  goblin girl who rides around the campus on sweat stained roller skates and begs each student to come
[2:05:26.520 --> 2:05:32.440]  out as bi if a student refuses to do so she will let out a streak that has the frequency to change
[2:05:32.440 --> 2:05:38.280]  the student's body hair to strawberry blonde then she will say tough breaks straightie have fun
[2:05:38.280 --> 2:05:43.560]  sticking out like a sore thumb to do ever visit the beach in palestine at sporting events instead
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:49.160]  of displaying kiss cans on the jumbotron she will instead screen promos for her only fans which
[2:05:49.160 --> 2:05:54.680]  mainly consists of her getting off to the school flat during halftime she will do her signature
[2:05:54.680 --> 2:06:00.040]  dance move the pop lock and swap it whereas we'll make the team swap mouth guards to reassure the
[2:06:00.040 --> 2:06:04.920]  fans that none of the players are homophobic if either team refuses she'll take a knee for the
[2:06:04.920 --> 2:06:11.080]  rest of the game right in the middle of the field so thank you for your time and i hope you can
[2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:22.280]  consider all right thank you call let's go ahead and welcome clloe johnson so they just all play
[2:06:22.280 --> 2:06:28.520]  along with it but that's how absurdist all of this is on you know these zoom meetings are so
[2:06:28.520 --> 2:06:33.400]  ridiculous too because it makes it so easy to get in and then control but it also kind of gives
[2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:38.200]  them control of it too uh because they can kind of mute you and that's a big text revolution to
[2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:42.520]  put us on a little postage stamp but see that's the thing like if you if you got into one of these
[2:06:42.520 --> 2:06:46.840]  zoom calls and you were like hi yeah you know i think president trump is doing a great job
[2:06:46.840 --> 2:06:51.480]  you know they'll cut you off but if you're like hey look at this new mascot um you know tie-dye
[2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:56.520]  punta i think it's time to hang trumpet by his toenails and dropping acid a call her what are

[2:08:13.800 --> 2:08:18.280]  school shooting on the day that they happen they'll approach anyone who's crying or dead and hand

[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:56.120]  talks about there being ten kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:11:02.200]  power unto the one world leader the anti christ and that he has a beast system that no one could
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:07.320]  buy and or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we look
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:13.560]  back on all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:20.680]  god or prophecy giving governments corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell
[2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:26.040]  to track everything we do he's not just a recipe it's a blueprint for a total enslavement and now
[2:11:26.040 --> 2:11:31.800]  you look at bill gates you look at bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we should
[2:11:31.800 --> 2:11:37.240]  decide how much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're technocrats
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:41.400]  we know best and we're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control
[2:11:41.400 --> 2:11:47.400]  you you snap your fingers we're here they're just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:12:03.320]  with it it's insane you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:03.320 --> 2:12:21.640]  all right get on a segment here and i'm gonna get into the latest news developments
[2:12:21.640 --> 2:12:27.960]  ever col harsh leaves us col getting serious though your political awakening really where you see
[2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:32.440]  the world and the way you're fighting back with memes and art and reaching tens of millions of
[2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:40.120]  people because looking at the creature you've created tp we should be able to say this it's
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:44.360]  so politically correct that they teach conservatives we can't have language then everybody else can
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:50.680]  have languages like the grand t-tons means the grand in french titties uh but we were not supposed
[2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:56.120]  to say it it's titty pussy it's titty pussy it's titty pussy titty pussy anyways we're done but
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:12:59.320]  i'm telling you they the left goes and follows complaints on our radio stations when we say
[2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:04.680]  everything they say so there you go but i need to create the boyfriend of this something like
[2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:10.200]  goblin slob or like this let me just tell you this actually looks like hillary were you channeling
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:14.440]  hillary was this like a young hillary is this is this hillary spirit animal col harsh
[2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:25.160]  this is just a uh it's a goblin girl there's really nothing beyond that it's just a goblin girl
[2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:31.640]  though i show hillary with an evil smile hillary evil smile then fade it i'm telling you this is
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:40.360]  her spirit animal no the boyfriend needs to be really skinny emasculated you know like just a
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:45.080]  total soy boy but be a pedophile have the look i don't know if you can real how you would portray
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:51.480]  that was his name will be baby baby raper okay that's very liberating baby yeah baby raper is the
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:57.560]  name of uh tp mm boyfriend that's uh it's one direction you could go well means the less all
[2:13:57.560 --> 2:14:03.560]  about killing babies they have a whole action figures like baby killer yeah okay baby brain
[2:14:03.560 --> 2:14:09.480]  damage her yeah yeah so but it's maybe this this soy boy is so woke oh boy you know what we're going
[2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:16.600]  into dark places i don't even uh but uh i think uh tp's uh boyfriend just needs to be a total soy
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:23.000]  boy maybe likes to hang around uh you know grade schools during recess oh my gosh we can have a
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:31.720]  merman edition that's a pretty striking resemblance to me yeah that's a question does does tp look more
[2:14:31.720 --> 2:14:37.560]  like big mic or yes or guess that you know actually we don't we don't even know if tp is a boy or a
[2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:42.520]  girl okay let's let tp let's let tp's creator talk col what do you want to say about this creation
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:50.840]  uh i think this creation is i mean if you have anything against it you're i don't know basically
[2:14:50.840 --> 2:14:57.320]  cancelled um but i also do want to say that you know i didn't i didn't intend to satirize the left
[2:14:57.320 --> 2:15:03.080]  or the liberals i thought this was just a genuinely good idea i thought they're the mascot is racist
[2:15:03.080 --> 2:15:11.640]  um not my mascot the the gout show uh but yeah really all all i have left to say is that i do have
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:20.600]  i am selling a tp merchandise um at at bonfire.com slash store slash titty pussy sorry i said the
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:27.160]  word i know you might get fined for that but no we're gonna lay that out well sir all i can tell
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:35.480]  you is is it as tp's father are you proud of your creature i am i feel like she's she's breathed new
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:43.640]  life into into the whole new the whole new culture of it's kind of like katlyn jenner too yeah and
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:50.360]  you know i'm a little confused now col you know it you keep saying her i mean has has has tp actually
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:55.960]  identified the pronouns yeah you're not you're not misgendering yeah i mean i i want to be sure here
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:16:04.840]  um no she is her she is she she identifies as she what is what is what is tp doing on its off
[2:16:04.840 --> 2:16:11.320]  time what what is it what is on the roller skates what does it do uh she's just trying to have people
[2:16:11.320 --> 2:16:18.360]  have a sexual awakening um which means you know she's trying to she's trying to make everyone
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:25.880]  have their first reason so she's a guardian a guide that teaches us how to be sexual
[2:16:27.240 --> 2:16:33.960]  mm-hmm you can't claim it's racist she doesn't have piercing eyes oh yeah i was gonna say
[2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:38.760]  we're on the cuck slayer on the other hand he wants every he needs everybody to be straight
[2:16:40.040 --> 2:16:45.720]  hmm equal opportunity honestly cuck slayer knows that once somebody starts pushing
[2:16:45.720 --> 2:16:50.120]  sex stuff on kids it's it's bad period well if that's what i'm afraid of if if you put
[2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:55.160]  cuckslayer and tp or goblin schlorb in the same room i think only cuckslayers getting out of
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:16:59.960]  their lives it's not going to be good i mean he's got guns his arms and legs you know that's not good
[2:16:59.960 --> 2:17:05.960]  for uh tp so i believe we're misgendering i mean i think tp could be a man too i mean i i don't want
[2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:10.600]  to i want to hair under the arm yeah and i feel like i'm judging just because somebody wears a well
[2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:17.240]  tp also has a dress and a skirt large genital beard just because just because someone wears a dress
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:22.520]  and a skirt and has a long pigtail hair doesn't mean that you know you can't assume somebody's
[2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:28.760]  gender like that so you know i think that maybe saddleback is on the fence with tp right now because
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:34.520]  it's a it's a woman maybe if tp was gender neutral it might actually be adopted as the mascot have
[2:17:34.520 --> 2:17:43.160]  ever thought about that no but now i am thinking about it now i'm thinking about it and should be
[2:17:43.160 --> 2:17:48.840]  you know tb tbd i mean all i really want to know you know i'm still waiting to hear back from saddle
[2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:56.440]  back but you guys tbd you guys do accept cuckslayer as your new mascot we're gonna have to deliberate
[2:17:56.440 --> 2:18:07.160]  over that i need to make sure you're woke enough with tpd first that's actually pretty good i mean

[2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:53.080]  front door it was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your
[2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:59.240]  gps location i read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was
[2:22:59.240 --> 2:23:05.400]  on american now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on apple and
[2:23:05.400 --> 2:23:11.560]  on droids don't just track your location but your surfing history where you go who you talk to
[2:23:11.560 --> 2:23:16.760]  your relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:23.480]  as well including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like siri or alexa do
[2:23:23.480 --> 2:23:29.800]  and then putting databases transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever
[2:23:29.800 --> 2:23:33.880]  your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:38.200]  based on information this is the global chinese communist social credit score
[2:23:38.200 --> 2:23:43.960]  get your protection privacy pockets at info war store dot com and cut big brother off dead in his
[2:23:43.960 --> 2:23:53.720]  filthy tracks info or store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:12.600]  it has been said that with great power comes great responsibility but as long as we do things
[2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:20.520]  best we can in an attempt to help others and we ask god spirit into us the lord knows that we are
[2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:27.640]  fallible creatures and will forgive us but if you notice on the left they all claim they were the
[2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:32.440]  party animals they were cool they were no judgment they were hey enjoy yourself they were undermining
[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:37.080]  society but now that they're in charge they're like you don't leave your house and as we say
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:41.640]  you wear a mask we control your kids we're going to put things to you that make you sick we're going
[2:24:41.640 --> 2:24:44.520]  to annihilate your language we're going to tell you what you can watch and do
[2:24:48.840 --> 2:24:53.640]  what they are as the authoritarians and so i just think as long as we challenge them
[2:24:53.640 --> 2:24:57.720]  and speak out and don't comply with them their house of cards is coming down that's why
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:02.760]  the police are far from perfect they're a manifestation of us but they want control of
[2:25:02.760 --> 2:25:08.360]  those police departments they want full control as them as political operatives and they're so close
[2:25:08.360 --> 2:25:12.760]  they've got most the state attorney generals they've got most the district attorneys accounting
[2:25:12.760 --> 2:25:18.040]  attorneys uh most big city 75 percent of the cops are leftists though they kind of wake up a little
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:22.440]  bit later when they're being screamed at you know you're not part of the power structure when you
[2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:28.200]  serve the new rule order you're a schmuck you're an idiot you're a sucker you're a mark you're
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:33.960]  you're you're you're somebody who's been scammed you're a useful idiot and and so we can move on
[2:25:33.960 --> 2:25:38.200]  to ignore those people but i think we should also reach out to them sometimes because they've got
[2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:43.640]  to understand what they're doing is very destructive well alex my approach to things lately have been
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:51.080]  an attempt of try to remoralize if you will or just get get people to understand that you know
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:55.880]  we're still fighting america's not dead we're having victories and i know we were kind of
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:25:59.560]  discussing earlier but we are all hell's breaking loose because they want to finish the job but
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:04.920]  like for example i mean i i don't want to live my life i mean folks you know when when you when you
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:08.440]  are in the info war i mean you're in the info war it's like the last thing i want to do is turn
[2:26:08.440 --> 2:26:14.360]  my life into a 24 7 political clown show you know where i'm constantly having to do but notice you
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:19.400]  could say oh info wars is obsessed but notice how what we were saying is now everything yeah
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:23.400]  because they because this we were already aware of what was coming now it's here so you can try
[2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:26.840]  to tune this out you go out there on the street buddy it's out there right now well there's no
[2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:30.760]  getting away from it now and that's why and i know i told this i keep saying it and it's like
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:35.080]  oh okay why do you keep telling me this well i wear trump at every day to the gym so people can see
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:38.760]  and i know most people probably like trump there's gonna be a couple people that don't but you have
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:43.400]  to exercise it to let them know you never will and to let them know they're not alone and you
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:47.800]  don't have to be afraid you don't have to be bullied by these people believe me the last thing i want
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:53.080]  to do is to get some political confrontation oh that's the thing the left are such classic over
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:27:00.680]  the top flaming bullies i mean they're such liars and i just want people because that's what the
[2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:05.000]  biggest problem is that people aren't you know the left has done such a good job of bullying
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:09.560]  intimidating having that chilling factor on confidence on free speech so that you're just
[2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:13.160]  like look i don't even want to offend anybody so you know i'm just going to walk around in a great
[2:27:13.160 --> 2:27:17.400]  t-shirt that doesn't say anything and like you know just i just want to get about my day without
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:23.480]  being bothered by these people no screw them screw them and soon because i already know it's somebody
[2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:26.760]  wants to say hey man you know what you gotta wear your trump out of the gym but wait a second
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:32.920]  i have to i have to see your stupid mask i have to see your stupid symbol of slavery i have all
[2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:37.400]  the channels on with the fake news on i've got the sports channels on that are telling me how
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:43.080]  racist sports are in all this crap so don't sit here and bitch because you don't like my pro america
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:47.800]  symbolism but you gotta remember anti-american symbolism everywhere oh you have a symbol of
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:51.640]  pro america oh i can't have it no no no well that's why they now say you can't have an american
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:58.440]  flag guard but i agree it's the it's the exercise of symbols that is going to counter the left if
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:04.520]  we're not willing to control if we're not willing to exert control of ourselves in the third dimension
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:09.240]  to have third dimensional victories then there's no way we'll ever win this one i think that's what
[2:28:09.240 --> 2:28:15.000]  people would down get it isn't like oh it's the same old cultural leftist barking dog you kind of
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:20.200]  shoot it out they're moving to take over everything now including bankrupting us so they can dictate
[2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:25.080]  to us the terms of our surrender and they've got all these loser idiots that went to community
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:28.760]  college i'm not saying you're bad i went to mcuny college so i mean i mean the people that buy the
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:34.440]  kool aid that that that that buy in they have broken the social contract they believe if they riot
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:40.600]  and kill and hit folks they have with clubs they're going to get money and so they uh it's just like
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:45.800]  hollywood just like the media because they do they sell america out they lie they get money well low
[2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:49.720]  level folks have been told you get money and they are getting 200 bucks a day but that's why i think
[2:28:49.720 --> 2:28:53.880]  you're right that's why you're seeing the trump boat because no one's ever given 200 dollars a day
[2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:57.320]  you imagine it we had the funding to actually go hire libtards out of college they would love it
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:29:01.640]  they're like you mean i can be somebody yeah here's the constitution here's you know oh thank you
[2:29:01.640 --> 2:29:05.880]  but they they're just so alone little soy boys they're like here's your 200 dollars now go attack
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:10.840]  somebody you're a good person you're you're not a racist sorry you go go go go kill go kill i'm not
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:15.640]  a racist there's a white person they're a white person doing and this is how this is trained this
[2:29:15.640 --> 2:29:20.040]  is people raising from the tv she's got very low nutrition their mothers in breastfeeding
[2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:24.200]  and buddy they don't know what planet they're on but that's why they we have to have the
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:28.680]  optics that that's not the dominant culture you know that's the big and that's why they bring in
[2:29:28.680 --> 2:29:33.400]  the censorship to make us feel like we're alone we've got to know that's all a fraud and not buy
[2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:39.560]  into it we have to know the truth and not even look at outside stimuli imagine you know in 26
[2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:43.720]  years ago when i was doing this nobody was covering this you've got to ignore their stimuli laughing
[2:29:43.720 --> 2:29:48.600]  at you ignoring you trying to kill you and just keep transmitting the truth and they will fall
[2:29:48.600 --> 2:29:54.680]  well you know it's funny people people like to give us crap or i've had people give me crap like oh
[2:29:54.680 --> 2:29:59.160]  yeah you go out in the armored truck like oh it's like yeah they try to murder us and then in
[2:29:59.160 --> 2:30:04.680]  wisconsin two nights ago there was i believe it was a cnn crew i'm not sure it was some some television
[2:30:04.680 --> 2:30:09.480]  crew out in the streets they got attacked they had to pull away in their suburban that wasn't
[2:30:09.480 --> 2:30:14.440]  armored they were pulling away like they're about to die it's like oh oh you mean you need an armored
[2:30:14.440 --> 2:30:18.760]  truck to cover like we knew to buy one ahead of this because we're smart it's like oh you need an
[2:30:18.760 --> 2:30:23.960]  armored truck to cover leftist events now shocking i wonder who would have seen that coming so it's
[2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:29.960]  just hilarious to see uh i mean really it's sad to see but but when you see the tv news
[2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:35.080]  reaping what they sow i guess there is a bit of comedy and you know they order these hordes in
[2:30:35.080 --> 2:30:40.360]  our houses to kill our wives and children they'll do it they these are just demonic little men with
[2:30:40.360 --> 2:30:45.080]  no power who gang up and bully something we have to have a truck to go into the midst of them to
[2:30:45.080 --> 2:30:49.880]  show people what trash they are and they all said their black lives matter not one of them was black
[2:30:49.880 --> 2:30:54.680]  and you know we have to sit here in debate now these folks up in wisconsin black attack on white
[2:30:54.680 --> 2:30:59.000]  people's houses they thought was a white neighborhood it wasn't i mean this is just imagine you're in a
[2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:03.640]  apartment you're in a duplex a fourplex people are knocking your doors down man screaming i'm
[2:31:03.640 --> 2:31:07.320]  gonna get you whitey there's a there's video there's audio yeah and then the guy comes out he's like

[2:31:25.160 --> 2:31:29.960]  in this fight imagine he was around 30 years ago his father was a congressman they murdered
[2:31:29.960 --> 2:31:35.880]  his brother's been a u.s senator but he's the most influential of all the guys and they're all great
[2:31:35.880 --> 2:31:41.240]  patriots um his brother's okay but i mean his dad was a great guy he's the guy the guy's got land

[2:31:53.400 --> 2:31:58.840]  wavelength generators before they call it 5g to control your mind he's been hired by some of the
[2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:03.960]  top millionaires in the world who aren't for this to actually research it that's all secret he can't
[2:32:03.960 --> 2:32:07.480]  get into all that for you but i can just tell you a lot of stuff going on folks you don't know about
[2:32:07.480 --> 2:32:11.720]  let's just leave it at that and so there's a big fight there's not just the people you see out public

[2:35:16.920 --> 2:35:21.560]  stuff that costs the same amount it all tastes like crap so and that's what you see in the reviews
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:26.760]  that's that's what you see from the listeners now they can't go lower ever than the prices at

[2:35:51.880 --> 2:36:00.120]  being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny that's establishing a form of planetary
[2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:08.440]  digital law where the technocrats are above the law the public isn't even considered to be
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:14.520]  as valuable as a cow in fact humans are seen as garbage it's going to be taken out and removed
[2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:20.920]  that is the post-human extermination plan that is the public ideology of the globalists
[2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:28.360]  and everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and anesthetize our minds
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:34.840]  as we're slowly killed and any future generations that happen to straggle out of their mother's
[2:36:34.840 --> 2:36:42.120]  ones will be a mere shadow of what humans once were this is the satanic ruling elite
[2:36:42.120 --> 2:36:49.240]  engaged in mass vandalism against god's creation humanity this is the essence of evil the future
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:57.080]  isn't coming it's here and in the future keeping your humanity saving your soul your integrity
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:37:04.120]  your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset in fact it's going to be your only asset the
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:10.200]  world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless
[2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:18.360]  lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:25.560]  dehumanization human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:33.000]  by the year 2050 this is their stated goal i'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:39.160]  to you but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:44.680]  we turn this around you must study their own writings you must face the facts and you must
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:47.800]  come to grips with it you're all being incrementally destroyed
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:38:17.240]  well you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes and the chauffeur
[2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:27.480]  drives your cars you let everybody know but don't play with me
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:34.120]  and all these people they're scum they're trash or nobody they've got to sell their species out
[2:38:34.120 --> 2:38:39.960]  they have power over the planet so let's not get too upset let's just not let them occupy
[2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:47.240]  control the earth oh and yeah i you know it's really basic human freedom alex is really what
[2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:53.000]  it comes down to at the end of the day and it's sad that in any country let alone america
[2:38:54.040 --> 2:39:01.720]  you can't unify on basic human freedom the basic ability to control your own life self-government
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:05.800]  you know that this is collectivism i mean they're telling us we're all poisonous we're all bad we
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:11.720]  can't go outside that's all you're a bio weapon you're a bio weapon you could be carrying a virus
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:18.040]  guess what you're carrying thousands of virus i'm not gonna give the story but take the phone i mean
[2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:21.720]  i'll be in these rooms full of people these meetings and i go just take the mask i'll hate
[2:39:21.720 --> 2:39:26.120]  them too yeah let's do it that's all just you know that's the thing it's like you got a lead by example
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:29.800]  just like do it man it's like a burka though and literally they've got us to put a burka on
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:33.240]  it's incredible all right who's been holding the longest here is it chris
[2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:44.440]  chris in minnesota illan omar land new samalia welcome how do you hear me this serve
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:50.280]  great well i mean i called an hour ago about a g bar are you past that or what do you want to
[2:39:50.280 --> 2:39:53.480]  talk about no go ahead you're on air and you know whatever you want to get a bar so you're
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:59.320]  what do you think a bar olyn is very pleased with with with bar right now saying no investigation
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:06.040]  will be released during the election no i think uh i kind of lost all faith in him when he dropped a
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:12.200]  fling case kind of weird timing everyone you know uh what's what's going for it should be powerful
[2:40:12.200 --> 2:40:16.280]  well exactly and they're letting these judges do something they've never done and keep keep fling
[2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:21.320]  all oh worst trump on julina saans let's get pissed at trump we're gonna do that he told julina
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:26.040]  saans i don't care who's got the documents release them it's true hillary committed the crime but
[2:40:26.040 --> 2:40:31.240]  what's the law is protected so trump's biggest failure now is julina saans it's shameful and he
[2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:36.120]  better when he wins the election he better pardon him reportedly though saans is like out of his
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:42.280]  mind i mean i would be too seven eight years all during confinement yeah well i would bar wait
[2:40:42.280 --> 2:40:46.200]  three years to oh it's a sham investigation you knew that three years ago why is he waiting
[2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:50.760]  till six hundred documents get released by the FBI showing all their malfeasance and all the
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:55.560]  crimes that trump ordered that release and it likes a fire under bar's ass and bar goes sorry
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:41:00.280]  we're not going to be political during the election and by the way justice be done when the
[2:41:00.280 --> 2:41:05.240]  heavens fall everything's political but they committed these crimes to stop who we elected
[2:41:05.240 --> 2:41:09.720]  that's what matters screw the establishment what about we the people thank you for the call
[2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:15.480]  yeah and i think that president trump i mean it's obviously worse than anybody could imagine
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:22.360]  how corrupted is in dc oh i can imagine and so president trump today was asking because you
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:26.680]  know he assumes the best in people he's a good guy he doesn't screw people over on business deals
[2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:31.000]  he wants to help the country so he's just assumes well you know everybody is like that right everybody
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:36.120]  wants to help america everybody wants to have a good business deal no no he's found out for three
[2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:40.680]  and a half years in dc nobody in dc wants to help america nobody in dc wants to have fair deals
[2:41:40.680 --> 2:41:45.160]  and so he was asking today on its virtual rally why is that why is that so i don't know if that's
[2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:49.880]  the president like showing his naivety saying really why now he's putting pressure on him
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:56.280]  a second or is he saying folks it's time to start asking why well he said last night that's the real
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:01.400]  answer of what bar just did trump said it's time for bar to start arresting people like obama
[2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:05.480]  and bar goes no i'm not going to so that was a political response right back that's really the
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:10.520]  takeaway here you're asking why i did it trump said arresting it's not political he's like these
[2:42:10.520 --> 2:42:15.000]  are criminals they do this to me yeah like if a guy comes and mugs me or you know spies on me
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:18.520]  illegal he should get in trouble so i go follow complaint with the police i call it's not like
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:23.320]  it's political hey a guy just robbed me it just mugged me oh sir that's political you just got
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:27.240]  robbed but like when a black guy robs a white guy they do that now they go oh that's a black guy we
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:31.080]  can't report it again this is all politics because they want to set the president they don't care about
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:35.320]  black people they want to set the president to pick and choose who to prosecute and when you
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:47.000]  got that you got tyranny ian in utah a beautiful state go ahead ian hey alex welcome so um i wanted
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:55.400]  to get into the october surprise is the ag bar stuff but before i get into that i have one question
[2:42:55.400 --> 2:43:01.480]  so i already know that the un they have a big headquarters up in salt lake city i'm just wondering
[2:43:02.120 --> 2:43:07.960]  what their agenda would look like in utah it's the same agenda everywhere ship in a bunch of
[2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:13.000]  third world people to exploit turn about against each other the un's tax exemptions run scams
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:18.200]  bunch of kids get kidnapped locally flaunt flown out on un aircraft and you're right utah's got a
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:24.760]  big nest of un and uh austin's got a nest new york san francisco but all the big cities have un
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:31.880]  nest now yeah they had the un event in utah salt lake city this year right uh yeah i believe so and
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:36.600]  they're also importing lots of mollies up there too so i think oh yeah and then they all vote because
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:44.760]  they're told to right one person so they bring in different tribes where they only got to buy
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:50.840]  off one tribal leader and you don't do what the tribal leader says they kill you so we're not against
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:54.920]  some mollies we're against their tribal form of government and that their people are slaves
[2:43:54.920 --> 2:43:59.160]  whoever the top some mollies and the democrats bring them in and then have a voting block you
[2:43:59.160 --> 2:44:04.120]  wonder why you go to an airport like seattle or portland or the apple of saint paul wherever and
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:10.200]  it's like all some mollies baggage clerks everyone you're like how'd they only hire one group because
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:15.880]  the local chief says anyone has had a line there's no unions there's no they're they'll they'll they'll
[2:44:15.880 --> 2:44:22.360]  kill you and then nothing said that's why poor some mollies it's a slave class they brought
[2:44:22.360 --> 2:44:27.880]  into america i feel so sorry for him ian thank you for the call let's go ahead and talk to
[2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:35.720]  bart in georgia bart go ahead hey alex is uh it's an honor to talk to you i just want to say if i were
[2:44:35.720 --> 2:44:42.440]  trump i would i would tell bar you have to on monday morning nine o'clock for a high profile
[2:44:42.440 --> 2:44:47.160]  arrest or indictment or your fire period what's he waiting for and while you're at it christopher
[2:44:47.160 --> 2:44:50.840]  ray and the list goes on and on i agree then they'll run to congress to say that's political
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:54.600]  interference no it's not he's not doing his damn duty when it's cut and dry he's got to do it but
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:45:01.160]  again they spin it though that oh it's political if he doesn't well that's like saying oh the the
[2:45:01.160 --> 2:45:06.680]  the terrorists are going to be mad at us if we crack down on them which is what they used to say
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:14.200]  under obama exactly well i mean it's true that here's the old republicans have done a bunch of
[2:45:14.200 --> 2:45:19.240]  bad stuff not trump because they they use it if they had it that's a pragmatic statement not like
[2:45:19.240 --> 2:45:24.200]  a defending trump so they're all blackmailing each other so it's really going on i mean and
[2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:28.920]  that's what keeps that's why they use pedophiles to take over churches and stuff because once they
[2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:32.920]  you're not a pedophile but once you cover it up now they got your ass you know that works or or
[2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:37.400]  they get you to a certain level of success and then you know okay well if i want to get initiated
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:41.480]  it's like a gang initiation okay you got to go shoot a cop you got to go you know kill a member

[2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:46.360]  the alex jones show
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:51:01.880]  all right john's a holdover an evil american i'm evil american too i'm just going to see
[2:51:01.880 --> 2:51:06.760]  where the destroyer we've got dr. nick baggins taking over here in just a moment but i want to
[2:51:06.760 --> 2:51:12.040]  get to everybody else too but john finish your point about uh we can't count on government go
[2:51:12.040 --> 2:51:17.160]  ahead just real quick until i get to my second point the bar is not going to solve the problem i
[2:51:17.160 --> 2:51:22.680]  knew bar was not you know going to do anything you know i think the entire apparatus in dc and the
[2:51:22.680 --> 2:51:28.520]  federal government is just a complete yeah they have a term don't hold your breath exactly but uh
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:34.200]  one thing i want to touch on that's so important to me because every host on info wars and probably
[2:51:34.200 --> 2:51:40.600]  everywhere else screws this up to the nth degree which is anarchy anarchy simply means
[2:51:40.600 --> 2:51:47.640]  without rulers that you have the highest claim to your life your body and your property and nobody
[2:51:47.640 --> 2:51:52.360]  has a higher claim than you that is what anarchy means it does not mean chaos so every time we
[2:51:52.360 --> 2:51:56.840]  refer to no i mean i get one definition is that you're totally right but a lot of leftist claim
[2:51:56.840 --> 2:52:01.880]  they're anarchist do you know what i'm saying yeah but chaos anarchy absolutely in no uncertain
[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:07.720]  terms does not mean chaos right looting nothing like it just means you don't want to be ruled
[2:52:07.720 --> 2:52:13.000]  and it doesn't mean no ruler or no rules because it's okay to have rules but you know it goes on
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:19.160]  with the non-aggression we love you an interesting point thank you oh yeah i mean you can get into
[2:52:19.160 --> 2:52:24.280]  semantics all day long i mean i may not ever claim to be an anarchist i don't think i ever would
[2:52:24.280 --> 2:52:28.440]  anyway but it's self-government to me i mean it's self-government it's independent i'd rather have
[2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:34.040]  that than communism yeah i mean and you can talk about anarchists all day long uh i think the reason
[2:52:34.040 --> 2:52:41.000]  why people shy away from the phrase or the idea is because it does have a connotation of i guess
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:46.760]  as he said chaos well there's an i am an antichrist i am an anarchist songs and i just think it's
[2:52:46.760 --> 2:52:51.560]  again it's all about semantics it's about self-government independence and once they've
[2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:56.200]  domesticated everybody to say we're gonna egg segue right into anarchy isn't gonna work in anarchy
[2:52:56.200 --> 2:53:01.080]  you could not have built what we built in america you needed a republic for that let's go ahead and
[2:53:01.080 --> 2:53:10.280]  talk to steve steve on in texas go ahead hey alex jones and uh oh and the liberal destroyer
[2:53:10.280 --> 2:53:15.000]  shroyer yes sir forever me on guys uh i just wanted to get to a quick point everyone's going
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:19.880]  about ag bar and you know yeah what he did with general flin was disgusting you know and he just
[2:53:19.880 --> 2:53:24.520]  dropped it and he didn't do anything about it trump actually had to come out and defend flin when
[2:53:24.520 --> 2:53:30.360]  ag bar wouldn't and now he's uh you know he's going against everything that trump has said he
[2:53:30.360 --> 2:53:35.800]  was going to do and he's like after the election and then going on that point joe biden said yesterday
[2:53:35.800 --> 2:53:41.480]  in phoenix he was like i'm not going to tell anybody my packing of supreme court my decision
[2:53:41.480 --> 2:53:45.880]  on that until after the election now ag bar's like i'm not going to do anything with these
[2:53:45.880 --> 2:53:52.120]  indictments till after the election i don't know i smell a load of bs and uh real quick alex i just
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:54:05.880]  wanted to give a good freedom yell if i may like that yeah but uh but uh anyway i love you guys very
[2:54:05.880 --> 2:54:09.560]  much and uh thanks for taking my call and uh making those points we love you
[2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:13.400]  john and florida go ahead
[2:54:16.040 --> 2:54:20.680]  hello hello john we have one minute 27 seconds we are honored to have you thank you please communicate
[2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:28.200]  with us how you doing uh alex i want to talk about bar real quick um i never thought he would do
[2:54:28.200 --> 2:54:35.640]  anything he was i i ran contra hold over exactly um yeah and you know it's just it's pretty obvious
[2:54:35.640 --> 2:54:42.440]  i think you knew that i wanted to also talk about q i hear you talking about q a lot and i've looked
[2:54:42.440 --> 2:54:46.920]  up q a little bit when they first came out and then i kind of fell off because they're retarded
[2:54:46.920 --> 2:54:54.040]  um i don't think anyone knows what q stands for and what it actually stands for is quantitative
[2:54:54.040 --> 2:54:59.320]  quantitative language so when you're representing yourself in court you need to speak properly so
[2:54:59.320 --> 2:55:03.000]  that the stenographer can write everything down because you're paying them a hundred dollars an hour
[2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:09.240]  most people don't realize that what q means is quantitative and the people who run q are not
[2:55:09.240 --> 2:55:16.600]  quantitative at all they're retarded they're like retarded little nerds i wish we could so i'm not
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:21.160]  even bashing q a lot of people like it but yeah it's esoteric it's not like like numbers that go
[2:55:21.160 --> 2:55:25.880]  together so oh this and that like meanwhile the whole thing's going down and it just seems like a
[2:55:25.880 --> 2:55:30.920]  con game to me john i'm sorry out of time jason i'm sorry we've got our nick begat you i love
[2:55:30.920 --> 2:55:36.600]  caking over then oh and shroyer in 55 minutes with the war room big show i'm told of it huge show
[2:55:36.600 --> 2:55:41.400]  it's always a huge show you got ivan radkin defense intelligence agency on who's pissed
[2:55:41.400 --> 2:55:43.880]  who's pissed so big stuff coming up stay with us
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:53.000]  the globalists are very very honest about their planetary goals they want private corporate
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  governance above nation states above religious institutions above the family they want total
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:06.920]  corporate power there was a great film back in the early 1970s called rollerball with james kahn
[2:56:07.560 --> 2:56:14.920]  that's based on a novel set in the year 2020 and in the book you have mega corporations that control
[2:56:14.920 --> 2:56:21.800]  the planet and there are no longer nation states there are only cities that are the capitals of
[2:56:21.800 --> 2:56:27.720]  the corporations well if you actually read what the most group of the cfr and reliant commission say
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:33.880]  in the year 2020 that is their in game that is their goal so we're talking about a hunger games
[2:56:33.880 --> 2:56:39.880]  type scenario here run by very very very ruthless people see us as shadow they're using
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:45.000]  covid-19 as their takeover strategy and communist china as their model we must reject it now
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:50.280]  this is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of texas and us resistance
[2:56:50.280 --> 2:56:54.840]  against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by communist china allied with the big
[2:56:54.840 --> 2:57:00.680]  megabanks that set up communist china in 1949 the communist chinese have taken control of us
[2:57:00.680 --> 2:57:04.760]  telecommunications infrastructure the communist chinese have taken control of hollywood the
[2:57:04.760 --> 2:57:08.760]  communist chinese have taken control of the main universities this is all confirmed this is not a
[2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:13.400]  drill big tech and silicon valley is almost completely run by the communist chinese government
[2:57:13.400 --> 2:57:19.160]  they've officially become state-run apple 100 google is now making the transition and announcing
[2:57:19.160 --> 2:57:25.400]  a merger and total worldwide censorship they are now beta testing using me as the straw man a demonized
[2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:30.040]  version of alex jones to do that this is happening this is not like the other probes before that
[2:57:30.040 --> 2:57:35.080]  we're meant to get you used to probes and censorship thinking you would adapt to censorship by just
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:40.680]  putting up with it now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude
[2:57:40.680 --> 2:57:46.440]  of all previous attacks this is a tide-trained dose reverse psychological warfare operation
[2:57:46.440 --> 2:57:52.760]  using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation in layman's terms they are manipulating
[2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:57.480]  the fact that we adapt to being oppressed we adapt to being pressed with the low dosages
[2:57:57.480 --> 2:58:04.440]  of oppression now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[2:58:04.440 --> 2:58:10.520]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose total internet of things
[2:58:10.520 --> 2:58:15.960]  integration global social score complete command and control system it is the virtual reality ai
[2:58:15.960 --> 2:58:21.320]  platform system now attacking the united states with traders inside the major security agencies
[2:58:21.320 --> 2:58:26.040]  blocking trumps resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles
[2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:30.760]  of the chai con slash big tech making combine emergency situation i have been chosen for
[2:58:30.760 --> 2:58:34.760]  destruction because i brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out as much
[2:58:34.760 --> 2:58:41.560]  as i can they want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[2:58:41.560 --> 2:58:47.720]  where every angle of my good is turned against us so they take what i've said being sincere build me
[2:58:47.720 --> 2:58:52.840]  into an insincere person in the straw man a person that cares about life and children and is against
[2:58:52.840 --> 2:58:58.120]  these wars and so they make me a herder of children and then they build me into this lie to then set
[2:58:58.120 --> 2:59:03.800]  the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about alex jones so
[2:59:03.800 --> 2:59:09.720]  even if i didn't sell out to them they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main
[2:59:09.720 --> 2:59:15.000]  distraction i have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fault from
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:20.600]  has been used against you only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this
[2:59:20.600 --> 2:59:31.080]  paradigm i have given you the transmission now break free i have sworn upon the altar of god
[2:59:31.080 --> 2:59:40.760]  eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man thomas jefferson if you are
[2:59:40.760 --> 2:59:56.200]  receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[2:59:56.200 --> 3:00:02.520]  it's alex jones and now your host nick baggage
[3:00:05.960 --> 3:00:10.760]  and welcome back you know it's uh good to be here you know thinking about that jefferson quote we
[3:00:10.760 --> 3:00:17.160]  just heard boy doesn't that ring uh true and you know thinking about today's uh program as i was
[3:00:17.160 --> 3:00:23.320]  rolling into it and kind of contemplating what would i cover today and then just a few minutes ago
[3:00:23.320 --> 3:00:29.160]  i just totally flipped it around and uh in a conversation uh with an here at the house and
[3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:35.320]  here's the deal i want to talk about some things going back in time because i've been in a couple
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:41.320]  of dialogues in the last month i just did a segment for a program called unexplained i guess a tv or
[3:00:41.320 --> 3:00:46.040]  netflix i don't watch tv so i don't really know but i did a segment for them and i did another
[3:00:46.040 --> 3:00:53.960]  segment uh for america's um secrets i think it's called uh anyway it's it's coming up and so thinking
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:59.000]  about that they had asked me you know how would you encapsulate all this you know how would you
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:04.760]  how would you see all this in terms of unfolding in the future and as i thought about it and i
[3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:12.040]  started thinking about that it took me back to where i really the very beginnings um of my work
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:18.680]  and it was a long time ago it's 50 years ago uh and i consider it when i was about 12 okay when
[3:01:18.680 --> 3:01:25.080]  i was 12 years old i was contemplating a lot of different things and starting to really start to
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:31.480]  look at you know what what makes up the world how does it really work and and then i started thinking
[3:01:31.480 --> 3:01:38.200]  about where's the world going right and by the time i was uh 14 i had this concept and it was
[3:01:38.200 --> 3:01:45.800]  information communication and transportation and i said then this is 50 years ago that these are the
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:51.240]  things that would drive the last part of the century and going into the next one and here we are
[3:01:51.240 --> 3:01:58.120]  you know think about it um this would have taken us back into the uh early 1970s and if you think
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:04.600]  about it there were no computers as such there were the big mainframes the big clunky mainframes
[3:02:04.600 --> 3:02:10.440]  that would do what you can do on a watch now you know they filled up the building um so information
[3:02:10.440 --> 3:02:16.200]  hadn't really broke broke free all right and then the communications side from alaska in those days
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:23.880]  a telephone call would be like six seven dollars in those dollars a minute all right so communication
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:28.040]  obviously has changed we can call virtually anywhere in the world virtually for free we use
[3:02:28.040 --> 3:02:33.320]  some of the apps that are out there or we use skype or zoom or or we use a standard cell phone i
[3:02:33.320 --> 3:02:40.760]  mean it's so cheap to communicate right so you have the the information revolution the communication
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:44.920]  revolution and then of course the transportation revolution because you look at transportation
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:50.920]  from the 1970s and airfares i can fly for less money round trip to washington dc today
[3:02:51.560 --> 3:02:57.640]  than i could back then in today's dollars so think about that what a ticket used to cost
[3:02:57.640 --> 3:03:04.600]  in terms of your annual income you know big numbers so transportation reduced communication
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:09.960]  reduced and expanded information reduced and expanded and you know when i started doing this
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:15.480]  public were about a quarter of a century ago and alex refers to it often he says you know
[3:03:15.480 --> 3:03:20.920]  here's the guy that predicted you know where we would be right now but i gotta tell you is today
[3:03:20.920 --> 3:03:28.920]  i want to lay out where i think we're going on the same level i laid it out in my own head
[3:03:28.920 --> 3:03:37.160]  when i was 12 but now we have a new shift a new paradigm shift something so dramatic so incredible
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:41.480]  and we are at the threshold of it a whole lot of people are checking out right now if you haven't
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:47.560]  noticed a lot of people are leaving they're not going to stay here for what's coming but what's
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:54.600]  coming is two things the wave which always looks so horrible and then the calm which is a whole
[3:03:54.600 --> 3:04:00.120]  different ballgame and that's really what i want to talk about where are we going and these radio
[3:04:00.120 --> 3:04:03.960]  and television producers that i've worked with lately have been drawing that out of me a little bit
[3:04:04.840 --> 3:04:11.560]  and taking me back to where where i began and then i want to talk about this where are we
[3:04:11.560 --> 3:04:18.680]  we're in the merger of technology the convergence of technologies that are so dramatic
[3:04:19.320 --> 3:04:25.640]  it's going to be the difference between the horse and buggy okay between the horse and buggy
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:33.000]  and an inner galactic airship okay this is the the bandwidth that we're about to see
[3:04:34.120 --> 3:04:39.560]  unfold in the next 20 to 25 years maybe even sooner because a couple of these things could
[3:04:39.560 --> 3:04:44.520]  accelerate this dramatically so i want to talk about that let's first talk about
[3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:53.240]  nanotechnologies okay things that are very very small so small that they don't behave in the way
[3:04:53.240 --> 3:04:58.680]  that physics tells us particles should behave so within this realm there's been a lot of new
[3:04:58.680 --> 3:05:04.280]  discovery that's taking us a very different direction in terms of biotechnologies the things
[3:05:04.280 --> 3:05:09.400]  about living organisms we've learned a lot is taking us in another new direction when you think of
[3:05:09.400 --> 3:05:15.640]  information technologies and ai and what that brings takes us again in a new direction when you
[3:05:15.640 --> 3:05:22.600]  begin to merge the technologies of the 21st century into what they are they will either liberate us
[3:05:22.600 --> 3:05:30.440]  or they will create the 1984 gulag like this world has never seen you know when we look forward to
[3:05:30.440 --> 3:05:37.480]  the future and how it unfolds and where it goes a lot has yet to be seen where we're headed in
[3:05:37.480 --> 3:05:43.880]  the 21st century is going to change the very way we see the world and that's the thing that we're
[3:05:43.880 --> 3:05:51.000]  preparing for at this moment in this time as we move forward and as we move forward together in
[3:05:51.000 --> 3:05:59.640]  all of this we have to reframe our own future we have to reframe where we're headed and where
[3:05:59.640 --> 3:06:07.160]  we're going and when we come back i want to talk more about where the 21st century takes us and
[3:06:07.160 --> 3:06:13.720]  how we can get there and you know when when when we come back i want to get into the details of
[3:06:13.720 --> 3:06:20.760]  how a surveillance technology is now overlaying so much of who we are so much of where we are
[3:06:20.760 --> 3:06:27.960]  in this century you know it's time it's time for a change it's time to wake up and see the world in
[3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:40.760]  a very very different way as dr nick baggage will be right back after these brief messages
[3:06:44.600 --> 3:06:49.960]  2020 election center dot com just type it in one time you've got to save right there in your
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:56.600]  browser and then you can share it on twitter facebook youtube apple platforms but most importantly
[3:06:56.600 --> 3:07:04.280]  via text message email or by word of mouth because they have banned the links to ban dot video
[3:07:04.280 --> 3:07:10.360]  but 2020 election center dot com is a clone of the science the exact same links the exact same
[3:07:10.360 --> 3:07:17.240]  videos we can comment you can share them everything the system is censoring because the power of the
[3:07:17.240 --> 3:07:21.800]  people overrode them four years ago trump has finally figured this out since he's going to take
[3:07:21.800 --> 3:07:26.600]  action once reelected against big tech and then he's modern the situation well we know the president's
[3:07:26.600 --> 3:07:31.080]  overwhelmed right now so we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action we the people
[3:07:31.080 --> 3:07:35.480]  are taking action now you can do it very very easily by sharing 2020 election center dot com
[3:07:35.480 --> 3:07:40.920]  2020 election center dot com and checking out the new redesign info wars dot com and sharing that
[3:07:40.920 --> 3:07:47.160]  hope that's really upset some oh yeah we've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown
[3:07:47.160 --> 3:07:52.280]  and it's horrible and it's killing millions of people via starvation but the good news is it's
[3:07:52.280 --> 3:07:59.320]  caused a planetary awakening as well the general public all over the planet hate bill gates he's
[3:07:59.320 --> 3:08:05.400]  the most unpopular person on earth people know he's not a doctor people know he's a eugenicist
[3:08:05.400 --> 3:08:11.560]  the population knows that his vaccines that he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses polio
[3:08:11.560 --> 3:08:17.640]  steroids and more it's even in the associated press so now they are beginning to understand
[3:08:17.640 --> 3:08:23.560]  that we the people know that there is a corporate global government and the beast top tech billionaires
[3:08:23.560 --> 3:08:28.920]  sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war scams and coronavirus scams that we're
[3:08:28.920 --> 3:08:35.320]  witnessing so remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've done
[3:08:35.320 --> 3:08:41.960]  and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization they are the enemies of humanity
[3:08:41.960 --> 3:09:07.320]  they want you dead you're listening to the alex jones show the alex jones show because there
[3:09:07.320 --> 3:09:19.160]  is a war on for your mind with nick baggage and there is a war on for your mind and you know
[3:09:19.160 --> 3:09:24.600]  today we're talking about sort of where some of my thoughts about where the future would go
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:29.960]  starting 50 years ago and as we went into the break i was talking about kind of when i started
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:34.360]  the public work 25 years ago and started laying out sort of what was going to come
[3:09:34.360 --> 3:09:41.640]  and this wasn't done in some weird esoteric kind of predictive model this was done by analyzing a
[3:09:41.640 --> 3:09:46.840]  tremendous amount of data and then distilling it down and then appropriately referencing it so
[3:09:46.840 --> 3:09:52.440]  people could go look it up you know see it for yourself know what what that all means and and
[3:09:52.440 --> 3:09:57.320]  as i look at kind of the platform that we're sitting on now i want to talk about some of these
[3:09:57.320 --> 3:10:04.680]  technologies and why when they merge it creates such a different kind of revolution and technologies
[3:10:04.680 --> 3:10:12.120]  and i would say that the dividing line in this century is a is a line between the material
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:20.600]  the physical the materialistic view of science or a different view of science in terms of materialism
[3:10:20.600 --> 3:10:25.640]  that also takes in an energetic dimension a multi-dimensional dimension one that the physics
[3:10:25.640 --> 3:10:34.120]  the modern physics points to an ancient religious thought tries to explain in a very different
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:40.760]  way and so what you see is knowledge coming together and the conclusion of some of the
[3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:48.600]  advanced thinkers is wow there is a god there is consciousness there is something greater than us
[3:10:48.600 --> 3:10:54.360]  you know that's a great starting point for a new a new way of seeing the world right i mean
[3:10:54.360 --> 3:11:01.160]  if we can merge the science with a value system now we might really have something right instead
[3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:06.600]  of separating them which is what we did 500 years ago in the middle ages i was in a conference
[3:11:07.400 --> 3:11:13.240]  a number of years ago that brought in a bunch of people i mean they were the globalist of globalists
[3:11:13.240 --> 3:11:19.000]  i got to tell you they really were but their thought was that we kind of screwed that up
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:24.040]  because they split this and then they're trying to bring it back together but in a way that is not
[3:11:24.040 --> 3:11:31.080]  not necessarily so good because we're creating with technology the illusion using materialism to
[3:11:31.080 --> 3:11:37.160]  create an illusion for the spiritual when in fact you don't need anything material to have the
[3:11:37.160 --> 3:11:43.640]  spiritual and i think this is the conflict between high technologies in the modern world as i as i
[3:11:43.640 --> 3:11:49.320]  look at so let's talk about quantum computing as a starting point for the conversation quantum
[3:11:49.320 --> 3:11:54.520]  computing when i was doing a lot of work in this now 20 years ago looking at what that meant
[3:11:55.640 --> 3:12:01.640]  then you could do 280 teraflops a second with a supercomputer around 20 years ago now what is that
[3:12:01.640 --> 3:12:06.200]  you know for us that's all a bunch of chinese language might we know what that means but here's
[3:12:06.200 --> 3:12:13.240]  what it means in a simpler way of illustration 280 teraflops would be like taking seven billion
[3:12:13.240 --> 3:12:20.680]  people giving them a hand calculator and and every 60 seconds every minute they do a calculation
[3:12:20.680 --> 3:12:27.160]  for 60 hours everybody on the planet running a calculator for 60 hours and you get one second
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:34.200]  of a supercomputer 20 years ago i mean can you even wrap your head around it everybody running a
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:40.120]  calculator for 60 hours and that's a second of computing power 20 years ago so what is computing
[3:12:40.120 --> 3:12:47.800]  power that very computer i just described imagine that computer running for a trillion years hey not
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:56.440]  a second a trillion years that's what a quantum computer will do in one hour that's heavy duty
[3:12:56.440 --> 3:13:03.080]  in one hour a trillion years is a supercomputer all those billions of people for that wow why is
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:10.760]  that so important because that dissipates all security systems all encryption systems instantly
[3:13:11.720 --> 3:13:17.720]  that takes all of the data stored on you and every data bank on the planet every data bit
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:22.440]  allows it to be correlated instantly or virtually instantly it might as well be
[3:13:22.440 --> 3:13:33.000]  to the point where predictive models are like 99.9 it's almost supernatural right
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:39.560]  almost but not quite because it denies the inner power of it but it gives you the illusion of it
[3:13:40.200 --> 3:13:47.160]  that's where we are on the nano side of quantum computing now you take that kind of computing
[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:52.280]  and you mix it with something else and let's let's take the next thing on the list
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:14:00.520]  nano technologies miniaturization making mechanisms so small right so very very small
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:08.280]  we start manipulating things at a nano level elementally you know in the old ancient world
[3:14:08.280 --> 3:14:14.360]  they call that alchemy you know mixing elements to create new compounds well that's chemistry also
[3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:19.000]  that's where chemistry began as crazy as that sounds look it up that's how it happened
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:26.600]  but here we are now at a different level of chemistry looking at miniaturization and recombinations
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:34.040]  wow that's a heavy-duty concept now let me throw another one on this pile of concepts so let's put
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:40.440]  on this superconductivity now this is the idea of transferring energy from one place to another
[3:14:40.440 --> 3:14:46.120]  without what's called line loss or you might think of it as friction when the power is going through
[3:14:46.120 --> 3:14:50.840]  you know how how electronic devices heat up well that's energy loss it's going somewhere it's converting
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:55.560]  to eat and going away so the further you get from a transmission source the more inefficient it is to
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:14:59.800]  move the energy around the planet so they don't that's why we have power grids or interconnected
[3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:05.480]  but superconductivity eliminates the need for the same type of power grid because
[3:15:05.480 --> 3:15:10.920]  you don't have line loss so what that means is you can generate power at the point of production
[3:15:10.920 --> 3:15:17.480]  so like for instance for natural gas instead of building pipelines through places and ships to
[3:15:17.480 --> 3:15:22.680]  liquefy and liquefaction plants and deliquification plants and all this to move natural gas around
[3:15:23.320 --> 3:15:29.560]  you just produce with magnodynamic generators which are very efficient modern generators for
[3:15:29.560 --> 3:15:34.360]  gas conversion you produce energy right there and then you transfer it wherever you want it on the
[3:15:34.360 --> 3:15:41.400]  planet through a system of zero conductivity makes it very very efficient and frees up tremendous
[3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:47.640]  natural resources for other uses this is why innovation matters not going back to the grass
[3:15:47.640 --> 3:15:54.040]  hut but figuring out how do we balance our act in a way in a world of abundance and that's really
[3:15:54.040 --> 3:15:59.480]  what i want to get into here because that's my predictive model is we're moving away from a world
[3:15:59.480 --> 3:16:06.760]  of shortage into the recognition of abundance this is a very different way of seeing the world
[3:16:06.760 --> 3:16:15.880]  but what's happening is the artificial side of that abundance is being skewed under a cascade of
[3:16:15.880 --> 3:16:23.720]  fear anxiety all of the things that withdraw that suck the very life energy that is our core
[3:16:23.720 --> 3:16:30.760]  core and this is the thing you know embodied in what i'm trying to do here on info wars it's not
[3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:40.680]  just to inform so we can be equipped but it but but help us recognize the power that can drive us
[3:16:40.680 --> 3:16:45.560]  into a better way of seeing the world and that comes from an internal reassessment
[3:16:46.120 --> 3:16:50.760]  that i think all of us are going through and this lockdown has kind of forced it it's one of the
[3:16:50.760 --> 3:16:57.240]  unintended consequences because it requires us to reflect and then it requires us to project that
[3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:02.040]  reflection outward again in a different way with our power again because now we have at least a few
[3:17:02.040 --> 3:17:09.560]  moments the contemplate who we are what we are where we're going and how we're going to get there
[3:17:09.560 --> 3:17:15.640]  and that builds the confidence of a change that builds the projection of where we're headed for a
[3:17:15.640 --> 3:17:22.200]  change we can either be whipped up by that wave i described earlier and be carried away with it
[3:17:22.760 --> 3:17:28.600]  or we can ride that wave to its conclusion back into the calm of the surf this is dr
[3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:33.800]  nick baggage i'm here on info wars i want you to remember my website earth pulse dot com and sign
[3:17:33.800 --> 3:17:38.840]  up there for a free newsletter we're going to get those out very important support these networks
[3:17:38.840 --> 3:17:47.800]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement everyone knows we need to be so sufficient
[3:17:47.800 --> 3:17:52.120]  everyone with half a brain knows you need to have terrible food that's high quality nutritious and
[3:17:52.120 --> 3:17:57.400]  lasts a long time we've got the best sponsor they've got the food they're ready to ship it to you
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:18:01.800]  but they're gonna have to go up on prices in the next few months because of the shortages that have
[3:18:01.800 --> 3:18:06.840]  begun they have the food on hand they're ready to ship it out within a week to a week and a half but
[3:18:06.840 --> 3:18:14.200]  not for much longer so they are allowing us this last time big deal it's been extended three days
[3:18:14.200 --> 3:18:20.200]  specials on top of their biggest specials ever and prepare with alex dot com prepare with alex dot
[3:18:20.200 --> 3:18:26.120]  com has even better deals than info or store dot com we're their biggest distributor so contractually
[3:18:26.120 --> 3:18:30.280]  we have to sell the same price that they sell up the distributors do this is already a great deal
[3:18:30.280 --> 3:18:36.440]  but again prepare with alex dot com they're able to do a promotion on one year six month and three
[3:18:36.440 --> 3:18:41.800]  month supplies six hundred bucks off on a year and it goes from there go to prepare with alex dot com
[3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:49.560]  computer research scientists engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and put
[3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:55.720]  out detailed reports at tablet magazine documenting what any trained eye could already see as plain
[3:18:55.720 --> 3:19:01.640]  as day communist chinese working in tandem with the united nations and the democratic party in
[3:19:01.640 --> 3:19:07.880]  united states as well as the media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like
[3:19:07.880 --> 3:19:13.960]  day of the dead into the world in china earlier this year then the un put out standardized rules
[3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:19.480]  designed to keep the west locked down when china reopened within three months this is the greatest
[3:19:19.480 --> 3:19:27.400]  strategic coup ever this is 21st century warfare being carried out through psychological means
[3:19:27.400 --> 3:19:33.000]  or the ultimate style paul joseph watson has written about it at info wars dot com myself alex
[3:19:33.000 --> 3:19:37.640]  jones david i know insurer covering this heavily this is the way to bring down the globalist is
[3:19:37.640 --> 3:19:45.000]  exposing how communist china the un were behind the hysteria introducing info wars life pure
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:53.240]  tumeric extract this is taken under the tongue it is pure tumeric it goes together very well with
[3:19:53.240 --> 3:19:59.240]  our bodies ultimate tumeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach
[3:19:59.240 --> 3:20:04.840]  and intestines this is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also
[3:20:04.840 --> 3:20:10.280]  is then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an intense delivery system the two formulas are
[3:20:10.280 --> 3:20:14.840]  different but both are concentrates and our first product got rave reviews we've now been testing
[3:20:14.840 --> 3:20:20.280]  this out for several months some of our staff like it more than bodies some like bodies better for me

[3:20:41.720 --> 3:20:48.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:21:01.400 --> 3:21:10.680]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's nick baggage you're listening to the alex
[3:21:10.680 --> 3:21:17.880]  jones show and welcome back and it's good to be here again on this uh
[3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:23.160]  friday afternoon in most the world and just before noon here in angkush alaska and as i
[3:21:23.160 --> 3:21:27.800]  again as i look forward to what's what's happening you know there's a lot of obviously
[3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:33.400]  unsettling times for all the things that are happening right now and and i'm talking about
[3:21:33.400 --> 3:21:39.400]  these technologies not um to alarm people but again to inform what's coming because as we start to see
[3:21:39.400 --> 3:21:45.320]  it unfold it will really look miraculous and and don't be fooled i mean don't be fooled by high
[3:21:45.320 --> 3:21:51.240]  technology because this is really going to be different i mean this is really going to be
[3:21:51.240 --> 3:21:58.040]  different so i was talking about uh the quantum computing side i talked about um nanotechnologies
[3:21:58.040 --> 3:22:04.520]  a bit i talked about uh superconductivity a bit um i want to talk about data generally because this
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:10.120]  has been the thing that that i've been dealing with for a very long time as i've explored the area
[3:22:10.120 --> 3:22:18.360]  and everybody said so many said i should say that it doesn't don't worry don't worry you know we
[3:22:18.360 --> 3:22:22.200]  heard that a lot because no one can ever do anything with this data and what i just explained on
[3:22:22.200 --> 3:22:28.360]  quantum computing explains how they can't now i want to wrap this a little bit around um the
[3:22:28.360 --> 3:22:33.960]  ai concept because what's happened with ai and i and i read a lot of journals i mean i read a lot
[3:22:33.960 --> 3:22:41.080]  of material um and and here's what i know about that is these uh systems are now so sophisticated
[3:22:41.080 --> 3:22:47.560]  they program themselves and they program themselves in a way that we cannot unknot it in other words
[3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:55.560]  we can't decode it now we got machines out thinking us in that dimension in the material dimension
[3:22:55.560 --> 3:23:05.400]  this is really important because these systems that can develop thinking without a soul is not
[3:23:05.960 --> 3:23:14.200]  um is not a a fair representation of a living soul okay so this is what's happening you got the
[3:23:14.200 --> 3:23:23.720]  synthetic technologies being created and why because some and i heard those uh quotes from uh
[3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:29.960]  soros that uh alex played a few weeks back and what was important is they don't believe
[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:38.360]  in the non-material spiritual so this is all there is for so many and so their fear level is
[3:23:38.360 --> 3:23:44.360]  extreme because the carrier the body they're occupying they think that's it and when it goes
[3:23:44.360 --> 3:23:50.440]  they go so they're trying to preserve that what they think is that essence by lock it into some
[3:23:50.440 --> 3:23:56.760]  computer program or creating an ai shell that will encapsulate you in some form that will give you
[3:23:56.760 --> 3:24:01.640]  a new carrier in some form right because that's really what they're talking about they're talking
[3:24:01.640 --> 3:24:06.600]  about catching the ether with your hand right i mean come on this is not the way it works but
[3:24:06.600 --> 3:24:13.240]  this is what's happening but the illusion and the ability to create illusion with this technology
[3:24:13.240 --> 3:24:19.000]  is pretty dramatic now i want to take take this another layer and for those of us that can go
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:25.320]  back far enough we remember the xerox machine you know we didn't call them copy machines we call them
[3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:30.440]  xerox because xerox was a company that evolved it we thought how weird is that you put your hand
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:34.760]  on this thing it'll make copy of it you know and start thinking about it now in this century we've
[3:24:34.760 --> 3:24:42.840]  begun three-dimensional printing okay now what are they anticipating three-dimensional printing
[3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:51.080]  we'll get you everything from a new liver coded to your dna to a house complete with the plumbing
[3:24:51.080 --> 3:24:58.040]  and electrical how would that happen let me give you a concept that's coming when you merge these
[3:24:58.040 --> 3:25:06.280]  technologies then you have devices that can take the basic elements recombine them and recreate
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:12.360]  a product an outcome taking it from an elemental level all the way to the finish line and that's
[3:25:12.360 --> 3:25:17.800]  what you're going to see it's coming it's going to it's going to be here you know as i'm as i'm
[3:25:17.800 --> 3:25:21.240]  watching the images and those that can see i'm you know you look at all the funny faces of stuff
[3:25:21.240 --> 3:25:27.560]  you did with for the coffee machine now imagine imagine being able to code your biological
[3:25:27.560 --> 3:25:32.840]  information and then produce a liver because you drank too much and now you get a new one
[3:25:32.840 --> 3:25:36.920]  is that a good idea or bad i don't know drinking too much to ruin your liver is probably a bad
[3:25:36.920 --> 3:25:42.120]  idea in fact i would say it is but you know the idea that you could regenerate something that
[3:25:42.120 --> 3:25:48.360]  your body wouldn't reject now that's pretty heavy duty and that's the threshold that we're
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:55.080]  we're really on a threshold that divides you the material or recognizes what we already are
[3:25:55.720 --> 3:26:01.240]  and and this is the thing this is the struggle of the 21st century is either to come back
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:09.000]  into what we are or to be um synthesized and herded like animals uh into a different way of
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:13.480]  being and i don't think that's what the human being is about and here's what's happening right
[3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:22.280]  now you see um the unrest the uh tension building okay now there's a reason for all of it a lot of
[3:26:22.280 --> 3:26:29.240]  us being deliberately done because trauma is the way you change fundamental character of culture
[3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:37.320]  dramatically you know that's how it happens so we're in the trauma we're in the drama
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:43.800]  trauma and it's unfolding before us and we can decide how we're going to perceive it how we're
[3:26:43.800 --> 3:26:49.160]  going to interact with it we don't have to be carried in the wave we can stand still enough
[3:26:49.160 --> 3:26:54.520]  to see it and then reframe it and then come into it a different way and this is how i'm
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:26:58.920]  suggesting what i'm suggesting and i've said it a lot of different ways over over the years
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:03.880]  but coming into our power is about knowing things i was in a really heavy duty discussion
[3:27:03.880 --> 3:27:11.640]  um with jacob what of our children this week about the idea of creating consciously doing
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:18.520]  things deliberately not just being carried along by everybody's propaganda but thinking
[3:27:18.520 --> 3:27:24.200]  carefully about what you're doing and then how to make that into something and here's and i was
[3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:29.640]  explaining to him this concept that he hears in school all the time which is do the impossible
[3:27:29.640 --> 3:27:34.760]  and i've said it here don't do what's impossible because your brain knows better you can't do
[3:27:34.760 --> 3:27:41.560]  what's possible this is the essence of faith this is the power that we all need to take back
[3:27:42.680 --> 3:27:50.360]  right now the power to decide the power to choose the power to decide how we see the world
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:59.480]  is ours when we let the negative emotions take us that's theirs that's what is material what
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:05.480]  is the body saying oh no i'm so afraid of dying that's your carrier talking to you i get that it's
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:13.080]  important messaging but don't let it run your awareness run your consciousness this hands
[3:28:13.080 --> 3:28:19.560]  your power to others this gives up who you are this gives up your birthright this diminishes
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:26.840]  you as a created human being in the image and likeness of what god is that doesn't have to
[3:28:26.840 --> 3:28:34.760]  do with the shell okay you show me god in a shell well that isn't it it's the essence of us that
[3:28:34.760 --> 3:28:41.800]  connects us to consciousness and everyone else when we can separate and see it and this is what
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:49.240]  is working against us right now is to lock us into a fear mentality that's easily moved because
[3:28:49.240 --> 3:28:54.440]  when you look at the brain and those who've read my work understand this the brain falls into a
[3:28:54.440 --> 3:29:00.120]  flight or fight response which is fine if you're about to be mugged but it is not very good when
[3:29:00.120 --> 3:29:05.080]  you're just being mugged by the technology around you because it's a slow burn it's a slow moving
[3:29:05.080 --> 3:29:09.320]  train wreck it's one that you don't really see happening so it's not the deliberate attack
[3:29:09.320 --> 3:29:14.840]  but the anxiety builds it's designed to do that because they know it shuts off your ability to
[3:29:14.840 --> 3:29:20.280]  reach higher awareness to fall into the gifts of the spirit if you live in fear you will never
[3:29:20.280 --> 3:29:28.520]  arrive there remember when the angel arrives the first words out of an angel's mouth are fear not
[3:29:29.960 --> 3:29:38.920]  why is that because fear is what runs against you it is what evil brings in your direction it's what
[3:29:38.920 --> 3:29:44.920]  the flight or fight response the primitive man within you reacts to this is not who we are
[3:29:44.920 --> 3:29:52.920]  are part of it but it's only the first layer of the bricks in the foundation of our possibilities
[3:29:53.720 --> 3:30:00.200]  is to recognize who we are foundationally begin to analyze that a little bit begin to project
[3:30:00.200 --> 3:30:06.280]  differently in the world deliberately with intention coupled with emotion with intellect
[3:30:06.280 --> 3:30:11.720]  and knowing that's the essence of faith that's when mountains get moved that's when we together
[3:30:11.720 --> 3:30:18.200]  change the world that's when you become the active tip of the spear in the info wars this is Dr
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:21.960]  nick baggage we're rolling into the break we're going to be coming into the last segment of the
[3:30:21.960 --> 3:30:28.520]  day and as i think about going into the weekend this year going into the election season this year
[3:30:28.520 --> 3:30:36.200]  as we focus on that let us hold up in prayer for a few moments that god will select the leaders
[3:30:36.200 --> 3:30:42.200]  and that we will find our freedom
[3:31:06.680 --> 3:31:12.760]  or prophecy giving governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell
[3:31:12.760 --> 3:31:18.280]  to track everything we do it's not just a recipe it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you
[3:31:18.280 --> 3:31:24.440]  look at bill gates you look at bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we should decide
[3:31:24.440 --> 3:31:29.720]  how much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're technocrats we know
[3:31:29.720 --> 3:31:34.440]  best we're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you you snap
[3:31:34.440 --> 3:31:40.120]  your fingers we're here they're just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying with it it's
[3:31:40.120 --> 3:31:46.760]  insane this is your last chance to get a pack power stack and i'm really bummed out about that
[3:31:46.760 --> 3:31:51.160]  it started out as a sleeper product but the people that did order it loved it and started
[3:31:51.160 --> 3:31:55.880]  reordering it they spread the word and became one of our best sellers but because of the covid
[3:31:55.880 --> 3:32:01.080]  supply chain breakdown and because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack we are
[3:32:01.080 --> 3:32:08.040]  unable to secure it anymore this is the highest in ampm pack system you're going to find where you
[3:32:08.040 --> 3:32:12.200]  take half the pills in the morning half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night it's
[3:32:12.200 --> 3:32:16.520]  amazing i don't have time to go into everything that's in it but this gets people to remember to
[3:32:16.520 --> 3:32:20.440]  take it and that's why it's having such a great effect because the stuff in here is absolutely
[3:32:20.440 --> 3:32:25.480]  amazing so it's your last chance you can get a power stack at infowarestore.com it's 60% off

[3:32:50.760 --> 3:32:58.600]  which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that 200 million people have died
[3:32:58.600 --> 3:33:05.800]  probably by the time i finish this talk joe biden has always been a congenital liar part of the
[3:33:05.800 --> 3:33:14.040]  establishment for close to 50 years but now boy his brain degenerates we are seeing walking public
[3:33:14.040 --> 3:33:20.360]  dementia on the biggest stage of the world the 2020 election there are 370 million people in
[3:33:20.360 --> 3:33:26.200]  the united states if 200 million died from covid that'd be more than half of the population
[3:33:26.200 --> 3:33:31.480]  when not even one tenth of one percent have actually died but him putting these giant lies
[3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:36.600]  and these incredibly brain damage statements out is emblematic of the general public being in a
[3:33:36.600 --> 3:33:45.800]  trance how is anyone even putting up with this it is beyond bizarre 2020 election center dot com

[3:34:17.560 --> 3:34:22.200]  trump has finally figured this out since he's going to take action once re-elected against big
[3:34:22.200 --> 3:34:25.640]  tech and then he's modern in the situation well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so
[3:34:25.640 --> 3:34:30.280]  we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action we the people are taking action

[3:35:25.480 --> 3:35:31.480]  up on our mailing list we don't do very much mailing but in time to time we get something out
[3:35:31.480 --> 3:35:37.720]  you know talking again about sort of this sort of backdrop you know that continues to try and
[3:35:37.720 --> 3:35:45.880]  just suck our energy you know out of us it's so much of it it really does and it's and it is intended
[3:35:45.880 --> 3:35:52.120]  in part to do that i mean if you're so occupied and so fatigued you're much more easy to manipulate
[3:35:52.120 --> 3:35:57.720]  this is part of the strategy of the 21st century i got to tell you is here's how it here's how it
[3:35:57.720 --> 3:36:04.680]  rolls up is you come back from work you're you're tired you've done your hour or two commute in a
[3:36:04.680 --> 3:36:09.160]  lot of parts of the country we don't have such a horror show on that up here but we i know that
[3:36:10.280 --> 3:36:16.040]  that that program so you end up with a 12 13 hour day by the time you make the rounds get back and
[3:36:16.040 --> 3:36:22.280]  you you're finally decompressing and then you're back in the cycle again and you really don't get
[3:36:22.280 --> 3:36:29.560]  a chance um to fully reflect and that's what i'm i'm trying to trigger a little bit of you know in
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:34.680]  the course of doing this program we're trying to trigger a little bit of self reflection not for
[3:36:34.680 --> 3:36:41.480]  selfish purposes but for honest evaluation okay because we're the best evaluators are of our
[3:36:41.480 --> 3:36:48.760]  lives and we're also the harshest critics of our lives and and knowing uh super achievers and i know
[3:36:48.760 --> 3:36:53.320]  a lot of them you know i'd say alex is one of the most of the team that i've met at info wars
[3:36:53.880 --> 3:36:59.080]  these are them okay they're over achievers they do a lot and they do it with a lot of joy and they
[3:36:59.080 --> 3:37:03.880]  do it in the zone that they're in because it's like breathing you know when you're doing what you love
[3:37:03.880 --> 3:37:10.520]  when you're doing your passion when you're doing that but having said that you also need to breathe
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:17.160]  a little bit you need the breath of life to rejuvenate you to build you back up to connect
[3:37:17.160 --> 3:37:24.440]  you with others in a different way so um i really want to encourage people that are that are over
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:31.240]  achievers to remember that um we need to suck a little of that energy back for ourselves to make
[3:37:31.240 --> 3:37:36.760]  sure when the moment calls where you need that burst it's available otherwise we wear ourselves
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:43.560]  down and my oldest son came up with a concept and he thought about the con the concept of the compound
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:49.880]  value of experience you know like the compound interest is the way he was doing it it occurred
[3:37:49.880 --> 3:37:55.000]  to him in a business class when you think about compound isn't interest how the funnel gets bigger
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:00.280]  and bigger and bigger the longer you wait well this is your experience in life you see because
[3:38:00.280 --> 3:38:06.040]  the more you gather the more powerful your experience the more you put in the brain in
[3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:11.320]  terms of information how you collect it and put it in it's in there and what i know about the way
[3:38:11.320 --> 3:38:18.120]  the sword works is it's instant okay it can happen instantly that sword and it does on a
[3:38:18.120 --> 3:38:23.720]  subconscious level and comes into consciousness and begins to take part in what we call intuition
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:28.600]  okay and it begins to make make quick decisions out of the right ones well
[3:38:29.480 --> 3:38:34.440]  and then you begin to trust your compound knowledge what you've pulled in and the wisdom that gets
[3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:40.520]  attached to it uh that's a gift and then and then you might be able to do something with all that
[3:38:40.520 --> 3:38:51.160]  knowledge but the the creation process requires calm focus um the balance between uh your emotion
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:57.400]  and your intellect and then your intention which pushes all this into form and see this is what
[3:38:57.400 --> 3:39:06.520]  is being hijacked from us routinely incrementally on the installment plan okay because if you can
[3:39:06.520 --> 3:39:11.800]  just tap everyone every once in a while just keep them anxious nervous uptight stressed
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:18.280]  that's all you need it's the simplest thing of all so when you look at the media coming at you
[3:39:18.280 --> 3:39:24.440]  selling you fear whether it's the ads telling you how bad you smell how bad your teeth are how your
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:29.960]  hair needs to be dyed or whatever aspect of you needs to be thick this is all shell stuff okay
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:34.040]  this is carrier stuff at the end of the day we're all getting old and we're all probably not gonna
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:40.680]  look the same as we did when we were in our 20s I can promise you but here's what is also happening
[3:39:40.680 --> 3:39:47.720]  is our experiences at the end of our life are the most powerful where one step saves a thousand I use
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:55.480]  the phrase a lot so when you work at 90 instead of 110 what you do is you preserve the compound
[3:39:55.480 --> 3:40:01.240]  interest of your life experience so that you are still capable and fit enough to deliver
[3:40:01.240 --> 3:40:08.120]  because long life you know gives you the ability to see it differently gives you the ability to
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:14.680]  see it over a few generations gives you the ability to weave a net that is a better net for your own
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:20.600]  awareness that still allows the garbage to flow through you know and this is it okay so the net
[3:40:20.600 --> 3:40:26.360]  of your consciousness is all the inputs and then the emotional attachment that you hook on to it
[3:40:26.360 --> 3:40:34.920]  coupled with your intention so what I'm giving today is what is used against us because when
[3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:42.680]  you couple that with the vile with the evil it is powerful it is extremely powerful flows that are
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:49.480]  asleep at the wheel of life and most people are and this is my experience but all of us
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:55.480]  have an internal compass and this is what the world does to us as the compass tells us what to do
[3:40:55.480 --> 3:41:01.480]  how to be how to improve it's hyper critical because the world has taught us to fear everybody
[3:41:01.480 --> 3:41:07.960]  else's opinion about us and to not look at our own internal feelings about what we're doing this is
[3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:14.520]  the essence of political correctness to get you to shut up don't say what others don't want to hear
[3:41:14.520 --> 3:41:21.160]  this is not how it works this is not how you create by shutting up that's the first step in
[3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:26.920]  shutting down that's the first step in falling into your flesh as your primary driver this is
[3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:34.360]  the first flesh for enslavement in a body that is not you it's the carrier for the essence that
[3:41:34.360 --> 3:41:41.080]  is you so rethinking sort of this we all know it if you were raised as a christian you know this
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:48.840]  in your head you may not know this in your heart the two have to come in union again this is left
[3:41:48.840 --> 3:41:53.880]  brain right brain is another way to see this this is your emotional side and your intellectual side
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:41:58.600]  this is another way to see this when these come together they form a third thing this is another
[3:41:58.600 --> 3:42:04.920]  way to see this and it's a very powerful thing when these two things come together an IQ goes
[3:42:04.920 --> 3:42:13.480]  infinite because you plug in then what we were intended to do in a way that is very different
[3:42:13.480 --> 3:42:19.640]  the other side of the world would like to keep you in a state of fear and anxiousness here's the
[3:42:19.640 --> 3:42:29.240]  key see look and you'll find the answer don't quit short of the finish line look inside look
[3:42:29.240 --> 3:42:35.800]  outside look around and be aware and pay attention not just the words being said but what they mean
[3:42:35.800 --> 3:42:42.440]  like when i talk about the meaning of do the impossible think about each word do the impossible
[3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:49.800]  they don't work together you know the it's an interesting idea but it doesn't work it doesn't
[3:42:49.800 --> 3:42:54.920]  meet the test of logic you can't do what's impossible here's another one that i heard all
[3:42:54.920 --> 3:43:01.720]  the time and you all remember it from the right to life and abortion debate right and it was you
[3:43:01.720 --> 3:43:07.640]  can't legislate morality you remember that saying you can't legislate morality well what do you think
[3:43:07.640 --> 3:43:15.480]  legislation is but a moral perimeter that's what all legislation is criminal law for instance
[3:43:15.480 --> 3:43:21.800]  is all about morality this is right this is wrong civil law is all about morality you don't cheat
[3:43:21.800 --> 3:43:32.440]  people you don't misuse people okay this is what law is a moral code so when you see these phrases
[3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:38.840]  think about the words do they really belong together do they really make sense or is this
[3:43:38.840 --> 3:43:45.960]  a disconnect method because it is because you begin to accept something that is impossible
[3:43:45.960 --> 3:43:54.440]  to be true what else will you accept that's impossible to be true think again know that
[3:43:54.440 --> 3:44:00.840]  God gave us a brain to use gave us emotions to you gave us the power of choice which is your
[3:44:00.840 --> 3:44:06.360]  intention your power of choice the thing that distinguishes you because you get to choose
[3:44:06.360 --> 3:44:13.720]  how to use your emotion you get to choose how you perceive what you see is it danger
[3:44:13.720 --> 3:44:21.960]  or is it an opportunity you know again um how we see the world shapes our world how we project
[3:44:21.960 --> 3:44:26.360]  into it individually makes a difference and what we do one person at a time is the only thing that
[3:44:26.360 --> 3:44:34.280]  matters all of the rest is a backdrop for moving a herd and we are not a herd we are living individual
[3:44:34.280 --> 3:44:40.120]  souls creating the image and likeness of God to do something unique each and every one of us
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:44.680]  we are not alone in this there are no small things go back and hear what i've said on that before
[3:44:45.800 --> 3:44:52.200]  only things that require doing the active faith of the individual acting on what we each know
[3:44:52.200 --> 3:44:57.240]  to be right and true to carry our individual message into the creative reality that affects our
[3:44:57.240 --> 3:45:02.440]  children our friends our neighborhoods and our families and maybe something bigger than that
[3:45:02.440 --> 3:45:08.760]  but i can assure you everything we do with those intentions to change the world in a better way
[3:45:08.760 --> 3:45:16.280]  they matter there are no small things are only those things that we choose to do with our intention
[3:45:16.280 --> 3:45:22.360]  with our emotions with our heart with our soul and the essence of our being this is Dr. Nick Begich
