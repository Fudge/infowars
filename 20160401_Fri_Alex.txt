[00:00.000 --> 00:12.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.760 --> 00:21.200]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.200 --> 00:26.200]  jones ladies and gentlemen it is april fools day and i'm not going to be
[00:26.200 --> 00:30.600]  engaged in any disinformation i'm not going to be engaged in any jokes or
[00:30.600 --> 00:35.760]  tricks i just don't do it it's part of mass mental illness to teach our kids
[00:35.760 --> 00:39.280]  that santa claus is real and the tooth fairy is real and that the federal
[00:39.280 --> 00:43.880]  reserve is a federal and to sit there and have little jokes and deceptions i
[00:43.880 --> 00:47.360]  mean i'm not judging anybody that does it but i'm not doing it like the austin
[00:47.360 --> 00:51.480]  chronicle announcing yesterday that obama's moving to austin texas next
[00:51.480 --> 00:56.440]  year i got scores of phone calls all these people so excited how important
[00:56.440 --> 01:01.520]  they would be once the dear leader came here what a joke and of course it was an
[01:01.520 --> 01:04.800]  april fools joke i haven't even checked to make sure it is i can just tell you
[01:04.800 --> 01:08.280]  this he's gonna stay with all the sickening lobbyist robbing people in
[01:08.280 --> 01:14.120]  dc or new york but first let's go to a powerful report put together by jacari
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.320]  jackson listen to this headline the dea planned to counter cia drug
[01:19.320 --> 01:23.720]  trafficking that's right we've all seen reports about government waste it's kind
[01:23.720 --> 01:26.760]  of like that scene in independent state the guy says what do you think they
[01:26.760 --> 01:31.600]  spend $100 on a hammer $500 on a toilet seat well actually they kind of do do
[01:31.600 --> 01:35.640]  that we've seen the reports from senator tom coburn from oklahoma but one
[01:35.640 --> 01:40.480]  report i want to focus on here today is about the dea plane the cost 86 million
[01:40.480 --> 01:44.360]  dollars to combat drug trafficking in afghanistan now before we talk about
[01:44.360 --> 01:47.840]  everything that's just wrong with that statement in general will focus on the
[01:47.840 --> 01:51.760]  plane this is a 86 million dollar plane that has not even left the ground it's
[01:51.760 --> 01:55.080]  my understanding it's not even in the bunker that they built for it over in
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.120]  afghanistan now the original cost for the plane was 22 million dollars in that
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.440]  bloomed quite a bit the numbers for the plane the mathematics included but are
[02:03.440 --> 02:08.920]  definitely not limited to 8.5 million dollars for parts and also i guess it
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.400]  includes five million dollars in spare engines for the plane also a lavish
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.800]  trips to various countries to conduct research as well as many other things in
[02:17.800 --> 02:21.600]  when you talk about afghanistan in the drug trade you can't overlook the fact
[02:21.600 --> 02:29.360]  that the opium has boomed since american u.s. military intervention in afghanistan
[02:29.360 --> 02:32.960]  it is not my opinion it is not a conspiracy theory it is a documented
[02:32.960 --> 02:37.800]  fact this contradiction the fact that here you have one of the best fighting
[02:37.800 --> 02:43.240]  forces in the world ever mounted and in a sense you watching as this opium is
[02:43.240 --> 02:47.680]  being grown i know it it grinds at your gut how do you deal with it what do you
[02:47.680 --> 02:52.120]  doing about it well frankly this is a part of their culture so while it might
[02:52.120 --> 02:57.120]  grind in my gut it's what they do we provide them security we're providing
[02:57.120 --> 03:00.600]  them resources and we're providing them alternatives and the alternatives are
[03:00.600 --> 03:06.080]  different crops to grow and that's just opium if you look at the larger aspect
[03:06.080 --> 03:10.680]  of american intervention in various parts of the world you also remember the
[03:10.680 --> 03:14.200]  cia cocaine connection and once again people tell you this is a conspiracy
[03:14.200 --> 03:17.560]  theory it never happened i would definitely direct you to if you go to
[03:17.560 --> 03:22.640]  youtube google right now and you type in cia cocaine one of the first clips of
[03:22.640 --> 03:27.440]  pops up is likely going to be a town hall meeting where a la pd detective was
[03:27.440 --> 03:31.040]  talking to the cia director i believe at that time it was dorge and he says i
[03:31.040 --> 03:34.960]  can tell you mr. cia director as a officer in this neighborhood your
[03:34.960 --> 03:40.160]  agency has dealt drugs here for quite some time i am a former los angeles
[03:40.160 --> 03:43.640]  police narcotics detective and i worked south central los angeles and i will
[03:43.640 --> 03:46.640]  tell you director deutsch and the agency has dealt drugs throughout this
[03:46.640 --> 03:53.240]  country for a long time and we'll end with this this is the big enchilada this
[03:53.240 --> 03:58.280]  is probably one of my favorite newscast of all time this is cbs's 60 minutes
[03:58.280 --> 04:03.880]  mike wallace he's talking to the head of the dea he says hold on mr. dea head
[04:03.880 --> 04:08.320]  you're telling me that the cia brought cocaine into this country and the dea
[04:08.320 --> 04:11.960]  head says yes mike i don't know any other way to put it any rational person
[04:11.960 --> 04:14.640]  can see that this is going on
[04:14.640 --> 04:18.680]  we put it this way mike if this is not been approved by dea or an appropriate
[04:18.680 --> 04:21.520]  law enforcement authority in the united states
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.800]  uh... then it's illegal it's called drug trafficking called drug smuggling so what
[04:25.800 --> 04:28.760]  you're saying in effect is the cia broke the law
[04:28.760 --> 04:30.520]  simple as that
[04:30.520 --> 04:34.560]  i don't think there's any other way you can rationalize around it
[04:34.560 --> 04:38.840]  assuming as i think we can that there was some knowledge on the part of cia
[04:38.840 --> 04:44.240]  at least some participation uh... in approving or condoning this to be done
[04:44.240 --> 04:47.520]  so there you have it whether they're bringing in the drugs or combating drug
[04:47.520 --> 04:48.520]  trafficking
[04:48.520 --> 04:51.360]  there's no amount of money that is too large to spend from the american
[04:51.360 --> 04:52.360]  taxpayer
[04:52.360 --> 04:57.400]  you can find more reports on info wars dot com

[08:17.320 --> 08:22.760]  okay this is an april fools joke on me
[08:22.760 --> 08:26.840]  because they know that i choose the bumper music and they're constantly
[08:26.840 --> 08:29.640]  i love the cruise sneaking stuff in they want to play
[08:29.640 --> 08:33.720]  and i almost blew a gasket when that music started
[08:33.720 --> 08:38.760]  because this is not the rush limbaugh radio program
[08:38.760 --> 08:43.880]  went back to ohio
[08:43.880 --> 08:47.080]  i was just talking about in the first little segment that i am so tired of
[08:47.080 --> 08:50.200]  april fools jokes they drive me up the wall it's an excuse
[08:50.200 --> 08:54.680]  for disinformation in a world already drowning in it
[08:54.680 --> 09:00.280]  and here we are though that is good a good song and good intro music
[09:00.280 --> 09:03.800]  we will not play that again though we will delete that out of the system
[09:03.800 --> 09:08.840]  because here's the deal i'm my own man i did not want to be put on the radio
[09:08.840 --> 09:13.320]  against rush limbaugh i had a weeknight show here on gcn
[09:13.320 --> 09:20.040]  19 years ago that was very successful three hours at nine to midnight
[09:20.040 --> 09:23.000]  and then they came to me and they said we have a bunch of stations want to pick
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.640]  your show up we want to put you on 11 to 2 against rush limbaugh
[09:27.640 --> 09:31.560]  and i've been successful in this time slot but
[09:31.560 --> 09:36.200]  i'm not trying to be rush limbaugh i'm trying to change the world
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.320]  expose crony capitalism and how it uses socialism communism fascism
[09:41.320 --> 09:45.000]  to control the population i'm trying to expose gmo
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.720]  false flag terrorism globalism world government
[09:49.720 --> 09:54.040]  i have changed talk radio five ten years ago you wouldn't hear
[09:54.040 --> 09:57.960]  any of those hosts talking about the subjects they're talking about
[09:57.960 --> 10:02.520]  if this radio slash tv transmission and info wars dot com
[10:02.520 --> 10:08.040]  hadn't trailblazed so i'm not following rush limbaugh
[10:08.040 --> 10:13.400]  the entire pack of mainline conservative slash neocon
[10:13.400 --> 10:17.640]  and uh liberal fake conservative host they're the ones following me and i'm
[10:17.640 --> 10:21.080]  not saying limbaugh is all those things i'm talking about that entire
[10:21.080 --> 10:26.200]  constellation or grouping of people and i did not mean to start the show talking
[10:26.200 --> 10:33.720]  about the show but uh very funny very funny joke who
[10:33.720 --> 10:39.960]  who who thought of that in there it was a team effort it was a team effort okay
[10:39.960 --> 10:43.080]  cj we love you well thank you i love you guys too
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.600]  the best crew i've ever had and i just have a lot of stuff going on right now
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.280]  good stuff bad stuff family stuff work stuff business stuff
[10:50.280 --> 10:53.880]  life stuff and the whole world's quickening and they're talking about
[10:53.880 --> 10:57.960]  nuclear terror being imminent by isis and obama's priming the pump saying
[10:57.960 --> 11:01.320]  his greatest fear is a mushroom cloud uh over man
[11:01.320 --> 11:04.600]  hatton and they're starting war with china and russia and
[11:04.600 --> 11:10.440]  flooding the west with jihadis and so i'm just in a real serious mode
[11:10.440 --> 11:21.640]  which does mean we should have some fun
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.200]  now we're to begin here with the broadcast on this friday transmission we
[11:26.200 --> 11:31.160]  have cleared the slides of guest so that we can have a good old fashioned
[11:31.160 --> 11:35.720]  open lines this has been customary in talk radio for
[11:35.720 --> 11:40.840]  30 something years on fridays and so we will open the phones up
[11:40.840 --> 11:46.360]  in the first hour for a specific focus discussion
[11:46.360 --> 11:50.280]  for delegates or any quote super delegates that are able to get through
[11:50.280 --> 11:53.800]  on the phone line to specifically give me your view on what's
[11:53.800 --> 11:58.360]  currently happening uh with election 2016 because i have a
[11:58.360 --> 12:04.280]  stack of news carl rove fresh face might be best
[12:04.280 --> 12:07.800]  g.o.p. nominee and you said that on the hu hu at radio show we're going to play
[12:07.800 --> 12:14.120]  the clip coming up so fox cnn msnbc cnbc every channel i watch
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.680]  they've gone from hinting they might try to
[12:18.680 --> 12:25.080]  take the popular vote in ohio they're in cleveland
[12:25.080 --> 12:29.640]  from donald trump to saying that they're going to do it
[12:29.640 --> 12:33.320]  and now carl rove the establishment creature
[12:33.320 --> 12:39.640]  gremlin has come out from the basement uh and is openly saying we need a fresh
[12:39.640 --> 12:43.880]  face which is what obviously roger stone told you months ago they're planning
[12:43.880 --> 12:47.560]  by fresh face they mean the speaker of the house
[12:47.560 --> 12:51.240]  paul ryan is making preparations to be the first
[12:51.240 --> 12:55.480]  appointed without any delegates
[12:56.840 --> 13:00.280]  nominee of the republican party now they've had seven contested
[13:00.280 --> 13:06.360]  republican primaries before seven contested conventions
[13:06.360 --> 13:10.040]  and normally it's when people are neck and neck
[13:10.120 --> 13:13.240]  now a lot of times it's contested to make somebody accept the vice president
[13:13.240 --> 13:15.960]  on their ticket and it gets into all the arcane
[13:15.960 --> 13:21.640]  arcania of that this is the first time out in the open someone is way ahead of
[13:21.640 --> 13:24.040]  everybody and they're openly saying they're going to take it
[13:24.040 --> 13:27.480]  they changed the rules there have been seven contested in history
[13:27.480 --> 13:31.560]  but they changed the rules in 76 to openly steal it but this will be the
[13:31.560 --> 13:36.680]  first time they test this fraud on the people
[13:36.680 --> 13:40.280]  again you have taxpayer money spent in mass you have public interest
[13:40.280 --> 13:44.280]  you have uh the fact that they hold out in false
[13:44.280 --> 13:48.360]  advertising if this is the case if they claim this
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.040]  that your vote does count and that you voted and that there's all this
[13:52.040 --> 13:55.960]  integrity and that you're going to choose your leader so you have to live
[13:55.960 --> 13:59.800]  under this government because after all you elected them
[13:59.800 --> 14:05.400]  just like they go oh the tpp the na u the eu we are merging them all with the
[14:05.400 --> 14:08.520]  atlantic and pacific agreements and you can't see them
[14:08.520 --> 14:12.520]  until we've ratified it and then once we get it it's thousands of pages
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.080]  of nightmare tyranny we couldn't even believe but even if it was good stuff
[14:17.080 --> 14:21.560]  it's being foisted on us without a vote
[14:21.560 --> 14:26.200]  and they just go on television and go on all these different radio shows a lot
[14:26.200 --> 14:30.440]  of the republican shows and act like tpp's a good idea
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.600]  and then the author of it with his wife working for the bushes
[14:34.600 --> 14:37.960]  who claims he's against it the last four years comes out and votes
[14:37.960 --> 14:42.760]  for it for the authority to go ahead with it
[14:43.400 --> 14:48.280]  instead of blocking it and that of course is lying dead
[14:48.920 --> 14:54.920]  so i'm very very upset obviously about this i have a stack of news just like
[14:54.920 --> 14:58.040]  i was this morning watching cable news flipping around to see what they're
[14:58.040 --> 15:01.560]  saying same talking point well actually they don't even have to
[15:01.560 --> 15:07.000]  take those votes even if he gets to 12 36 they may be able to take that because
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.560]  those delegates may just switch in the first vote they're like oh i see
[15:11.560 --> 15:15.720]  yes just like hillary did with bernie
[15:15.960 --> 15:23.000]  and i know i marvel on this and i wring my hands and i get upset
[15:24.120 --> 15:28.360]  but really it's a good thing because they're being forced to be out of the
[15:28.360 --> 15:32.280]  open in front of everybody right now in front of god man
[15:32.280 --> 15:37.240]  and are just flaunting everything we have a hijacked illegitimate
[15:37.240 --> 15:44.840]  government what dc is in reality occupied by foreign corporate
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.680]  interest we had a corporate takeover by fraud and paperwork
[15:48.680 --> 15:51.720]  the same folks that brought you quadrillions and derivatives
[15:51.720 --> 15:56.760]  and credit default swaps and all these other counterfeit instruments
[15:56.760 --> 16:00.760]  the same ones caught jacking the water with all this
[16:00.760 --> 16:04.600]  garbage after they put billion dollar systems in major cities to clean it and
[16:04.600 --> 16:08.520]  all it does is make it dirtier these are the con artists of con artists these
[16:08.520 --> 16:13.400]  are the frauds of frauds using weaponized culture
[16:13.400 --> 16:17.640]  weaponized media to create a nation of children
[16:17.640 --> 16:22.920]  who can't even be criticized who can't even be involved who aren't informed
[16:22.920 --> 16:27.560]  who don't know what planet they're on i mean it is frightening
[16:27.560 --> 16:31.720]  how they have handicapped the minds of much of the american people
[16:31.720 --> 16:37.720]  into a bunch of simmering simpering ninnies who love
[16:37.720 --> 16:41.400]  hearing how they've been abused and and how someone was mean to them or
[16:41.400 --> 16:46.200]  called them the wrong name or oh my gosh they're entitled they deserve
[16:46.200 --> 16:49.720]  everything meanwhile they're being completely ripped off
[16:49.720 --> 16:55.080]  while they follow the pied pipers tune to oblivion
[16:55.080 --> 16:58.840]  but carl rove just comes out we'll play in the next segment
[16:58.840 --> 17:02.840]  and just acts like all of this is completely
[17:02.840 --> 17:06.440]  and totally normal he says oh yeah we just need a fresh face you don't forget
[17:06.440 --> 17:11.560]  elections rnc lays groundwork for nominee who may not be
[17:11.560 --> 17:16.440]  trump republican national committee previs was on fox this morning
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.520]  trump was on there in a in an audio clip saying oh yeah i met with republican
[17:20.520 --> 17:23.080]  leadership it went real well i think we're going to be unified
[17:23.080 --> 17:28.360]  and then previs comes out and makes fun of him on fox news and says no we're not
[17:28.360 --> 17:31.720]  but republican national committee has begun to prepare the public for what
[17:31.720 --> 17:37.240]  could prove to be a nasty convention wow look at the honesty of that headline
[17:37.240 --> 17:41.400]  prepare the public no it's not a nasty convention
[17:41.400 --> 17:48.760]  it's a stolen popular vote a suspension of the election at the party level
[17:48.760 --> 17:53.400]  that's what it is that's what's happening stolen election 2016
[17:53.400 --> 17:59.080]  hijacked election selected election 2016
[17:59.080 --> 18:05.960]  huge or as they say in new york huge rnc lays groundwork for nominee who may
[18:05.960 --> 18:08.360]  not be trump republican national committee has begun to prepare the
[18:08.360 --> 18:13.240]  public for what could be proved to be a nasty convention
[18:13.240 --> 18:15.880]  here's another one getting everybody right in the new york times they explain
[18:15.880 --> 18:19.480]  it in the new york times like it's no big deal it's like again explaining
[18:19.480 --> 18:25.800]  cannibalism or child molestation where it's palatable and okay
[18:25.800 --> 18:29.480]  how votes for trump could become delegates for someone else
[18:29.480 --> 18:33.000]  the rules for how republican delegates are selected which differ in every state
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.360]  could end up turning votes for one candidate and delegates who support
[18:36.360 --> 18:41.080]  another candidate at the convention if they break their pledge to the voters
[18:41.080 --> 18:46.520]  as a delegate pledged but see they're just normalizing just like
[18:46.520 --> 18:50.840]  groober got up on tv last year i guess it was two years ago
[18:50.840 --> 18:55.480]  and said my job is to normalize lying and my lies were chosen by the president
[18:55.480 --> 18:58.840]  as the best lies and everyone's clapping at the university level that's so
[18:58.840 --> 19:01.240]  exciting and our job thank god the american people
[19:01.240 --> 19:03.960]  don't pay attention and are low information or ignorant well should
[19:03.960 --> 19:08.280]  deceive them and they were like wow and that's what this is it's just
[19:08.280 --> 19:11.320]  oh hey by the way we're just going to take it away from you
[19:11.320 --> 19:14.440]  and so this is bigger than them just stealing the popular vote
[19:14.440 --> 19:21.080]  this is how the media gets up there and just normalizes it oh some people are
[19:21.080 --> 19:27.160]  going to be taken to a reeducation camp that's what the army
[19:27.160 --> 19:31.880]  that's what the army for four years in their official manual just says yeah
[19:31.880 --> 19:36.040]  we're building reeducation camps they even use the authoritarian term
[19:36.040 --> 19:39.080]  they just throw out your face and normalize it yeah we just take your vote
[19:39.080 --> 19:42.680]  now and ignore it uh-huh your vote never counted what are you conspiracy theorists

[25:25.480 --> 25:29.640]  a few weeks ago and we we set up a committee uh and and then claim that we
[25:29.640 --> 25:35.160]  control everything that's basically what this is
[25:35.160 --> 25:40.440]  the delegates are pledged to the precinct to the vote that was
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.040]  had in the popular vote they go represented at the party
[25:44.040 --> 25:48.680]  the elections are public and are federally and state authorized and
[25:48.680 --> 25:52.280]  funded you have a private group just like the
[25:52.280 --> 25:55.400]  ap used to run the voter news services for elections
[25:55.400 --> 25:58.760]  got caught in a bunch of hanky panky laws control
[25:58.760 --> 26:03.160]  just like a private media group tallied the national votes oh
[26:03.160 --> 26:07.960]  secretly at some office oh
[26:09.160 --> 26:13.160]  next we're going to hear well voter news services the consortium of the media
[26:13.160 --> 26:18.440]  they actually pick the winners now oh party officials
[26:18.520 --> 26:21.800]  former party officials the democrats and republicans they're the super
[26:21.800 --> 26:27.080]  delegates and they don't have to follow even what the pledge delegates say
[26:27.080 --> 26:31.240]  according to rules you made back in the 70s
[26:31.240 --> 26:34.120]  but now for the first time we're going to try to use
[26:34.120 --> 26:38.360]  oh i mean in 1980 they they threatened reagan and said we're not going to give
[26:38.360 --> 26:41.080]  you all the delegates if you don't put george herbert walker bush on so
[26:41.080 --> 26:45.800]  they kind of did it then it was a big scandal just to have a vp in there
[26:45.800 --> 26:49.080]  now they're saying they're going to ignore whole hog
[26:49.080 --> 26:52.360]  they didn't have the nerve in 1980 to actually take it from reagan
[26:52.360 --> 26:57.960]  but they buffaloed him they bullied him they poked him they prodded him to put
[26:57.960 --> 27:02.920]  herbert walker the former cia director shun of the famous nazi collaborator
[27:02.920 --> 27:05.800]  what is it with nazi collaborators running everything i mean
[27:05.800 --> 27:11.000]  when when does when did the when did the nazis crawl in a hole and finally die
[27:14.200 --> 27:16.760]  it's crazy
[27:17.480 --> 27:21.720]  right martz reporting that in washington 73 percent of voters back sanders 60
[27:21.720 --> 27:26.120]  percent of super delegates back clinton yeah it doesn't matter if you win by
[27:26.120 --> 27:29.480]  73 percent son
[27:29.480 --> 27:33.560]  she's got to get those votes and that's why i thought we'd gotten some big coup
[27:33.560 --> 27:36.440]  in new hampshire i guess we did when our reporters talked to a
[27:36.440 --> 27:39.640]  hillary super delegate from california well-known party official
[27:39.640 --> 27:43.640]  he goes look it doesn't matter if she if she lives in new hampshire
[27:43.640 --> 27:46.840]  we're going to give the delegates to her that's why i'm here it's totally normal
[27:46.840 --> 27:50.200]  we're the party we run everything it's not your vote that counts
[27:50.200 --> 27:56.680]  well hey bartender another beer you done talking to me punk our reporters are
[27:56.680 --> 28:00.520]  like okay thank you very much guys like you bet
[28:00.520 --> 28:06.600]  another beer i run this country now i'm a super delegate
[28:06.600 --> 28:09.800]  it's all part of the arrogance and now they're like yeah we're getting the
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.320]  police ready with armored vehicles to take on the vets and the gun owners and
[28:13.320 --> 28:16.840]  better clangers and the rural groups and people that don't
[28:16.840 --> 28:21.240]  do what we want under agenda 21 that says we can take any property we want
[28:21.240 --> 28:24.520]  yeah took your vote don't take your guns
[28:24.520 --> 28:31.240]  don't take your kids kids belong to us we're in charge now we made a rule
[28:31.240 --> 28:34.600]  love that line and it's based on a lot of true stories actually happened
[28:34.600 --> 28:40.360]  free range with robert deval and uh who's the other guy
[28:40.360 --> 28:43.800]  i don't follow hollywood much tevin costner he had great actor
[28:43.800 --> 28:46.680]  and uh they got the corrupt sheriff everybody that are robbing them of their
[28:46.680 --> 28:49.560]  cattle and just beat their friend to death and they're almost to death they
[28:49.560 --> 28:53.240]  end up killing him and they're in there and they say listen you see these badges
[28:53.240 --> 28:57.640]  here you do what we say and hand those guns over
[28:57.640 --> 29:01.000]  they got shotguns aimed at both of them they go listen buddy we represent the
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.200]  real law what's right not those 10 badges you got on your chest
[29:04.200 --> 29:07.640]  and very very quickly that's where this is all going because let me tell you when
[29:07.640 --> 29:11.400]  they're appointing presidents and they're saying our kids belong to the state
[29:11.400 --> 29:14.440]  and they're going to teach five-year-olds how to give oral sex
[29:14.440 --> 29:17.720]  and they're putting glyphosate in all the water
[29:17.720 --> 29:21.160]  and we're growing tumors like miracle grow
[29:21.160 --> 29:24.360]  we got a problem when our government's flooding us with undocumented
[29:24.360 --> 29:28.520]  jihadis we got a problem our government is not our government but i want to be
[29:28.520 --> 29:32.840]  razor sharp clear on this the low level government people
[29:32.840 --> 29:36.200]  are just minions and most of them don't like what's happening
[29:36.200 --> 29:40.280]  so that's not where the fight is it's the collaborators at the top
[29:40.280 --> 29:43.800]  with the foreign nationals and the operatives this is a
[29:43.800 --> 29:48.760]  literal foreign multinational corporate takeover of america
[29:48.760 --> 29:52.600]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:52.600 --> 29:57.320]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.680 --> 30:04.520]  there's no doubt that our country is in serious
[30:04.520 --> 30:08.920]  trouble right now and if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in
[30:08.920 --> 30:12.760]  this situation well i'll tell you how when the democrats

[33:55.960 --> 34:01.160]  dreaded the locust they still do today the villagers would get
[34:01.160 --> 34:08.520]  their blankets together they'd get their
[34:08.520 --> 34:16.040]  rakes together their households uh tools
[34:16.040 --> 34:22.680]  like sweepers brooms and they would go out and sometimes for days
[34:22.680 --> 34:25.800]  fight the locusts knocking them off of the different plants that they were
[34:25.800 --> 34:28.200]  growing
[34:30.040 --> 34:35.400]  but in a matter of 10 20 minutes a large flock of
[34:35.400 --> 34:38.680]  locust a large swarm of locusts to be technical
[34:38.680 --> 34:42.840]  could destroy a crop and eat it to the ground
[34:42.840 --> 34:46.440]  and they didn't just eat the fruit of the crop they didn't just eat the grain
[34:46.440 --> 34:50.600]  of the crop they would eat the entire plant
[34:50.600 --> 34:54.120]  all the way to the ground and then go into the ground and plant
[34:54.120 --> 35:00.280]  eggs on the roots killing everything in their path turning
[35:00.280 --> 35:04.920]  north africa into the sahara today
[35:06.760 --> 35:10.760]  you add humans with goats to that the fact that goats and sheep also pull up
[35:10.760 --> 35:15.160]  the roots and eat those cows don't they they leave the roots
[35:15.160 --> 35:18.680]  deer don't they leave the roots
[35:18.680 --> 35:23.320]  but goats and sheep they don't and it turned north africa

[35:26.760 --> 35:32.040]  tropical in most areas into the hellish desert it is to say
[35:32.040 --> 35:35.480]  and you ask why am i talking about that well i happen to have an article right

[35:43.320 --> 35:50.280]  in nearly a decade you would think that the locust
[35:50.280 --> 35:55.080]  coming here would not try to reinvent what they'd already done and create
[35:55.080 --> 35:59.080]  higher taxes regulations agenda 21 anti-family
[35:59.080 --> 36:02.520]  operations basic trendiness banning of guns
[36:02.520 --> 36:05.560]  bringing in unskilled labor to drive out their own
[36:05.560 --> 36:10.840]  wages and to bankrupt them but no they don't know all they know is
[36:10.840 --> 36:15.240]  they have eaten the crops to the ground they have laid eggs in the roots
[36:15.240 --> 36:19.880]  and now they're coming and they actually the more conscious ones
[36:19.880 --> 36:24.920]  of every race color and creed brag you will be

[36:32.600 --> 36:36.440]  handgun control incorporated in the austin america statesman front page
[36:36.440 --> 36:40.680]  of metro and state years ago when i smashed a bunch of their anti-gun
[36:40.680 --> 36:43.480]  rallies with fellow texans and beat a bunch of their bills
[36:43.480 --> 36:48.680]  catching the bribery everything i mean we savaged them hard we battled
[36:48.680 --> 36:52.040]  the head of handgun control incorporated in the violence policy center
[36:52.040 --> 36:55.080]  the violence policy center the other representative as well said
[36:55.080 --> 36:58.280]  mr jones can trial he wants we've got your kids
[36:58.280 --> 37:02.680]  in the schools and we will ban guns in america one day
[37:02.680 --> 37:06.280]  and he celebrated the fact that they got our kids and you know what
[37:06.280 --> 37:09.880]  for most of us they do
[37:10.760 --> 37:15.000]  they know their locusts they know they rule us
[37:17.560 --> 37:21.240]  california is prettier than texas so they wanted to stay there it's got nice
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.360]  weather it's it's a great state they destroyed it in most areas
[37:26.360 --> 37:31.160]  and now they're sending their forces in and we've played the clips from project
[37:31.160 --> 37:33.880]  veritas where they have meetings with thousands of people and it's military
[37:33.880 --> 37:36.760]  run they're like our cohorts are here prepared to take over
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.800]  election fraud we will get the ids we will get the welfare we will bring in
[37:41.800 --> 37:45.160]  more ops we will implode we will bring in communism they
[37:45.160 --> 37:49.000]  will submit and play the clips
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.200]  how about the clergy response team clips how about the clips of the young kids
[37:52.200 --> 37:58.120]  in uniform in military parade promising to bring in
[37:58.120 --> 38:00.920]  the takeover
[38:05.160 --> 38:08.920]  you see the truth is the throngs and the forces
[38:08.920 --> 38:13.160]  they don't like wealth they don't like swimming pools they don't like success
[38:13.160 --> 38:17.000]  they want misery because misery loves company
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.000]  and it is an ancient tribal instinct to go in and conquer another group
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.240]  of course the people conquering texas by their shares
[38:27.240 --> 38:31.400]  socialism and ignorance and social justice warrior behavior
[38:31.400 --> 38:34.600]  they will be even further enslaved as well but they're too dumb to know it
[38:34.600 --> 38:38.200]  and all they like is the feeble ancient ancestral
[38:38.200 --> 38:43.640]  dream the vestigial dream of being a noble conquer
[38:43.640 --> 38:49.000]  and they conquer with diabetes and with obesity and with low IQs and with
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.760]  bogging down the hospitals and in bankrupting things before they collapse
[38:52.760 --> 38:57.480]  and dumbing everyone down and destroying language and being social justice warriors
[38:57.480 --> 39:04.520]  and drooling and smelling and and chirping
[39:05.640 --> 39:10.280]  and then they're leaders they're they're sorcerers they're
[39:10.280 --> 39:15.000]  they're witch kings like obama and hillary and michael moore just stand back
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.800]  with hatred of their own throngs saying look at what we have created
[39:19.800 --> 39:24.600]  look at the fall of the last just and then they just spread their wings and
[39:24.600 --> 39:28.920]  just stinking rotten pus just shoots out like a huge
[39:28.920 --> 39:36.040]  torrent across the land of disease and pestilence and evil and ignorance
[39:36.040 --> 39:41.480]  led by all the vandal haters like madow and everyone else
[39:41.480 --> 39:45.080]  they're vanguard just riding america down into the dirt
[39:45.080 --> 39:48.680]  bringing the most unskilled the the most radical jihadists
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.640]  just flooding everything saying don't even check for tb don't even check for hiv
[39:53.640 --> 39:58.360]  don't even check for any type of disease just bring them in
[39:58.360 --> 40:02.280]  bankrupt everything more red tape shut off the power plants
[40:02.280 --> 40:08.040]  ship the jobs overseas bring in the red tape wreck everything but exempt us
[40:08.040 --> 40:12.920]  we rule and they just roar your eyes now
[40:12.920 --> 40:17.320]  yes it's a roar of domination
[40:18.040 --> 40:21.400]  and they are our conquerors they are our kings they are our lords
[40:21.400 --> 40:24.360]  they are better than us
[40:25.880 --> 40:28.680]  they are cancer
[40:28.680 --> 40:32.600]  they are the conqueror death
[40:33.160 --> 40:37.400]  again if cancer had a consciousness
[40:40.600 --> 40:44.920]  it would think it was winning as it took over wouldn't it
[40:44.920 --> 40:48.440]  and this is cancer with a consciousness and a will
[40:48.440 --> 40:55.080]  to hurt and a will to steal and a will to make everyone dependent
[40:55.080 --> 41:01.480]  so that these bloated evil openly demonic people like hillary
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.040]  and her controllers can rule over throngs of desperate
[41:06.040 --> 41:12.760]  hat in hand poisoned culturally brainwashed fools
[41:16.520 --> 41:20.680]  and isn't trump with all of his goofy populism and
[41:20.680 --> 41:25.480]  all the things he does yeah he is kind of the idiocracy candidate you know
[41:25.480 --> 41:28.760]  but like the smartest guy
[41:30.760 --> 41:34.120]  in the ship of fools
[41:36.520 --> 41:41.240]  compared to everything else going on he's the best option
[41:46.520 --> 41:49.400]  they want us poor they've said they want us poor that's the plan and you're
[41:49.400 --> 41:52.040]  seeing the process of wreck on the country and then there's these poor
[41:52.040 --> 41:56.600]  hat in hand desperate people going hillary give me free stuff like obama
[41:56.600 --> 42:01.160]  can i have a house please you better get that for you
[42:01.160 --> 42:04.920]  can't walk so sure baby his real spirit would be like
[42:04.920 --> 42:10.360]  you think i'm gonna give you anything trash and he didn't give her anything
[42:10.360 --> 42:13.400]  it was christian conservatives that gave her a house
[42:13.400 --> 42:20.120]  just as a sign what he gave her was double unemployment
[42:20.120 --> 42:24.600]  what he gave her was a shut down deindustrialized country
[42:27.320 --> 42:30.520]  what he gave her was a system where she has to stay locked up with her kids all
[42:30.520 --> 42:34.280]  day long or she'll get shot
[42:36.040 --> 42:39.800]  what he gave her was a world that devils like him can rule because let me tell
[42:39.800 --> 42:43.400]  you something devils can only rule in hell
[42:43.400 --> 42:47.000]  they can't exist in a heaven can they so they want to turn
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.240]  everything into a world based on fraud and ignorance
[42:51.240 --> 42:55.240]  and foolishness and bondage and servitude
[42:55.240 --> 42:58.920]  and humiliation
[43:01.240 --> 43:04.760]  all right i want to open the phones up because they're openly announcing that
[43:04.760 --> 43:08.200]  they are officially going to not let trump have the nomination
[43:08.200 --> 43:12.200]  to create a self-fulfilling prophecy
[43:12.200 --> 43:16.120]  so that people don't vote for trump because they've already been told it
[43:16.120 --> 43:19.400]  won't count so they're ceremonially you might get
[43:19.400 --> 43:23.800]  to go vote for cruiser casick and they might be acceptable
[43:23.800 --> 43:27.000]  and so then if you elect who they tell you you can
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.640]  you can imagine that you actually voted and had power
[43:31.640 --> 43:34.120]  and they're actually saying that they go you can vote for somebody more
[43:34.120 --> 43:39.880]  acceptable or your vote won't count think about that
[43:39.880 --> 43:43.080]  get your mind around that and then ask what's coming next
[43:43.080 --> 43:47.720]  see once you get to this point of rapid disintegration rapid deterioration
[43:47.720 --> 43:53.560]  rapid rotting once you get to this point
[43:53.560 --> 43:56.200]  it's game over
[43:56.680 --> 44:00.920]  the bottom is falling out right now
[44:00.920 --> 44:04.440]  let's say you're one of those big giant ferris wheels this happened before and
[44:04.440 --> 44:07.720]  it kind of rots underneath it with rust this old paint over it you can't see it's
[44:07.720 --> 44:10.840]  all rusted out and finally somebody's standing in it up there
[44:10.840 --> 44:14.040]  300 feet in the air 400 feet in the air and the bottom falls out and they fall
[44:14.040 --> 44:16.520]  to their death
[44:18.840 --> 44:23.000]  america is up there in this cage and it's all rotten rust
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.360]  and the government and the establishment's jumping up and down for glee
[44:26.360 --> 44:30.600]  hitting the bottom as hard as they can and it's buckling and about to totally
[44:30.600 --> 44:34.440]  fall out from under us and then we don't just fall to the ground and
[44:34.440 --> 44:39.160]  bounce every hell every psycho every control freak
[44:39.160 --> 44:44.040]  every corrupt corporation every sick group jacked into the fraud system
[44:44.040 --> 44:50.600]  is going to be given a red tear day at the park
[44:50.600 --> 44:53.720]  this happens in every system the globals run the last 300 years
[44:53.720 --> 44:57.880]  at 250 the jackabins system all of it
[44:57.880 --> 45:00.920]  they're gonna bring everything down and just
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.720]  we'll be lucky if the lights are on and then out of that
[45:05.720 --> 45:09.800]  the new savior will come a new global imperium
[45:09.800 --> 45:14.040]  of biometrics and total control and who can have kids and who can and
[45:14.040 --> 45:17.320]  hey you're not getting free welfare anymore
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.520]  but you'll have to have government authorization just to live basically
[45:22.520 --> 45:26.040]  and the hard working people will be more than happy to accept it
[45:26.040 --> 45:29.400]  you know their new social score like china has and
[45:29.400 --> 45:33.400]  facebook's brought in facebook goes here's facebook mentions we estimate
[45:33.400 --> 45:36.040]  you'll be able to talk to two three million people any time you want this
[45:36.040 --> 45:39.480]  is like a national tv show we're phasing it in for people with some of the
[45:39.480 --> 45:42.280]  biggest sites when i got it about 300 people had it it's about
[45:42.280 --> 45:46.360]  500 now and then it's like oh but if you talk
[45:46.360 --> 45:51.960]  bad about facebook or zuckerberg or it was just telegraphed down
[45:51.960 --> 45:55.160]  do you want it won't work so i start talking about zuckerberg when he meets
[45:55.160 --> 45:57.800]  with the communist chinese and says he's going to censor everybody and it's in
[45:57.800 --> 46:02.200]  the news and i've got to cover it the coward's die a thousand deaths i want
[46:02.200 --> 46:06.680]  that tool to reach people suddenly it only reaches 200 000
[46:06.680 --> 46:11.320]  then i keep talking about it suddenly reaches 60 000
[46:11.320 --> 46:14.680]  and that's what zuckerberg admits they're bringing in social algorithms
[46:14.680 --> 46:17.880]  where if you talk bad about facebook or the chinese government or obama
[46:17.880 --> 46:22.520]  or whoever you just get steadily shut down people say well then don't use
[46:22.520 --> 46:25.720]  facebook uh guess what i got to hit him with maybe i
[46:25.720 --> 46:29.480]  don't know 60 70 million views on there
[46:29.480 --> 46:33.400]  before they figured out i wasn't going to play ball

[47:22.440 --> 47:25.720]  i'll reach people any way i can
[47:26.280 --> 47:29.240]  but they're trying to shut us down all over the place
[47:29.240 --> 47:33.080]  just know that and that means they're trying to shut you down
[47:33.080 --> 47:36.680]  and they're trying to figure out ways openly in congress to to say you can't
[47:36.680 --> 47:40.120]  have political speech or ideas online like drudge or
[47:40.120 --> 47:44.280]  enforce they're openly saying drudge
[47:44.280 --> 47:47.800]  people go well i don't own the drudge report why do i care if they can start
[47:47.800 --> 47:51.640]  restricting that it means the canary in the coal mine
[47:51.640 --> 47:55.960]  is rolling over and it ain't playing dead
[47:56.760 --> 48:02.920]  it's here folks it's happening it's going down
[48:04.600 --> 48:08.040]  when they steal an election from bernie sanders and
[48:08.040 --> 48:12.200]  Donald trump in front of god and everybody else the sky is the limit
[48:12.200 --> 48:17.560]  and as i said beta test they stole up front with hillary
[48:17.560 --> 48:22.440]  and said yeah the delegates are ours we don't care if you win by 20 points in
[48:22.440 --> 48:26.040]  this state or 14 points in this state we're just going to take them
[48:26.040 --> 48:30.040]  we don't care if you win by 70 points or 78 points in new york
[48:30.040 --> 48:33.480]  i'm going to get the delegates that's in the news today
[48:33.480 --> 48:37.160]  to make you give up and not vote for who you want to
[48:37.160 --> 48:40.040]  because they've already told you that you've been disqualified just like
[48:40.040 --> 48:43.880]  they're now doing with trump the scyop isn't the stealing of it
[48:43.880 --> 48:47.720]  the scyop is telling you they're stealing it so you give up hope
[48:47.720 --> 48:51.800]  no go vote for trump biggest landslide ever make them steal
[48:51.800 --> 48:56.280]  big make them steal naked
[48:56.440 --> 48:59.560]  make them get in the ring
[48:59.880 --> 49:04.120]  because every time we resist every time we take action we just get stronger
[49:04.120 --> 49:07.400]  if we totally give up and lay down they win but if we get involved when they're
[49:07.400 --> 49:09.640]  doing bad things and stand up against them
[49:09.640 --> 49:13.080]  other people get involved other people get angry our strength rises because for
[49:13.080 --> 49:16.840]  every action there's an opposite and equal reaction
[49:17.560 --> 49:22.200]  but we have free will in the universe so we can suspend the rules
[49:22.200 --> 49:26.040]  interdimensionally it's not magic it's mathematics
[49:26.040 --> 49:30.280]  when we have free will and should rise the occasion to be the opposite and
[49:30.280 --> 49:33.160]  equal reaction to tonic and physics and we don't
[49:33.160 --> 49:37.560]  we give reality to these people that's the big secret they don't control

[57:01.160 --> 57:04.600]  folks but this is what they teach is microaggressions
[57:04.600 --> 57:07.960]  is appropriating culture that's why they want safe spaces that are black or
[57:07.960 --> 57:11.080]  hispanic or whatever only this isn't blacks and hispanics in general
[57:11.080 --> 57:15.800]  this is what the government run foundations want

[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.280]  gun them and our media says it's good it's liberal i got an article here where
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.560]  the official paper uh in havana of the government called obama
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:25.480]  uh the uh basically in word light and then said the dumb black man is how it
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.200]  translates because that's what i mean have you ever been to
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.200]  latin america oh i know racism against black
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:40.200]  people's only here i love how dumb the general public is how ignorant man
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.880]  i'm not talking about our audience i mean all these politically correct idiots
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:49.720]  cuban state media negro obama incited rebellion and disorder and the
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:56.120]  headline was don't you understand you dumb black man
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.480]  and again nothing against latin america every culture
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.440]  especially the more primitive and all our cultures have been primitive
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.880]  the more your tribal you'll have one neighborhood
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.920]  of whites in ireland that doesn't like the other neighborhood of whites even
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.040]  if they're all catholic they'll just go kill each other sometimes because
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.240]  that's what people do
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:20.760]  just like you'll have two cats both of them could be white both of them could
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.520]  be black both of them could be spotted or one could be white one could be brown
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:28.680]  one could be cream one could be and they'll get in a big fight out there
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:33.560]  over territory it's what territorial creatures do
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.000]  the difference is as you advance into civilization you make territorialism
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  about your freedoms your liberties your ideas and your right to exercise them
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.600]  and have free association and meet other people like that and have your right
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.680]  to associate with who you want that's not called discrimination
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.280]  and then they conquer the the the cultures and then they make you take this
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.280]  plastic globalist culture on that is pure societal death
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.800]  which is all about obsessing and becoming more tribal than ever
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:05.480]  but about all sorts of mindless stupid things
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.240]  everybody's been asking me at stores you name it what happened to your hands
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.520]  were you crucified or something i told everybody i'm
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:18.200]  deadlifting heavy and was successful that a whole bunch of heavy deadlifting
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.800]  and i just went too long and my hands gave out
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.920]  doing 400 pounds after i'd already done it some and it just
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.040]  you know ripped the skin away it's just a classic injury no big deal
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.600]  and i'm glad that i'm getting calluses like i had back in high school and
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:35.240]  college because i mean i had calluses but they got torn off and
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.400]  i just need to get some straps or something i don't need to be lifting that
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.040]  heavy anyways i don't know what i was doing
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.880]  problem is just so easy to lift 400 you want to be 500
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.000]  in fact that's what i'm gonna do i just as for a stunt
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.440]  i'm gonna shoot for 600 the next four or five months
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.720]  and i'm gonna deadlift 600 pounds you know freeway
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.920]  that's not that much but you know for 235 pounds it's pretty good
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.920]  because i know i can do 500 right now the difference is i just cannot tear my
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.240]  hands apart okay i'm digressing when i come back
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.880]  from break mike dug fill ollie

[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.320]  have been up to this week in their quest to stomp out fascism
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:11.240]  after offending a german jewish immigrant by waving a trump equals
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:15.160]  nazi sign right in his face a bernie sanders supporter told the man he needed
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.680]  to go back to germany further demonstrating the excessive hypocrisy
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.040]  of social justice warriors who are completely intolerant and in this
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:25.800]  case xenophobic to anyone who disagrees with their world views
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.720]  and to counter the violent rhetoric of donald trump a supporter of the never
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.880]  trump movement advertised t-shirts for sale advocating the assassination of
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.720]  donald trump no reports of anyone getting beaten for wearing this shirt yet
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:42.120]  not like immanuel who got jumped at his school for wearing a pro trump t-shirt
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:46.040]  he posted photos of the bloody bathroom and a photo of his tooth that got
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.720]  knocked out during the assault and how did the never trumpers respond
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:54.040]  well they proceeded to mock the boy on twitter just another week in the orwellian

[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.840]  in the councils of government we must guard against
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:13.400]  the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.560]  by the military industrial commonwealth in dallas sexist
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.680]  three shots were fired at president kennedy's motorcade
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:25.240]  in downtown dallas the first report to say that president kennedy has been
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.840]  seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.960]  a new order
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.520]  it was almost as if it were a planned impulse
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.960]  it's just pancake
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:48.360]  either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:03.400]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.160]  hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.960]  guns will be taken no one will be able to be off
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.400]  we can take all of them for many of the police and guard troops it is an
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.640]  uncomfortable job to do this in an american city global governance at last
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.960]  is it one world the central bank is in charge but aren't we all just living
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:29.400]  and dying from what the central banks do and for me give me liberty or give me

[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:08.600]  mike dug fill eva renae uh if you just joined us carl roves announced it
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.480]  previous the head of the republican national
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.560]  committee has announced it its official drudge has the
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:23.800]  headline up there saying april fools uh votes for trump but no delegates
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.240]  we're also announcing that bernie sanders is getting 70 plus percent of the
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.160]  vote but hillary will get the delegates the majority 60 percent
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.400]  uh in fact they're basically saying if he want all of them
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.600]  she'd still get most of them that's just how it works in america
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.040]  because they said so and the new york times is a big article explaining how
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:47.000]  it's totally normal and no big deal just like it's totally normal and no big
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.120]  deal to have the government bringing in hundreds of thousands that's not 10
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.240]  thousand of illegals from the middle east
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.520]  mainly military age men and then giving them fake
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.200]  well they're not fake they're real ides but fake identities social security
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.440]  numbers and putting them in section eight housing
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.000]  same thing in europe that's in the news in germany
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.600]  and then if you criticize it you get arrested well here's two articles just
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.200]  out in the last hour both up on info wars dot com the video white house
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.720]  censors french president shane islamic's terrorism
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.240]  because you're not allowed to say that the government said so
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.200]  three years ago obama told the media don't use it and you know what they
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.120]  follow what he says they use the words he says
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.640]  that's only done in north korea
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:36.680]  and now in the west i mean i'm actually having an anxiety attack on air right
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.520]  now i'm not kidding this is so crazy watching them say
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.480]  they're taking the popular vote away they're appointing
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.680]  presidential candidates now that they're openly saying they're doing it
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.760]  they are every day i see articles in Germany France
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.160]  england where someone will tweet yeah i saw a woman wearing a burger today and
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.080]  i asked her what she thought about the
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:04.120]  bombing and then the police go and arrest him at his house
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:08.200]  well this this is today drudge report dot com is linked to it in the middle
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.840]  column it's a paul joseph watson article and then

[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.760]  for not wanting them to slit little girls throats
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.560]  now i'll say this the average cops in england are listeners and know what's

[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.320]  what is it something like 25 percent of muslims who are citizens polled in
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:24.040]  france said they support suicide bombing and he says it's islamic terror
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.480]  he's the one that brought him in though
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.880]  but he at least says the truth and our own white house
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:38.760]  censors it and they have the person the interpreter just not say it
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.440]  you talk about 30 seconds for midnight not two minutes i mean we are
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.640]  in the belly of the beast folks i'm going to dug in mike here in a second
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.080]  but here's the french president being censored in america imagine
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.680]  american presidents have gone to moscow
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.120]  and like you know like reagan and people and given speeches and it wasn't
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.280]  censored on the live radio they didn't censor christ
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.040]  chef when he came here and beat his shoe at the but man let me tell you it is
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.720]  now because it's okay because obama's black and well michelle you know she
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.760]  tells us what to eat and if your school district doesn't eat what she says
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.360]  they're going to find you thousands of dollars per kid boy we sure live in a
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.040]  free country don't we and it's only going to get worse by the minute until
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.720]  people wake up and break with this stuff
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.960]  let's go to the club here doesn't we also making sure that between europe and
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:31.480]  the united states they can be a very high level coordination
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:39.960]  but we're also well aware that the roots of terrorism
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.240]  and he goes on for a while so so they both cut the audio
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.800]  then she doesn't know what's going on someone's saying something in her ear
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:58.280]  and then she goes back losing ground thanks to the strikes we've been
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.440]  able to launch with the coalition we are
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:07.000]  continuing to support iraq this is also the season we have taken
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.680]  supporting the iraqi government and making sure
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.680]  that's it let's start it over again for folks who are listening on the radio

[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.880]  it did wake up the police and military in the last eight years
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:13.160]  when they started telling them get ready to arrest veterans and gun owners and
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.520]  take them to work camps but that still flew and they're getting ready for it
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.320]  didn't fly entirely it was a big wake-up call but
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.040]  they're still going ahead with the plans and the people clan are not going to
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.720]  execute when the time comes but they'll be false flags so horrible blamed on us

[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.960]  listened to you for many years now i'm only 27 but
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.640]  i've heard you speak a lot to enlightenment
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:13.320]  and so basically what i want is if you can explain what enlightenment is to
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.880]  you and if you can explain the word you had
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.800]  and if possible um if i can speak to you off-air

[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:50.600]  exactly what it is you want to relay to us
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.920]  a lot of people when i do these facebook mentions or i do
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.680]  a special live shows or whatever or i go off into a
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:04.280]  philosophical discussion of the new renaissance the new
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.200]  atlantis the enlightenment
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:15.240]  things like that people then ask well that kind of sounds masonic
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:21.560]  or that kind of sounds um classical rosa crucian
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:26.680]  that sounds like francis bacon what are you getting at are you a mason
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:32.360]  are you into this mystery school stuff in the very discussions i have on that i
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:37.160]  explain that that's who founded america a consortium of christians
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:44.520]  of reformist of a cultist but but but not in a satanic
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.840]  way i know christians will argue and i'm a christian that
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:50.920]  you know all occultism leads to the devil in one way or another well then
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.520]  you know the the jury's out on king solomon
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.520]  this is sophisticated stuff okay the point is i've studied it all
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.720]  and so i'm simply speaking about where this country came from
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:06.520]  and what it is and who the original illuminati
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.040]  were and what they believe they were setting up not the counterfeit
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:16.520]  of adam weishaupt that was countering a enlightenment movement
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.840]  that was launching a new a new phase in 1776 but had been around for over 300
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.000]  years so i judge a tree by the fruits and the
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.440]  people that set up this country are the ones
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:32.120]  that ran through magna carta in 1215 they're the people that
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.320]  created the renaissance there's people that created the guttenberg press
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.520]  there's people that created the reformation there's people that created
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.560]  western civilization and took it from just as barbarous
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.800]  or maybe worse than other cultures into what it is today
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.560]  for all its problems it's the most advanced
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:53.880]  and so you make your own decisions i haven't made all my decisions about it
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:57.640]  myself i'm a christian i love christ
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.320]  but i'm not one of these establishment Pharisee preachers up there
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:05.080]  that is you know pushing this agenda of if you drink a beer you're going to hell
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.200]  and then meanwhile he you know at night he's with a prostitute
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.920]  i'm not one of the Pharisees that christ talked about they said why do you hang
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.120]  out with prostitutes and former tax collectors and people that are the
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.160]  most reviled and he said because they're real people
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:21.000]  and they want to hear the truth and they've repented
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.320]  they're not up praying in public on the hilltop and telling people how pious
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:32.120]  they are and so that's where i come from
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.240]  there was the original form of christianity
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:38.360]  was
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:44.680]  very spiritual very connected to god very enlightened and powerful
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:48.360]  it got taken over by establishment church and turned into what it is today
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.880]  where you go through men you go through priests you go through the system
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.320]  there are counterfeits of any of that original real
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:59.720]  christianity that has become gnostic or
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:04.040]  bled into other systems that's the nature of these deceptions
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:09.160]  but the original thread from christ does come all the way through
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.400]  from jerusalem all the way through into scotland england
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:17.320]  france germany you name it and out of that there was
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:21.880]  groups and organizations that said they wanted to empower humanity
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:26.360]  said they wanted to develop science and technology
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:32.200]  and god's promise of building a heaven on earth
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:35.800]  in a thousand years in the new atlantis
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:43.560]  the new world order though is basically claiming they're that but they're not
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.080]  they want to be god and bring in a new dark age against humanity
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:51.880]  and so when i talk about a new enlightenment and new renaissance i
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.600]  mean real freedom real spread of ideas real debate
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:00.600]  community of humanity out of the renaissance came the abolition movement
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:05.320]  all of it that changed the world so then america and england
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:09.000]  and france and germany the home of the enlightenments
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.960]  we get the blame for all the barbarism in the world
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:16.120]  when it was the enlightenment that turned the tide against it
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:22.120]  so the evil of the modern world blames the engine of human love human
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.600]  empowerment
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:31.160]  the celebration of humanity the celebration of god's creation and of
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.440]  course the creator above it
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.880]  the celebration of this wondrous time together
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:45.000]  the celebration of all the things we're going to discover together
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.840]  i say a philanthropist is a lover of humanity but notice the globalists all
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:52.360]  call themselves philanthropists they're not
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:56.760]  they are would-be enslavers of the engine that is human
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:01.560]  consciousness and human ideas that is made in the image of the creator of the
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.800]  universe look how we create look at what we do
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:11.080]  look at what we build we are fantastical creatures
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.120]  and other humans want to get in groups dumb us down
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:21.240]  and use us like beast of burden because there's also that satanic thrill
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:26.200]  in capturing such a magnificent species and then mutating it and making it ugly
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:29.560]  we will get our hands around your spiritual throats globalist
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.640]  we will cast you down with god's help and we will rise you are not going to stop
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.840]  us and you already know it and it's why you scream with hatred
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:42.920]  it's why you boil with disgusted filthy hate for humanity is because you know
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:47.240]  you've lost and you want to just drag as many people as you can into hell with
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:51.640]  you and i'm sick of all these milk toast
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.640]  fake christians you study the prophets and the bible and christ in there with a
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.480]  bull whip a multi-ended cat or nine tail beating people and
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.320]  kicking tables over and kicking people upside the head the money changers the
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:07.080]  manipulators the false priests the people sitting in front of you and god
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.000]  keeping you from god keeping you from enlightenment keeping you from
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.680]  renaissance keeping you from all that god's given us
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.160]  men and women coming together children our love our communities
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:25.480]  our humanity all that's good god gave us and this system gets up there on tv
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:30.040]  and super imposes itself between man and woman and family how dare them come
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:33.800]  into a jurisdiction they have no jurisdiction in
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.600]  but we've invited the vampires in and now it's time to recognize the vampire is
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.840]  in our bedroom it's in our kitchen it's in our children's rooms
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:46.680]  it's in the schools it's in the banks it's in the air it's in the food
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.640]  it's all around us and just as sure as night
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.640]  follows day and then day follows night
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.600]  all of you that hate humanity and hate strings and hate those that are strong

[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:10.920]  try to convince those of us that are good and pure of art that we're bad
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:14.520]  that we've done something wrong so that we'll kneel to you
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:17.400]  and let you dominate us and use this as a footstool
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.000]  because then you can imagine you've dominated god because you've dominated
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.880]  god's creation made in his image that's why they love giving each other
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:30.600]  medals and awards and power and prancing around on red carpets because
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.640]  they want to pretend they are risen because they are
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:39.080]  fallen they want to pretend they live because they're dead

[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:06.520]  anti-trump supporters have been up to this week in their quest to stomp out
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:10.440]  fascism after offending a german jewish immigrant by waving a
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:14.520]  trump equals nazi sign right in his face a bernie sander's supporter told the
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.680]  man he needed to go back to germany further
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:20.360]  demonstrating the excessive hypocrisy of social justice warriors who are
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.600]  completely intolerant and in this case xenophobic to anyone who disagrees
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:28.040]  with their world views and to counter the violent rhetoric of
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.520]  donald trump a supporter of the never trump movement
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:34.920]  advertised t-shirts for sale advocating the assassination of donald trump no
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:37.720]  reports of anyone getting beaten for wearing this shirt yet
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:42.120]  not like immanuel who got jumped at his school for wearing a pro trump t-shirt
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:46.360]  he posted photos of a bloody bathroom and a photo of his tooth that got knocked
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:49.720]  out during the assault and how did the never trumpers respond
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:52.440]  well they proceeded to mock the boy on twitter
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:56.120]  just another week in the orwellian world of the lefty hypocrisy

[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.200]  robes come out as well and just said yeah we may just appoint somebody who
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:43.560]  doesn't even have one delegate and they're announcing censorship all
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:47.000]  over the world all over the u.s it's pretty clear they're
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.360]  going to let radical muslims in attack us and then say it's our fault they're
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:54.280]  attacking they'll be criticizing and facebook and everybody's
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:58.360]  adopting chinese style censorship i mean this is it's all happening i mean i'm
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:01.960]  sure to tell you it's all happening and then what do you do you're just like
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.560]  okay now they're saying we're gonna appoint people
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:09.880]  and then have a staged election i mean
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:15.480]  what comes next well they're saying they're gonna do bail ins and just start
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:17.960]  taking money out of your bank account and they're getting ready for global
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.320]  collapse i mean it's just crazy
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:25.560]  and i cannot find words to impart how concerned i am
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.200]  and how concerned all the other experts are basically i know you're concerned as
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.040]  well and then you see the general public
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.840]  kind of the trendies in people they don't even know what planet they're on
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:37.000]  what are they going to do during a great depression
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.120]  or a nuke going off in new york like they say you know they're trying to get the
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.280]  public ready for whatever it is they're gearing up for
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.960]  i mean government is digging in worldwide like
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.480]  a 10 mile wide asteroid's coming or something i mean i'm not saying that's
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:53.960]  happening i'm just saying they're scared they're freaked out what is it
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:58.360]  what's going on why are you bringing in millions of radicals
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.800]  why are you targeting gun owners and veterans why do you have death list for
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.000]  veterans oh why why because they're evil folks we're
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.880]  in the hands of very evil people and the media is so lapdog now that the french
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:14.840]  president they cut the audio off had a press conference with the president
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:20.120]  and the media is so controlled it takes a new media to cover it
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:23.640]  i'm telling you folks they could take me and arrest me and take me into a
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.440]  fema camp and msnbc would probably report on it and say it was a good thing
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:31.480]  remember when they said oh the of course we're persecuting the tea party and
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.000]  veterans groups and christian groups of course we're not giving you 501c3
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.800]  or taking them and of course we're coming after you you're racist you deserve it
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:43.000]  you're dehumanized
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.360]  and these people give vent to every evil instinct they've got now black white
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:49.880]  doesn't matter like this video black student assaults white hippie
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:54.280]  for appropriating dreadlocks close quote and it's some
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:58.200]  white chicken neck who has who has submitted

[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.840]  and file a complaint on the people they attacked perfect
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.160]  perfect social justice warrior logic where everything's about blaming you
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.040]  everything's about twisting everything against you and it's not just
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:39.000]  with the social justice warriors at the colleges and the public schools
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.920]  the general public's adopting it now everything's a blame game everything's
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:46.360]  twist what you've done everything is just mental illness and insanity all over

[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:57.160]  go under the strong cities you and initiative let them run them as social
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:01.320]  justice warriors and then the hits will be removed but forget the mexican
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:04.360]  drug cartels threatening to kill cops if they don't roll over that goes on in
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:08.440]  the southwest literally soros the democrats the justice department are

[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:25.720]  that the cops deserve to die then idiots go and do it so you don't even have to
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:29.160]  give them the order to go kill the cops and a lot of police departments are
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.760]  rolling over and saying okay we submit we'll go out for gun owners and
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.400]  veterans and patriots we will now be tools of basically
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.440]  howl sharpton and barack obama and hillary clinton
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.720]  this is how it works and now the u.m will come into every city including austin

[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:14.680]  giant cess pits of mental illness eva in texas thanks for holding them renee
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:19.000]  and others you're on the air it is very nice to meet you mr
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.160]  jones i've been trying to get a hold of you for
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:26.440]  more than a year now first off i want to say
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:30.440]  god bless you your entire staff all the info warriors and all the listeners
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:35.640]  god bless you ma'am what i wanted to discuss first of all
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:39.400]  a little bit of background about me i'll tell you about the liberal media and
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:45.320]  donald trump i'm a fourth generation that came from
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:50.120]  spain i have blonde hair blue eyes i work in the medical
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:53.080]  field i'm a nursing assistant i see people all the time i have a lot of
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.480]  family i'm in a border city here in texas and one of the biggest things that
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:03.080]  upsets me is the whole lie that the media says
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:07.400]  that all hispanics hate donald trump it's baloney
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:12.200]  okay you remember when obama rolled out the open borders
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:19.000]  univision once upon a time used to be exactly like abc they used to give
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.480]  different kind of news but it's all liberal but the moment obama
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:29.240]  rolled out the open borders univision changed to basically what i call them
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:33.000]  the illegal immigration channel 90 percent
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.320]  other news i'm not joking 90 percent i know it is a coordination to bring in
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:40.120]  the north american union breakdown borders and consolidate
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:43.560]  canada mexico in the u.s. it's admitted they coordinated at the
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:46.040]  white house robert rodriguez is at the meetings
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.640]  actually getting government money to put out his tv channel
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.320]  it is all race-based and of course 70 something percent depending on the
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:56.840]  gallup poll 67 to 70 percent of hispanic americans don't want open
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:59.960]  borders they're not stupid mexicans in mexico don't want to open border with
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.200]  guatemala they're not stupid but they run this giant hoax that all hispanics
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.640]  won open borders or all hispanics hate trump and then when he got record
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.920]  numbers of hispanics to vote for him in the primary
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.200]  against the other candidates that really freaked him out even more so
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:18.920]  absolutely they are trying to totally balkanize this country
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:22.280]  you're absolutely right mr johnson and the thing about it is is that
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:26.280]  every single hispanic i talked to the older ones that went to the proper
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:29.480]  channels and legally became a u.s. citizen
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.800]  they're against the illegal immigration they are appalled that you have this
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:37.080]  group of people that snap of a finger they want
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:40.760]  benefits they want this they don't want to learn they don't want to learn the
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:44.280]  way we live here you know they think that the way the world is
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.040]  over there across mexico it's the same thing here
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.200]  well that's that i mean mexico in many levels has collapsed culturally so are
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:55.000]  we that's what the industrial age is one of the byproducts of it it's had some
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.480]  positive things but also some very negative things we're in a whole new
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.760]  environment now mexico has collapsed into a very
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:05.320]  evil drug dealing globalist murdering thug level thing
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:08.040]  that's now been adopted by a lot of the young people
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.800]  and so they're getting here being indoctrinated into new uh group think
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:15.080]  gang think with the democratic party the socialists and others
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:18.520]  but i'll say the illegal immigrants of this country
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.320]  on average are nothing compared to
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:27.000]  freeborn americans of every race color and creed that have been through the
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.120]  educational system that watch 10 hours of tv a day
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:33.960]  and that are trendy they are the laziest stupidest
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.840]  weirdest most hateful people you could imagine the most entitled
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:41.400]  so at the end of the day they're just bringing in all the illegals to drive
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.880]  down wages and bankrupt everybody and bankrupt all those poor millennials
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.840]  and so maybe they deserve to be bankrupted they're so evil
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:53.640]  you know i mean i'll be honest with you uh it's the larger globalism of having
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:57.960]  no laws and no borders is the end game of world government so that's why i'm
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:02.120]  against it but i do hear your points and and the polls show it
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:06.120]  and it's so sad it's so sad to know that mecha and la raza
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:09.400]  are race-based groups that say for those in the race everything those outside the
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:12.280]  race nothing and that they're fine about the ford
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:15.560]  foundation roger foward foundation others you know i said this hour i'd get
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.320]  into the whole cia media control and i haven't done it yet i'll do it at
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.440]  the bottom of the next hour i promise or nico can come in here and punch me in
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.560]  the nose he doesn't want to but i need to be made to do these things it's so
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:30.520]  important because what's happening is the great
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:33.640]  uncloaking is happening hey yeah we're gonna appoint the president
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:35.960]  yeah we're gonna forcibly inoculate you yeah
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:40.360]  federal reserve is private yeah we do run things yeah if we did put fluoride in
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:44.200]  the water to brain damage it mm-hmm yeah garter still does uh attack your
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.280]  ovaries mm-hmm what you're gonna do about it
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.600]  you see they tried to hide all this but now we we won the war you won the war
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:56.440]  exposing it so they go okay yeah we want world government
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:00.680]  mm-hmm and uh we're gonna run your life and we're
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:04.120]  gonna do this in the i mean it's so sad it's so sad
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:09.000]  that we're going into bondage i grieve for what's happening
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.560]  i grieve but here's the problem and it's also the answer
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:23.000]  carl martz when he wrote the communist manifesto and of course when he wrote
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.480]  multiple books on the whole system of communism and practice
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:31.960]  said that once they built a giant industrial state
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.920]  that the state would wither away because there would just be people owning
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:37.880]  these giant factories we all have spaceships and great medicine and live
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:40.040]  forever but that's not what was ever meant to
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:43.560]  happen and he was just copying what the enlightenment and the
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:46.920]  Renaissance folks had been saying hundreds of years before
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:51.000]  they'd actually just about delivered most of it the medicine the longer life
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.160]  the the indoor plumbing you know aircraft all of it
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.280]  they were delivering all of it through renaissance
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:03.960]  free association so he comes in hijacks all that the robber barons
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:08.680]  financed it to bring in a monopoly over the serfs that's built
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:13.240]  as for the people it's it's feudalism and slavery repackaged
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:16.440]  but it's true that once you get a big enough industrial age and then they
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.600]  make widgets the new social trinket the bobble that you've got
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.720]  to have the iphone the you know whatever the case may
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:27.960]  be the video game console then once you have that
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:30.520]  you don't care if you don't have enough money to have kids you don't care that
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.000]  you can't have kids you don't know why nobody can have kids
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.040]  you don't know why you seem to swim in your mind all day
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.160]  from all the toxins and brain damage and the drugs you take
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.720]  and then you just kind of give up and don't exist and they're just brushing
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:46.920]  you aside it's a high-tech cultural nerve gas they spray it spray on us
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:49.400]  basically that in the aggregate soft kills us in
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.920]  Texas out of the game they stun us like an electric eel will shock
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.240]  its prey and then eat it we've been shocked we're kind of
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:02.600]  and then they're coming in for the kill here folks and i'm like hey wake up
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.280]  hey look man i tell you when the public
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.920]  finally opens their eyes it's starting to happen for a lot of people and you're
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:13.320]  like whoa you got evil globalist all around you
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.200]  then people go oh my gosh alex is worse than you said i i know i know i understand
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:21.160]  but hey we're in the animating contest of liberty we're not being negative
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:24.600]  there's ways to turn this around and change it we can do it
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.200]  but we're going to have to go outside more we're going to have to plant gardens
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:31.080]  we're going to have to pray we're going to have to break with the system
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:34.440]  and that means getting outside the system going outside
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.960]  looking at the stars hugging our families forgiving our enemies
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:40.520]  uh who aren't globalist i mean you know dumb enemies on the ground that are
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:43.000]  stupid most people that attack you aren't attacking
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.200]  you because they're actually evil at the low level they're they're scared
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.880]  they're envious they're they're insecure they're they're following false
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:53.240]  paradigms in their minds they're they're projecting things on to you
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.040]  you're projecting things on to them out of our own fears
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:01.560]  but if we saw the enemy attacking us which is right there we're uncloking it
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:04.840]  they're uncloking then we would drop our differences
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:07.480]  and realize man this is really horrible what's happening
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:12.600]  i want to go to renae ollie john phil and others uh in fact phil has been

[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.440]  well i'm calling because the city of rapid city has started tearing down my
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.800]  house in the name of the asbestos um the thing is is that 60 percent of the
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.160]  houses in rapid city have the same sighting on it they've been
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.280]  targeting me for a long time through code enforcement
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.800]  because i've been pointing out problems within the city government and
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.080]  everything else the whole thing the whole asbestos thing is a scam on average
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.840]  if they seal it with sealants then it's not a problem it's the removal of it
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:54.200]  that puts you into the entire environment

[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.160]  it is using global standardized code enforcement to make

[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:37.240]  while selectively giving waivers to globalist operations so that they can
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:42.200]  thrive it's feudalism it's serfdom it's the ultimate form
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:47.400]  of discrimination and that's what's going on the way you bring them down
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:51.400]  is you go and show city-owned buildings or things that have asbestos that
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:54.280]  haven't done it yet you embarrass them they'll move on to a

[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:24.520]  of a total scientific dictatorship called a worldwide planetary
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:27.800]  technocracy buys a big to brzezinski and all the
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:34.280]  top globalists since the 60s their published books
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:37.880]  the technotronic era and others brzezinski admits that the government
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:43.000]  runs the the sex rings the drug rings everything
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.200]  i remember being four years old and my dad reading the technotronic era
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.640]  and he goes this is incredible they taught us this in plan two at ut
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:53.480]  supposed to be classified i mean my dad was at ut when he was in high school
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:58.680]  in whatever program that was yeah and that's why i do it like a whole world
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:01.560]  government the whole deal when i was a kid my dad explained it all to me
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:06.440]  they were teaching him that and all the other top students from texas
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:10.440]  the texas program at the time was it was really a state college then they'd
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.920]  call them in and tell them when they were juniors in high school we're bringing
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:16.360]  in world government we're doing this and that
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.520]  and i remember being like four or five years old my dad at the dinner table
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:23.560]  reading the technotronic era and going son listen to this this is one of the
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:27.080]  top strategists the national security advisor he was in office then talking
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:29.880]  about how the government runs the narcotics and runs the sex trade and
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:33.400]  runs everything that way they control it son you see
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:36.600]  none of the stuff you see on the news about criminals and drug dealers is real
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:40.840]  the government is run by big mega banks they bring in all the drugs
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.520]  and they write books telling you they do
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:48.920]  that's how dumb they think we are and then he talked about the future what
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:52.120]  they would do and how they'd end the family and everything else
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:55.960]  and now we're here we're just we're just going over the edge into hell on earth
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:59.160]  i'm gonna go back to rene and then greg and and ollie and phil let me get to all
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:02.440]  of you i want to give each caller plenty of time
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:06.360]  just realize it's so sophisticated but then once you understand it's an attack
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.320]  once you understand it's not being done for your own good
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:12.760]  the people at the grassroots the judges the cops the lawyers
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:15.880]  they'll go all the system doesn't work too good but it means well and we're
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:18.920]  helping people and because they're not bad people themselves but
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:22.680]  it's all done to end the country and end the world as we know it
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:27.320]  and that's a fact and it's unconstitutional
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:31.400]  because our founders had already faced earlier forms of oppression and
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:34.680]  manipulation under the british empire which was the best
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:40.440]  a manipulative system at that time the softest tyranny
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:44.040]  so they tried to build something that would have escape hatches from what
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:47.400]  they dealt with oh let's just throw this aside and see
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:50.520]  what happens now look how fast we're going downhill
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:55.640]  right now the censorship the control the out in the openness
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:59.400]  they want to normalize it for the next phase and folks the next phase
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:05.480]  is going to be i mean i'm i shudder at my gut level
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:08.440]  renae go ahead and quickly tell folks what they've been doing to you there in
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:12.200]  south dakota well um they're just trying to steal my
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:16.600]  house basically it's just another form of the city government they stole a car

[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:46.040]  these people
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:51.640]  let's go to ollie in new york and then greg and everybody else holly thanks for
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:55.720]  holding go ahead you're on here oh hi how you doing alex i'm all right
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:59.240]  welcome uh so i just want to say that
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:04.040]  being a practicing sunni muslim i have a lot of support for donald
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:06.920]  trump you know people they may call me racist they may call
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:11.560]  like i got that a lot but you know it's true it's true like
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:15.240]  america has a lot of problems and the establishment is not going to help it's
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:18.280]  going to be donald trump who's going to come to the rescue
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:22.840]  all right well let me just say this something a point i don't make when i
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:25.880]  go on these rants i've known a lot of muslims a lot of muslim friends high
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:30.600]  school college still have friends uh and uh some of them i've talked to
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:33.160]  off air kind of scared to even have dinner with me because they know i'm so
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:36.760]  heavily surveilled it's not wrong to meet with somebody that's a muslim
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:40.600]  i know that this that the sunnis are 79 of us alone i know there's a lot of
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:44.760]  really diverse groups syrian girl like a model super smarter than i am
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:49.080]  great lady she's a sunni and it's against what the invading
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:53.320]  Saudi arabian back well hobbyists are doing so i know sunnis are a very diverse
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:56.600]  group that's why i say it's radical islam my issue is
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:00.200]  they're funding radical islam to take over islam to attack the west
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:03.080]  to then crush muslims everywhere and that's wrong
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:06.520]  so i'm a great friend of muslims i was against the iraq war all of it
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.880]  but these horrible radical islamists that are arrogant
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:14.280]  merged with the left are very very dangerous and that's why
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:19.320]  even lewis farrakhan who's kind of an american you know style muslim christian
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:22.200]  slash muslim whatever you want to call it kind of a
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:27.320]  abrahamic muslim i'd call it he is saying we've got to stop people coming in
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:30.440]  until we vet them because that's going to be used to scapegoat all the muslims
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:33.000]  do you agree with that statement
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.080]  do you know like being in new york i'm sort of scared to tell people that i
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:41.960]  support donald trump because you know they always like i'm just afraid of the
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:46.200]  backlash that gets out of that like oh what about what about
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:49.400]  what about your friends and family uh because america is one of the most
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.680]  tolerant open countries in the world you think donald trump wants to kill the
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:56.600]  average muslim when meanwhile saudi arabia chops the heads of gay muslims
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:00.680]  off um well like growing friends and family
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.720]  like when i talk to my when i talk to like my mom or dad they'll
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:07.080]  they'll tell me oh we're gonna vote for heli but i tell them why they're like
[02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:10.920]  oh because they're husbands but i just look at them i'm like
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:14.440]  like you guys you know the establishment have
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:17.800]  brainwashed you guys into believing that
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:23.240]  heli is a good person or or any of those people are good people
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:27.000]  ollie we're about to go to break but but tell us
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.760]  when you start liking trump um well i started liking well at first i didn't
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:36.680]  like him i just didn't because but then like i like i
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:39.560]  started hearing him more and more and then i realized you know
[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:44.280]  this guy he knows what he's saying and that and like i started liking him
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.600]  like well maybe like five months ago yeah i'm the same about five six months
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:51.480]  ago is when watching the system have a hissy fit
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:55.560]  and it's so real like look at the the enemy hates him i gotta be foreign
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:59.320]  that means he's perfect though we gotta watch him
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:03.640]  do you know what it means to be an american it's more than a flag it's more
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:07.800]  than knowing the star spangled banner it's knowing the constitution it's
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:11.880]  understanding those rights and fighting for them our country is falling apart
[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:15.800]  because people have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:19.560]  and do the right thing it's putting your life on the line to protect your
[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.000]  country from enemies both foreign and domestic the bill of
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.160]  rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and no
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:32.280]  government should refuse or rest on inference so the tree of liberty must
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:36.440]  be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:40.440]  i'm joe biggs with info wars dot com and i believe our flag is more than
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:43.640]  clothening it is a symbol that stands for liberty
[02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:47.640]  and freedom it is a history of our nation and it's marked by the blood of
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:51.720]  those who died defending it so join me in this info war turn

[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.080]  think about it we're on this planet seven-and-a-half billion of us
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:47.000]  we got enough weapons to blow the planet up 50 times or more
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.720]  a lot of super secret weapons they developed
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:56.600]  antimatter projectiles planet destroying singularity

[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:15.080]  and the general public cares what hollywood people do on movies acting cool
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:21.800]  all a complete fraud and i've broken with it completely
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:25.640]  just now coming out of break i just completely disconnected from all over
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:29.080]  100 i still had tenuous connections but i just
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:31.480]  now
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:37.720]  it's insane you can see the whole deal
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:40.840]  i want to go back to your phone calls but i was going through these news
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:44.600]  articles and i again already knew this you already
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:49.560]  knew most of this but it was just crystallizing for me
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:56.520]  all the different things that are unfolding all the things that are
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:10:00.440]  happening and the elite have made the decision that humanity's trash
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:04.440]  and to use all this technological development to set up a highly
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:07.880]  synchronized well-oiled
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:16.440]  actuaried blueprinted over the horizon system to take control of planetary
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:19.000]  development
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:26.520]  to carry out the next phase of their plan
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:31.880]  and i don't know the next phase yet i mean they say they're going to kill
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:36.120]  80 of the public that's in the public documents in the higher level it's 90
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:38.920]  percent even to higher level academics they say no we're just
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:42.360]  going to kill everybody we're a disease it's a it's a cult of hating humans
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:45.320]  and only one superhuman will merge with the machine
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:50.680]  a la 2001 space odyssey then they admit that's just a hive mind of our
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:55.720]  collective consciousness to be uploaded to some larger being they
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:59.240]  believe they're building did somebody beam plans on a deep
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:02.280]  space into their heads or where did this come from it's directly out of
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.600]  childhoods end man i'm telling you folks i don't
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:12.680]  know exactly what's going on but it's bad it is bad news and i'm sitting here
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:17.240]  watching it and it's all mechanized it's all ordered it's all
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:21.400]  been wargamed and it's all been blueprinted and it's
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:25.880]  and that's all public and then i've got to sit there and watch
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:30.760]  weirdos on arrogant power trips on msnbc lie about myself and others
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:35.480]  like they're winning attacking me because they get to be on tv and prance
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:39.080]  around and show off to poor people at tv stations and
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:43.080]  you know be cool and be to the dnc and rnc around a bunch of
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:46.120]  sellout muppets
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:53.480]  the thing is they're selling out to lose they're selling out to fall when you
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:12:00.040]  sell out you don't win don't you want to see humanity win
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:02.440]  don't you want to learn what they're doing the mysteries
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:06.600]  don't you want to find out who's really running all this stuff no no no i
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:10.920]  i know don't want to do that i i want to oh i see all these men
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:14.440]  trying to look like the guy from the hangover he was got the beer or whatever
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:16.840]  and they're just trying they're all trying to be ironic and smart and
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:20.840]  intellectual and i don't feel tough that i could
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:24.760]  i'm not exactly i could take on like 15 of them folks i could go randomly pick
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:28.600]  out like 15 trendies big big big 200 pound ones whatever
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:32.280]  and i could just dominate all of them i mean just i'm not even in as a man i'm
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:36.280]  scared it's like i'm like tyrannosaurus rex compared to a
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:39.720]  gibbering idiot to these people
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:44.440]  and that's just physical prowess and will
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:47.720]  you
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:52.440]  200 years ago i was just the average model think about that
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:55.160]  think about that
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:02.200]  and so other people look at what they turn the public into and feel powerful
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:05.400]  that'd be like if you chopped a baby's arms and legs off and you know then put
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:08.120]  it in a gladiatorial ring against some six seven guy
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:12.200]  you know top combat champion he flies through the air and throws a spear into
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:14.520]  the baby and everybody throws rose petals at him
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:19.480]  how is that some big cool honorable thing you did
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:25.240]  i'm gonna go to your closet news i i just it's it's
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:29.160]  everything coming out is confirming my worst analysis
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:33.000]  and i just can't even believe it anymore
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:37.240]  let me just show you what i was reading during the break
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:41.480]  the world may have too much food where she always told us there wasn't enough
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:44.280]  foods we had to kill people now there's too much we'd have artificial
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:47.160]  scarcity so people aren't fat no people need to learn
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:50.760]  discipline and not sit in front of the television all day
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:53.400]  oh but you put a carrier wave in there that basically makes them do it just
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:56.840]  like you add additives to the fast food that make you get hungry again that's
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:00.040]  all public the very people doing this to us
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:05.240]  greasing the skids for our own weaknesses exacerbating the crises not
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:10.040]  letting them go to waste children now spend less time outside than
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:13.240]  the average prisoner it's rare to find children rolling down

[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:13.000]  weakness so people don't think it's any big deal and wander around it and
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:18.920]  don't look at it here's one article on the subject

[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:22.680]  as they've already gotten your blood major dna type but that everything's

[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:10.760]  transmission day the night's running the fourth hour
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:14.760]  coming up to dave
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:17.800]  look it's clear to anyone who's not completely
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:21.960]  brain dead and i mean that's seriously that the globalists are dismantling
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:25.640]  industrialized countries wrecking third world nations to control people
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:28.680]  they've got the resources they've got unlimited money that they make up out of
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:31.400]  nowhere that makes sense to cold-blooded people
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:34.360]  to want to wreck everything else to take it over
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:36.840]  they're not wrecking it though just to consolidate it then they want to
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:40.520]  consolidate it so that they don't need you put robots in charge of what they
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:43.000]  need done and then kill everybody else that then that's all
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.800]  been announced i mean i talked about that 20 years ago people thought i was
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:49.320]  nuts i was reading white papers now it's all over the news
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:53.720]  it'll sure be great the world without humans yeah it's coming soon
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:56.440]  yeah the elite may release a bio-weapon to get rid of as well it's kind of good
[02:24:56.440 --> 02:25:00.360]  for the earth you know like it's this intellectual thing
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:03.480]  that these trendies talk about you know they send me emails i talk to them on
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:05.960]  the street and they go well you know there's too many people i mean don't
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:08.520]  you agree we should just go ahead and kill everybody and i'm like
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:11.560]  but i can't use the word mother or father because that's hurtful though
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:15.320]  don't hurt anybody's feelings just kill everyone
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:17.480]  right
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:21.720]  and it's because these people have not been physically or intellectually
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:24.680]  challenged their whole lives they have been put in an anti-state
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:27.080]  they have been raised in front of a television set i'm going to cover that
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:30.920]  coming up and now we are coming down to the
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:33.480]  end of the line
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:39.560]  and the world may have too much food oh
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:41.960]  and a computer's going to know when you're sick even when you don't know
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:43.800]  so they're going to make you go to the hospital
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:47.560]  first time in human history people 65 and older will outnumber
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:52.360]  children under five isn't that just convenient
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:56.760]  you know what that simple article in those demographics means
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:00.600]  it always takes two and a half children to take care pretty much of one person
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:04.760]  economically you really need four or five this is the collapse of civilization
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:07.240]  this is the end of the growth curve even the elites admit
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:11.400]  we'll be lucky if we're three billion people in 150 years
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:15.160]  of course there won't be that many of the globalists have their plan
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:18.680]  but don't worry Saudi Arabia plans two trillion mega fund
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:23.400]  for post-oil era deputy crown prince crown prince
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:27.240]  his family 90 years ago took over and machine gunned a bunch of people
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:30.120]  and so now they're they're royal but there's no discrimination there or
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:33.880]  anything it's it's rawlt is fine just you know check your
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:39.960]  white privilege but world's obese population at 641 million
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:43.960]  global study finds the Saudi Reuters
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:52.200]  dead already just being prepared but let's get a phone call in and
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:55.960]  take more in this long segment coming up
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:00.440]  oh here's one at least 50 ISIS supporters are working as baggage handlers
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:03.800]  cleaners and catering staff at brussell's airport playing police
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:06.600]  yeah and they're not allowed to bust them see always the media is like blend the
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:10.360]  police blend the police nice be like yeah i saw this video this thug cop and
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:13.240]  we're crazy uh i don't like bullies the police are bad
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:16.440]  then i sort of sit back watching all the enemy operations set up the police
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:19.640]  worldwide because they got to get the police under their political control
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:22.840]  they got to get them politically damaged and hated so no one listens to them
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:26.280]  when they try to do their job so the globalists in the final
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:29.960]  phase can overthrow what's left of local police which they're doing and put in
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:33.800]  their own controllers and then it's game over
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:37.240]  and the White House admits that they've put out press releases going nowhere
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:40.200]  we're using these crises to federalize and globalize and the UN's going to
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:42.840]  advise and we're going to take over and we're going to have the police be
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:46.200]  social justice warriors and so now the folks that come up
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:48.600]  tell you have no free speech if you're a trump supporter they're going to be
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:52.200]  wearing police uniforms but by then there's going to be a
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:55.320]  horrible civil war against the police that wipes out tons of them who were
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:59.400]  innocent so laws will be passed and other things not allowing you to even speak
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:03.480]  back to them but they won't be made godlike enforcers
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:08.840]  until the old order of police with as much problems as it has
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:12.760]  still wasn't anti-family or anti-america still likes prosperity
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:16.040]  still at the end of the day didn't like child molesters they're all going to be
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:22.440]  thrown to the side all scientifically all directed
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:25.800]  towards you and would you admit you were under attack
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:31.880]  were you strong enough or did you bow Greg in Minnesota
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:35.720]  we'll go to John many others go ahead Greg
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:40.200]  yeah Alex we got to wake up the world now
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:43.240]  that we're under scientific attack we're under scientific attack the elite even
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:48.840]  call it that they admit it right here's my suggestion
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:52.440]  i'm calling on all info warriors listeners
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:59.240]  to buy a t-shirt an info war info wars t-shirt people
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:02.680]  wear t-shirts all the time that got messages on them
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:06.520]  and i have been in many conversations with people with stuff that's on their
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:10.360]  t-shirts i believe that people with summers coming
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:14.680]  and if people will buy their your t-shirts that have info wars dot com on
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:19.400]  them and get conversation going everybody needs to get their credit card out
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:22.600]  and order a t-shirt hold on i didn't know you renew this plug but but hold over
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:25.080]  because it's not about us making some money off this i could care less we
[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:27.720]  need to fuel the fighting enemy folks know that but
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:29.960]  i was thinking a lot of these trump rallies like 10 percent of people are
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:33.400]  wearing info war shirts that shows how active our folks are
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:36.600]  and absolutely if everybody listening would just buy a hillary for prison
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:39.400]  shirt or a moan lube shirt you'd meet so many
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:43.400]  like-minded people it isn't just about fun in the operation that's a small part
[02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:48.440]  that's the seed the tree that bears the fruit is you out there
[02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:52.280]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:59.320]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:59.320 --> 02:30:02.600]  it's friday so let's see what the tolerant and loving
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:06.520]  anti-trump supporters have been up to this week in their quest to stomp out
[02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:09.560]  fascism after offending a german jewish immigrant
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:12.840]  by waving a trump equals nazi sign right in his face
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:16.360]  a bernie sanders supporter told the man he needed to go back to germany
[02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:20.040]  further demonstrating the excessive hypocrisy of social justice warriors
[02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:24.040]  who are completely intolerant and in this case xenophobic to anyone who
[02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:28.040]  disagrees with their world views and to counter the violent rhetoric of
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:30.520]  donald trump a supporter of the never trump movement
[02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:34.840]  advertised t-shirts for sale advocating the assassination of donald trump no
[02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:37.720]  reports of anyone getting beaten for wearing this shirt yet
[02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:42.120]  not like immanuel who got jumped at his school for wearing a pro trump t-shirt
[02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:46.280]  he posted photos of the bloody bathroom and a photo of his tooth that got knocked
[02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:49.640]  out during the assault and how did the never trumpers respond
[02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:52.360]  well they proceeded to mock the boy on twitter
[02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:56.040]  just another week in the orwellian world of the lefty hypocrisy

[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:05.000]  and we're going down a very anti-human route that that
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.280]  hurts us the screen time the computers all of it
[02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:12.520]  is making us dumber slower more unhealthy all the numbers have been in for a
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:14.840]  long time and they're getting incrementally
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:18.680]  worse and everything new introduced gets
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:23.160]  worse still it's not naturally bad and some good
[02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:27.800]  some bad some good bad bad bad good good bad it's
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:33.240]  bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad straight down to hell
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:37.640]  hey man be positive you know go play some racquetball or go skiing or
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:41.400]  a lot of cool stuff dude you just decided to enjoy your life
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:45.240]  well here's the deal my life's not just about me
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:50.520]  personally and all my personal pleasures okay it's about the species and a
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:53.800]  larger goal and the mysteries of the universe all right
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:58.920]  plus if you just go out and have fun as a nihilist
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:02.600]  because believe me when i was a teenager in early in college
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:06.360]  you know to say i've done more stuff than most 70 year old executives by the
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:14.280]  time i was about 20 you're empty it's not fun anymore
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:19.720]  empty hedonistic mindlessness becomes empty very quickly
[02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:25.400]  the animating contest of liberty studying the real world studying the
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:28.680]  secrets becoming informed becoming involved that

[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:36.760]  and then when you do something that is
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:41.320]  fleshly that god gave us for enjoyment
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:49.240]  the sex is 50 times better the food is 50 times better that's a low number
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:55.720]  beauty is so much more beautiful everything is seen in clear eyes
[02:35:55.720 --> 02:36:00.760]  not through some mindless haze where you just go through the motions because
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:07.480]  you think you're appropriating or collecting something
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:13.160]  it isn't about collecting things it's about living and experiencing and being
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:18.920]  good and and turning your soul towards the mission of the universe
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:22.920]  that is god god created the universe god is the universe
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:27.720]  it's the mind of god we are floating like dust star dust in front of the light
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:33.400]  through the consciousness of god swimming in it experiencing it
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:38.520]  and these creatures these globalist they have knowledge of this floating in it
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:44.680]  and then decide their god and go on a rampage power trip
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:49.080]  not wanting other people around them to find out what's going on
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:52.600]  because we can't let them know this is going on we can't let them have access
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:56.200]  to this they'll be more powerful than us
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:37:00.440]  i mean these people are scum
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:07.160]  but you know what their answer to me always is okay alex why won't the profane
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:10.760]  listen to you and why won't the profane decide to learn
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:13.560]  about this if we're so bad why aren't they in charge
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:18.440]  we're in charge they say because we deserved to be
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:22.200]  and what we're doing is for the greater good even though some of it's painful
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:25.720]  and you can claim we have evil intentions but that's your opinion
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.240]  i've had globalist high-level ones that have wanted to meet with me i'll just go
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:33.560]  ahead and start telling everything get on their knees in front of me
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:39.720]  and beg me to join them with cares on their eyes
[02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:46.120]  on their knees as if that was some big humanity thing
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:50.120]  that they would do that it's all fake it's all garbage it's all bull
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:55.400]  they need to get on their knees before men and women
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:58.920]  and the love between men and women and the human species and empowering that
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:04.840]  let's see some love for them and then i'd die for whoever you are
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:10.600]  all you try to do is hurt these people i'll have nothing to do with you
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:16.360]  never never the globalists are a bunch of cowards
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:19.800]  they're afraid of the evil that they serve so they join it out of fear
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:22.680]  and they see somebody like me that's tuned into all this stuff and all they
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:26.200]  see is the evil splattering out and they love it
[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:30.040]  they think it's power all that is is a side reflection of everything else i'm
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:32.440]  doing
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:39.320]  you're so blind you can't even see it all
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:48.040]  you think you're god you're not i'm not
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:56.440]  we're in god's dream we're god's creation we're god's art we're god's music
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:01.720]  we're god's children we are a
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:04.840]  experience of god
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:10.120]  and god wants free will
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:15.400]  they say god's the sadist because god would allow pain in the world
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:18.760]  god allowed free will in the world and we did what we did
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:22.280]  and i thank god for consciousness and quite frankly i thank god for all the
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:26.520]  pain because i don't like pain
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:30.520]  but you know what the pain made me stronger and it made me be able to
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:34.680]  recognize what pleasure is because without the pain you
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:39.080]  couldn't recognize the pleasure could you and i get on my knees i lay flat on
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:42.280]  my belly before the creator
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:49.960]  because i recognize god when i know it when i see it
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:53.720]  and i'm gonna tell bill clinton hillary clinton and lord roth child and the
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:59.720]  rock of fellers all of you i don't see gods i see really scared freaked out
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:04.200]  broken people and all i say is to god is i'll do
[02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:08.920]  anything but i am twisted i am wicked i am weak i'm part of this planet you
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:14.120]  know that just please don't put my soul with them
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:18.760]  don't make me part of them i don't want to go with them and their dishonor
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:24.280]  their hatred their jealousy their weakness
[02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:34.280]  i know i'm evil but i try to be good and i hope god forgives me
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:38.360]  and i look at the people out there that serve this system
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:41.800]  and love to hurt the innocent children
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:48.200]  and i'll be honest with you my humanity that god gave me and that god gave you
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:52.600]  at birth cries out against you and i do want to i do
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:55.560]  want to come after you
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:02.280]  just like you go skin diving down to 75 feet
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:05.640]  you hit about 50 feet your chest pressurizes
[02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:08.440]  all of a sudden you've got more oxygen in your blood it's okay you get to the
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:12.280]  bottom spend 30 seconds picking up a few shells doing whatever looking at fish
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:17.400]  you start back up at the top about 30 40 feet from the surface
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:20.360]  there's no more pressure in the oxygen in your blood
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:23.640]  so now your oxygen star if that's the dangerous part and i know going on 75
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:27.320]  feet is not that far people go down 1200 1500 feet that's the
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:30.920]  power of this body the power of the mind of our creator
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:33.960]  that we're creatures that in an environment we're not even part of can
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:39.240]  go 1400 feet under the water controlling our minds
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:42.280]  controlling our fears
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:47.240]  but only once you get towards the surface and the water
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:51.240]  pressured is not great enough to pressurize the oxygen in your blood
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:54.760]  suddenly you realize you're starved and you want to go to the top
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:58.360]  i want to defeat the globalist like i want to breach the service
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:02.680]  and get air i don't want to defeat you to mount your head on the wall or to
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:05.560]  feel powerful i don't want to dominate the globalist because
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:09.240]  i want to be famous i want to get you off
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:13.560]  off of us you're suffocating us you're killing us
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:17.400]  you're stabbing us quite frankly you smell
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:23.160]  spiritually i want to be away from you and i have a right as a sentient
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:26.360]  conscious being to not be around you people and i don't want to be around
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:29.800]  you people let me tell you what hell is it's going to be all of you
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:35.640]  that resonate to what you're into together without us to feed on and to
[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:38.200]  push around
[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:43.000]  so this is a battle between good and evil
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.240]  and if you want to defeat the globalist you have to first defeat your own weakness
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:53.560]  and i'm telling myself this god knows god knows
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:56.840]  you've got to change your own heart you got to do it today
[02:42:56.840 --> 02:42:59.880]  you got to get your kids off the television get them off the ipads get
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:03.720]  them outside get the classical music on get them painting
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:06.680]  get them listen to music get them wrestling and having fun and giggling
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:11.720]  and laughing and it will disperse this enemy like magic because it is magic
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:14.920]  joy is the answer and i know i don't have enough joy
[02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:19.320]  i should be more joyful i should be more positive but i am aware of the globalist
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:23.080]  in their operations and it tears my guts out
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:27.000]  to watch them celebrating on the carcasses of so many innocent souls
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.200]  that they have deceived and twisted and turned inward
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:34.680]  and turned to their system the death of a soul
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:39.480]  it lives on but it's dead to god it's dead to light
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:43.400]  it's fallen forever
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:47.960]  is
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:52.680]  a very ugly sight
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:57.720]  and that's why the whole system is about telling you how weak you are the whole
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:00.120]  system is about how telling you how ugly you are
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:03.160]  whole system is about telling you that you're inadequate and that you don't
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:05.800]  have strength
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:14.840]  because you are so beautiful and so strong
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:22.120]  your potential that god gave you that touch of god is so
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:27.800]  transcendent that everything the system does is about telling you
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:32.680]  you are bad you are evil you are not worthy
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:37.000]  so that you will hate yourself yield to the world
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:41.160]  believe that it has the answers to fulfill you and wedge yourself
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:46.200]  to this
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:48.920]  i'm gonna stop preaching and i'm meant to get to more news in fact i'm gonna cover
[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:52.680]  news now and go to all the callers like john
[02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:57.960]  and mississippi first and uh michael in new york and others
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:01.560]  after we go to break but i only hit this whole cia news piece that i haven't been
[02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:04.040]  doing properly or maybe i should tape something to have for the show to do it
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:06.520]  proper
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:11.800]  so i can really have the time to go over it but
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:19.400]  i like that question from michael is trump doomed if elected
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:23.960]  yes yes he's doomed
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:28.840]  he's doomed but if he's for real and really wants to empower humanity
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:33.720]  they will destroy him but what he does will be victorious
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:37.880]  so it's a play on words it's a twisted riddle
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:42.040]  that he individually in the world will be pulled down
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:46.040]  but in the real eyes of god and the eyes of reality and the eyes of
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:51.400]  the great long term he will be victorious so do you want to be victorious
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:55.800]  in this world with this system endorsing it or do you want to be
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:46:01.080]  victorious for the long haul you want a medical chip to be able to
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:04.520]  get a prescription because that's what they're announcing
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:06.840]  they don't announce it to the public they're announcing it's all the medical
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:12.680]  people right now right now for next year your chip
[02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:16.840]  it's here it's here
[02:46:17.480 --> 02:46:21.800]  just let them inject you with some nano tech in a few years and
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:25.080]  you're gonna be able to live a lot longer the difference is though we want
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:28.840]  less stress we want people to be happy and you know this new nano tech has a
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:33.480]  way of calming you down you're gonna feel a lot better though
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:38.040]  just sign on the dotted line
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.760]  that you accept that we're gonna alter your brain irrevocably
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:46.840]  and we're gonna make everything all right here take my hand
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:51.640]  go ahead and take it never mind the fruits of what we do all the death
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:54.520]  of destruction the evil the deception just just go ahead and take it
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:57.960]  don't you want to believe you won the lottery don't you want to believe you're
[02:46:57.960 --> 02:47:01.480]  in the end club don't you want to believe
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:05.640]  you've arrived they're now being accepted you can finally be somebody
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:09.480]  we taught you you were a nobody because you were everybody
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:12.600]  but now it's okay we told you you were nobody just take our hand you'll be
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:16.200]  somebody just take our hand you're right you take their hand then you are
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:21.560]  nobody you are everything
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:23.560]  you
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:31.880]  think about it you're made in the image
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:44.760]  and the evidence bears it out of the god that made this planet
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:50.200]  and that god warns you in every ancient text and in the bible with precision
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:53.800]  of what would happen and how the enemy who'd fallen to this planet
[02:47:53.800 --> 02:47:58.120]  would try to destroy you and now you see every word of it being manifest and
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:01.640]  you don't think it's real
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:08.200]  a bunch of ignorant establishment preachers
[02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:12.600]  spend all their time trying to obscure
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:16.280]  to occult
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:24.600]  to hide what is flamingly obvious in front of your face
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:31.800]  we are the birthright for this planet it's our world
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:38.840]  not the fallen angels world it's ours
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:42.120]  but we have free will
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:46.680]  and we can listen to those lesser angels
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:51.560]  who promise to make us god and to give us the knowledge
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:56.200]  of good and evil we had the knowledge of good we had knowledge
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:01.000]  we were taught the knowledge of evil the twisted dark logic
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:06.040]  political systems of deception and disease and lies
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:11.240]  physical dna degeneration
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:16.040]  we took the program
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:21.720]  and boy imagine in those bodies with those minds
[02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:27.320]  what that knowledge was like then now it's a cage
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:34.040]  now it's a ball and chain now we know it's a prison
[02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:37.960]  but then didn't it look sexy because black

[02:54:16.520 --> 02:54:20.040]  by the way you look at all the new psychological diagrams and systems that
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:23.400]  were just made up by men the last 150 years mainly out of Germany for social
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:27.000]  control there's a lot of it that works a lot of it's true because it's just
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:30.600]  looking in human nature and then creating cosmologies around it
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:35.080]  workbooks templates out of it and then they will point at that and act like
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:39.080]  psychology created humanity or these people are gods
[02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:42.360]  and some are good people some are bad people but the governments and the
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:46.120]  corporations use it for social control big time
[02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:48.760]  and they say you don't have any free will you're just an animal we just program
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:53.880]  you oh but they though you know they're conscious they have rights
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:58.120]  they're the priest class and anybody that believes greatly anybody that
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:02.280]  envisions things anybody that is successful
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:06.600]  writing novels or music they go oh that's a narcissist
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:12.040]  they believe in great things they believe that humanity has a great destiny
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:16.360]  just look at what we built already it's a very cynical
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:21.000]  sick quiet twisted screwed up worldview
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:26.360]  you got groups competing with them as well you know with their own
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:30.360]  psychological systems they've basically made up
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:35.880]  i want to go to your phone calls
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:41.560]  nelson's called anyone so i alex jones is ranting and not taking calls
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:44.120]  i don't have to take calls nelson i mean i don't mean that meanly but when i've
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:46.680]  got something important to talk about i'm going to do it i actually took a bunch
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:50.040]  of calls today already but uh i don't think i'll be able to get to you though
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:53.080]  just because that's not in order i got john once again into obama using his
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:56.280]  presidency for agenda uh michael says his trump doomed
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:00.280]  have elected alex jones uh there's a question about that
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:06.360]  obama using possible trump bernie ticket well that's a nightmare scenario
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:09.720]  but um
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:16.040]  there's one thing i'm not i'm not patronizing somebody calls in and mad at
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:19.400]  me and says hey you need to do something i want it's just kind of cheesy
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:23.640]  i already know i'm a mess i don't need to sit there and try to satisfy you going
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:29.000]  to your call because you know uh you got it on the phone and we're
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.440]  been holding two minutes i i apologize to folks that i even take calls
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:35.240]  some days i really shouldn't take calls and have you sit there for an hour i
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:38.760]  guess that's the way to say it but let's change the subject off me not going to
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:42.920]  calls quick enough and talk about major defense contractors running child
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:45.640]  kidnapping rings i mean that's been in the major newspapers no one gets in
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:49.960]  trouble but i know it's an easier target me not going to calls uh let's talk to
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:54.440]  john and mississippi you're on the air go ahead sir thanks for holding uh yeah
[02:56:54.440 --> 02:57:00.840]  alex uh i wanted to call about uh obama i think that he's using the power that he
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:05.080]  has right now to put a stranglehold on middle eastern leaders and i also
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:08.840]  believe that he's probably going to move there once
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:12.360]  he gets out of the white house and also something
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:17.240]  that might be a little bit biblical if you look and you see the country of
[02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:22.520]  livia sedan iraq iran lebanon that's exactly where
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:26.600]  armageddon all that happens yeah but the thing is is turkey he's
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:30.520]  he's good friends with edgerton and turkey and
[02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:34.120]  there's supposed to be two men over the top of that one's a spiritual leader and
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:38.200]  one is a political leader and i wonder if obama might be
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:42.040]  one of those in edgerton's the muslim well there are many antichrist and many
[02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:45.480]  prototypes he's definitely an antichrist i appreciate your call
[02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:48.760]  great points yeah no he's pure evil funding radical islam to kill innocent
[02:57:48.760 --> 02:57:52.120]  muslims and christians everywhere uh he's here to destroy the country he hates us
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:55.080]  i mean it's it's true i mean it's i don't say that for rhetoric i mean it
[02:57:55.080 --> 02:57:59.400]  really is that bad uh michael in nevada thanks for holding on what's your point

[03:00:43.880 --> 03:00:47.320]  to you i'm gonna take a few more right now michelle in nevada
[03:00:47.320 --> 03:00:51.240]  what is your point on trump if he gets elected go ahead
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:55.080]  well i'm wondering how nobody could get anything done
[03:00:55.080 --> 03:00:58.760]  obama could never get anything done because the horrible republicans would
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:01.640]  never work with him what happens if we do get
[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:07.480]  an elected and nobody wants to work with him
[03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:11.640]  what do you think will happen i have no idea
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:15.640]  i am so confused i need you to tell me
[03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:21.400]  well here's the deal they've passed more bills they've ever passed in history
[03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:24.760]  the lobbyists write them we should get those bills passed that say you have to
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:29.400]  read the bills sometimes deadlock and gridlock is good
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:33.880]  that's why we have three different governmental systems
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:37.640]  so they get set against each other so a dictator
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:41.720]  as the president can't just ram stuff through but
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:44.760]  i think trump would have political support once he was in
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:49.720]  to try to expose what was happening by actually going against the globalist
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:53.080]  and get some fair tariffs some fair deals in place
[03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:58.520]  because again he he's an open free trader china has huge internal tariffs
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:03.080]  against us it's unfair uh trump wouldn't shut down our power plants
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:07.320]  that would make us competitive right there but that's a really good question
[03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:11.240]  my biggest concern is we're already going into a global collapse along your
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:13.880]  line and he could just get into office as the
[03:02:13.880 --> 03:02:17.320]  collapse happens and they blame a trump presidency for the reason
[03:02:17.320 --> 03:02:20.360]  everything collapses and not the globalist engineer in the whole thing
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:26.680]  do you see my point on that right right yeah i just have no idea
[03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:31.720]  i just i want to get behind trump i like you i didn't believe in him so much at
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:33.960]  first but now that everybody hates them all their
[03:02:33.960 --> 03:02:37.880]  establishment hates them i want to get behind him but
[03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:41.720]  i don't know ultimately how effective any of it's going to be well ma'am i think
[03:02:41.720 --> 03:02:45.160]  not watching as much tv getting outside getting healthy and i'm talking to
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:48.920]  myself here not you just getting back to nature
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:53.160]  thinking about god thinking about good things uh realizing that this world
[03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:57.480]  too will pass that's really how we transcend these people it starts
[03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:00.520]  individually as an inside job i really appreciate your call michelle have a
[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:03.960]  great weekend let's talk to michael louisiana you're
[03:03:03.960 --> 03:03:06.520]  on the air go ahead
[03:03:07.080 --> 03:03:10.520]  hi alex uh first of all i just wanted to say real quick
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:15.320]  uh your brain force is awesome man thank you it is a great new tropic it's the
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:20.600]  best we can manufacture well yeah i bought it around christmas
[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:26.360]  time and it was awesome thank you um uh you earlier you were talking about how
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:31.000]  the elections being stolen from trump and uh senator sanders
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:34.600]  and um i was just wondering what you think would happen if
[03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:38.520]  they both get it stolen from them if they join forces and run on an
[03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:42.680]  independent i've heard no one say that and it's it's kind of
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:47.080]  left field but but but really smart actually that's a good article to write
[03:03:47.080 --> 03:03:50.920]  but no one said that i don't think a third party trump sanders
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:54.760]  the question is who would be president uh the two are just so different on so
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:03:59.240]  many issues but still populist that would be
[03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:02.280]  that would be crazy and you know truth is stranger than fiction so who knows
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:05.960]  what do you think well i think that they have some
[03:04:05.960 --> 03:04:09.400]  similarities and they're both anti-establishment
[03:04:09.400 --> 03:04:13.320]  um and they would pull from both sides so i kind of think that it might be
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:15.560]  possible
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:20.040]  well i know this it's unprecedented to have mainstream media
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:23.720]  selling the idea of them stealing the popular vote
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:28.840]  of both men like it's no big deal i mean they are really trying to get us ready
[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:33.000]  to accept anything and i just ask what is the next shoe to drop that's the
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.560]  whole show we should do thank you so much god bless your
[03:04:35.560 --> 03:04:39.320]  mind john herman kyle and others day tonight's coming up

[03:08:17.880 --> 03:08:21.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show and david knight your host on this friday
[03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:27.480]  april first april fools day 2016 all of our stories are going to be as
[03:08:27.480 --> 03:08:32.040]  authentic as we can get them however we're looking at the news
[03:08:32.040 --> 03:08:37.560]  and as strange as it is we don't need to come up with anything crazy let me
[03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:39.960]  read you something that we covered on the nightly
[03:08:39.960 --> 03:08:44.040]  news last night this is on the drudge report yesterday the hill
[03:08:44.040 --> 03:08:48.600]  talking about why should turkish cleric fatala gulen operate charter schools on
[03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:52.360]  us military bases and the guy that talks about what's
[03:08:52.360 --> 03:08:55.880]  happening here with the charter schools and the gulen
[03:08:55.880 --> 03:08:59.880]  movement begins by saying that this is
[03:08:59.880 --> 03:09:03.320]  may sound like a conspiracy theory from the lunatic fringes i'm sorry it's so
[03:09:03.320 --> 03:09:07.800]  strange see that's the issue the real news is so strange
[03:09:07.800 --> 03:09:11.240]  it's hard to get people to believe it and of course the more audacious or
[03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:14.600]  audacious the plans the more likely they are to succeed because
[03:09:14.600 --> 03:09:17.720]  nobody really believes anyone's going to do this thing
[03:09:17.720 --> 03:09:22.280]  okay that's the way they get away with it he says a secret islamic movement is
[03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:25.960]  trying to infiltrate the u.s. military by establishing an operating publicly funded
[03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:29.080]  charter schools targeted towards children of american service
[03:09:29.080 --> 03:09:31.880]  personnel he says that makes that charge may sound
[03:09:31.880 --> 03:09:35.080]  like a conspiracy theory from the lunatic fringe but it's real it's
[03:09:35.080 --> 03:09:38.440]  happening right now it's been going on for quite some time and of course we've
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:42.440]  had many articles talking about the influence of the
[03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:45.640]  gulenists with the charter schools and of course the charter schools are
[03:09:45.640 --> 03:09:49.480]  operated with taxpayer money they're getting about half a billion
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:54.120]  dollars of us taxpayer money to operate about 150 schools here in the
[03:09:54.120 --> 03:09:57.160]  united states i've got about a thousand schools worldwide
[03:09:57.160 --> 03:10:01.960]  in other countries they can be explicitly religious in their training
[03:10:01.960 --> 03:10:06.120]  here they have to do it in a more subtle way
[03:10:06.120 --> 03:10:09.800]  and here's what the author the hill says he says luster be any doubt
[03:10:09.800 --> 03:10:13.160]  about the objectives in the united states the strategy of subtly
[03:10:13.160 --> 03:10:17.400]  indoctrinating school children and the gulen movement is a familiar
[03:10:17.400 --> 03:10:20.600]  one overseas there is great peril in allowing
[03:10:20.600 --> 03:10:25.400]  it to flourish in this country and as native turkey glenn created a
[03:10:25.400 --> 03:10:29.240]  network of hundreds of schools that have produced over the past three decades
[03:10:29.240 --> 03:10:33.080]  a vast cadre of followers who are now prepared to perform his bidding
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:36.520]  from official positions in the government and law enforcement
[03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:41.080]  and the judiciary and in the media says some have estimated that he currently
[03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:44.680]  controls more than half of the entire turkish police force
[03:10:44.680 --> 03:10:47.880]  and so the guy who wrote this robert amsterdam
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:51.080]  is the lawyer of a very high-powered international law firm he's been hired
[03:10:51.080 --> 03:10:55.320]  by the turkish government because this movement is so large it threatens
[03:10:55.320 --> 03:10:59.560]  erdogan in turkey now erdogan is not a great guy either but let me
[03:10:59.560 --> 03:11:03.880]  ask you does it really matter if they're pushing islam or if they're pushing
[03:11:03.880 --> 03:11:09.160]  turkey or if they're pushing fatala gulen as someone that you need to follow
[03:11:09.160 --> 03:11:12.920]  see that's what we have to be concerned about with education
[03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:17.480]  education has potential to be indoctrination and it doesn't always
[03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:20.840]  been used that way by the government when they run
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:23.480]  education going all the way back to play toes republic
[03:11:23.480 --> 03:11:27.480]  he wanted to divorce the children from their families
[03:11:27.480 --> 03:11:31.640]  he wanted to encourage promiscuity so that none of the children even knew
[03:11:31.640 --> 03:11:34.440]  who their parents were he didn't want there to be families he wanted to
[03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:37.720]  abolish the family he wanted the only family to be
[03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:41.640]  the state that would be the way that they would control children
[03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:45.160]  and of course that has been the objective of the social engineers of the
[03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:49.560]  socialists in this country they tried experimenting with
[03:11:49.560 --> 03:11:53.800]  communists communes in mid 1800s they failed and they said well
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:58.120]  the problem isn't socialism or communism the problem is the parents
[03:11:58.120 --> 03:12:01.960]  have installed these religious values in the kids or family values in the kids
[03:12:01.960 --> 03:12:04.120]  and we just can't get around that we need to get the kids
[03:12:04.120 --> 03:12:08.280]  at an earlier age and so now they're getting them at three and earlier
[03:12:08.280 --> 03:12:12.360]  forcing the women to go into the workforce even if they don't want to
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:15.160]  even if they don't want a career they have to go in for a second income
[03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:18.600]  because the taxes have become so high on our families
[03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:23.000]  and so we have these situations that we saw as Alex talked about earlier where
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.720]  it's rare to find children rolling down hills climbing trees spinning in
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:29.960]  circles just for fun because they are living the life of prisoners locked up
[03:12:29.960 --> 03:12:35.400]  in their homes and we have a story that also hit the national news today about
[03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:40.440]  a mother who was charged because she let her kids force her kids as punishment
[03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:44.280]  forced her kids to walk to school can you imagine
[03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:48.440]  that used to be a punishment that parents did to their kids all the time when I
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:51.400]  was going to school I used to walk to school we had neighborhood schools I
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:54.120]  used to have to carry some pretty heavy stuff when I
[03:12:54.120 --> 03:12:58.040]  walked to school as well because I was back in elementary school I was in
[03:12:58.040 --> 03:13:01.800]  band and I had a big band instrument to carry with me
[03:13:01.800 --> 03:13:05.880]  in the heat of Florida it was tough let me tell you you know
[03:13:05.880 --> 03:13:08.680]  crying my eyes out about this I didn't walk to school
[03:13:08.680 --> 03:13:12.440]  knee deep in the snow but it was pretty hard because it was hot
[03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:17.080]  come on kids can do it kids can do it it's not a big deal
[03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:20.280]  and we shouldn't be turning our children over to the school look at what
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:23.320]  they did in Virginia this is a story that's breaking today
[03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:26.760]  from the Washington Post okay this is not an April Fool's joke
[03:13:26.760 --> 03:13:32.040]  the CIA left explosive material on a school bus in Virginia
[03:13:32.040 --> 03:13:35.560]  after their training exercise for their canine dogs I said CIA
[03:13:35.560 --> 03:13:38.840]  CIA left explosive training material under the hood
[03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:43.000]  of a Ludon County school bus after training exercise last week a bus that
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.640]  was used to ferry elementary and high school students
[03:13:45.640 --> 03:13:50.040]  to and from school on Monday and Tuesday with the material still sitting
[03:13:50.040 --> 03:13:55.080]  under the engine compartment now they say this was a putty type material like
[03:13:55.080 --> 03:13:59.960]  C4 explosive that needed a detonator to make it explode so there was no chance
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:03.240]  that it was just going to randomly go off nevertheless
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:08.200]  nevertheless this is in so many different ways you could draw so many
[03:14:08.200 --> 03:14:11.960]  different parallels about how our children are being used for
[03:14:11.960 --> 03:14:15.320]  training exercise and of course school itself
[03:14:15.320 --> 03:14:18.760]  has literally become a prison I mean we're talking about children
[03:14:18.760 --> 03:14:21.880]  not getting outside and not playing and we've had numerous
[03:14:21.880 --> 03:14:25.560]  accounts and we've interviewed people who are actually trying to start a
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:29.080]  movement to educate this society that it's a good
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:32.680]  thing for kids to play outside because if you let them play outside if you let
[03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:36.680]  them walk to school you can have CPS come in and try to
[03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:39.800]  take your children away it's absolutely insane look at this
[03:14:39.800 --> 03:14:43.640]  Saudi Arabia plans a two trillion dollar mega fund
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:47.560]  for the post-oil era now they're saying this fun to be
[03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:52.840]  the world's largest it could basically buy up the four
[03:14:52.840 --> 03:14:56.440]  largest market cap companies apple google microsoft
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:15:00.280]  and berkshire hathaway they could buy all of them with this fund
[03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:04.760]  two trillion dollars and of course they're looking at this
[03:15:04.760 --> 03:15:08.200]  because they're looking at what happens when
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:12.120]  oil loses its influence the handwriting is on the wall
[03:15:12.120 --> 03:15:16.760]  that's what we're talking about with the justification for global governance
[03:15:16.760 --> 03:15:20.200]  they are going to essentially shut down our fossil
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:23.480]  fuels industry so they're looking at what they can do
[03:15:23.480 --> 03:15:27.080]  to buy up america and we've seen a lot of this this week
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:30.760]  reported on the nightly news on monday how Saudi Arabia was buying
[03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:34.840]  massive water property rights in california there
[03:15:34.840 --> 03:15:38.360]  they have this law that goes back to the mining days
[03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:41.960]  goes back to an 1877 law where the first person
[03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:45.480]  in line essentially gets all the rights so they have bought
[03:15:45.480 --> 03:15:48.840]  property that gives them water rights to the water that's flowing into
[03:15:48.840 --> 03:15:53.240]  california they could essentially cut off as much of that water as they
[03:15:53.240 --> 03:15:56.840]  wish and do it legally we also have the chinese
[03:15:56.840 --> 03:16:00.680]  that are looking at the chinese insurance company looking to buy a huge
[03:16:00.680 --> 03:16:04.680]  hotel chain to spend 15 billion dollars to get this massive
[03:16:04.680 --> 03:16:08.040]  chain they're competing with marriott this is a chinese insurance company
[03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:12.040]  they've never been in the hotel business before but they're desperate
[03:16:12.040 --> 03:16:16.600]  to get their money into something other than just dollar bills
[03:16:16.600 --> 03:16:21.160]  so we look at what's happening understand that it is our new owners the
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:25.080]  Saudis and the chinese why is this happening of course it goes back to
[03:16:25.080 --> 03:16:28.600]  the trade policies that we've had nafta and what's going to be coming up with
[03:16:28.600 --> 03:16:32.280]  tpp the trans-pacific as well as the transatlantic
[03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:36.120]  partnership that will have trade rewritten managed
[03:16:36.120 --> 03:16:39.400]  offshore these trade agreements have been written as we've
[03:16:39.400 --> 03:16:43.160]  pointed out many many times have been written by corporate lawyers
[03:16:43.160 --> 03:16:47.320]  of the multinational corporations our elected representatives had nothing
[03:16:47.320 --> 03:16:50.920]  to do with it and were essentially passive
[03:16:50.920 --> 03:16:55.000]  in all this except for senator sessions who pointed it out to the public who
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:58.520]  pointed it out to the senate but again they went ahead with it
[03:16:58.520 --> 03:17:03.000]  anyway it has not been finalized but believe me it will be
[03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:06.520]  unless donald trump is president there's not anybody else
[03:17:06.520 --> 03:17:10.040]  who is going to stop this nobody else is even talking about it except for
[03:17:10.040 --> 03:17:12.920]  bernie sanders i don't think he has the energy or
[03:17:12.920 --> 03:17:17.000]  the will to be able to stand against all of these congressmen and the
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:20.360]  bureaucracy that want this to happen as well as the multinational corporations
[03:17:20.360 --> 03:17:23.880]  i think only donald trump would do it it's something that he's talked about
[03:17:23.880 --> 03:17:27.560]  for 35 years and of course we can look at the effects of nafta
[03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:31.640]  now the saudis and the chinese have so much money
[03:17:31.640 --> 03:17:35.240]  they are going to be our new owners how do you like
[03:17:35.240 --> 03:17:39.400]  how would you like to live under the chinese communist oligarchs
[03:17:39.400 --> 03:17:43.480]  or the saudi rulers you see how they treat their people
[03:17:43.480 --> 03:17:47.560]  do you want to live under that type of environment where those people
[03:17:47.560 --> 03:17:51.000]  own everything take a look at what's happening
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:54.120]  with the epa for example as they're shutting down the oil industry and
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:57.160]  that's what's behind this saudi arabian plan
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:01.880]  to create a two trillion dollar mega fund to put their money in it and diversify
[03:18:01.880 --> 03:18:05.560]  as the oil industry is going down of course we are shutting down
[03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:10.200]  our own coil coal industry as they were questioning the
[03:18:10.200 --> 03:18:16.280]  epa director gena mccarthy capital hill about the epa regulations
[03:18:16.280 --> 03:18:19.640]  the republican from west virginia who is questioning her on that pointed out
[03:18:19.640 --> 03:18:23.480]  that 40 of america's power comes from coal
[03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:27.560]  yet the federal government has put 33 of our coal
[03:18:27.560 --> 03:18:31.000]  off limits so we're doing it to ourselves
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:34.120]  it's not just that we're being outsmarted by people abroad
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:39.160]  they're deliberately trying to shut the coal industry down and it is not
[03:18:39.160 --> 03:18:42.680]  about the environment understand that and she admits that
[03:18:42.680 --> 03:18:47.000]  and so we have this article on the new american epa boss says coal regulations
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:52.200]  are about the politics of power gena mccarthy administrative the epa
[03:18:52.200 --> 03:18:55.800]  admitted that the real reason for the epa regulations is quote
[03:18:55.800 --> 03:19:00.520]  showing sort of domestic leadership as well as garnering support around the
[03:19:00.520 --> 03:19:03.240]  country for the agreement that we reached in paris in other words
[03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:09.480]  this is about enforcing the climate treaty that was done in paris and this
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:14.200]  is a huge issue this is why i think it was so important
[03:19:14.200 --> 03:19:20.360]  uh to look at scalia's death it came up at a very very fortunate time for the
[03:19:20.360 --> 03:19:24.040]  abomb administration everybody was saying we've got this
[03:19:24.040 --> 03:19:27.160]  lawsuit that is working its way through the courts we've got a majority of the
[03:19:27.160 --> 03:19:31.000]  states i think it's like uh 26 27 states are challenging these
[03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:35.240]  arbitrary epa regulations and of course the epa commissioner says
[03:19:35.240 --> 03:19:39.000]  these regulations she admits the regulations will have absolutely no
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:43.240]  effect on global warming it is there she says simply
[03:19:43.240 --> 03:19:46.360]  to enforce the agreement that we reached in paris
[03:19:46.360 --> 03:19:49.560]  which is about global warming this isn't going to do anything about it but we
[03:19:49.560 --> 03:19:52.840]  have to put our power there we have to establish
[03:19:52.840 --> 03:19:57.720]  global governance and of course scalia was the person in the way no more stay

[03:25:42.200 --> 03:25:45.320]  i was just talking about what's going on with the
[03:25:45.320 --> 03:25:51.000]  epa regulations how there is a naked power play going on by the
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:54.760]  by the administrator of the epa gena mccarthy and of course remember we had
[03:25:54.760 --> 03:25:58.840]  Sheila Jackson previous administrator and she had some
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:02.600]  improprieties with her emails she was had a
[03:26:02.600 --> 03:26:08.040]  email alias it was absolutely nothing like Hillary Clinton but she resigned and
[03:26:08.040 --> 03:26:12.600]  in a shame with that of course she didn't go to jail she didn't have classified
[03:26:12.600 --> 03:26:16.360]  materials she was just setting up a different email
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:20.680]  account and violation of regulations but we're not going to enforce that on
[03:26:20.680 --> 03:26:24.200]  on Hillary Clinton because remember we had a consultant tell us that there
[03:26:24.200 --> 03:26:27.160]  ought to be a higher bar for people who are running for president in other words
[03:26:27.160 --> 03:26:30.040]  they should not be subject to the rules just like
[03:26:30.040 --> 03:26:33.160]  they're not subject to the rules for elections that they write for other
[03:26:33.160 --> 03:26:36.200]  people when they want to run for office we waive those rules we're going to talk
[03:26:36.200 --> 03:26:38.680]  about that in just a moment we're going to talk about the reaction to it i want
[03:26:38.680 --> 03:26:44.920]  to finish up though on what's going on with this power grab with the epa
[03:26:44.920 --> 03:26:48.840]  it all ties together with the supreme court you need to understand that
[03:26:48.840 --> 03:26:55.000]  maryk garland is going to be setting on the three judge panel this summer that's
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:59.160]  going to be sitting in judgment of these epa regulations this is obama's
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:02.280]  effort to take down the coal industry as he promised he would do
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:06.360]  when he was running for election of course he's not just
[03:27:06.360 --> 03:27:11.000]  writing it out on a pen he's using the perpetual bureaucracy these
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:15.400]  regulatory agencies that write our laws without our elected representatives
[03:27:15.400 --> 03:27:18.920]  they know they can't get this through congress so they're going to use the
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:21.400]  bureaucracy to run this through and we need to understand
[03:27:21.400 --> 03:27:25.560]  where this problem is because if we don't do something about it
[03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:29.720]  we are never going to get our country back we have all these regulatory
[03:27:29.720 --> 03:27:32.760]  agencies who basically do whatever they wish
[03:27:32.760 --> 03:27:36.120]  and the congress just sets back and lets them do it
[03:27:36.120 --> 03:27:39.320]  we have not only taxation without representation we have
[03:27:39.320 --> 03:27:43.480]  regulation without representation legislation
[03:27:43.480 --> 03:27:47.960]  without representation essentially now when we look at these rules
[03:27:47.960 --> 03:27:52.280]  this is not about saving the planet from global warming
[03:27:52.280 --> 03:27:56.520]  would you agree that the planet is undergoing global warming
[03:27:56.520 --> 03:28:02.040]  would you agree that it's being done by humans it is not about that
[03:28:02.040 --> 03:28:06.040]  the un's own ipcc the under governmental panel on climate change has
[03:28:06.040 --> 03:28:10.280]  pointed out that if we terminated all coal-fired power plants in america
[03:28:10.280 --> 03:28:14.440]  so that we didn't burn one single ton of coal in america
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:18.520]  the total reduction to co2 worldwide would only be
[03:28:18.520 --> 03:28:23.320]  two-tenths of one percent so if you get rid of all the coal in our country
[03:28:23.320 --> 03:28:26.920]  which again it provides 40 percent of the power in this country
[03:28:26.920 --> 03:28:30.920]  we have massive coal reserves we wouldn't need a single drop
[03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:35.800]  of oil from saudi arabia if we were to utilize our coal and we could do that
[03:28:35.800 --> 03:28:38.280]  cleanly we have the technology to burn it cleanly but
[03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:44.280]  this is about a pure power play understand that even within the fossil fuel
[03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:47.320]  industry there's competition you saw this in the
[03:28:47.320 --> 03:28:51.560]  iowa caucus you saw how ted cruz was allied with the
[03:28:51.560 --> 03:28:56.200]  coal industry against the ethanol industry there
[03:28:56.200 --> 03:28:59.480]  and of course the coal industry is another industry so they're all
[03:28:59.480 --> 03:29:03.240]  jockeying for a position to see if they can use the government
[03:29:03.240 --> 03:29:06.920]  to shut down their competition and of course the rest of us
[03:29:06.920 --> 03:29:09.880]  suffer as they go through this process but
[03:29:09.880 --> 03:29:14.440]  where this all is important is in the supreme court
[03:29:14.440 --> 03:29:18.840]  maryc garland the guy who is going to be making the decision again it's a three
[03:29:18.840 --> 03:29:23.960]  panel uh judge system there in dc it was understood that they were going to
[03:29:23.960 --> 03:29:27.160]  approve and give a rubber stamp to the epa because one of the things you need
[03:29:27.160 --> 03:29:30.840]  to understand about this guy that obama has nominated to the supreme court
[03:29:30.840 --> 03:29:34.440]  is that he always defers to these bureaucracies he always says they're the
[03:29:34.440 --> 03:29:37.880]  experts they're the scientists even when it comes to something as absurd
[03:29:37.880 --> 03:29:43.080]  as a dea saying that there is absolutely no medical value to marijuana
[03:29:43.080 --> 03:29:46.520]  this is what we've seen from the supreme court they don't even care
[03:29:46.520 --> 03:29:49.880]  if it's the law they don't care if it's the constitution does it work we'll be
[03:29:49.880 --> 03:29:59.320]  right back empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:59.320 --> 03:30:02.600]  it's friday so let's see what the tolerant and loving
[03:30:02.600 --> 03:30:06.440]  anti-trump supporters have been up to this week in their quest to stomp out
[03:30:06.440 --> 03:30:09.720]  fascism after offending a german jewish immigrant by
[03:30:09.720 --> 03:30:12.920]  waving a trump equals nazi sign right in his face a
[03:30:12.920 --> 03:30:16.360]  bernie sanders supporter told the man he needed to go back to germany
[03:30:16.360 --> 03:30:19.960]  further demonstrating the excessive hypocrisy of social justice warriors
[03:30:19.960 --> 03:30:24.040]  who are completely intolerant and in this case xenophobic to anyone who
[03:30:24.040 --> 03:30:27.960]  disagrees with their worldviews and to counter the violent rhetoric of
[03:30:27.960 --> 03:30:30.440]  donald trump a supporter of the never trump movement
[03:30:30.440 --> 03:30:34.840]  advertised t-shirts for sale advocating the assassination of donald trump no
[03:30:34.840 --> 03:30:37.640]  reports of anyone getting beaten for wearing this shirt yet
[03:30:37.640 --> 03:30:42.040]  not like immanuel who got jumped at his school for wearing a pro trump t-shirt
[03:30:42.040 --> 03:30:45.960]  he posted photos of the bloody bathroom and a photo of his tooth that got
[03:30:45.960 --> 03:30:49.640]  knocked out during the assault and how did the never trumpers respond
[03:30:49.640 --> 03:30:52.360]  well they proceeded to mock the boy on twitter
[03:30:52.360 --> 03:30:56.040]  just another week in the orwellian world of the lefty hypocrisy

[03:33:06.360 --> 03:33:10.040]  on the gcm radio network
[03:33:12.920 --> 03:33:15.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and i want to tell the
[03:33:15.720 --> 03:33:19.320]  callers terry herman kyle hang on i'm going to come to you in just a moment
[03:33:19.320 --> 03:33:23.800]  we have a breaking article here at info wars dot com ms mbc says
[03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:27.160]  trump supporters quote like alex jones unquote
[03:33:27.160 --> 03:33:31.640]  are prepared to revolt over the nomination they say that jones encourages
[03:33:31.640 --> 03:33:35.480]  trump supporters to show up in cleveland ahead of uh to outnumber
[03:33:35.480 --> 03:33:39.800]  soros operatives they seem to be implying that there's going to be
[03:33:39.800 --> 03:33:44.040]  something bad about that i don't see a problem
[03:33:44.040 --> 03:33:47.480]  in terms of showing up to show your support
[03:33:47.480 --> 03:33:51.320]  they may not like the way that alex says it i guess on ms mbc they certainly
[03:33:51.320 --> 03:33:55.240]  disagree with us on all the politics but that's absolutely
[03:33:55.240 --> 03:33:58.280]  true alex said being cleveland for the week of the convention be there we're
[03:33:58.280 --> 03:34:02.040]  going to absolutely show the world the real power of the people we need five
[03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:06.280]  million constitutional trumpians or trumpets to be there so that all the
[03:34:06.280 --> 03:34:09.560]  soros trash all the filth the few hundred thousand they'll have
[03:34:09.560 --> 03:34:13.080]  they're totally dwarfed by an establishment doesn't dare steal the
[03:34:13.080 --> 03:34:16.920]  popular vote from the people that's right
[03:34:16.920 --> 03:34:21.080]  why should we just stand by passively and let them steal vote
[03:34:21.080 --> 03:34:24.440]  listen to what ben karson said you know gentle ben
[03:34:24.440 --> 03:34:28.120]  ben karson he never raises his voice never gets animated
[03:34:28.120 --> 03:34:32.920]  listen to what he said today on the hill ben karson says rnc
[03:34:32.920 --> 03:34:36.280]  tries to pick and choose who the candidate should be well you know they
[03:34:36.280 --> 03:34:39.880]  tried they failed so now they're going to go into
[03:34:39.880 --> 03:34:43.720]  theft mode but here's what ben karson said he said the rnc
[03:34:43.720 --> 03:34:48.200]  the dnc everybody needs to recognize this country was built around the will
[03:34:48.200 --> 03:34:52.200]  of the people you remember the constitution remember how it starts
[03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:56.760]  we the people that is what the politicians
[03:34:56.760 --> 03:35:01.240]  sign or say they're pledged to when they take office they're supposed to
[03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:04.760]  be acknowledging the fact that we have the rule of law
[03:35:04.760 --> 03:35:08.920]  that we have rules that matter but of course they make the rules
[03:35:08.920 --> 03:35:12.360]  and then they bend and break the rules as they wish ben karson goes on to say
[03:35:12.360 --> 03:35:16.120]  all these pundits all these big time political players need to stop for a
[03:35:16.120 --> 03:35:19.160]  moment and they need to say do we really care
[03:35:19.160 --> 03:35:22.680]  about what the people want he says hopefully between now and then they'll
[03:35:22.680 --> 03:35:26.360]  come to understand that if they try and undermine the will of the people they
[03:35:26.360 --> 03:35:30.920]  will not only have destroyed their party but they will fundamentally change
[03:35:30.920 --> 03:35:36.200]  the united states of america what the republicans are doing
[03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:40.120]  is engaging in something that is extremely dangerous right now
[03:35:40.120 --> 03:35:43.640]  and i want to tell you when we look at the wisconsin election that's coming up
[03:35:43.640 --> 03:35:48.200]  on tuesday understand that this wisconsin
[03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:52.600]  gop primary is nothing but a giant push poll do you know what a push poll is
[03:35:52.600 --> 03:35:56.760]  push poll is where you call up and you give people some information invite
[03:35:56.760 --> 03:36:01.080]  them to give you your opinion that you don't really care what it is you're
[03:36:01.080 --> 03:36:05.080]  really trying to manipulate them you give them a question the question is
[03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:09.240]  worded in such a way that you make them
[03:36:09.240 --> 03:36:12.440]  come to a particular conclusion they typically do push polls
[03:36:12.440 --> 03:36:17.720]  right before a primary that's part of the dirty politics rule book
[03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:22.200]  wisconsin is nothing but a giant push poll in terms of the number of delegates
[03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:26.680]  is irrelevant it is you being used to control you by creating a narrative the
[03:36:26.680 --> 03:36:31.640]  establishment is doing this take a look at who is in wisconsin
[03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:36.120]  we've got scott walker paul ryan and writes previs scott walker the candidate
[03:36:36.120 --> 03:36:39.880]  who never even had a pulse even though the mainstream
[03:36:39.880 --> 03:36:44.360]  media was pushing him as the inevitable nominee remember that
[03:36:44.360 --> 03:36:48.680]  but then they couldn't find a pulse once they got to uh uh the first
[03:36:48.680 --> 03:36:52.040]  of the primaries the the well he didn't even make it to the primaries he didn't
[03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:56.040]  make it past the first debate he dropped out after one or two debates then we
[03:36:56.040 --> 03:36:59.160]  have paul ryan the speaker of the house the guy who
[03:36:59.160 --> 03:37:03.720]  immediately funded the climate treaty for obama you know three days after the
[03:37:03.720 --> 03:37:07.560]  climate treaty was agreed to by the obama administration
[03:37:07.560 --> 03:37:11.560]  they gave him a blank check with the omni bust bill
[03:37:11.560 --> 03:37:15.240]  spell that with a t because they're busting our economy with this massive
[03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:17.560]  spending they gave him a blank check for that
[03:37:17.560 --> 03:37:21.640]  they gave him a blank check for obama care for everything they took it all
[03:37:21.640 --> 03:37:25.880]  off the table and they did the funded the climate change
[03:37:25.880 --> 03:37:29.640]  treaty just three days after they had agreed to it in paris
[03:37:29.640 --> 03:37:32.920]  then you've got previs who says you know this really isn't an election they're
[03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:36.760]  just trying to join us the establishment all three of those
[03:37:36.760 --> 03:37:41.480]  guys scott walker paul ryan and previs the r&c chair
[03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:47.320]  they're all there from wisconsin so this is something that the establishment
[03:37:47.320 --> 03:37:50.840]  has set this up this is the only thing happening for a couple weeks and pull
[03:37:50.840 --> 03:37:54.920]  that poll up you guys pull that up again the real real clear politics poll
[03:37:54.920 --> 03:37:58.760]  when we look at the wisconsin polls and we again we talk about how polls are
[03:37:58.760 --> 03:38:02.360]  used to adjust people's opinions and i i guess
[03:38:02.360 --> 03:38:06.120]  when you've got the r&c delegate saying well we're going to choose who the
[03:38:06.120 --> 03:38:09.240]  nominee is regardless of who the voters pick and they
[03:38:09.240 --> 03:38:12.760]  ask him well why do we have primaries and caucuses and he goes well that's a
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:16.040]  really good question let me tell you why because they're
[03:38:16.040 --> 03:38:20.200]  trying to prepare you for what they think they're going to do
[03:38:20.200 --> 03:38:22.920]  one way or the other that's why we need to stand up
[03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:27.400]  and massive numbers and tell them you're not going to get away with this
[03:38:27.400 --> 03:38:30.920]  look at these polls again we've got six polls
[03:38:30.920 --> 03:38:35.480]  that have been taken in the last going back to the 19th is the oldest one
[03:38:35.480 --> 03:38:39.320]  now one that was taken between the 22nd and the 24th
[03:38:39.320 --> 03:38:42.920]  is the optimist poll it's the only one that shows trump winning
[03:38:42.920 --> 03:38:46.520]  the rest of these show cruise winning two of them show cruise winning by one
[03:38:46.520 --> 03:38:49.640]  point one of them shows cruise winning by five
[03:38:49.640 --> 03:38:54.120]  points two of them show cruise winning by 10 points one of them by marquette
[03:38:54.120 --> 03:38:57.560]  another one done by fox news oh we can always trust
[03:38:57.560 --> 03:39:03.240]  fox news to be objective can't we i'm sure they got frank lots involved in
[03:39:03.240 --> 03:39:07.480]  that uh checking the people's pulse on that but those two show him head at
[03:39:07.480 --> 03:39:11.160]  10 points but there's one that shows trump ahead by two points
[03:39:11.160 --> 03:39:15.160]  there's something fundamentally different about this optimist poll if you
[03:39:15.160 --> 03:39:20.040]  look at real real clear politics all these other polls are
[03:39:20.040 --> 03:39:25.720]  looking at about 400 to 700 voters likely voters they say now these
[03:39:25.720 --> 03:39:28.680]  are going to be people who are not crossing over
[03:39:28.680 --> 03:39:32.600]  from independent or democrat and i don't know if that's allowed in wisconsin
[03:39:32.600 --> 03:39:35.800]  so that may or may not be a factor there they do that everywhere
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:39.480]  but the one poll that shows trump winning has
[03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:44.840]  6200 people not 400 not 500 not 600
[03:39:44.840 --> 03:39:49.800]  6200 people and it shows up when you look at the margin of error
[03:39:49.800 --> 03:39:53.640]  all the rest of these polls are between four and six percent
[03:39:53.640 --> 03:39:57.880]  margin of error the poll that shows trump ahead
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:01.400]  has a one percent margin of error because they've got a much
[03:40:01.400 --> 03:40:05.720]  larger sample size they've got 6200 people what do you see on all the
[03:40:05.720 --> 03:40:10.520]  articles everywhere though you see the small poll that polls 400 people
[03:40:10.520 --> 03:40:14.040]  the one from marquette or the one from fox news they say look at this
[03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:17.800]  ted cruz has all the momentum and that's what they're doing
[03:40:17.800 --> 03:40:21.560]  before the election and that's what they're going to do when they rig the
[03:40:21.560 --> 03:40:24.520]  election for ted cruz one way or the other
[03:40:24.520 --> 03:40:27.880]  that's what they're going to they're they're going to say ted cruz now has
[03:40:27.880 --> 03:40:32.200]  the momentum you have to understand that this is simply a game
[03:40:32.200 --> 03:40:35.400]  and you have to show up in such large numbers
[03:40:35.400 --> 03:40:39.080]  that they can't rig it that they can't steal it
[03:40:39.080 --> 03:40:42.280]  they have a lot of power to take the election and they've got a lot of
[03:40:42.280 --> 03:40:45.640]  different things that they can do to rig the election to deny the election
[03:40:45.640 --> 03:40:49.000]  to make sure that third parties and independents
[03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:53.160]  don't show up in the debates that they don't get on the ballots
[03:40:53.160 --> 03:40:57.080]  they can give themselves passes on the rules that they create and they can
[03:40:57.080 --> 03:41:00.520]  rigorously enforce them to keep other people off the ballot
[03:41:00.520 --> 03:41:03.960]  but if you show up in significant numbers
[03:41:03.960 --> 03:41:08.040]  they can't deny that they'll fall back and then they'll try to rig things
[03:41:08.040 --> 03:41:11.640]  after the election they'll they'll never give up okay and we can never give up
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:15.000]  that's why the price of liberty is eternal vigilance
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:18.600]  but they understand right now and ted cruz does he's part of this
[03:41:18.600 --> 03:41:22.520]  steal the vote effort he knows that he can't get 85 percent of the remaining
[03:41:22.520 --> 03:41:26.280]  delegates he doesn't have a chance so what's he doing
[03:41:26.280 --> 03:41:29.720]  he's trying to steal the election by making sure
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:33.240]  that even though he may be hundreds of delegates behind
[03:41:33.240 --> 03:41:38.040]  donald trump that donald trump doesn't get 50 plus one
[03:41:38.040 --> 03:41:41.400]  and then he is stealing the delegates on a state-by-state basis of course the
[03:41:41.400 --> 03:41:45.560]  same thing is going on with john casick he can't get more than 100
[03:41:45.560 --> 03:41:49.400]  percent which is what he needs to get so they're not in it to win it
[03:41:49.400 --> 03:41:52.680]  they're in it to steal it and they're not stealing it from donald trump
[03:41:52.680 --> 03:41:56.680]  they're stealing it from the voters who have expressed their preferences
[03:41:56.680 --> 03:41:59.480]  that's why they say well it really doesn't matter
[03:41:59.480 --> 03:42:02.920]  whether we have primaries or caucuses because we're going to make that decision
[03:42:02.920 --> 03:42:07.640]  let's go to our callers terry in minnesota terry go ahead
[03:42:07.640 --> 03:42:13.560]  hey david how you doing i'm listening i've talked uh i think alex maybe four
[03:42:13.560 --> 03:42:17.080]  times i'm a new listener maybe about a month and a half or so i pretty much
[03:42:17.080 --> 03:42:21.080]  got to just you guys um and as far as trump's concerned
[03:42:21.080 --> 03:42:24.680]  i've got some things on um alex it's time to talk to rob also about the same
[03:42:24.680 --> 03:42:28.280]  subject um i dropped this on that alex i think
[03:42:28.280 --> 03:42:32.440]  a week and a half ago or so anyway i said this i said if you look at the world
[03:42:32.440 --> 03:42:35.320]  stage and i know i know it's all about the world system the one world
[03:42:35.320 --> 03:42:40.040]  government right that's all biblical okay who who out there that you can see
[03:42:40.040 --> 03:42:43.880]  from any country that that could possibly just play along with the police
[03:42:43.880 --> 03:42:47.640]  that could possibly cause the deadly wound to happen and when i say that
[03:42:47.640 --> 03:42:51.640]  i'm talking about uh you yourself are a christian
[03:42:51.640 --> 03:42:56.280]  um this plan is in the book it's all laid out and uh the problem is when that
[03:42:56.280 --> 03:42:59.640]  when uh pulpit was hijacked about 2000 plus years ago
[03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:03.800]  we've got this mess and you've got thousands of churches and you got all
[03:43:03.800 --> 03:43:07.000]  these services and why are the people biblically illiterate you know i'm
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:11.000]  saying and when i told alex about that the shepherds chapel in
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:14.680]  northwest dark and saw that scholar that runs that church there hasn't been a
[03:43:14.680 --> 03:43:18.120]  scholar like that in a hundred years and that's why it's the largest it's the
[03:43:18.120 --> 03:43:23.080]  info wars of churches david it um there is no you know i understand but what
[03:43:23.080 --> 03:43:25.960]  yeah we got a limited amount of time i got other people on here too but but what
[03:43:25.960 --> 03:43:30.680]  what's it just of what you're saying but just as this is that um we're at the
[03:43:30.680 --> 03:43:34.120]  we're at the end this is the final generation okay and if you read the
[03:43:34.120 --> 03:43:37.480]  bible and if you believe the man this is it and like i said
[03:43:37.480 --> 03:43:41.320]  trump is going to get in okay um we're in the fifth teaching trump there's only
[03:43:41.320 --> 03:43:45.080]  seven total satan comes in the sixth if you read the bible you know that
[03:43:45.080 --> 03:43:49.480]  so who other than trump um could possibly possibly
[03:43:49.480 --> 03:43:53.080]  any the republican operatives anybody you can't put some the air
[03:43:53.080 --> 03:43:56.280]  there's no in on it everybody but trump is in on it you know i'm saying
[03:43:56.280 --> 03:44:00.520]  and just like god used obama to bring about the negative part in the rise of
[03:44:00.520 --> 03:44:03.560]  islam and isis and the whole nine yards he's going to use trump for the other
[03:44:03.560 --> 03:44:06.840]  side of this coin so you know when you guys worry about things
[03:44:06.840 --> 03:44:09.960]  quit worrying about this stuff this is all laying out you know and
[03:44:09.960 --> 03:44:12.840]  well let me let me tell you what my what my understanding is
[03:44:12.840 --> 03:44:17.320]  uh yeah i don't uh i'm not dogmatic about the book of revelations i think
[03:44:17.320 --> 03:44:19.800]  it's very difficult to understand and i think
[03:44:19.800 --> 03:44:23.000]  there are things that we are called to do that are very clear
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:28.840]  and um as uh martin luther said if i knew the world was going to end tomorrow
[03:44:28.840 --> 03:44:32.680]  i would still plant a tree today so i'm looking at
[03:44:32.680 --> 03:44:36.920]  what i need to do and the very simple thing that that works for me
[03:44:36.920 --> 03:44:40.840]  and it works for people who aren't even christians as you have to understand
[03:44:40.840 --> 03:44:44.920]  what's going on with the globalist now this may be the end of the world and
[03:44:44.920 --> 03:44:46.920]  maybe it isn't i know a lot of people
[03:44:46.920 --> 03:44:50.200]  believe that it was the end of the world when we had a world war going on and
[03:44:50.200 --> 03:44:55.320]  we had adolf hitler uh doing mass executions in his country so
[03:44:55.320 --> 03:44:59.880]  i don't want to try to interpret the bible in terms of current events i don't
[03:44:59.880 --> 03:45:03.000]  ever try to do that i just try to do the right thing
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:07.960]  and when i see multinational corporations stealing our country
[03:45:07.960 --> 03:45:11.080]  and doing things to shut down our government i know
[03:45:11.080 --> 03:45:14.680]  that's wrong it's just simple theft it's just that simple
[03:45:14.680 --> 03:45:19.080]  don't steal remember that that's in the bible it's a real clear principle
[03:45:19.080 --> 03:45:23.320]  so if we're going to stop the governments that are trying to steal from
[03:45:23.320 --> 03:45:26.040]  people if we're going to stop oppression if we're going to stop war if we're
[03:45:26.040 --> 03:45:29.240]  going to stop torture if we're going to stop this orwellian
[03:45:29.240 --> 03:45:32.920]  system of government that's there i'm going to keep fighting that whether
[03:45:32.920 --> 03:45:36.600]  this is the last generation or if we've got another 50 generations
[03:45:36.600 --> 03:45:40.760]  i don't know when the day is going to come i'm not going to say that i do
[03:45:40.760 --> 03:45:44.200]  and i'm not going to be dogmatic about that and i'm going to try to do the
[03:45:44.200 --> 03:45:47.480]  right thing and i know what the principles are that's why
[03:45:47.480 --> 03:45:51.560]  i oppose the police state the perpetual war state
[03:45:51.560 --> 03:45:55.720]  that's why i oppose politicians most of them who support that and of course
[03:45:55.720 --> 03:45:59.560]  donald trump has opposed the takedown of our country
[03:45:59.560 --> 03:46:04.360]  he has opposed the economic situations that are destroying us economically he
[03:46:04.360 --> 03:46:08.280]  has also opposed these perpetual wars and i think that's a good reason
[03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:15.560]  to support him as well let's go to herman in alaska herman go ahead
[03:46:15.560 --> 03:46:21.960]  hello hey go ahead carmen you're on hey how are you today thank you for taking
[03:46:21.960 --> 03:46:24.840]  my call i just wanted to uh get straight to the point
[03:46:24.840 --> 03:46:29.240]  um currently there um i'm a student here in alaska
[03:46:29.240 --> 03:46:32.360]  and currently there has been like advertisements
[03:46:32.360 --> 03:46:40.840]  over the past week about uh a quote emergency like fictitious training
[03:46:40.840 --> 03:46:46.120]  exercise of like a terrorist attack on campus and i just wanted to let you
[03:46:46.120 --> 03:46:50.920]  guys know that that was going on today yeah unfortunately they're having
[03:46:50.920 --> 03:46:54.760]  terror drills all the time everywhere it's just like that article i had
[03:46:54.760 --> 03:46:58.680]  where they uh did a bomb drill and left the c4 explosives on the bottom of the
[03:46:58.680 --> 03:47:02.840]  school bus after they got finished and that that's one of the things that
[03:47:02.840 --> 03:47:05.720]  used to be very significant when they would have a drill and of course we've
[03:47:05.720 --> 03:47:09.000]  seen many cases where we believe they're false flags when they
[03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:14.200]  have a drill that is exactly identical to the terrorist attack in terms of same
[03:47:14.200 --> 03:47:17.000]  time same place same tactic we saw that
[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:21.080]  9 11 we saw it again on 7 7 we've seen it over and over again
[03:47:21.080 --> 03:47:24.920]  but now they're having so many drills all the time because we live under a
[03:47:24.920 --> 03:47:28.360]  police state that isn't getting very difficult to say hey
[03:47:28.360 --> 03:47:31.640]  you can't predict in advance that just because somebody is doing a terror
[03:47:31.640 --> 03:47:35.880]  drill but that means that they're up to doing some kind of a false flag
[03:47:35.880 --> 03:47:39.960]  go ahead exactly i think this is more in response to
[03:47:39.960 --> 03:47:47.560]  sp 174 it's um like in alaska there's no law against
[03:47:47.560 --> 03:47:51.240]  concealing to our like having a concealed weapon on
[03:47:51.240 --> 03:47:59.240]  like our ua campus and ba or sp 174 was used
[03:47:59.240 --> 03:48:06.120]  or was um a bill in a sentence so that like we couldn't carry on campus without
[03:48:06.120 --> 03:48:10.840]  like being harassed by cops and polled to leave because it's part of their
[03:48:10.840 --> 03:48:15.160]  policy oh so you think it's kind of psychological conditioning to get people
[03:48:15.160 --> 03:48:18.120]  afraid that there's going to be some kind of a mass shooting if people are allowed
[03:48:18.120 --> 03:48:23.480]  to carry guns around college campuses yes exactly i don't know what they came
[03:48:23.480 --> 03:48:30.520]  back and um uh that's very problem yeah
[03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:34.280]  yeah yeah that's exactly the type of thing they would do absolutely
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:38.280]  um let's go to thank you very much i agree with you that's exactly the type of
[03:48:38.280 --> 03:48:41.400]  thing that they would do they would put something out like that just so they
[03:48:41.400 --> 03:48:44.680]  can scare people and say hey we need to make sure that this is a gunfree zone
[03:48:44.680 --> 03:48:48.040]  ignoring the fact that it's the gunfree zones where the
[03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:53.400]  shooters do the most damage let's go to ken and kuei go ahead ken
[03:48:53.400 --> 03:48:59.560]  ken and kuei hey sir delighted to be on board uh not sure what it's obviously i
[03:48:59.560 --> 03:49:02.440]  believe we're talking about gun control or we're talking about gunfree zones
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:06.120]  etc i i wholly agree with that the fact that all of
[03:49:06.120 --> 03:49:09.880]  these issues take place areas that are gunfree zones
[03:49:09.880 --> 03:49:13.640]  one of the things that i do here has been trying to express folks the fact that
[03:49:13.640 --> 03:49:18.120]  things that go on the states have an impact over all around the world
[03:49:18.120 --> 03:49:23.800]  to include the current election inside the u.s you know it's important that
[03:49:23.800 --> 03:49:26.600]  trump be elected it's important that somebody that actually
[03:49:26.600 --> 03:49:31.240]  represents the people be elected because we are not the american government
[03:49:31.240 --> 03:49:33.720]  right now this is what i've been trying to express
[03:49:33.720 --> 03:49:38.040]  folks here yes yes and now we understand that i i've never
[03:49:38.040 --> 03:49:42.280]  in my life i've seen a lot of corruption in elections but i've never seen
[03:49:42.280 --> 03:49:46.120]  the establishment of the parties especially the g.o.p which is the worst
[03:49:46.120 --> 03:49:48.840]  i mean it we heard all these people saying well you know obama might suspend
[03:49:48.840 --> 03:49:50.760]  the elections no it's going to be carl rove
[03:49:50.760 --> 03:49:53.640]  who's going to do it's going to be ryan's previous and they're bragging
[03:49:53.640 --> 03:49:57.880]  about it to the american people they're saying we pick who the nominee is
[03:49:57.880 --> 03:50:03.000]  you don't really have a say so over it i think even if trump doesn't win
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:07.400]  that's an important thing for people to get down
[03:50:07.400 --> 03:50:11.960]  to understand to fully digest that they need to understand
[03:50:11.960 --> 03:50:15.880]  how this system is set up and once they understand that
[03:50:15.880 --> 03:50:19.480]  then they will start to do something about it but uh they haven't understood
[03:50:19.480 --> 03:50:23.080]  for the longest time they they believe that fundamentally we have honest
[03:50:23.080 --> 03:50:27.480]  elections that we have a constitution and now we need to understand that no
[03:50:27.480 --> 03:50:30.520]  you don't you have a couple of political parties
[03:50:30.520 --> 03:50:33.880]  that are opera operating like they're a gangster
[03:50:33.880 --> 03:50:39.480]  operation we ought to hold them to the rico statute these are racketeering
[03:50:39.480 --> 03:50:43.320]  influenced corrupt organizations and we can see it now we can see
[03:50:43.320 --> 03:50:46.680]  precisely what they're doing when we come back and take a couple more calls
[03:50:46.680 --> 03:50:50.520]  and we're going to talk about how they are going to roll this out stay with
[03:50:50.520 --> 03:50:59.240]  us we'll be right back

[03:54:07.720 --> 03:54:11.720]  from MSNBC you know i think we need to
[03:54:11.720 --> 03:54:14.840]  i think we need to all look at what's going on and we can see it in the
[03:54:14.840 --> 03:54:17.800]  democrat party as well as a republican party this super delegate thing that's
[03:54:17.800 --> 03:54:20.840]  going on the democrat party or one candidate like Hillary starts out with
[03:54:20.840 --> 03:54:25.320]  a 15 to 20 point lead before it even starts that's bad enough and of course
[03:54:25.320 --> 03:54:29.480]  in New York they said even if she loses a popular vote we're not going to switch
[03:54:29.480 --> 03:54:33.320]  our votes to Bernie that ought to make people furious i don't support Bernie
[03:54:33.320 --> 03:54:37.560]  Sanders but that makes me really angry to see that process especially since
[03:54:37.560 --> 03:54:42.040]  the republicans and the democrats control access to the balance
[03:54:42.040 --> 03:54:45.080]  but what we see going on with the republicans is even worse and of course
[03:54:45.080 --> 03:54:48.040]  the mainstream media is chiming in with them we got bloomberg saying the
[03:54:48.040 --> 03:54:51.800]  republican national committee has begun to prepare the public
[03:54:51.800 --> 03:54:55.320]  for what they're going to do yeah prepare us for their theft then we got
[03:54:55.320 --> 03:54:57.320]  the washington post coming in here and saying
[03:54:57.320 --> 03:55:01.480]  trump could be stripped of his south carolina delegates he won every single
[03:55:01.480 --> 03:55:05.800]  delegate in south carolina because he won every single congressional
[03:55:05.800 --> 03:55:08.680]  delegate there that was when they were not winner take all
[03:55:08.680 --> 03:55:13.880]  they're proportional but he won it uh congressional district by congressional
[03:55:13.880 --> 03:55:16.040]  district but they come in here and they say
[03:55:16.040 --> 03:55:19.480]  well why wouldn't they take it from him this is a washington post
[03:55:19.480 --> 03:55:23.080]  why wouldn't they take his delegates away he broke his promise to support the
[03:55:23.080 --> 03:55:26.520]  republican nominee if it's not him during an interview earlier this week well
[03:55:26.520 --> 03:55:30.760]  so did Cruz so did kasek they all three said
[03:55:30.760 --> 03:55:33.960]  they're not going to support the other guy but they single out trump and say
[03:55:33.960 --> 03:55:37.240]  well we're going to take his delegates and they say it's like a game of
[03:55:37.240 --> 03:55:41.720]  calvin ball to harken back to calvin and hobs it's a game that's made up on the
[03:55:41.720 --> 03:55:44.680]  fly it takes place in calvin's house and it's where
[03:55:44.680 --> 03:55:47.720]  calvin already has a winner in mind but alex came in here and he said yeah i'm
[03:55:47.720 --> 03:55:51.240]  looking at this uh this clip i guess i'm a bad guy for saying that we
[03:55:51.240 --> 03:55:54.760]  ought to show up and protest this and show our strength and say we're not
[03:55:54.760 --> 03:55:57.640]  going to put up with this because i guess uh i should
[03:55:57.640 --> 03:56:01.080]  apologize and nobody should show up we should just let them go ahead with the
[03:56:01.080 --> 03:56:03.960]  steal let's play that clip from msnbc
[03:56:03.960 --> 03:56:08.280]  having won the popular vote in that state now his threat to break the g.o.p
[03:56:08.280 --> 03:56:11.480]  loyalty pledge could cost him delegates in south carolina
[03:56:11.480 --> 03:56:14.920]  we have to sign the pledge to get on the ballot in the first place
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:18.040]  amid growing signs that trump may not have the wherewithal to get enough
[03:56:18.040 --> 03:56:22.040]  votes on the convention floor supporters like info wars alex jones
[03:56:22.040 --> 03:56:26.040]  are now preparing to revolt be in cleveland for the week
[03:56:26.040 --> 03:56:31.480]  of that convention be there and we are going to absolutely show the world
[03:56:31.480 --> 03:56:36.680]  the real power we need five million constitutional
[03:56:36.680 --> 03:56:42.680]  trumpians trumpets to be there so that all the soros trash and all the filth
[03:56:42.680 --> 03:56:45.880]  the few hundred thousand they'll have there are totally dwarfed and the
[03:56:45.880 --> 03:56:52.040]  establishment does not dare steal the popular vote from the people
[03:56:52.040 --> 03:56:54.760]  according to one party operative i spoke to a couple weeks ago republican
[03:56:54.760 --> 03:56:58.360]  national committeeman named curly holgren the popular vote doesn't matter
[03:56:58.360 --> 03:57:00.520]  at all it's the delegates who really picked the
[03:57:00.520 --> 03:57:03.960]  nominee regardless of other citizens in their states voted
[03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:07.320]  the delegates are not bound they're free to vote their conscience
[03:57:07.320 --> 03:57:10.920]  on on all the issues before the convention and on the nominations
[03:57:10.920 --> 03:57:15.320]  anything is possible because the convention of the republican party
[03:57:15.320 --> 03:57:18.520]  is the highest authority of the party and they can do anything they want
[03:57:18.520 --> 03:57:21.640]  yeah we make the rules party more in control than in holgren's home state in
[03:57:21.640 --> 03:57:25.000]  north dakota where the voters are cut out of the process altogether
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:27.880]  while some states hold primaries and some hold caucuses and there's back and
[03:57:27.880 --> 03:57:31.160]  forth over which model is the most representative the north dakota republican
[03:57:31.160 --> 03:57:35.080]  party just holds a state convention to select its late of 28 delegates
[03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:38.600]  who are free to vote for whoever they want this summer in cleveland no voters
[03:57:38.600 --> 03:57:43.240]  needed at all thank you very much that convention kicks off tomorrow in fargo
[03:57:43.240 --> 03:57:46.440]  and two of the campaigns will go all the way there to make their case
[03:57:46.440 --> 03:57:50.040]  ben carson who endorsed on all trump is scheduled to speak at a sunday morning
[03:57:50.040 --> 03:57:52.440]  session not till after all the delegates have been elected

[03:58:12.840 --> 03:58:16.280]  the votes on time to get on the ballot but they say hey we're a hundred percent

[03:58:19.080 --> 03:58:22.600]  we see this over and over again happened in dc first they said well
