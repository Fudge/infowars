[00:01.000 --> 00:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[00:14.000 --> 00:20.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.000]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial commonwealth
[00:25.000 --> 00:31.000]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.000]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  It is a big idea, a new order
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  It was almost as if it were planned in motion
[00:47.000 --> 00:49.000]  It's just pancake
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals
[01:14.000 --> 01:22.000]  Guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed, we can take all of them
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.000]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  Global governance at last, is it one world, the central bank is in charge
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  And for me, give me liberty, or give me death
[01:39.000 --> 01:46.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com, with a buyer beware
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  There is a brand new product coming out from the tell called the Hello Barbie
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  It says the new Barbie will talk with children, record their conversations and send it to researchers
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  Now this Barbie has Wi-Fi capabilities, it connects to the internet and records your child's conversations
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  And sends it back to a database where researchers will analyze the conversations with your child
[02:18.000 --> 02:37.000]  And researchers say that they do this, so the toys' responses will become more complex
[02:48.000 --> 02:59.000]  There's nothing that could possibly go wrong with something like that
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  You know, we live in a digital age now where anything that's connected to the internet can and will be hacked into
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  Your cell phones, your car, your smart TV, we've shown you time and time again for years now
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  That these kind of devices can be hacked into and the government will use them to spy on you and listen to
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  But with this, I see a little bit more evil things happening with something like this
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  Imagine your child's playing with the Hello Barbie and next thing you know someone hacks into it
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  Tells your child to walk outside and some yahoo pedophile comes driving down the road, scoops your kid up and kidnaps him
[03:33.000 --> 03:40.000]  Or your kid is sitting there playing in the living room and you just get off work with your wife
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  You're having a conversation, you guys are constitutionalists
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  And next thing you know, the government shows up and bangs down your door because it's been listening in via the Hello Barbie
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  You know, the government's already come out and said that they are more worried about constitutionalists as terrorists in our country
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  Than they are about these ISIS Islamic terrorists who are taking over Iraq
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  This doll has very bad implications and this is why I said it as a buyer beware
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  I am not a parent, but when I saw this article, I've seen numerous articles today reading about it
[04:11.000 --> 04:18.000]  The implications that this thing can have is just unsettling and makes me sick at my stomach
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  And anyone out there who has a child, who cares about someone, needs to share this video
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.000]  And make sure that this is not something that's going to be on any kind of wish list for a child
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  A birthday present, a Christmas coming up
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  We need to make sure that we spread this word and get it out there because
[04:36.000 --> 04:48.000]  You know, it wouldn't take that much for a malicious person to hack in via the Wi-Fi on that and have very rude, sick, disgusting conversations with your child
[04:48.000 --> 04:54.000]  They're saying, Mattel is saying that this is a very secure server and there's no chance of anything like this happening
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  But whenever someone says something like that, there's always a pretty good chance that something bad will happen
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  So we need to stop this now before it gets out of control, before it hits the shelves
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  Spread the word, don't buy the Hello Barbie because Big Sister is listening
[05:33.000 --> 05:43.000]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges
[05:43.000 --> 05:50.000]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality
[05:50.000 --> 05:59.000]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females

[08:08.000 --> 08:29.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  It's Alex Jones
[08:32.000 --> 08:49.000]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to think of joining us on this live, original Monday, the 23rd day of February, 2015 Global Broadcast
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we'll be here for the next three hours
[08:52.000 --> 09:04.000]  Daniel Estelin, Bilderberg's sleuths, got the latest on what really happened at Davos, what's coming up in 2015 in June on the agenda for Bilderberg, 2015, and about his new documentary that's coming out
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  He'll be joining us for 30 minutes, start of the next hour
[09:07.000 --> 09:21.000]  Then, always informative, we're going to be joined by one of the top preparedness global trends experts out there, Joel Scousen will be joining us to look at different global and domestic developments as well
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.000]  So please stay with us today, this is a broadcast you're not going to want to miss, quite frankly you don't want to miss any of the broadcasts
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  But this one particularly is going to be jam-packed and I'm wound up because obviously I missed some days last week
[09:34.000 --> 09:44.000]  Here's what's coming up, coldest months on record, February 2015 could be among the top five ever in the United States
[09:44.000 --> 09:57.000]  That's right ladies and gentlemen, and this is from Mainstream News CBS, so, but it doesn't matter, the new National Geographic's coming out and it talks about the war on science
[09:57.000 --> 10:06.000]  And on the cover, we have the cover tweeted out at Real Alex Jones, it says that climate change is not real
[10:06.000 --> 10:17.000]  See, notice it's gone from global freezing to global warming, being man-made, anthropogenic, to now, we're just denying that climate ever changes
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  No, we've said the climate always changes, and the only constant is change
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  So notice their bait and switch, the war on science, climate change does not exist
[10:30.000 --> 10:38.000]  Vaccinations can lead to autism, we have the CDC's own top scientist as a whistleblower saying they were ordered to cover it up
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.000]  Genetically modified food is evil, no, we just said that a lot of it, you know, that kills the bugs that eat it also hurts humans' livers
[10:47.000 --> 10:55.000]  I mean they've had to recall Starlink corn and scores of other GMO crops that end up killing the farm animals that eat it
[10:55.000 --> 11:04.000]  Let's see, they're killing you being ignorant, oh my gosh, there's no problem with GMO, oh my gosh, these people don't believe that climate changes
[11:04.000 --> 11:16.000]  No, we said anthropogenic global warming is a hoax, and it's been proven to be one, but, see, I just read one headline out of no exaggeration
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  I've probably got, let's, 200 articles in front of me
[11:21.000 --> 11:32.000]  This is just one stack, look at this headline, Texas Governor, since January 1st, we've had more than 20,000 people come across the border illegally
[11:32.000 --> 11:39.000]  That's the new Texas Governor, Greg Abbott, told CBS's Face the Nation
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  Continuing, there's no economic and political freedom without economic freedom, again there's no political freedom without economic freedom
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  Economic freedom is the foundation of all freedom, that's Patrick Barron von Mises Institute, up on infowars.com
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  And that dovetails with this stack of news I'm going to get to
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.000]  Federal Reserve Insider, Alan Greenspan warns, there will be a quote, significant market event, something big is going to happen
[12:04.000 --> 12:13.000]  And what is that something big? Again, CBS News, four of ten Americans are one bill from disaster
[12:13.000 --> 12:21.000]  How are we such a great economy when that's the case? ABC News survey finds many Americans on the edge of financial disaster
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  But the controlled media, at least the politicians most of the time, say that the economy's never been better
[12:27.000 --> 12:36.000]  But then separately, more and more even establishment types are on television and in print saying yes, get ready for major economic collapse
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  And the globalists are pre-positioning themselves right now
[12:40.000 --> 12:50.000]  Meanwhile, CARE praises DHS report that came out last week during the terror summit, the extremist summit that extremist Muslims are not mentioned at
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  You cannot make that up
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  And so that right-wing extremists are the number one threat, we're going to be breaking that down
[12:57.000 --> 13:08.000]  The Council on American Islamic Relations has come out and praised the report, warning of libertarians, right-wingers, Christians, gun owner groups and veteran groups
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  They agree that's the main threat
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  This is like a satire novel or something
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  I mean, if I wrote a comedy novel about what's really going on, people buy it and laugh at it
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  But then they go, wait a minute, this is really going on
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  So that then dovetails with this stack of news
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  And remember the Kenyan mall shooting a few years ago that killed 60-plus people, what 69 people
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  And wounded a whole bunch of others
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  That was carried out by Boko Haram, which is an al-Qaeda-affiliated group
[13:41.000 --> 13:49.000]  And of course that then expands down all the way into the middle of Africa, into the west of Africa, in Nigeria, not just Kenya
[13:49.000 --> 13:58.000]  Well, when I first saw the threats coming out of this al-Qaeda ISIS group to attack Mall of America and other major malls
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  I pointed out yesterday, funny they said Mall of America
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  Because if you go to Minneapolis, St. Paul, and I've been to many times since GCN Radio Network is based there
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  It's based in between Minneapolis and St. Paul
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  Let's do Twin Cities
[14:15.000 --> 14:23.000]  Almost everybody at restaurants serving you, driving the taxi cabs at the hotels are Somali
[14:23.000 --> 14:31.000]  And there's a government program to bring in Somalis from Somalia as, quote, refugees
[14:31.000 --> 14:39.000]  And they're constantly getting caught, you know, it's a minority of them obviously, but cooking stuff up
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  But don't worry, there'll be no mention that unlimited illegal and legal immigration can cause a problem
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Even though ISIS is saying they're going to immigrate Europe and the US with sleeper cells
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  Because when they strike, they'll just have a summit and blame the Tea Party like Obama did last week
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  And the Council on American Islamic Relations will come out and praise it
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  They're not coming out and saying, hey, don't blame libertarians, don't use anti-terror laws to go after the American people
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  Just like we've said, don't use these laws to persecute Muslims
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  No, no, no, they're saying good job, get them, that's the bad guy
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  Right there, Alex Jones, Ron Paul
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  A video reporting, this is AP, to be by Somali Al-Qaeda-linked rebel group Al-Shabaab
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  Urged Muslims to attack shopping malls in the United States, Canada, Britain, and other Western countries
[15:27.000 --> 15:33.000]  US authorities said there was no credible evidence suggesting a US mall was in the works
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  Even though they said so, the threat by the Al-Qaeda affiliate came in the final minutes
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  A more than hour-long video released Saturday in which the extremists also warned Kenya
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.000]  Of more attacks like the September 2013 assault on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  And when it was 67, I said 69 people were killed
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  So this is Somali terror group that has attacked malls
[15:57.000 --> 16:05.000]  Is saying, and of course the same link group attacked the mall there in India
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  And it turned out the government knew about that and the head of the Indian anti-terror force tried to stop them
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  And he was killed hours before the attack was launched, probably by an inside job
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  So this is what's being hyped up, this is what's being prepared
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  And don't worry, when it happens, when Jared Erliners gets shot down by Stinger missiles
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  Given to Al-Qaeda and ISIS by our criminal government
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.000]  Obama will have a summit and they will blame veterans and gun owners and libertarians and Christians
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  That have the lowest crime rate of any group in the United States
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  Again, they had their two-day meeting last week and came out and said the main threat is basically white people
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  If you slip on a banana peel, white people did it
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  And again, this is all part of just the divide and conquer strategy
[16:50.000 --> 16:58.000]  And then they're turning the Middle East over to these radicals who then run around and kill non-radical Muslims
[16:58.000 --> 17:02.000]  So there you go, Somali extremist urge attacks on US shopping malls
[17:02.000 --> 17:10.000]  Minneapolis St. Paul is loaded with recent immigrants, immigrants from Somalia
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  Loaded, this is part of our government immigration program
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  Threat of attack, draw shrugs at North American malls, Reuters
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  Kenyan president Nairobi Siege makes comments on the malls
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  So that's just some of the news I've got on this front here
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  But I wanted to get into this article
[17:34.000 --> 17:45.000]  The terrifying rise of ISIS map shows how terror groups, tentacles, now reach from Algeria to Afghanistan
[17:45.000 --> 17:50.000]  And if you're watching at infowars.com forward slash show or prisonplanet.tv
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  You can see this or just go to the Daily Mail article
[17:53.000 --> 18:01.000]  They have an excellent map that shows them out of their Iraqi base given to them by the globalist by NATO five years ago
[18:01.000 --> 18:09.000]  Then launching attacks in Assyria, Jordan and Egypt
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.000]  As well as the West Bank, they're now attacking again Libya
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  They've taken the entire coastal area as well as Tripoli
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  And of course who cares about the rest, it's all just desert
[18:23.000 --> 18:33.000]  And now the same groups are spilling into Kenya and as far south and west as Nigeria
[18:33.000 --> 18:47.000]  And as far east as Afghanistan and it's all been resettled, re-upped, re-supplied by the West on record as the Syrian, the Free Syrian Army
[18:47.000 --> 18:53.000]  And they've now taken large swaths of Syria and Iraq as their new homeland
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  And then it says major ISIS stronghold is a black flag
[18:57.000 --> 19:04.000]  Areas in black are the roads and towns they fully control
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.000]  And of course that's the oil fields and oil pipelines as well
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  And there's no investigation of who's buying the oil from them
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  I mean the federal government says that if you give money to a charity that then gives money to some affiliated group
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  You can get life in prison even if you didn't know
[19:21.000 --> 19:27.000]  But then meanwhile the big oil companies are allowed to just sit there with their big ships at the Suez Canal and other areas
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  The Strait of Hormuz and load up on this oil that's come out of those pipelines
[19:31.000 --> 19:37.000]  This is so obviously the West and Saudi Arabia giving a funding mechanism to ISIS
[19:37.000 --> 19:43.000]  Who then launders the money they make back into western banks
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  So there you go and then when the terrorists attack they can take our freedoms
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  The government can grandstand and that's mission complete
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  That's how full spectrum dominance works
[19:54.000 --> 20:00.000]  You control the enemy, you control the response and you control the people you're supposedly protecting
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  All this and more, the rest of the story straight ahead
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  James O'Keefe says he's afraid for his life with his biggest story ever
[20:35.000 --> 20:44.000]  Hey there, guns80.com continues to surprise us with low prices and high quality ghost AR-15 rifle kits
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.000]  At guns80.com ghost AR-15 kits are an even better idea than buying at gun shows or through private parties
[20:49.000 --> 20:56.000]  Because the ghost AR-15 kits at guns80.com require no background checks, no registration, they don't even have serial numbers
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  That's what I call privacy
[20:58.000 --> 21:05.000]  But at guns80.com to order your ghost AR-15 rifle kit, no dealers, no hassles, ship direct, guns80.com or 8442 guns80
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  That's 844248 6780
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  As the new world order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  We're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  The answer is clear, get prepared and you get prepared now

[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  And celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month
[22:40.000 --> 22:46.000]  We're slashing prices on InfowarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality

[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com

[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  Or just go to DiscountNutritionShop.com
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  This is Dan Pilla, do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless case
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem
[23:59.000 --> 24:24.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, that's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com
[24:29.000 --> 24:42.000]  And specifically, he said that the ear of quantitative easing
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  And zero interest rate policies by the Fed
[24:45.000 --> 24:51.000]  That we really cannot exit this without some significant market event
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.000]  And by that I interpreted being either a stock market crash
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  Or a prolonged recession
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  Which would then engender another round of monetary reflation by the Fed
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  So he thinks something big is going to happen
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  That we cannot get out of this ear of money printing
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  Without some repercussions and pretty severe ones
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  That gold will benefit from
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  We're told the economy is so great
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  And again, Alan Greenspan has reportedly said a significant market event
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  Something big is going to happen
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  And then meanwhile, CBS News reports four of ten
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  Or four out of ten Americans are one bill from disaster
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  Almost four out of ten Americans are living on the edge of financial ruin
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  Given rainy day funds that either match or are lower than their credit card debt
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  About 24% have more credit card debt than emergency savings
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  One of the 13% had neither credit card debt nor emergency savings
[25:51.000 --> 25:57.000]  A new survey from bankrate.com found
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  While Americans have never been particularly great savers
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  That's not true
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  At least in recent decades
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  Many workers are finding it harder than ever to sock away money for emergencies
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  That's because wages have been stagnant or falling for most
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  The country's lowest paid workers are the only segment to seek significant pay gain last year
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  Thanks to minimum wage hikes, but because of inflation, that means nothing
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  People don't have enough money for unplanned expenses
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  And if they have more credit card debt than emergency savings
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.000]  It's a double whammy said bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  In the event of unplanned expenses, their options are limited
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  People between the ages of 30 and 49 are in the worst shape
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  They're supposed to be your top spenders, between 30 and 49, by the way, folks
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  That's the part of your life you spend the most
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  Which is likely due to financial stresses of that age group
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.000]  Such as saving or paying for their children's tuition and paying for higher expenses
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  Such as mortgages and childcare
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  Nevertheless, more Americans are in better shape this year than in 2014
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  The survey found
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  That's the total whitewash
[27:09.000 --> 27:15.000]  58% of workers have more emergency savings than credit card debt compared to 51% last year
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  One quarter of Americans also say they feel more secure in their jobs
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  And they're feeling better overall about their debt lows than any time since 2013
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  So folks are feeling good about being in record debt
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  And that is what a lot of the studies show
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.000]  Economically, people are not in good shape, but they feel optimistic
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  At least if you believe these major studies that are coming out
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  And it's the way they phrase the questions, but here's what we know
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  Here is what we know
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  100 million people plus, like 103 million
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  Are not in the workforce
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  Around 50 million are on food stamps
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.000]  They say 47 million, but if you count supplemental and other state type systems
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  It's more like 55 million are on food stamps
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  Never before has the debt versus savings ratio been higher across the board
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  And it's only intensifying
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  And then what you pay for, you don't get as much value for
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  Big example is education
[28:18.000 --> 28:24.000]  And I'm not here being a gloom and doomer, but they sell the idea that being positive
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  Will just make things better and create optimism in the economy
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  And that is the truth
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  If you already have a good economy and aren't a one crop system
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  But we don't have an industrial base, our service base is eroding
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  Our jobs are being transferred overseas faster than you can keep track of it
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.000]  And they're bringing in giant skilled, but also even larger unskilled immigrant groups
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  To debase and drive down wages
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  And it hurts every American and doesn't even end up helping the third world
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  There's a giant sucking sound worldwide, China's getting poorer
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  Mexico's getting poorer
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  India overall is getting poorer
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  It's not industrializing these countries
[29:11.000 --> 29:16.000]  It's not creating valuable jobs that pay them enough to build a middle class system
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  That creates stability
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.000]  Meanwhile, when we come back, Texas governor, since January 1st
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.000]  We've had more than 20,000 people come across the border, C&S News
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  That ties into the city of Austin website
[29:29.000 --> 29:32.000]  Austin welcoming city, sanctuary city
[29:32.000 --> 29:39.000]  We're gonna cover how they're basically paying to bring the illegal aliens in
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.000]  To then integrate them into the welfare system
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  And I'm gonna tie that into the CBS News headlines from last week
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  Border patrol ordered not to arrest drunk drivers if they're illegals
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.000]  In fact, reprint me that article please
[29:56.000 --> 29:58.000]  And the memos, they said it's not your fault if they kill somebody
[29:58.000 --> 30:02.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[30:02.000 --> 30:30.000]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day

[31:09.600 --> 31:13.280]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[31:13.280 --> 31:17.640]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.

[33:26.600 --> 33:31.560]  And if you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:31.560 --> 33:41.440]  We have the Trans-Pacific Partnerships and other global agreements right now being pushed
[33:41.440 --> 33:45.240]  through by stealth, they're completely secret.
[33:45.240 --> 33:49.800]  The public is not even allowed to see them, Congress is not allowed to see them, and they're
[33:49.800 --> 33:54.240]  trying to vote for fast track for the president where he doesn't ever have to make any of
[33:54.240 --> 33:55.240]  it public.
[33:55.240 --> 33:56.240]  Did you hear me?
[33:56.240 --> 34:01.040]  Meanwhile, we caught the government last year, and later the New York Times confirmed
[34:01.040 --> 34:06.680]  it, shipping the illegals in and paying for their bus vouchers, whether then shipped
[34:06.680 --> 34:15.000]  to sanctuary cities like Austin, Texas, in Chicago, Illinois, where the illegals are
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.320]  then basically given driver's license and allowed to vote.
[34:18.320 --> 34:26.040]  Do you remember the House and Senate of Illinois last year unanimously passed a bill to let,
[34:26.040 --> 34:32.480]  quote, anyone in the world come to Illinois and quote, vote?
[34:32.480 --> 34:34.040]  Why did the feds put up with this?
[34:34.040 --> 34:35.560]  Because the feds are behind it.
[34:35.560 --> 34:39.560]  We have a captured federal government.
[34:39.560 --> 34:42.480]  And they spend the whole thing like, well, you got to accept immigrants and give them
[34:42.480 --> 34:44.520]  free welfare and let them have their babies here.
[34:44.520 --> 34:49.520]  Remember CNN last week, Chinese women by the thousands a month, and now it's growing to
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.400]  the tens of thousands a month, save their money, fly here a month before they have their
[34:54.400 --> 34:59.880]  baby, check into a hotel, the baby gets citizenship, then they get citizenship, everything paid
[34:59.880 --> 35:05.160]  for, and then the husband is allowed to be brought in because they're now U.S. citizens,
[35:05.160 --> 35:08.360]  because the baby's a U.S. citizen.
[35:08.360 --> 35:12.040]  What was the headline from CNN?
[35:12.040 --> 35:20.240]  Here it is, why Chinese moms want American babies should be, you know, how American taxpayers
[35:20.240 --> 35:26.280]  are put on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
[35:26.280 --> 35:32.480]  Yeah, the average birth in the California hospital is $57,000.
[35:32.480 --> 35:40.040]  The LA Times reported last year, $57,000.
[35:40.040 --> 35:44.240]  If you went to China and said, I'm here to have my baby free, they'd arrest you.
[35:44.240 --> 35:46.800]  You go to Mexico and say, I'm here to have my baby free.
[35:46.800 --> 35:48.280]  They would laugh at you.
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.080]  Oh, you can have your baby, we're going to throw you in jail and protective services
[35:52.080 --> 35:54.160]  are going to take your kid and we're going to adopt it.
[35:54.160 --> 35:55.960]  Oh, but we're not racist.
[35:55.960 --> 36:00.080]  Oh, you're from China, you're from Mexico, you're from Nigeria.
[36:00.080 --> 36:04.400]  Come here and have your baby and we'll pay for it.
[36:04.400 --> 36:06.880]  Oh, you're Somalis.
[36:06.880 --> 36:11.840]  Oh, you say you want to come over here and blow up the shopping mall here, let us bring
[36:11.840 --> 36:17.200]  you in as part of a refugee program.
[36:17.200 --> 36:25.040]  Meanwhile, Texas governor, since January 1st, we've seen 20,000 people come across the
[36:25.040 --> 36:26.040]  border.
[36:26.040 --> 36:28.520]  We saw what happened on the Texas border last summer, but we need to understand that the
[36:28.520 --> 36:32.600]  problem is not going away to Governor Greg Abbott told CBS his face the nation with Bob
[36:32.600 --> 36:33.600]  Schaefer Sunday.
[36:33.600 --> 36:37.280]  Already this calendar year is January 1st, we've had more than 20,000 people come across
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.640]  the border apprehended unauthorized and so we have an ongoing problem on the border that
[36:41.640 --> 36:44.520]  Congress must step up to solve.
[36:44.520 --> 36:48.800]  The problem is Obama is down there.
[36:48.800 --> 36:55.040]  We know because the board patrol called us, we went and broke it in June of last year
[36:55.040 --> 36:58.160]  that they load them on the buses in McAllen and Brownsville and every other city.
[36:58.160 --> 36:59.160]  They give them vouchers.
[36:59.160 --> 37:04.320]  They give us the Democratic areas, Democratic cities, more than 80, there's 87 admitted
[37:04.320 --> 37:12.040]  sanctuary cities, Denver, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Chicago, New York City of all
[37:12.040 --> 37:19.600]  places, LA, and Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington and you get there, there's the
[37:19.600 --> 37:23.280]  headline, city official admits border patrol, fronting cash to busy legals anywhere in
[37:23.280 --> 37:25.480]  the U.S.
[37:25.480 --> 37:29.120]  And then once they get to the Catholic churches and the Protestant churches that they get
[37:29.120 --> 37:35.080]  federal money by the way, Democratic party homes get $7,000 a month per three people
[37:35.080 --> 37:38.320]  they house, then they sign them up for welfare.
[37:38.320 --> 37:41.160]  They start giving a cut of the welfare of the families as well.
[37:41.160 --> 37:47.560]  There are people I know all over Austin, lawyers, you name it, that shit on top of groups of
[37:47.560 --> 37:52.600]  hundreds of illegals and then demand basically more dito from them.
[37:52.600 --> 37:56.560]  They've had city council connected family members and city council arrested for baseball
[37:56.560 --> 38:00.360]  batting, you know, basements full of illegals.
[38:00.360 --> 38:04.200]  So, so this is an underclass being preyed on.
[38:04.200 --> 38:05.200]  Let's get that straight.
[38:05.200 --> 38:10.720]  I don't blame people in collapsing Latin America wanting to get up here and quite frankly,
[38:10.720 --> 38:16.880]  they have conservative values, but they're being indoctrinated and flipped and turned
[38:16.880 --> 38:21.960]  into operatives to vote to take the guns and to complete the takeover of this country.
[38:21.960 --> 38:27.560]  Their CBS news headline, Board of Patrol agents advised to release drunk drivers.
[38:27.560 --> 38:30.640]  The memo says it doesn't matter if they kill people, it's not your fault.
[38:30.640 --> 38:34.280]  Of course, common law and state and federal does say that's illegal.
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.640]  But don't worry, just Department memo by the same people that ship guns into Mexico to
[38:38.640 --> 38:40.680]  blame the Second Amendment.
[38:40.680 --> 38:45.880]  Do not detain.
[38:45.880 --> 38:54.480]  Do not detain and it just goes on to say if you release them in the memo and they kill
[38:54.480 --> 38:56.800]  somebody, you are free from liability.
[38:56.800 --> 38:58.520]  No, you're not.
[38:58.520 --> 39:03.640]  But see, this is the age of government just doing whatever it wants because a new Sherpa
[39:03.640 --> 39:07.800]  globalist foreign mega system is in control.
[39:07.800 --> 39:14.880]  Most of our laws are now written by the UN and then adopted outside of treaty by Fiat
[39:14.880 --> 39:21.720]  by local state and federal government under UNESCO treaties under Agenda 21 from 1992
[39:21.720 --> 39:29.360]  at the Rio conference under the Trans Pacific partnerships and the Pacific Union and the
[39:29.360 --> 39:36.960]  Asian Union and the North American Union, the Caribbean Union, all these interlocking systems.
[39:36.960 --> 39:42.060]  There's the headline judicial watch DHS orders Board of Patrol to stop drunk driving arrest,
[39:42.060 --> 39:44.640]  but to continue it for citizens.
[39:44.640 --> 39:51.240]  Now let's dovetail this open lawlessness, totally unfair, totally discriminatory as
[39:51.240 --> 39:55.800]  we're merged by stealth into the North American Union.
[39:55.800 --> 39:57.640]  I like Greg Abbott overall.
[39:57.640 --> 40:00.520]  I know folks that know him personally, they say he's the real deal.
[40:00.520 --> 40:02.640]  He's battled Obama shutting down our power plant.
[40:02.640 --> 40:05.280]  He's battled him on the open border.
[40:05.280 --> 40:10.240]  But Abbott needs to come after the cities like Austin, Texas, where he got inaugurated
[40:10.240 --> 40:15.080]  a few weeks ago and they shut down half of downtown.
[40:15.080 --> 40:16.680]  I've talked to people that have had dinner with Abbott.
[40:16.680 --> 40:19.680]  He knows the whole whole show.
[40:19.680 --> 40:21.200]  He knows the New World Order.
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.320]  He knows what's going on.
[40:25.320 --> 40:27.040]  But Abbott you need to talk about this.
[40:27.040 --> 40:31.120]  Look at this headline from Austin, Texas dot gov.
[40:31.120 --> 40:35.120]  Austin promotes immigrant friendly welcoming environment.
[40:35.120 --> 40:40.560]  Austin hospitable reputation proceeds itself once again with its new initiative designed
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.400]  to ease the transition to life in Austin for international newcomers.
[40:45.400 --> 40:46.680]  They're not even called migrants.
[40:46.680 --> 40:50.840]  They're just called international newcomers.
[40:50.840 --> 40:53.160]  But if you come from a wealthy Western country, let's just say it.
[40:53.160 --> 40:55.040]  It's discriminatory towards whites.
[40:55.040 --> 40:59.880]  They will throw the book at you and you can't get your Ukrainian bride and like one caller
[40:59.880 --> 41:06.560]  talked about, you can't get here with your PhD from South Africa if you're white.
[41:06.560 --> 41:11.360]  But if you are from a third world country and you're white with no skills, you can get
[41:11.360 --> 41:12.360]  in.
[41:12.360 --> 41:14.480]  If you're from a Latin American country with no skills, you can get in.
[41:14.480 --> 41:18.280]  If you're from Africa or Asia with no skills, you can get in.
[41:18.280 --> 41:19.880]  It is wide open.
[41:19.880 --> 41:25.280]  If you're destitute a pregnant mother with two kids who got here on a train, baby, you're
[41:25.280 --> 41:27.920]  golden.
[41:27.920 --> 41:31.320]  Now there is an event today in Demara at the Palmer Event Center.
[41:31.320 --> 41:37.560]  It's totally free.
[41:37.560 --> 41:39.160]  Listen to this headline.
[41:39.160 --> 41:43.240]  Welcoming America, a national grassroots-driven collaborative, yeah, by the Ford Foundation
[41:43.240 --> 41:49.360]  and the Feds, works to promote mutual respect and cooperation in communities to help immigrants,
[41:49.360 --> 41:52.560]  they're already told by them to use the word illegal alien and we all do what they say,
[41:52.560 --> 41:55.200]  into a social fabric of their adopted hometowns.
[41:55.200 --> 42:03.000]  Oh, it's their hometown now and has also been recognized as a 2013 Clinton Global Initiative
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.840]  Commitment to Action.
[42:04.840 --> 42:05.840]  Global Initiative.
[42:05.840 --> 42:08.600]  That's under agenda 21, United Nations Treaty.
[42:08.600 --> 42:09.600]  See that?
[42:09.600 --> 42:11.200]  That is you in.
[42:11.200 --> 42:18.520]  Austin's immigrant population is a key driver of economic prosperity.
[42:18.520 --> 42:22.360]  Really, look how economic prosperous this country is.
[42:22.360 --> 42:24.280]  This country is collapsing.
[42:24.280 --> 42:31.320]  And as an asset to our entire community, said Natalie Bevitz, or Betz, the city of
[42:31.320 --> 42:35.400]  Austin is acting International Economic Development Program Manager.
[42:35.400 --> 42:40.560]  They have a program manager to literally give free food and board and welfare to the illegals.
[42:40.560 --> 42:45.680]  It is, quote, imperative for our continued success that new immigrants feel welcome.
[42:45.680 --> 42:47.480]  That's right.
[42:47.480 --> 42:50.880]  Just like they make you feel welcome in other third-world countries when you go down there.
[42:50.880 --> 42:56.000]  But at home in Austin, and I'm thrilled to be joining this national initiative to learn
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.120]  new welcoming strategies for our communities.
[42:58.120 --> 43:01.240]  That means how to give them all the welfare, all the free goodies, how to sign them up
[43:01.240 --> 43:02.600]  for everything.
[43:02.600 --> 43:07.920]  Welcoming cities and counties, affiliates, will share promising practices with each other
[43:07.920 --> 43:14.840]  and serve as a model to help communities across the nation learn from their local level innovations
[43:14.840 --> 43:19.440]  that support economic development and create vibrant global economies, communities that
[43:19.440 --> 43:22.040]  are great places to live, work, and do business.
[43:22.040 --> 43:25.600]  Now, I'm going to get into what they're doing at this event and who runs it in the cities
[43:25.600 --> 43:28.440]  that are part of this, uh, unionization.
[43:28.440 --> 43:32.080]  Schwarzenegger said five years ago when the Copenhagen Treaty failed for global carbon
[43:32.080 --> 43:35.640]  taxes, he said, it doesn't matter.
[43:35.640 --> 43:39.520]  I'm going to head up the global communities and you should have local towns and cities
[43:39.520 --> 43:43.800]  implement Agenda 21 and the program.
[43:43.800 --> 43:49.400]  And then billionaires like him get city initiative money to build these dormitories that are
[43:49.400 --> 43:55.520]  240 square feet under UN treaty where they then house the illegals and pay for everything
[43:55.520 --> 44:01.160]  for them to displace American workers, drive down wages as we just broke down four out
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.320]  of 10 Americans or one bill from disaster.
[44:04.320 --> 44:07.760]  This is pure economic warfare by the ruling class.
[44:07.760 --> 44:12.120]  We've had professors on to break this down.
[44:12.120 --> 44:18.920]  The one from UC Davis to go over all this.
[44:18.920 --> 44:24.840]  And just the headlines, poor and illegal alien prison riot leave Texas facility and ruins.
[44:24.840 --> 44:25.840]  Unbelievable.
[44:25.840 --> 44:30.160]  McAllen, Texas, 2000 inmates riot at South Texas prison.
[44:30.160 --> 44:33.280]  I mean, it is on inmates to be transferred after riot.
[44:33.280 --> 44:37.680]  I mean, and that's just where they're holding 2000 of the aggravated felons.
[44:37.680 --> 44:39.600]  They just released everybody else.
[44:39.600 --> 44:45.440]  I mean, this is implosion level.
[44:45.440 --> 44:51.440]  So they're just doing it, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Austin, Texas, Baltimore, Maryland.
[44:51.440 --> 44:55.600]  This is part of this UN initiative under the Clintons, Boise, Idaho, Chicago, Illinois,
[44:55.600 --> 45:01.160]  Columbus, Ohio, Dayton, Ohio, High Point, North Carolina, Lincoln, Nebraska, Macomb County,
[45:01.160 --> 45:06.000]  Michigan, Montgomery County, Maryland, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, St. Louis, Missouri, St. Louis,
[45:06.000 --> 45:07.000]  Missouri County.
[45:07.000 --> 45:08.160]  And that's just this issue.
[45:08.160 --> 45:10.600]  There's 80 plus sanctuary cities.
[45:10.600 --> 45:13.080]  Now, let's go into all the free goodies.
[45:13.080 --> 45:19.240]  Because remember the headline last week, Obama will give illegals day one, a tax refund,
[45:19.240 --> 45:24.320]  even if they've just gotten here one day before AP reported illegals.
[45:24.320 --> 45:29.480]  The banks with no ID give them home loans because it's all there because the illegals
[45:29.480 --> 45:30.480]  are perfect.
[45:30.480 --> 45:36.280]  They'll work and get a welfare check, the perfect worker.
[45:36.280 --> 45:41.640]  So because you can't live on the welfare and you can't live on the minimum wage, the illegals
[45:41.640 --> 45:46.040]  come from really hardcore, serious countries and they'll work hard, but they'll also gain
[45:46.040 --> 45:47.680]  the system.
[45:47.680 --> 45:51.760]  And the Ford Foundation, these welcoming committees train them how to do it.
[45:51.760 --> 45:55.800]  They're not like lazy, poor whites or poor blacks on average.
[45:55.800 --> 45:59.200]  We've got the numbers who will just welfare and lay there in a slum.
[45:59.200 --> 46:01.040]  The illegals want a new Chevy truck.
[46:01.040 --> 46:02.680]  They want to go on vacations.
[46:02.680 --> 46:05.480]  They want to go to nice restaurants, especially the Latin American ones.
[46:05.480 --> 46:09.640]  So they'll work two jobs and pull a welfare check.
[46:09.640 --> 46:13.240]  And they'll vote and they'll become CPS workers, even when they're illegals.
[46:13.240 --> 46:15.160]  They'll become sheriff's deputies, even when they're illegals.
[46:15.160 --> 46:16.160]  Look it up.
[46:16.160 --> 46:20.200]  AP reported that a lot of illegals are now sheriff's deputies.
[46:20.200 --> 46:24.880]  And now California in just one week after the law went into effect, 59,000 immigrants
[46:24.880 --> 46:27.920]  with driver's license in the first month.
[46:27.920 --> 46:33.080]  You read deeper though in the AP article, that was actually numbers from the first week.
[46:33.080 --> 46:36.840]  Game over.
[46:36.840 --> 46:41.800]  The globalists have conquered every nation they want and they're conquering us now.
[46:41.800 --> 46:48.280]  And the thing is, 80% or 81% of the immigrants are from Latin America.
[46:48.280 --> 46:50.600]  That's the favorite group.
[46:50.600 --> 46:55.000]  And again, they've killed any type of race consciousness or culture consciousness in
[46:55.000 --> 46:56.280]  any other group.
[46:56.280 --> 46:59.920]  But with the Latin Americans, they hype it and push it because other folks can't hear
[46:59.920 --> 47:01.480]  it because it's another language.
[47:01.480 --> 47:03.280]  It's perfectly under the radar.
[47:03.280 --> 47:09.600]  You drive by and see billboards saying Lariconquista, La Raza, it means the race, the reconquering.
[47:09.600 --> 47:15.200]  You've got immigrant groups from South America saying, I have migrant rights as an indigenous.
[47:15.200 --> 47:19.720]  All this stuff taught out of the universities.
[47:19.720 --> 47:21.600]  So it's not like they're just going to come up here and work.
[47:21.600 --> 47:26.280]  They are becoming vehement collectivists, vehement communists, and being funded by
[47:26.280 --> 47:27.280]  the billionaires.
[47:27.280 --> 47:28.280]  Why is that?
[47:28.280 --> 47:30.520]  Because this is the political takedown game.
[47:30.520 --> 47:34.040]  Because the billionaires are offshore tax exempt, they don't go under this.
[47:34.040 --> 47:38.760]  But if you are a black American, a Hispanic American, a white American, an Asian American,
[47:38.760 --> 47:43.920]  a purple, polka-dotted American, a bright green American, I don't care what color your
[47:43.920 --> 47:46.560]  melanin is or where you came from.
[47:46.560 --> 47:50.360]  If you're a citizen or you're playing by the rules, they will screw you over a thousand
[47:50.360 --> 47:51.360]  different ways.
[47:51.360 --> 47:57.160]  And the Democratic Party has an entire infrastructure like Acorn, Battleground, Texas and all the
[47:57.160 --> 48:03.600]  rest of it, and that's who's involved in this, to radicalize and form these people into
[48:03.600 --> 48:09.920]  a cohesive block and to also milk them, milk them.
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.760]  So this is a gang takeover.
[48:14.760 --> 48:21.960]  And the article continues, registration, this is today, Monday, February 23, 2015.
[48:21.960 --> 48:28.880]  Registration, networking and continental breakfast, general admission, free.
[48:28.880 --> 48:33.080]  And they go on, it's recommended that you leave room, be nice for the immigrants, so
[48:33.080 --> 48:35.800]  basically don't come if you're not a legal alien.
[48:35.800 --> 48:40.120]  Well, we're going to go down there and cover it, but our guys are going down there today.
[48:40.120 --> 48:43.880]  I want a crew to go in one hour.
[48:43.880 --> 48:47.480]  Registration, networking and continental breakfast, networking.
[48:47.480 --> 48:50.200]  First you identify any troublemakers, that's the networking.
[48:50.200 --> 48:52.240]  The change agents go around.
[48:52.240 --> 48:57.760]  Austin's multicultural demographic landscape, that's 9 to 10, that was last hour.
[48:57.760 --> 49:02.240]  The economic value of immigration in our community, yeah, look at the country falling apart.
[49:02.240 --> 49:05.760]  Not immigration is good if they're hard working and don't get welfare, but when you do, it
[49:05.760 --> 49:07.240]  brings the country down.
[49:07.240 --> 49:12.760]  Breakout, after lunch, the Texas League, executive action in the future potential of
[49:12.760 --> 49:16.520]  immigration reform, total legalization, it's already been done by Fiat.
[49:16.520 --> 49:19.520]  Breakout too, career pathways for new Americans.
[49:19.520 --> 49:23.280]  You don't need to get citizenship, you just are, because you're a Democrat, you're a
[49:23.280 --> 49:30.200]  socialist, you're a globalist, planary, best practices in immigration, integration.
[49:30.200 --> 49:36.400]  All meals will be provided free of charge except for your own lunch on February 23rd,
[49:36.400 --> 49:37.400]  2015.
[49:37.400 --> 49:41.680]  Please note that there is an $8 parking fee at the Palmer Events Center and if you have
[49:41.680 --> 49:49.600]  questions, please contact Connie Gonzales, Connie.Gonzales at austintexas.gov or her
[49:49.600 --> 49:50.600]  phone number.
[49:50.600 --> 49:56.200]  Two weeks advance notice will allow us to provide seamless access.
[49:56.200 --> 49:58.240]  Where is the governor on this, Abbott?
[49:58.240 --> 50:00.520]  I mean, you want the illegals?
[50:00.520 --> 50:05.920]  They're right there being, it's fraud to put illegal on welfare, it's fraud to help somebody
[50:05.920 --> 50:10.120]  with false IDs, but it's all just done right out in front of everybody and I guarantee
[50:10.120 --> 50:13.840]  you, when we send our reporters down there, they're going to have reluctant cops down
[50:13.840 --> 50:17.880]  there getting in our face acting like we're criminals because we are criminals.
[50:17.880 --> 50:21.840]  When criminals take over, those that aren't criminals are the enemy.
[50:21.840 --> 50:23.360]  What did George Arwell say?
[50:23.360 --> 50:30.080]  In a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[50:30.080 --> 50:33.520]  And when you live in a tyranny, if you lived in Nazi Germany and you were against the Nazis,
[50:33.520 --> 50:34.680]  you'd be called insane.
[50:34.680 --> 50:38.960]  This is America being conquered by global corporations that are doing this all over
[50:38.960 --> 50:45.000]  the world, flooding.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.480]  So there you go.
[50:48.480 --> 50:53.120]  Now if you're a social worker learning how to help the illegals, you've got to pay ten
[50:53.120 --> 50:57.800]  dollars to go though, so that if you're an illegal, you're in like Flynn, absolutely
[50:57.800 --> 50:58.800]  free.
[50:58.800 --> 51:02.960]  U.S. border agents in Tucson area told the let drunk drivers go free, see I mean it's
[51:02.960 --> 51:07.320]  just, but meanwhile in Australia, national security, we're going to break this down and
[51:07.320 --> 51:09.320]  we come back.
[51:38.320 --> 51:39.800]  Harvest Right.
[51:39.800 --> 51:43.720]  The makers of the only in-home freeze dryer would like to present to you their greenhouses
[51:43.720 --> 51:45.920]  that double as emergency shelters.
[51:45.920 --> 51:47.840]  Their greenhouses simply snap together.
[51:47.840 --> 51:48.960]  No tools needed.
[51:48.960 --> 51:51.440]  As a greenhouse, it will stand for decades.
[51:51.440 --> 51:56.280]  It's incredibly strong, long lasting and it can be quickly put up or taken down.
[51:56.280 --> 51:59.320]  It is also ideal when used as an emergency shelter.
[51:59.320 --> 52:03.440]  Learn more about this great greenhouse and the money you can save over the big box store
[52:03.440 --> 52:06.240]  prices at HarvestRight.com.
[52:06.240 --> 52:08.840]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[52:08.840 --> 52:13.880]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotsSupply.
[52:13.880 --> 52:17.520]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[52:17.520 --> 52:21.400]  direction this country was headed and the charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick
[52:21.400 --> 52:22.400]  buck.
[52:22.400 --> 52:26.480]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[52:26.480 --> 52:30.560]  MyPatriotsSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[52:30.560 --> 52:34.160]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employees.
[52:34.160 --> 52:39.120]  Two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women.
[52:39.120 --> 52:42.360]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[52:42.360 --> 52:47.680]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storeable foods from MyPatriotsSupply.
[52:47.680 --> 52:53.400]  Go to MyPatriotsSupply.com slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage

[53:05.000 --> 53:08.560]  MyPatriotsSupply.com slash Alex.
[53:08.560 --> 53:09.680]  It's happening again.
[53:09.680 --> 53:13.280]  The feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[53:13.280 --> 53:19.040]  In January, a newly introduced bill, HR 378, will take away your right to buy level three
[53:19.040 --> 53:20.960]  in a higher body armor.
[53:20.960 --> 53:26.600]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level three body armor packages on the market today.
[53:26.600 --> 53:27.600]  Protect yourself.
[53:27.600 --> 53:30.560]  Buy your body armor now before it's too late.
[53:30.560 --> 53:34.760]  Go to KatieArmor.com as C-A-T-I-Armor.com.
[53:34.760 --> 53:37.760]  Come and take it.
[53:37.760 --> 53:41.560]  I am a 47-year-old female and had a heart attack in 2005.
[53:41.560 --> 53:44.440]  This is Alice from New Jersey.
[53:44.440 --> 53:47.640]  I still get angina even with four stints.
[53:47.640 --> 53:50.640]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[53:50.640 --> 53:55.680]  The very first day after taking heart and body extract, the chest pain was gone.
[53:55.680 --> 53:57.800]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.
[53:57.800 --> 54:02.200]  Even the secrets have an effective, natural, 100% organic nutritional supplement for a
[54:02.200 --> 54:14.440]  healthy heart and circulation at HBExtract.com.
[54:14.440 --> 54:16.720]  I was a highway man.
[54:16.720 --> 54:21.280]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[54:21.280 --> 54:26.400]  With sword and pistol by my side.
[54:26.400 --> 54:32.360]  Many a young man lost her bobbles to my trade.
[54:32.360 --> 54:38.000]  Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade.
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.400]  The Masters hung me in the spring of 2005.
[54:43.400 --> 54:50.000]  But I am still alive.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.600]  I was a sailor.
[54:52.600 --> 54:56.280]  By the way, folks, Rob Dewey, our news director, heard me talking about the Clinton
[54:56.280 --> 54:58.960]  initiative and saying that was a U.N. program.
[54:58.960 --> 55:06.360]  So he went to the Welcome to America website, the city of Austin, links to in the Global
[55:06.360 --> 55:11.160]  Welcoming Initiative, and it is an international innovation award, a partnership between the
[55:11.160 --> 55:17.400]  United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and BMW Group.
[55:17.400 --> 55:21.040]  So BMW is helping finance that.
[55:21.040 --> 55:25.520]  It's also here has the Carnegie Endowment.
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.760]  It's always the same people.
[55:30.760 --> 55:31.760]  Newman's own foundation.
[55:31.760 --> 55:36.920]  Yeah, when you buy Paul Newman stuff, it's going to open the borders up, bring people
[55:36.920 --> 55:40.800]  in and give them free goodies to break the country.
[55:40.800 --> 55:44.680]  And look, they give people like Paul Newman to sign on to this before he died, believing
[55:44.680 --> 55:46.080]  he's helping poor immigrants.
[55:46.080 --> 55:47.480]  That's not what's going on.
[55:47.480 --> 55:51.880]  They use all these well-meaning people about, yes, we're Christians, let's bring the poor
[55:51.880 --> 55:56.320]  Latin American children in and give them everything free as the national debt hits
[55:56.320 --> 55:57.520]  almost 19 trillion.
[55:57.520 --> 56:03.680]  I mean, this is designed to, people go to their mainline Methodist churches now that
[56:03.680 --> 56:08.760]  are begging for money and then it goes to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[56:08.760 --> 56:11.840]  They're just sucking money off all these well-meaning people.
[56:11.840 --> 56:13.440]  It's totally sick.
[56:13.440 --> 56:17.720]  And then America will collapse into a third world slum like everywhere else, and the globalists
[56:17.720 --> 56:22.400]  will live in Monte Carlo, Luxembourg, or Switzerland, which do not allow this.
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.400]  And by the way, they're making Australia a safe haven for elites right now.
[56:27.400 --> 56:31.840]  They just voted out carbon taxes, London Guardian.
[56:31.840 --> 56:37.840]  National security, Abbott would revoke, not our Abbott, but the leader of Australia, would
[56:37.840 --> 56:42.600]  revoke citizenship as part of extremism fight, urges Muslim leaders to proclaim Islam as
[56:42.600 --> 56:47.160]  a religion of peace more often and mean it, and says, if you engage or try to plan terrorism
[56:47.160 --> 56:50.760]  whenever citizenship revoked, absolutely.
[56:50.760 --> 56:55.920]  If you're not a born citizen and you commit a terrorist act, ship your butt out.
[56:55.920 --> 56:59.720]  Don't kill each other on some desert island.
[56:59.720 --> 57:03.960]  I tell you, if they repeal their gun laws that they passed 20 years in Australia, it's
[57:03.960 --> 57:06.240]  looking better and better.
[57:06.240 --> 57:07.680]  That's another thing, folks.
[57:07.680 --> 57:09.600]  I'm not trying to run from all the immigrants.
[57:09.600 --> 57:14.160]  I'm trying to run from the globalist organizing them into an army of ignorance, a perfect
[57:14.160 --> 57:18.920]  group that doesn't speak English, that are all Balkanized in their own little slum-controlled
[57:18.920 --> 57:23.160]  areas run by the big community organizer, Ford Foundation, UN Garbage.
[57:23.160 --> 57:27.480]  I mean, this is global governance conquering sovereign nations and conquering the free
[57:27.480 --> 57:28.960]  market right now.
[57:28.960 --> 57:34.200]  This is the global elite that made their money in the robber baron age 150 years ago, pulling
[57:34.200 --> 57:38.880]  up the ladder so the rest of us can't get wealthy.
[57:38.880 --> 57:43.560]  They're teaching you get wealthy by working the system or being on welfare.
[57:43.560 --> 57:47.120]  Before I go any further, it is essential to spread the word about this broadcast.
[57:47.120 --> 57:48.720]  That's why we're growing by leaps and bounds.

[59:29.040 --> 59:32.720]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[59:32.720 --> 59:37.080]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[59:37.080 --> 59:39.080]  Can you put two and two together?
[59:39.080 --> 59:44.680]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and.308 sniper rounds, is reasonably

[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:15.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.880]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.040]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.880]  John McCain and Corker say, court case, not DHS funding is the best way to resolve Obama's
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.880]  executive amnesty.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.400]  That means they know the court case will fail, not having Congress exercise its power over
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.400]  the purse.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.160]  They don't want that precedent set.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:52.440]  They're there to undermine separation of powers and the continuity of our republic.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:57.880]  Our country's been overrun by a bunch of usurpers who are busy trying to end the libertarian
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:02.640]  conservative voting bloc's attempt to block the world government takeover of the United
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.320]  States, not just the rest of the planet.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.360]  Daniel Estelen will be joining us from Europe via video Skype, with big news on Davos, the
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.440]  upcoming Bilderberg agenda.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.040]  Some believe that they found the 2015 location, in fact, print me that article if you can.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.360]  I think it was a Steve Watson article, location 2015 found, Bilderberg, I think I'll pull
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.360]  it up.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.680]  We're going to get into that with Estelen up until the bottom of the hour.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.200]  Then more on the fresh nuclear leak detected at Fukushima plant.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.240]  Coldest months on record, February 2015, could be among the top five in recorded history.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.120]  James O'Keefe, we're going to try to get him on ASAP, folks.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.160]  I'm afraid for my life, journalists set to release bombshell story.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.160]  He's released.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:54.440]  Let's exaggerate about five or six number one news stories in the U.S. that have brought
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.960]  down multi-billion dollar criminal operations like Acorn.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.840]  He's been arrested, I think about four times.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.160]  They tried to indict him.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.960]  So he's not a guy that cries wolf.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.520]  He's not the boy that cries wolf.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.320]  If he says he's afraid for his life for this story, he better release it now.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:24.040]  Because Breitbart said he had the white whale, the big enchilada, the big one, and he was
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.760]  dead in a hammer.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.160]  I wonder if O'Keefe dies real quick.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.640]  They'll just say, oh, he had heart problems is no big deal.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.160]  I have been physically attacked.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.760]  I have been death-threaded.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.040]  I have been trying to cover a military operation in Florida, and man, they just green light
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.040]  at the craziest stuff.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.200]  They're like in our hotel room, they had some guy jump out of the bushes and just start
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.720]  setting fires going, okay, Alex, I'll follow your orders to set fires.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:52.080]  And I had to put the fires out and get them to the start of physical altercation.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.080]  I pushed the guy down.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.680]  I said, listen, you may think you're tough, because I knew he was a former, obviously
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.920]  current military, but sheep debt had been following us around.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.240]  I said, I'm about to hurt you, man.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.240]  I said, you may think you're going to get out of this, but I mean, you're not going
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.240]  to set a fire in my name.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.280]  So he ran off into the woods, never saw him again.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.120]  He'd been at Waco shadowing us.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.360]  Mike Hansen saw all this happen, and he was a sheep dip type.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.560]  They always infiltrate those guys, and they think you won't know their military when they
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:26.880]  got all the bearing and all the activity and are giving signals to the military or tracking.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.880]  They'll send these little bitty guys, like, you know, like five, four, because I had them
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.120]  one other time, send one of those in on us, and they just think that you won't recognize
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.480]  their special forces when they send the little, little ones in.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480]  Those are the worst.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.840]  And I mean, I've just dealt with stuff people wouldn't believe.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.920]  And we went through all that word about it, spread in the military.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.880]  And I was told by Colonel in the army about five years after all that happened.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.480]  He said, man, you are a legend in special forces.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.160]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.040]  And they go chasing the helicopters and putting guns to your head or it was actually a Mike's
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.240]  chest, but that the story changed a gun to my head.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.240]  It wasn't my head.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.680]  They said, turn that camera off in San Antonio.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.240]  We had the police chief throw them out.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.240]  So we were down there two weeks later.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.240]  They got real mad.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240]  They still did the drill and we got word.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.320]  So the MP sticks a gun to Hanson's chest.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.240]  We wouldn't give them the camera.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.720]  And Hanson was unbelievable.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.200]  The problem is they took our tapes and erased them and then gave them back to us.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.880]  But they all know it's true.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.600]  So that's why they, but that stuff then got exaggerated and all the stories got told to
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.600]  us where they'd be doing these secret maneuvers because I was down there at Kingsville, San
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:42.320]  Antonio, our reporters, auxiliary listeners were in Maryland, Alabama.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320]  We made films.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.520]  There's video of this, Florida, LA.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.840]  And so the special forces started thinking it was me, but it was my listeners with cameras
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840]  everywhere.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:57.800]  And so I was like this boogeyman that was popping up during their drills, but it's funny how
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.720]  legends work.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.880]  But in fact, they still sometimes think I'm out there and I haven't done that in probably
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.880]  eight years.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.880]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880]  Stay with us.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:12.400]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:19.800]  What if we the patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.240]  and individual empowerment?
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.600]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.920]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.240]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.960]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers and the rest of the
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.960]  garbage.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.880]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[51:51.380 --> 01:08:47.040]  one of the only living people who has connections into the Bilderberg group.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.720]  I get some intel from people on the periphery, but I do not have a source directly inside
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.480]  Bilderberg.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:58.840]  But much of what they would cover at Bilderberg previously in secret is now rolled out publicly
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.680]  at Davos each year.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.760]  Daniel Estolin has written several international bestsellers on the Bilderberg group.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.920]  He's also written a thinly veiled fiction that, of course, really isn't fiction at a
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:20.000]  lot of levels, just like Ian Fleming's James Bond novels were true stories put into a composite.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.720]  And he now has released a documentary we're going to be telling you about today.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.560]  He joins us till 30 after, longer if you'd like.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:36.720]  He's an author, public speaker, Daniel Estolin.com, E-S-T-U-L-I-N.com, and his latest book is The
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.280]  Octopus Deception.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:43.040]  And he joins us now to break down world government.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.560]  We've gone from 15 years ago, mainstream media said it didn't exist.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:51.960]  Now global governments here, presidents in Italy are appointed because they're Goldman
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.760]  Sachs presidents.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.720]  We see leaders appointed in other countries.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.760]  We are now going into the technocratic era, and that, of course, is a statement out of
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.080]  Bilderberg six, seven years ago and from Davos last year.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.640]  So really, they're coming out in the open.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.320]  They're dissolving borders.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.000]  They're passing global treaties without ratification.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.360]  The text of the treaties are secret.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:20.480]  Things are moving into high gear, and at the bottom of the rat hole is transhumanism.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.720]  And Daniel will break that down.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.920]  I want to look at the conflict with Russia.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.840]  I want to look at what's happening in Europe, what's happening in Greece, standing up to
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.600]  Germany, at least on the surface.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:36.160]  Daniel Estolin joins us via video Skype to give us a rundown on the latest unfolding
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.920]  worldwide.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:45.080]  He also published his second book, released in 2006, described by Fidel Castro as a fantastic
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.080]  story.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.200]  Castro wanted to meet him, so he went to Cuba to meet him.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.520]  Estolin is not a communist, by the way, but I'd meet with Castro if he wanted to meet
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.520]  with him.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.440]  He's very influential, because his analysis is cutting edge.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.520]  And I happen to know who one of his Bilderberg sources is, by the way, through Hollywood
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.520]  Connections.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:10.280]  So I know Estolin's for real, and his intel continues to come out and to be accurate year
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280]  after year.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.640]  So he's got the big scoop on where it may be held this year.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.880]  Is it accurate, as some are saying, that it's going to be in Austria and a lot more?
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.400]  Daniel, thank you for joining us.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.600]  Alex, it's always a great, enormous pleasure for me to be on the show.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:32.040]  You and I go way back in 2006, we had, together, standing right in front of a Bilderberg hotel
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.520]  in Kanada, Ottawa, when you were arrested, if you remember, of course you remember.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.520]  Yes.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.020]  Just before you came to Canada.
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.200]  And so we've been doing this for a long, long time.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.960]  And of course, Jim Tucker was with us, he's no longer with us, but there's a lot of people
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.080]  out there who are doing what they can to make sure that this story doesn't die.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.600]  And again, this global awareness, which you were talking about before, on the world stage,
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.480]  people are becoming aware more and more what's going on as a result of technological revolution,
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.160]  internet and everything else out there.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.920]  It's getting more and more difficult for the global elite to hide their deeds.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.040]  And as you said, we do have the sources.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.520]  And I'm very glad you didn't actually give out the source we have to Hollywood because
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.560]  these are some very, very influential and useful people for our cause.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.000]  Well, sure, I mean, of course, I'm not going to get into it, but I wasn't giving out a
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.640]  secret for those that know, but sure, but not just one of your sources, but I'm just
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.320]  confirming that there's some inside baseball for folks out there that know what we're talking
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.320]  about.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:35.080]  Daniel, continuing, looking at what's happening, why do you think they're coming show out
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.080]  in the open?
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.600]  And then you've got the floor because I got to ask questions, but I want to know what's
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.600]  on your mind.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.600]  The latest intel you've gotten.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:47.040]  Well, the Bilderberg meeting is being held actually in 2015 in Austin, on my Twitter account
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:52.440]  at Estrel and Daniel, I published a couple of months ago, an information, a report that
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.960]  I got from my intel sources in the Ministry of the Interior of Austria, who sent me the
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.600]  report saying which dates that everybody in Austria has to be on the lookout.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.040]  There is no holidays that week.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.640]  I believe it's from the 9th, I can't remember exactly the date right now, but it's the beginning
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.320]  of June and it is being held in Austria and we have the documents to demonstrate it.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.800]  As far as what's going on in the world, the global is to lead, the reason actually all
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.440]  this information is coming out right now, it is that the global leader faced with the
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.760]  reality of seeking to dominate populations that are increasingly becoming self-aware,
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.440]  now developing a global consciousness.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:32.160]  Thus, a population being subjected to domination in Africa, for example, has the ability to
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.960]  become aware of a population being subjected to the same forms of domination in the Middle
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.040]  East, in South America, or in Asia, or even in Europe, in Greece, for example.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:47.680]  And they can recognize that they're all being dominated by the same global power structures.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.840]  And that is the key point, not only is the awakening global in its reach, but also in
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:53.840]  its nature.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:59.080]  It creates within the individual an awareness of the global condition, so it is a global
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:04.240]  awakening both on the external environment and also in the internal psychology, and this
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.880]  is something that the elitists such as the Bilderbergers, the Trilateral Commission, Council
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:17.240]  for Relations, Penite Circle, Bohemian Grove, all this ONGs, Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie's,
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:24.000]  Hudson's and Hoover's, they simply can't deal with it right now because it's a new game.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.120]  And this new reality in the world comes with the fact that the world's population has never
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.600]  been so vast, presents a challenge to elites seeking to dominate people all over the world
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:41.600]  who are aware and awaken to the realities of social inequality, to war, poverty, exploitation,
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.720]  disrespect, imperialism, and domination.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:51.440]  And of course, this directly implies that these populations will be significantly more
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:56.720]  challenging to control both economically, politically, socially, psychologically, and
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.720]  also spiritually.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:05.640]  Simply amazing, you know, when I interviewed you for Endgame eight, nine years ago, you
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:10.240]  talked about at the bottom of the rabbit hole is eugenics, is transhumanism, that they don't
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.520]  need human populations anymore in large numbers.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.880]  The decision has been made not to build a world where humans go to space and where we
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:23.720]  have human dignity, but where humans don't have dignity, so that we expect to be basically
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.560]  reclamated, destroyed, phased out.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.840]  What's the latest intel in that area?
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:33.280]  What's the latest that happened behind the scenes at Davos?
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.400]  And what's going to be on the agenda if you know so far at the coming meeting in a few
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.960]  months there in Austria?
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:45.840]  Well, I think, you know, as we've talked about, I think it was six or seven months ago, my
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.880]  last book in the United States is actually called Trans Evolution, the Coming Age of
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:56.440]  Human Deconstruction, and in that book, basically, I explained, and you've been following this
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.040]  and you've been talking about this, I think, longer than anybody in the world.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.400]  You brought this people's attention, long before you decided to write this book, Trans
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:08.600]  Evolution, that, you know, we're living through this greatest paradigm change in the history
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:14.040]  of the human, you know, planet Earth, of human society, and the changes we're seeing right
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:19.160]  now over the very short period of time into the future, you know, are so paramount that
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.120]  they will forever change the very face of humanity.
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.600]  For example, those of us who have children who are today are six, seven, eight years
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:32.480]  old, you know, this is, you could pretty much safely say that this is the last 100% human
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.280]  generation of people on the planet Earth.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.560]  Our grandchildren, they will not be human, they'll be transhuman, they'll be post-human,
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:44.200]  they'll be men machines, they'll be cyborgs, they'll be beings who are not totally human
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.400]  as a result of incredible revolution, synthetic biology.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:52.360]  So again, we've seen this change from human to transhuman to post-human, and this change
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:57.800]  is going to lead to a completely different state of a human being into a near future.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.440]  And again, we're talking about progress and technological development, which the elites
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.200]  are using for their own advantage.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.480]  Because again, the point is, if using technology to increase the power of men of a nature,
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.480]  that's an amazing thing.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.480]  It's a positive thing.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.400]  But if you're using technology to subjugate, that's a lot more than we already have subjugated
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.160]  because there's a lot more people, it's a small planet with limited natural resources.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:27.080]  So you have 1% against 99% for the Rockefellers of this world to eat.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.080]  Most of us have to die.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.880]  I mean, you've talked about this ad nauseam in your documentaries, and I was honored actually
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.880]  to participate in one of them.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.880]  Well, we're honored to have you, Daniel.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.840]  We're going to talk about your documentary here in a moment, skip this network break,
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:41.600]  because all the time we have with you, so precious, but expanding on that, the way you
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.320]  quantify it in your latest book, which was just excellent research and material, I learned
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:51.560]  a lot of reading it, is we've got to put that out there that that's the choice.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:55.600]  They're building a world to get rid of us where we don't exist.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.200]  That's the global architecture.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.040]  That's what the social engineers are going for now.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.760]  50 years ago, there was a debate about it.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.280]  Now that group has taken control.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.480]  That's why things are moving so quickly.
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:12.400]  People need to know the future of our world has been decided if we let these people run
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400]  things.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.800]  If the population is aware of their program, then all of this deindustrialization, all
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.520]  of this dehumanization will then make perfect sense and we can stop it.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:28.280]  I mean, Daniel, I don't see how they can get their program if you and I and countless others
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.280]  are exposing it.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:34.440]  And like you said, 20 years ago, no one was talking about this.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:39.200]  Now this is becoming very, very mainstream, and I don't see how they're going to sell
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.040]  the idea of something so monstrous.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.760]  Well, a great example, and I think the greatest living example is Detroit.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:52.360]  I mean, if you want to talk about deindustrialization, zero growth, demand destruction, all you need
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.760]  to do is look at Detroit.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.480]  This was the engine of economic growth and industrial might in the United States for
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.480]  the past half a century.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.880]  Today, it looks like something you see in a Will Smith zombie post-apocalyptic film.
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.120]  And of course, people who live in the United States, who live in Detroit, who live in Michigan,
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:15.640]  who live anywhere and who are aware of what's going on in Detroit, have to understand that
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.160]  this is a prototype for the globalist elite for the rest of the world.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:22.280]  They want the rest of the world, and you've talked about this, I think, again, longer
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:26.360]  than anybody I know, they want the rest of the world to look like Detroit, London to
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:30.560]  look like Detroit, Paris to look like Detroit, Moscow to look like Detroit.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.760]  And if you kind of look at Europe, I mean, Greece already looks like Detroit, Portugal
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:40.680]  looks like Detroit, in Spain, you have 70% youth under 30 unemployed, Italy is up and
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.880]  arms, half of the country from round down, it's pretty much unemployed, anywhere you
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:52.840]  go, the world is up and arms, South America, Southeast Asia, Canada, Africa, these places,
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.720]  this is what deindustrialization looks like.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.720]  And again, if people are wondering why the elite are doing this, progress and development
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.240]  is directly proportional to population density.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.800]  So if you have progress, you have technological development and industrial development, you're
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.820]  gonna have more wealth, more money, greater families, which means you're gonna have more
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.320]  mouths to feed.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.920]  And so for the rock of fellas of this world to eat, we have to die, it's really that simple,
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:22.520]  there's simply not enough food, there's not space for now, but there's not enough food.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.960]  So which is why on the one hand, what they're doing, and I talk about this in trans evolution
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.440]  and you pointed out to me very well, this is exactly what they're doing, on the one
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.000]  hand, they're destroying the world's economy on purpose, the elite, but on the other hand,
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.080]  they're using their gazillions of their money to actually invest in this incredible futuristic
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:44.840]  technology, which will make this divide between their power over the rest of humanity greater
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.840]  than ever.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:50.800]  By the way, we're rolling some background footage of your new film and I tell you, it
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:56.000]  looks like better than something you'd see on HBO, the camera work, the research, I cannot
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.240]  wait to see this, tell us about your new documentary, Daniel, and how soon we can get a copy of
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.240]  it.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:08.240]  I'd love to sell it on DVD or Blu-ray once it comes out at my store, but I hope it goes
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.240]  in theaters first.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:14.280]  Tell people the name, tell us all about this incredible documentary on the Bilderberg group
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.280]  that you produced.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.640]  Well, we actually, we're in a post-production now, the film comes out at the end of May
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:24.240]  beginning of June, we've been at it for about four years, it's our production, we've
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:29.200]  done interviews in 11 countries, Canada, the United States, most of Europe, we've traveled
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.440]  up and down all over the place.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.240]  The first producer of the documentary was actually wiped out economically, if you believe in
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.880]  conspiracy or creative coincidence theories, won three banks, called in loans on the same
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:45.160]  day and that's basically bankrupted him, so we actually have to go and buy it.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:49.680]  And by the way, I separately know about this, not from you, but I know who the group was.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.040]  Are we allowed to say who they were or we shouldn't talk about it?
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.000]  You can if you want, exactly.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.720]  Is that the guys with the Halsey Young group?
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:02.800]  No, no, no, the Halsey Young group, that's the major motion picture.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.760]  Yeah, that's the folks that made Terminator that they also came after them and took them
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.240]  over to stop your film getting mad, right?
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:14.280]  Yeah, these are other people who are producing the documentary, these are the people in Spain,
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.280]  independent producers, people who-
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.440]  So this has happened twice then if I'm correct?
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:22.080]  This happened twice, once with the commercial motion picture and now with the documentary,
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.680]  which is why it took us a bit longer, but it's almost with the post-production stages.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.600]  I tell a little anecdote, I sent a letter, an email to Martin Wolf, the Pulitzer Prize
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.800]  winning journalist with the Financial Times, and I asked him for an interview and I got
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.640]  a reply and of course we're gonna put it in the documentary.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:41.960]  He sent an email, how dare you make a documentary about the build of a group?
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:47.200]  So the documentary is coming out of the beginning of June, end of May, we're in the post-production
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.640]  and we're very, very close to the finish line.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.720]  We're gonna be over that finish line and the film is gonna be out.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:58.720]  Worldwide release, there's a lot of international, large film festivals, we're very interested.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.400]  And also Bilderberg has become a household name, the book came out 10 years ago and now
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:08.080]  everybody knows about it and I think this is the time, it's the right time socially speaking
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:13.080]  with all the changes taking place in the world, that people think finally are ready to embrace
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:18.160]  this concept that you've been talking about for about over a decade and I've been talking
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.160]  about it for over a decade.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:25.160]  So you've got Nigel Farage in here, you've got just an amazing list of top people in
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:29.760]  your film, I cannot wait to see this, what's the name of the film?
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.160]  It's called The True Story of the Bilderberg Group, it's based obviously on my book, it's
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:37.920]  actually the first documentary which is based on a book, most documentaries you know are
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.440]  not based on books, but this one is based on my book, The True Story of the Bilderberg,
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:47.320]  I get it's gonna be out in theaters end of May, beginning of June and when it's out
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.360]  needless to say I'd be more than happy and pleased to go back on your show and talk
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.360]  about it.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:57.080]  Incredible, well I'm thinking about going to Austria, I'll just give them a heads up
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:02.320]  like I did in England, they had British intelligence domestically, they're waiting for me when
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.440]  I got off the plane to have a little talk with me and then I had to meet with the local
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.080]  multi-county group, but they ended up being pretty nice and helping us out and ended up
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:14.600]  not liking the Bilderberg group too much, but I am gonna give the Germans and the Austrians
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.760]  a heads up then I'm coming, I know it's two different countries, but the two work closely
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.760]  together.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.480]  I wonder what reception I'll get in Austria, how do you expect them to treat the press
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.480]  Daniel?
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:29.280]  Not very well, it's you know, if you talk about Jagdburt, this is you know the epitome
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.680]  of Jagdburt, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, I mean you pretty much, you know these are,
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:40.880]  if you wanna talk about you know, Soviet Gulag, this is the European, you know, German, Austrian
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.920]  and Swiss version of the Soviet Gulag modified and either you live over there and you lived
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:50.040]  in Russia and Spain and everywhere else and in Canada, so I know you're internationally
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:53.600]  you know traveled, so I don't know, I haven't been to Austria yet.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.360]  I know it's kind of a paradox though because the British ended up really hating Bilderberg
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:02.680]  and agreeing with me, the police off record and I mean a bunch of them and you had police
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:06.400]  buying me beer and stuff when they would, you know, see me at the pub down the street
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.480]  getting dinner, so that was pretty amazing and then when we had our reporters in Switzerland
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:16.440]  a few years ago, at first the police were real mean but later they were escorting members
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:21.720]  of the local canton into the meeting, getting in the face of Bilderberg and they panicked
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.840]  and had jet coppers taking off at night, which I know you know about, so what do you make
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:30.440]  of kind of this awakening even by local government to Bilderberg?
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.840]  Well you know I can tell you that in 2011, Mario Burgessio was European parliamentarian,
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:40.160]  he was actually punched out by the Swiss police and he spent a couple of nights in
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.160]  the hospital.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:46.880]  Yeah, this is exactly, this is a member of the European parliament and then you know
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.760]  I have to explain to Mario Burgessio, I said Mario, Switzerland is not Europe, Switzerland
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:54.440]  is Switzerland, it's like another planet, it has nothing to do with Europe, so him coming
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:26:01.240]  in with his European member of the European parliament pass makes absolutely no difference
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:07.280]  because literally like walking into a closed up gulag and Austria I fear is gonna be pretty
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.560]  much the same thing.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.520]  It's a small country, it's a peepsqueak nation and needed to say they have unresolved childhood
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.360]  issues which they haven't been able to deal with since the Hitlerite base.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.400]  Are you gonna be there?
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.280]  I'm certainly gonna try, it all depends on the documentary if it comes out, I may not
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.080]  be able to maybe promoting the film but if I'm not, I'm certainly gonna be there.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.640]  If you're interested after the entry I'm gonna send you the documents I received from my
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.240]  sources you're more than welcome to post them on your site from the Ministry of the Interior
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:41.360]  of Austrian Secret Service explaining about the builder community to the people in the
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.640]  ministry so that they're aware which days they can and cannot take off, you know, leaves
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640]  of absence.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.920]  Incredible, well I can't wait to see your film, it just looks like a smash hit and you
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.640]  know Snowden's new film Citizen Four won an Oscar for best documentary, that's why they're
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.040]  so scared and said how dare you, they know that you're really trying to make, you know,
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:06.000]  full budget professional powerful film and I just can't wait to see you in the last four
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.520]  years working on this to get this out, DanielLesteland.com, in closing, I know you've got sources,
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.960]  I know a lot of it now is pretty much as you said last time you were on is put out at Davos
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:20.480]  but what's on the agenda for 2015 in Switzerland or in Austria?
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:25.280]  One of the key issues Alex is fiscal austerity, you know this Boogeyman term is back, it's
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.640]  kind of vague term that is, you know, actually refers to cutting social spending and increasing
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:34.720]  taxes and the effect this has is that the public sector is devastated as all assets
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.000]  of privatized public workers, you know, are fired and mass unemployment becomes rapid,
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.360]  health and education disappear, taxes rise dramatically and currencies are devalued to
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.560]  make all assets cheaper for international corporations and banks to buy up while internally
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:52.800]  causing inflation, dramatically increasing the cost of fuel and food.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:58.680]  In the short, fiscal austerity implies social destruction as we're seeing right now in Greece,
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.640]  as we saw in Spain, as we saw in Portugal and as we're seeing, you know, in Italy and
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.800]  you know, the social destruction of the social foundations of nations and people are pulled
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.000]  out from under them, staged them become despotic and oppressed and people will naturally revolt
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.680]  against austerity and this is called the sterilization of society and this is the term again, this
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:25.080]  is the term Alex, you're going to be seeing a lot more, you know, with the build up to
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:28.880]  Builderberg and then post Builderberg, we talked about this before, you know, terms
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.080]  like deindustrialization, zero growth, demand destruction, you know, they were discussed
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:37.320]  of these private secret meetings and then suddenly they were front and center major
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.320]  newspapers.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.120]  Next big front and center newspaper piece is sterilization of society.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.920]  It sounds awful, just the world's sterilization itself with all the connotations.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:51.600]  It's not sterilizing society, it takes on a meaning of its own and takes it, you know,
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:58.240]  to an nth degree, you know, of evil that needless to say we have to make sure we fight this.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:02.720]  When they say sterilization, do they mean sterilization physically, which we know is
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.720]  part of their agenda, population reduction, or does it mean kill upward mobility, stagnate,
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:13.720]  make people poor and basically create a class society in the name of collectivism?
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:17.680]  It's more meaning austerity.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.240]  So austerity is, for example, the West, the middle class will vanish in obscurity as they
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.680]  will be absorbed into the lower labor oriented working class.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.000]  The youth of the Western middle class comprising the majority of the educated youth will be
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.360]  exposed to a poverty of expectations in which they grew up in a world in which they were
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.000]  promised everything, in which these kids played by the rules and which, you know, they got
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.760]  nothing from society.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.120]  I tell you what, Daniel, I don't want to cut you off, I know you got to go, but do five
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:45.120]  more minutes with us if you can.

[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:52.040]  So thank you so much on what their agenda is straight ahead and then we'll cover world
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.280]  news and economic news after he leaves us.
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.280]  More with DanielEstlin.

[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:02.160]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:11.960]  Alex Jones and the G.C.N. radio network, used since before the days of the Roman Empire
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:16.480]  to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health, introducing the new

[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:27.160]  key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.160]  promote health.

[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:44.520]  ingredients extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules you

[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:52.560]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.120]  powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:31:00.160]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:15.240]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day, big heart shaped boxes filled with delicious
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.240]  candy.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:20.680]  What if we the patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.080]  and individual empowerment?
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.480]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:25.760]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.160]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:32.560]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers and the rest of garbage.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:36.760]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.600]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.160]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:36.440]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.640]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.240]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.240]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.760]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:49.000]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.560]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.080]  Electrally, it's begun.
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.080]  You can fail it.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:19.520]  Careful what you wish, you just might get it.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:23.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:35.520]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.280]  Daniel was kind enough to hold over the five-ten minutes because he was kind enough to send
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.280]  over a list of topics he'd like to get into.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.280]  And of course, I never brought any of them up.
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.280]  So I want to go over this with him quickly.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.080]  Greece's economic meltdown and bailout.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.520]  What's the real story?
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:53.440]  Could Europe be the new Japan, Putin, Russia, and Ukraine war?
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:54.440]  Results of Davos Summit.
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.040]  We kind of hit on that.
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.880]  70th anniversary of Yalta Conference.
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:02.520]  Daniel was invited to give a keynote speech for the Russian government.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520]  That's a big deal.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:10.400]  That's when Stalin Churchill and, of course, the U.S. president at the time he died shortly
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.600]  after Roosevelt all met.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.520]  The post-world plan was set up.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.320]  Copenhagen terrorist attack.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:28.160]  We already talked about trans-evolution, trans-humanism, but he joins us right now from Europe.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.160]  Daniel continuing.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.160]  Let's run through what's in store in the agenda and then these points.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.920]  Maybe we just touch on a couple of things.
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:42.200]  One is Russia, Ukraine, and the other is the situation with the issues because it all kind
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:46.200]  of ties in with what's happening in the, you know, with the industrialization, et cetera.
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:50.760]  I think it's fairly obvious when we're talking about the whole issue between Russia and the
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.000]  United States and NATO.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  It's not Ukraine.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.600]  It's the determination of governments that are under the thumb of the London Wall Street
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.160]  financial oligarchy to crush and sovereign opposition to that power.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:07.320]  And the powerful nations committed to defending national sovereignty, especially Russian China,
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.720]  are thus de facto their enemies.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.320]  And any lies necessarily to justify that this, you know, this designation will be and are
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:16.320]  being used.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.560]  And the truth is being overwhelmed by a torrent of lies about Russian aggression, you know,
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:26.680]  suppressing the real story of the coup d'etat in Ukraine, the Nazi nature of the coup plotters
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:27.680]  themselves.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:32.280]  And also this strategic intentions, you know, behind the plot, and we're seeing that, and
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:38.160]  it's amazing how easily the Americans can be confused and lied to and accept, you know,
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.840]  the propaganda of the White House and the Western elite.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:48.080]  That's right, Copenhagen terrorist attack, what do you think is going on there?
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:53.280]  Well, you know, if you kind of go back, Alex, to, you know, I don't know if you remember
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.800]  back in 2005, the famous politicking cartoons.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:05.840]  These are the first, you know, Mohammed cartoons which were released in 2005 by this Dutch Danish
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:09.400]  story newspaper called JT Politiken.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:14.440]  So out of the guys that we speak, this newspaper, you know, they published a dozen provocative
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:18.360]  anti-Islamic cartoons, clearly designed to offend the Muslims.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:26.280]  I've seen this again with Charlie Hebdo, we're seeing it right now, what's going on in Denmark.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:31.840]  You know, but if you kind of look at what's going on, all these characters, whether it's
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.400]  Sarkozy's, Cheney's, Rumsfeld, Netanyahu's, Jack Strauss, Obama's, Bush's, all of these
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:42.400]  people that marching to the, you know, martial music of the neocons, that the shock troops
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:47.000]  of the clash of civilizations, project for New American Century, the long war, clean
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  break.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.440]  All these other neocons, plots, conspiracies and contrivances.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:55.880]  And once again, the question is, who benefits, you know, entrance to the equation?
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:00.360]  Muslims, you know, they may burn off some of the outrage of what they see as denigration,
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:01.480]  you know, of the religion.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:06.120]  But the end of the day, the Straussian, you know, Habotinsky-Leek, with that coalition,
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:10.760]  this course, some very big propaganda points, and once again, people in America and Europe
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:16.760]  who must be periodically reminded of the necessity for this clash of civilizations, agenda for
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:21.800]  the total war, I'm sensed by the violence, spreading across the Middle East, and I convinced
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:27.280]  that all Muslims are crazed fanatics, who must ultimately be dealt with and put to death.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.880]  And so when you kind of look at it from that perspective, you ask yourself, you know, who
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:31.880]  wins?
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:32.880]  Well, this is the situation.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:41.000]  And then going back, putting all these things, you know, from a bird's eye view into perspective,
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.560]  you know, ISIS, Ukraine, denuclearization in America, what's going on?
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.440]  Well, we know, we all know what ISIS is, but, you know, with this fingertip control of the
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:53.680]  world's oil supplies, ISIS is holding the economies in hand, the governments of Western
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.480]  Europe and Japan hostage to the same policy, and with its networks of mullahs and kooks
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.640]  distributed throughout the Middle East, it is threatening the Arab world with the hell
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:07.760]  of more Iran, you know, if Arab governments do not play along with the Islamic card and
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.080]  seize their aspirations for industrial development.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:16.040]  But again, these people are not new, ISIS, we saw this with Muslim brothers going back
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.880]  seven years, it's the same thing as Al Qaeda.
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.840]  This is a very old strategy for at least 150 years, Alex.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:27.760]  It has been the strategy of the British and the Anglo Americans to make use of the religious
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.920]  and tribal backwardness of the nations of the near Middle East and Central Asia in order
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:37.680]  to control the people of the area and to maintain them in a state of underdevelopment.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:43.000]  It has recently become obvious, you know, that we've seen years back in the 1990s with
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.480]  Big New Brzezinski's book, you know, it has been solved on the idea that the Muslim fundamentalists,
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:53.420]  if properly guided, can be useful toy, you know, for the Anglo-American strategies of
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:57.400]  bulwark against anything that has to do with progress and development.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:02.560]  And what's amazing about listening to you, Daniel Estolin, is that you're quoting here
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:07.400]  from Brzezinski's book, you're quoting from the Grand Chess Board, you're quoting from
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:11.240]  the great game that the British talked about in India where they would play different Indian
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.400]  tribes off against each other.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:19.240]  How could you have one British on average conquer over 2,000 Indians with just a few thousand?
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.520]  It was using sociology to play different groups off.
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:27.000]  And so the globalists fund the radical Muslims, turn them loose, so it is a real issue.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.040]  It is disgusting what they're doing.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.960]  But then they open the borders, bring them in, let them attack, then take our liberties,
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:37.680]  and then go and take over and kill the innocent Muslims en masse.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:44.000]  This is the globalist manipulating all sides against each other, and then writing books
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.960]  about their grand strategy.
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.320]  And the public needs to wake up to this and needs to understand it, Daniel.
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.520]  Folks can follow you on Twitter.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:56.760]  What's the best Twitter account for them to follow you at?
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.280]  It's at Estolin, Daniel.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.920]  Also, as I said, the documentary is just about to be done.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.080]  And I don't know if I mentioned, I don't think I did.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.640]  But I was recently nominated for Nobel Peace Prize for all the work I have done over the
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.960]  years in fighting this globalist elite.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:15.480]  So again, I think there's a lot of recognition being done and made on the world stage, not
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:19.640]  only for the things that I do, but also for this, again, for this change of consciousness
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:25.320]  in our society, which is going towards this greater collective good, which is actually
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:30.640]  what we need to watch we defeat these people, defeat the leaders, and have a better future
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.280]  for our children.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.280]  Well said.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.280]  God bless you.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:35.280]  Thank you so much, Daniel.
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.280]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.800]  So much for being on your show.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.800]  Absolutely.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:44.040]  Again, Daniel's books have sold number one bestseller in more than 15 countries.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:46.040]  And a lot of Americans wouldn't know who he is.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.800]  A lot of folks in Europe and Asia know who he is.
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:55.520]  It just shows how many great people there are out there fighting tyranny.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:56.720]  And he's taken action.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:59.120]  He's got a film coming out.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.120]  That makes me feel good.
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.120]  No one.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.720]  There's more people out there fighting, not just myself or our listeners.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:07.320]  We're going to talk about James O'Keeffe says he's afraid for his life.
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:09.280]  Journalists set to release bombshell story.
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.760]  What could it be?
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.760]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to put out another report looking at, you know, perhaps what it
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:16.760]  could be.
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:22.760]  We're calling O'Keeffe right now, trying to get him on today or tomorrow.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:31.960]  And, you know, advising him that he needs to just release the story because he's never
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.240]  hyped something that didn't end up being bombshell and he's never talked like this before.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:38.200]  So I think he may be in real danger.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:41.840]  Believe me, folks, I've been death threaded more times than you can imagine.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.920]  And I've had a lot of serious dirty tricks pulled on me.
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:51.800]  And let me tell you that the system will resort to dirty tricks.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.080]  He's been arrested.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.120]  They've threatened to indict him.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.920]  He brought down Acron.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:03.800]  He's done so many other big things and they just don't like knowing he's out there.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.600]  They don't like knowing we're out there or Daniel Estlund's out there.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:13.320]  Jim Tucker got shot at in Portugal.
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:15.040]  All sorts of other dirty tricks they pull.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.880]  And I'm not up there saying, oh, you know, aren't we cool?
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:18.880]  We're such heroes.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:25.720]  I'm just breaking down the fact that once you get involved in this at this level, it's
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:31.200]  not fun, but it's very rewarding and a spiritual level to know that you're affecting change.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:36.760]  And it's also very frustrating because then you understand, wow, good people really could
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.200]  take back the world.
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:42.800]  We really could defeat evil and corruption, but we just give the world to the establishment
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:48.000]  and act like we have no power.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:53.600]  Now before I get into this news and a bunch of other news that I've not gotten to yet
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:43:03.000]  here today ahead of Joel Scowles and the editor of World Affairs Brief joining us, I wanted
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:10.440]  to just briefly tell you about some things that if you will take action and actually
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:16.200]  use them, I believe, because it's done that for me, will change your life.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:22.880]  We have gravity-fed G2, super high quality, the entire family of filters and accessories
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:32.480]  for the Pro 1, Pro Pure, G2.0 filters that takes out the fluoride, everything, the glyphosate,
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:33.640]  you name it.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:38.160]  We also have the clearly filtered systems that are excellent as well, but less expensive.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:44.040]  We also have the gravity-fed tabletop filters that are very affordable and very easy to
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.760]  use.
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.160]  These are all stainless steel units.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.720]  When you talk about Pro Pure, we have the other least expensive systems that are not
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:55.840]  stainless steel, but it's all there.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:59.840]  The globalists are really hitting us with all the toxins that are in the water.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.000]  There by accident, they're on purpose.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.640]  The weed killer runoffs, the pesticides, the mercury, the arsenic, the hydrofluorosic acid,
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.440]  different fluoride breakdown derivatives.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:13.360]  It is a no-brainer to start filtering your water today.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.680]  You get one for work, get one for home, if your kids are going up to college, give it
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:24.800]  to them and say, listen, I'll help you out with your car payment in six months if you
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:29.360]  commit to me that you're just going to drink water out of this filter system.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:35.880]  Changing our lifestyle one day at a time is the way to go.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:37.320]  You can do it over time.
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:39.960]  You can do it effectively.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:46.760]  That's what I want to challenge people to do today, is to take action, is to get involved,
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.520]  and also financially support this operation.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:56.160]  When you go to infowarstore.com and you buy a pro-gun or pro-liberty anti-tyranny t-shirt,
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.160]  they're great designs.
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:03.760]  We've got a whole Made in America section.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:07.960]  When you support us, you fund everything we're doing.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.960]  I know you know that consciously, but I need that to sink in.
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.120]  Some months it's hard for us to keep operating.
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:20.160]  Some months we have fat times, I'm able to expand something or fund a trip or fund some
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:24.000]  investigative journalism, but we need the funds to cover Bilderberg.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.200]  We need the funds to cover different events around the world.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:30.360]  We need the funds to keep these reporters and maybe get a few extras so we're not stretched
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:34.400]  thin and the writers and researchers and the folks behind the scenes and the folks that
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.320]  make this whole operation possible.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:45.840]  So again, infowarstore.com, in a couple days we end the special 15% off promo code WATER

[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:56.360]  we have.

[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.960]  Now let me get into James O'Keefe story then we'll go to break, come back with the coldest
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.240]  months on record what that means to the global warming fraudsters but here's the article
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:09.040]  up on infowars.com with his tweet, we have a story we're going to release this week,
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:13.160]  this coming week and I've never thought about this before but I'm afraid for my life on
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:19.280]  this one, conservative filmmaker James O'Keefe is about to release a bombshell story that
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:27.400]  has the journalist fearing for his life, Paul Joseph Watson article, infowars.com, we have
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:30.680]  a story, we're going to release this coming week, I've never thought about this before
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:35.760]  but I'm afraid for my life on this one, O'Keefe tweeted Saturday, whatever its nature the
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:39.840]  story promises to be a big one given the impact generated by O'Keefe's previous work and
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:45.400]  O7 O'Keefe poses a donor wanting to give money to Planned Parenthood to pay for the
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.040]  abortion of black and other minority babies, workers in numerous Planned Parenthood clinics
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.080]  agreed to accept the donations on the terms and shittingly at creaminess in their voiceless,
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:04.160]  oh yes, oh the black ones, yes, O'Keefe's biggest scalp was undoubtedly as 2009 takedown
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:08.760]  of Acurn an advocacy organization for people on low income, hidden camera footage published
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:15.200]  by O'Keefe showed Acurn employees giving advice on how to evade detection for tax evasion,
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:19.240]  human smuggling of child prostitution, Congress voted to eliminate federal funding for Acurn
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:26.440]  as a result of the expose, we can bring down these other groups folks, in August of 2014
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:31.520]  O'Keefe demonstrated the poorest state of the U.S. border when he crossed an unguarded
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:35.560]  footbridge in the upper Rio Grande while dressed as Helen Bin Laden and see we need to send
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.760]  our reporters in just to sit there today and just to listen at these meetings are having
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:46.240]  an Austin with this Austin welcomes UN funded program where they hand out all the free goodies
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.120]  and tell the illegals how to get all the welfare.
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:53.040]  For O'Keefe's sake let's hope that this doesn't end up like Andrew Breitbart, the conservative
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:58.320]  journalist who weeks before his untimely death on March 1st 2012 promised to release devastating
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:02.760]  video footage of President Obama, wait till they see what happens March 1st Breitbart told
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.480]  an audience in Washington D.C. and of course he was dead we'll be right back stay with

[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:20.360]  he was ordered to stay away from a fellow student cutting him off from his housing his campus
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:25.080]  job and educational opportunity all because he reminded her of a man who had raped her

[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:47.400]  he slightly resembles a perpetrator and going from an innocent man to people who are definitely
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:52.080]  guilty but were able to continue their crimes because of political correctness about fourteen
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:57.680]  hundred roderham children sexually exploited over sixteen year period the uncompromising
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:02.800]  report on events in south yorkshire town between nineteen ninety seven and two thousand thirteen
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:07.160]  said and more than a third of these cases the youngsters were already known to child
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:12.080]  protective agencies the report said by far the majority of the perpetrators were described
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:17.400]  as asian by the victim but the investigator said counselors seem to think it was a one
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:22.960]  off problem they hoped would go away and several staff described their nervousness about identifying
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:28.520]  the ethnic origins of the perpetrators for fear of being thought racist political correctness
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:33.560]  allow these rapists to run wild in the roderham streets now let me be very clear i'm not saying
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:37.680]  all asians or rapists or muslims or anything like that it was these particular men who
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:41.160]  just so happened to be asian but they didn't want to come down on these guys they didn't
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:45.080]  want to go round them up because of their ethnic origin and these are the type of political
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:49.640]  correctness things we see in our societies and allow guilty people to get away with their

[02:02:53.520 --> 02:03:04.160]  it is total mind control it is total basket case brainwashing to where she claims somebody
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.960]  raped her when she was in another state this is what's taught on all the campuses that
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:15.680]  the male acts of sex with a female is inherently right but babies are parasites inside women
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:21.920]  it's anti-human garbage to create some bizarre phobia where women's only identity is in hating
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:30.320]  men when we all know the happiest women out there are with loving men and vice versa and
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:36.760]  so many brainwash feminists have been reformed and actually found the love of a good man
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:41.360]  that serves them they serve him they have children they become empowered so many women
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.080]  have sent me letters and i've met them and they go oh my god i wish i'd have known this
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:50.480]  when i was younger my parents just raised me that the state was god and that my identity
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:57.840]  was in hating men and they have families with the last wave feminism where the man teaches
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:06.480]  them how fundamentally bad men are we are the species you don't say a male lion is bad
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:14.160]  it is the species humanity isn't a man or a woman or a child a boy or a girl i mean
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:22.240]  i love my daughters and i i want to put them in martial arts we're planning to do that
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:28.720]  now they've gotten old enough seven and ten and my son has been in it and i've been teaching
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:35.640]  him how to use the two older ones firearms and i don't i mean it's just this you are
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:40.240]  oppressing women you are a white male you are a and then oh my gosh he can't be in many
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:44.280]  areas of the campus it's basically kicked out of half the school because you slightly
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:50.360]  resemble and then jacar even qualifies by saying we're very sorry if you got raped lady which
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:53.960]  i know he's being a gentleman that's that's fine but it just shows how we're like giving

[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:31.720]  to cover but i want to get into russia get into ukraine get into isis uh with you first get into
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:39.400]  what's happening with the dollar with oil with greece uh joel scalzen well thank you very much
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:46.680]  alex it's really great to be with you you know we've had a lot of hype going on about the collapse
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:53.480]  of the euro about uh nuclear war being imminent with russia over ukraine and i continue to say
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:59.080]  you know there's a longer term globalist agenda here that uh is not going to allow for these
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:07.000]  things to be imminent and that's proving the dollar to collapse uh the failure of the bricks
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:12.840]  nation to be able to you know bring down the dollar uh or what's going on in greece rights
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:18.440]  right now where we saw uh as i predicted the european union gave in and gave them another
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:24.760]  four month extension again it wasn't six months that greece wanted uh the only concession that
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:32.920]  they gave was that greece gets to pick their own austerity to by the troika and so that's a
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:37.480]  you know a small tactical diplomatic battle they still have to come up with something today
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:45.320]  to tell how they're going to stop uh the continued tax evasion and uh reduction of civil service but
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:50.920]  as i said you know the longest agenda here is globalism and global and the e u is the
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:57.880]  it's the flower of globalism it's the show place they're not going to let that go down and uh
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:06.600]  where to exit the the eurozone it's not i'm not convinced in fact i'm fully convinced that the
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:13.560]  e u even though other countries may want to follow suit i think the euro showing sign
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:19.320]  or the e u is showing sign of doing whatever it takes to keep greek in to keep the exit from
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:26.520]  handling or from uh from going on and i think we'll continue to see that doesn't mean that
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:31.080]  things are solved greece has long-term problems it's not going to be solved by this additional
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:37.240]  bailout but it does kick the can down the road so that they can uh there'll be other major crises
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:42.760]  that come sure but in the future this global debt is all untenable and you got alan greenspad saying
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:46.920]  something begs coming of all these other elites saying get ready for something big obviously
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:51.560]  they engineer these things to consolidate power uh do you think it's going to be inflation do you
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:56.600]  think it's going to be deflation do you think the bubble's going to go on and give so for how long
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:03.800]  because most experts john williams you name it now say uh dr paul craig roberts has been
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:09.080]  saying three four years forever now he's saying it could be this year next year that we see a
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:14.200]  global meltdown i know that they have been saying this and they've been wrong for three and four
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:20.040]  years running and it's because they haven't really looked at what does it take to destroy
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:27.000]  answer these things several times in the world affairs brief um i've never got a suitable
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:33.240]  response from williams or peter schiff or jerald seleni on my major objections number one is that
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:39.400]  for hyperinflation which is the major way to take the dollar you've got to really have two things
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:44.440]  you've got to have a very modest money supply that can be doubled or tripled in a year uh to
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:49.160]  depreciate and make it the dollar become worthless but that isn't possible with the dollar there's
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:55.160]  over 200 trillion monetized dollars maybe even 300 trillion trillion and there's over a thousand
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:02.520]  trillion non-monetized contractual dollars out there the fed could print over 20 trillion a year
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:08.200]  and not exceed 10 of the money supply and that isn't hyperinflation and then for hyperinflation
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:13.320]  to occur the second thing has to occur you've got to have some kind of automatic indexing
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:19.240]  automatic way for common people to raise their income to keep pace with inflation otherwise
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:25.400]  you don't ever accumulate this full of hundred dollar bills that are worthless because you don't
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:31.000]  have any way to get those excess dollars that's right they have been expert at creating real
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:36.360]  depressions in the economy so that people never become wealthy enough to actually accumulate
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:44.360]  the excess dollars uh that said though i do see real inflation in some of the goods and services
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:50.600]  out there and i don't think of the economy wasn't contracting uh that that they'd be able to stop
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:57.720]  inflation i'm no economist i just simply see them with their different computer models managing
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:05.320]  things and i just wonder how long this can go on joel yeah i think actually can keep it going on a
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:12.280]  lot longer than we think for example the purpose of the zero debt policy is to keep the debt crisis
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:19.800]  from coming to uh ahead they can postpone that till after 2030 by keeping interest rates near zero
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:24.760]  because that means that the interest on the debt does not accumulate faster if they
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:30.680]  keep inflation and and john williams is right real inflation is between six and seven to eight percent
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:38.040]  now because they can keep it that way there won't be a hyper inflation um if they want to go
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:43.480]  and you start to have an inflation mentality people want to get rid of their dollars want to buy
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:48.360]  something it would heat up the economy but most people could not keep pace that creates
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:54.280]  stagflation like we have in the 70s when people can't afford to buy they stop buying if gas went to
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:17:02.200]  $10 people would stop buying again and so the fed shows every sign of in fact being very very
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:07.640]  cautious to not let inflation get over there they've they've got the advantage also in that there's a
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:13.240]  great deal of deflationary forces going on right now in the economy which is balancing out i think
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:18.440]  inflation would probably 12 to 14 percent if it weren't for the deflation that's what i was just
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:22.120]  getting at just from a layman's perspective so joel scows let me ask you this question
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:27.640]  geopolitically how are things going for the anglo-american power bloc versus the other blocks
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:34.040]  because we have numbers out four out of ten americans are one bill from disaster cbs news i mean in
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:41.000]  the real economy we've been in a recession slash unequally distributed depression for a long time
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.160]  but in certain corporate jobs or certain government jobs people are still doing quite well so it
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:53.880]  seems like they've created a new artificial class system that is actually right we have a selective
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:58.840]  recession right now there's a lot of people with a lot of money you look at the stock market over
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:06.920]  18 000 now this is the money in the big speculative economy these people get nearly free from the fed
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:11.960]  that they can invest in these speculative economies and make 15 to 20 percent why should they invest in
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:18.440]  a lot of money being spread around the economy the movie houses are full the restaurants are full
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:25.480]  and if there's 20 real unemployment and but even that isn't like the depression where you have 25
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:33.160]  percent in the depression nobody had any reserves there wasn't anything as in today's world you've
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:37.880]  got food stamps you've got unemployment compensation you've got relatives to live with people have three
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:43.640]  or four televisions they've got two or three cars there's a tremendous amount of reserves in this
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:50.120]  in the economy after 40 50 years of inflation that is in fact making it more resistant to
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:57.800]  the dire things that happen in that's right we've been such a wealthy nation that there's a lot of
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:02.360]  stores of wealth people are living with their parents longer but if you look at the demographic
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:09.080]  trends and if you look at the savings of younger people I do see this coming to a cataclysmic
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:14.440]  collapse somewhere down the road I mean it can't go on forever that is correct Alex it can't go on
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:21.960]  forever the key is can the powers to be can the Fed keep milking the bailouts along and can they
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:29.880]  keep managing the money supply along until war comes you see then they they escape the blame for
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:35.240]  this all right Joel your your your skype's breaking up really bad all of a sudden we're

[02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:20.280]  Alex Jones here back live Joel Skelzen the world affairs brief is our guest the editor of world
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:27.560]  affairs brief your phone calls are lining up brandon judy ben wane and others
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:35.960]  i want to talk about the moral decline why the establishment has engineered it
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:42.440]  and where this country is in the future and the huge preparations for civil oppression we see
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:48.040]  going on we'll do that in the next segment but getting into russia getting into the middle east
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:55.080]  the isis threat clearly created and given a safe harbor by the west the different power
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:25:02.600]  vacuums that are being battled over by iran by saudi arabia are we really at war with isis
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:07.240]  is it blowback hasn't gotten out of control or is there something bigger i want to get
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:15.720]  joel skelzen's take on that joel well thanks alex isis is as you said a western intelligence
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:23.080]  engineered crisis essentially al-qaeda was becoming old hat everyone was claiming to be al-qaeda and
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:28.440]  nothing was ever happening domestically across the border uh you know i've questioned that for
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:33.160]  years if we had real terrorism and they got a wide open border with mexico what's keeping
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:38.440]  al-qaeda from coming across the border daily and blowing up electrical pylons or blowing
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:43.800]  themselves up in malls and what's keeping isis from coming over to do that it's just unexplainable
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:48.840]  except for the fact that these intelligent or these terrorist organizations at the top
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:54.600]  that they start controlled by the governments and they are not giving orders to do so the reason
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:59.960]  is that it would get in the way of the social agenda of engineering a democratic majority
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.680]  through millions of latinos crossing the border if we had terrorism coming across the border
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:09.640]  americans would demand that shut that border down immediately and that's why they're not
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:15.160]  allowing terrorism to come across uh they control to the top they don't control necessarily
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:20.360]  now there's the normal terrorist doesn't know that uh the top leadership's controlled by the
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:24.920]  u.s intelligence and british intelligence working through israeli of misad agents
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:30.920]  arab agents trained by israel but that's really the reality what we're doing here and
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:36.360]  all of these isis videos are staged i mean this latest one was just a joke with the 20 so-called
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:43.480]  christians beheaded you see these isis characters in black almost towering a third the height over
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:49.560]  these uh supposed you know christian that's right we've looked at it it's blue screen even wired
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:54.120]  magazine six seven years ago had to come out and admit their video analysts looked at the
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:59.400]  inq tell videos they were releasing of adam gadon the son of the head of the adl who supposedly
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:07.960]  the leader of al qaeda now a jewish al qaeda member and the al qaeda video was put out in the pentagon
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:14.760]  video layer with their logo it was the same produced video at the same time yeah these are
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:19.960]  professionally produced videos by western video experts uh terrorists don't have these kinds of
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:26.600]  capability to do this uh really the reason for creating isis was as i think i've explained before
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:33.160]  on your show very carefully israel has been tasked by the globalist ever since 2004 to attack aran
[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:39.560]  and they said we can't do it until you take down syria uh two years ago they were set to take down
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:45.560]  syria with that no fly zone that's when uh kerry made the mistake in the london press conference by
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:50.680]  uh with a reporter asked him is there anything that syria can do to evade this he said well sure
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:55.640]  they could give up the capital weapons and wham syria and russia said we accept and all of a
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:02.440]  sudden in one mistake kerry derailed the entire rationale for going into syria so that's when
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:08.280]  they began to create isis in order to justify a back door approach to getting into syria we
[02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:14.520]  create a new terrorist organization basically divided the uh the rebels in syria the two groups
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:19.800]  say you're going to be the uh existing rebels and you're going to be the new group called isis
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:25.640]  and we'll set you off into iraq but you come from syria so we'll have an excuse to get back into
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:30.840]  syria to attack isis and now they're announcing all of that and we talked about this last year
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:35.640]  and predicted it it's now happening it also throws the military off the rank and file
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:40.280]  who are really getting upset two years ago about openly backing al-qaeda now they have a reason to
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:45.720]  go back in the region oh and while we're at it call in airstrikes for the good syrian rebels so
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:52.440]  exactly as we said they would do it they're now doing it that's right they've got the turkey involved
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:29:00.840]  in uh indirect uh shipping of arms and ammunition and funds and things to both sides isis isis and
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:07.480]  the so-called moderate rebels uh they're all controlled by western intelligence through
[02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:14.040]  israeli agents who are peppered the area with uh very highly trained era muslim radicals that
[02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:19.640]  they've trained to go in and direct these things and to be the recipients of various funds so this
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:27.160]  is a very directed uh false flag attack uh of isis but it is still meant to keep americans
[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:32.520]  diverted from the real crisis in the future which is russia and china as they continue to build for
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:40.360]  a strike against the west i do not believe that ukraine is going to trigger that directly i think
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:45.400]  this is a three or four year process stay there we gotta go to break a long segment coming up
[02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:51.000]  will segue into the detonator for world war three is the ukraine is it north korea what's

[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:45.800]  affairs brief dot com and your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes specific questions
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:59.240]  for joel scousen 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 joel i want to finish up with russia and china and
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:07.400]  geopolitical issues and just get your take on the eugenics anti-human anti-family anti-male
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:13.960]  political correctness people say oh silly political correctness but it's really designed
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:21.240]  to do something more curtail language and just shut people down and teach a form of nittying
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:27.800]  knowledge of obsessing on what people say and being offended to shut down real debate but
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:31.080]  before we go there finishing up with russia and what you think is happening in ukraine
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:38.760]  well we are seeing as i continue to predict that russia is being let to have a pass here
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:47.320]  they are in really open invasion now within ukraine with limited troops but highly trained
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:53.240]  troops ukraine is actually sabotaging their own version of the war the generals have leaked out
[02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:58.280]  they're not allowed to win this they're not allowed to put in sufficient troops to win
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:05.160]  anything it's a phony war but you know we continue to battle the major propaganda within our own
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:11.080]  movement alex of those and these are sincere people most of them i mean the eric's isis and the
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:17.560]  lendman's are pro-russian leftists who will continue to claim that russia has no sins the
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:23.640]  putin has no sins the castra has no sins this is just a globalist conspiracy against these innocent
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:29.560]  countries but it is not the globalists are not innocent they want to provoke war but they really
[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:37.400]  don't want to in fact engage russia they want russia to continue to look worse as they move
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:43.480]  through and russia is a predator nation russia is in ukraine to take back ukraine before world war
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:49.160]  three and you'll see that after ukraine is taking at least half of ukraine they probably won't get
[02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:53.000]  through completely to western ukraine but i think they'll get it surrounded with mobaba
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:57.880]  fully half of ukraine will fall to the new russia and then they'll start working on the
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:05.400]  Baltics all the while i'll tell you nato will do nothing in the u.s will do nothing sending arms
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:11.000]  ukraine will do nothing because there's no way that they can be used as sophisticated arms without
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:17.400]  training it'll be if anything a giveaway to the russians who will capture a lot of those weapons
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:24.120]  and i've continued to insist though that the anti globalists of which i count myself as one
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:31.560]  certain of our members on it are incorrect when they continue to height that this was a western
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:37.640]  a promulgated coup it's true that the western governments when they're facilitating some of
[02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:43.720]  the opposition but this was in fact a russian coup to the core a year ago almost this week
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:51.720]  we saw the the unexplainable happen where the opposition was allowed to win because the riot
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:59.640]  police run by the pro-russian janikovic regime was were ordered back to the barracks giving the
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:06.600]  opposition the free run of the governmental palace the governmental buildings and then on the saturday
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:14.440]  following that day the pro-russian party of regents ousted their own president it would be as if
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:20.360]  constitutional conservatives had been rioting and protesting in washington dc for three months
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:26.600]  and all of a sudden the marines abandoned the white house let us walk through the white house
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:31.880]  and the next day the democrats ousted barack obama how believable would that be but that's
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:37.240]  exactly what happened in ukraine it could not have been a western coup because the western
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:44.440]  opposition had no powers to order the bear coup back to the barracks and to order the republic
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:50.440]  or the uh their version of the democratic party to oust their own leader and that's why i say this
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:58.200]  is a false western pro-western government particularly sabotaging the war working in
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:04.280]  combination with russia to eventually let russia take back ukraine now joel scalzen i agree with
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:09.640]  you on probably 97 percent of what you have to say and on this subject i get your perspective what
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:16.840]  you're saying is true but let's pull back when this all started a year ago i went and showed the
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:21.560]  clips of the state department saying we've put five billion in the last 15 years george soros
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:28.840]  made statements on cnn on a different shows that he was involved in the destabilization
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:34.920]  they want to destabilize have the two sides fight with each other let russia carve off a piece of
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:41.160]  it and probably some secret deal then the e you can come in and say we've got to resurrect this
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:47.480]  and bail out the e you with federal reserve money claiming that it's not an e you bail out
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:52.840]  but that it's a marshal plan well we just saw tens of billions already sent in they're calling
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:39:00.280]  it a marshal plan so it's a larger destabilization of the whole region to then launch the new cold
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:07.960]  war for the new buildup for the next phase and this is more like hitler and stalin uh dividing
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:14.520]  poland before uh official world war two broke out and hitler double crossed stalin and operation
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:22.280]  barbarossa so that's what i see happening so i don't lionize the west or the plutonians i guess
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:27.000]  you could call them but clearly that area of ukraine is pretty much always been part of russia
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:34.200]  this is a replay of world war two with eastern russian ukraine battling western european ukraine
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:39.160]  and so that's why you see the same players there so i see it more as the globalist just
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:44.520]  wanting turmoil to consolidate control well you gotta remember the globalists are playing both
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:48.760]  sides always have they've been building up russia while they pretend to fight russia in a cold war
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:54.200]  building up china while they pretend to fight same thing happening here it was a propaganda lie
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:59.320]  when victoria newland said that they put five billion dollars into ukraine that was the entire
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:05.320]  budget for all of eastern europe you can't put five billion into a country like ukraine and not have
[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:10.440]  it show up in the banking system in other words she was propagandizing speaking to a pro-eurotanian
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:17.320]  rally uh but there's no way that they injected that directly into ukraine and george solos is
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:23.320]  being the globalist leader is basically feeding the fire within russia and others to give people
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:30.360]  want to believe this was a western coup but you see the us knows the media knows
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:36.760]  that the bercou went back to the barracks the media knows the party regions unelected their own
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:42.520]  leader nobody in the press has asked why and how did that happen and how did the western
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:49.960]  opposition do that until someone answers that question my proof stands this was a ruse just
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:56.040]  like the phony fall of the soviet union was a deception the phony coup in ukraine is a russian
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:03.080]  coup and the portoshenko and jeff stanko are working for the russians and sabotage that's why
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:11.960]  you know has all his friends are russian oligarchs that's why he betrayed the eastern russians after
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:18.040]  with his campaign promises they refused to let them speak russian in eastern ukraine he enraged
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:23.960]  them he sent in mercenaries to attack his own people to betray so that russia could then look
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:29.480]  like the savior coming in and taking over yeah in other words they've been sabotaging this looks
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:34.840]  like and i'm and i've got the proof as i say that these pro-western leaders are actually still
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:39.640]  working for us it just like team washenko was working for prudent well i mean it's on record
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:45.160]  that the entire leadership of al-qaeda and isis is working for nato working for the us working
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:50.760]  for turkey working for israel working for pakistan i mean it just keeps coming out so that would fit
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:57.640]  the the paradigm that's right we have to look deeper than the obvious on these things and going
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:03.240]  back to this i still think that the trigger for world war three is not going to be ukraine it's
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:10.520]  going to build up russia as the hegemonious uh enemy right across the border from europe and
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:17.080]  it's going to allow europe to but i think we're going to see just like uh happened in yalta just
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:20.920]  like what happened in munich we're going to see them continue to pamper and be permissive
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:26.440]  with the russian right up into the war but the actual trigger probably started north korea
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:31.400]  has to be a reason why the western governments continue to be permissive with north korea compared
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:37.720]  to iran um there's going to be a war in the middle east with iran as soon as syria is you know taken
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:44.840]  down uh with israel attacking iran but ultimately i think we have time i think this war is going to
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:52.520]  cover for the excuse of getting the entire west into a militarized global government
[02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:57.720]  and i think we're that's where all this is me i don't think it's imminent i think this is going
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:03.160]  to take time you're going to see ukraine mature for another year before they move into the Baltics
[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:08.760]  and the reason i say that is that russia and china still need more time to continue to build these
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:13.640]  weapons systems that they're in the process of building right now and we are going to continue
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:21.240]  to disarm just suicidal but as you said that's to entice the attack when the whole secret project
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:27.400]  just like nasa's 80 secret the military what we see of the military is not really the main
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:34.760]  military what we see is more of our un occupation force uh military that's 30 years old that's right
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:39.480]  our our government has secret weapons systems they're developing they're going to allow this
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:46.360]  a nuclear attack on american military forces uh so as to justify getting us into a new world order
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:52.680]  they need our american military force to be taken down in order to rampage or get us into a militarized
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:57.480]  global government but then they're going to pull on i think these secret weapons probably space
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:02.520]  space anti-missile weapons that are really affected with warheads on them unlike our current
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:09.080]  crop those abm's and they're going to hold back the russian and chinese nuclear attacks while they
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:14.040]  regroup and i think there's going to be uh but the russians and chinese are smart they know about
[02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:20.520]  all the secret weapons i'm not sure they do i think they suspect that's what's kept them at bay
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:26.200]  for many that's why they're still skittish about attacking uh but i don't i mean don't they didn't
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:31.080]  they see how we set up japan uh to attack i mean i mean they gotta know that's how the west and the
[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:36.680]  british intelligence operates yeah you know you would think so uh but you've got to remember
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:43.560]  that the russians and the chinese have as part of their strategic blood they must attack the west
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:48.120]  they do want to take down the west so they're not going to be deterred they're just looking for
[02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:54.440]  how much more can we build before we're confident enough to take them down and i think you know with
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:59.960]  pdd 60 which they also have got to know about pdd 60 tells our nuclear forces not to expect to
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:06.360]  launch on warning but to expect to absorb a nuclear first strike that was 1997 i think that was that
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:12.280]  telegraph message don't expect to get the codes to be able to launch against the first strike
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:16.440]  you're going to absorb a first strike and they took the launch codes away from the sub commanders
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:21.800]  yeah yeah and then they you know add that agreement with clinton with the soviets it was just a
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:25.320]  one-sided agreement we're going to keep 50 percent of our missile submarines in port
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:30.760]  at any one time to make sure that you can target it a little more easily to show our good intent
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:36.200]  that we have no offensive attention but as you know there's a lot of hidden secret nukes
[02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:38.680]  that the united states has i mean everybody cheats
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:46.360]  we i'm convinced that the globalists have a plan to win this after they absorb a nuclear
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:51.240]  first strike on our military but remember the cities are not to target the russians and chinese
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:57.080]  want to blackmail us into submission not destroy the markets that they depend on so i think the
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:02.520]  globalists know that this is a very complex scenario i understand that people's reluctance
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:07.240]  to want to maybe see well it's kind of a paradox why they need our military to be kind of the u n
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:11.640]  global force they want to build up nato as the new u n army that's admitted that's who they keep
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:17.960]  using for these u n operations but they know inherently one of the only cores of americana
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:22.680]  even though our military's been part of these evil wars is the military they know the military
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:26.600]  is the most awaited group of the globalist conspiracy that's why they want to coup they
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:33.080]  taught them in a nuclear attack yeah i think you're right well that fits in because they absolutely
[02:46:33.080 --> 02:46:36.440]  hate the military look what they do to them with these secret death lists and all the rest of it
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:39.400]  we didn't get to get into social issues i want to have you back soon to do that because i want
[02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:44.360]  to go to phone calls as promised brandon in texas you're on the year with joel scowles and go ahead
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:50.520]  yes sir first and foremost god bless both of you guys i'm a huge fan my question is
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:59.400]  whether it's a global war or some kind of economic collapse we hear a lot about collecting
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:05.960]  gold and silver coins so on and so forth for use for barter but how would that really be
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:12.760]  any use to another person that's you know up a creek just like me or anybody else in that event
[02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:19.240]  wouldn't it be more useful and in that case to stockpile things that people will need like
[02:47:19.240 --> 02:47:24.280]  something that's made out of unobtainium like a 22 ammo nowadays i'm sure you guys noticed and
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:31.000]  maybe even just for comfort like something along the lines of cigarettes i don't smoke them but
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:34.680]  maybe i should buy some or little bottles of whiskey what do you think about that
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:42.440]  well i think precisely uh that stockpiling things that remove your future need for money
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:49.160]  and provide barter items is really your best option but remember too that cash will be king
[02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:54.440]  i predict that there will not be hyperinflation before this war comes they're going to continue
[02:47:54.440 --> 02:48:00.760]  to try to keep things down below 10 percent thus you can hoard some cash but believe me there won't
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:06.840]  be any cash printing when war starts and so cash will be king until it starts to run out and then
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:13.080]  prices rise because of shortages that's when gold and silver become more valuable when prices rise
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:19.080]  because right now you can't you wouldn't be able to change for a two thousand dollar gold coin i
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:26.520]  like silver dollars as the premier barter coin just because they're big and fat and heavy
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:30.440]  and they're legal tender people don't have to determine whether or not this is a real coin or
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:35.160]  not i think if you're going to stockpile anything silver dollars is going to be the best one other
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:40.840]  than i mean rather than quarters and dimes that are silver because they look too much like what's
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:45.640]  out there existing so silver dollars cash will be king first of all then silver dollars
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:51.240]  but ultimately in the long term of this war and there's going to be starvation there's going to be
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:55.640]  famine for a couple of years you've got to be able to get out of those urban areas and you're
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:01.800]  going to have to have stockpiles to use and to trade especially things that are usable like
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:08.120]  light bulbs like blues screws ammunition shortwave radios and let's just say it joe you know
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:12.840]  people do anything for liquor once this all goes now people could argue it'd be a moral but the
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:19.640]  classic barter item would also be like things like whiskey well you know the so-called who is
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:25.880]  at the bosny and guy who is promoting his wares about survival is talking about you know cigarette
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:31.320]  lighters were key well they aren't here in the united states in europe people still smoke like chimneys
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:37.720]  but not here so it's not good as smoking is not going to be a barter item like it is in in europe
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:46.120]  liquor maybe but i still think a lot of americans will need food and things to repair things quicker
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:51.400]  than i was about to say somebody that's got their own solar power and wind power and like a tinker
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:56.040]  repair machine shops those will end up being little mini cities during a full collapse right
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:01.400]  that's right you know and the bosnian guy claims well nobody used any cars but that was bosnia
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:07.480]  those were high density urban areas out here in the west and things q will be king as well
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:12.200]  and you will be able to sell fuel like gold someday so there's a lot of things that you
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:19.000]  could stockpile that are i think more useful ultimately than gold silver oh absolutely fuel
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:26.680]  out in uh areas that aren't dense will be king brandon does that answer your question uh pretty much um i
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:32.200]  have maybe a little bit of a continuation of that question uh mr scalson mentioned that uh
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:39.160]  people should be getting out of urban areas but wouldn't those be the most likely areas that the
[02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:45.720]  powers that be at the time would want to control and as we've seen in places like somalia and others
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:51.880]  that those are the places where they deliver the food supplies where the the rural areas were pretty
[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:59.240]  much left to their own devices well that's right and that's why you want to be in the rural areas
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:04.120]  so that they leave you alone basically and have your stockpiles remember you can't grow in urban
[02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:08.440]  area you are totally dependent on we've got to go to break stay there we'll be right back

[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:40.280]  redoubts we talked about this 15 years ago but it was even a london guardian last week or two weeks
[02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:45.400]  ago that elites are buying places all over the world in rural areas and putting in long
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:51.480]  airstrips so they can run from europe in the us most of the rich billionaires in israel have
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:56.120]  left israel the last five years and we talked about this before it was known because we have a
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:55:00.920]  lot of sources i know joel does and i do as well but he built houses for you know really rich folks
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:06.040]  and common folks as well that are secure uh so they've been running to the hills they're not running
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:11.160]  into the cities those are the places you won't want to be during a collapse you want to elaborate
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:16.280]  on that joel before you go to judy yeah even the cities will not be able to be controlled by the
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:21.080]  powers that the i mean there's just i mean i don't even think police aren't going to show up for duty
[02:55:21.080 --> 02:55:27.240]  soldiers are going to show up for duty uh because their families will be subject to mobs uh it's
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:33.480]  just going to be chaos and so people will leave the cities it's a matter of preparing places before
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:39.480]  that happens so that you're not caught in the maelstrom and then know your neighbors so the group
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:43.480]  you know two years into a collapse comes over there we'll be just like road warrior wanting to
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:47.480]  take over you're ready to deal with them the good part about areas that have the second amendment
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:51.320]  though i predict those are going to be areas that are a lot safer what about areas where they've
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:56.920]  disarmed people like california and in in dc you know that have cultures of just supine
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:56:03.080]  worshiping of tyranny my god those are going to be carnal charnel houses of hellish exploits
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:07.640]  for the criminal element absolutely that's why it's strategic relocation you know we
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:12.520]  rate different areas differently especially by these criteria like second amendment like
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:18.520]  if the freedom to homeschool freedom for uh natural medical care uh as well as climate and other
[02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:23.960]  things a lot of good information as strategic relocation that people ought to get the book
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:28.840]  and the film at infowarstore.com i mean people don't i think they're insane uh they're so both of
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:33.160]  them are so well done and we're honored to work with you on that that's what the whole illegal
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:38.840]  alien open invasions about i mean obama is acting as a dictator but notice the republicans aren't
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:45.400]  challenging him joel no that's right and there was a judge that had the guts to shut it down and now
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:52.600]  the obama administration is shopping for a judge to release that that order so that the illegal
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:57.800]  agenda can keep going forward but i think that's why the southern states have got a problem you
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:02.760]  know texas even where you are you know it's going to be a a mexican state one of these days that
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:08.760]  again i think well that's the globalist plan to get folks to vote uh with the democratic agenda
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:14.600]  that's the plan that's right they want to water down conservative voting uh patterns and they're
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:19.000]  not going to stop this illegal flow no matter what we do it's one of those things they don't take
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:28.200]  no for an answer judy in florida judy you're on the air welcome yes hi alex hi i'm listening i'm
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:33.000]  just really getting more and more concerned and frightened really about what is coming over our
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:39.160]  border whether it's uh the illegal aliens or uh the chinese they're coming here and having children
[02:57:39.160 --> 02:57:44.760]  but all that aside um because america's been totally sold out i mean we we offer to pay for
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:49.560]  anybody's kids in the world and this is the plan to turn us into a tower of babel go ahead
[02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:54.920]  yeah and i know people that are perfectly fine with that that i thought were real intellectuals
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:59.880]  and people that i thought loved this country but they're just brainwashed crazy people but um
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:05.320]  what i don't understand is is how this is not really like a currency war that's taking place
[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:09.960]  and i guess this is my question is how is this not really a currency war because this is the
[02:58:09.960 --> 02:58:16.040]  anglo-american establishment just looking for the boogie man that they can blame when the financial
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:21.160]  collapse does occur i mean they want world war three don't they in full swing and also what do
[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:25.560]  you say to the people like me and my family that are not going to be able to get to some type of
[02:58:25.560 --> 02:58:31.000]  armored redoubt and we're going to be stuck in mainland america you know with all the suffering
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:38.600]  that's a good point um joel well as i say you know the currency wars are continued to uh to go back
[02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:43.000]  and forth but i'm going to tell you the dollar will remain king there's no other currency in the world
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:47.240]  that can replace the dollar the euro would have to be inflated stay there we're gonna come back and
[02:58:47.240 --> 02:58:53.000]  finish up with that and overdrive and go to truth ben gregory erin and others stay with us joel scousers
[02:58:53.000 --> 02:59:01.960]  our guests communications radio network what disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain

[03:00:36.600 --> 03:00:43.000]  is really informative uh i wanted to say as well i got another bottle of supermail vitality
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:49.240]  in the mail this past week after not having it for a few weeks and uh you know it's not like
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:54.280]  there's a problem before but now there's not a problem and then there's not a problem and then
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:01:00.200]  there's not a problem well again it's not a drug it's not herbs that hype you up or anything it's
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:04.440]  just herbs that get your glands naturally going all of our glands have been suppressed by the
[03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:09.160]  additives and all the garbage the testosterone of a 50 year old man is half of what it should be
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:14.200]  on average uh growth hormones are a lot lower than it should be and it's just a fact that god's given
[03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:20.040]  us natural things of the earth that aren't drugs that have great results so so thank you supermail
[03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:24.760]  and superfuel vitality are amazing thanks for the plug yeah well anyway uh lego was
[03:01:25.640 --> 03:01:31.480]  was going to say i actually live in a densely populated urban area i'm in st louis city
[03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:37.960]  in one of the safer areas of st louis city um my question for your guest is what are the
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:46.200]  most important things to get before you need to bug out so if the worst case scenario happens
[03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:53.320]  and you know obviously you make your preparations as you can but say you only have enough you know
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:58.600]  um a truck bed to fill up what are the things that he would recommend i think the most important
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:03.000]  thing to see interrupt here is to pick the right place you're going to go uh and then to answer
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.160]  the other lady's question first what do you do if you don't have money to get out of a major city
[03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:14.360]  joan well i agree with you alex it's not a matter of what you can carry with you out because you
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:19.400]  may have to walk out that's why you've got to pick this place and have things stockpiled in
[03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:25.320]  advance and even if it's at a friend's house that's 30 miles out of the city you want to stockpile fuel
[03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:30.040]  you want to stockpile other things so that if you can get out uh you know and some people you
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:36.520]  can get cars old cars dime a dozen stockpiled at a friend's place so that even if you have to walk away
[03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:41.960]  then you can drive once you're out of the of the areas but the key is get your stockpiles
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:46.840]  distributed out so that they're not stuck in the city when you try to leave
[03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:52.200]  all right call her i'm going to jump thank you so much for the kind words we got 20 off
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:56.680]  on the supermail and female vitality products if you'll just try them we could find our whole
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:03:01.320]  operation if you try them almost everybody that buys keeps buying so in the equation we get enough
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:05.800]  people to buy it we're going to be able to really expand this operation because it's that good uh
[03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:11.640]  infowarslife.com uh let's now go to Gregory in Illinois you're on the air with Joel Scowleson
[03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:21.560]  go ahead yeah hi Alex hi Joel all right my my question i don't know Joel if you were the uh
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:28.680]  guest of Alex that predicted that the Ebola outbreak was uh simulant and Ebola simulant
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:33.720]  now he's the one that said that he thought it was a simulant and not really Ebola
[03:03:33.720 --> 03:03:39.400]  and if they were just using it as a pretext to learn how to take over an emergency which
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:43.880]  Obama later basically admitted so they they were dragging people away but it was all just
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:50.440]  to see what we do basically Joel yeah i mean it wasn't intended to become the major plague uh
[03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:56.360]  they were trying to uh invent other strains that are more suitable for biological warfare
[03:03:56.360 --> 03:04:00.600]  but they were prepping the areas and we say the measles thing right now is prepping people
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:06.520]  for mandatory vaccines so it's just all pr brainwashing events because the doctors were seeing
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:10.680]  people disappeared we had them on the show but who knows what was going on i mean we just know
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:20.360]  there was a cover-up in al's Gregory yeah i was wondering if it really was a simulant uh because
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:27.480]  i kind of like the story just kind of disappeared and i thought maybe the uh the virus or whatever
[03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:35.480]  it was mutated faster than they thought it would but they aren't killing us whether or not
[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:40.840]  able to harvest mutated forms i'm sure they were trying they were taking blood samples
[03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:46.360]  over everything but it is dying now the virus is dying out most of those areas covered or
[03:04:46.360 --> 03:04:50.840]  our eyes god for that the scary thing is is that ap have reported new jersey they have
[03:04:50.840 --> 03:04:56.200]  a secret Ebola center that locals weren't told about so we know they use it as a pretext to test
[03:04:56.200 --> 03:05:01.000]  medical tyranny disappearing people just like with measles in the four shots worldaffairsbrief.com
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:05.880]  that's Joel Scowze's site get his book and film at infowarstore.com and support the broadcast
