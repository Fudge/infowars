[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  It is Sunday, June 24th, 2023, and I have just had an incredible day here at the River
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]  Church Complex in Tampa, Florida, with Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown, simply amazing, so gracious,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  so real.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.800]  I've loved this guy since I discovered him 15 years ago, and I've been interviewing him
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.480]  for 10 years.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.720]  But it's just amazing to be here with this gracious family, and this entire church family
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.720]  are just amazing people.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.880]  And I tell you, I've never felt the Spirit of God and the Holy Ghost as strong as I felt
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.880]  today.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.640]  I was reading the Great Commission and basically enrolling everybody into the fight against
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.520]  the devil, and it was just amazing.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.920]  I've just never have felt the Holy Ghost so strong.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.880]  You see Holy Ghost churches, which is really just what the Bible says, it's all right there
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.880]  in the Bible.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.440]  You see the preachers and people being overcome by the power of the Holy Ghost, and you say,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.840]  well, some people, it's psychological or whatever.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.840]  Today, when he was doing the Great Commission, I almost fell down.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800]  It was that strong.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.800]  It was so intense that I got dizzy.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.880]  It was so strong in my heart that I almost fell over.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.040]  I was there saying, I want the commission.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.200]  I want to save people.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200]  I want to fight Satan.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.120]  And I've been saved for a long time, but it was so strong, and it was so powerful.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.760]  God's strength was so powerful, I almost passed out, and then had to stop thinking about the
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.360]  Holy Spirit for a minute or I would have fallen down.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.760]  This actually happened, and I've never had that happen to me in my life.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.520]  And I've been to Pentecostal churches when I was quite a bit when I was a child and did
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.800]  Bible school some there and things like that, because we attended a lot of churches, but
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.920]  a lot of Pentecostal ones, a lot of what you call evangelical, and I was growing up in
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.800]  Dallas, Texas, and also grew up around a lot of folks that were in the church.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.840]  And I would just have to laugh at it or roll my eyes, but I was just, well, that's never
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.840]  happened to me.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.840]  And I almost fell down today.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.360]  I had to like pull out and say, whoa, back off this or I was going to fall over.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.560]  So because I had that instinct that I'm going to fall down, and I was like, I'm about to
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560]  fall down.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560]  I said, whoa, okay.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.000]  And the Holy Spirit instantly just backed off, and it was very intense, absolutely intense.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  Wow.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]  So that happened.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.480]  I'm still blown away right now, just absolutely about to fall over right now, I can't even
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480]  think about it.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.680]  God, it's so real, ladies and gentlemen, and the spirit of all those people there together,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.080]  it was powerful.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.600]  So that said, this Purgogian, and I always say his name wrong, I've been, I know who the
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600]  guy is for 20 years.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.960]  I study Russia, I know that, but I can't pronounce the names, okay?
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.440]  We've got a Russian linguist and folks coming on who work for the military, who's really
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.000]  smart and studied the Russians and all that for over 20 years in the military.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.680]  He'll be joining us on the Tuesday show here in studio, and I've decided to stay here until
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680]  Wednesday.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.800]  We're having such an amazing time, and we've got a bunch of other special guests as well.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.000]  But he was listening to me on Patrick Bet-David's show yesterday and said that he thought my
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.360]  analysis was dead on on the situation in Russia.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.680]  Purgogian, Purgogian, however you say it, Trump's, not Trump's, Putin's chef, I've got
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.800]  some Trump news on that front, by the way, is just a complete maniac out of his mind.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.480]  I don't think British intelligence or US intelligence was behind him.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.080]  I think this was purely him on a complete maniac power trip, and that he really got in a delusion
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.240]  of grandeur and thought that he was going to attack the Russian military and drive
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.640]  into Moscow and the people were going to join him and that this was going to be this amazing
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.640]  thing.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.400]  Strangely enough, just today, the Pentagon came out and said that's what they think happened.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.680]  I don't just agree with the Pentagon because they're the Pentagon.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.920]  I disagree with what they say a lot, and they lie a lot.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920]  We know that.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.240]  But in this case, they're saying, well, Purgogian said back in June of last year, when the war
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.280]  was only a few months old, and he said it again this year, that there might be an uprising
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.560]  and that Russians are going to overthrow Putin if he isn't hardcore enough and basically
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560]  put him in charge.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.120]  Well, I remember when he said it, watching the Russian news.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.320]  I don't just believe our media.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320]  I go and check it.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.960]  So the Pentagon doesn't always lie.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:32.480]  It's like when they said Putin is going to invade the next month back in January of 2022,
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.120]  and that he's going to stage a false flag to do it.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.840]  I said, well, in this case, I think it's true.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.840]  They'll invade by February.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.160]  And then, indeed, they did blow some stuff up and say that it had been the West and use
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.280]  that as a pretext to move in.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.440]  So they got that right.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.320]  And I think this is Purgogian on his own.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.160]  And it could have gotten completely out of control.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.480]  Thank God reality sunk into him and he quit really quick.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.600]  But we'll talk about what could have happened and what's going to happen if they're able
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600]  to take out Putin.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.040]  This is a big deal.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.000]  Here's a special guest coming up.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.720]  Two amazing new tropics.

[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.880]  And they're both 50 percent off.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.200]  We haven't offered these for 50 percent off since last Christmas.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.680]  These are amazing products.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.520]  And for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.640]  BrainForce Ultra hits in 15 minutes, only lasts three hours with no hangover.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.240]  It is a game changer.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.960]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.040]  Again, our BrainForce Plus is a good, basic, clean new tropic, gives you four to six hours
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.720]  of amazing energy, again, with no hangover, no jitters.

[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.520]  And know, you're funding the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.880]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.680]  And the answer for energy is BrainForce.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.200]  Well, regular listeners and viewers know, I want to welcome you all to this Sunday night
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.280]  broadcast that when there's big news, I got a ton on my plate.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.920]  I tend to start talking faster and faster, almost like I'm one of those folks they have
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.840]  at those events where they're auctioning things off, the auctioneers.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.680]  I don't want to talk like Porky Pig.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.720]  I want to really just paint with big, broad brushes here down to the basics and then flesh
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.800]  out the details.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.480]  But there's so much proof of all this, and so many angles to it, and so many insane dangers
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.200]  that come along with it, that it's really hard here today to describe how dangerous the
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:10.680]  fiasco that we just saw in Ukraine and in Western Russia, in and around Moscow yesterday
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.760]  that, thank God, ended in less than 24 hours.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:22.040]  But the danger of the West trying to jump on board with Purgosian, the head of Wagner,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.560]  that was trying to create a chain reaction and trigger an uprising by claiming he was
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:34.480]  going to drive 300 miles up a highway to Moscow and overthrow Putin for treason, is just so
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.680]  dangerous.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.960]  Because the hardliners like Purgosian that want control are way, quote, worse than what
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.960]  Vladimir Putin is.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.160]  If you think Vladimir Putin's bad, then you're really not going to like what Purgosian was
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.680]  going to be doing.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.880]  And so this is a really dangerous fiasco.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.680]  There's hundreds of different angles to this, obviously, and we're going to have big analysts
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.280]  on to talk about it.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.120]  Scott Bennett was an Army officer, psychological warfare expert, working with the CIA and others,
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.480]  running major operations all over the world.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.480]  Scott Bennett was.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.080]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.960]  And then Scott Ritter is going to be joining us, former head UN weapons inspector.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.640]  So Scott Bennett and then Scott Ritter.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.920]  We're also going to have other special guests like the pastor here at Studio Writing Shotgun
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.760]  with us as well, and some other great folks.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.000]  So stay with us for all of that.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.480]  But I'm going to try to calm down here.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.240]  And by calm, I'm not even excited by the information.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.640]  I'm just excited by how much info there is.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.280]  And I really should just write notes when something is this wild, because I'm just constantly
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]  thinking about it.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.640]  This just began to break Friday evening into yesterday afternoon.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:49.200]  So I don't just believe the official story about Purgosian, which is becoming he acted
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:56.160]  on his own and was a megalomaniac and was delusional and came back to his senses before
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.520]  things really got out of control.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.720]  That's what Putin said yesterday.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.440]  And I was like, well, let me wait and see.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.960]  Now the Pentagon, I've got articles came out and said, no, we're not involved in this.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.840]  This is Purgosian.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.240]  And I agree with that, because Purgosian, I've been watching him since this war started
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.840]  a year and a half ago, roughly, a little less than a year and a half ago.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.200]  He's been on a power trip the entire time saying all of this, I'm going to overthrow
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.680]  the government with my mercenaries, you're a bunch of wimps, we're the heroes, the military
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.800]  can't do anything.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:35.480]  And when Putin appeased him, because he is one of his, quote, former best friends, it
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480]  built a megalomaniac.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.960]  And if you study history with Julius Caesar or thousands of other documented events in
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.720]  every culture, every place, a lot of times you'll have a general or somebody that does
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.320]  really well in a war when other people aren't doing well.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.160]  And they will end up coming in and taking over and becoming a dictator.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.480]  I mean, look at Julius Caesar.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.320]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.320]  Everybody else is failing.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.320]  He's winning.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.760]  He's been exiled to Germania and conquered it when nobody else could for 500 years.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.360]  He comes and crosses the Rubicon.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360]  The rest is history.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:10.000]  And he kind of marked that as the peak, the beginning of a 400-year decline of the Roman
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.760]  Empire.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.400]  And so history repeats.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.840]  And this just fits the classic patterns of how humanity operates.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.920]  Now, as soon as Purgosian started this, MI6, the CIA and others came in and said, OK, maybe
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.920]  he's a good guy.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.920]  And they reached out to him.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.520]  They admitted that.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.960]  But they're now pointing out that they were not involved in it from the beginning because
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.680]  it failed and they want to deny that they were involved.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.760]  But I tend to believe that they weren't involved because this is an internal Russian power
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.280]  game.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.480]  And that's a classic thing that happens in any culture, but particularly the Russians
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.520]  follow that human pattern probably worse than anybody else.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:52.920]  By worse, I mean, once wars start going bad, the Russians always have a civil war internally
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.440]  at the highest levels over who's going to be in charge.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.640]  And so the knives are out for Vladimir Putin.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.160]  Now, a lot of people are going to say, well, this is a great thing if the knives are out
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160]  for Vladimir Putin.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.720]  Well, again, you get rid of Vladimir Putin, you're going to get something.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.720]  Probably worse.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.840]  And again, maybe in the process of taking out Putin, who knows what happens with these
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.840]  nuclear weapons?
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.680]  Again, this is an incredible wild card.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.960]  It'd be like if the United States was in a war.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.280]  But the major neighbor was being funded by China and Russia with heavy weapons.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.920]  And then they tried to foment or jump on the back of.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.920]  And support a coup internally.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.560]  Does that sound safe to just see what happens with a coup inside America and see what would
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.280]  come out of that?
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.560]  And to have a bunch of generals and people battling each other for control?
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.400]  Does that sound like a stable good thing when you don't even know what ideology is going
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.680]  to be in control?
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.560]  Most revolutions end badly.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.040]  Most revolutions bring in something worse than what they got rid of if they're violent.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.200]  The American Revolution is one of the few, they call it basically in some of the PhD
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.600]  level analysis worldwide, the perfect revolution.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.000]  I mean, it's one of the few that produced something amazing that was the model of the
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.720]  world and was adopted by the whole world, or the world began to adopt it across the
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.760]  world for the next hundred plus years, 200 years.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.000]  So that's where we are right now.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.760]  And this is extremely dangerous.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.080]  Exactly what I said a year and a half ago when this all started.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.120]  I said this is not going to go well for Russia.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.480]  And it's going to become this big pissing match between NATO and Russia.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.560]  And it's going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.480]  It's going to cost hundreds of thousands of lives.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.840]  And if you look at the threat ladder of threat escalation and the RAND Corporation's analysis
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.600]  of how these wars will unfold, particularly in Eastern Europe, in war games of exactly
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.720]  this scenario, it ends in tactical nukes being used and then theater nukes being used and
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.680]  then all out nuclear war and billions dead.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.600]  And then out of that, the main collapse of civilization and more than half the world
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.400]  population dying on the low end from starvation and breakdown of civilization and reactors
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.320]  melting down and just all the ensuing chaos that comes out of that.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.920]  Because even if you don't believe Atlantis existed and they had this big power source
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.360]  that blew up the Atlantic and blew their island up, and they had flying machines, Plato said,
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360]  and he was a historian.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360]  I don't know if it was real.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.960]  The point is, is that, and what they described as automatons, big robots, whether that was
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.680]  real or not, we now are Atlantis.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.280]  We have the power to blow ourselves up.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.160]  We have big automaton robots.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160]  We have all this stuff.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.880]  So what Plato claimed thousands of years ago, 2,300 years ago, was existed previously does
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.440]  exist now.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.280]  And so we have the power to blow ourselves up, and we're the same fallen sinners, probably
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.280]  worse than our ancestors.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.960]  In fact, the genetics shows what the Bible says.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:44.520]  Our genetics is unraveling, falling apart, getting worse, was better before, degenerating
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.520]  quickly.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.520]  Look at men today versus men 100 years ago, how masculine we were.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.240]  Look at men from, say, my generation, and I'm not as masculine as my father's generation
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.320]  or his father.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.700]  And then look at the boys today.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.700]  We're literally rotting.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.480]  Humanity is falling apart.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.640]  We are degenerating.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:06.240]  But my point is, is that we're now about to fall on a thermonuclear sword or a biological
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.840]  weapons sword.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.200]  And now they admit, oh, we're going to reward Fauci and Peter Hotez.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.640]  We're going to give more bioweapons funding to the Wuhan lab, more bioweapons funding
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.640]  to Ukraine.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.640]  Remember last year?
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640]  We were liars.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.640]  There's no bioweapon labs.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.200]  We were enlisting them and opening them 12 years ago, Washington Post articles.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.480]  But, oh, they said, oh, no, there's no bioweapon labs in Ukraine last year.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.480]  Alex Jones and everybody else is a liar.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.480]  Even though I could go back to those articles, it's the same thing here.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:39.760]  I have the articles where, however the hell you pronounce this lunatic's name, excuse
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.320]  me, Lord, however you pronounce his name, saying, I'm going to overthrow the Russian
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.320]  government.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.080]  I'm going to get all these Russians that are mad that you're not winning the war to overthrow
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.600]  Putin.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.680]  And Putin patted him on the head and said, stop it.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.360]  You don't mean that, Purgogin.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360]  And then now look what he did.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.000]  So I will say this.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.080]  This weakens Putin.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.400]  It'll make other lunatics around him think that they can do a coup because he is popular.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.320]  He has been reelected for 20 plus years.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.080]  I know people like Rodney Howard Brown, who's from Africa, where they fought the Russians
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.080]  in the 70s, 80s.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.040]  And when he was growing up, it's like the only good Russian is a dead Russian.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.240]  But since then, he's been over there and started churches over there.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.200]  And these guys got churches all over the world that he started.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.480]  This guy's amazing, incredible evangelist.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.120]  And he was calling me today while I was with him.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.280]  They were saying, no, this makes Putin more supported by us.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.680]  But it encourages other people to think they can try to take a shot at him.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.600]  Because look, Purgogin didn't get arrested.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.440]  He got to run off to Belarus, which means white Russian.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.080]  I guess since they're more Western, they've got lighter hair and lighter skin.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080]  Literally, that's what it means.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.320]  Oh, that's where the white Russians ran over there.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:49.440]  So the point is, he's run to white Russia, and he's there, and he just got away with
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440]  this.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.680]  And again, I'm not trying to get involved in Russian politics.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.680]  I'm not trying to do this.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.720]  But some people are spinning it, oh, no, this makes Putin stronger.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.440]  He put down this rebellion.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.440]  I don't think so.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.560]  And again, that's a place of concern.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.720]  I'm not a Putin file.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.360]  I'm not a Putin booster.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.960]  But I will tell you, and the CIA agrees with this, and so does the State Department.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.400]  They take out Putin.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.320]  It's an 80-plus percent chance you get somebody more hardline.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.640]  Well, then why does the CIA and the State Department want that?
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.200]  Because they want a Russia that's hardline, that falls apart, that can be isolated like
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.120]  North Korea, so they can then have a new enemy, relaunch the Cold War, and then have Russia
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.800]  fall apart, right as Russia's becoming more Christian and industrializing and wanted to
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.800]  work with the West.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.920]  I mean, Putin cut defense spending the last 10 years.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.120]  Putin wanted to work with the West.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.880]  So the globalists want a confrontation with Russia, while the communist Chinese are the
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.400]  real threat, and the globalists internally in our nations are the real threat.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400]  That is my view.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.880]  Throughout the week, we'll take calls, we'll have special guests on, we'll debate it, we'll
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.440]  discuss all of it together.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.080]  But that's basically where I see this standing.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:03.400]  And again, this does not make Putin look stronger that Purgosian is run off after doing this
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.760]  to Belarus and has done this.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.040]  He tried to send 30,000 troops and hundreds of armored vehicles and tanks and thousands
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.560]  of vehicles to Moscow.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.400]  Now, think how crazy he is.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.880]  Never been in the military, is a former convict, has a good idea, I mean, our military's done
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.480]  that before in World War II and stuff, empty out the prisons, send them in, you know, dirty
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.480]  dozens of fictional story about that, but that stuff has gone on, send them in, and
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.600]  they were better soldiers than the average, quote, snowflakes, just like our men are
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.160]  snowflakes now compared to past generations, on average, not everybody.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.000]  And so, yeah, he did some big frontline battles, half his forces got killed.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.560]  He'd sit out there while artillery was exploding around him, has a lot of courage, but he went
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.680]  crazy in the last year and a half in that position and believed he was God and believed
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:55.480]  he was invincible and then believed he could send 30,000 troops up a 300-mile highway right
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:00.440]  into Moscow, one major road to Moscow, it'd be the highway of death.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.520]  They would just send in 500 jets and blow them all up in an hour.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.240]  And then 100 helicopters could have taken it out, they can put like 15, 20 missiles
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.240]  on those helicopters.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.480]  So what was Purgosian thinking?
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.920]  Well, he thought, I'm coming to invade, I'm going to overthrow Putin, and he thought that
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.560]  the Russian snowflake regular military would just cut and run, and Putin did go to St.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.600]  Petersburg as a security measure, you could say he did, I'm not attacking Putin, it's
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.000]  just a fact, whereas if Putin wanted to look strong, he would have moved to the front with
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.160]  forces and been there, like Purgosian, with his binoculars, watching that column be burned.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.960]  He shouldn't have done a deal with Purgosian and sent him off to White Russia.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.560]  He should have said, I want, which he has, 1,000 attack helicopters that are right around
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.120]  Moscow, their main forces are reserves, their high-tech weapons haven't even been used, they've
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.360]  used their old junk in the police action on purpose, that would have sent 1,000 helicopters
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.600]  down there and lined up and destroyed that entire column and then killed Purgosian, Putin
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600]  would have been strong.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.160]  But I get it, Putin's like, I don't want a civil war, I don't want to slaughter Russians,
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.760]  he's going to let them now join the Russian military and try to mop this up, and maybe
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.680]  Putin's smarter than I am, okay?
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.840]  All I'm saying is, a destabilized Russia, and the fall of Putin at this point is rolling
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.360]  the dice, when even mainline analysts say the dice are loaded, and an 80% chance they're
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.800]  going to roll towards somebody, quote, worse than Putin, if you even believe the West analysis.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.240]  So I'm not rolling the dice with my children, I'm not rolling the dice with you, but I'm
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.240]  not in charge, okay?
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:36.040]  And neither is Putin, and neither is Blinken, and neither is Obama, who's the real president
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.760]  right now, and he's globalist.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.520]  And that's the thing, Putin's not God, you're seeing that, these are just men, they may
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:48.440]  be in big ivory towers and big marble buildings and big fancy edifices, but look out at the
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.760]  hundreds of billions of galaxies they've already photographed, that's God's building, that's
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:58.200]  just God's pinky finger, that's just one atom in God's hand, you think God's big?
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.760]  Look at God's front porch, it's all of the universe, and the universe is an endlessness.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.680]  So I'm sick of people thinking men are gods, I'm sick of people thinking that our government,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.360]  the Russian government, and the Chinese government have got it all figured out, and who the intel
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.240]  knows what's going on, and they all know what's happening, no, they don't know what's happening,
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.280]  they're just men.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.200]  But now we're running around like monkeys in a fireworks factory with flamethrowers,
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.480]  with all this incredible technology we've got, because we are made in the image of God,
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.560]  we are amazing creators, we can do incredible things, but as we become more evil, as our
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:35.200]  genetics fall apart, as we become more demonic and more fallen, we are discovering though
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.840]  more and more of the power we have, because we're made in the image of God, and can build
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.600]  all this technology.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:46.120]  You can see where this is headed, a fallen, degenerate, satanic population, given godlike
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:51.720]  weapons and powers, blowing ourselves up, no flesh will be spared if God didn't intervene,
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.080]  and that's what's going to happen, God's going to let us rot all the way down to the
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.680]  water line, and as we're sinking, God's going to save us, but not before one fourth of
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:05.440]  the planet, we believe the revelations, is dead, so yes, it's all being queued up, it's
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.000]  all being prepared, I don't believe we're in the revelation yet, we're not in the tribulation
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.720]  yet, but you can see all of it being fulfilled, world government, world currencies, you must
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.400]  serve the beast, you must do what the banks say, or they won't let your algorithm work,
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.600]  or your ESG, you have to worship the beast, do what it says, let it watch everything you
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:31.440]  do, follow its every order, and then it will give you a good rating.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.720]  That's what all this is, ladies and gentlemen, every bit of it being fulfilled in your face
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:40.040]  right now, and it's going to get more and more obvious, with devil worship everywhere,
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.840]  I mean I was on a big podcast here, Patrick McDavid, great guy, smart guy, made hundreds
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.120]  of millions of dollars in business, really smart guy, and I'm like, yeah, you know how
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:55.120]  Target in the last few months had the LGBTQ thing, it's about pedophilia, sex with kids,
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.120]  said we're going to get your kids, and said we love Satan, and this is a satanic operation,
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.560]  we're going to cut Christians' heads off with guillotines, he goes that's it, you're
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:09.520]  making this up, he pulls it all up, mainstream news, his mouth is hanging open, this stuff
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:15.840]  is so over the top, and it's so dangerous, and America is in no position to dictate a
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:21.160]  Slavic civil war, America is in no position to go start something that most analysts agree
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:26.600]  will probably have continued, lead to nuclear war, but the globalists are a bunch of degenerate
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.080]  Satanists, and they just love it, their God loves it, and it's positioning us into total
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]  destruction.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.040]  There's a good article in the New York Post, Putin is on his way out, but things could go
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.760]  from Vlad to worse, and it admits it'll probably get worse if Putin's removed.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.440]  Media claims U.S. intelligence knew about Gorgon's planned mutiny in mid-June, I don't
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.120]  need to believe that article, he was all over, I watched the videos last year of him saying
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.840]  there's going to be a civil war, and we're going to overthrow Putin, and if he doesn't
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.960]  do what we say, the average Russian is going to join us in the streets when we have an
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.440]  uprising to come and take back our country, and then we're going to kill all the Ukrainians,
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.440]  I mean just crazy talk.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.880]  And he also said, look at January 6th, they almost hit the Capitol there, that wasn't
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.840]  us, that was the deep state trying to discredit the liberty movement legitimately and legally
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.160]  challenging things.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:24.120]  So Gorgon is an idiot, Gorgon's never even been in the military, he's never even been
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.520]  done research, he was just a rich guy that had a food catering company, he was an ex-con
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:35.600]  who kissed Putin's butt, and now you can see how good that was to have that sycophant there.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.720]  So my goal is not to kiss the rumpus of Obama's third administration through Biden or Vlad
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.920]  or be part of the system, it's to stop nuclear war and to do the best I can to get as many
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.760]  people to realize we're not fighting Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping or Barack Obama, they're
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.880]  just puppets of Satan, we are fighting the devil, and it's become increasingly obvious
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.720]  that all of that is the fact, but you've got to love some of these headlines here.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:07.040]  The CIA for about five hours yesterday before Gorgon stood down and ran off to Belarus was
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.000]  saying, oh, yes, we're taking sanctions off and we're not going to put sanctions on Wagner
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.160]  group now because they may work with us, as if Gorgon had a plan to work with the West.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.440]  Gorgon thought he'd make Putin step down and come in and make himself king, that's how
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.520]  dangerous all of this insanity is.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.920]  But no, the Wagner troops left the southern cities, they only got about 100 miles into
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.800]  Russia, 200 miles south of Moscow, and there's all the videos up on Infowars.com of the people
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:46.240]  cheering, cheering as Wagner left, cheering as the 30,000 remaining, half of them killed,
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:52.360]  60,000 total signed up, hardened prisoners, most of them convicted murderers, child molesters,
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:59.240]  you name it, being told to leave their cities.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.760]  But again, Putin said yesterday morning, I'm going to arrest and have Gorgon and all of
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.760]  them put in prison.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:10.360]  Oh, now there's amnesty for those that took part in the coup, and then they're going to
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.360]  have everybody else sign up in the military.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.920]  Is that keeping your friends close, your enemies closer?
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:19.320]  Regardless, everybody's watching over their backs, now Russia's sliding into totalitarianism
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:26.320]  even more, and now the West is basically forcing the country to become totalitarian.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.840]  Just like defunding the police, just like letting all the criminals out of jail here
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.160]  creates a crime wave, then the system will come in with draconian control for everybody.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.080]  Notice, nobody's checked at the border coming into the United States.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.800]  In fact, now they don't even DNA test unaccompanied children, they just turn them over to folks
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.520]  without even giving them a real ID or know who they are, so they can be abused, they
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.360]  can be trafficked, they can be disappeared.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.360]  See how it works?
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.320]  See how the plan operates?
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.800]  See how simple it is?
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.440]  Well, it's the same thing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.720]  They're forcing us into totalitarianism as the answer to the crisis they've created.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.980]  It's very simple.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:08.120]  That's why they create the hysteria, create the atmosphere to be able to carry this out.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.200]  Now before we go to break, I want to talk about what's happening here domestically.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:20.160]  I was playing the White House press secretary, the Raggedy Ann lady, and Jean-Pierre LePou,
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.800]  LePou, LePong, whatever her name is, whatever French name she's got, everybody's talking
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.880]  about her and how she got destroyed by the press in like 20 minutes.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.160]  They wouldn't quit asking her about why she was covering up and why she was doing all
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:39.000]  these things, and why Biden's son is an agent of the communists, and why it doesn't matter
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.080]  that he's his son, it's a family matter, all this.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:49.320]  But then Kirby got up, Kirby got up, and John Kirby had to walk off the stage, and
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.040]  he was just completely destroyed.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.220]  This is the collapse of the system.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.080]  This is the water carriers of the system not knowing what to do.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.240]  This shows how totally illegitimate it is.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.160]  But also the fact that the knives are out in the power structure for Biden, what does
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.160]  that signify?
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.760]  Who are they planning to replace him with?
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.600]  We'll go to the clip and come back after break.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:16.000]  House Ways and Means Committee yesterday released documents, their authenticity nowhere challenged.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.240]  That included a July 2017 WhatsApp message sent by Hunter Biden to Henry Zhao, a Chinese
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:30.880]  Communist Party official, which stated in its entirety, and I quote, I am sitting here
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.040]  with my father, and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.040]  Tell the director that I would like to resolve this now before it gets out of hand, and now
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.040]  means tonight.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.640]  And Z, if I get a call or text from anyone involved in this other than you, Zhang, or
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.200]  the chairman, I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me, and every person
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.760]  he knows, and my ability to forever hold a grudge, that you will regret not following
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.760]  my direction.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.600]  I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father, unquote.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.880]  So just a couple of questions about this.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.600]  First, does this not undermine the president's claim during the 2020 campaign, and the reaffirmations
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.840]  of that claim by his two press secretaries since then, that he never once discussed
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.960]  his son's overseas business dealings with him?
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.240]  No, and I'm not going to comment further on this.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.240]  We're good.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.240]  I'm not.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.680]  James, James, let me just let me save you some.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.560]  Let me say, let me say, let me save you some breath.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.680]  If you're going to ask about this, I am not addressed.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680]  I don't.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.600]  I know you do more than I'd like you to have.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.960]  I am not going to address this issue from this podium.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.960]  I'm just not going to do it.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.960]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960]  Thanks, guys.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.960]  Have a great weekend.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.960]  All right.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.960]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is the complete collapse of this gaslighting edifice.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.960]  These people are a joke.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.960]  The knives are out for Biden.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.960]  We'll talk about that and more.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.960]  We have a special guest.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.960]  Right ahead.

[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960]  Great ad.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.640]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.

[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.100]  Hey, what's better, knockout?
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.100]  What's better, down and out?
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.100]  What's better?
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.100]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.120]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.120]  people.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.160]  So one person might like this coffee.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.720]  Another person likes that coffee.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.640]  Another person likes that coffee.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.840]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840]  They're all very diverse.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.400]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years

[00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:03.800]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.480]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.160]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.840]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.840]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.040]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.840]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.680]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.680]  Rogan.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.160]  InfoWars are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.080]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.720]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.

[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.360]  please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.640]  We're barely hanging on.

[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.440]  at the same time at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440]  So don't procrastinate.

[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.640]  tyrants.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:05.040]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040]  supply.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:11.000]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.200]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.040]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.360]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.560]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.280]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:35.960]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.280]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:46.120]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:52.240]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:58.680]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.680]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.680]  Do you like RainForce?
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.680]  Yeah.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.680]  Yeah.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.680]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.720]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.680]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.040]  now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.360]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.280]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.280]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.680]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.720]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.520]  next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:42.200]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.200]  All right.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200]  We love you.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.240]  RainForce, RainForce, RainForce, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.240]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:05.620]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.620]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.620]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.620]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.620]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.620]  Well, we couldn't get a better guest on tonight
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.620]  unless maybe Scott Ritter, the former head UN weapons inspector,
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.620]  former one of the top advisors in the Pentagon
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.620]  during the major treaties that were done in the 90s
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.620]  with the Russians that have now all been broken by both sides.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.620]  Scott Ritter is coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.620]  Pastor Rodney Hard Brown will be in studio with another special guest
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.620]  coming up riding shotgun with us as well.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.620]  But Scott Bennett, Ph.D., U.S. Army Special Operations Officer,
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.620]  psychological warfare analyst.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.620]  I'm going to go over his whole bio, but he's been involved
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.620]  and run major operations around the world in the Middle East, Afghanistan,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.620]  and worked obviously with the whole CIA operations and all the rest here today.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.620]  But he also became a very famous whistleblower
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.620]  that exposed a lot of what was going on.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.620]  He's also a Russia expert, and that's all on record,
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.620]  so I'm going to stop there.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.620]  It's GlobalFreedomTV.com.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.620]  We appreciate him on short notice coming on.
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.620]  I'm going to give him the floor to give us his analysis of what he believes
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:27.620]  we just saw, just myself as a layperson that studies history.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.620]  Incredibly dangerous situation.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.620]  The spiral out of control is an example of how this war is escalating.
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.620]  People that are happy about this laughing, saying,
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.620]  kill Putin, put in Purgogin, just shows what lunatics they are.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:43.620]  Am I wrong to think Purgogin would be much worse than Putin, or am I wrong?
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.620]  No, you're not wrong at all, Alex.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.620]  You're right on the money.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.620]  I talk with Ritter, and I like him a lot, and I like McGregor a lot.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.620]  The guys in the know understand this.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.620]  I look at things from a psychological warfare perspective,
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.620]  which is a little bit different than artillery men and the rest of the components.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:08.620]  I look at the internal mechanism of the decision-making process
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.620]  and what's happening.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:15.620]  If we look at this Purgogin situation, it's like playing a roulette wheel.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.620]  We put money on different numbers.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.620]  Let's look at the number that, let's say this is real.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.620]  Let's say it was absolutely real.
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.620]  It was not dramatic.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620]  It was not a PSYOP.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.620]  It was not part of an information operation that Putin and Purgogin did
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:35.620]  to expose their enemies within, to expose who their friendly weather friends are
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.620]  and who their not-so-friendly weather friends are.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:45.620]  But if this was real, Alex, it was a laughable, grotesque, silly, childlike tantrum
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:50.620]  by Purgogin, a total miscalculation of the Russian character,
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:54.620]  the Russian hearts and minds, both in the Wagner group
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.620]  and the Russian military and the Russian political figures.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:05.620]  Purgogin, if this is real, if he did this because of his animosity towards Shoigu,
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:11.620]  if his pride and ego was offended by certain demands that were allegedly going to be
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:17.620]  put on him and Wagner, if all of that was real, it still says and proves
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:22.620]  that Purgogin made a terrible blunder in thinking that the Russian people
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:27.620]  were going to allow him and a ragtag group of Blackwater operatives
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.620]  that are probably better trained than Blackwater,
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.620]  but the Russian people would never have allowed Purgogin and the Wagner group
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:42.620]  to somehow overthrow Putin, overthrow Lavrov, overthrow Sakharova, overthrow everything.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:49.620]  So Purgogin, I think, led his merry band of men down a suicide alley,
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:55.620]  and if it wasn't for the temperament and the calm of Vladimir Putin,
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:01.620]  who I think is the master strategist and statesman of the world in the past 100 years,
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:07.620]  if it wasn't for Russia's temperance and patience and flexibility,
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:11.620]  Purgogin and all of them would be dead.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:16.620]  But Russia didn't want to go that route, but Purgogin still pushing up
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:22.620]  shows a terrible blunder because Russia is 100% behind Putin,
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.620]  they're behind the war against Ukraine.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.620]  It's also very sad because Purgogin, if this is real again,
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.620]  he destroyed every positive thing that his group did since 2022.
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.620]  Now I understand this is totally taken on a different color,
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.620]  Purgogin has been essentially ostracized, he's being re-translated out,
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.620]  whether he'll live long is another matter,
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.620]  but the Russians within Wagner didn't seem to understand what was happening,
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.620]  they didn't understand the orders, they didn't understand the full dimensions of this.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.620]  By the way, everything you're saying is true.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:59.620]  As soon as they learned that this was not popular and that they'd been lied to by Purgogin,
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.620]  they weren't fighting for him, they stopped in a matter of 12 hours.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.620]  I understand that Putin has been very calm through this,
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.620]  and the West did, they'll start this with George Soros,
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.620]  and he bragged on CNN five years ago that,
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.620]  yeah, I used $25 billion over the years,
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.620]  and $5 billion one year to overthrow Ukraine,
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.620]  and I'm really the czar of Russia now, that's a quote.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.620]  So they've been antagonizing Russia.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.620]  And of course Russia started in Ukraine, for those of you who don't know,
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.620]  and viewers, and so this is like New York leaving the Republic or something,
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.620]  and saying it's with a foreign country.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.620]  So we understand why the Russians did it, I get that.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.620]  My issue is, does this strengthen or weaken Putin?
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.620]  He put this down, it went away, it showed it was a joke,
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.620]  but still it can't look good that he said yesterday,
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.620]  Purgogin's going to be tried for treason, you're all going to jail,
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.620]  and a few hours later, okay, you can run to Belarus.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.620]  There's that facet that really doesn't matter, it's academic.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.620]  But what does this do to Putin, and what does the West do now,
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.620]  because they're all saying it shows Putin's weak.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.620]  If that's true, then you want to coup, most analysts say,
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.620]  and I want your view on this, and I tend to think this,
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.620]  you're going to get a more hardliner and somebody not as smart as Putin
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.620]  if you get rid of Putin.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.620]  So I don't see any of this escalation and mayhem and fiasco alley
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.620]  and death alley as good for anybody that wants stability in the world.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.620]  And so that means to me, if the globals are celebrating this,
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.620]  they're like a bunch of degenerate gamblers on methamphetamine
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.620]  and five bits of acid just betting the farm on one number.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.620]  It doesn't sound good to me.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.620]  Well, you're right, they are inflated with ego and excitement,
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.620]  like a big balloon that was swelling.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:38.620]  I just did an RT interview, and their ballooning excitement
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.620]  about a possible coup d'etat and overthrow of Putin
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.620]  was suddenly popped, and everything deflated in the West.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.620]  Blinken, Biden, European Union, the Nazi Earl Savant Leydon,
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:54.620]  all of these puppets in Europe completely fell apart,
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.620]  because what they were hoping was going to happen suddenly didn't.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.620]  It was settled, it was solved, it was moved over and migrated.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:07.620]  So in a sense, their deflated enthusiasm creates an opportunity
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.620]  for kinetic and soft power intrusions by Russia into the battle space.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.620]  That's why there's a PSYOP component here.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.620]  So the deflation and the lack of enthusiasm by the West
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.620]  is an opportunity to exploit.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.620]  Now, you're right, there's a dimension of this is a gamble,
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:29.620]  and this makes Putin look possibly bad, in a sense, by his own people.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:34.620]  But he also, in the settling of this, resurrects his statesman-like
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:41.620]  demeanor and character, and it reinforces his promise
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.620]  to carry the country through good weather and bad weather.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.620]  And this was a bad weather moment, but he carried it through.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:53.620]  Now, the transition to a different leadership may be coming.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:58.620]  I think you're going to have a much more kinetic soft power increase
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.620]  in the next few weeks and a month, as Ukraine has totally done.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.620]  The military's done.
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.620]  What do you mean for people that aren't experts?
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.620]  Hold on, people that aren't experts, Scott Bennett, like you,
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.620]  what does kinetic soft power mean?
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.620]  Well, kinetic power is tanks and bullets and bombs and mines
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.620]  and missiles and all of that, the hard killing and destroying
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.620]  of the enemy's personnel and structures.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.620]  The soft power is the messaging, the information operations,
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.620]  the healing, the bread crust, the food, the blankets,
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.620]  the strategic diplomatic communications that we mastered when I was
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:36.620]  in the army and elsewhere, that coordinates to the different
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:41.620]  European spaces of information dissemination that goes to the West
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:46.620]  and says Putin is not about what Colin Powell did to the Iraqi army
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:51.620]  in the first Gulf War by annihilating them along that freeway of death.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.620]  Putin could have done that, but he didn't.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.620]  The Russians didn't do that.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.620]  The Russians love their people more than they hate traitors.
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:03.620]  So it gives a compassion and a dimension of kind of love
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.620]  and tolerance to Putin.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.620]  This is so sophisticated what you're saying, Scott Bennett.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.620]  I played devil's advocate and said if he'd annihilated those troops
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.620]  on the highway of death, like how dumb is Purgosian to think
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.620]  he could send those troops up a 300-mile highway and that he would ever,
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.620]  I mean, that's like no chance.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.620]  That's totally insane.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.620]  He was hoping other Russians would join.
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.620]  Remember, he gave speeches last year in this saying,
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.620]  I'll have an uprising and we'll overthrow and I'll be the president.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.620]  Clearly a megalomaniac.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.620]  I mean, I think that's established.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.620]  And I was saying if I was Putin, I probably would have just said
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.620]  it was the clearest way to win.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.620]  Okay, 1,000 attack helicopters, we know they got them around that area.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.620]  Just kill these people.
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.620]  Can he then trust all these people to fold them into the Russian military
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.620]  now after they did this?
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.620]  No.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.620]  In fact, I made that comment that this is an opportunity to use the Wagner group
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.620]  like a better trained United Nations peacekeeper force.
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:43:00.620]  Use the Wagner group to occupy the conquered territories of Ukraine
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.620]  that belong to Russia anyway.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.620]  Give them houses and property like they gave the Roman legionnaires
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.620]  in the ancient days of the empire when they expanded.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.620]  So Wagner needs to be appeased.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:16.620]  Any animosity, any remnants of guerrilla ambitions needs to be squashed.
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.620]  And they can do that by saying, look, you fought well.
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:24.620]  You fought the Ukrainian fascist enemy, the Nazis covered in the Bandera tattoos.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:28.620]  Now go and take over the parts of Ukraine that own what we own in Russia.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.620]  You know, here is territory.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.620]  Here's real estate.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.620]  Set up Russian villages to serve as outposts, as police stations,
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:42.620]  as watchtowers to make sure no more American bioweapons laboratories
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.620]  are set up in Ukraine to do a COVID-20.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:50.620]  So there is a way to move Wagner into a post-conflict position
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.620]  as peacekeepers and observatory towers and intelligence gatherers
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:59.620]  and then transition more of the kinetic into the regular Russian army.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.620]  And I think you're going to have a combination of, again, soft power
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:09.620]  and striking Russian military kinetic power that will begin finishing
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.620]  and rolling back this conflict in the next month.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.620]  I don't agree with these alternatives.
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.620]  Well, that was my next point.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:16.620]  That was my next point.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.620]  And I don't know fully what happened here.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.620]  And I was speculating yesterday and said I didn't know.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.620]  But now even U.S. intelligence and the Russians are agreeing,
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:24.620]  Rogojin was on his own.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.620]  And I think you're saying he probably was on his own.
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.620]  It looks like the West did reach out during it, thinking he was going to win.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.620]  And we're saying we won't put sanctions on you.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.620]  We'll take them off.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.620]  So there was obviously a reach out to him.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.620]  But as soon as they saw –
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:42.620]  Here's what it does, too, Alex.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.620]  It shows the Ukrainians, because we didn't slaughter the Wagner groups,
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.620]  we won't slaughter you Ukrainian armies that frag your officers
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.620]  and come to our side.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.620]  We're not the murderers.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.620]  If we were killers, we'd kill all the Wagner people, but we didn't.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.620]  And neither will we kill you, Ukrainian soldiers.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.620]  We want peace.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:00.620]  We want you to come out from the military.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.620]  We want you to come out from the piano-playing penis Zelensky.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.620]  We want you to come out and rejoin Mother Russia
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.620]  as the Slavic brothers and cousins that you are.
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:15.620]  So this peace upon Rogojin, and Rogojin, if he's wise
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.620]  and wants to inherit some homes in Sochi by Putin and the rest of them,
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:24.620]  will say I was wrong, but it shows the magnanimity of Russia,
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.620]  the leadership and such.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.620]  And as they didn't kill me or my men,
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.620]  neither will they kill the Ukrainians.
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:34.620]  So there is, again, within SIOP layers of this,
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:40.620]  but it creates a very good opportunity for Russia to demonstrate compassion
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:46.620]  and soft power, civil affairs, put down your weapons and come to our side.
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.620]  We're not going to kill you.
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.620]  We didn't kill Wagner people.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.620]  I'll say this.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.620]  I'll say this.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.620]  I think you're giving a very deep analysis of this,
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.620]  and I hope you're right.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.620]  And as of this morning, I was really concerned
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.620]  as the West was celebrating this Putin's week.
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.620]  Now I'm seeing more and more analysts say, actually, this is not going well.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.620]  I want this war to end.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.620]  I'm on the Russian side.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.620]  I'm not on the European side.
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.620]  I'm on the Ukrainian side.
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.620]  I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war and having peace
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.620]  and stopping this and not paying $200 billion.
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.620]  More than $200 billion, but big picture.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.620]  I said yesterday before we knew what was happening,
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:22.620]  I said maybe this is the West with Rogojin because of the timing.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.620]  I think more of it's Rogojin seeing it as the time for him to make his move
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.620]  because Russia did stop the counteroffensive dead.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.620]  I mean, I'm, again, rooting for him, but I'd give him like a 98.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:35.620]  I mean, they destroyed the Ukrainians.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.620]  It's much easier to be on defense than it is on offense.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:42.620]  Obviously, if you know any basic military or infantry or tank,
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.620]  you need what, three times the force to take land that's defended
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.620]  versus the other way around.
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.620]  So here is their – we really know what's been going on for two months.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.620]  It didn't just start three weeks ago.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.620]  They destroyed half the equipment, but most of the personnel that know how to use it,
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.620]  they're best people to destroy it.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.620]  Now they've got their B and C team, they've got their backbench,
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.620]  and they don't want to go in against that Russian steel wall.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:10.620]  And so basically Russia succeeded in taking that area of eastern Ukraine.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.620]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.620]  And so this is a big Russian victory, and then the attempted coup happens.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.620]  That makes me think maybe it was the West with Rogojin,
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:23.620]  but it's also the right time for Rogojin, now that there is this real Russian victory
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.620]  that hasn't been declared yet, to move back and demand his piece of the pie
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.620]  and exercise his illusions of grandeur.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.620]  Or is there something else at play there?
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:36.620]  No, I think as a PSYOP guy, I look at it and say, you know,
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:40.620]  you're moving your hand over here and you're doing something with your other hand over here,
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:43.620]  and you're juggling at the same time.
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.620]  So this is very sophisticated, and the Russians are master chess players
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:53.620]  while the Ukrainians, their elevator doesn't go to the top floor.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:59.620]  As a people, as a group, I've known them, and they're like dogs chasing their tail.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.620]  The West is the same way.
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:07.620]  So this little flashback about, oh, my God, is Putin going to fall?
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.620]  Is there going to be a regime change? Is there going to be a coup d'etat?
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.620]  What's going on? Let's look at it.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.620]  The entire Western establishment and media have focused on this,
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:21.620]  which has taken their focus away from the Russian military strategic advances
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:25.620]  and kinetic operations and reinforcements and other things that they've done
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.620]  along the territory that they've already conquered and taken and reinforced.
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.620]  That's the real victory.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.620]  So I see this as Russia has taken this opportunity to, again, protect infrastructure
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:40.620]  like Zaporozhye, like its other dams, like the other things that we know they're going to try
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.620]  and do false flag attacks, the West and the CIA and the Mossad and the MI6.
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.620]  That was my next question, sir.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:51.620]  Scott Bennett with GlobalFreedom.tv,
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:56.620]  a former Army officer, psychological warfare operations guy, ran operations, you name it,
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:02.620]  and a major whistleblower that exposed the whole crime network famously into Congress.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.620]  We don't want to – I mean, I want this war to end, obviously.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.620]  I want stability.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:09.620]  We've got all the domestic things going on and stolen elections and open borders
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:13.620]  and ESGs and world government and pedophilia everywhere.
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.620]  And Russia is the perfect distraction.
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.620]  So I want to end it as quickly as possible to try to save our own republic.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.620]  I mean, I'll admit it.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:20.620]  I'm a selfless person.
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.620]  I really care about America.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:27.620]  And so how will the globalists try to grab victory from the jaws of defeat
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.620]  because they never give up?
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:33.620]  So what are the wild cards here we should be looking for?
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.620]  Well, they are fanatical.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.620]  They're a cornered mad dog.
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:41.620]  They're being poisoned by their own madness and lies.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:46.620]  They are alienating and ostracizing themselves from any decent human being
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.620]  in all of Western civilization.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:53.620]  Their transgender obsession with castrating children under the age of 12,
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.620]  puberty blockers, drag queen shows, Bud Light, Target, you name it,
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:04.620]  the whole sexual dysfunction and plague and anti-family madness
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.620]  combined with the climate change religion worship,
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:14.620]  that is becoming so toxic and disgusting to the majority of rational people
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:19.620]  that you're only having the most irrational given any credence.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:22.620]  And the most irrational, of course, are those in the Biden administration
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.620]  and those in some of these godless European countries
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.620]  that are pretty soon going to be eating bugs and freezing in the next six
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:32.620]  to eight to nine months as they suffer the consequences of cutting themselves
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:33.620]  off from Russian oil.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.620]  That's probably the greatest laughable geopolitical blunder
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:40.620]  that will cause French revolutions all over the European states.
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:44.620]  That is literally cutting your nose off despite your face.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.620]  Sorry.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.620]  The globalists, in a sense, are done, Alex.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.620]  You've said this wisely, too, and quite prophetically.
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.620]  They have lost all of the momentum of people.
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.620]  And there's a lot of dumb people that think,
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.620]  oh, well, maybe it's nice to be a globalist.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.620]  Maybe it would be good.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.620]  Now they're saying, no, it's not good.
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:03.620]  It's not nice.
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.620]  It's dead, deadly, toxic.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:09.620]  Noah Harari and the rest of these fools and their vaccine agenda,
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:13.620]  which was exposed as originating in Ukraine and the biolabs that were there.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.620]  I was part of the documentary that did it.
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:16.620]  All of that.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.620]  In fact, you were.
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.620]  Let's stop right there, because I saw you two years ago,
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.620]  before this broke, harping on biolabs.
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.620]  And I tried to get you on then, and it broke down.
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:25.620]  But you're here now.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:26.620]  How big is it?
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.620]  Because remember, a year ago, they said you and everybody was lying.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.620]  There was no biolabs.
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.620]  We had The Washington Post articles from 12 years ago,
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.620]  Biden opening them and celebrating it and saying they were doing it.
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:38.620]  But now they admit, okay, we've got to stay there,
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.620]  because Putin will get our biolabs.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.620]  So tell people about those labs.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.620]  Putin's already got the biolabs.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.620]  He's already got all the intelligence and the documents,
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:53.620]  and he's formulating legal cases that will charge these American
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.620]  and other interests with crimes against humanity.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.620]  They know that.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.620]  That's why they put it into the plot for the last James Bond movie, in fact,
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.620]  exactly what you had in Ukraine.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:07.620]  And it's funny, because the Death Factories documentary that we did
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:12.620]  happened I think it was a year and a half before Russia went into Ukraine.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:16.620]  So they've known about these biolabs a year and a half before they went
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.620]  into Ukraine in the special military operation.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:23.620]  Biolabs were established by the United States under Barack Obama,
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.620]  Dick Lugar in 2007.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.620]  They have grown exponentially ever since.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:31.620]  They were developing pathogens, diseases to weaponize,
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:36.620]  to send on aerosolized drones.
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.620]  Even the Washington Post, just to interrupt you, Scott Bennett,
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:44.620]  even the Washington Post admits they're developing pathogens 40 times worse
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.620]  than COVID and gain of function.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:51.620]  Imagine if Canada or Mexico had bioweapon labs on our borders.
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.620]  We would take it out instantly.
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.620]  So, again, why would the West start a fight like this?
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.620]  It's crazy.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:03.620]  Well, your depopulation agenda from the mad lunatics that occupy some of these
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:07.620]  Noah Harari, Klaus Schwab, George Soros, Bill Gates,
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:12.620]  bunch of pedophile raping Epstein Island devotees,
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.620]  they were behind a lot of this.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.620]  And a lot of the legal documentation that I've seen,
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.620]  I've seen the Pentagon documents, I've seen the slides,
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:25.620]  I've seen the implications that the USAID, CIA,
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.620]  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation,
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.620]  the Soros Organization, the Open Society Foundation,
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.620]  all of these big foundations that were globalists,
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.620]  Bill Gates' Project 201,
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.620]  the Russians have all of the documentation and the fingerprints
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.620]  and their participation in this and they're funding this,
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.620]  as well as Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson,
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.620]  and a variety of other groups that were in Ukraine using all of this research
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:59.620]  to then send back to Fort Detrick that found its way in Wuhan.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:03.620]  So, all of this originated in Ukraine.
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:07.620]  And Russia has gone in and taken these 46 biolabs
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.620]  that were also targeting Russian DNA.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:13.620]  They were developing weaponized pathogens
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:18.620]  to specifically strike the Russian DNA Slavic genetic code.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.620]  And all of that has been covered up by the mainstream media,
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.620]  it was covered up by the United Nations,
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.620]  because the United States, Britain, and France
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:29.620]  wouldn't allow an investigation into all of this material,
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:31.620]  all of these documents.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:33.620]  And by the way, let me interrupt you again, for those who don't know,
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:37.620]  race-specific bioweapons have been around for at least 60 years.
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.620]  Dick Cheney wrote a report for PNAC 24 years ago
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.620]  saying we should legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:47.620]  And they admit, well, they were guarding against race-specific bioweapons
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:52.620]  at these bio-shield labs in the US, Europe, Africa, all over,
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:56.620]  but, quote, covering up the illegal bioweapons labs under UN treaties
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.620]  by saying they're defensive, but they were making the pathogens.
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.620]  So, we're talking about race-specific.
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.620]  Explain race-specific to people.
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.620]  This should be a death penalty offense to be making this stuff.
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:14.620]  Well, you understand the different genetic structures of races,
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:17.620]  the Black race, the genetic dispositions of the Black race,
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:20.620]  or even the Hispanic races, at different times,
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:24.620]  their bodies and their physiological makeup
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:28.620]  has different reactions to sicknesses and vaccines, for example.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.620]  Judy Michovitz talked about this extensively,
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:36.620]  where vaccines are given to Black and Hispanics at a young age
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:41.620]  that causes enormous damage to their ability to resist certain sicknesses
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:47.620]  because of their different bodily growth and the hormonal changes.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:53.620]  That was one example of how the exploitation of different genetic sequences
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:57.620]  and structures of physiology in Blacks and Hispanics
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:01.620]  differ from Slavics or Scandinavians or Celtic or Germanic types.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:06.620]  So, the West, America specifically, was looking to target
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.620]  what is the Slavic DNA defined as?
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:14.620]  What are northern Russians in Moscow and St. Petersburg,
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:19.620]  in the Finland area, versus more of the Central Asian-Russian areas?
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.620]  What are their different peculiarities?
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.620]  What are they resistant to?
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.620]  What are their vulnerabilities that we can exploit?
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.620]  And they were using that, and it killed a lot of Ukrainians
[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.620]  in many of these experiments and stuff.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.620]  That's why Yanukovych, the president, said,
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.620]  get these labs out of my country.
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:40.620]  And they overthrew him when he said that.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.620]  He also said, I don't want the rainbow flag
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.620]  and the homosexual agenda in Ukraine.
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:47.620]  We're a Russian Christian Orthodox country.
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.620]  And the moment he said that, Barack Obama and his boyfriend,
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.620]  Michael Levon Robinson, also known as Michelle Obama,
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:57.620]  and the rest of the U.N. NATO lunatics,
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.620]  launched this great coup d'etat and overthrow of Yanukovych.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:03.620]  Let me interrupt you, Scott Bennett.
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.620]  I'm here. You're incredible.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.620]  Please join me again this week for a full hour, if you can, sir.
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:10.620]  I've got Pastor Rodney Howard Brown about to come in here in studio.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.620]  We've got to switch things around and have him get ready to be with me.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:15.620]  We've got other guest hosts coming up, Scott Ritter as well,
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.620]  from Russia, reporting on all this.
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:23.620]  Will you come back next segment and host the first five minutes of the hour?
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.620]  They'll just play the music, say you're live.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.620]  Will you host the five minutes, talk about whatever you want,
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:29.620]  so you can get more information out?
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.620]  I'm happy to, pal. Anytime I can help.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:33.620]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.620]  Thank you. All right.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.620]  Scott Bennett's going to host the next five minutes.
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.620]  We start the second hour on GlobalFreedomTV.com.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.620]  I'm InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.620]  Please buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:43.620]  That's how we fund the operation.
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:45.620]  InfoWarsStore.com. We'll be right back.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:54.380]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:58.380]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:03.380]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:07.380]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:12.380]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:14.380]  five, six, seven days a week.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.380]  It's really just incredible.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:20.380]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:26.380]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.380]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:33.380]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:36.380]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.380]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:42.380]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:47.380]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.380]  Please take action now.
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:57.380]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words planned for our future.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.380]  That is a hellish future.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:02.380]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:05.380]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.380]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:13.380]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.380]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:21.380]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:25.380]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.380]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:31.380]  You'll also know that you helped keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:35.380]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:41.380]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a signed copy
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:45.380]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:48.380]  This is an InfoWar. I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:56.380]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:11.380]  Well, it is always a wonder and a blessing to be on with Alex Jones and to be on with you,
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:16.380]  the American audience that represent the best and the brightest and the smartest people in the land.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:23.380]  So I'm very honored that Alex is kind enough to bring me on and to work with such wonderful people as Daria and others
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:26.380]  that really are the cutting edge of the news.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:31.380]  And I've done a lot of RT and Press TV interviews, so we'll be bringing you a lot of the footage on that.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:36.380]  But this is an exciting time, and I just want to encourage people to support Alex and InfoWars
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:40.380]  and to get the health supplements because we're entering a different phase in America.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:50.380]  The left and the lunatics and the demonic, demoniac Democrats and rhinos are going full bore with destroying the Constitution,
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:56.380]  destroying our rights, endless war, starting fights, starting conflicts that we need to really rise up,
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:00.380]  detach ourselves from the mainstream media, including portions of Fox,
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:06.380]  and get news and information from trusted sources and the analysis from trusted people.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:11.380]  So I just want to encourage people to continue to support Alex Jones and support InfoWars.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:15.380]  There are teams of people that are gathering from different areas.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.380]  We all share our love of country. We share our love of God.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:21.380]  I'm a very deeply faithful person who believes, you know,
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:26.380]  Blessed be the Lord my strength and teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:31.380]  This is a fight. This is a war of words, information operations, psychological warfare.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.380]  I don't believe Russia is an enemy of the United States or our people.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.380]  I've been there. I've also been to Iran.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.380]  I don't think Iran is an enemy of the United States or our people.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:46.380]  There are differences that we need to solve and diplomatically open up.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.380]  And I think President Trump, of course, was the best person.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:54.380]  It is the best person to do that. So we'll see how that falls together.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:58.380]  But be prepared for anything that is going to be coming.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:05.380]  Be prepared for Gavin Newsom to replace Kamala Harris, the walking puppet.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.380]  He doesn't know what her name is.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.380]  Be prepared for Gavin Newsom to replace Kamala Harris,
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.380]  and then be prepared for a potential Manchurian candidate scenario
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:17.380]  where they take out Joe Biden and try and blame it on a Trump supporter
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.380]  so Gavin Newsom could instantly become president.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:24.380]  That's the storyline in the Manchurian candidate.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.380]  I have a very suspicious heart when it comes to this.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.380]  And I could see the Democrats doing that because they can never win
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:34.380]  a free and fair election ever again.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.380]  We'll never have a free and fair election in this country
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.380]  so long as we have electronic voting machines.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:42.380]  And in Iraq, we had guys voting with paper ballots
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.380]  and dipping their thumbs into purple ink.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.380]  And we need to do that for America because there's nothing more sacred
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.380]  than your individual vote.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:55.380]  There's nothing more emblematic of your ownership of this country
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.380]  than your vote.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.380]  And it needs to be protected.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:02.380]  When I was in Washington for President Trump's analytics in 2020,
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.380]  we know the election was stolen.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.380]  I briefed General Flynn, I briefed Pat Byrne, I briefed Sidney Powell.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.380]  I was the one, in fact, who got General Flynn out of prison
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.380]  by giving him an amicus brief that exposed his law firm,
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:18.380]  Covington & Burling, as having direct connections to the Clinton, Obama,
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.380]  Biden terrorist financing that they did.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.380]  So that's one of the reasons General Flynn is free.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.380]  But there's a whole group of individuals that have been working
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.380]  behind the scenes fighting this.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:33.380]  And I'm very excited because I think the future belongs to all of us
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:37.380]  who are of traditional conservative constitutional values.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:41.380]  It's time to go out and win the Hindus and the Sikhs and the Chinese
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.380]  and the Asians that are living in this country,
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.380]  as well as blacks and Hispanics.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:53.380]  But we have to go and expand our message beyond Christian ecumenical thesis
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:57.380]  and go into reaching out to the people and the immigrants
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:00.380]  that may not be Christian as we define them,
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:03.380]  but they believe in traditional family values between men and women.
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.380]  They believe in the American dream,
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.380]  but they've just never discovered Infowars,
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.380]  or they've never discovered a lot of these messages.
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.380]  It's our job to go out and bring them in, to recruit them.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.380]  We have to build numbers and make these people our people
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:19.380]  and cleanse them from the lies the Democrats have been saying,
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.380]  which is every white person is a racist.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.380]  We know that's a lie.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.380]  So I just want to encourage people.
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.380]  We are winning.
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:26.380]  We are going to advance.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.380]  Pray. Pray without ceasing.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.380]  And go to your local officials.
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:37.380]  Demand that they stop some of the most terror that they are doing on your children.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.380]  We're out of time.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.380]  I encourage people to go to our website, destroy-cancer.com as well.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:46.380]  If you have cancers or tumors, that's something that can be very helpful.
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.380]  Destroy-cancer.com
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.380]  God bless you.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.380]  Thank you for supporting us.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.380]  God bless Alex Jones.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.380]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported Infowars
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.380]  financially and with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.380]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.380]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.380]  is because of you.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:15.380]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.380]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at infowarswar.com
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.380]  like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.380]  to take action now and be part of the global awakening,
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:52.380]  the new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:56.380]  by going to infowarswar.com and clicking on the Donate button and giving today.
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.380]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.380]  Please take action.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:12.380]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.380]  Bell Riding Shotgun with us is Tom Lampley,
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:22.380]  who's a great talk show host and former police officer, sheriff's deputy,
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.380]  and a now very, very popular for many years preacher with a big church here in Florida.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.380]  And I met him the other day.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.380]  I was already familiar with his show.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.380]  I'm really excited to invite him on the show tonight and invite him on the next few days.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.380]  And I'm here until Wednesday in Florida.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.380]  I'll be hosting the show.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.380]  And, of course, Rodney Howard Brown, my pastor.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.380]  I've said for 15 years I love him.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.380]  I've known him for around 10 years.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.380]  He's here with me.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:47.380]  I had an incredible day of just the most amazing church service I've ever been in
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.380]  in my 49 years on Earth.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:54.380]  We had Scott Bennett, former officer, PSYOP officer, U.S. Army,
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:59.380]  ran major operations around the world from Afghanistan to Iraq to Europe.
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.380]  He was on with this incredible guest.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.380]  Scott Ritter, former head UN weapons inspector, is going to be joining us.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:11.380]  And he was also one of the top advisors to Bush Sr. and others in Russia.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:12.380]  So he's a Russia expert.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.380]  He's been in Russia.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.380]  Been a lot of time there.
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.380]  Just got back.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:16.380]  He may still be there.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.380]  He just got back.
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.380]  But we'll talk to him in about 30 minutes from now.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.380]  So a jam-packed hour.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:25.380]  And then I'm going to leave here in about 55 minutes or less,
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:30.380]  and I'm going to walk over about 100 feet into this big, giant,
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.380]  it's either small or it's auditorium, but it's still huge and beautiful.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.380]  For me, it looks huge.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.380]  They've got a 10,000-person auditorium right here.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.380]  They've got a 4,000-person right there.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:42.380]  They've got like a 600-person or so right here.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.380]  We're going to have a night with Alex Jones.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.380]  He invited me.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.380]  You can check out all their feeds at Revival.com.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:52.380]  The feeds will also be at Infowars.com and BandOffVideo on this very feed.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:55.380]  So Sunday Night Live, we'll be Owen introducing it
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:58.380]  and then us for several hours giving short statements and speeches
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.380]  and then taking your questions.
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.380]  So, Pastor Howard, great to have you here, brother.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:05.380]  Great to have you in your own studio.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.380]  It's good to be here.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.380]  Good to have you, yeah.
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.380]  What do you make of since I've been here since Tuesday?
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.380]  I love it.
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.380]  I feel like I'm home.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:20.380]  Let me tell you, facilitating my friend here is like facilitating a catfarm hurricane.
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.380]  Seriously.
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:28.380]  It is like, you know.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.380]  But I think I've got it down pretty good.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.380]  I think I'm handling it okay.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.380]  You're doing a good job.
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:34.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.380]  What great people are on here?
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.380]  They're all phenomenal.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.380]  Everybody is.
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.380]  We've got Tom here.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.380]  He's a great guy.
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.380]  Another great, passionate, really smart guy on popular talk shows.
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.380]  Where do you want to begin with the craziness?
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:49.380]  I have countless videos in mainline pedophile parades.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:52.380]  That's what they are, LGBTPS, for Satan, literally now.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.380]  Literally saying, we're going to get your kids.
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.380]  They belong to us.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.380]  It's their official chance.
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:04.380]  We have the, quote, gay city-sponsored group in San Francisco saying,
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.380]  we're going to get your kids.
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.380]  We own them.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.380]  They're now showing up at city councils everywhere saying,
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.380]  we're going to have sex with your kids.
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:12.380]  What is going on with the devil revealing himself like this?
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.380]  Because if I was the devil, I would still be more covert.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.380]  His greatest trick was saying he didn't exist.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:19.380]  No, Target says we're going to cut Christians' heads off.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:21.380]  We're going to have sex with your children.
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.380]  We're a Satan cult.
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.380]  These are quotes.
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.380]  We're going to rape your children.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.380]  What has happened here?
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:26.380]  I think he's desperate.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.380]  He's totally desperate.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.380]  I mean, you can see what's taking place.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:34.380]  He realizes that his time is short.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.380]  We're going to play the audio, too, in a moment.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.380]  We don't just tell you stuff.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:38.380]  We're going to show it, though it's horrible.
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:40.380]  He realizes his time is short.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.380]  He knows that the church is rising up.
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.380]  That's what Revelation tells us.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:50.380]  At the end, the devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows his time is short.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.380]  He's throwing a fit.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:56.380]  Except he's trying to preempt what God has already set in place.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:01.380]  He's trying to get the reign of Antichrist, but this is actually the time of the body of Christ.
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.380]  I try to encourage everybody.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:04.380]  People say there's enough time left.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.380]  I say there's enough time for you to fulfill the mission God called you to.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:16.380]  Myself, Pastor Tom, and everybody that is involved in carrying the gospel around the world.
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.380]  There's enough time.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:22.380]  By the way, I've been to Pentecostal churches, loved them as a kid, but never, never, you know,
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.380]  when they do the Holy Ghost thing, passed out.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:29.380]  Today, not during that part of the service, but during the part about the Great Commission,
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:31.380]  I literally had plenty of water.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.380]  It wasn't hot.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.380]  It was great.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:34.380]  I felt great.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:35.380]  I was so energized.
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:36.380]  I was so strong.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.380]  I almost fell down.
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:42.380]  Well, I mean, there's times I actually hold on to the podium myself, and I'm very happy I have it.
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:45.380]  I can hold it, especially the big one in the sanctuary.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.380]  The other one, the middle one's still fine.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.380]  Those other flimsy ones, they don't really help.
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:50.380]  Well, that was it.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.380]  I had to say, Holy Spirit, you told me you're about free will.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:54.380]  Back off a little because I'm going to fall down.
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.380]  Yeah, but you know what?
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.380]  That's the problem.
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:02.380]  That's why God, when he wants to move, he really wants to touch people, but people get afraid,
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.380]  and they just say, No, I can't lose control.
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:09.380]  Instead of just giving the Lord total control, not be afraid, which will be fine.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.380]  You know what I mean?
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:14.380]  I mean, maybe everybody would be shocked.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.380]  Oh, my God.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.380]  What's happened to Alex?
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.380]  Well, I want you to come back on and talk about the Great Commission.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.380]  Yeah.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:20.380]  That was powerful.
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:21.380]  I was being literally enlisted.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:25.380]  I felt like that about 26 years ago, and I've been in my show a few years.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:28.380]  That restaurant alone at like 9.30 at night for a Mop It episode.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.380]  I've done a late night or later night show.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.380]  It was like 10 o'clock at night.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.380]  And I felt like I was signing on a commission.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.380]  I was signing on to a mission.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.380]  And this today was like 10 times stronger.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.380]  When I said, Yes, I want to be signed on.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.380]  I want the commission.
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:40.380]  It was like, Boom!
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:41.380]  I was like, Whoa!
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.380]  I was like.
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:46.380]  Well, look, the only hope for what we're seeing happen is the gospel.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.380]  There's no other hope.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:57.380]  We can't out-intellectualize and out-advertise and fight the giant media or whatever without
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:02.380]  a move of the Spirit of God where the wind of heaven blows because it touched people.
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:03.380]  God can flip things around.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:08.380]  Now, obviously, the Bible says in the last days, wicked men and evil men, the seducers
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:09.380]  will wax worse.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.380]  So that's going to take place.
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.380]  They're going to get worse and worse.
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:17.380]  But the righteous are going to get more righteous and bolder.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:22.380]  And you're going to see there's more of a showdown coming, light and darkness and stuff like
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.380]  that.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.380]  And of course, I mean, I was the first one.
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:28.380]  As you know, in 150 years, I get arrested because I kept the church open.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:32.380]  And, you know, everybody thought I was crazy, but I'm not crazy.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.380]  I just know what's coming.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.380]  And we prepared, you know, to get arrested again.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:41.380]  And I love your sermon today about the Davos group, because I read that last year and kind
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.380]  of forgot about it.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:47.380]  The Davos group said our main enemy is the churches and three things that stand in the
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.380]  way of their new lockdowns and forced injections.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:51.380]  So literally, you've got to.
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:55.380]  So the number one thing they don't want the church praying and they said, we're going
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:00.380]  to attack tongues because they don't want people praying with power, a hotline to heaven.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.380]  So we're going to attack tongues.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.380]  If you speak in tongues, you're a cult.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:08.380]  If you if you if you believe in healing and miracles, you are a cult because we don't
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:11.380]  want people getting healed because they won't need our vaccines.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:16.380]  And the number three, if you believe in prosperity and blessing of heaven, you're a cult.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:21.380]  And I can't believe that ministers actually went to Davos, signed on to that, came back,
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:25.380]  told their whole denominations, we're against tongues, we're against healing and we're against
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.380]  prosperity.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:31.380]  When I heard that, I told our church, OK, we we we believe in tongues, the baptism of
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:32.380]  the Holy Spirit speaking on the tongues.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:36.380]  We believe in healing, miracles, signs and wonders, and we believe in prosperity.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:39.380]  But now we're going to we're going to overemphasize it.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:44.380]  But don't you get you're being too too humble here.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.380]  You were the first major preacher.
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.380]  It was a huge international story.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.380]  They arrested you, blew up in their face.
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:51.380]  They had to back off.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:54.380]  You encourage all these preachers around the world, including in Africa, as you said, to
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:55.380]  not be on the lockdown.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:57.380]  They're directly talking about you.
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:58.380]  Basically, they want.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.380]  No, no.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:00.380]  They talk about me by name.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.380]  They're talking about you.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.380]  I know.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:03.380]  Well, that makes me so proud.
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:04.380]  They think, like, we're going to get you.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:07.380]  And I'm not like an arrogant person, but I want my John Hancock to be the biggest.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:10.380]  Because when they signed that, that was a death warrant to have your name the biggest.
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.380]  They were like, look at that arrogant guy.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:15.380]  Well, if I'm going to put my life on the line, I'm going to say I'm all in.
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:16.380]  Yeah.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:20.380]  Well, the attorney general then had me arrested as a Soros paid hack.
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.380]  So he was put here by Soros.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:24.380]  So where is he now?
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.380]  Persona non grata.
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:30.380]  So tell me about Tom.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:34.380]  Tom Lightly passes Foundation Church in what he's moved.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:39.380]  I mean, he actually took over one of these woke churches that was empty and he bought
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.380]  the whole property.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:43.380]  He's building exploded, running about 150 people.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.380]  And then he wouldn't shut down.
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:51.380]  And I only got to meet him because he was ranting against the whole system that had
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:52.380]  me arrested.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.380]  And he has his own talk show.
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:56.380]  And the church has run a thousand people.
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:57.380]  I've seen the show.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:58.380]  It's good.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.380]  So this is Pastor Tom Lightly.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:01.380]  Pastor Tom.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:07.380]  What was amazing to me was I actually because Alex is good friends with Joe Rogan.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:15.380]  I noticed that Joe Rogan saw the book of Revelation unfolding before the evangelical church did.
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.380]  That was what was truly amazing to me.
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:22.380]  I sat and watched Joe Rogan say this is the I mean, he's he publicly acknowledges that
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.380]  he's not a believer.
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.380]  Maybe he's going that way now.
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.380]  I hope he is.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.380]  But he publicly acknowledges, you know what?
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:31.380]  I don't really, you know, follow Christianity actually kind of mocks it at times.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.380]  But then he says, you know what?
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.380]  This is a little scary.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:36.380]  This is the book of Revelation unfolding right before our very eyes.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:41.380]  And what you know, for me, it's all about this entire the globalist bourgeois leftist
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:47.380]  elitist leveraging us into a one world commerce system with many different tactics, a one
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:51.380]  world commerce system with a singular access point controlled by tyranny and all these
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:57.380]  things, whether it's gun grab and climate, climate change, vaccines, vaccine passports.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:01.380]  Transgenderism is all to leverage us into that one world commerce system where they
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.380]  give you the access.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:05.380]  They they either take it from you or they give it to you.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.380]  And it's all a matter of whether it will stand or not.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:12.380]  Also, lawlessness, which we're seeing happen with with Alex, you know, the lawlessness
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.380]  is trying to ruin you, which it won't.
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:18.380]  By the way, I keep looking to my left because Alex is there, but it won't ruin you.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.380]  And I just I think of the I think of the verses.
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:23.380]  And Alex, you talked about this at the very beginning.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:28.380]  Let know it's in second second second Thessalonians, chapter two, starting in verse three and running
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.380]  through verse eight.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:34.380]  It says, let no one deceive you by any means for the for that day will not come the return
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.380]  that day will not come unless the falling away comes first.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:42.380]  Nobody on planet Earth outside of here at the River Church down in Northport with me,
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:47.380]  Jonathan Sheldon's worth of Pittsburgh and a few other people are actually even recognizing
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.380]  what we're going through right now.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:53.380]  Most evangelical churches today are preaching about, you know, love again for the 47th time
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:56.380]  accommodation, acceptance, whatever it may be.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.380]  And nobody's actually preaching against the Antichrist spirit.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.380]  And that's why we got to have Alex Jones.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:06.380]  I've always called Pastor Rodney the Alex Jones of evangelical Christianity.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:10.380]  We've got to have now Alex Jones be Alex Jones in evangelical Christianity.
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:14.380]  Well, this should be the greatest moment for real Christianity right now.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:19.380]  World government, ESG, Mark of the Beast, open Satanism, all of it fulfilled.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:22.380]  And I've been to like 10 churches in Austin trying to find one.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.380]  None of them will talk about it.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.380]  And they all know privately what's going on.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.380]  But it's too scary.
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:29.380]  Well, then you won't tell people what's actually happening.
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.380]  This is the greatest moment of truth right now.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.380]  But don't worry, it's going to get so bad, nobody's going to be able to deny it.
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:38.380]  You're going to get on your knees as Satan and sign your children over or you're going to join Christ.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:39.380]  It's easy.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:44.380]  Well, you know, the thing is that actually Jesus spoke about it in Matthew chapter 24.
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:48.380]  And he said at that time, many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:53.380]  Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people because of the increase of wickedness.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.380]  The love of most will grow cold, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.380]  That's Matthew 24, 10 through 13.
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.380]  And they won't actually recognize.
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:06.380]  People will put a mark on their right hand or on their forehead and attend church that Sunday.
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:09.380]  They actually will not recognize it because it's like you said, Alex.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.380]  Nobody is actually preaching the gospel to these people.
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.380]  Nobody is actually telling them this is the Antichrist spirit.
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:21.380]  Most people in the church cannot decipher between the Holy Ghost and the prince of the power of the air.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.380]  They actually cannot.
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.380]  They actually believe that it's loving to put a mask on.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.380]  They believe that it's loving to lock down.
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.380]  To stand six feet apart.
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:35.380]  That basically a Pfizer executive, Scott Gottlieb, made up out of thin air as part of Trump's COVID response task force.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:41.380]  But the thing is, the love of most will grow cold, but he who stands firm to the end.
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:43.380]  You have to let your yes be yes and your no be no.
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:48.380]  You have to be able to recognize this is the prince of the power of the air or this is the Holy Ghost.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:55.380]  And one of those tactics, and I have to bring this up to you, is the verses that I was reading to you out of 2 Thessalonians.
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.380]  Chapter 2, starting in verse 8.
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:00.380]  Let no one deceive you by any means.
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:02.380]  For that day will not come unless the following way comes first.
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:05.380]  And a man of sin has revealed the son of perdition.
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.380]  The man of sin has revealed the son of perdition.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.380]  Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.380]  Now you know what is restraining.
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.380]  That he may be revealed in his own time.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.380]  For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work.
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.380]  And that's what's happening with you.
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:25.380]  Basically what they're doing now, whether it's Alex Jones with his civil lawsuit, but they'll come after your criminal if they can.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:28.380]  Whether it's the mystery of lawlessness is already at work.
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:33.380]  Lawlessness is one of those tactics of the globalist one world leverage you into a one world country.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:36.380]  And when you think of lawlessness as a robber on the street, you mean the courts being lawless.
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.380]  Correct, correct.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.380]  It's actually both.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:42.380]  They're institutionalizing lawlessness on the streets.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:46.380]  Where you have, if you just look at any, whether it's Portland, whether it's Seattle, whether it's Washington, D.C.
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:51.380]  They just tried to get General Flynn and his civil lawsuit to be heard in Washington, D.C.
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:54.380]  And they defeated that in court, so they're keeping it in Florida.
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:58.380]  The reason why they want it in Washington, D.C. or whether they want it in Austin, Texas.
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:06.380]  You have a blue court, a blue jury, a blue grand jury, a blue judge, a blue prosecutor, a blue jury pool, a blue jurisdiction.
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.380]  You have absolutely no choice.
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.380]  And again, juries are another form of voting like grand juries.
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.380]  They're rigging it all.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:13.380]  So here's an incredible example.
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:20.380]  Three months ago, the Davos Group in Dubai, with all the major world leaders, has a world government summit.
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:21.380]  It's called World Government.
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:28.380]  And they announced, Naval Harari, who is their high priest, and Posquab say, we don't believe in God.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.380]  These are quotes, but we're about to be gods.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.380]  And you will join our A.I. system or you will be destroyed.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.380]  They said the future's not human.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.380]  These are actual quotes.
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:40.380]  And Elon Musk knows the script's flipping against him.
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:45.380]  Whether he's good or bad, he's at least trying to publicly say he's against it.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.380]  We can debate why.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:50.380]  He said, no, we need to have firewalls in different countries, different systems.
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:55.380]  We don't want a world government to make people do what you want to do that.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:21:05.380]  So we have open world government saying you will have an A.I.-controlled ESG score, global central bank digital currency system that tracks where you go, what you do.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:10.380]  And if you don't submit to us politically and do what we say, they can always move the goalposts, which they will.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:13.380]  We will take your right to buy and sell and live away.
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:17.380]  That is literal manifestation of the book of Revelation in your face.
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:20.380]  And I have been to dozens of churches the last two years.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.380]  In Austin, none of them are talking about it.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:28.380]  Literally the fulfillment in your face 2,000-plus years later.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.380]  The absolutely – people think Alex Jones was right.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:33.380]  Alex Jones predicted it while it was happening.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:34.380]  That wasn't hard.
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:37.380]  But no, God told you thousands of years ago exactly.
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.380]  So I'm nothing.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.380]  That's like Alex Jones predicts stuff.
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:44.380]  I'm reading their own battle plans and telling what's going to happen.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:45.380]  They do it.
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:53.380]  It would be like if I had the enemy's football, if I had the playbook, and then I was broken into their radio frequency and hear their call and display.
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.380]  That goes on the NFL TV.
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:00.380]  I'm not psychic because I've broken into their feed and I've got their playbook.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.380]  That's what Alex Jones did to the globalists.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:05.380]  God told you thousands of years before what they would do.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:07.380]  They're doing exactly what God said.
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.380]  That's right.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:10.380]  And we just sit back and the church is silent.
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.380]  That's right.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:13.380]  Yeah, they don't even know.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:15.380]  I mean that's the only – because nobody has preached it.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.380]  And that really – I've been hearing you preach the Bible for a long time.
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:20.380]  You reference it and you've been predicting.
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:27.380]  But who opposes and exalts himself, which you're talking about Noah Harari, opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped.
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:28.380]  He says I don't believe in God.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:29.380]  I'm going to be a God.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.380]  That's right.
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:35.380]  And he sits as God in the temple of God showing himself that he is God, which is the abomination of desolation.
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:36.380]  Desolation.
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:37.380]  Right.
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:38.380]  So this – we see it unfolding.
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:39.380]  But no Christians – Christians don't –
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:40.380]  That's Daniel.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.380]  Talk about abomination of desolation.
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.380]  This is key.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.380]  When they start saying there was no God but now there is a God and it's me.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.380]  That's right.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:47.380]  And that's how you know.
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:50.380]  And when you see these people that are actually – whether it's Noah Harari or many others
[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:56.380]  coming up and they're now setting themselves up as AI gods where they can see everything.
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.380]  They want to be omnipotent.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.380]  They want to be omnipotent.
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:01.380]  Elon said three years ago beware of those that say they're AI gods.
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:02.380]  That's right.
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:03.380]  Because he's been around these people.
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:04.380]  What do you think has happened with Elon?
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.380]  Do you think he's a double player?
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:11.380]  My opinion about Elon Musk is that I think he's – and sometimes I think he's a pragmatist
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:14.380]  where he just wants to – he wants to be successful.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:16.380]  He wants to reach all areas.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.380]  He wants to reach evangelicals.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.380]  I agree.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.380]  He wants full spectrum dominance.
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:21.380]  He's trying to be.
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:22.380]  He's trying to do that.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:26.380]  But he's too much – he's too engrossed with the CCP.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.380]  There's too much money involved with the CCP and Tesla.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.380]  I don't fully trust him, but I think there's hope with him.
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:33.380]  I agree, though.
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:37.380]  GCP, I feel like he was – the second coming was very creepy two weeks ago.
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.380]  Yeah.
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.380]  I mean, I hope Elon does well.
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:45.380]  There's still – I mean, putting Yacarino in charge of Twitter.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:46.380]  W-E-F.
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:47.380]  I mean, yeah.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.380]  I mean, you're looking at a W-E-F.
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.380]  What do you think about all this, Pastor?
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:53.380]  I think Elon is from South Africa.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.380]  So he's kind of a – I'm from South Africa.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:58.380]  So I think Elon sees things a little differently.
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.380]  Obviously, I'm not in this hope to live on Mars.
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.380]  The last thing I want to do is leave the Earth.
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:07.380]  There ain't no way I'm going to go live on some red planet with no water and ocean
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:08.380]  and –
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:09.380]  You're like Florida, yeah.
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:14.380]  I'm staying on the – I want to see palm trees and green and some golf courses.
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:15.380]  I'm not interested.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:18.380]  I'm not interested in some red planet.
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:21.380]  So – but that's what he wants to do.
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:24.380]  Bottom line, I mean, I think he's a genius.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:28.380]  But I think he also realizes that Americans are being smoked.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:35.380]  And, I mean, I don't think you go just drop $46 billion to buy a media company for free speech
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.380]  if you didn't believe that people should have free speech.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.380]  So for that, I'm happy.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.380]  How long we have it, we'll see.
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:43.380]  We are pushing envelope.
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:47.380]  I mean, I slam it all the time, even though my whole following on Twitter has been choked.
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:49.380]  You know, they've kept me at a level.
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.380]  Although, from the time Elon took over, I think I was stuck at about 50,000.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:57.380]  I think I'm sitting at over 60,000 or 67,000, whatever as well.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:00.380]  Well, you still have to dig out the people in there that control it.
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:01.380]  Basically.
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.380]  Basically, yeah.
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:04.380]  So, no, I mean, I pray for Elon.
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:09.380]  I pray for him much that – you know, I pray he doesn't go take the first trip to Mars
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.380]  and then go blow himself up.
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:15.380]  You know, we don't kind of need that like the guys last week with the Titanic.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.380]  But who knows?
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:20.380]  As I said on my show this morning, how do we know they really went?
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:21.380]  What do you make of Biden?
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:25.380]  Because everybody can look at the Kirby clip and the others where now the media is allowed to attack.
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:26.380]  So I don't like Biden.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.380]  I don't like Kirby.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:28.380]  I don't like any of them.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:33.380]  But they're allowed to attack now to get Biden down and clear the way for Big Mike or Gavin Newsom.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:34.380]  What do you think about that?
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:41.380]  I mean, I personally wish that he just run another four years in office.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:43.380]  I think to me, I mean –
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:44.380]  He's discrediting him.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:46.380]  Basically, that's what they're doing.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.380]  McCarthy, don't interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves.
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:54.380]  Yeah, but I mean, Biden really is only doing what his handlers are telling him to do.
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:56.380]  So he's actually a harmless old guy.
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:58.380]  He should really just be in a home, you know?
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:03.380]  I mean, if Don Rickles got a hold of Joe Biden and said, hey, Joe, I called the home.
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.380]  They said your room will be ready next Thursday.
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:10.380]  So I feel sorry for – I feel sorry because it's like elder abuse.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:13.380]  And I'm not pushing up all the crimes and all the stuff that's been happening.
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.380]  But I mean, the crime –
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.380]  Right now, he's not home.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:19.380]  He's basically a walking zombie.
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:21.380]  The elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor.
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:23.380]  I don't think the elevator works with Biden.
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:27.380]  It's not like he's a fork short of a set.
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:29.380]  There's no utensils here.
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:31.380]  I mean, I watch his full speech now.
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:33.380]  It's all bumbling insane asylum.
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.380]  But I love that.
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:36.380]  I mean, to me, that's like entertainment.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:39.380]  You're a saint.
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.380]  I mean, if you think about it, let's say he made total sin.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.380]  And let's say he was doing what he was doing.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:46.380]  Then what do you do?
[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:47.380]  No, I agree.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:48.380]  Like, look at Obama.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.380]  Obama was the great orator and whatever.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.380]  And we said, you've got to be kidding me.
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:54.380]  Now we've got a bumbling –
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.380]  No, I agree.
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:56.380]  What else is on your radar?
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:58.380]  What do you think about, Tom or you, Pastor?
[01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:03.380]  What about just the Russia thing and all this craziness?
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:11.380]  Well, for me, when it comes to what's happening in Russia,
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:22.380]  it was – to me, it was all predicted a while ago.
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:26.380]  I mean, if you see the various interweavings,
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:29.380]  it's hard to actually have a beginning in it.
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.380]  If you look at – if you're going with Ukraine and Russia right now,
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:39.380]  if you look at the interweavings with Hunter Biden, with metabiota inside of Russia,
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:45.380]  I mean, inside of the Ukraine, it was basically, to me, all coming out.
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:53.380]  And this is all basically a cover-up for the various interests inside of Ukraine,
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:54.380]  whether it's the Bidens –
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:55.380]  Absolutely.
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:58.380]  They couldn't afford to lose Ukraine because it would bring down Obama and the CIA.
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:01.380]  Using Ukraine for decades as their money laundering piggy bank.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:02.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.380]  You know about Israel, where a lot of money laundering goes on for the West.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:08.380]  I say this should be investigated, but Ukraine is one of the biggest places this is going on.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:11.380]  All right, Tom, how do people find your work?
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:16.380]  First of all, you can find me at Foundation Church in Northport, Florida.
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.380]  That's really where I'm based out of.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.380]  Tom Lively Podcast.
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.380]  You can just type it in anywhere.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.380]  It'll pop up.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:25.380]  That's L-A-I-P-P-L-Y dot com.
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.380]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:28.380]  Join me again before I leave Wednesday afternoon on the show.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.380]  Tuesday or Wednesday.
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:30.380]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.380]  Pastor, ride shotgun with us, all right?
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:34.380]  No, we're going to have fun tonight.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:35.380]  It's going to be awesome.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.380]  Well, don't leave yet.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.380]  We have 30 more minutes of Scott Ritter, the former head of U.N. and Web of Inspectors, coming on.
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:40.380]  We're going to talk to you more.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:43.380]  And then we end in 35 minutes or so.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.380]  I'm going to do this big special night.
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:48.380]  It'll be streamed at Infowars.com and Revival.com.
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:50.380]  And you're going to put out on all these different satellites.
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.380]  Yeah, we're on the normal satellite feeds that we are normally on.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:55.380]  This place is like the good Death Star.
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:56.380]  It looks like the Death Star around here.
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.380]  Storm troopers, everything.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:05.380]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:07.380]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:08.380]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:11.380]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:16.380]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.380]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.380]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:24.380]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front.
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:27.380]  They're in a mugshot jail background.
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:28.380]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:32.380]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:34.380]  We also have Alex Yost for president.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:35.380]  No, I'm not running for president.
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.380]  It's a really nice navy blue, high-quality shirt.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.380]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.380]  Alex Yost for president.
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:40.380]  $20.24.
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.380]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:44.380]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:56.380]  So get your Alex Yost for president and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowarsstore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:59.380]  Turbo Force is back.
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.380]  Sold out for eight months.
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:03.380]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:05.380]  We made it even stronger.
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:09.380]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:16.380]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:22.380]  And it's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:24.380]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:31.380]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything.
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:35.380]  And are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:38.380]  It is the super fuel.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:40.380]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.380]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:42.380]  There are two different nootropics.
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:43.380]  They go good with this.
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:45.380]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:47.380]  This is the boss.
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.380]  Turbo Force.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:49.380]  Back in stock.
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:50.380]  Discounted.

[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:07.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:19.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:26.440]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:31.440]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:34.440]  I'm here at the incredible International Media Complex,
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:39.440]  crowds of thousands and thousands today to hear Pastor Rodney Howard Brown speak.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:44.440]  And earlier, we had a great analyst on Scott Bennett,
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.440]  Army psychological warfare expert, run major operations,
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.440]  laying out his take on what really just happened yesterday,
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:55.440]  that incredibly dangerous, in my view, fiasco in Russia,
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.440]  in Western Russia.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:00.440]  But we could not have a more prominent expert
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:06.440]  who worked on the anti-nuclear treaties, weapons treaties,
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.440]  one of the chief negotiators, chief military guys on the ground.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.440]  He was in the head UN weapons inspector in Iraq that exposed they were lying about WMDs,
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.440]  trying to stop that war.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:19.440]  He is Scott Ritter, former Marine intelligence officer.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.440]  I won't go over his bio because it will take too long,
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.440]  but we cannot have a better guess.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.440]  Real Scott Ritter on Twitter, ScottRitterExtra.com.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:34.440]  He wrote excellent articles, really, when this whole coup started 48 hours ago,
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:39.440]  or 40 hours ago, predicting what would happen, that it would not give up,
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.440]  that it was a desperate gambit to get all these outside groups to join him.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:47.440]  So was it a Western-backed coup, or was it just his ego,
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.440]  and does this weaken Putin, and will this help end the war?
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:52.440]  What does all this mean?
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:56.440]  And Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is a founder of churches all over the world,
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.440]  major churches in Russia.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.440]  He's been to Russia many times.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.440]  I was on the phone with him this morning.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.440]  I was talking to his Russian churches,
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:06.440]  and they said this has made Putin stronger, this happening.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:10.440]  I kind of see it making him weak of his precaution he let do this.
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.440]  Just to me, I just want to stop him.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.440]  Here's what they're saying.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:18.440]  They're saying Putin let him flush out so that everyone could see who was disloyal.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:22.440]  And that's what they said that Putin was, a strategist.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.440]  He told me, he said, they were in the city yesterday.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.440]  He said it was like a normal day in Moscow.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.440]  There were tanks and stuff like that.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:33.440]  But he said the majority of the people are behind Putin.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.440]  So how can he be getting weaker if the majority of the people are behind him?
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:42.440]  What he did, he allowed the guy to play his hand, and now the guy is shot.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:48.440]  And then he could also, it could expose the people that are loyal to Bogosian.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.440]  And then they're going to be dealt with.
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.440]  I mean, that's the thing.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.440]  Like you said, he's going to Belarus now.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.440]  But if he's going to live, who knows what the story's going to be.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:03.440]  But the bottom line is, I mean, this was from a key pastor in the city of Moscow.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.440]  And he's been there for many years.
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:10.440]  So he just told me, when I summed it up to him, he said, boy, you got the thing right.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.440]  But we'd already been talking about it.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.440]  So I knew that, you know, what was taking place.
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:17.440]  I was actually just reading.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.440]  Scott Ritter, this is incredible.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.440]  Because, again, you were South African when the Soviets were there.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.440]  Let me just tell the network something.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.440]  You guys are running a feed of me ranting into my ear.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.440]  And I love you to death.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.440]  Can you check the board and just stop that feed to me?
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.440]  I kind of ignored it for two minutes, but I can't do it anymore.
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.440]  Okay, so maybe it's from here.
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:39.440]  I don't know.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.440]  It could be us running it.
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.440]  It's no big deal.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.440]  Why are we running the pre-roll, guys?
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  Please.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.440]  All this put together is so complex.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.440]  We're lucky we're even on air.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.440]  All right, but listen here.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:48.440]  Go ahead.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:51.440]  I'm not sure who this person is, but I was just reading this before we went on air.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.440]  It said, after the dust started to settle, the noise faded.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.440]  Let me give you my view.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:57.440]  This person is obviously from that area.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.440]  Boghossian tried to seize power.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.440]  He prepared for this for a few months.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:05.440]  He lied about the amount of ammo provided so he could stockpile for his coup.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.440]  He waited for the offensive starts of Russian armies focused on stopping the enemy.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.440]  Then he struck.
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.440]  He spread the news about Russian army collapsing.
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:17.440]  That's because he wanted a retreating Russian army and a nation looking for someone to blame.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:23.440]  If the defensive lines would have broken, the usual doomers would have all been outraged,
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:27.440]  and many people would have been looking for someone responsible, like the last autumn.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:33.440]  In that situation, Boghossian would step up and lead his Wagner heroes to stabilize the nation.
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.440]  He was the savior, a man that rescues the day.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.440]  But the Russian army held.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:44.440]  As the Ukrainian horde struck, the Russians fought, dug in, refused to retreat or break.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.440]  The Air Force worked around the clock.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:51.440]  The intelligence was good, and high-ranking Russian generals were in forward observation points
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.440]  exactly where the Ukrainians attacked, commanded the battle,
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.440]  and the defense Russians and reinforcements were ready.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.440]  They counted where it was needed.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.440]  The Ukrainians were smashed again and again.
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.440]  So why start the coup?
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.440]  Boghossian was already committed.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:05.440]  He was afraid of the leaks from his people.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:09.440]  He was afraid of the Russian FSB would smell him out, so he had to move.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.440]  He had to start his grotesque query.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:18.440]  He struck at a precise moment when all defenders of the motherland
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.440]  were holding back the enemy behind their backs.
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.440]  Is this what the passers-saw?
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.440]  No, no, this is what I just saw on the Internet, so I'm just reading.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:29.440]  He made a fake video of some stupid trample of a forest that was supposed to be a missile strike,
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.440]  but the forest was green and not scorched.
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:35.440]  Another missile strike was presented, but the crater was not round but square,
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:38.440]  with two fires lit up at the bottom of the square.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.440]  It convinced almost no one.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.440]  But at this point, there was no turning back for Boghossian.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.440]  He spread the information about Pogrom on the front lines,
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.440]  that the Russian army had lost enormous territory.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.440]  Let's go back to this because I want to get your take on it.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.440]  But Scott Ridders just got back from Russia.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.440]  He's in New York, former head, U.N. weapons inspector.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:01.440]  You were there getting these peace treaties, getting anti-nuclear weapons treaties done.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.440]  So you're a Russian expert.
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.440]  What do you make of what's going on?
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:15.440]  Well, I think Russia had a problem that Machiavelli spoke about back in the day.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:20.440]  He said, don't align yourself with mercenaries.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.440]  Wagner was created in 2014 to do a specific task,
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:31.440]  and that was to facilitate the provision of military training, equipment,
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:39.440]  and some supervision to the ethnic Russian resistance against the Ukrainian nationalists
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:47.440]  that seized power through the Maidan revolution in February 2014.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.440]  They do that because the soil that they're operating on wasn't Russia.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:40:00.440]  Russian law prohibits a private military contractor from operating on Russian soil.
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:05.440]  When these territories were annexed by Russia in September of last year,
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:12.440]  after the referendum, the Wagner group no longer had a legal basis to operate on.
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.440]  This was problematic.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:16.440]  Now, they were heavily engaged in combat,
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:21.440]  and so the Russians allowed this to continue until the battle for Bakhmut was finished.
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:28.440]  But the Russian government made it clear that Wagner was going to have to comply with the law,
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:33.440]  which means that the day of this independent mercenary force was over.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:37.440]  They would have to sign contracts, get absorbed into the Ministry of Defense, et cetera.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.440]  Purgoshin is one of the owners, took umbrage at this.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:44.440]  It would lose him a money-making machine.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:48.440]  He had elevated Wagner's status.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.440]  They were superheroes in Russia.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:59.440]  Prior to this fiasco, every major city in Russia had billboards up there advertising Wagner for recruiting.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:05.440]  The Wagner group was held on a higher level than even the Russian army,
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:10.440]  treated as heroes, the heroes of Bakhmut, et cetera.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:16.440]  And so I think Purgoshin believed that this was the Russian government,
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:21.440]  the Ministry of Defense was conspiring against him, and so he concocted this coup.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:32.440]  There's every reason to believe that Purgoshin's actions were linked to specific actions of the Ukrainian government
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.440]  and indeed the collective West, in particular British intelligence.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:40.440]  So you're saying he may have been coordinating?
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:43.440]  Are you saying that he may have been coordinating with them?
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:49.440]  Well, what we do know is this, that British intelligence was briefing the prime minister several weeks ago
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:52.440]  about Purgoshin's planned coup.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:53.440]  They knew about it.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.440]  The CIA briefed Congress about the coup.
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.440]  They knew about it.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:03.440]  The British coordinated with the Ukrainians to go into an operational pause.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.440]  If you remember, that happened a couple days ago, and wait until the coup started.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:15.440]  The goal of the coup was to compel the Russians to withdraw troops from the front line,
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:17.440]  and then the Ukrainians would then go on the attack.
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:19.440]  The British had coordinated this.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:22.440]  The British are telling Zelensky to pause, to wait.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:27.440]  So they're acting as if there was coordination.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:34.440]  Now, this could just be good intelligence, and Purgoshin didn't realize that he was being used in this fashion.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:41.440]  Or Purgoshin, who exhibited all the red flags that one would expect of somebody who was susceptible to being recruited,
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.440]  anger, narcissism, greed.
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:48.440]  He had business dealings that had collapsed in St. Petersburg.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.440]  He was desperate for money.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.440]  So all the things suggest that he was susceptible to recruitment.
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:55.440]  There's no proof of that yet.
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:00.440]  But we do know that the United States and Great Britain were aware of this coup
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:03.440]  and were coordinating military actions in response to this.
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:10.440]  And we also know that Purgoshin began reading from a Ukrainian script as soon as he announced this coup.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:16.440]  He started spouting out nonsense about the line collapsing, excessive dead,
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.440]  everything he could say to demoralize the Russian troops.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.440]  And the Russian military lied.
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:23.440]  The war was wrong.
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  I mean, clearly, he was literally spouting a NATO line.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.440]  This is insane.
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.440]  100% insane.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.440]  So now he starts his adventure.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:41.440]  I also believe that he was, again, in contact with oligarchs who are operating out of London under control of British intelligence.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.440]  Whether or not Purgoshin understood what was happening, again, we don't know.
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:47.440]  I'm sure we will find out.
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:53.440]  But he was led to believe that if he initiated this march on Moscow,
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.440]  that Russian generals and Russian politicians would rally around his cause.
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:01.440]  This reminds me of Kennedy being told,
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.440]  this reminds me of Kennedy being told,
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.440]  Bay of Pigs and the Cubans will join us.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.440]  It's a setup.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.440]  It's like, go try this, see what happens.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:12.440]  So he started, and what he found is the exact opposite.
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.440]  Everybody rallied around Putin.
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:15.440]  And here's the important thing.
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:22.440]  Now, people talk about this negotiated settlement between Purgoshin and Lukashenko, the president of Belarus.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:26.440]  Let's just be realistic about this.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:33.440]  Purgoshin went into Russia with about 4,000 to 5,000 guys, not 25,000, 4,000 to 5,000.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:40.440]  They were in convoys on major highways, which means they had a limited predictable axis of advance.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.440]  Their vehicles needed fuel.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.440]  So if they began maneuvering, they would run out of fuel.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.440]  Then he would be stuck with no ability to maneuver.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.440]  Limited ammunition, limited food.
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:55.440]  This is a recipe for disaster if there's any resistance.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:58.440]  And Putin had stood up.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:02.440]  I mean, the speech Putin gave, and this is why I don't buy into the Game of Thrones stuff.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:07.440]  Everybody talking about this master game, this clever thing.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:09.440]  First of all, superpowers don't play Game of Thrones.
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:11.440]  Superpowers are supposed to be stable.
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:16.440]  Putin just came from the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum,
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:22.440]  where hundreds of billions of dollars of contracts for foreign investment in Russia were signed.
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:26.440]  These people signed those contracts because, A, the Russian economy is booming,
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  and, B, they believe that Putin had created a very stable environment for investment.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:37.440]  So why would Putin sacrifice hundreds of billions of dollars of contracts
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:41.440]  to demonstrate to the world that Russia is a banana republic?
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:48.440]  Because only banana republics have mercenary armies launch a run on the capital with an armed insurrection.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:51.440]  This is not normal, and Putin is about normal.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:55.440]  If you saw the anger in Putin's speech, he was furious.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.440]  This wasn't a game.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:03.440]  He was very upset about what had happened, and he had taken the gloves off.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:08.440]  You know, Pugoshin was confronted with the fact that there was about 2,000 Russian special forces
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:15.440]  assembling south of Moscow who were getting ready to engage the lead elements of his convoys,
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:22.440]  and 10,000 Chechen Ahmad special forces had just surrounded Rostov
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.440]  and were awaiting the orders to go in and clean Wagner out.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:31.440]  Pugoshin was told, the gambit's up, nobody's rallying to your cause, you're going to die.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:33.440]  Avoid bloodshed.
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.440]  We will allow you to withdraw.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:37.440]  We won't arrest you, but you're done.
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.440]  You're going into permanent exile in Belarus.
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:43.440]  Wagner will be dismantled.
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:48.440]  The people who supported you, we won't prosecute, but they're not going to be able to serve.
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:52.440]  The people that didn't, and remember, the vast majority of Wagner did not support this.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:56.440]  They were in their barracks, or they were misled into participating,
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:00.440]  thinking that they were actually securing the border from Ukrainian attack.
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:01.440]  They will be allowed to serve.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.440]  This is all genius. You've got to come back on tomorrow.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.440]  Hold on, you've got to come back.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.440]  Incredible analysis, the best analysis out there,
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:12.440]  but big picture for folks who aren't a former head weapons inspector like you.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:15.440]  What does this mean? What does the West do?
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:18.440]  Because they were all hyping it and saying, oh, we're going to take the sanctions off Wagner,
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:21.440]  and now they're not, and the West was celebrating it.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.440]  Now they're deflated.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.440]  Big picture. Talk to me like I'm five years old.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.440]  When it comes to these subjects, you're smarter than me on this.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:31.440]  What does this signify? Does this strengthen Putin, weaken him?
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:36.440]  I mean, because this comes on the heels of the Ukrainian offensive being smashed.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.440]  That's confirmed.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.440]  They admit that.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:42.440]  Even CNN says a week ago, Ukrainian offensive smashed, Putin winning,
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.440]  and now we're told this weird fizzle coup that a bunch of tanks
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.440]  started driving up a road and stopped.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.440]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:58.440]  Look, NATO is assembling next month on the 11th for a summit.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.440]  This was supposed to be their miracle.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.440]  This was something that the intelligence services of the United States
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:08.440]  and Great Britain had been planning for weeks, if not months.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.440]  This was the Hail Mary.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.440]  This was the Hail Mary, and it fizzled, it thumped.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:18.440]  Putin is stronger. There were no defections.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:21.440]  The Russian Army is on the front lines.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:23.440]  The Ukrainians have resumed their attacks.
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:25.440]  They're being slaughtered on the front lines.
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:27.440]  NATO has no plan B.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:29.440]  So this is a disaster for NATO.
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:31.440]  This makes Putin stronger.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.440]  But, again, I just want to point out that this was very embarrassing for him
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.440]  because it made him look like a banana republic.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.440]  No, I agree. I said that first hour.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:43.440]  I said, is this a defeat for Putin when he said he would prosecute Purgosian,
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.440]  now let him go to Belarus, or does this make Putin stronger?
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:49.440]  I want this war to end. I'm an American, just like you.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.440]  Like you said, you're a Marine.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.440]  If we get a war with Russia, you're going to win.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:53.440]  But they're not attacking us.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.440]  There's Chinese spies that own Hollywood.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:57.440]  We're being infiltrated by the globalists.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:00.440]  It's Target trying to teach sex to my kids.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.440]  If Putin did that, he'd be my enemy.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.440]  And I just want to be friends with Russia.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:05.440]  I don't want to de-escalate this.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.440]  So where do you see this going, Scott Ritter?
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:11.440]  Because you're probably the smartest guy in the room when it comes to this.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:14.440]  Look, I continue to believe that Russia will achieve a strategic victory
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:18.440]  over the Ukrainian military by the end of this summer, early fall.
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:21.440]  The Ukrainians cannot continue to sustain the casualties that they're
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.440]  currently suffering on the battlefield, and there's nothing in the pipeline
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.440]  to replace the equipment and the manpower that they're losing.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:35.440]  But then, you know, how Russia resolves this politically is yet to be announced.
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:39.440]  The suggestion is that Russia will destroy the Ukrainian army,
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:41.440]  seize control of the Russian territories,
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:44.440]  and then push the Ukrainian army back another 100,
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:47.440]  150 kilometers to keep them out of range of Russian territories.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:50.440]  But then the question is, then what?
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.440]  And I don't have an answer for that because the Russian government
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:56.440]  isn't showing its cards, nor should it.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.440]  I mean, they don't work for Scott Ritter.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.440]  They don't work for Alex Jones.
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:03.440]  And so they're keeping their cards closely held.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:07.440]  I do believe that Russia is interested in a negotiated settlement,
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.440]  that they would be reasonable to an extent,
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.440]  meaning they're not going to give up Russian territory,
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:14.440]  they're not going to give up their security,
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.440]  but they're not going to demand, you know, the end of Ukraine.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.440]  They would ask Ukraine not to be part of NATO.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.440]  They just don't want Ukraine joining NATO.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:26.440]  Remember, Scott, just a year ago it was a conspiracy theory
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:29.440]  that NATO wanted them to join NATO-Ukraine.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.440]  Now they admit they want to join Ukraine.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:35.440]  The one Russian thing they said, the West didn't deal from a position of reality.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.440]  They said, oh, we don't want Ukraine.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.440]  Now they say, no, we want to fast-track Ukraine.
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  Fast-track Ukraine.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.440]  Again, this is insanity.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:48.440]  You know, the strategy, the stated objective of the United States
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.440]  is the strategic defeat of Russia.
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:53.440]  Russia has said that if they suffer a strategic defeat,
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.440]  that's an existential threat to their survival,
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:58.440]  and they can use nuclear weapons in response.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:01.440]  So our policy of seeking to defeat Russia strategically,
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:03.440]  even though we're going to fail, people need to understand…
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:06.440]  Is to push Russia into a nuclear war.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:07.440]  We'd be dying.
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:10.440]  That's exactly what our policy is, and it's insane.
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:13.020]  Pastor, you're hearing a lot of great points.
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:15.020]  What do you make of this point in time in history?
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.020]  No, I think it's an exciting time.
[01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:20.020]  I think it's what we've been talking about, what the Bible predicts.
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:23.020]  I think this is the greatest hour to be alive.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:28.020]  I mean, I would rather live now than any other time in history.
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:32.020]  I think we were handpicked to be here.
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:33.020]  I agree.
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.020]  People say life is boring.
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:37.020]  Scott Ritter, this is not a boring time to be alive, is it?
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:43.020]  We've been struck by that old Chinese curse, may you live in interesting times.
[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:45.020]  These are about the most interesting times there are.
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:49.020]  Quick answer, please join us again soon.
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:53.020]  You're an amazing researcher and brain, real Scott Ritter on Twitter,
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:58.020]  ScottRitterExpert.com, and people can find your book and more at ScottRitterExpert.com.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:01.020]  What do you think the West is really thinking?
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:03.020]  Because I saw the hype, defeat of Putin, embarrassment.
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:04.020]  I play devil's advocate.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:06.020]  I can see it makes him look weak at one level.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:12.020]  But at the end of the day, he just defeated their main gambit, their desperate Hail Mary.
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:14.020]  What is the West really thinking right now?
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:17.020]  Because they just slaughtered the Ukrainian offensive.
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.020]  No, the West is desperate.
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:23.020]  The bottom line is that the West is going to abandon Ukraine
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:26.020]  because it's unsustainable to keep with Ukraine.
[01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:29.020]  And then they're going to try and get the best deal they can from Putin
[01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:34.020]  in terms of trying to secure some sort of new European security framework.
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:36.020]  They failed all over.
[01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:40.020]  The effort to destroy the Russian economy through sanctions has failed.
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:42.020]  The Russian economy is stronger today than it has ever been.
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:44.020]  They failed militarily.
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:46.020]  And they're failing politically.
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:47.020]  NATO is fractured.
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:49.020]  The European Union is fractured.
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:54.020]  So I think you're going to see increasing desperation on the part of Europe
[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:58.020]  to find a peaceful off-ramp off this conflict at the United States.
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:00.020]  Yeah, they've blown up pipelines.
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:04.020]  They've run coups against nuclear power.
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:06.020]  What else can they do?
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:09.020]  I mean, I don't ever underestimate the new world order.
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:12.020]  These globalists are crazy because they're never held to account
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:14.020]  because they hide behind the policymakers.
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.020]  Putin's actually out there.
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:17.020]  The buck stops with him.
[01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:19.020]  Love him or hate him, at least it stops with him.
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:21.020]  The globalists get to hide.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:23.020]  But, I mean, what else will they pull then?
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:25.020]  Because what can they do, Scott?
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:27.020]  And I'm going to let you go in a minute.
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:30.020]  The next thing on the agenda will be some sort of attack
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:35.020]  on the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant to try and create the fear
[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:41.020]  of a Three Mile Island, Chernobyl-type nuclear catastrophe.
[01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:44.020]  I agree, a false flag, a nuclear false flag.
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.020]  Yeah.
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:47.020]  Well, stop it.
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.020]  In your own words, interrupt it.
[01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:51.020]  Your warning of a nuclear false flag.
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:55.020]  I'm warning that Ukraine is going to attack the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:54:00.020]  to create a nuclear crisis that they will then use to try and get
[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:05.020]  a United Nations peacekeeping force to take control of that facility,
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:09.020]  and this will bring about a cessation on the front.
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:10.020]  Russia will never go for it.
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:12.020]  Russia's ahead of the game on this.
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:18.020]  Look, if we haven't learned one thing, Russia's smarter than Europe,
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:19.020]  and they're smarter than the United States.
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.020]  They're five steps ahead.
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.020]  This Purgosian thing was an embarrassment.
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:27.020]  I think it's one of the few times that Putin has gotten off on the bad foot,
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:29.020]  but they've quickly recovered.
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:32.020]  And I think Russia has a game plan.
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:34.020]  They're executing it, and the West is playing catch-up,
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:36.020]  and they're running out of time.
[01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:39.020]  They're not going to be able to catch up.
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:42.020]  Well, I just hope we can do business with Russia and have organic farms
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:46.020]  and business and oil and move forward and not blow each other up.
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:48.020]  Scott Ritter, incredible information.
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:49.020]  Real Scott Ritter on Twitter.
[01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:52.020]  Tell folks briefly about your book.
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:56.020]  Well, the book is Disarmament in the Time of Perestroika,
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:58.020]  Disarmament or Arms Control on the End of the Soviet Union.
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:01.020]  It's about the implementation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty,
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:05.020]  the first ever nuclear reduction treaty.
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:09.020]  It also was the first time we used inspectors on the ground, on soil.
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:13.020]  So I was one of the first inspectors working in the Soviet Union.
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:15.020]  You know, the 1980s were a very dangerous time.
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:18.020]  We came close to nuclear conflict several times.
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:23.020]  Today people say, how do we get off this relationship, this bad relationship?
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:25.020]  How do we solve this problem?
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:28.020]  And I say read the book because it's a template of hope.
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:31.020]  We did it once before through the vehicle of arms control,
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:35.020]  and we could do it again if we just make arms control our top policy.
[01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:38.020]  Instead of trying to seek the strategic defeat of Russia,
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:43.020]  we should be seeking strategic cooperation to reduce the threat of nuclear war.
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:47.020]  And I believe that would be the best policy possible.
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:48.020]  Scott, glad you're back.
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:49.020]  Very dangerous trip, I know.
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:50.020]  Thank you so much.
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:51.020]  Talk to you soon.
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:52.020]  Okay.
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:53.020]  Thank you.
[01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:55.020]  Pastor, we got a minute and a half before we go to break,
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:56.020]  and we're going to come back.
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:55:58.020]  Owen's going to take over about 10, 15 minutes,
[01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:00.020]  and we're going to do an over two-hour live program here.
[01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:02.020]  Yeah, we have to go live in there right now.
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:03.020]  No, no.
[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:04.020]  We're about to leave.
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:05.020]  Okay.
[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:06.020]  So Owen Troyer on my feed is about to do a few minutes,
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:07.020]  and he'll grab your feed.
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:09.020]  Your feed's at Revival.com.
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:10.020]  Everybody can find it right there.
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:12.020]  Or RevivalTV.com.
[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:13.020]  RevivalTV.com.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:14.020]  Yeah.
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:15.020]  And we're on our YouTube channel,
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:17.020]  Rodney Ambrow on YouTube or Rodney and Donna Ambrow on Facebook
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:19.020]  until I finish the offering,
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:21.020]  and then you and I do things that will go with those two,
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:23.020]  but we'll be on RevivalTV.com.
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:25.020]  We're going to break in one minute.
[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:28.020]  Say a 60-second prayer, hopefully for peace.
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:31.020]  Father, I pray for each and every person watching.
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:34.020]  Many are concerned about tomorrow, what's going to take place.
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:37.020]  But, Father, we know that if they have given their life to you,
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.020]  that there can be a peace.
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:41.020]  And I pray even now, those that are watching,
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:42.020]  just pray this after me.
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:45.020]  Say, Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:47.020]  Forgive me of my sin.
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:48.020]  Wash me in your blood.
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:51.020]  And I confess you as my Lord and my Savior.
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:55.020]  And from this night, I give my life to you, and I will serve you.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:58.020]  Now, Father, I pray for each person that prayed that prayer,
[01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:00.020]  that you'll lead them, you'll guide them by your Spirit,
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:01.020]  you'll protect them.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:03.020]  It doesn't matter what's taking place in the world
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:06.020]  because your people, your hand is upon your people,
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:09.020]  and I thank you for supernatural protection upon your people
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:11.020]  as they serve you and obey you.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:13.020]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:14.020]  Beautiful.
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:16.020]  I did not plug any in the last two hours.
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:17.020]  That's my fault.
