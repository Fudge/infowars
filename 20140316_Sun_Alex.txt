[00:00.000 --> 00:17.720]  We are on the march the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[00:17.720 --> 00:45.000]  Well here we are live the 16th day already of March 2014 I am your host Alex Jones
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.240]  will be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[00:51.240 --> 00:56.280]  obviously the Malaysian story is one of the biggest stories in the world right
[00:56.280 --> 01:00.840]  now but I think it's a diversion quite frankly from the Russia situation there's
[01:00.840 --> 01:05.920]  no thinking about it the rest situation has is accelerating towards massive
[01:05.920 --> 01:12.520]  crises we'll be breaking that down as our top story today but the Malaysian
[01:12.520 --> 01:15.920]  government and their head military official is saying it's conclusive
[01:15.920 --> 01:20.800]  someone hijacked the aircraft and now they are shifting attention to the
[01:20.800 --> 01:25.200]  pilot who was seen wearing anti government t-shirts in the past anti
[01:25.200 --> 01:32.000]  Malaysian government t-shirts saying democracy is dead and that he reportedly
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.080]  after the transponders returned off on the plane made a radio comment and was
[01:36.080 --> 01:39.680]  the last person heard before the plane disappeared under the radar and they're
[01:39.680 --> 01:45.120]  reporting that his family moved out and disappeared the day before the
[01:45.120 --> 01:49.480]  disappearance that's red linked up on drugs report calm deliberate action
[01:49.480 --> 01:56.000]  focus shifts to passengers crew as new clues emerge quote conclusive someone
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.320]  hijacked jet may have sent signals on ground pilot wife and children moved
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.520]  out day before disappearance can a plane really vanish will you have the pilots
[02:05.520 --> 02:12.480]  hijacking it and more so that's going on that front and and we'll talk about it
[02:12.480 --> 02:15.840]  some of the day but quite frankly it is not important compared to what's
[02:15.840 --> 02:19.840]  happening domestically to our liberties and the situation with Russia that the
[02:19.840 --> 02:26.640]  new polls show Vladimir Putin is nearing 85% approval ratings he was at 60
[02:26.640 --> 02:30.600]  something just a few months ago because of the Crimea Ukraine situation the
[02:30.600 --> 02:35.240]  globalist are just handing him an absolute bonanza right now but they're
[02:35.240 --> 02:38.760]  handing themselves a political bonanza for the EU and Obama and the globalist
[02:38.760 --> 02:44.240]  out of the big war that is brewing over there US Navy destroyer to continue more
[02:44.240 --> 02:50.440]  black sea drills off the coast of Crimea Russia says they electronically shot down
[02:50.440 --> 02:54.960]  a drone a US predator drone and they've got the tail number
[02:54.960 --> 03:00.440]  Crimeans are choosing to join Russia in vote exit polls show with the polls now
[03:00.440 --> 03:07.880]  closing over there looks like it's 90 to 10% to join Russia used to be part of
[03:07.880 --> 03:13.840]  Russia that's why and of course there's a story out of our team where our team
[03:13.840 --> 03:18.440]  points out five referendums the West has not taken issue with and we're going to
[03:18.440 --> 03:22.640]  be looking at some of those referendums and I'm not defending what Russia is
[03:22.640 --> 03:29.200]  doing here Putin is ruling more and more with an iron fist certainly Russia has
[03:29.200 --> 03:39.040]  exploited Ukraine over the last 200 years but ladies and gentlemen NATO is far
[03:39.040 --> 03:42.880]  more sophisticated far more evil and wants to suck that country dry and ways
[03:42.880 --> 03:50.120]  Russia never has financially and NATO George Soros and the EU absolutely
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.240]  started this whole thing a few months ago when they voted to not join the EU and
[03:54.240 --> 04:00.600]  are forcing this situation and poking the Russians and so you have to say it's
[04:00.600 --> 04:06.080]  wrong and that's why Ron Paul who's an informed person and reads no exaggeration
[04:06.080 --> 04:09.920]  hundreds of news articles a day Ron Paul's on next week and every time I
[04:09.920 --> 04:13.280]  throw some wild card breaking story at him he knows about it or some obscure
[04:13.280 --> 04:19.680]  bill or some factoid or history piece he knows it Ron Paul's uber smart uber
[04:19.680 --> 04:27.000]  well-read uber bookworm hyper intelligent for 77 years old I mean he's
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.080]  the real deal the kind of doctor who half the time going into Ron Paul love
[04:33.080 --> 04:37.640]  fest would do half of his medical care free at the charity hospital we're
[04:37.640 --> 04:43.400]  talking saint-like creature and he says the West is in the wrong rushes in the
[04:43.400 --> 04:46.960]  right in the great balance he said Putin's no angel but the West is
[04:46.960 --> 04:50.800]  starting us and it's very bad that's because he knows the facts I mean you
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.840]  know the facts you know this is wrong real simple and it lets Putin become a
[04:55.840 --> 05:01.560]  dictator as well we'll be right back in the last 50 years iodine has been phased

[09:42.960 --> 09:47.120]  hours and you just heard that intro there just a few examples of how our
[09:47.120 --> 09:52.720]  country is being converted into an authoritarian state so that special
[09:52.720 --> 09:57.120]  interest can basically subdivide our economy shut down the free market and
[09:57.120 --> 10:03.080]  bring in a form of crony capitalism that suppresses any form of true
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.560]  independence or free markets we're going to talk about the missing Malaysian
[10:07.560 --> 10:11.280]  airliner and they're now saying I think it may be the pilots and there's evidence
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.760]  to that effect where the family moved out the day before and disappeared and
[10:15.760 --> 10:19.040]  they're saying he was an anti-government person who didn't like the Malaysian
[10:19.040 --> 10:22.720]  government the government's now saying they believe it's a deliberate action
[10:22.720 --> 10:31.600]  focus ships to passengers crew as new clues emerge the head of the Malaysian
[10:31.600 --> 10:35.920]  military is saying that it's conclusive someone hijacked the jet may have sent
[10:35.920 --> 10:39.320]  signal on the ground pilots wife and children moved out day before
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.920]  disappearance and that's what I said day one looks like a hijacking but with
[10:43.920 --> 10:48.200]  governments involved you never know who really hijacked it but that that mystery
[10:48.200 --> 10:55.480]  continues to deepen now here is the real top stories coming up today that for
[10:55.480 --> 11:02.800]  me I think are most important and really matter
[11:02.800 --> 11:10.720]  and that is the situation in the Ukraine that we're gonna be breaking down in
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.840]  detail first and then even bigger news when it comes to free speech in the
[11:14.840 --> 11:20.560]  architecture of the global system us to relinquish remaining control over the
[11:20.560 --> 11:26.240]  internet to the United Nations and private interest and this is out of the
[11:26.240 --> 11:34.880]  washings and posts and is an extremely extremely revealing story so we're
[11:34.880 --> 11:40.840]  going to be breaking all of that down coming up after we get into the
[11:40.840 --> 11:47.160]  situation in Russia and this is another headline of the daily caller ex-Bush
[11:47.160 --> 11:51.680]  administration official internet giveaway weakened cyber security opens
[11:51.680 --> 11:58.440]  doors to web attack that's just some of the news on that front we're going to
[11:58.440 --> 12:05.200]  be covering no it opens the door to web taxes yes that's true but more
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.160]  importantly to international control of free speech and censorship of it which
[12:10.160 --> 12:16.000]  the UN heartily supports we're gonna get to that coming up in the next segment
[12:16.000 --> 12:24.000]  first off US Navy destroyer to conduct more black sea drills commander says
[12:24.000 --> 12:30.400]  that's out of AFP here's another one out of AFP Russia says it intercepted US
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.680]  drone over Crimea shot it down with electronic means bringing down the
[12:34.680 --> 12:38.480]  predator drone they have the tail number they said they brought it down from 12
[12:38.480 --> 12:48.240]  thousand feet and again they give out the tail number of the UAV QMQ 5 B of the
[12:48.240 --> 12:53.760]  66th American reconnaissance brigade based in Braveria so things are
[12:53.760 --> 12:57.680]  certainly escalating very very quickly here's another one Bloomberg reports

[13:46.920 --> 13:51.400]  world war one all over again and I agree with his historical parallels we've had
[13:51.400 --> 13:54.960]  top political scientists and professors on months ago saying that's the
[13:54.960 --> 13:59.600]  parallels of what's happened with Russia Russian jets and RAF face off that's the

[14:47.240 --> 14:50.560]  is not the US government this is the globalist that have hijacked the US that
[14:50.560 --> 14:55.040]  want a giant new war a new political distraction from the derivatives and the
[14:55.040 --> 15:00.600]  bid-rigging and the scams and the total takeover of society. Russia has now

[20:40.880 --> 20:44.040]  on internet freedom coming up in the next segment it's massive here's the
[20:44.040 --> 20:48.760]  Washington Post headline US to relinquish remaining control over the
[20:48.760 --> 20:53.080]  internet and the article goes on to say they don't know who's gonna be given
[20:53.080 --> 20:59.160]  control of it that's not actually true it's very public who's going to be given
[20:59.160 --> 21:04.880]  control over it and so we're going to be breaking that down and giving you the
[21:04.880 --> 21:08.040]  rest of the story then I'm going to open the phones up to the balance of the
[21:08.040 --> 21:11.760]  transmission to get your take on that issue but more importantly the Ukraine
[21:11.760 --> 21:18.040]  situation again everybody thinks of it Coke Pepsi Ford Chevy somebody's good
[21:18.040 --> 21:23.360]  somebody's bad pick a side the Russians are non-angels Vladimir Putin is not an
[21:23.360 --> 21:27.880]  angel he's an authoritarian but Russia has been reforming and free market
[21:27.880 --> 21:31.800]  areas and is becoming more free economically according to major
[21:31.800 --> 21:35.200]  university studies in the United States in many respects they're going the
[21:35.200 --> 21:39.360]  opposite direction compared to the United States when it comes to economic and
[21:39.360 --> 21:43.280]  other reforms the United States is becoming authoritarian pull up
[21:43.280 --> 21:47.800]  university studies find us you know less free in the press than other nations
[21:47.800 --> 21:55.520]  us less free in so many examples as our index of freedom goes down economic
[21:55.520 --> 22:00.640]  freedom mobility freedom freedom of the press the United States is becoming
[22:00.640 --> 22:06.080]  less and less free going after the whistleblowers the examples are legion
[22:06.080 --> 22:12.680]  so when we say the Ukraine situation is a very nasty operation by NATO by the
[22:12.680 --> 22:16.760]  EU and by the globalists that run our country it's not an endorsement of
[22:16.760 --> 22:21.640]  Vladimir Putin or the Russians but Crimea is on their border it's been part of
[22:21.640 --> 22:26.600]  Russia off and on for hundreds of years it's they just had a referendum exit
[22:26.600 --> 22:31.520]  polls 93% Bloomberg reports are voting to join Russia and why is that because
[22:31.520 --> 22:37.920]  they're scared three weeks ago NATO EU backed groups over through the elected
[22:37.920 --> 22:43.200]  government they're in Kiev right in the middle of the country and are now very
[22:43.200 --> 22:48.480]  anti-Russian and anti-Slav that make up about 60% of the country's Slavic one
[22:48.480 --> 22:52.560]  way or the other and you know a good 20% or so or Russian and they're mainly in
[22:52.560 --> 22:57.960]  the east places like Ukraine where it's 75% Russian but but even though it's
[22:57.960 --> 23:04.280]  75% Russian 93% have voted to join Russia because they think that's better
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.960]  than being under the EU who they've seen suck dry all these different countries
[23:08.960 --> 23:13.680]  and signed them on to EU debts I mean joining the EU is like joining the be
[23:13.680 --> 23:19.280]  given brain cancer so the issue is NATO in the West have started this fight and
[23:19.280 --> 23:26.560]  they are trying to overthrow the entire region not just Ukraine and push their
[23:26.560 --> 23:31.400]  forces and missiles and weapons systems up to the Russian border via NATO and
[23:31.400 --> 23:36.560]  this is actually forcing Russia into a new Cold War stance and they have
[23:36.560 --> 23:41.120]  massed 200,000 Russian troops on the Russian border with Ukraine they are
[23:41.120 --> 23:45.440]  pouring in according to Reuters right now with attack helicopters tanks armored
[23:45.440 --> 23:50.600]  vehicles hundreds of thousands of troops nuclear mobile missiles you name it as
[23:50.600 --> 23:57.560]  NATO pours ships F-16s and you name it into the area and I just read some of
[23:57.560 --> 24:04.280]  those headlines earlier as as NATO brings in the RAF the German aircraft the
[24:04.280 --> 24:11.320]  British aircraft I mean this is a major major major buildup of troops on both
[24:11.320 --> 24:14.920]  sides it's how World War one and World War two started very very similarly and
[24:14.920 --> 24:20.720]  most historians and academics are freaking out right now now I know Justin
[24:20.720 --> 24:27.120]  Timberlake or Justin Bieber or Jay-Z or Cayenne Pepper West or whatever 50 cent
[24:27.120 --> 24:33.440]  I know all that's real important right now for everybody but or even how you
[24:33.440 --> 24:36.560]  know wonderful Obama is and and and he's gonna give us some free health care
[24:36.560 --> 24:40.800]  even though it doubles and triples your prices but for anybody out there who
[24:40.800 --> 24:44.360]  doesn't understand how serious this is this is this has got me more concerned
[24:44.360 --> 24:48.960]  than I've ever been in my life because it shows the recklessness of the
[24:48.960 --> 24:58.760]  globalist it shows the craziness and I look at John Corzine who headed up
[24:58.760 --> 25:01.760]  Goldman Sachs that basically is one of the most powerful investment banks in the
[25:01.760 --> 25:06.440]  world that sets most of the NATO policy and US policy gives more money than any
[25:06.440 --> 25:10.680]  other group they're supporting this and John Corzine the governor of the New
[25:10.680 --> 25:14.200]  Jersey former governor for Chris Christie you know just a few years ago he
[25:14.200 --> 25:17.080]  did the MF globals the thing where he took millions of dollars of people's
[25:17.080 --> 25:20.960]  private bank accounts and never got in trouble because he made 40 to 1 bets
[25:20.960 --> 25:26.720]  with their bank accounts their brokerage gold accounts and you go what does that
[25:26.720 --> 25:31.960]  do with with NATO and with Ukraine it shows the craziness of the people running
[25:31.960 --> 25:38.280]  things it shows that they've lost touch with reality the Federal Reserve the
[25:38.280 --> 25:43.400]  private Federal Reserve has created over 1.5 quadrillion in fake derivative
[25:43.400 --> 25:47.920]  crap and they've signed the entire Western world over to it and now they're
[25:47.920 --> 25:51.760]  expanding a planetary corporate world government with carbon taxes they fund
[25:51.760 --> 25:56.240]  anti-family initiatives they fund common core two plus two equals five they
[25:56.240 --> 25:59.840]  fund anti-gun initiatives the World Bank is just the international arm of the
[25:59.840 --> 26:04.280]  Federal Reserve it basically financed South by Southwest and had dozens of
[26:04.280 --> 26:09.600]  anti-gun events added and anti-free speech events sponsored it I mean these
[26:09.600 --> 26:17.040]  are flaming authoritarians who now have the US the EU NATO on a collision
[26:17.040 --> 26:22.040]  course with George Soros of course involved as usual the former Nazi
[26:22.040 --> 26:26.360]  collaborator George Soros helping finance the overthrow of Ukraine to then roll
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.280]  weapons up against the Russians you've got the chairman of the joint chiefs on
[26:30.280 --> 26:33.640]  Friday Dempsey general Dempsey sent a prepared for military action under
[26:33.640 --> 26:39.320]  orders they're ready to take on Russia Kerry says on Friday back out of Crimea
[26:39.320 --> 26:44.360]  or there will be military and or sanctions increased on Monday that's
[26:44.360 --> 26:46.960]  your deadline
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.960]  Soros says Ukraine needs to be taken over by the EU period that's CNN I mean
[26:52.960 --> 26:59.920]  this is the Ukraine being taken over by the EU a la the Nazis World War two and
[26:59.920 --> 27:06.600]  then the Russians a la Stalin World War two taking the other half of Ukraine
[27:06.840 --> 27:11.080]  which is basically what happened later but but Poland's the great example of
[27:11.080 --> 27:17.240]  this Poland was divided by the Nazis who were the EU this time and then you've
[27:17.240 --> 27:21.160]  got the Russians coming into Poland taking the other half when the Russians
[27:21.160 --> 27:24.360]  and the Nazis were actually on the same side early on in World War one before
[27:24.360 --> 27:29.080]  Hitler double crossed them with Operation Barbarossa so this is all
[27:29.080 --> 27:34.200]  being repeated again and the Russians by the way have not blinked the Russians
[27:34.200 --> 27:37.560]  are putting hundreds of thousands of troops into Crimea right now and are
[27:37.560 --> 27:41.080]  not going to back off on the deadline just like in 2008 in south of the city
[27:41.080 --> 27:45.280]  in Eucasia both areas in northern Georgia that were Russian held the
[27:45.280 --> 27:50.040]  Georgians back by NATO attack Russian military bases killing everyone at the
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.760]  bases basically troop police bases with a few hundred troops on each base they
[27:54.760 --> 27:59.240]  soon overwhelming force with the tanks and artillery and killed them in their
[27:59.240 --> 28:03.240]  barracks at point length range so the Russians then poured in with hundreds of
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.080]  thousands of troops and mobile medium-range nuke launchers and said
[28:07.080 --> 28:10.320]  we've targeted Europe back off their chairman of the Joint Chief said in a
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.920]  press conference or we will fire weapons in the next hour NATO backed off this was
[28:14.920 --> 28:20.320]  on Russian TV folks we're preparing to nuke NATO bases in Europe if you don't
[28:20.320 --> 28:23.880]  back off and the NATO backed off this is the type of stuff we're talking about
[28:23.880 --> 28:28.320]  why did NATO do that why are they probing Russia why are they starting
[28:28.320 --> 28:32.440]  this why are they doing this and people say well what are you for Putin no but
[28:32.440 --> 28:35.720]  the West overthrew the Ukrainian government and is trying to absorb
[28:35.720 --> 28:39.160]  Ukraine right now and I get the Ukrainians got persecuted by the Russians
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.680]  before World War two I know all about the Ukrainian
[28:42.680 --> 28:46.560]  Sarvation I've been against it I'm against communist but this is not what's
[28:46.560 --> 28:50.360]  happening now this could start World War three we'll break down the rest of it

[32:10.480 --> 32:13.720]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans
[32:13.720 --> 32:18.160]  willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by

[34:13.560 --> 34:16.800]  give the phone number out now before I get into the internet takeover by the
[34:16.800 --> 34:21.480]  UN so in the next segment we can start open the phones up now quite frankly
[34:21.480 --> 34:26.200]  most people worldwide don't don't study geopolitics but Americans and
[34:26.200 --> 34:29.920]  international studies you can look this up have the lowest level of passports of
[34:29.920 --> 34:34.760]  any major country most countries people have 60 70% passports Americans it's
[34:34.760 --> 34:39.840]  35% last time I checked have a passport most Americans cannot even name their
[34:39.840 --> 34:44.480]  neighboring states capital or even their capital in many cases most high school
[34:44.480 --> 34:51.000]  graduates cannot name any of the founding fathers I mean you see those
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.320]  university studies every year were you know one-fifth of Americans think the
[34:55.320 --> 34:58.920]  earth is the center of the universe stuff like that so I'm not putting down
[34:58.920 --> 35:02.360]  my fellow Americans it's just we kind of live in a bubble our own culture our
[35:02.360 --> 35:05.920]  culture has been dominant for a long time because the world saw it as
[35:05.920 --> 35:12.360]  superior they admired the 1776 culture now we've replaced that culture with a
[35:12.360 --> 35:19.240]  Hollywood culture which the world now sees as toxic because it is but every
[35:19.240 --> 35:23.120]  few weeks I like to open the phones up for veterans or active-duty military
[35:23.120 --> 35:27.320]  because the mainstream media likes to say the military is full of idiots they
[35:27.320 --> 35:33.680]  like to say military intelligence is an oxymoron they like to say that you know
[35:33.680 --> 35:38.000]  the military are fools and things like that and undoubtedly recruiters do go
[35:38.000 --> 35:43.200]  out sometimes to get infantry troops from farms and places and foster homes
[35:43.200 --> 35:47.760]  where folks might not have the highest IQs or had the best opportunities but I
[35:47.760 --> 35:55.560]  will tell you that hands down unequivocally no if-hands-or-bots the
[35:55.560 --> 35:59.240]  number one group that's the most informed geopolitically the most informed
[35:59.240 --> 36:04.920]  about the way things work the most savvy about liberty and the people that
[36:04.920 --> 36:09.120]  will come that if you're at 3 a.m. if you need your tire changing you can and
[36:09.120 --> 36:13.120]  don't have a spare or if you need somebody to come help you move houses or
[36:13.120 --> 36:17.480]  you need somebody to you know come to your aid or whatever or you need somebody
[36:17.480 --> 36:19.960]  you can give a hundred thousand dollars to and get it back from them in ten
[36:19.960 --> 36:23.600]  years and you know it's all gonna be there it's it would be a military
[36:23.600 --> 36:27.520]  veteran and that's why I discriminate against the audience a lot even though
[36:27.520 --> 36:30.720]  I'm not a military veteran and say I'm opening the phones up today I do this
[36:30.720 --> 36:34.160]  every few weeks for just veterans or active-duty because quite frankly I
[36:34.160 --> 36:38.360]  don't want to discuss Ukraine with the average American the average American
[36:38.360 --> 36:42.600]  doesn't even know where it is the average American doesn't even care I open the
[36:42.600 --> 36:45.600]  phones up for veterans and active duty they'll know all about it they'll know
[36:45.600 --> 36:48.520]  about the bases they'll know about the pipelines they'll know about what planes
[36:48.520 --> 36:51.840]  got shipped over there they'll know about what Putin's doing because they're
[36:51.840 --> 36:55.760]  informed they're into that they're not watching football all day they are
[36:55.760 --> 36:59.040]  actually studying geopolitics because they're into it because they've been all
[36:59.040 --> 37:03.280]  over the world that's why I want to get their take coming up in the next
[37:03.280 --> 37:08.440]  segment on this situation do you disagree with what I've said in the last
[37:08.440 --> 37:16.080]  segment what do you think of the f-16s the f-18s the f-15s the AWACS and the
[37:16.080 --> 37:20.920]  NATO special forces massing all over Ukraine to back up with electronic
[37:20.920 --> 37:27.040]  warfare and other systems the one million man reserve army of the Ukrainians
[37:27.040 --> 37:34.520]  and the 200,000 Russians pouring in to the area that's now voted Reuters just
[37:34.520 --> 37:40.480]  reported up from 93 95% exit polls and they've got Western exit pollers there
[37:40.480 --> 37:46.040]  you know Fox News CNN they're getting 95% saying they have voted to join Mother
[37:46.040 --> 37:52.080]  Russia and Kerry said Friday ultimate them there will be military and or
[37:52.080 --> 37:57.720]  sanctions if you don't pull out of Ukraine pull out of that area in Ukraine
[37:57.720 --> 38:02.520]  formerly part of Ukraine Crimea before that formerly part of Russia 95% have
[38:02.520 --> 38:07.160]  now voted in exit polls up from 93 an hour ago and the Russians are not
[38:07.160 --> 38:12.360]  backing off they're pouring weapons in and NATO is pouring weapons in now the
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.280]  best-case scenario is now they just create a new demilitarized zone along
[38:16.280 --> 38:21.000]  the Crimean border and a new Cold War starts that's a best-case scenario here
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.600]  with US warships entering the area it's just really bad the bad scenarios run
[38:27.600 --> 38:31.240]  from bad to worse obviously and I'd like to talk to military about that I'm sure
[38:31.240 --> 38:35.320]  you know what the scenarios are and you can add an augment my deep civilian
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.640]  research of this from publications military publications and civilian
[38:39.640 --> 38:44.440]  publications but this has all the looks of something that is designed to
[38:44.440 --> 38:50.360]  actually go hot and they did this before in 2008 and blinked so maybe
[38:50.360 --> 38:55.360]  they're not gonna blink this time or or what is the goal here because the word
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.200]  is and this is what I said three weeks ago if they mass trips up against the
[38:59.200 --> 39:04.320]  Crimean Russian hell area the Russians are gonna pour in they're going to open
[39:04.320 --> 39:07.640]  fire just like in Georgia they're going to have a huge battle with the
[39:07.640 --> 39:12.760]  Ukrainians and all hell is going to break loose it'll be I would say 20 times
[39:12.760 --> 39:16.480]  worse than Georgia 20 times worse conservatively and they're going to
[39:16.480 --> 39:23.840]  push all the way to the river and Kiev and probably take Kiev and then break
[39:23.840 --> 39:28.600]  the country in two or they might stop and split that country in two or that
[39:28.600 --> 39:32.840]  that capital city in two just like they did with Germany at the end of World
[39:32.840 --> 39:37.600]  War two just like the Russians and the Nazis did with Poland during their one
[39:37.600 --> 39:42.760]  year deal before Hitler double-crossed the Russians I mean geopolitically folks
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.760]  this is how history goes humans do the same thing over and over again and this
[39:47.760 --> 39:52.360]  time though the Russians are gonna pour in heavy armor and attack helicopters
[39:52.360 --> 39:55.760]  and if NATO tries to assist the Russians will come out with a press
[39:55.760 --> 40:02.720]  conference and they will say we've rolled mobile nuke launchers in and we're
[40:02.720 --> 40:06.840]  going to start firing on NATO bases in one hour by the way that was not in the
[40:06.840 --> 40:11.080]  US news in 2008 when that happened when the Olympics started they always do it
[40:11.080 --> 40:14.120]  thinking the Russians will back off during the Olympics this was at the
[40:14.120 --> 40:16.680]  Olympics this time they host the Olympics they launched the overthrow of
[40:16.680 --> 40:21.240]  Ukraine during the Olympics I want your take on this because I mean quite
[40:21.240 --> 40:24.840]  frankly really if I was a selfish man I'd be going and grabbing my kids and
[40:24.840 --> 40:29.680]  going you know to via strategic relocation an area not targeted
[40:29.680 --> 40:32.440]  militarily by nuke strikes and it doesn't mean I think this is going to
[40:32.440 --> 40:36.360]  happen but it's kind of like we got ten cards in our hand we've got a shuffling
[40:36.360 --> 40:40.920]  in the dark and turn the light on and see which one we've got I mean this is
[40:40.920 --> 40:45.000]  literally Russian roulette right now in fact this whole segment should be called
[40:45.000 --> 40:51.680]  nuclear thermal nuclear Russian roulette because because that's what it is you
[40:51.680 --> 40:57.640]  got like ten rounds in the cylinder they got pistols like that by the way I got
[40:57.640 --> 41:01.520]  22 like that I wouldn't say it's one out of six that's it's about one out of ten
[41:01.520 --> 41:04.600]  and I'm trying to be conservative here it might be two out of ten folks this is
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.360]  so horrible and they're just rolling the chamber and every chamber's got a bullet
[41:08.360 --> 41:13.040]  in it it just is it divide the country in half to does NATO back off and just I
[41:13.040 --> 41:19.720]  mean NATO just took all of Ukraine for the euro I mean they just took all the
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.320]  country so the Russians came in and got their military ports military bases and
[41:23.320 --> 41:27.080]  gas pipelines they own that they supply Europe with Russia took a tiny part of
[41:27.080 --> 41:33.600]  the country like six seven percent NATO just took 93% and they're going how dare
[41:33.600 --> 41:37.720]  you Russia now you know Putin's a bad guy and I get people calling me emails
[41:37.720 --> 41:41.560]  comments going Alex why are you a Rusky coming are you for Russia I'm not for
[41:41.560 --> 41:48.760]  Russia but but NATO is run by the globalist NATO's run by the EU George
[41:48.760 --> 41:52.360]  Soros is in their quarterbacking this whole thing with John Kerry for heaven's
[41:52.360 --> 41:56.520]  sakes Hillary Clinton's talking about military operations John McCain wants
[41:56.520 --> 42:03.120]  military strikes on Russian targets I got video I'm for war.com where this madman
[42:03.120 --> 42:09.400]  is over there stirring up the opposition six months ago to start this giving him
[42:09.400 --> 42:14.200]  billions of State Department money and now he's back on the news saying we need
[42:14.200 --> 42:20.640]  to back them up militarily this is horrible the Russians learned with their
[42:20.640 --> 42:25.240]  allies the Serbs when they gave the Muslims one-third of Serbia with the
[42:25.240 --> 42:31.040]  bombardment of DU of the nation that appeasing NATO only makes them invade
[42:31.040 --> 42:33.760]  more so I want to hear from military when we come back and then I'll get to the
[42:33.760 --> 42:38.120]  UN takeover of the internet later in the next hour this is too important let's

[48:50.560 --> 48:54.040]  eight nine two five three nine and then later in the next hour I'll get to the
[48:54.040 --> 49:00.160]  UN takeover the internet some huge news dealing with liberties here at home the
[49:00.160 --> 49:04.360]  second amendment there is a lot of it but this this Ukraine situation is the
[49:04.360 --> 49:10.120]  big deal here's John McCain yesterday the senator who just a few months ago was
[49:10.120 --> 49:13.960]  in Syria trying to get us to back al Qaeda there the military literally said
[49:13.960 --> 49:19.800]  no to Obama Benghazi was about arming al Qaeda and then they turned against the
[49:19.800 --> 49:23.800]  State Department and killed those people it's just outrageous and again it's not
[49:23.800 --> 49:27.240]  that the Russians are good it's that the people running our country and NATO are
[49:27.240 --> 49:32.200]  so bad and are starting this and and McCain is claiming Russia is invading
[49:32.200 --> 49:36.640]  Ukraine no the West has overthrown the government there the elected government
[49:36.640 --> 49:41.480]  and it's turning the country over to the EU and George Soros so Russia took its
[49:41.480 --> 49:44.800]  area that had been part of Russia for hundreds of years and they just had a
[49:44.800 --> 49:50.960]  referendum 95% voted to enter Russia so you're gonna attack Catalonia because
[49:50.960 --> 49:55.160]  they're leaving Spain you're gonna attack Scotland leaving the UK you're
[49:55.160 --> 49:59.760]  gonna attack all the referendums happening the West bath backs that
[49:59.760 --> 50:04.840]  mean this is crazy town because Obama's agenda is imploding the EU's agenda is
[50:04.840 --> 50:09.120]  imploding and I'm telling you folks they want a regional war maybe worse as a
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.480]  political distraction I'm telling you it's in the cards they've told the
[50:13.480 --> 50:17.560]  Russians tomorrow as an ultimatum we'll see who blanks we'll be here
[50:17.560 --> 50:23.800]  covering it on the weekday show I'm going to your phone calls momentarily but
[50:23.800 --> 50:28.840]  right now let's go to John McCain Ukraine is going to need a long-term
[50:28.840 --> 50:34.000]  military assistance program from the United States equipment both lethal and
[50:34.000 --> 50:41.400]  non-lethal I see that Ukraine has been invaded Russia is massing forces on the
[50:41.400 --> 50:46.240]  border provoking unrest threatening to annex part of this sovereign nation and
[50:46.240 --> 50:52.400]  possibly worse when free peoples and patriots victims of aggression wish to
[50:52.400 --> 50:56.560]  defend themselves and their homes from further aggression and when they ask for
[50:56.560 --> 51:01.240]  some modest means that they that can help them resist I believe we should
[51:01.240 --> 51:07.640]  provide it not to provide not to offer false hope or to harbored ourselves but
[51:07.640 --> 51:12.520]  simply it's the right and decent thing to do by the way they've had missile
[51:12.520 --> 51:18.040]  ships missile cruisers giant squadrons of NATO US British German French
[51:18.040 --> 51:22.840]  aircraft massing they're flying up against Russian aircraft every day just
[51:22.840 --> 51:27.960]  like the Cold War there's a huge NATO drill starting on the border with Russia
[51:27.960 --> 51:32.120]  I mean this is insane that this is absolutely trying to kick off a new
[51:32.120 --> 51:36.520]  Cold War and the Russians are becoming free market the average Russian loves
[51:36.520 --> 51:44.360]  the American people I mean this is this is wrong folks this is wrong Russia's
[51:44.360 --> 51:49.480]  paying people to have kids here they don't teach people as two equals five in
[51:49.480 --> 51:53.240]  Russia they teach that here under common core my point is this is not America
[51:53.240 --> 51:57.120]  versus the old communist this is the globalist using America to carry out
[51:57.120 --> 52:00.280]  something very evil and again we've got the phones loaded up people called other
[52:00.280 --> 52:03.360]  subjects hey let me just say it again we're talking to veterans are current
[52:03.360 --> 52:09.760]  military or people in Russia or Ukraine that's who we're talking to right now
[52:09.760 --> 52:18.080]  nobody else 877-789-2539 I want to hear from you Vincent in Montana says they're
[52:18.080 --> 52:23.440]  a veteran wants to give their take on Ukraine and what's your take Alex I'm
[52:23.440 --> 52:27.720]  gonna make this quick to let my brothers I have a chance to get into I think you're
[52:27.720 --> 52:31.920]  spot on in your assessment of the new Russia this is not the Soviet Union this
[52:31.920 --> 52:37.520]  is the new Russia which is more of a continuation of Tsarist Russia I think
[52:37.520 --> 52:41.080]  that they're orthodox highly orthodox and I think that they're a force for good
[52:41.080 --> 52:47.240]  in the world right now a 10% income tax rate promoting capitalism on their way
[52:47.240 --> 52:51.280]  up just like you said you know what's what's wrong with that but I think that
[52:51.280 --> 52:55.800]  this is not going to result in a hot war initially but it is going to result in a
[52:55.800 --> 53:01.280]  devastating economic war where perhaps they've got a financial collapse plan
[53:01.280 --> 53:04.120]  that they want to blame it on the Russians the Russians are going to
[53:04.120 --> 53:09.400]  retaliate and the biggest victim of this retaliation is going to be the German
[53:09.400 --> 53:15.640]  banks who stand to lose well maybe 750 billion dollars next week in Russian
[53:15.640 --> 53:20.120]  investment see how I asked veterans to call thank you I appreciate the call and
[53:20.120 --> 53:22.480]  he brought up all the points I meant to give you but didn't there's already
[53:22.480 --> 53:26.240]  sanctions on both sides Russians pulling tens of billions out the West
[53:26.240 --> 53:30.400]  pulling tens of billions out who gets hurt the people we need commerce we need
[53:30.400 --> 53:33.160]  to work with everybody who shares our values and you're right they're
[53:33.160 --> 53:36.760]  becoming very orthodox they suppress the orthodox church the Catholic church as
[53:36.760 --> 53:42.560]  well and Putin is a fan of sultan eason and they want to be the big tough bear
[53:42.560 --> 53:46.040]  and go free market again and then the globalists don't like that they don't
[53:46.040 --> 53:50.000]  want competition again they banned teaching five-year-olds how to wear
[53:50.000 --> 53:55.320]  dresses little boys over there our country promotes that you know we're in
[53:55.320 --> 53:58.560]  trouble when the Russians who got a lot of problems are better than us in many
[53:58.560 --> 54:05.240]  ways it's very sick very sick thank you Vincent great points I hope you're right
[54:05.240 --> 54:07.880]  because man I tell you they're pouring Russian troops in right now they're
[54:07.880 --> 54:12.480]  pouring NATO troops in right now Michael in Arkansas Navy veteran what's your

[55:24.520 --> 55:30.960]  Russian submarines off a ship sold a p3 sir p3c arrived no I understand what
[55:30.960 --> 55:34.000]  you're saying you were launching off a ship that had been sold by the Russians
[55:34.000 --> 55:44.440]  to the Icelanders here's the deal what's your bottom line on what's happening
[55:44.440 --> 55:57.920]  in the Ukraine yeah you know it's not going Soros is involved God bless you
[55:57.920 --> 56:01.880]  great points yeah again it's not that the Russians are good but NATO's starting
[56:01.880 --> 56:05.040]  this with George Soros and they're commanding it the guy that wants our
[56:05.040 --> 56:10.120]  guns I mean it's just it's crazy town it's crazy town let's go ahead and talk
[56:10.120 --> 56:13.720]  to Cecil and Arkansas veteran what's your take on what's happening in
[56:13.720 --> 56:18.560]  Ukraine oh just to go to show you Obama don't expect the rights of the people in
[56:18.560 --> 56:22.480]  the United States he damn sure don't expect or respect the rights of the
[56:22.480 --> 56:28.280]  people in over there I've got one thing that two things to add to that and his
[56:28.280 --> 56:34.400]  last batch of executive orders if he's supporting verb verbally or financially
[56:34.400 --> 56:39.800]  the people in the Crimea under under that executive order you will be considered
[56:39.800 --> 56:43.200]  a traitor in the United States you know I covered this last week when he signed
[56:43.200 --> 56:46.880]  it in Curtin Emma wrote an article about it on Friday so the romp wall and yeah
[56:46.880 --> 56:51.280]  the way the executive order is written it says if you don't support that the
[56:51.280 --> 56:55.840]  quote people Obama supports in Ukraine that they can take every dime you've got
[56:55.840 --> 56:58.600]  and of course that's mainly meaning Russian citizens and others that have
[56:58.600 --> 57:02.920]  money here in the US but it's so broadly written it is a dictatorial order great
[57:02.920 --> 57:06.040]  point glad you raised that I forgot to raise that point we're talking to
[57:06.040 --> 57:09.520]  veterans about their take on it because we have a lot of veterans that served in

[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.040]  were and we have no choice it's the globalist trying to conquer Ukraine
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.680]  trying to suck Spain dry trying to suck Iceland dry it's the globalist that
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:35.360]  have conquered America to a great extent now I want to finish it by taking our
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.320]  guns that's why I'm against what they're doing to Russia I get that the
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.480]  Russians abuse the Ukrainians under the Soviet I get that I was Ukraine was a
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.120]  sovereign country like Switzerland with a free market to hell with the Russians to
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.320]  hell with NATO and the EU don't you get that I know you get that but some of the
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:57.200]  folks out there they're like well we better be for this cuz you know I don't
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.000]  like George Soros but like Cliff Kincaid or whatever his name is you're
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.920]  claiming I'm a Russian agent and I guess Ron Paul's a Russian agent now too he
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.360]  was saying whatever his name is these Cliff Kincaid I've had him on the show
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.080]  before you know big neocon I saw it right in articles saying I'm you know a
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:19.920]  risky agent because I don't want to have you have this new cold war I mean if the
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.840]  Russians were doing something to me I'd be against them the communist Chinese
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.120]  government's lobbying domestically to take my guns and stuff and funding
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:33.480]  Hollywood now I'm against them I saw a few anti-gun stories on RT and I sort of
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.400]  call for their license to be jerked listen you mess with me you tread on me
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.920]  I come after you the Russians aren't doing Jack squat George Soros is trying
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.240]  to take my guns George Soros is trying to start a war with Russia the guy was a
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.920]  Nazi collaborator when he was 15 years old I'm sick of him both my
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.960]  grandfather's almost died the Army Air Corps one way or another I barely even
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.520]  exist because of the World War two in the Nazis and George Soros was working
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.320]  with him all my grandfathers were almost dying that piece of crap was on the
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:13.120]  ground supporting him I've had enough of it and now I want my guns how are my
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.960]  grandfathers dead in the grave and George Soros is still running around
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:24.440]  crapping on everyone Jerry and George is a veteran what's your take on all this
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:30.880]  go ahead Jerry hi I was served in the first 39 during the Cold War I was
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.520]  stationed in Bonn, Florida, Germany and it's breaking my heart to see our us
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:40.400]  going back into this and people people are just asleep I mean they're
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.840]  completely asleep they're not paying attention to the news they don't
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.200]  understand that the severity of what we're walking into again and I looked
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.080]  up to see if my old unit was even even stationed Germany more it's been
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.280]  dissolved half of what we used to have back there we don't have any teeth in
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:01.720]  Europe anymore so what it's like the only options they have is an air war or
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:07.840]  or tactical nuclear war and that's that's horrifying too I mean just by the way
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:15.720]  seconds ago crummy a full vote 95% to join Russia and I just wish people would
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.280]  the only way to reach people I think is to ask the question why is Obama
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:26.120]  McCain Kerry why are they supporting a Nazi government well I mean it's true I
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.240]  mean it really everybody says this is Nazi that's Nazi the government
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.880]  McCain and then put in is literally a Nazi government I mean they are
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:41.160]  literally Nazis that say slobs are subhuman it's insanity it's total
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.480]  mental illness I bless you for what you're doing and I just can't believe it
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.840]  I can't believe we're going back into this this is craziness well I mean here's
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.040]  my deal the Russians generally in history and from my study tell me if I'm
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.720]  wrong will not attack you unless you attack them then they will attack you
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:02.120]  full power in 2008 they threatened to nuke NATO and NATO backed off what are we
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.280]  going to do if they threaten to nuke again and NATO says do it I mean there
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:13.080]  is nuclear war all because Obama wants to put Russian kids in dresses
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:22.160]  hey Alex it if some poor government came into Puerto Rico and affected their
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.720]  elections and then said we're now we're the legitimate government US would be
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:33.320]  there tomorrow and that's that's exactly what we're doing we have no business
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.120]  over there and we should be pulling these guys out of office whoever I would
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.960]  love it if you would have a campaign with all your Arizona listeners and get
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.280]  McCain out of office very well said excellent call Jerry I'm gonna repeat
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.480]  what you said we came back for everybody that's a good point if
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.560]  somebody in the open mess with the election overthrew Puerto Rico the US
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.000]  military be there in five minutes I mean that's what the Russians are doing I'm
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.840]  sorry to have to side with the Russians I mean why does the United States spend
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.800]  the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare why do we have the
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:10.040]  highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:16.160]  every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat our

[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.680]  George Soros takeover of the internet that's not my words that's a US
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.560]  relinquished remaining control over the internet that's the washed in post and as
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.680]  bad as the US government is I don't like who's about to get it it's even worse
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:01.200]  because they're the folks that run the US government that's all coming up but
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:06.760]  listen McCain has said they want to give military support to the Ukrainian
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.520]  government that they just funded to overthrow the elected government when
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:14.280]  the Ukraine wouldn't join the EU to be sucked drive like Spain and Italy and
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.400]  Greece and so many others Iceland the list goes on and on that economic
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.760]  bondage and then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dempsey under Obama orders
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.760]  said I am ready for military action against Russia upon your order main
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:33.160]  future so all of that is being announced and a US predator drone was brought
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.560]  down shot down by electronic warfare ordering it to crash from 12,000 feet
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:43.960]  on Friday that has hardly been in the US news though Reuters carried it so you've
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.080]  got hundreds of thousands of the million men reserve Ukrainian army
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:53.080]  massing on the Crimean border that just voted polls closed and the Italian is
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:58.720]  complete 95% vote for the generally Russian held on to claim it's been part
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.520]  of Russia for 200 years only recently part of Ukraine since World War two they
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:09.440]  are now because the Nazis kicked the Russians out of out of Ukraine and then
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.520]  kind of the leftover the Nazis are now attacking show the Russians have voted to
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:21.120]  join Russia there in the Russian held on a claim of of Crimea and you've got all
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.400]  these other referendums the less supports dozens of them but they do not
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.400]  support a breakaway here I mean the Venice is voting to break away from
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.000]  Italy Scotland's voted to break away from the UK
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.320]  Catalonia is voting to break away from Spain and there's a whole bunch of
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.880]  examples of this you're not hearing about military action we had a caller
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.080]  earlier a veteran call in who made the point that imagine if a foreign power
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:54.240]  the Russians per se had financed a political takeover of Puerto Rico you
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.760]  would see the US military there not leaving its bases that's what Russia's
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.800]  done I'm not never been to Russia don't have a drop of Russian blood in me
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:06.800]  folks so I'm not siding with Russia but the globalist run America and NATO in
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:11.520]  the EU they're starting the fight and this could really get explosive I want
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.600]  to hurry through your calls we got Mike and Cole and Stephen and Victor and
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:19.400]  Daniel and Todd and Jason and market Steve all veterans give your quick
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.080]  point please I'll go the next person do you agree with me do you disagree if you
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:27.160]  disagree tell me how I'm wrong because I've got to be honest I mean if they were
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.680]  trying to put in some Swiss style government was pro-gun pro-liberty
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.160]  kicked the bankers out I'd say okay I don't kind of like it but okay you know
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.520]  Russia shouldn't influence I mean I want free countries out there but this is the
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.640]  globalist coming in to set up an EU tyranny there so that's my issue and
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.400]  now we're getting a new Cold War out of it we're bankrupt folks Obama wants a
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.960]  political distraction the EU's unpopular they want a new distraction
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.000]  that's why they want to start the new Cold War and Putin likes it Putin's
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.520]  approval ratings exploding that's an AP I read that earlier so there's my
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:02.760]  geopolitical analysis this is bad for people we don't want a new Cold War
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:09.280]  folks we're bankrupt Mike in California am I wrong what's your take no man you're
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:16.360]  absolutely right about everything you're talking about it feels like they've
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.120]  changed the timetable on us with all of the things that they're pushing out
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:26.200]  their Obamacare legalizing the legal they're flushing the system absolutely
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.760]  flushing the system and this might be going along with that one thing I want
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.640]  I want to make this quick because I know you've got a lot of cars gonna get to
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:39.200]  when I want to let you do your wonderful job sir but please God will hang
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.800]  how big on recently that is fight we need you on brother please go out there
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.600]  with that man work with him I know I hear you I hear you but we're on the
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.920]  topic of Ukraine we had we had the former state police and top school
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.720]  safety expert on he runs a big company that you know vices colleges you name
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.280]  it saying Sandy Hook was totally fake and he's about to fall suit over it and
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.400]  of course it was obviously fake I just don't know how much of it was fake they
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.960]  had green screens actors I mean I can't believe how bold this government is how
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:16.160]  illegitimate it is thank you Mike Jason in Florida you're on the year go ahead
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:22.920]  hey Alex after I got out of the army I worked about 10 years in Ukraine and
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:27.600]  well if I worked about a year and a half and then worked a little over seven
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.800]  half years in Russia for an aerospace company I think a lot of people aren't
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.000]  understanding you know there's a there's a lot of animosity between Russian
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.280]  and the Western Ukrainians that we kind of don't understand because back to
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.960]  World War two well it goes back before that when Stalin starved in million of
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:51.000]  them yes exactly exactly and then with the Western Ukrainians helping the
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.880]  Nazis during World War two so there's a dynamic there that I think a lot of
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:01.320]  Americans don't understand and also I mean the Crimean thing the Russians I
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.360]  mean Putin's not gonna get this up Russians aren't gonna get this up they
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.760]  fought the British they fought the French and the Turkish to a standstill on a
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.040]  war in the 1850s over this place that's right no no the Russians have fought
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.920]  eight different wars I was looking it up and the last 400 years over the Crimean
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:22.400]  I mean this is the war zone yes sir and what's scared I mean what's scared the
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.360]  hell out of me is I have a wife who's eight months pregnant and I can tell you
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.080]  from firsthand experience we get some really arrogant this is firsthand
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:35.600]  experience really arrogant really incompetent people working in our
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.120]  intelligence community they're pretty much just yes man and yes women yeah
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.380]  they run around playing the part of James Bond but they don't put in the
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:48.000]  hours exactly exactly I mean I come I come from a very poor coal mining
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.680]  family for me from Mountain East Tennessee you know we're as tough as we
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.480]  could as tough as they come and these people over here in Russia you know
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.000]  there's no slouches they're pretty tough I can tell you from again almost decade
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.720]  of living with them and being in their country there's tough as they come and
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:09.840]  they're really smart and what really scares me right now is Putin he's no
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.080]  idiot this guy is a master chess player he's not gonna let United States or
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:20.320]  NATO build up a force that's capable of busting down the conventional Russian
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.600]  army he spent too much time building up in the early 2000s after he took over
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.960]  from for Yeltsin that's right but they put him in because they've decided to go
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.720]  with a new czarist model he's their new strong man he's their figurehead
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:36.720]  they're totally committed and again the globalists don't want any sovereign
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.240]  countries they don't want a strong America either and so they're going the
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.400]  way of John Wayne over there we're going the way of Obama wanting to put five
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:49.560]  year old schoolboys in dresses and and I mean literally I mean we are losing the
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:54.800]  moral high ground worldwide anything else it's scarier than that I mean you
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.560]  know people remember back before George and invasion I mean they changed that
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:03.280]  you know Russia changed the doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons and they
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.840]  pretty much let the world know that they'll use them first strike you know
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.880]  if they have that was the press conference they said we've rolled the
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.160]  missiles in before our doctrine we said that we would fire when fired upon we
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.280]  now reserve the right to fire first because you are invading and that's
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.320]  what that exactly they're threatening to nuke NATO bases and folks even if
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.560]  NATO can end up beating Russia in the end it's going to mean nuclear winner oh
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.280]  I cannot believe it and which the globalists may do as a war against
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.320]  America because once a nuclear war starts even a limited one they're gonna
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:40.120]  be able to take all of our rights they will definitely come arrest me they
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.280]  will definitely shut down all opposition they're gonna arrest Rand Paul I
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.840]  guarantee you folks Obama hates America enough to start a war with Russia so he
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.720]  can become a dictator Putin's becoming a dictator out of this I'm telling you
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:16:00.800]  folks war is the health of the state this is bad we'll be right back the facts
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.440]  are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the

[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.680]  American people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.480]  simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:21.560]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of

[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.760]  the Ukraine situation he before it flared up and he basically he's mirrored
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:43.520]  what we've said I'm about justice I don't pick sides and on a scale of one to
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:51.400]  10 Russia involved in US interest is about a one on a scale of one to ten you
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:57.280]  know zero being no influence bad influence and then you look on the
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:03.200]  other end of it you've got a 10 you know being total bad influence Russia's about
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:10.840]  a one doing bad things to America the communist Chinese are about a six they're
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.320]  involved the Federal Reserve manipulating our debt controlling Hollywood
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.800]  financing anti-gun movements I mean the chai comms are really messing with our
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.400]  lives they really are business allied with the globalist there's six or seven
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:29.960]  George Soros the UN the New World Order the private offshore Federal Reserve the
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.400]  foreign banks that own our insurance companies that wrote Obamacare they are
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:42.920]  a 11 to quote spinal tap 110% folks that's an 11 they are trying to destroy
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:46.720]  this country they are overrunning everything attacking our families
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:51.280]  attacking our dollar I mean my family I'm not bragging folks both sides on the
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.120]  Mayflower all over the place the Revolutionary War started the Texas
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:58.520]  Revolution literally started it I'm not going to get into all the names and all
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:03.080]  the rest of it it's off the chart I mean I'm as an American as it gets and it
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.080]  makes me want to vomit when I see news articles attacking Ron Paul because he's
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.600]  against World War three and attacking Russia for George Soros you have the
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:18.280]  article earlier we put it up I mean look Ron Paul and I know the history there
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:24.520]  it is Ron Paul supporting Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea you know
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:32.040]  these are the type of headlines and of course that's the daily beast the
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:37.200]  Democrats know and they put him next to Putin like like they play kissy kiss or
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:41.400]  something Ron Paul doesn't go speak in Russia he goes and speaks with the
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.600]  former Czech Republic right-wing president who's actually against the
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.360]  globalists in the EU and for national sovereignty Ron Paul likes Alexander
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:54.000]  Schultz and Eatzen who was anti-communist to the core Ron Paul the opposite of a
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.120]  communist he's the opposite of a Russian authoritarian supporter he knows a crime
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:05.000]  when he sees one and he knows the EU overthrew the elected government and has
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.640]  now pushed the Russians and their assets right to the border so they just kept
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:13.480]  their gas pipelines and military bases and the Russians I'm gonna go back to your
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:19.520]  calls it's just so frustrating I support American interest I support the
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:24.920]  Republic I bleed red white and blue I love the ideas of America I admire our
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:29.320]  country we were special we were unique we were the best and now we've been
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:33.120]  overrun by a bunch of globalist crooks trying to weaken our culture dumb us
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.000]  down destroy our families and they want to do the same thing to the Russians and
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  the Russians aren't perfect but they've been saying no to that folks and the
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.320]  globalists are scared because of America ever became free and if Russia ever
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:49.280]  became free and if we ever linked up and work together for a better world
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:53.680]  folks it would be a better world only Russia and the US can get their act
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:58.600]  together for a space program the Russians are smart folks we need to be
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.600]  friends with the Russians and not let British intelligence who's been doing
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:06.200]  this since the Civil War divide us off from each other it's all divide and
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.120]  conquer and then they're gonna launch a new Cold War and that's why Ron Paul
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:15.720]  sick of this because he wants a unified libertarian free market planet like I do
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:20.400]  where we're where whether you live in Africa or Russia or China or Mexico or
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.440]  the US you're unified by free market private property second amendment
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:31.920]  family that unifies race color creed religion around independence around
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:39.040]  freedom I mean it's so sick how ignorant most Americans are against this war I
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.480]  saw a poll 80 plus percent are against it so I should say most Americans are
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.240]  dumb but I mean if Americans do just how bad this is just how dangerous this is
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:51.240]  I said I'd go to your calls I've loaded phone lines like 15 veterans holding
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:55.520]  Steve Mark all of you I'm gonna get to everybody and I'll cover the UN news
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.240]  where they're taking over the internet seat we're being conquered by the
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:02.640]  globalist the Rockefellers created the UN and if you look at the treaties we've
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.920]  got we're signing everything over to them the banks the taxes the guns the
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.560]  internet the telecommunications the military we're being conquered by the
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:18.120]  new world order and they're now knocking down Russia's doors to start a war
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:24.200]  with them in my name my enemy is the new world order not the Russians the Russians
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:28.680]  do anything to me I'll get in their face don't you understand that I see the
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:33.600]  Russians surrounded by the new world order it makes me sick just like we've
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:39.240]  been overtaken by them that's why I don't like what's happening over there and
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.120]  the Russians can now become authoritarian in the name of defending
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.480]  themselves which will kill their reforms the globalists know making them
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.080]  authoritarian will kill their country they given them the poison of
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:56.160]  authoritarianism to survive just like they fund Al Qaeda to attack us and then
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:59.960]  take our liberties and destroy our economy we lose 40 billion a year just in
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:03.680]  hotels alone because foreigners won't come here because the TSA seeing any
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.400]  reported that years ago they have screwed us so many ways it makes me want
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:12.800]  to throw up they want to kill commerce they want to kill free market they want
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.560]  to kill prosperity to make us dependent and it makes me sick makes me sick I
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:21.360]  want the globalist out of my country they're the ones trying to take my kids
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:28.120]  take my guns take my language dumb me down overrun me they're the enemy let's
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.320]  jam a call if we're going to break now come back and phone blitz Steven Texas
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.960]  sorry I'm ranting go ahead it's okay I'll listen our retired naval
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:41.560]  intelligence everything that's going on right now was wargamed in 08 and 09 the
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:47.960]  Crimea in the Crimea right now is a diversionary theater once we tie down
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:53.720]  the Russians the 76th Division you're going to have forces going into Syria
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.680]  because they've cut off the unit that was going to be sent to Syria to stop us
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.840]  there the 76th Air Mobile Division and you're going to see in the Saudis in
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:06.920]  the air and the Israelis doing airstrikes and Iran all of this is a
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:11.880]  diversionary theater to tie down Russian ground forces so that we can go back to
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.720]  what we were doing six months ago in Syria and Iran and what is your view I
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:24.280]  agree with you on that what is your view of that morally well you know what I
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:29.760]  was in the Navy I had an oath to do what I was supposed to do for the country as
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.120]  a civilian I can speak a little bit more freely and like you I don't want to see
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:38.640]  my children obliterated in a nuclear war which that's what the Russians are
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.960]  going to do if they get tied down and their port in Syria is being attacked
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.120]  I have no other choice they're going to use tactical nukes and they have a
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.120]  different view towards towards nukes than we do because when they're
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:56.880]  surrounded they get that that isolation fear and so they strike out they will
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:01.400]  use tactical nukes they will use them in the Ukraine they have no love for
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.840]  Ukrainians they will use them against the German that's their primary nuke
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.440]  target that's actually you know what you're talking about that's true wow
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.880]  power just went out and I'll say I'll finish with one little thing we've had
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:18.840]  seals doing clothing reconnaissance along with the Marine Corps recon in the
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:24.280]  Sea of Azov since 2010 so what will probably happen with the task force
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:31.160]  which the flag of that task force is the USS HW Bush they're gonna be mining
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:35.480]  the Black Sea that way the Soviet or the Russian Navy well you know what you're
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.920]  talking about stay there don't hang up I want to come back and let you talk
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:41.320]  some more that's why I want the military to call in and the military

[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:44.120]  Michael Victor Daniel will get to all of you if the West was moral and trying to
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:48.160]  put in a good government there I would go with George Washington and say it's
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.320]  still it you know we shouldn't be in foreign entanglements but we liberated
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:55.840]  North Korea I'd kind of probably get behind it but not it was going to cause
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.400]  a nuclear war the Russians are not as dirty as the globalists now and the
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.800]  Russians are pretty darn bad folks their government I'm not romanticizing it but
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:08.200]  I've studied it the New World Order has conquered us is what I'm saying they now
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:12.680]  want to be able to take down Syria they're very mad that six months ago
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:19.120]  that got derailed and but go back to 2008 with the Georgia situation where
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.880]  the Russians rolled in with the troops in NATO backed off I understand it's a
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:26.480]  diversionary tactic also politically it's diversionary a lot of stuff going
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:31.440]  on inside the EU we were talking to Steve who is former naval intelligence and
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.960]  you hear how smart he is so next time you hear Bill Maher make fun of the
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.200]  military or Henry Kissinger call them dumb stupid animals and stuff in my
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.000]  experience military people even if they're folks that were enlisted no
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.840]  more than the general public because they've lived inside of it that's why
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:49.200]  we're taking military calls today they haven't gotten any calls yet from Russia
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.520]  or from Ukraine I don't try to get calls from there actually get calls from
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.280]  there but we're not getting those calls Steve make other points about where you
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:01.280]  see this is going and the question of the moral issue I mean they're gonna put
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:06.200]  people even worse into the Ukraine now I mean that's pretty bad absolutely let
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:11.360]  me make a couple of more points and then I'll get up from firstly the fields have
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:17.440]  been infiltrating like I said the Crimean area Rostov on Don is a very
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:24.520]  important target what they're doing is reconnaissance for nuclear target the
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:29.240]  the NATO forces are trying to end politically also the State Department
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:34.480]  they want the Soviets to do a first-strike nuclear hit because what the
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:39.720]  retaliation is going to be and I know based on the war game scenarios there's
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:44.720]  four or five missile submarines with the task force with the with the George
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:49.600]  Bush and what they want to do is they're gonna hit the targets that the fields
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:55.360]  have been reconning since 2010 but they can't hit those targets until the
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.000]  Russians launch tactical nukes first in the Ukraine NATO doesn't care about the
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  Ukraine that's a throwaway country for them and if they can obliterate it then
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.360]  they can bottle up the black city fleet by doing nuclear strikes on the
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.400]  strategic target then they can't get out and then they'll marshal planet and
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.200]  make hundreds of billions quote rebuilding it yes but it's important to
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:20.280]  remember what unit they're trying to bottle up in South Africa you had the
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.320]  76th air mobile division which is one of the very Russian divisions made up
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:30.160]  of all the highly trained volunteers there's no conscripts in that division
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:35.520]  and that division was earmarked for Syria a few months ago if they've got
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:39.800]  them bottled up in a conflict in Crimea then they can't go down and fight in
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:44.960]  Syria and you're going to have al-Qaeda force just like before with Western
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.560]  advisors usually Australian and British SAS are going to lead these guys
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:54.320]  through Syria when Syria falls you've got Iran's blank we can go straight into
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:37:00.000]  Iran because the Israelis are going crazy wanting to attack Iran and that's
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.520]  that's the final sure and I totally agree with your analysis spot on so so how
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.360]  does it all end it ends if it follows the war game that we're going to be
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:14.680]  launching on the Crimea in the Ukraine area with nukes to bottle up the black
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.280]  city fleet so we can do other things in other area in areas namely Syria and
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.840]  Iran that's the end game now undoubtedly the Russians understand all this what
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:29.480]  they may do something unwork the docks and move with a gambit well you know
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:32.920]  that's where the Chinese come in there they're gonna talk to Chinese and to
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:37.560]  helping them and flank around where NATO blocking forces are that's where the
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:42.640]  Chinese come in and the Chinese you know as everybody knows can be bribed and
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:50.920]  that's how work what do you as a father think of this well I hope that that I'll
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:56.320]  be I have a copy of a Joel Scousen strategic relocation and I have a
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.920]  place in the strategically safe zones in the Ozark probably close to you Alex
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.200]  it's just incredible again this would be bad enough that we were trying to
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.360]  actually sell freedom over there they're trying to go over there and sell
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.520]  Hollywood and and putting little boys in dresses and breaking up families and I
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:20.040]  mean it's just so crazy that I don't think all the liberals and all the
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:25.400]  politicos and all the fake intelligence people really get how much
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:29.880]  danger they're in I mean this might not end it just some tactical nuke war this
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:34.360]  could end with just the destruction of humanity well you've heard the old
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:41.160]  saying these people that are running our society they're shooting for the person
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.040]  with the most toys wins they're looking for world domination and don't care how
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:50.360]  many of us sheep that they kill Alex and that's the bottom line what was your
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.480]  information on Georgia what happened with that because Russia rolled in the
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:58.480]  medium-range mobile nuke launchers said we're gonna start hitting NATO targets
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.640]  and NATO backed out they wanted to see which units would deploy the South
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:07.560]  Assyria because from the Western intelligence they knew that they would
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:13.800]  send their best troops it was also 76 division that's how the West made the
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:18.720]  assessment of which unit to isolate with their next phase which was Crimea and
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:22.800]  that's exactly the unit that was sent there the 76 they're more sure but you
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:26.680]  know the Russians are gonna have other elite units in reserve well they've got
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:32.880]  Spetsnaz but Spetsnaz are your special operators they're just there they're not
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.760]  primary combat for what about this situation you know Europe England and
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:42.000]  the United States are penetrated with Russian sleeper agents do you expect
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.920]  them to activate Alex I'll tell you something probably two years before I
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:53.040]  retired one of those agents sat at a desk a desk next to me he's in Leavenworth
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:57.920]  now our military is completely penetrated by Russian agents and usually
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:03.720]  American guys that the Russians send hot blockers to try and bring them
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:06.680]  over to their side believe me I know what happened when you have a hot
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.280]  girlfriend who has that sexy little Russian accent isn't it Alex I've had
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:15.120]  them sin I've had the Russian sin hot blondes it mean twice there you go
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:18.760]  that's how it works I had a guy sitting at desk right next to me career guy
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:23.920]  lieutenant commander had a wife and family and the Russian girlfriend was
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:29.120]  his downfall he's sitting in the prison for the rest of his life wow yeah no
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.400]  telling how compromised our our strategic planning is no telling well
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.840]  that's my point is that even if it was moral it's it's like a Mexican standoff
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:47.000]  but I mean our country is is rotting the globalists are a bunch of just I mean
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.840]  it's so dangerous I don't think do you agree with me this is incredibly
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.160]  dangerous and the public has no idea how much danger we're in absolutely but
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:01.040]  they're making they're making decisions based on analysis of what they think
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:04.200]  they're gonna be able to get away with and they're trying to pin the Russian
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:10.480]  military down in the Crimea sure that they can hit Syria Iran Iran's the main
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.800]  thing because the Israelis are screaming they're going crazy wanting to hit
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.720]  Iran right now and the Saudi well what about this I was told I was told by a
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:22.080]  high-level military officer and confirmed with special forces people I
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.840]  know have given me good information the best their word is Iran's had nukes for
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:32.400]  years absolutely so why do the Israelis want to hit them now and then why do you
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.800]  think it's so scary that they're deploying naval cruisers to their new bases
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:44.600]  in Venezuela the Iranians want to zap us with EMP that's their main goal this
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:50.680]  is insane company in our atmosphere I guess I'm talking about that no I know
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:56.160]  it's just it's I just want to live my life and and again if our government was
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:59.560]  trying to promote family and private property and stuff it'd be bad enough
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:04.000]  that our government is so illegitimate run by all these globalist interests and
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.560]  I just hope you know Dempsey and others did go to Obama and tell them don't
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.120]  attack Syria but but I guess you're saying that was just they said give us
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:16.960]  time I mean do you have any information on what happened there
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:22.480]  Dempsey made a deal like you said and Obama said all right we're gonna back
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.600]  off now but we're gonna go forward with what was wargamed in 08 at the war
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:31.920]  college and that's our new of course there's multi scenarios with every war
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:39.120]  gaming strategy but Obama as what he told Dempsey then was we're going with
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:43.160]  this but we're gonna go in a different area we're gonna block the Russians and
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:47.720]  perhaps that'll prevent any collateral damage in the colonists the continental
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.240]  United States there were two plans very interesting very interesting well God
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.560]  bless you appreciate that call more calls from veterans coming up military

[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:39.840]  this internet thing big time is as important as while we're busy watching
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:44.640]  the Russian thing the Malaysian flight thing all the rest of it and dancing with
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:49.600]  the stars whatever other folks watch they are just seizing the infrastructure the
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:55.360]  globalist are that sit above the nations and play us off against each other I hope
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.280]  they back off but if you read as a visit as a big presence key and others who
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.000]  are advising Obama they've been wanting a tactical nuclear war with the Russians
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:09.720]  for a long time and it's just a bad situation if it starts up and it is a
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:14.680]  possibility I'm not saying it's gonna happen but most mainline analysts say
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:18.360]  this is more dangerous than anything in the Cold War because back then the
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.440]  Russians were expanding the Russians were bullies the Russians were bad guys
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:26.120]  the Russians are surrounded right now and the West is trying to overthrow their
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:32.920]  government it and now they've got strong leaders and they're in a defensive
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:38.480]  stance it's a serious situation I mean there's no word to describe it Todd and
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:41.720]  Canada you're on the air we'll just cover this to the end of the show go ahead
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:47.520]  Todd I'm doing all right are you guys a really screwing thing up for me down
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:53.400]  there man I live part-time in Russia my wife and my family's over there my
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:58.880]  father-in-law is ex-military Russian military back during the Cold War years
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:03.400]  and I could tell you a lot of stories right now they're just talking about
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:10.120]  doing economic sanctions against Europe and USA right now no I know the Russians
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.840]  are just talking about sanctions but Kerry and others are talking about active
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:21.840]  military action in Crimea oh yes yes yes I know but right now on on the Russian
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:25.280]  media there that's all they're talking about is they're not going into as far
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:30.440]  as what Russia is going to do from their side of the story and we're also taking
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:37.400]  your average Russian on the street does not want a war period yeah I'm an I'm
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:43.440]  the average American I don't want a war and I mean and over there like Russian
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:46.600]  kids like when they turn 18 they have to serve three years the military
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.880]  mandatory mandatory service right now they have a draft they're not even
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.520]  waiting until you're 18 they're bringing them in like right now so I don't know
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:00.560]  exactly what they're what they're doing or what exactly is going on there but
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:04.200]  it's looking pretty bad all I know is in three months I gotta fly into that
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:09.000]  historic man so interesting God bless you Tom we're gonna jump now the Russians
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.360]  are building up militarily and the West is providing the pressure to build up
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:17.880]  that new enemy because again when you put pressure on them that just put in the
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:22.640]  power to build up a paramilitary and you know domestic force and a larger
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:29.600]  blue water Navy the the new generation of missiles all of it it's just another
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:36.480]  Cold War meanwhile we're under agenda 21 UN takeover Victor in Tennessee you're

[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:16.040]  just happening I mean and I don't know how we're gonna defend ourselves against
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:20.400]  it no no I agree it's special interest on all sides that make money off conflict
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:24.120]  instead of free market instead of real things that help people and they're
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:28.720]  gonna get there was a top British analyst and government official I forget
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:32.200]  his name like two months ago came out and said look our governments are
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.640]  creating crises to stay in power and they're gonna end up causing a world
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:39.800]  war three they they are screwing things up on purpose I appreciate your call
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:45.440]  this is just out from Reuters top Russian journalist on state-run media has
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:50.880]  said quote in Reuters we can turn your country into radioactive ash and we'll
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:55.180]  put that back on screen for folks that are watching us on television but
[01:51:55.180 --> 01:52:00.280]  anybody that's listening on radio can just search into that there it is the
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:05.920]  article again for folks that would like to be able to pull that up it's a Russia
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:11.680]  can turn the US to radioactive ash or Kremlin back journalist and so that's
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:14.600]  the type of things that are coming out Russia is the only country in the world
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.400]  that is realistically capable of turning the United States to radioactive ash
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:22.640]  television presenter Dmitry pronounce his name right Kizlov said on his weekly
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:26.000]  current affairs show that guy was putting power over that channel by
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.080]  Vladimir Putin so that's basically Putin speaking through a proxy let's go
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.600]  ahead and talk to Daniel in Wisconsin thanks for holding her on the air
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:38.240]  welcome yes Alex I was in the ADA when I was in the military protecting the
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:45.480]  West Germany from my Russian East West East Germany and now in other words there's
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:51.200]  the same outfit now that the Democrats and others have laughed because they're
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:55.080]  trying to stay you know what we said yeah we can get a missile with a missile
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:58.520]  give us the money we'll develop the missile and they said well it's like
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:02.600]  hitting the bullet with a bullet well these people never shot trapped they
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:07.520]  never shot ducks never shot anything it's a matter of mathematical mathematics
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:13.320]  of course we can do it and we proved it but so what did Obama do devastated the
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:20.880]  generals devastated Miller middle officers and even a lot of sergeants
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:26.240]  that don't walk our step with Obama that's another great point they've been
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:29.520]  purging the military of the best commanders from the highest brass on
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:34.480]  down what do you think's going on here holy smokes I'm gonna tell you the truth
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:41.360]  I really don't know and the threat no Putin was through carry what what if
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:47.040]  Putin comes back and say guess what Obama tell Obama how's he gonna go to
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:53.320]  the space station and we're good friends with China we're gonna purchase a lot
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:58.120]  of their debt that you own for 50 cents on a dollar and then we're gonna demand
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:03.840]  it what's gonna happen then well it's it's basically the new world order that
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:07.200]  runs the US acting out they're in a corner now with all their fraud and
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:12.080]  corruption so they're trying to start a fight as a diversion great points you're
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:15.880]  right it's just it's just general craziness I mean the wicked flea went
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.600]  unpersu as the Bible says and the globalists that run this country in
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:23.120]  Europe they're just trying to start a new war so they can shut down their
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:28.520]  political competition I'll talk to Cole in South Carolina you're on the air cold
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:33.920]  thanks for having me on I agree with most of what is being said tonight but
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:39.200]  I disagree and and I did a blog it's called Americans must grow up over US
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:45.080]  foreign policy and this is about dollar destabilization I mean it's a lot more
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:52.400]  than that but bricks as you know all these nations that hold part of our debt
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:57.920]  plan to dump the dollar and if because the Federal Reserve has been devaluing
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:03.680]  it yeah I agree I agree I mean everything that you say I'm not saying
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:06.640]  bricks is good either that's what I mean but I mean the globalists are the
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:11.520]  prime mover they're the one doing it all yeah I understand and I agree with
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:16.280]  that I just what on my blog I just talk about how really the game has changed and
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:21.120]  and right now we pretty much have a golden gun to our head quote I don't know
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:26.840]  James Bond movie I didn't like that movie but you know because their gold is you
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:33.400]  know as you know China has 8% or 8 their rank 8th in the world's Chinese the
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:37.040]  Russians University of Texas all big institutions are hoarding gold and we're
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:41.440]  sitting on top of a big global pile of fake derivatives that the globalists
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:45.400]  want to use our nuclear weapons to enforce the world to accept as they
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:50.320]  keep devaluing and and so it's just all coming towards a crisis and we don't
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:54.000]  know what that crisis will be this could be it we hope it isn't I appreciate your
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.400]  call I mean look my interest is just survival I just want to have a free
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:01.320]  country I want to go forward into the future but all these crises are coming
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:05.560]  to a head Hassan I think I pronounced that right in Holland what's your take

[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:29.280]  Germany but I would like to say another news actually which is do you remember
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:36.840]  George Zimmerman and Taylor Martin yes yeah I do you know George German said it
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:40.920]  was God's plan you know I don't know I'm not on that subject right now I
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:44.280]  appreciate your call though we're almost out of time here I'll be back tomorrow
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:49.680]  11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central the weekday show we'll discuss this more Mark in
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:52.480]  Texas another veteran you're gonna take us out start all the other callers
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:56.720]  right of time mark what's your take on Ukraine briefly Ukraine is we need to
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:00.960]  mind our own business the Ukraine by the way the Western part of the Ukraine
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:06.120]  actually belongs to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the East always belong to
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:12.320]  pretty much always belong to Russia the other thing is three things can come out
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:15.880]  of this three bad things one of the least would be another cold war which
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:19.040]  had been enough the other is a conventional war which we could lose
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:23.440]  hundreds of thousand American soldiers and God knows how many other people the
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:27.640]  third possibility of a thermonuclear war so these neocons and these other
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:32.000]  globalists better shut their mouth stop it already I think that's a great way to
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.680]  end the show God bless you yeah that's it exactly I mean look I don't not
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:41.120]  following George Soros in the war with Russia you to put him back in a time
