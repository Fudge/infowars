[08:28.040 --> 08:51.280]  network. Judge Smales is with us now live, hold me down Billy, $40,000 Billy, I was just
[08:51.280 --> 08:54.560]  talking about that in the last segment all these Democrats literally keeps
[08:54.560 --> 08:58.680]  keep jumping around like they're winning something because Obama is in
[08:58.680 --> 09:02.240]  charge and wrecking the country and screwing them with Obamacare and tax
[09:02.240 --> 09:07.280]  increases and payroll taxes on poor people seven taxes on the working class
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.200]  and poor on record seven taxes breaking every promise hiring more lobbyist
[09:12.200 --> 09:19.640]  funding al-Qaeda publicly Benghazi the list goes on and on trashing a dollar and
[09:19.640 --> 09:27.400]  they worship him as the second coming of Christ as Jamie Foxx says he's our
[09:27.400 --> 09:31.000]  Lord and Savior and then literally starts acting like Judge Smales from
[09:31.000 --> 09:41.640]  Caddyshack going oh oh oh oh Barack Obama it goes on and on and on I mean how
[09:41.640 --> 09:50.560]  do you like everyone getting a payroll tax increase under Obamacare how do you
[09:50.560 --> 09:58.240]  like everyone facing the prospect of losing their doctor and having the
[09:58.240 --> 10:03.200]  prices double triple or quadruple. Humana in Texas up five hundred and some
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.800]  percent on average and then they sit there and go well our master plan is
[10:08.800 --> 10:11.680]  to actually wreck healthcare and bring in true socialism they're not going to
[10:11.680 --> 10:15.960]  bring you true socialism morons true socialism never exists and never will
[10:15.960 --> 10:21.000]  the elites convince you to give over your hard-earned work product and that
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.040]  they're going to redistribute it to you and then you're so poor surviving off
[10:25.040 --> 10:29.040]  the little dribble they give you back that you end up believing that you're
[10:29.040 --> 10:32.160]  living in a good world when you're actually domesticated animal in a cage
[10:32.160 --> 10:39.920]  being fed and that's what this comes down to ladies and gentlemen all right
[10:39.920 --> 10:42.960]  what are we gonna get in today I you know first thing I'm gonna get into was
[10:42.960 --> 10:46.880]  Obamacare because I saw this LeBron James TV ad and I've been seeing all these
[10:46.880 --> 10:53.360]  other movie stars and rock-and-roll people and sports figures out promoting it
[10:53.360 --> 10:57.760]  that that you know you need to go sign up right now and in the case of LeBron
[10:57.760 --> 11:04.280]  James I don't think he's very smart in fact I've heard him give interviews he
[11:04.280 --> 11:12.200]  sounds extremely stupid and where is you've got other folks who early on were
[11:12.200 --> 11:16.960]  critical of Obama because they went under pressure Charles Barkley and are
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.080]  now supportive of him Charles Barkley of course knows full well and three years
[11:21.080 --> 11:25.400]  ago spoke out against Obamacare and now he doesn't because he's basically sold
[11:25.400 --> 11:30.440]  out it's very shameful but anybody that's run businesses or anybody that has a
[11:30.440 --> 11:38.160]  high IQ or even a mid-level IQ knows that this is a total screw job that's why
[11:38.160 --> 11:44.240]  I get mad at a Leonardo DiCaprio or a person like there's a lot of other
[11:44.240 --> 11:48.760]  examples out there Jamie Foxx I've heard him do interviews he's real smart he
[11:48.760 --> 11:54.440]  still gets behind the Obama bandwagon because they want to be part of the
[11:54.440 --> 11:58.320]  quote winning team and screw everybody else but I can't really get mad at LeBron
[11:58.320 --> 12:05.280]  James he literally is a sucker idiot being conned into quote helping humanity
[12:05.280 --> 12:10.360]  by going out and pushing on young people who the White House admits is their
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.720]  main strategy because they aren't reading the bill and aren't reading the
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.200]  newspaper and don't know what's in the law and so you want they want to get
[12:18.200 --> 12:22.760]  them signed up so they can be screwed by Obamacare and they're going oh it's not
[12:22.760 --> 12:27.800]  too much it's only $300 a month or so yeah healthcare was about $100 a month
[12:27.800 --> 12:33.260]  for somebody under 30 before Obamacare passed now it's $200 $300 and it's
[12:33.260 --> 12:38.080]  projected to be $600 for the average person below 30 or so within two years
[12:38.080 --> 12:44.000]  so you get ready to have 600 grabbed out of your bank account every month one way
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.320]  or another because if you don't go get the healthcare and pay it the IRS is
[12:48.320 --> 12:51.000]  going to say well you waived all your rights and came and signed up at Obamacare
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.360]  at healthcare.gov and the 17,000 agents they hired three years ago are going to
[12:56.360 --> 13:00.480]  go suck the money out of your account and we pointed to that was going out and
[13:00.480 --> 13:06.080]  happening in the legislation people said that's a conspiracy theory there's no
[13:06.080 --> 13:10.360]  plan for the IRS to take your wages or bank account or garnishment well then
[13:10.360 --> 13:16.280]  last month they put on the IRS website IRS.gov really a private collection
[13:16.280 --> 13:21.240]  agency of the private fellow reserve but regardless it has government powers they
[13:21.240 --> 13:26.440]  came out and they said oh yeah we're gonna start jerking the money out of
[13:26.440 --> 13:31.320]  your account and then we'll have penalties and interest on it you know if
[13:31.320 --> 13:34.360]  you haven't paid it when we jerk your account so it's not gonna be $5,000 a
[13:34.360 --> 13:39.160]  year it's gonna be 10 15 20,000 we might wait three four years let the penalties
[13:39.160 --> 13:42.080]  and interest build up before we snatch your bank account then we'll do
[13:42.080 --> 13:46.880]  settlement deals with you. Isn't that a sweet thing for the poor?
[13:46.880 --> 13:53.640]  Well our healthcare system was in trouble so we had to do something yeah it was in
[13:53.640 --> 13:57.120]  trouble because big banks took control of it in the last 50 years and started
[13:57.120 --> 14:01.560]  creating different scams to build the public and now it's expanding to a
[14:01.560 --> 14:08.000]  mega level. Kevin Trudeau who I met twice because I wanted to see who he
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.920]  really was is a con artist undoubtedly and he's been sentenced to 10 years in
[14:12.920 --> 14:19.040]  prison last night not so much for his infomercials but for refusing to change
[14:19.040 --> 14:24.440]  claims and violating court orders and I met him and he was undoubtedly full of
[14:24.440 --> 14:28.920]  prunes as Dan rather would say I went to dinner with him once and I said did you
[14:28.920 --> 14:33.040]  really go to area 51 and see space aliens as he wrote on his books he looked
[14:33.040 --> 14:36.400]  at me point blank and said yes I did see the space aliens and I said I think
[14:36.400 --> 14:40.040]  we're done with dinner and that no I'm not going to be interviewing you anymore
[14:40.040 --> 14:44.800]  than everybody twice and I said I you know I support the First Amendment but I
[14:44.800 --> 14:48.600]  do not support what you're doing with it so that means I'm not going to support
[14:48.600 --> 14:52.440]  you and he would send me Christmas cards and things like that you know
[14:52.440 --> 14:59.600]  thereafter I'm not throwing him under the bus the point is how is he going to
[14:59.600 --> 15:08.120]  prison for fat diets that I looked at and quite frankly if you actually followed
[15:08.120 --> 15:12.520]  it I think you would lose weight you know he said natural cures they don't
[15:12.520 --> 15:15.840]  want you to know about I don't know if they're cures but certainly it's been
[15:15.840 --> 15:19.800]  proven that mass dosages of vitamin C Linus Pauling won the Pulitzer at the
[15:19.800 --> 15:24.640]  Pulitzer the Nobel Prize for it twice but one of them was for that finding it
[15:24.640 --> 15:33.360]  can really reduce cancer I mean you need to go to prison for 10 years for that
[15:34.720 --> 15:40.120]  see they can go put him in jail and make themselves look good like in Scarface
[15:40.120 --> 15:43.280]  where he says you need me to be the bad man so you can point your finger and go
[15:43.280 --> 15:47.240]  there's the bad man when the truth is it's the banks and the system that have
[15:47.240 --> 15:50.840]  been running all for thousands of years and you guys are the real criminals but
[15:50.840 --> 15:56.200]  you need me to point your finger at and say there's the bad man and that is
[15:56.200 --> 16:01.080]  exactly what's going on here Martha Stewart did nothing and they put her in
[16:01.080 --> 16:08.040]  prison Kevin Trudeau I didn't really know Kevin Trudeau as I've seen his
[16:08.040 --> 16:11.760]  infomercials and thought they were pretty reasonable about you know St. John's
[16:11.760 --> 16:14.920]  warts good for depression I've seen the mainline studies on that
[16:14.920 --> 16:20.960]  Adam and C's good for not getting cancer everybody knows that but then I discovered
[16:20.960 --> 16:23.280]  over the years after I had him on a couple times people sent me all the
[16:23.280 --> 16:27.640]  info you know in this book he says he met with aliens went and looked at it
[16:27.640 --> 16:31.000]  really said that did you know over here you know he mails out these letters
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  saying join this group and we'll send you a bunch of you know tips on how to join
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.680]  the Illuminati I'm sure enough I was like whoa this is incredible but my point
[16:38.680 --> 16:45.280]  is Kevin Trudeau compared to Obama and the globalist and and in Rahm Emanuel's
[16:45.280 --> 16:48.160]  brother that helped write the bills saying oh we want to direct health care
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.280]  on Fox that is our plan the insurance companies know that and they want to be
[16:53.280 --> 16:57.280]  on the team in the future where they're gonna administer the single payer where
[16:57.280 --> 17:03.440]  you've got to pay what whatever they say that's the opposite of socialism that is
[17:03.440 --> 17:07.760]  foreign offshore corporations taxing us directly as the Supreme Court ruled on
[17:07.760 --> 17:14.360]  Obamacare so it really gets stuck in my craw a bar in my
[17:14.360 --> 17:23.440]  shadow a grain of sand in my Easter that the mass crime is going on cancer

[24:36.560 --> 24:41.640]  Jamie Foxx in faked Russian uniform on Twitter crowdhammers take Obama is
[24:41.640 --> 24:44.800]  being ridiculed by Russians I'll tell you what I think about that I don't agree
[24:44.800 --> 24:51.480]  with that Putin says us guided by the rule of the gun in foreign policy Biden
[24:51.480 --> 24:58.200]  in Europe to reassure allies over Russia's move in Ukraine Obama says

[25:22.320 --> 25:27.080]  in the next segment also we're gonna get into how this ties together with
[25:27.080 --> 25:31.160]  Israel's defense chief says the US is projecting weakness that that is not
[25:31.160 --> 25:36.760]  what's happening and it's like a way to snipe at Obama to claim he's weak
[25:36.760 --> 25:42.320]  they're not weak they're incredibly evil like a case of brain cancer and are
[25:42.320 --> 25:47.800]  taking over the planet right now as Obama is just a figurehead he has to be
[25:47.800 --> 25:53.240]  brought down politically because because he is the slogan the idea of making
[25:53.240 --> 25:59.760]  tyranny and global empire trending so I'm gonna break down what's really going
[25:59.760 --> 26:03.080]  on from my perspective which I'm trying to brag here I'm just telling you my
[26:03.080 --> 26:07.040]  perspective is accurate on this this is this is the globalist system it's not my
[26:07.040 --> 26:11.760]  opinion on what's happening here up on info wars.com some of the
[26:11.760 --> 26:15.840]  other news by the way this already scrolled off info wars.com from last
[26:15.840 --> 26:19.640]  night so much of our best stuff goes up in the evening I never get to it will
[26:19.640 --> 26:22.200]  you guys print me because I didn't see it in stacks probably here I probably
[26:22.200 --> 26:28.760]  missed it I got here late today will you guys pull me the article about the
[26:28.760 --> 26:32.280]  professor that wants to arrest anyone that denies global warming and doesn't
[26:32.280 --> 26:36.440]  want to pay Al Gore money drudge report.com still has it up I appreciate
[26:36.440 --> 26:41.320]  drudge report.com carrying that I'd like to carry that here on my own show I'd
[26:41.320 --> 26:48.160]  like to cover that coming up as well it's in my stack I missed that stack well
[26:48.160 --> 26:54.120]  I'll find it the point is we're gonna be getting to that too ATF agent says
[26:54.120 --> 26:59.680]  raiding gun store was fine that's up on info wars.com very disgusting article
[26:59.680 --> 27:07.080]  we're gonna be covering again we're going to get into what's also happening
[27:07.080 --> 27:10.200]  with what will happen when the big one hits California I've got to cover that
[27:10.200 --> 27:15.080]  earthquake article by Michael Snyder that's excellent and a lot more is up on
[27:15.080 --> 27:22.640]  info wars.com we're also going to get to this report out of the washington post.com
[27:22.640 --> 27:25.920]  I've told you this for a long time because it was in the telecommunications act
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.800]  of 96 again I'm not I'm not imagining this and then and then just being right
[27:30.800 --> 27:37.000]  over and over again I'd love to be psychic but we're all intuitive and have
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.040]  a sixth sense to a certain degree but not to this level NSA surveillance program
[27:41.040 --> 27:45.240]  reaches into the past retrieve and replay phone calls and then buried in
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.560]  the article the headline should be NSA records every phone call and saves them
[27:49.560 --> 27:53.640]  forever that's why I like drudge report.com because in the article in the
[27:53.640 --> 27:57.080]  washington post they admit that later in the article that should be the
[27:57.080 --> 28:03.760]  headline what did drudge headline it NSA recorded every single call in the
[28:03.760 --> 28:11.680]  country you understand that's how they operate and it's not just a giant
[28:11.680 --> 28:16.080]  screw job it's not just use for political and economic control by select
[28:16.080 --> 28:22.240]  interest unfairly and the ultimate form of discrimination it also cost they
[28:22.240 --> 28:30.120]  estimate a hundred billion dollars a year and then you've got the defense
[28:30.120 --> 28:33.240]  budget at 600 plus billion and supplemental 400 million it's like a
[28:33.240 --> 28:40.920]  trillion plus dollars if you look at all the different budgets together it
[28:40.920 --> 28:45.840]  just keeps expanding and getting bigger and bigger then you got all the black
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.400]  budgets together I mean it is just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[28:49.400 --> 28:52.600]  hundreds and hundreds of dollars in fact no one really knows that's why CBS
[28:52.600 --> 28:59.280]  news reported back in September 10th 2001 look it up that 2.2 trillion was
[28:59.280 --> 29:04.440]  missing from the Pentagon and no one knows where it went 2.2 trillion last
[29:04.440 --> 29:07.600]  time I checked it was like 5 trillion now missing no one knows where it's gone

[33:34.600 --> 33:40.040]  sell impoverishing the poorest Americans and working-class people to the
[33:40.040 --> 33:42.880]  greatest extent this nation has probably ever seen
[33:42.880 --> 33:47.880]  Obamacare on record raises seven taxes on people making below thirty thousand
[33:47.880 --> 33:53.160]  dollars a year and many of you out there that are working-class folks with all
[33:53.160 --> 33:58.200]  the fines fees and regulations that are going bankrupt right now you are now
[33:58.200 --> 34:02.880]  experiencing the fraud that is the plan to bankrupt this country and force you
[34:02.880 --> 34:06.800]  on to welfare as a supplemental income the White House has said and they're
[34:06.800 --> 34:10.800]  telling employers under Obamacare you're being cut from 40 hours to less than 30
[34:10.800 --> 34:15.680]  under Obamacare you're still not exempt you've got to pay for it all you've got
[34:15.680 --> 34:18.920]  to get off that older plan that was affordable suddenly it's unaffordable
[34:18.920 --> 34:24.980]  that's okay go on Medicare go on Medicaid that's okay here are government
[34:24.980 --> 34:28.920]  issued guidelines that the Department of Health and Human Services is putting
[34:28.920 --> 34:33.760]  out in the last three years telling you how to go get on food stamps and get your
[34:33.760 --> 34:40.200]  card your government card and people who's for generations have never gone on
[34:40.200 --> 34:44.880]  welfare might have gone on employment sometimes when they were out of work
[34:44.880 --> 34:53.280]  factories are shut down the other jobs are disappearing the service jobs being
[34:53.280 --> 34:57.040]  undercut being replaced by foreign workers and so you go in and you get
[34:57.040 --> 35:01.120]  your welfare card and they go psychological evaluation comes with
[35:01.120 --> 35:04.240]  this go to our government psychologist we say you're mentally ill go on these
[35:04.240 --> 35:07.880]  drugs we're taking your welfare now we're gonna take your guns now we're
[35:07.880 --> 35:13.040]  gonna take your kids this is the domestication process this is slavery
[35:13.040 --> 35:19.880]  this is how they militarily through economics in a economic war of
[35:19.880 --> 35:24.160]  sanctions against the American people that's all this is is economic siege
[35:24.160 --> 35:27.960]  bring this country down and they said the only hope they've got to get Obamacare
[35:27.960 --> 35:31.520]  through is to have all the movie stars and Hollywood people and sports icons
[35:31.520 --> 35:38.640]  like LeBron James who just broke the 60 baskets in a game record oh my gosh it's
[35:38.640 --> 35:46.080]  so incredible it's so amazing we better go sign up even though it's just so the
[35:46.080 --> 35:50.720]  IRS can track us and rob our bank account I'm gonna do it cuz LeBron said
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.800]  someone look Obama smiles at him and it's okay they stick a knife in your
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.520]  stomach it's okay cuz they're smiling and it's about it's about winning and
[36:00.520 --> 36:04.560]  they're targeting black folks you know hey president's black LeBron's black a
[36:04.560 --> 36:09.760]  lot of pride in these folks get on the site and sign up come on we're gonna
[36:09.760 --> 36:13.440]  build more abortion clinics and get state funding for that as well we're
[36:13.440 --> 36:17.600]  gonna kill all the black people it's so liberal
[36:18.480 --> 36:26.240]  doesn't matter cuz LeBron's got a nice smile and the media says that it's all
[36:26.240 --> 36:36.040]  that matters and so we've got to do what LeBron says Jamie Fox said it he's our
[36:36.040 --> 36:40.320]  Lord and Savior that we should find that clip again he's our Lord and Savior
[36:40.320 --> 36:45.640]  Barack Obama doesn't matter he works for foreign banks doesn't matter the
[36:45.640 --> 36:50.240]  country's being totally destroyed doesn't matter we're being completely shut
[36:50.240 --> 36:55.840]  down because all that matters are sports in Hollywood and that's all the
[36:55.840 --> 36:59.200]  average American knows so you're gonna be enslaved but you're so dumb you won't
[36:59.200 --> 37:02.160]  even know you're being enslaved you're just like LeBron the average America's
[37:02.160 --> 37:07.080]  just like LeBron narcissistic childlike smile like they're five dressed up like
[37:07.080 --> 37:11.280]  Batman at their birthday party and you know or they're the five-year-old
[37:11.280 --> 37:14.040]  getting a ride with the cops because they won in the war I saw that in the
[37:14.040 --> 37:18.160]  news to you know to be Batman and the kids look so proud of that same
[37:18.160 --> 37:22.640]  narcissistic glow in their eye a kid's supposed to be narcissistic to create
[37:22.640 --> 37:27.400]  their own identity self-actuate become their own person but as you become
[37:27.400 --> 37:31.440]  older you're supposed to become less narcissistic and more about humanity and
[37:31.440 --> 37:37.280]  in building systems and being honorable you're still an individual but it is more
[37:37.280 --> 37:42.600]  the larger honor system of being part of honorable men and women throughout
[37:42.600 --> 37:48.560]  history that is really the paramount room that you enter it is the dark tower
[37:48.560 --> 37:53.680]  the child rolling the dark tower came there for a brief moment eliminated by
[37:53.680 --> 37:57.920]  the Sun going through the clouds you could see them all all the men this one
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.040]  was brave this one was fortunate this one was honorable in blazing and I knew
[38:02.040 --> 38:09.080]  them and they knew me dauntless lifted the slug horn to my lips in blue you
[38:09.080 --> 38:15.120]  never take that away the average man though I mean men I've read every
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.400]  culture's writings of every culture that had writings and that was always what a
[38:20.400 --> 38:25.740]  15 year old was really seeking for was to be honorable and to tell the truth and
[38:25.740 --> 38:29.000]  to be a man and to be like their ancestors and to honor their family
[38:29.000 --> 38:35.320]  name and to be strong 15 year olds if you were a man by 15 they three to the
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.000]  side in almost every culture you need to be a man by the time you were 12 13 14
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.600]  now they arrest your development and say oh you're not really a man until
[38:44.600 --> 38:49.440]  you're 25 now you're not really supposed to go out I mean all these young people
[38:49.440 --> 38:52.160]  tell me hey I know you're telling the truth but I'm young I want to have some
[38:52.160 --> 38:56.520]  fun first and then you're 30 35 40 I want to make money and have a family and
[38:56.520 --> 38:59.520]  then you're retired you want to travel you don't want to be involved you know
[38:59.520 --> 39:02.560]  I'm retired now Alex I don't want to be involved they've shed it all up like
[39:02.560 --> 39:05.760]  you're supposed to be selfish and of course you only worry about yourself and
[39:05.760 --> 39:09.360]  then you lose everything only worried about yourself and then those that
[39:09.360 --> 39:14.200]  understand that collectivism is real but it's individually actuated and
[39:14.200 --> 39:19.080]  activated by free association to build collectives of free will that are
[39:19.080 --> 39:23.560]  literally stairways to greater civilization and empowerment not false
[39:23.560 --> 39:28.040]  collectives imposed by those that wish to sabotage the true human potential
[39:28.040 --> 39:32.200]  by the way these are the great secrets of civilization humanity you're being
[39:32.200 --> 39:40.320]  given right now known by all cultures that thrived forgotten secrets that are
[39:40.320 --> 39:48.920]  simple but revolutionary that's why people in every old culture that was a
[39:48.920 --> 39:54.120]  thriving noble culture there were cultures that were not noble but noble
[39:54.120 --> 39:59.240]  cultures were known by their honor and the fact that like a bulldog they were
[39:59.240 --> 40:06.120]  bred to hold on and never release but to quote a man for all seasons I think a
[40:06.120 --> 40:16.960]  bitch got over the wall because a lot of you out there claim your bulldogs a lot
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.800]  of people out there claim you want liberty and the animating contest but
[40:21.800 --> 40:29.160]  you don't act like somebody who has the birthright of George Washington you
[40:29.160 --> 40:37.200]  don't act like somebody who has the birthright of Chuck Yeager you don't act
[40:37.200 --> 40:44.280]  like somebody who has the birthright of a Martin Luther King or a Beethoven or a
[40:44.280 --> 40:48.800]  Mahatma Gandhi or anybody else who stood for the empowerment of the
[40:48.800 --> 40:57.560]  individual and to see LeBron James who in the face has the shining reflection of
[40:57.560 --> 41:02.200]  a five-year-old at his surprise birthday party imagining that he's Superman or
[41:02.200 --> 41:06.760]  Batman I've seen that look in children I remember that look in my own eyes as a
[41:06.760 --> 41:14.680]  very young child I transcended delusion and narcissism at about age five I
[41:14.680 --> 41:18.640]  remember it at age three understanding at age five transcending that
[41:18.640 --> 41:23.920]  imagining I'm a king imagining I'm powerful imagining I'm dominant
[41:23.920 --> 41:29.600]  imagining is is a fraud and a lie and I could see it another children and and
[41:29.600 --> 41:35.080]  literally set back with the wisdom of an old man because of my genetics and my
[41:35.080 --> 41:40.520]  instincts that all of you have as well but accessing those I knew things that
[41:40.520 --> 41:45.920]  old men knew when I was a boy and then I look at people like LeBron James who is
[41:45.920 --> 41:52.160]  literally a child ladies and gentlemen it's very very sad selling liquid death
[41:52.160 --> 41:57.800]  and poison to people to go sign up because LeBron told him it's like using a
[41:57.800 --> 42:03.360]  puppy Obama is using LeBron James like a puppy and a bag of candy to get the
[42:03.360 --> 42:08.120]  child in the back of the white van to be taken to a torture center for 14
[42:08.120 --> 42:15.840]  snuff films to be produced but I don't blame the puppy but he is a dangerous
[42:15.840 --> 42:25.360]  puppy nevertheless LeBron James is a weapon system you have to understand
[42:25.360 --> 42:31.160]  folks that the globalist are your sworn enemy and you can step in to manhood
[42:31.160 --> 42:35.480]  step into your honor or you can be weak forever and that doesn't mean any of us
[42:35.480 --> 42:39.840]  are perfect all of us are dishonorable at one level or another but we seek to be
[42:39.840 --> 42:48.280]  honorable we know good from evil we know right from wrong that's why the enemy
[42:48.280 --> 42:51.320]  always seeks to discredit me and say I'm not real and say I'm dishonorable
[42:51.320 --> 42:56.120]  because they've been following me for 20 years and they know I'm honorable and
[42:56.120 --> 43:01.840]  have the blood of honor in me just as you do as well I'm nothing special I just
[43:01.840 --> 43:10.640]  accessed my basic primary operating system of being a man you can access it as
[43:10.640 --> 43:13.480]  well the hardware is there you don't even have to learn this ladies and
[43:13.480 --> 43:17.960]  gentlemen you have to access it you have to stop being insecure you have to stop
[43:17.960 --> 43:21.040]  caring what people think about you you have to stop worrying about what the
[43:21.040 --> 43:25.120]  world says because it's a fraud and you have to access your real human
[43:25.120 --> 43:33.080]  programming that God put in you you are stardust you are of the universe you're
[43:33.080 --> 43:37.600]  on a planet you want to go to space you want to travel you want to own see other
[43:37.600 --> 43:44.360]  worlds you're on a beautiful world you're part of something amazing you're on a
[43:44.360 --> 43:54.440]  fantastic forbidden planet you're on a world of wonder the mysteries of the
[43:54.440 --> 44:00.360]  universe spill out before you in the incredible transcendental experience of
[44:00.360 --> 44:04.960]  full-spectrum consciousness that the enemy wishes to overwrite I am not their
[44:04.960 --> 44:13.480]  robot slave I am not their biological replicant I am a man I am real and I am
[44:13.480 --> 44:19.440]  free and I seek justice from the foundations of the earth God wanted us
[44:19.440 --> 44:24.840]  to be free but we have to make the decision which side we serve the weak
[44:24.840 --> 44:30.480]  will serve evil because they believe it has power but it only has a reflection
[44:30.480 --> 44:36.280]  on its face of the universe but they stare into the reflection as the
[44:36.280 --> 44:47.920]  narcissist the reflection is not the reality the reflection is only a two
[44:47.920 --> 44:54.120]  dimensional facsimile just as their genetic research they only have a photo
[44:54.120 --> 44:57.800]  of the grizzly bear not the true genetics of the grizzly bear they only
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.600]  have a photo of the human genetics not the way it actually works not the real
[45:02.600 --> 45:09.480]  human just as the devil is a counterfeit of God and as a photograph of God and a
[45:09.480 --> 45:15.280]  distorted photograph at that God is the real power let's go to this clip breaking
[45:15.280 --> 45:19.120]  down the worship of sports with LeBron James from this piece we put out four
[45:19.120 --> 45:24.720]  five six years ago whenever he joined the Miami Heat here it is
[45:29.960 --> 45:36.200]  societies don't change whether it was the Roman Empire or Nazi Germany the
[45:36.200 --> 45:42.360]  population is obsessed with sports and petty celebrities and the United States
[45:42.360 --> 45:47.280]  is no different MSNBC the New York Times they're all reporting that we are
[45:47.280 --> 45:51.800]  going into a depression one of the greatest depressions in world history
[45:51.800 --> 45:56.400]  and our decadence slob like public and that's not everyone but large
[45:56.400 --> 46:00.480]  percentages of the public could care less they're not involved in their
[46:00.480 --> 46:05.840]  communities we've got 46 states on the verge of bankruptcy the government's
[46:05.840 --> 46:11.040]  raising taxes on every level the border with Mexico is collapsing Mexico has
[46:11.040 --> 46:15.680]  collapsed and the public doesn't care because the media has set the agenda and
[46:15.680 --> 46:20.760]  they tell you to care about LeBron James and his decision and he's playing into
[46:20.760 --> 46:24.960]  it and is going to announce his stupid decision it doesn't matter what basketball
[46:24.960 --> 46:31.240]  team he goes to this is a distraction by design we have the governor of the state
[46:31.240 --> 46:36.280]  he's currently living in in a bizarre we are LeBron we are the world literal
[46:36.280 --> 46:41.920]  worship fest with hundreds of celebrities this is sickening
[46:45.920 --> 46:53.720]  no bigger heart imagine the Ohio governor begging and pleading on
[46:53.720 --> 46:59.040]  television and serenading LeBron James with hundreds of other celebrities when
[46:59.040 --> 47:03.640]  Ohio is one of the states slated to go completely bankrupt we're going into a
[47:03.640 --> 47:09.080]  depression they're about to watch World War three with Iran openly Fox News is
[47:09.080 --> 47:14.560]  reporting as if it's a good thing in New York State in Illinois that troops have
[47:14.560 --> 47:18.760]  helped arrest thousands of citizens and are doing gun sweeps in people's homes
[47:18.760 --> 47:24.560]  and searching people's cars we're going in to martial law offshore banks have
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.320]  overthrown the US they've stolen tens of trillions of dollars like we're some
[47:28.320 --> 47:31.680]  third-world country they're looting everything's going to hell in a hand
[47:31.680 --> 47:34.880]  basket so if you want to know why your children have no future you want to know
[47:34.880 --> 47:37.880]  why you're bankrupt if you want to know why you're in debt if you want to know
[47:37.880 --> 47:42.560]  why you have no future and have lost your job or getting your pay cut it's
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.460]  because your priorities are wrong it's because you let that idiot box the
[47:47.460 --> 47:51.600]  television program use since the days that your mother and father set you in
[47:51.600 --> 47:55.920]  front of the TV for 12 hours a day in your crap filled diapers it's not too
[47:55.920 --> 48:01.080]  late to admit we're a sick decadent degenerate society crumbling we are
[48:01.080 --> 48:06.160]  Rome it's 410 we're about to collapse ladies and gentlemen I know you won't
[48:06.160 --> 48:09.640]  know you know about LeBron James you don't know 410 is when Rome completely
[48:09.640 --> 48:13.880]  fell to Alaric the Visigoth leader you better learn history this is dangerous
[48:13.880 --> 48:18.480]  don't say you weren't warned the globalist engineers the globalist social
[48:18.480 --> 48:23.040]  engineers look at you and how pathetic you are and how the whole world is
[48:23.040 --> 48:28.040]  waiting to see where LeBron James goes the social controllers look at you and
[48:28.040 --> 48:31.480]  see how you're obsessed with LeBron James and they decide we got a bunch of
[48:31.480 --> 48:35.480]  schmucks we've got a bunch of idiots we got a bunch of morons right where we
[48:35.480 --> 48:39.560]  want them let's destroy their society let's loot it let's pass carbon taxes
[48:39.560 --> 48:43.160]  let's expand NAFTA and GATT let's announce an end to the dollar is the
[48:43.160 --> 48:46.400]  global reserve currency you know what that means we've already lost almost all
[48:46.400 --> 48:49.280]  our industry we're already in a depression when they get rid of the
[48:49.280 --> 48:53.320]  dollar as the World Reserve currency your life as you know it is officially
[48:53.320 --> 48:56.600]  over you're going to be a third-world slave like they are in Mexico or
[48:56.600 --> 49:00.240]  Nigeria and you know what those people down there at least know why they're
[49:00.240 --> 49:04.320]  slaves you are so stupid and so focused on crap you'll probably still be
[49:04.320 --> 49:07.640]  talking about Lindsay Lohan when you're living as a homeless person on the
[49:07.640 --> 49:12.360]  street my friends we've got to set our priorities and set them now Liberty or
[49:12.360 --> 49:16.760]  tyranny you've got to wake up and decide what is important to you saving our
[49:16.760 --> 49:20.960]  republic stopping the globalist takeover or knowing all the mindless trivia
[49:20.960 --> 49:27.040]  about LeBron James and Lindsay Lohan there isn't much more time I'm begging
[49:27.040 --> 49:31.080]  you to ask yourselves to look in the mirror and really realize how sick this
[49:31.080 --> 49:34.880]  is all right it's not bad the full video is gonna be reposted info wars.com
[49:34.880 --> 49:40.080]  that's from almost four years ago back in 2010 and July I uploaded that hours
[49:40.080 --> 49:44.320]  before LeBron James made his decision after all the groveling in Ohio and
[49:44.320 --> 49:50.160]  Cleveland to go to Miami and I wanted to just recap how sick that is they
[49:50.160 --> 49:54.800]  build up what they want you to think is important the idols so you're worshiping
[49:54.800 --> 50:00.400]  stuff that doesn't matter Hollywood Justin Bieber all of this is your lord
[50:00.400 --> 50:06.000]  and savior while the globalists run the real world and we're in a depression
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.240]  according to almost every real economist we are continuing to see proxy wars the
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.760]  dollar devalued if things are getting worse but the average person feels like
[50:15.760 --> 50:19.200]  they're alone well I'm not doing too good but everybody else must be they keep

[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.600]  get your take on lebron james and all these movie stars and people being used
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.560]  to push obama care people need to reach out to their managers and to reach out
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.240]  to them at games or on the street if you see them any of the idiots promoting
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.160]  this and say look it it taxes payrolls of poor people
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.120]  obama broke that promise to not raise taxes on anybody
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.880]  making less than a quarter million a year it cuts hours from 40 to less than
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.520]  30 for most people it doubles triples quadruple prices
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.480]  it's got death panels kicks you off pre-existing conditions
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.600]  and raises six other taxes on top of that one on poor people
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.120]  i mean this this thing is meant to blow our engine out and make people go on
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.880]  welfare and and you look the one reason i have a
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:17.280]  problem with sports people is that when i was growing up sports folks were not
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.560]  as arrogant as they are now and people that were successful it was all about
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:25.600]  not being arrogant and man i i i got to tell you living in austin i run
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.840]  into ut football players i run into uh professional
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:35.200]  folks and they are just mentally ill arrogant people walk walking pit bulls
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.360]  downtown and bumping into people like their god and just
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:44.480]  just just as a whole sports people act like a bunch of narcissistic mentally
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.560]  ill twits because they've been told by the
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.960]  brainwashing system they're god so other people think oh the emperor is
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.600]  wearing beautiful clothes well really they're butt naked but
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.320]  you don't want to admit that you know you don't see how beautiful and
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.960]  wonderful it all is so you just get obsessed with it
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.680]  and then meanwhile the globalists take over the whole planet while you're
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.120]  obsessed with angelina joe lee telling you the un's gonna save you or
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.680]  lebron james saying shine up for um
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.040]  you know obama care and they've got all these yellow ribbon programs want to
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.480]  give money for breast cancer want to give money for this want to jog in a
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.880]  you know 10k for breast cancer hey i'll give money
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.560]  to to a program discovering why breast cancer is up multi thousand percentage
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.880]  points and why the us and europe lead it worldwide
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:39.040]  i will give money uh to find out uh why infertilities exploding not not
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:42.000]  again it'd be like if suddenly where i live in austin texas we broadcast
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.760]  worldwide or let's say you live in dallas or
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.960]  london or new york or wherever if a hundred people are getting shot
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.160]  last time i checked like a hundred people are dying in all of new york with
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.040]  10 20 million people whatever it is you know every week or two from breast
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.560]  cancer if every week or so
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.760]  a hundred people were being shot dead
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.080]  randomly in the greater new york city area
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.200]  what is it like 10 million in manhattan you can all the other boroughs it's like
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.120]  20 million or something that would be big news and it wouldn't be we're trying
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.720]  to find a cure to the 44 magnum that is being
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:24.240]  fired into people's heads in brooklyn and in manhattan
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.880]  and in harlem and in queens
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:37.120]  it would be who is shooting the people wouldn't be let's find a cure
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.560]  to serious gunshot trauma to the head
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.240]  but that's the crazy logic so i'm at walgreens getting something
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.960]  it's like to get money for breast cancer no why not
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.280]  because i know what's doing it it's life a
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.560]  state in the water table that literally grows
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:04.480]  breast tumors on record they admit that so we don't even need money to find out
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.960]  what's doing it that in estrogen other estrogen
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.400]  mimicers and the birth control in the water from the runoff and they added as
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.360]  well ap did a study i was six seven years ago of major cities and found
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.960]  we don't know why there's levels of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.000]  things in the water that you know in some cases
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.040]  there's a hundred plus times what it should be even from runoff
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.960]  it's being added dumbo
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:36.000]  it's not just running off of course they're adding it to the water
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.160]  they're adding it all look at the general public going completely mentally ill
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.320]  right now the average so-called fluoride they add is
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:50.720]  grignard reagent toxic waste from aluminum smelting and fertilizer
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:57.920]  processing from from mines they mine the stuff for the it's in limestone mines
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.720]  places like florida in places it's got uranium in it as well
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.360]  it's got uranium that's where they mine the uranium it's the same place they
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:09.280]  get the fertilizer and they just put it in your water lovingly
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.000]  so i'd like to hear from you on that subject i'm kind of digressing i got a
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.320]  bunch of news to get to on russia the point is is that we know why all this
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:21.120]  is happening we know why all this is going on
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.720]  and it's being done by design i mean i'm gonna explain that again
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:29.440]  life of states have been rolled out round up you name it to be used
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:35.440]  at a ubiquitous level it's everywhere and
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.560]  i'm here to tell you what's going on and you can go check it out for yourself in
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.120]  five seconds if i'm telling you the truth so see i'm not here like everybody
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.320]  else to try to keep the problem going and then set
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.400]  up industries off of the problem
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.600]  i'm here to try to end the problem because see i have three children
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.640]  and that's what i care about and i want you to succeed be successful
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.080]  the globalists do not they're in competition with a strong
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.960]  society a strong male driven society a patriarchal
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.760]  society they're they're threatened by a real americana
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.280]  they're threatened by 1776 that will empower women and everybody else
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.680]  they're threatened by individualism they're threatened by normal healthy
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.880]  societies because they'll be dominant and they'll explode the globalists have
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.240]  already dominated the world they want to shut down anything
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.280]  that could ever reverse that so here's the headline breast cancer survivors
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:37.360]  told to remove pink ribbon in home
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:41.920]  16 year old linda karp breast cancer beat breast cancer
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:47.440]  16 year old or 16 years ago excuse me and she has been doing her part to keep
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.120]  the disease in the public eye so as a pride that she put a large pink
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.560]  ribbon inside her home for three years but not everybody was happy karp was
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.360]  shocked when she received a letter from the homeowner's association remove the
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.920]  ribbon you know homeowner's associations most of them aren't that bad
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.480]  that i've experienced but some of them get power freaks involved
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.200]  to enjoy dominating everyone and they'll do this kind of stuff they say we don't
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.200]  want to see that out your window you know through your window
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.800]  but but again why not have a ribbon that says we know the new world order is
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.880]  killing us we know the government's poisoning us we know
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.320]  there's a eugenics operation we need to come up with some symbolism like that
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.360]  and then we can all just identify maybe an upside down flag
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.880]  that in the white stripes has little messages
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.200]  that says there is a program to poison the population there is a program to
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.640]  impoverish the population there is a program to destroy the family
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.480]  there is a program to bring in world government and it's run by the large
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.400]  central banks like the federal reserve here in the united states
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.480]  and until we identify that enemy we have no future
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.920]  america and the world is occupied by the new world order
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:04.240]  they are the enemy discover the enemy or perish
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.400]  and you stick the upside down flag on everything and people go up and read
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.520]  what's in the messages and then others can add what they think the problem is
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.160]  in the emergency message and then that can spread there
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:18.320]  if you go out and do it it'll be a great victory against the enemy
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:27.840]  will it bring them down no but the act of resistance and truth will
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.880]  you need to understand ladies and gentlemen this is serious
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:36.640]  and we need to combat it at every level all right let me get into the situation
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.680]  in russia the toll free number is 800
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:47.120]  2599231 800 2599231 and when i go to you at the
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.280]  bottom of the hour i'm not going to make you sit there and hold i'm going to go to
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:54.400]  you in fact john harman this is an order
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.840]  you are just today as a test to fade me down if i try to talk
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.880]  during a 60 second period we will let the person talk for 60 seconds and they
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.440]  will be hung up on regardless of how important their
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.160]  information is that's how we'll get to a bunch of calls
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.960]  so it's good and then i will have 15 seconds to respond
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:20.800]  and we'll move to the next person this will be a day long remembered
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.440]  all right
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.360]  let's go ahead and get into the russia situation
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.080]  well here's the arrogant mobster criminal uh joe biden
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.600]  russia is alone naked in front of the entire world
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:42.320]  no you are you criminal leech there's another one biden in europe
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.760]  to reassure our allies over russia's moves in ukraine
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.800]  washington post folks folks russia took less than 10 of the country that
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.040]  historically has been part of russia i know you know that
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.720]  i know you know that but notice the hoax calling the media calling
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.400]  obama week and the neocons calling obama week the globalist with neocon
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.480]  help and nato help just took 90 plus percent of the country and put their
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.680]  regime that will now join the eu for looting
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.560]  they voted not to join the eu now they're going to have a marshal plan
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:19.200]  emergency aid signing them on to the debt the eu just took
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.720]  90 plus percent of the country russia came into grab their bases and gas
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:26.560]  pipelines and they're calling it a victory for putin
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.360]  so he can then strut around in his gold palace when in truth this is a major
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.720]  defeat for russia that's spin for you and then israel and the
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.560]  neocons give right-wing support and cover to obama who's on the exact same
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.800]  team
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.560]  that's the rest of the story good day
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.640]  we're going to skip this network break this is too important i've got to cover
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.320]  the story now ron paul i'm going to read this whole article out of u.s.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.680]  today because it says it all very measured very reasonable what i've been
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:01.040]  saying for weeks
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.000]  in u.s.a. today ron paul Crimea secedes so what residents of Crimea voted over
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.800]  the weekend whether they would remain an autonomous
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.680]  region the ukraine or join the russian federation in doing so
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.200]  they joined a number of countries and regions including recently scotland
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:19.360]  catalonia and venice they are seeking to secede from what they view
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:22.720]  as an unresponsive or repressive governments
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:29.040]  by 96.77 percent the latter three are proceeding without much notice
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.640]  while overwhelmingly Crimea vote to secede from ukraine
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.000]  has incensed the u.s. and european union officials who are run by
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.400]  globalist banks i should add and has led NATO closer to conflict with Russia
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:46.880]  in any time since the height of the cold war what's the big deal
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.480]  ron paul goes on to say opponents of the Crimea vote like
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.320]  to point to the legality of the referendum but self-determination is a
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:58.880]  centerpiece of international law article one of the united nations charter
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.200]  points out clearly that the purpose of the un is to develop friendly relations
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:07.440]  among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.080]  and self-determination of peoples why does the u.s care
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:15.520]  which flag will be hoisted on a small piece of land
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.040]  thousands of miles away it's eight thousand miles away technically
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.800]  critics point to the russian occupation of Crimea
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.200]  as evidence that no fair vote could have taken place
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:31.280]  where were these people when an election held in iraq occupied by u.s
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.640]  troops was called a triumph of democracy
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.920]  perhaps the u.s officials who supported the unconstitutional overthrow of
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.880]  ukraine's government should refocus their energies
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.520]  on learning our own constitution which does not allow
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.400]  the government to overthrow governments overseas
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.360]  or spend a billion dollars to bail out ukraine
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.840]  and its international creditors though the obama administration
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.600]  applied some minimal sanctions on selected russian and crummy and
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.800]  individuals either the u.s or the eu can afford significant
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.880]  sanctions against russia global trade provides too much economic benefit to
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.720]  both sides indeed paul continued to wrote
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.000]  international markets rallied on news that the sanctions
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  would be thus far minimal they understand that trade and economic
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.680]  engagement are the surest roads to peace and prosperity
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.280]  let's hope governments will follow their
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.640]  lead from the ron paul institute stories also at info wars dot com we carry
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:38.480]  all the ron paul's institute information most of it now
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.880]  how do you spend that we cannot believe how weak obama is
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.320]  he only backed taking over 90 plus percent of the country
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:49.360]  and seizing it and firebombing the police stations
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.480]  and shooting people and overthrowing elected government
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:56.720]  and uh i mean how dare obama be weak on syria over the last three years
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.360]  blowing up hundreds and hundreds of churches every month
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:03.680]  murdering christians and others in mass funding al-qaeda 200 000 strong to
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.640]  attack the country and now we want an air force bombardment

[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:55.280]  how dare him uh just absolutely
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:00.800]  sign on to a billion dollars in aid that'll be used for the military
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.480]  how dare him back nato arming ukrainian troops
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.880]  mashing in ukraine right now in ukraine refusing to leave
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.360]  saying quote they will battle the russians for it

[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.840]  running around jumping up and down saying he's weak
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.840]  and then it's like some kind of you know we're scoring when crowd hammer who

[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.040]  alex yeah they they want to cut taxes down to

[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.600]  i mean they well she didn't know that i've been accused in literally hundreds
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.040]  of publications being a kgb agent of course back when i said that our
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.080]  government was funding al qaeda they had the media claim that i'm a al qaeda
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.960]  sleeper cell person oh yes yes yes i that's why
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.080]  there is something the establishment does get though and i've been told this
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.040]  you know what's in some high-level meetings they've actually done their
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.320]  homework they do this on anybody you know just until
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.760]  about 50 years ago and this is probably discriminatory and a bad thing
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.680]  but back when america really was run by americans you couldn't get a high-level
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.720]  position unless your family been here back in 1776
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.160]  that's kind of inclusive a little bit elitist didn't it
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.520]  of all but but if you i could go be part of the societies
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:13.360]  with the elites that were in you know from the mayflower i could go be part of
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.320]  the uh you know sons of the republic of texas my mom could be
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.160]  daughters of the public of texas grandmothers

[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.240]  will stomp you into the ground do you understand that
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.320]  i want this country to survive i love this country i believe in this country
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.880]  we were exceptional and i'm sick of people signing us on to the new world
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.560]  order to world government destroying our industry destroying our country
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.320]  poisoning our people chemically and culturally
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:20.320]  and then you have got the nerve to sit up here
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:25.200]  and tell me that i'm not an american you're not an american you're a piece of
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.120]  trash sold out to the new world order the neocons
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.640]  the democratic party all of you are enemies enemies you want to usurp me

[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.280]  and trot them underfoot well i'm not going to sit here
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:44.960]  and i'm not going to put up with it and that's what it comes down to
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:48.480]  i am the rightful heir you are the rightful heir we are the rightful
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.440]  heirs of this republic and i don't care if you just got off a
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.320]  boat here if you like the bill of rights and constitution
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:58.320]  you like freedom you don't want handouts you don't want to be a slave you want
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.280]  guns you want to raise your own children you don't want to abort 53 million
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.800]  54 million babies then you are my brother i don't care what color you are
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:14.880]  or where you're from you want freedom then you're on the same side as i am
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.640]  but if you want to be part of gangs and inside scams and all this crud you're an
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.240]  enemy but i do see the russians surrounded
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.840]  and i do see them being bullied and pushed around and i see a sovereign
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.960]  country just like america under new world order attack
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.560]  and i do have solidarity with the russians at that level
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.000]  because they're being attacked by the same pack of wolves that already pulled us
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.960]  down and is eating our guts right now and they're trying to pull russia down
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.800]  right now they had russia down for 70 plus years
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.720]  absolutely murdering those people by the tens of millions
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.000]  and now they want to do that here you absolutely better believe
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.560]  i'm on fire to not see russia overrun by the new world order
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:00.560]  and destroy russia's trying to rebuild itself economically
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:07.600]  as ron paul said at the end of his article
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.760]  he says instead international markets rallied on news that these sanctions
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.560]  would be thus far minimal they understand that trade and economic
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.000]  engagement are the surest roads to peace and prosperity let's hope
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  governments will follow their lead
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:28.480]  i want to compete on ideas and products and if we beat the russians in
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:32.480]  competition great you want to have competitions and see american companies
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:36.400]  in america win contracts that's great then russians will buy our products
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.400]  and vice versa i don't want to be successful
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:49.280]  in the old ancient barbarian fraudulent imperial way of just making people
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.680]  slaves i want to be successful by true
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:58.720]  competition and true free will and that's what i stand for
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:02.800]  and that's what will build our civilization and give us a future
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.400]  we have been overrun by the most dishonorable anti-liberty
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.880]  anti-human gangs the world could ever imagine and we are in deep
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:15.200]  deep bondage and we are losing our genetics they are wrecking
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:19.520]  human genetics at many levels in an irreversible way that's on record
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.720]  we are being vandalized we are being attacked the globalists are the ultimate
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:30.800]  criminals to dare attack the virtuous
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:34.640]  that's where i stand excuse me for saying i'll kick people's butt it's just a
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:39.360]  certain point you know i dare one of these media

[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.880]  i genuinely get mad on air people ask me all the time is that an act
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:05.280]  and i think it could be an act as far as i let myself get angry
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.760]  but most of the time there isn't even one percent of acting in what i'm doing
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.680]  i'm sitting around acting silly it's it's it's me having fun
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:16.560]  but i was telling the story about the dallas cops
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.280]  being ordered to not let us demonstrate peacefully on a sidewalk
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.040]  and how i blew up at them and got mad at them
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.840]  and how i probably shouldn't have gotten that mad but they were robbing us of
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.400]  our birthright and i started getting mad
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:38.080]  because it was coming back to me just how pathetic this is
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.360]  it's the same thing we're overrun by the globalists they're they're destroying
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.920]  the country
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.200]  and they're bringing us into something really horrible it's not like we're
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:51.920]  being conquered by you know the greeks or something
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:57.360]  and we're some you know group living in squalor our life's about to get better
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.040]  2,500 years ago or whatever
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.960]  we're being conquered by the eugenicist new world order
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.560]  who absolutely plan to kill us
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:14.400]  james bond do you expect me to talk goldfinger no mr bond i expect you to die
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.160]  there's no quarter there's no games there's no
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:22.080]  and that's what's so frustrating about all this
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:28.320]  is that i really know i'm telling the truth i really know what the stakes are
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:35.200]  it's a twilight zone episode it should be a no-brainer to get out of this
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.320]  folks we just have to admit how much trouble we're in
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:46.240]  i mean i read these quotes here where obama is you know saying okay pull out of
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:50.080]  cramia or that's it they're still saying that that's in
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.600]  the hill obama says putin at breaking point
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:57.200]  got another one here out of i'm trying to find it out of
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.160]  bloomberg where he says all right i'm giving another ultimatum
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.240]  here it is obama says putin must pull back on cramia annexation
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.200]  i mean it's not happening
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.480]  romney calls it the price of failed leadership
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.200]  because he brought up ukraine and uh obama said that you know that wasn't
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.320]  going to be an issue well i mean they all knew that they were planning
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.000]  back in 97 under brazinski to launch an attack to take over most of the country
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  they predicted the russians would grab cramia that's the default position
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.440]  to grab something that's already been part of russia
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:35.040]  so again they did act on cramia they grabbed 90 plus percent
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.320]  of the country of ukraine
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.520]  and they that's romney and them giving obama right cover
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:46.320]  remember remember romney helped write obama care and got it passed in
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:52.640]  massachusetts the same screw job model that's why we're in so much
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.200]  trouble that's why we've got to take over the republican party
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.040]  and the democratic party and that could happen if people started realizing
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:03.120]  just how evil these two parties are people say well just create a new party
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.240]  they've already rigged everything you want to take these parties over
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:10.160]  and believe me it can be done with our ideas because our ideas are so much
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:12.800]  more popular than what the globalists are selling and pushing
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:17.360]  now finally this transmission is listener supported
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:21.280]  and we have come out with a fourth product at info wars life
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.000]  dot com i guess a fifth if you count the great organic coffee
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.760]  from southern mexico that's my favorite blend personally that we've put out
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:30.880]  directly buying it from the chiapas farmers there in the high mountains
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:33.760]  volcanic soil the wake of america we got two different blends
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:37.280]  and all your purchases for the broadcast we now have what i dubbed the
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.040]  silver bullet and to put it this way we could have got
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:44.240]  colloidal silver a million places and private labeled it it took us about
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.520]  eight months to finally get this we got a limited amount more is going to be
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.640]  coming in but it is selling out very very quickly
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.800]  silver bullet is the strongest colloidal silver
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:58.960]  and one of the smallest nano-sized particles and that's what they say you
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:04.000]  want really small and the place made us the biggest batch they've ever produced
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.720]  uh and they said that uh well they sent us the test
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.520]  it it it is silver bullet consult your physician before you use it
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:17.200]  uh i wish i would have had something this strong back when i had strep throat
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:21.040]  a few weeks ago and didn't know what i was taking silver and it did finally
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:26.320]  knock it out but it was uh extremely painful uh this stuff is strong but i'm
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.040]  going to tell you again consult your physician because you use too much silver
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.240]  their side effects you get to drink you know a lot of it you know
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:35.200]  they say people some people go crazy and drink hundreds of bottles a year of it
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.480]  and their skin turns blue you will literally turn into a gamelon
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:42.000]  you know star blazers the animated cartoon from the 80s where the gamelons

[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.080]  ahead hi alex uh long-time listener and second
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:12.240]  time caller you'd asked earlier about what we could use as a unifying symbol
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:15.840]  for unity and uh i want to announce operation
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.360]  take back where every american that is awake
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.440]  should be showing a flag in front of their home or
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.040]  business as a sign that the constitution is the united
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:30.800]  is the ultimate law of the land and if you are awake
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.240]  we should have our uh turn your porch light
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:38.560]  on and go around your neighborhood see who's awake who isn't awake what we
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.200]  need to do is we need to be talking to our neighbors
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:46.400]  and those that are not awake yet we need to wake them up we need to get out
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:49.520]  there and we need to take neighborhood by
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:53.440]  neighborhood city but i said total genius i agree with you
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:56.480]  we need to canvas our neighborhoods identify who's awake
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:00.400]  then organize to then try to wake the others up and their strength in numbers
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:03.920]  your neighbors are ready to wake up people are ready for freedom
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:07.200]  you've just got to set the brush fires in your area
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.920]  absolutely great idea thank you robert let's talk to jerry in georgia then we're
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.160]  going to el salvador in thailand jerry in georgia you're on the year

[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:27.120]  since january there's been a tritium leak
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:32.160]  into the water system you'll find dozens and dozens of little local news
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:38.000]  articles about it but nothing national and nothing about the the journalists
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.480]  don't go they don't test it but the dhc you've got articles where they
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.480]  admit there is a is a leak from from the bar well
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:51.840]  dumps facility into the groundwater and nobody and again that's a tritium leak
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:54.560]  that's not too healthy of course handculture says it's
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:57.280]  good for us so maybe maybe she can waver magic wand and
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:00.800]  and it'll save us but say that again what do you search because i hadn't

[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:21.920]  hey alex uh actually just wanted to talk about the malaysian
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.000]  uh flight that's been missing for a few days um it's just kind of
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.760]  it's been saying to me that the american people and anybody else who's been
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:32.960]  keeping up with the story can actually believe
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.600]  that it's missing that i mean how how do you lose a plane with
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:41.360]  however many people 239 people on board with all
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:45.040]  cell phones you know supposedly they track cell phones and
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:48.000]  they can figure out where people are and look at you through your camera and
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.480]  they can't find a whole bunch of people supposedly three americans on board
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.160]  i mean it's just like what is it what exactly does sound like a giant stunt to
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:00.640]  distract us from stuff happening in ukraine other areas
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.920]  and uh and that's another thing and uh and in ukraine
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.520]  what is this the beginning of world war three with russia and ukraine and
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:10.240]  it's definitely the beginning of a new cold war brother i appreciate your
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:12.480]  call or moving quick thanks for the call from

[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:28.240]  yeah thanks a lot for that um hey just wanted to give you a show tip um
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:31.360]  i don't know if you're aware of this i'm an options trader and i pay attention
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.600]  to these things but uh george sorov had taken out a
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:40.880]  large put option position on the s and p right before things really broke down
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:45.280]  in the ukraine which you know i'd know from you that he was funding the
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.640]  protest there so he would have profited hugely
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.840]  when he sold that position when it took a nosedive
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.640]  um after the unrest kind of reached a crescendo there so it's kind of a
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.400]  9 11 uh put option scandal that i think you guys should look into
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.320]  very interesting uh again and let me write that down how the reporters look
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:07.120]  into it what was this he put a put option in
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:12.240]  against the s and p yeah there's a uh there's an article in market
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:17.760]  watch the source doubles a bearish bet on s and p to the tune of 1.3
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.120]  billion and if you know put option position
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:24.400]  that you know it's worth sure and then he goes in and he destabilizes the
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:27.520]  country and that's what he constantly does i mean i know he's in their market
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.800]  rigging i know he's in there saying this may bring down europe which he's
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:35.200]  betting against right now he just is an absolute monstrous little pig
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.160]  he would have made zillions on that so you guys
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:42.960]  ought to look into that um other than that from bank caucus like it's really
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:46.240]  weird here um i'm about ready to leave i think but uh the cancer

[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:39.120]  it's encouraging to me that you know people in europe and switzerland
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:42.880]  world wider understanding what's going on and it really gives me a lot of hope
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.040]  that my kids will be able to live in a uh in a world without
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:51.920]  you know terrorism to do this do this exactly write a description

[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:59.440]  and absolutely so the swiss i'm going to get into their whole
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:02.880]  story and and how they started when the austrians were oppressing them and then
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:06.560]  there was an uprising and they killed a bunch of the austrian trips and it's
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:10.080]  all about the austrians coming to take their their their crossbows
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:16.160]  so there the america got its ideas from swiss the british and the dutch
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:21.600]  who had armed the citizen movements and so their fight just came over here
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:25.120]  and switzerland we had the police by the third day covering in switzerland our
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:28.480]  reporters joining us in like torch-lit
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:33.760]  processions like out of a frankenstein movie
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:37.760]  okay because we had members of their federal government showing up saying get
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:41.440]  out david rockefeller i mean they get it they don't want to be slaves
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:44.960]  that's why they're rolling in piles of cash and the highest standard of living
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:47.840]  worldwide and just are so rich they can't help themselves
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:51.360]  because they didn't join the new world order bankers we did
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.760]  we're screwed well thank you ben uh let's talk to johnny in florida johnny
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:59.920]  you're on the air go ahead thanks for waking me up alex uh
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:03.120]  been listening every day for the past three years and uh i try to spread the
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:06.080]  word as much as possible um i just want to point out
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.080]  and uh as all these situations have become prevalent whether it's libya
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.000]  syria ukraine and not as deep with russia the matters are waking up to the
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.520]  new world order in this global technocracy um and it's captured the
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:20.800]  federal government and i think it's just rendering itself for legitimate
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:23.920]  uh my question to you is is it only connected to dissonance and the
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:27.440]  psychological warfare we've been under or is there something greater that's
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:31.120]  holding humanity back and what's it going to take for us to finally be fed up
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.520]  with all the garbage that's going on in this world
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:36.400]  thanks that's all i got i bless you great question i think you probably know
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:39.440]  the answer it's a lot of things there's chemicals in the food and water and the
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:43.440]  television we become spectators and the government at the low
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.280]  level isn't bad people on average show how do we get mad at them
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:50.880]  we don't we need to get the point out that the the the globalists have gotten
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:53.760]  control at the top but what's holding us back is we still
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:57.440]  got food in our bellies even though it's poison gmo
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.120]  the romans would hand out free bread and roam to control the population
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:05.600]  they call it the dole and so they're taking our liberty and our freedom but
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:10.400]  still we've got enough food and so that's why they're able to
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.240]  progress is that you know still life in the west
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:17.200]  is better than it's it's is in the third world and it's
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:21.120]  still better than any other time in history so we've got great economic
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:25.760]  spoils and great opportunities the world is great in many ways
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.200]  and we're adaptive and so as things start to get bad we kind of muddle through
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:31.920]  it and live through it we need to realize there's a prime
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.960]  evil an anti-human directive and that the globalists are taking us somewhere
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:38.880]  bad you've got to explain to people that hey
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.800]  you don't want to go down the spider hole we're up to the edge of it right

[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:55.280]  bad men are running things we need to get them out of control
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:00.480]  they want to crush us because they know we could reverse the tide

[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:17.040]  adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:19.840]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:23.280]  we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet

[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:21.040]  cnbc get ready for the dow at 16 000 by
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:25.680]  2016 says a pro and he broke that down with them a few weeks
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:28.400]  ago so i wanted to get him on i really appreciate him
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:31.520]  coming on harry dent.com and he wants to get into
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:37.600]  2014 the year of defaults for china and germany falls off the
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:40.800]  demographic cliff and how that affects us here and
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.880]  when we hit our baby boomer demographic cliff and more mr dent
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:47.920]  thanks for coming on nice to be here alex
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:52.080]  well break it down for us well first off i'd like to cover this dow at 6 000 by
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:54.800]  2016 and then get into the demographic cliff
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:57.920]  well you know i'll explain other reasons but there's a big pattern in the
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:00.560]  stock market that should be more obvious to people
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:05.760]  we've seen three bubbles now one that peaked in 2000 and 2007 and then now
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:09.280]  each bubble has gone to new highs but each crash
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:14.240]  in between has gone to new lows so this this is called a megaphone pattern it's
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:18.000]  it's a very similar pattern to how the stock market peaked the last time a
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.960]  generation peaked in the late 60s early 70s there were
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:25.040]  three tops at higher highs and then a big crash in 73 74
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:28.720]  this would project that the dow is going to hit about 17 000
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.320]  in the next couple months and then it's going to fall in the next couple years
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:36.800]  to just below 6 000 so that's a bigger crash than last time
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:41.120]  that's like a 65 drop so this is not something you should listen to your
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:45.520]  stock broker and say oh just just stay the course the stocks will come back
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.040]  when stocks have peaked with major generational spending peaks like in
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:53.680]  1929 and 1968 stocks did not get back to those
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:59.440]  levels for 24 to 25 years so we're in i think for the largest
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:03.040]  downturn in our life it's going to be very much like the 1930s what i call a
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:08.560]  big debt detox uh so so people really need uh you know i i actually
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:11.760]  took a 70 cut in my advance from my publisher
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:16.320]  to get the demographic clip book out early this year because i i think we're
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:20.560]  close to a top here and i think people need to make some very hard decisions
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.360]  i agree i want to talk about that book again but expanding on this
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:28.560]  you're not the only analyst saying this and we see governments creeping towards
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:33.360]  the pension funds uh both the public and private the IRAs all of it
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:37.200]  they're going to quote save it i i guess when the plunge comes by taking it
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:39.760]  over to taxing it seems to be what they're openly
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:43.120]  saying they're going to do i don't think a lot of this is hidden
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:47.280]  but i'm not hearing a larger discussion of it well you know i mean uh
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:50.720]  people should be worried i mean taxes are gonna have to go up the government
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:54.560]  has promised entitlements it can never ever ever pay
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:57.920]  especially in a difficult economy that i'm painting and seeing
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:02.480]  for the next six to ten years uh our population forecasts are much higher
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:06.000]  than than they're gonna actually be births are falling immigration falls in
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.080]  times like this and this is what happened
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:12.640]  in the 1930s so so yeah people i mean taxes are going to go up in all different
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:15.360]  types of ways and especially more fluent people
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:18.880]  if you don't protect your wealth from this bubble burst and protect your
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:22.640]  wealth from taxes uh you're going to be in for big surprise
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:25.920]  and then in the next several years i want to get more into that and what your
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:28.800]  book breaks down the technicals but specifically
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:32.560]  how would you protect your wealth for the average person
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:35.440]  well you know here's the thing to understand that we warn people about
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:39.200]  this is only happens once in a lifetime it's a bubble boom
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:43.760]  bursting a debt bubble bursting and when that happens all financial assets go
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.520]  down and all you have to do is go back and look at the crash in 2008
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.120]  stocks went down hearing around the world large cap small cap
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:55.360]  asia euro emerging countries uh real estate went down
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:59.440]  commodities went down gold and silver went down and everybody was told well
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:04.160]  you can protect yourself with gold and silver not in a deflationary crash
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:08.000]  an inflationary recession or crisis like the 1970s
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.880]  gold and silver was great it will not do well in this
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:14.640]  so you basically have to take your profits off the table get safe
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:17.520]  i mean you can short the markets if you want but that takes some
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:21.040]  guts and that's risky but if you just get in safe
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.640]  investments when everything falls you're going to be able to buy stocks you know
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:28.800]  20 30 40 cents on the dollar i mean real estate 30 40 cents on the
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:31.520]  dollar and and and everything else so so that's
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:35.280]  the trick that's what joseph kennedy did in the great depression he got out of
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:38.240]  the stock market at the top when his shoeshine boy was telling him buy
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:41.920]  stock he said oh man this thing got to be over same thing i had every cap
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:46.240]  driver giving me internet tips in late 99 i knew that one was about over
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:50.080]  and then he just bought when things were down and he made a fortune
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:53.760]  that's right and so it's an opportunity for those that are positioned
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:58.960]  beforehand looking at that though obviously there there there's a race
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:02.320]  devaluing currencies and i guess the establishment thinks well there's
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:06.240]  actually a depressionary thing coming that will somehow balance out
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:09.920]  how does the inflation on the dollar or other currencies then
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:15.600]  tie into a deflationary situation uh in the rest of the economy
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.120]  well you know the one thing out deflation is good for the dollar when we
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:23.440]  started to deflate and debt started to be leveraged in late 2008 the US dollar
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:27.840]  went up 27 percent it was the only thing that did go up
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:30.880]  versus other currencies now the reason this happens
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:33.600]  people don't understand and this is this something we have to argue with the
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:37.040]  gold bugs about constantly but the US dollar
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:42.960]  fell 58 percent from 1985 it's it's high in the Reagan era down to the
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:46.320]  beginning of this recession in early 2008 we're at bottom
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:50.000]  58 percent the reason is we created massive amounts of
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.920]  debts trade deficits and now QE on top of that we've
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.320]  created massive amounts of money and that devalues that debases the currency
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:03.040]  we debase the dollar in the boom when you get this bubble burst
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:07.840]  when debt deleverages you're destroying money when when financial assets go
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:11.040]  and the Dow goes from 617,000 to 6,000 that is
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:14.480]  destroying two-thirds of people's wealth in the stock market
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:18.160]  overnight less dollars chasing the same goods
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:21.840]  is the definition of deflation and that's how you get deflation but less
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:25.280]  dollars also means they're more scarce and we're
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:30.640]  reversing the debasement of our our currency so really this this crisis is
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:34.240]  exactly what would put the dollar back in balance would make real estate more
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:37.840]  portable for young families again stocks better long-term
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.360]  investments all this sort of stuff we need this reset and
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:46.160]  governments just don't want it to happen because nobody wants the music to stop
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:49.440]  you know on their chair you know everybody wants the crisis to hit the
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:53.520]  next administration so central banks and politicians around the
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:56.720]  world just keep printing money to cover over the crisis
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:00.640]  keep the banks from falling over the banks would have gone under a lot of them
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:04.000]  we would have we had a 1930s scenario building and you know what
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.840]  as bad as the 30s were we had a huge debt detox
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.080]  and we basically cut the debt from 190 percent of GDP in this country
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:17.040]  just 60 percent in the next several years and that allowed us to grow again
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:22.560]  I started your bone started your bone yeah incredible boom to follow that we came
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:25.680]  roaring out of it we're not coming out of this i cover in chapter two in the
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:29.200]  book i talk about the japan coma economy
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:33.520]  japan has been doing this qe stuff since 1997 when they went off their
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:37.200]  demographic cliff and i was one of the only people in the world that predicted
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:42.640]  the downturn of japan in 1989 um and and they've been doing qe ever since
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:46.560]  they have not uh deleveraged their debt they have not rebalanced their economy
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:49.280]  i mean i mean undoubtedly you're right that's why they call you you know top
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:54.240]  pro and cnbc but let's just expand on this then in in layman's terms for folks
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:57.920]  what with with what the global policies are right now versus what we think they
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:00.160]  should be what do you see happening the next few
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:03.440]  years does this happen overnight does it happen in a process
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:07.200]  i mean i don't you generally i mean i know you don't have a crystal ball
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:11.280]  but but what do you see happening well we we do kind of have a crystal ball we
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:15.520]  predicted this downturn alex by the way my first book in 1989 we predicted the
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:20.240]  simultaneous collapse of japan in the 90s and the greatest boom in history
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:23.600]  and the greatest stock market surge in history for the united states in europe
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:28.480]  what we do as we look at demographics people enter the workforce age 20 earn
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:32.080]  and spend more money raising their kids and families buying houses borrowing
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:36.160]  money and they peak at age 46 now everybody doesn't but the average
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:39.200]  person spends the most money in their life at age 46
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:43.200]  so the simplest indicator i have of many but it is i call it the spending way
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:47.120]  we just move forward the birth index in any developed country
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:50.720]  and move it forward 46 years for that peak and spending well people will have
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:54.560]  the highest impact the highest numbers and that would have told but me and then
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:59.280]  it did tell me in 1988 that we had a boom from 1983 with baby boomers it was
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:04.240]  going to last until about 2007 and then the baby bust would slow down our
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:08.880]  economy less spending less house buying less borrowing all those things until
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:12.960]  about 2023 so we predicted these demographic headwinds and
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:15.600]  that we would go into a crisis starting in 2008
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:19.520]  just with demographic but but there's another factor that's equally important
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:23.520]  we've seen the greatest debt bubble which then in turn fueled the greatest
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:29.040]  real estate bubble in modern history debt got up to about four times gdp in
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:33.360]  this country versus 190 percent at the top of the roaring 29 bubble so twice as
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:37.040]  much debt and that doesn't count 67 trillion dollars in
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:40.960]  unfunded entitlement that's my question how do those two bubbles collapsing
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:44.160]  go together they go down at the same time or yeah
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:47.680]  well that's what happened at some point when when this qe doesn't work or
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:51.040]  something triggers like like last time the subprime price in the u.s.
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:55.440]  triggered stock crashes and debt crises around the world
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:58.640]  because all it takes is a trigger when demographics are slowing
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:02.560]  and debt is is twice as high as it's ever been in history and four times to be
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:06.080]  counted entitlement all it takes is something to pop the bubble
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:09.520]  I think it's going to be Germany going off the Germany's
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:13.120]  downturn looks just like japan's did to us in the late 80s
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:16.560]  it's the steepest downturn in demographic spending of any country in the
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:22.160]  world at this point and china's got on off the charts and I mean off the charts
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:26.560]  real estate and debt bubble they have overbuilt everything in their economy
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:31.680]  10 12 15 years ahead for and move people 220 million people in

[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:37.120]  subject the start of the next segment the economy and we will take a few phone
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:39.840]  calls for our guests he's got his new book out
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:44.000]  dealing with this and and i mean i don't just immediately believe whatever i
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.400]  read he's had so many predictions that have come
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:50.080]  accurately true he of course was a big strategist at bane capital that
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:52.720]  has to understand the future of companies and things to make the right
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:56.640]  decisions what they do in acquisitions or in sales
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:24:59.920]  but when you look at this this is all the big governments talk about
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:04.560]  is the demographic cliffs you've got from italy to japan
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:09.760]  to russia to germany to england to the whole uk the us canada
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:17.360]  you got a 1.4 1.3 1.5 replacement rate you need 2.1 children parents have 2.1
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:21.040]  children on average to just replace the society
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:24.880]  so it's not just a demographic boom cliff we're at
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:28.080]  it's that's the death of the west that pat b canan wrote about a decade ago so
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:32.240]  you were getting into china and the time bomb uh and they've got all their
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:35.600]  crazy problems in just empty ghost cities they've built
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:39.600]  and then you've got all the government corruption going on
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:43.840]  and no real social goals and then a police state being set up
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:48.560]  well i mean where is it all going to go as all these countries go off the cliff
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:51.520]  in the next five years well you know it can only go one
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:55.440]  direction japan's already showed us what happened japan was the first country
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:58.800]  to see their baby boom peak they had a real estate bubble
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:02.560]  people thought real estate can never go down i said no this bubble's gonna burst
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:07.040]  their stock bubble burst so that's what happens wealth gets destroyed suddenly
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:11.680]  then real estate goes down people realize real estate's down 60 percent in japan
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:15.600]  and never has bounced 22 years later because you got
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:19.120]  more older people dying and they're sellers of real estate
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:23.360]  than young people who buy between the age of 27 and 42 i mean we know exactly
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:27.840]  when people buy them so so people don't realize the consequences not only is the
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:31.120]  baby boom peaking in more and more countries and when it does
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:35.040]  you see these bubbles burst you see real estate go down you see stocks collapse
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:38.800]  and that causes bad loans and banks and then they fail and then that destroys
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:43.040]  debt and that destroys money as i said these bubbles do burst japan
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:46.880]  already burst and everybody's thinking well that's just japan well the us came
[02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:50.880]  next we predicted that europe is the next
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:55.440]  major region to see a major downturn in demographic spending starting with
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:00.800]  germany the steepest the uk austria and then italy
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:05.040]  but then all these countries go off the cliff and east asia japan's gone off it
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:08.720]  but south korea comes a few years from now china
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:12.720]  is the first emerging country to see their workforce peak it's already
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:17.200]  slowing it'll slow a bit the next 10 years and then they go off the cliff
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:21.440]  an emerging country all other emerging countries have incredible demographic
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:25.120]  trends for decades to come so so this is predictable stuff
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:28.800]  but the important part as i said earlier with all this debt and all these real
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.160]  estate bubbles around the world and the real estate bubble in china
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:36.720]  is is far more far more overvalued than anywhere else and then with a high
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:39.840]  vacancy rates i mean can you imagine a real estate market
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:44.000]  where you got 27 percent of condos vacant and prices are still going on so
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.040]  what happens nasa came out with a report yesterday
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:50.720]  and said the end of industrialized society the british ministry report
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.320]  in 2007 was classified but leaked saying they believe in
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:59.200]  maybe basically global total collapse and the governments are digging in for
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:04.080]  that uh why not try to reverse this is there any way to reverse it
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:07.200]  you know the only thing you do you could learn a lesson from business
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:09.600]  governments could i call it chapter 11 you know
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:12.320]  they used to have chapter seven bankrupts which they have where you just
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:16.080]  basically a fire sale you sell the assets distributed
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:19.600]  proceeds the creditors and you're over well that's a dumb way to do it
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:23.040]  united states came up with the innovation of chapter 11 where the courts
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:27.280]  protect a company long enough for it to sell off its assets and more
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:32.720]  orderly not a fire sale to cut costs and most importantly the renegotiate
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:35.360]  debts with creditors you go to your creditors they look
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:38.480]  if we go on fire sale you're going to get 10 cents on the dollar be lucky
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:42.560]  but if you we if you let us write down your debt to a 50 percent which is a
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:46.080]  win-win for you and then we'll be able to continue forward
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:50.320]  we need to restructure the debt we wasn't just the 17 trillion dollars in
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:55.360]  government debt we created 42 trillion dollars in private debt
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:29:00.400]  and that debt basically most of it was created under george bush between 2000
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:04.880]  2008 the during the bubble part of the boom if we just wrote that debt
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:08.320]  back down to pre-bubble levels we would get rid of 21
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:12.880]  22 trillion dollars of debt overnight now the banks would have to take hits but
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:16.160]  they're the ones that should take this they're the ones that lent this money
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:19.040]  to unsophisticated they're the ones that created the derivatives
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:22.480]  yeah they created the derivatives that financial institutions
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:26.720]  need to take this hit not Homer Simpson and Homer Simpson's been taking the
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:30.400]  hit with underwater mortgages falling real if they do that again they're
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:33.760]  going to kill Homer Simpson and then and then who the banks can live off of
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:36.880]  if they kill the golden goose i want to ask you that and talk about your book
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:39.760]  that breaks this down that obviously everybody needs to read
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:43.600]  harry dent harry dent dot com is our guest i tell you what's scary
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.880]  everything he's saying is right there if you follow the news folks we'll be right
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:50.000]  back to break down his forecast
[02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:53.840]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:58.720]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:06.080]  introducing pro one all of your filtration in one system portable on the go
[02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:09.600]  no more do you have two or three filters to just reduce
[02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:13.120]  sodium fluoride you have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:16.720]  and up to 95 percent of hydrofluorosilic acid
[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:20.240]  advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:23.680]  white ceramic with new aqua medics advanced media

[02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:12.160]  it's always a tough vote because the average person
[02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:15.840]  thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt
[02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:20.400]  raising the debt ceiling which has done been done over a hundred times does not
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:24.080]  increase our debt it does not somehow promote
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:27.840]  profligacy all it does is it says you got to pay the bills that you've already
[02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:35.280]  racked up congress
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:43.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:48.160]  top economic forecasters specializing in demographic trends
[02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:51.440]  harry dent joins us we'll need to talk about his book coming out and
[02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:55.600]  break that down uh here in a moment and i want to
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:34:00.640]  go back to the cnbc report get ready for the dow at six thousand by 2016
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:04.240]  if i look at the socialist groups in government and some of the big banks
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:07.520]  that work with them who always want to saddle homer simpson
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:10.640]  with their bad bets and and their derivatives and other counterfeit
[02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:14.160]  instruments their plan is clearly set up at the police state being done
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:20.320]  worldwide they're financing that and then as things collapse pose like
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:24.160]  they're the savior and take over the pension funds the private pension funds
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:28.240]  the government pension funds and really not even scale back uh
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:33.920]  a lot of the uh payments uh and things that former government
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:37.360]  workers and others are going to be getting that are clearly unsustainable
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:41.040]  and so they don't take a haircut everybody else does
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:44.560]  and if you don't like it well homeland security now basically lists not liking
[02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:48.640]  the fellow reserve policies terrorism and the tea party is terrorist and
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:51.600]  uh returning veterans are dangerous and gun owners
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:55.440]  we see the move now to use north com homeland security
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:58.560]  as a domestic control arm in the storm that's coming
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:01.760]  and that they're going to use the economic crisis to get everybody on
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:05.520]  welfare basically use the scaled up industrial capacity
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:10.000]  to at least give people their bread and circus uh even though it's scaling down
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.320]  it's still scaled up from whatever was in history
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:16.080]  to where they can give people their bobbles their bread and circuses
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:21.600]  and then in exchange convert us to a authoritarian system where the big banks
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:25.520]  are above the law with corporate diplomatic community
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:28.880]  ruling over us with a form of global governance
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:32.320]  and a hundred trillion every decade in carbon taxes
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:36.800]  to fund and back their sdrs now mr dent from what i've studied you study
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:40.240]  demographics i study the wide spectrum but i know you study that as well
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:42.640]  you're one of the smartest guys out there on record when it comes to
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:46.720]  predicting things do you do you disagree with the gestalt i just threw out
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:50.720]  or do you add something to it because it looks like this is pretty well planned
[02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:54.800]  out to me well yeah that is the trend governments
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:58.560]  kind of take more power and yeah and things go wrong it gives them a reason
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:01.760]  to step in i i say it's even worse than that alex because
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:04.560]  what they're doing here is killing the golden goose
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:09.200]  they're they're rejecting the free market capitalists system that made us so
[02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:13.440]  rich that requires booms and busts inflation and depletion
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:17.840]  innovation creative destruction you have to have failure as part of the system
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:21.440]  it doesn't work without success and failure and they're just saying no
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:24.720]  nothing can fail we can't let big companies go on and we can't let banks
[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:29.280]  that made terrible loans go under and we can't flush this debt out of our system
[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:32.480]  like i say the best thing that could happen for for the average household
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:35.920]  is they get their mortgage written down to what the house is now worth
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:40.560]  and i see houses going down much more in the next crisis so
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:44.080]  i think the only the only saving grace for me alex because politically
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:47.600]  we'll never deal with these entitlements we'll never deal with this debt
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:51.200]  well we'll never let government kind of take and give
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:54.480]  you know give up their control of the economy we're going to have to have a
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:57.840]  crisis the government's going to have to fail people going to have to lose faith
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:01.680]  in central banks quantitative easing which is just like taking more and more
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:04.800]  of a drug to keep coming down off the high that's all it does
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:08.880]  creating money out of thin air that's another way to create debt just like
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:13.920]  bank loans that get too high we need to basically have a crisis
[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:17.840]  so we can have a revolution because this is not going to happen politically
[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:21.520]  and i think you're right the government's almost in some way a crisis would
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:24.880]  give them the chance to step in and have more control and you know
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.240]  martial law and stuff at times but i think what's going to happen
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:32.080]  is the crisis is going to be so bad that people are going to lose faith
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:36.240]  in governments and especially china not you know economists say oh
[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:40.320]  china's like the new state capitalism the new model wow look how great they're
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:44.000]  doing china to me mark my words is going to prove
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.800]  that governments don't know how to manage economies and shouldn't manage
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:50.640]  economies they should should just set clear good simple rules
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:54.400]  and let the pre markets work and let them go up and down and let them succeed
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:57.440]  and let them fail let them invest let them innovate
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:00.720]  they're killing the golden goose so to me it's even worse
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:04.320]  than what you're saying because you kill capitalism
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:09.040]  and and and we're already aging we're already going to flow just from aging
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:13.520]  and flowing demographics like you say no replacement race for most populations
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:17.440]  and we're better than most because you know we have higher than japan or
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:22.240]  germany but but man china has really gone off the
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:27.200]  reservation if we're printing money they're printing condos and just
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:31.680]  building railroad stations and bridges and highways and office buildings and
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:34.960]  malls that are empty in cities and whole
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:37.600]  cities so so this is the craziest things that ever happened
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:43.440]  it i to me if we don't have a crisis soon we're in real trouble
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:48.000]  i agree with you but the establishment cannot
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.320]  stand to let things be somewhat free even somewhat but gotta micromanage it
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:55.120]  they've gotta give the insiders the knowledge they've
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:59.120]  gotta bail out goldman sacks and jp morgan and then sign the debt on to us and
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:03.440]  have the media a year later say i mean in 2008 it was their fault a year
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:08.640]  later it was how i was in debt i was bad i owed the trillions i owed
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:11.520]  you know millions of dollars to the government and the aggregate
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:16.640]  a total fraud but i gotta say mr dent a lot of it lies with the public if the
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:20.080]  public politically is so mesmerized with justin
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:24.160]  beaver and lebron james and all the rest of the propaganda
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:27.600]  and have had liberty and wealth so long
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:31.520]  that the public not on not everybody but a large portion of them
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:38.000]  are delusional dumb down stupid lazy gimme a handout
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:42.640]  uh scum who literally look at me and think i need to pay more
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:46.160]  so they can sit on their butts a do you agree with that be
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:48.800]  what happens when it all goes to hell in a handbasket
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:52.720]  i see the hordes of them voting in a democracy not a republic
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:54.960]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:58.640]  to literally politically bring an authoritarianism
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.800]  and absolutely make the producers their slaves or a french revolution
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:06.240]  i mean every angle of this i just see bad to worse
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:09.280]  well you know yeah i would add to that that we're also spoiled we've had the
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:13.280]  greatest boom in history really since world war two but but especially
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:17.680]  1983 the 2007 and that was just a 46 year lag
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:20.960]  that we show in the demographic clip as simple as economic tool
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:23.920]  just a 46 year lag on the baby boom birth index so
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:27.680]  this baby boom created a great boom but then but we thought hey yeah
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:30.320]  everybody's supposed to retire with a hundred thousand dollar a year of
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:32.640]  pensions and and you know all this you know
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:36.320]  social security medical medicare medicaid we can't even afford the
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:38.960]  health care we had and now we're expanding it
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:42.320]  paul ryan's plan wasn't even close to what it would take
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:46.480]  to balance out entitlements so we're spoiled and i think we need reality and
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:50.560]  i've got a hope that when things go down if we have a big enough crisis
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:54.800]  people will realize i mean governments economists businesses and
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:59.120]  everyday people realize we're bankrupt we're not bankrupt like chapter seven
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:02.240]  because we're still the largest country in the world we got better demographics
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:07.200]  than most of our competitors but we cannot go on with these debt
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:10.720]  levels in these entire we've got to write to ship to wake up and get real we
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:14.160]  got to wake up and smell the coffee and i think that's what the good thing is
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:18.240]  people realize i used to turn around companies at bayonet company and then i
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:21.920]  did it with small business as well and when a company's really in a crisis
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:25.680]  people get real really quick and you can make changes you can fire half the
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:27.680]  people and people agree to it because they realize
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:30.720]  if we don't fire half the people a hundred percent of us are going to lose
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:33.840]  our jobs and the company's going to die so people get more clear so
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:36.800]  i've got some level of faith that when we have a crisis
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:40.240]  people will wake up and they will get smarter about things and then they'll
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:43.680]  listen i hate this i mean most people don't listen to people like me oh i'm
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:46.320]  too bearish look i've been bullish for 20 some years i've
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:50.320]  predicted this great boom when nobody saw it come in and predicted the fall of
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:53.440]  japan and all these other countries to follow but
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:57.280]  but they'll start listening to people who told them the right things everybody's
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:01.840]  telling them it's okay one bullet of all people is getting out there saying
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:05.360]  it's okay the government's doing the right thing what how can the right thing
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:09.440]  be printing trillions of dollars out of thin air to cover over a deck right
[02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:13.120]  how could it possibly be the right thing and then signing us on to more debt
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:17.680]  and then obama obama saying raising debt doesn't raise debt
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:21.600]  yeah of course yeah i mean i agree we should just
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:25.120]  there has to be a standard it can't be gold anymore because gold isn't
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:28.160]  big enough and consistent enough with it with the new economy but
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:32.720]  we need standards that say debt can only grow this fast compared to gdp and can
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:36.640]  only reach certain limits you can't allow unlimited debt and that's what we've
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:39.840]  done we have run trade deficits since the early 70s
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:44.160]  we've run budget deficits except for a few years and they got bigger in the boom
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:47.200]  even canes are that crazy guy which he never
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:51.280]  invented his theory but at least he said governments should run surpluses
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:55.280]  in booms and then run deficits to balance out the private economy but
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:58.720]  we've been running budget deficits in booms
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:03.200]  and bust you can't and debt grew at 2.7 times gdp
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:07.760]  from 1983 to 2008 you can't have debt grow that much faster in the economy and
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:11.200]  not end up bankrupt and in a debt crisis any economy
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:14.640]  that didn't see this coming doesn't know their ass from a hole in the ball
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:18.480]  that's right let's talk about let's talk about gold
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:24.000]  i have goals an emergency backup hedge for collapse for inflation for whatever
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.960]  it is literally like pirates you know barrier gold
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:30.000]  that's what i've got it for i don't have it as an investment i bought most of my
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.920]  goal between 300 and 500 an ounce so even if it plunges or even goes up
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:37.680]  whatever i've got it i'm not selling it until you know we ever go to a
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:41.200]  road warrior situation and i know it'll have some value
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:44.720]  but but separate from that i mean are we talking about
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:48.880]  you know raw land we're talking about skills i mean for the average person
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:53.760]  what do you do well again gold is in a bubble i was debating peter shiff and
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:57.680]  st chis and i know you know him and he's saying gold's not in a box gold went up
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:03.600]  almost seven times between 2000 and then in 2011 that's a bubble we said
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:07.280]  gold the bubble is going to be the last bubble to burst it is bursting
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:12.240]  i think gold's going to see 700 an ounce by 2016 when the dow is at
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:16.400]  five or six thousand and i think it's going to see 250 to 400
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:20.560]  um around the turn of the next decade before a big commodity cycle
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:26.240]  uh uh bottoms i mean commodities peak every 29 30 years like a clock so so i
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:30.320]  don't agree with the gold bugs on that and the truth is there is nowhere to go
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:34.320]  you put your money in safe stuff liquid cash and cash flow is king
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:38.560]  in a deflationary crisis and then if you want stuff i want stuff i can trade i
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:42.480]  want shotgun shells you know i want little bourbon bottles i want and i
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:46.320]  want silver coins even more than gold no i agree i got more silver than gold
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:50.560]  yeah silver is great for for for exchanging and buy food you know
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:56.480]  dried foods and stuff uh cans of tuna in a crisis that's the sort of stuff that
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:44:59.360]  people are gonna you know harry this is scary because i study this every day
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:02.400]  as a layman from every angle and any way you look at it
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:06.640]  it runs from horrible to apocalyptic and absolutely
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:10.080]  i tell my listeners do this this is what i've been doing
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:13.200]  and i've got family that's awake but some family that says you've been saying
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:16.080]  this for so long they don't believe it because i was so
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:19.840]  visionary but if you study history these cycles are there
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:24.560]  and now i look at the u.s government the the the british defense ministry
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:28.000]  all the universities all their internal prospectuses
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.920]  actually say what you're saying but just like japan
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:34.960]  for 20 plus years has denied they're even in a recession
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:38.400]  they've been in a depression the uh i mean they're literally
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:42.080]  having mass mental illness just collapsing over there but if you read a
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:45.760]  japanese newspaper they say they're doing fine and i see that same scenario
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:49.520]  here we just slide into this compression and then
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:53.920]  and then they just keep denying it forever it's mass mental illness
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:57.200]  well and the best way of denial is quantitative easing you just keep
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:00.880]  throwing money in the economy like like taking more of a drug to keep from
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:03.440]  coming down that's all they're doing is masking it over
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:06.480]  we're not facing reality and again japan is proven
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:11.600]  they have an echo boom generation their economy should have turned up again
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:16.880]  around 2003 by our demographics and and it and it didn't very much and then
[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:20.240]  they went back and in a downturn it's because they've never dealt with their
[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:23.040]  debt they've never let their economy rebalance
[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:26.320]  you have to rebalance the free market system knows how to do this just like
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:29.920]  your body does if you eat bad sushi it'll just flush it out
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:34.000]  anyway it can that's what the economy was trying to do flush out this debt
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:37.360]  flush out these asset bubbles flush out these derivatives
[02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:41.120]  this is i mean we're on steroids and we're going to die from it
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:46.080]  uh and being a coma forever if we don't deal with this so so i just i'm
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:49.760]  i'm just waiting for the darn crisis to happen what's the time frame the next
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:53.600]  year too i think we're within a month or two
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:58.000]  of a stock talk stocks will go first and then real estate and economy will
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:01.600]  follow the economy goes down you're going to have bad bank loans
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:05.920]  rack up very quickly real estate you're saying six months to a year in big
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:10.320]  trouble yeah i say it starts this year and i think the biggest trigger it may
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:14.080]  not be the first trigger but the biggest trigger that makes this a crisis
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:17.040]  that central banks like the federal reserve cannot fight
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:20.320]  if that china bubble burst and it's already showing the cracks they're
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:22.880]  having uh wealth management products and
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:26.640]  institutions blow up and start to default and it's happening more and more
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:32.000]  that bubble people don't understand the chinese the rich chinese top 10 percent
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:35.840]  control 60 percent of income 50 percent of consumer spending
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:39.040]  85 percent of the real estate and financial assets
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:43.360]  and they save 65 to 70 percent of their money
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:46.960]  and they invest it all in real estate they don't like stocks and bonds and
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:50.800]  they're and their stock market's been a total roller coaster they also buy gold
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:54.800]  yeah and they buy gold so if they if their wealth collapses because it's real
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:57.920]  estate bubble classes they're gonna stop buying real estate around the world
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:01.520]  they're gonna have to stop investing they're gonna stop spending and
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:05.440]  china will implode everybody says there's gonna be a soft landing in china
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:09.120]  you don't have an extreme they're already having thousands of riots a month
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:12.720]  yeah and then the rich people are leaving the country voluntarily they are
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:16.880]  leaving when i was just in australia for three weeks uh promoting the book and
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:21.360]  stop the lecturing and it's like chinese are buying everything in in
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:25.520]  australia and they're buying southern california san francisco vancouver
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:29.520]  london new york they're evacuating keeping the bubble going when they stop
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:31.920]  buying like the japanese did in the early 90s
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:35.360]  we're going to see real estate bubbles collapse around the world especially in
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:39.760]  the most bubbly city that this this is going to be a major crisis because real
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:43.440]  estate is what really hits people well harry dan i mean i've had you on
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:47.680]  before you've never been this wound up i mean you you you're really concerned
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:52.640]  no no i am i mean again i i cut the demographic clip i went to public i had
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:57.040]  to change publishers and cut my advance 70 percent because i said this book
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:00.400]  my publisher wanted to get out in september i said it's going to be over
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:04.160]  by then we're going to be into the crisis i want to warn people before it
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:07.760]  happens because this only happens once in a lifetime that's why like you say
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:12.080]  people are delusional they don't understand this a depression like this a
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:16.720]  debt detox whatever you want to call it um a deflationary crisis only
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:19.680]  happens once in a lifetime so people don't see it coming
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:22.560]  they don't understand it and they don't know what to do when it happens this
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:26.240]  book tells you from a to z what's going to happen
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:30.080]  what's going to go bad i want to carry it i'm going to go down and then what to
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:34.000]  do about it there is some you can this can be the most profitable time in your
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:38.320]  life if you simply see the inevitable while everybody else is in delusion and
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:41.040]  denial wow man we got to get you back sooner i
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:43.440]  promise to go to calls when we got like 10 minutes left we want to break in a
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:46.640]  minute uh rb uh wants to talk to the guests from
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:49.840]  minnesota you're on the air with mr jen go ahead
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:55.760]  yeah hi alex hi harry um i've really noticed that in the wake of the ngo
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:50:00.400]  slash e u slash us a backed illegal coup of the democratically
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:04.160]  elected president of ukraine all these big
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:07.920]  uh central banks have just been salivating like dogs around a dog bowl
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:12.000]  it's just disgusting and then on top of that you see like this
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:17.200]  the big world vampire squid the e u and the junior world vampire squid golden
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:21.760]  sacks is salivating like dogs what do you think is going to happen there
[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:25.120]  well you know uh this this is something we also cover in the book we have a
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:28.160]  geopolitical cycle and i don't know what causes but
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:32.880]  18 years we'll have a good world where nothing goes wrong like 1983 to 2000
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:36.560]  then from 2001 starting with 9 11 in the tech rec
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:41.040]  and going all the way to the iraq war afghanistan war you know the syria the
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:44.320]  arab spring the indian spring and now russian your dream
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:49.120]  we just had a series of political challenges geopolitical problems around
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:51.200]  the world i think this is going to get worse
[02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:54.400]  i think you know it's kind of a little bit like hitler repute and says okay
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:58.240]  we took over Crimea but they wanted us anyway we're not going any far that he
[02:50:58.240 --> 02:51:01.360]  wants ukraine he wants to rebuild the soviet union
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:04.880]  russia has some of the worst demographics in the world ahead in fact
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:08.400]  they're the one of the few countries that has a declining life expectancy
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:11.680]  because they're drinking themselves to death they ever watched a russian movie
[02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:15.760]  you'd understand why i think this is going to get worse
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:21.280]  and in this geopolitical cycle doesn't turn positive until 2020 so we got six
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:25.600]  more years of this sort of stuff so expect more of this expect more geopolitical
[02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:29.040]  conflicts expect more problems in the middle east but that's the way to see
[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:32.240]  these governments is they're all like vampire squid like the caller said
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:36.240]  trying to just grab something to eat it so it's like two vampire squid
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:39.600]  trying to grab ukraine and absorb it well that's everyone they're like a
[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:42.320]  business they want to gain market share like you said earlier they want to gain
[02:51:42.320 --> 02:51:46.400]  more control over the economy the economy works best when when there's just
[02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:49.520]  good solid rules and you do need rules to the game
[02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:54.240]  but and then you let the private economy innovate and grow and rebalance
[02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:56.240]  itself should we bring last eagle back
[02:51:56.240 --> 02:51:59.840]  controlling everything should we bring last eagle back
[02:51:59.840 --> 02:52:04.640]  yeah yeah that's unique banks should not you shouldn't have all these people in
[02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:08.000]  all these businesses banks should be banks investment banks
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:11.360]  should be investment banks brokerage firms should be brokerage firm
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:14.960]  investment i don't even like brokerage firms and investment firms being
[02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:18.080]  mixed up because now the broker is going to sell you their own stuff
[02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:20.960]  whether it's in your interest or not i mean that that's that's what they're
[02:52:20.960 --> 02:52:24.720]  going to be motivated to i think the financial institutions that's the
[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:28.480]  biggest thing if we just let each sector do what they do and don't let them
[02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:32.080]  cross over that would eliminate a lot of the problems we've had
[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:38.320]  well i totally agree with you and again people need to get honest with
[02:52:38.320 --> 02:52:42.080]  themselves as a culture that that we're not just here putting out
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:46.080]  fear this this is this is what's going on you can debate exactly
[02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:51.680]  how the cookie's going to crumble but uh societally the denial has to end first
[02:52:51.680 --> 02:52:55.920]  to have a real debate to then give the political class the courage to the right
[02:52:55.920 --> 02:52:58.880]  thing because not everybody in the power structure is bad
[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:02.000]  and a lot of the people in the power structure are scared right now
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:05.600]  they just can't get the public to make the right decisions either
[02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:10.560]  no that's right i mean i mean that is what's needed and and my my problem is
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:14.000]  usually i get on cnbc i'm glad to be on here and have more time
[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:17.520]  and i got three minutes to explain this i can't explain this in three minutes
[02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:21.680]  i spent six to seven hours with with audiences in brisbane and sydney and
[02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:26.400]  australia and really got to educate people a to z about this and once you
[02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:30.560]  do p there is no debate people agree with me because we're looking at the facts
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:34.080]  we're looking at reality like you say and this is undeniable we prove
[02:53:34.080 --> 02:53:37.760]  everything we say everything i say in the book there's a graph to show the
[02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:42.000]  correlation and show whether this is actually i i've read book 700 pages
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:45.200]  long not a graph on them on economics how can you do that so
[02:53:45.200 --> 02:53:50.000]  if people have time to get educated on this they will see people are not stupid
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:54.160]  if it's explained to them correctly but it's not and like you say everybody
[02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:58.000]  governments and different businesses and institutions all have their motives
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:01.920]  and nobody's telling you the truth i don't work for anybody i'm not at
[02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:06.640]  maryl lancer or some major company i can say what i find whether it's
[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:10.880]  bullish or bearish and then no matter what political persuasion it may fall
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:15.280]  under at the time i can say what i need to say to people and i tell you most
[02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:17.920]  people cannot tell you the truth your stockbroker
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:21.520]  cannot tell you the truth absolutely cannot they would be fired from their
[02:54:21.520 --> 02:54:26.000]  farm if they did so
[02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:29.200]  let's go back to the other phone calls here and see what they have to say
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:33.760]  let's talk to justin quickly in florida go ahead justin
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:37.040]  um just want to say great points i agree with what you're saying here
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:41.120]  and uh good solutions too i guess my other question is since you pretty much
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:44.560]  touched on everything is what do you make of the uh the recent bankers dropping
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:48.640]  like flies oh would you say bankers a lot of
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:52.240]  banker suicides a lot of broker suicides high-level people
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:55.360]  oh well i mean you know you know what happened in 1930s people were jumping
[02:54:55.360 --> 02:54:59.680]  off buildings i mean these people i mean they a lot of them
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:03.600]  really need to be tried and in criminal courts what a lot of what happened
[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:06.400]  here uh in a lot of things and when this things
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:09.840]  fails it is going to hit financial institution it's going to hit
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:13.760]  new york city big time anybody who just bought a condo for
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:17.680]  hundred million dollars is going to lose their ass on that rich people think
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:20.480]  you can't possibly lose buying a downtown manhattan
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:24.160]  this is going to especially hit financial institutions and their
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:28.400]  executives and people so there's going to be way more of this
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:32.400]  ahead and then that's unfortunate but that's that's just a reality
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:36.960]  there you go great question justin let's talk to wilbur in new york
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:42.400]  go ahead hi alex yes sir hi harry harry i get your newsletter boom and bust it's
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:46.160]  a good newsletter uh well let me say i do a lot of analysis like
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:49.680]  you do uh macro microeconomics technical
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:54.160]  cyclical analysis demographic analysis like you do
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:59.200]  my question to you is given the massive uh housing real estate
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:02.880]  boom a bubble that you talked about in china which makes ours look like child's
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:05.840]  plate and now the ukraine situation where we have
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:09.840]  really really now are duking it out how deep
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:13.600]  do you think this downturn this next shoo down is going to be
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:17.520]  i know prector robert has got his opinions on it too i'd like to see when
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:20.400]  you're thinking this is going to happen because i'm absolutely seeing it it's
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:24.480]  going to be within weeks to months not years how deep you see it and will this
[02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:27.520]  change the course of events assuming the elite
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:30.960]  you know don't not oh yeah they always try to start wars here in the stuff
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:35.120]  sir yeah you know uh bubbles burst they always burst
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:38.960]  and they go back to where they started a little lower that the dow has to get back
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:42.880]  to 3800 just to erase the bubble housing has to go
[02:56:42.880 --> 02:56:47.440]  down 55 percent just to erase the bubble back to early 2000 when it started
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:51.040]  and will probably go down 65 percent so i see a much bigger
[02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:54.320]  housing downturn of the next several years stocks are going to probably go
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:58.240]  down in two waves the next wave takes us like you say i think it's going to top
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:02.480]  by early may have not earlier it's 17000 roughly we're going to go
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:06.560]  6000 a little below in the next one then we'll have a bounce after that for a
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:10.000]  year or two and then buy it by 2019 or 20 i think you're
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.120]  going to see three to four thousand the doubt i love the debate robert
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:16.880]  prector because he says i'm too bullish he's predicting six to 100 a thousand
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:20.160]  let's talk to abe in california we got about 30 seconds for me to ask the
[02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:22.880]  question hey ask your question
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:25.840]  hey peace be upon you it's just a quick comment i wanted to make about the
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:29.280]  whole humanity situation where we lie as a species
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:33.360]  look we mind body and spirit need to rediscover ourselves we need to
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:37.040]  immerse ourselves in the natural five senses then when we discover we will
[02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:41.840]  discover the sixth sense what is which is essentially a pioneer we got to go
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:45.120]  man this is a question but we do have to get back to being real people again
[02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:48.320]  and and not just mindless consumers that believe whatever television says
[02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:53.040]  final comment mr dent well you know we have a 250 year revolution cycle the
[02:57:53.040 --> 02:57:56.480]  last one was the american revolution and the industrial revolution so i think
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:00.080]  we are going to see a big revolution ahead i just told people
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:04.000]  read this book the demographic cliff i i killed myself to get this thing out in

[03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:34.960]  all right i didn't get to a bunch of news i was going to cover in there
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:40.800]  because we had a guest on but man and again folks that's from the whole
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:43.920]  bane capital angle what you were just hearing and i know that's the new world
[03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:47.520]  order that's uh mitt romney but i mean he was there a long time ago
[03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:50.160]  was very successful there so split off in his own deal
[03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:53.520]  just as an analyst on on companies that were buying in things and
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:56.640]  he is one of the most accurate predictors out there and that's who we
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:59.520]  bring you people that know what they're talking about and it doesn't mean
[03:00:59.520 --> 03:01:03.120]  everything's gonna happen just the way we say but statistically we're right
[03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:07.840]  more than other people and my gut is what i follow not
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:12.160]  intellectually i look at everything militarily i look at everything
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:18.080]  societally historically spiritually that last one spiritually you know your
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:21.840]  gut your soul your mind
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:27.200]  uh i've i've told you bad moon rising last year
[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:32.000]  i've been saying that since october i mean it's just it's it's
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:37.120]  my alarm bells are going off so hard now that i'm almost just calm it's just
[03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:41.040]  like we're already in it and i'm telling you it's going
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:43.760]  to be a time bomb when all this stuff goes deep six
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:46.080]  and the reason i went into some overdrive was to make this point take a
[03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:48.800]  few calls we have time i gotta hit this news i think i'm sorry
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:53.200]  collars were done is that if we don't get our message of
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:56.320]  liberty out now the socialists the communists the
[03:01:56.320 --> 03:02:00.720]  collectivists run by the big banks who are at war with the free market
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:04.640]  are going to scapegoat the free market and america and freedom for all the
[03:02:04.640 --> 03:02:08.400]  stuff that's happened we certainly deserve some blame for letting it
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:12.160]  happen but we didn't drive the bus we're not captaining the ship
[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:15.520]  goldman sacks jp morgan are you just heard dent formerly a bank capital
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:19.360]  saying that and they make a lot of the calls
[03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:23.120]  and advice to people at goldman sacks
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:33.040]  this is really bad okay if we don't get the message out and blame who did it
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:37.200]  we're going to get blamed i just got chills we're going to get blamed and
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:42.080]  they are going to screw us up one side and down the other
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:45.680]  the move is authoritarianism the plan is authoritarianism
[03:02:45.680 --> 03:02:49.840]  this has been done by design he talks about creative destruction
[03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:53.040]  to build a better system through free market they have created destruction
[03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:56.560]  through socialism to destroy us so they are the ones left
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:02:59.840]  standing the opposite of the type of creative destruction he was talking
[03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:04.080]  about milton freeman style and that's how folks get confused in
[03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:08.000]  economics as they have to say the full spectrum of it
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:13.440]  i have all the major schools and let me tell you
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:17.440]  all of them try to reflect the times they were in they they're not applicable
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:20.800]  to the time we're in now with the rigged computers the
[03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:23.920]  the high frequency trading oh it's it's it's rigged folks
[03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:27.840]  and that's what allows the establishment to do this and they're gearing up for a
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:31.680]  control collapse to fully take over and dent just agreed with me
[03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:34.400]  and everybody else agrees with me because there's no doubt
[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:37.520]  they're not going to let a good crisis go to waste
[03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:42.080]  other news i didn't get to here uh this is up on drudgereport.com and you

[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:53.520]  criminalize questioning of science and global warming and i mean
[03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:56.880]  this was published by the university saying arrest people
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:03:59.520]  that don't agree in carbon taxes and all this stuff i mean these people are
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:03.920]  flaming authoritarian dirtbags i mean they should be run out on a
[03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:08.480]  rail i'm for all free speech so you say arrest people for their speech
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:12.240]  you understand i'm all for speak free speech until

[03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:21.040]  is let's arrest people that don't agree with us i mean that
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:25.600]  that is hitlerian that is stylistic that's malistic that's
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:30.240]  that is anathema and i'm not saying
[03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:35.120]  it's just so weaponized they're coming after us they're saying this everywhere
[03:04:35.120 --> 03:04:38.160]  they're saying we're racist we don't agree with them it is a group
[03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:42.080]  of scum people should go to that university who were there have kids
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:46.400]  there young young people there and and this guy should be confronted
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:50.400]  this guy wants to put you in a gulag like i told you yesterday
[03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:53.120]  you understand that they're not playing games
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:59.680]  but come on for us get ready get ready get ready
