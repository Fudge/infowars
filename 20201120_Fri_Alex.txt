[00:00.000 --> 00:22.080]  It's November 20th.
[00:22.080 --> 00:24.240]  The year is 2020.
[00:24.240 --> 00:27.240]  That's 11, 20, 2020.
[00:27.240 --> 00:28.880]  Alex Jones here on the road.
[00:28.880 --> 00:31.000]  I was just at the Georgia Guidestones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.360]  We're about to enter back into Atlanta.
[00:33.360 --> 00:35.000]  And we're going to be demonstrating again
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.160]  at the Capitol building for several hours today
[00:39.160 --> 00:40.720]  with the protesters.
[00:40.720 --> 00:43.040]  More and more have been arriving.
[00:43.040 --> 00:46.280]  As most of you know, Georgia did exactly what Trump
[00:46.280 --> 00:47.880]  and Giuliani predicted.
[00:47.880 --> 00:50.120]  They ran the recount.
[00:50.120 --> 00:51.120]  The exact same way.
[00:51.120 --> 00:52.680]  That's not what the president asked for.
[00:52.680 --> 00:55.440]  He asked for the signatures to be verified.
[00:55.440 --> 00:59.600]  He asked for investigations of all the missing ballots
[00:59.600 --> 01:01.400]  that have now been confirmed.
[01:01.400 --> 01:03.600]  But the fight is far from over.
[01:03.600 --> 01:07.240]  They were going to certify the key Michigan election
[01:07.240 --> 01:09.520]  in Detroit until it turned out that people that were being
[01:09.520 --> 01:13.000]  threatened to certify it went public.
[01:13.000 --> 01:14.520]  The great news is the president met,
[01:14.520 --> 01:17.880]  we now learn yesterday, with the leaders of the Republican
[01:17.880 --> 01:21.040]  House and Senate there in Michigan.
[01:21.040 --> 01:24.040]  And that's really got the Democrats and their fraudsters
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.440]  in the deep state scared.
[01:25.440 --> 01:27.760]  Because this has all been illegitimate.
[01:27.760 --> 01:29.200]  And when there's proof of fraud,
[01:29.200 --> 01:31.240]  there's massive proof of fraud, it's
[01:31.240 --> 01:35.000]  got to be the legislatures that call emergency sessions.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.720]  That's why we've been in Georgia pushing for an emergency
[01:37.720 --> 01:39.760]  session to be called.
[01:39.760 --> 01:41.160]  We don't know if the governor is going
[01:41.160 --> 01:42.600]  to certify the day or tomorrow.
[01:42.600 --> 01:49.120]  It was the same bureaucrats and Rhino Republicans
[01:49.120 --> 01:53.160]  that have said that the recount yesterday
[01:53.160 --> 01:55.880]  did show basically the same numbers.
[01:55.880 --> 01:59.560]  Trump gained some votes, but it's at about 13,000 votes now,
[01:59.560 --> 02:01.320]  more for Biden.
[02:01.320 --> 02:03.920]  Remember, Trump was way ahead until days and days
[02:03.920 --> 02:07.320]  after they had frozen the election that night
[02:07.320 --> 02:09.680]  and then found all of these magic ballots.
[02:09.680 --> 02:12.560]  It's also been confirmed that tens of thousands of ballots
[02:12.560 --> 02:14.320]  are not creased, they've not been folded,
[02:14.320 --> 02:16.760]  they've not been in a machine, they've not been in an envelope.
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.440]  And a perfect machine on the Scantrons has bubbled them in.
[02:22.440 --> 02:27.720]  But again, CNN's Stonewalls, it says over and over and over
[02:27.720 --> 02:29.800]  again, along with all the other corporate establishment
[02:29.800 --> 02:32.840]  media, that there is no fraud, there is no proof,
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.480]  there's nothing happening.
[02:34.480 --> 02:37.560]  But now, CNN has the headlines of, you should be scared,
[02:37.560 --> 02:40.040]  you should be concerned, there's danger, there's danger.
[02:40.040 --> 02:41.600]  What Trump's doing with the legislatures?
[02:41.600 --> 02:43.640]  Yeah, because you've been caught with your fraud,
[02:43.640 --> 02:45.760]  just like Russian gate, just like Ukraine gate,
[02:45.760 --> 02:46.840]  just like everything else.
[02:46.840 --> 02:49.120]  And if the establishment corporate media
[02:49.120 --> 02:52.240]  can't hoodwink people into buying their gas lighting,
[02:52.240 --> 02:55.400]  their mass hoax, then that's game over for them.
[02:55.400 --> 02:59.360]  So Trump has a duty, not just a right,
[02:59.360 --> 03:02.240]  to stand up this fraud and say no to it.
[03:02.240 --> 03:03.960]  I'm not going to go back over all the numbers,
[03:03.960 --> 03:06.200]  but he won bigger in the battleground states
[03:06.200 --> 03:11.480]  than he did four years ago until they quit the counting.
[03:11.480 --> 03:14.560]  And remember what happened in Atlanta?
[03:14.560 --> 03:17.400]  Oh, at 10.30 at night, a water main broke.
[03:17.400 --> 03:19.000]  So for four hours, they had to stop counting.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.360]  The truth is, they put cardboard over the windows,
[03:21.360 --> 03:22.800]  there's video of this, and continued
[03:22.800 --> 03:26.160]  to count running Joe Biden ballots
[03:26.160 --> 03:29.520]  through three times a piece, the same ballot,
[03:29.520 --> 03:33.760]  until they were able to go past Trump.
[03:33.760 --> 03:36.160]  Then where were they counting those?
[03:36.160 --> 03:39.680]  Inside the CNN center, where they set up the vote counting,
[03:39.680 --> 03:42.200]  you cannot make up the irony.
[03:42.200 --> 03:45.640]  CNN doesn't just steal the truth from us,
[03:45.640 --> 03:48.880]  they steal our birthright, our heritage.
[03:48.880 --> 03:50.800]  I've been all over Atlanta, there's Trump signs
[03:50.800 --> 03:52.240]  all over the place in Atlanta.
[03:52.240 --> 03:54.640]  You don't even see Biden signs.
[03:54.640 --> 03:57.760]  When you're outside Atlanta, it's all you see
[03:57.760 --> 04:00.800]  is Trump signs, and everybody I talk to
[04:00.800 --> 04:02.120]  is saying the same thing.
[04:02.120 --> 04:05.480]  How is it that Trump did twice as good
[04:05.480 --> 04:08.720]  with Hispanic Americans, three times better than he did
[04:08.720 --> 04:11.080]  with Black Americans, just four years ago,
[04:11.080 --> 04:13.840]  but they're to tell us to believe that white males
[04:13.840 --> 04:15.760]  went against the president, and that's
[04:15.760 --> 04:17.400]  magically how this happened, yeah.
[04:17.400 --> 04:19.800]  You meet a bunch of old, dead white people,
[04:19.800 --> 04:22.600]  some of which have been dead for 100 years, 80 years,
[04:22.600 --> 04:24.640]  tens of thousands of them, it's all admitted,
[04:24.640 --> 04:28.760]  but CNN and others say, there's no proof, gaslighting.
[04:28.760 --> 04:30.000]  We're gonna go to break, come back,
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.480]  my one shroyer's gonna be here.
[04:31.480 --> 04:34.000]  I want to comment on Tucker Carlson when he had to say,
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.480]  last night about Sidney Powell and more,
[04:36.480 --> 04:39.640]  but remember, Info Wars is the light of liberty.
[04:39.640 --> 04:41.560]  It's actually exploding under this crisis,
[04:41.560 --> 04:43.360]  as people know with the censorship,
[04:43.360 --> 04:45.760]  the one place to find the real dead on analysis
[04:45.760 --> 04:49.600]  is infowars.com, newswars.com, and banned on video.
[04:49.600 --> 04:51.360]  We'll be right back on the side of this break.
[04:51.360 --> 04:52.680]  Please stay with us, Paul Revere's,
[04:52.680 --> 04:54.120]  and please spread the word.
[04:58.760 --> 05:01.320]  Big Tech is in league with the globalist
[05:01.320 --> 05:03.200]  and the Chai Cops, and is attempting
[05:03.200 --> 05:05.840]  an information too against America.
[05:05.840 --> 05:07.680]  And when we take this country back,
[05:07.680 --> 05:12.680]  they must be held accountable as espionage offers.
[05:12.680 --> 05:15.000]  The games are over, the waiting is over,
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.640]  the fight is now out in the open,
[05:16.640 --> 05:20.280]  world government is here in the latter part of 2020,
[05:20.280 --> 05:22.480]  is attempting to collapse the world economy,
[05:22.480 --> 05:24.200]  set up a global digital currency
[05:24.200 --> 05:26.000]  and AI surveillance system.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.240]  And Info Wars is on the front lines,
[05:28.240 --> 05:29.560]  fighting harder than ever.
[05:29.560 --> 05:31.480]  And we pledge that you should never back down
[05:31.480 --> 05:33.480]  and never give up in the face of this evil,
[05:33.480 --> 05:35.560]  because we know God is watching,
[05:35.560 --> 05:38.640]  and God is in charge, and God is on our side.
[05:38.640 --> 05:40.680]  Info Wars can only stay in the fight
[05:40.680 --> 05:42.240]  and continue to be the tip of the spear
[05:42.240 --> 05:43.760]  if you financially support us
[05:43.760 --> 05:45.600]  by getting great products at the same time
[05:45.600 --> 05:47.080]  at infowarstore.com.
[05:47.080 --> 05:48.880]  And we have one of the biggest sales of the year,
[05:48.880 --> 05:51.880]  about to end up a 60% off triple-patriot points
[05:51.880 --> 05:54.280]  in free shipping with the stop the still special
[05:54.280 --> 05:55.600]  at infowarstore.com.
[06:03.600 --> 06:05.760]  The Alex Jones Show,
[06:05.760 --> 06:08.840]  because there is a war on for your mind.
[06:13.440 --> 06:15.160]  Build back better.
[06:15.160 --> 06:17.880]  The Great Reset, Agenda 21.
[06:18.800 --> 06:19.880]  Welcome, my friends.
[06:21.120 --> 06:25.200]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday broadcast.
[06:25.200 --> 06:27.400]  Alan Schreuer is set to take over
[06:27.400 --> 06:29.600]  from Austin, Texas here in a few minutes.
[06:29.600 --> 06:34.600]  John Kerry has joined the Canadian Prime Minister,
[06:34.600 --> 06:38.720]  the British Prime Minister, the German Chancellor.
[06:38.720 --> 06:41.040]  Oh, and a whole bunch of other European presidents
[06:41.040 --> 06:44.640]  in just the last 24 hours coming out and saying,
[06:44.640 --> 06:49.640]  Kelvin is the Great Reset to make populous nations
[06:50.760 --> 06:54.120]  like the UK with Brexit and the United States
[06:54.120 --> 06:59.120]  be punished for what we did so that we submit to them.
[07:00.280 --> 07:02.520]  Isn't that the most incredible thing ever?
[07:02.520 --> 07:06.560]  Go read the articles with direct links to John Kerry
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.560]  and Justin Trudeau and Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel
[07:11.560 --> 07:15.520]  and two other EU presidents.
[07:15.520 --> 07:16.360]  Go read it.
[07:17.360 --> 07:19.000]  Just last night and today,
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.680]  shooting their demonic, filthy, murdering, scumbag,
[07:23.680 --> 07:24.520]  mouths off.
[07:24.520 --> 07:25.600]  They're attacking us.
[07:25.600 --> 07:27.380]  This is 21st century war.
[07:28.400 --> 07:29.660]  It's called siege.
[07:30.680 --> 07:32.520]  And they've got all these people trained now,
[07:32.520 --> 07:34.520]  10 months into this and never take the mask off
[07:34.520 --> 07:37.200]  and now they're getting ready for lockdown too,
[07:37.200 --> 07:40.040]  that will put us into a depression and kill the third world.
[07:40.040 --> 07:42.520]  They're talking about Great Reset ending poverty.
[07:42.520 --> 07:44.600]  Yeah, well, in poverty, it's killing people.
[07:44.600 --> 07:45.600]  You won't even admit it.
[07:45.600 --> 07:46.840]  The very one's doing it, admit.
[07:46.840 --> 07:48.040]  Give us billions more.
[07:48.040 --> 07:49.600]  So now we got to feed everybody in Africa
[07:49.600 --> 07:50.880]  places that starve to death
[07:50.880 --> 07:52.840]  because they've cut the damn economies off
[07:54.680 --> 07:56.840]  because here you lose your job,
[07:56.840 --> 08:00.040]  you just live on welfare and then end up losing your house.
[08:00.040 --> 08:02.240]  But in places like Africa, you starve to death
[08:02.240 --> 08:04.240]  and that's where we're buying produce.
[08:04.240 --> 08:06.080]  The biggest producers are flowers.
[08:06.080 --> 08:09.000]  All that stuff that is a non-essential economy
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.040]  is essential to them and they die.
[08:11.040 --> 08:13.800]  Think about being called non-essential.
[08:15.000 --> 08:16.240]  But it all hides in plain view
[08:16.240 --> 08:17.920]  with a bunch of simpering leftist
[08:17.920 --> 08:20.600]  because the left in this country, liberals in this country,
[08:20.600 --> 08:22.320]  have totally abandoned all their morals
[08:22.320 --> 08:23.160]  and everything else.
[08:23.160 --> 08:24.840]  And they're also a bunch of useful idiots.
[08:24.840 --> 08:28.720]  The average leftist is even being more severely hurt
[08:28.720 --> 08:30.320]  by the lockdowns and the shutdowns
[08:30.320 --> 08:33.640]  and their cult-like subservience, but they don't care
[08:33.640 --> 08:35.960]  because they think by going along with mainstream media
[08:35.960 --> 08:38.160]  and supporting endless wars and all the corruption
[08:38.160 --> 08:39.760]  that there's somehow the good guys
[08:39.760 --> 08:41.240]  and they're the resistance.
[08:41.240 --> 08:43.800]  You're not woke, you're not the resistance,
[08:43.800 --> 08:45.280]  you're the problem.
[08:45.280 --> 08:47.920]  Now I wanna play a clip of Tucker Carlson
[08:48.960 --> 08:50.800]  talking about Sidney Powell last night,
[08:50.800 --> 08:53.320]  one of the lawyers on Trump's team
[08:53.320 --> 08:55.960]  and the fact that the last week he's requested
[08:55.960 --> 08:59.360]  many, many times that they give him the proof
[08:59.360 --> 09:02.120]  and that she has not given him the proof
[09:02.120 --> 09:07.120]  of the algorithm manipulation that she says is going on.
[09:07.120 --> 09:08.840]  Now I have some comments on this,
[09:08.840 --> 09:11.400]  but first, let's play a few minutes of what Tucker Carlson
[09:11.400 --> 09:14.080]  had to say last night that I'll come back
[09:14.080 --> 09:15.680]  and give you the actual breakdown.
[09:15.680 --> 09:16.840]  Stay with us.
[09:16.840 --> 09:19.000]  By former prosecutor Sidney Powell,
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.680]  who has also served as General Mike Flynn's lawyer.
[09:21.680 --> 09:23.600]  For more than a week, Powell has been all over
[09:23.600 --> 09:26.320]  conservative media with the following story.
[09:26.320 --> 09:28.600]  This election was stolen by a collection
[09:28.600 --> 09:31.040]  of international leftists who manipulated
[09:31.040 --> 09:33.840]  vote tabulating software in order to flip millions
[09:33.840 --> 09:36.280]  of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.
[09:36.280 --> 09:38.880]  The other day on television, Powell said of Trump
[09:38.880 --> 09:41.320]  that when the fraud is finally uncovered, quote,
[09:41.320 --> 09:44.840]  I think we'll find he had at least 80 million votes.
[09:44.840 --> 09:47.320]  In other words, rigged software stole
[09:47.320 --> 09:50.800]  about seven million votes in this election.
[09:50.800 --> 09:53.600]  Here's some of what Powell said today about the software.
[09:54.640 --> 09:56.760]  One of its most characteristic features
[09:56.760 --> 09:59.840]  is its ability to flip votes.
[09:59.840 --> 10:03.440]  It can set and run an algorithm that probably ran
[10:03.440 --> 10:06.200]  all over the country to take a certain percentage
[10:06.200 --> 10:08.240]  of votes from President Trump
[10:08.240 --> 10:10.480]  and flip them to President Biden,
[10:10.480 --> 10:12.560]  which we might never have uncovered
[10:12.560 --> 10:16.200]  had the votes for President Trump not been so overwhelming
[10:16.200 --> 10:20.040]  in so many of these states that it broke the algorithm
[10:20.040 --> 10:22.200]  that had been plugged into the system.
[10:22.200 --> 10:25.000]  And that's what caused them to have to shut down
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.960]  in the states they shut down in.
[10:28.200 --> 10:29.360]  That was a few hours ago,
[10:29.360 --> 10:31.800]  but Sidney Powell has been saying similar things for days.
[10:31.800 --> 10:33.480]  On Sunday night, we texted her
[10:33.480 --> 10:35.400]  after watching one of her segments.
[10:35.400 --> 10:37.400]  What Powell was describing would amount
[10:37.400 --> 10:40.960]  to the single greatest crime in American history.
[10:40.960 --> 10:43.800]  Millions of votes stolen in a day.
[10:43.800 --> 10:47.880]  Democracy destroyed the end of our century's old system
[10:47.880 --> 10:50.440]  of self-government, not a small thing.
[10:50.440 --> 10:54.240]  Now, to be perfectly clear, we did not dismiss any of it.
[10:54.240 --> 10:56.440]  We don't dismiss anything anymore,
[10:56.440 --> 10:58.600]  particularly when it's related to technology.
[10:58.600 --> 11:00.960]  We've talked to too many Silicon Valley whistleblowers.
[11:00.960 --> 11:02.840]  We've seen too much.
[11:02.840 --> 11:06.320]  After four years, this may be the single most open-minded show
[11:06.320 --> 11:07.320]  on television.
[11:07.320 --> 11:10.120]  We literally do UFO segments,
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.360]  not because we're crazy or it even been interested
[11:12.360 --> 11:14.880]  in the subject, but because there is evidence
[11:14.880 --> 11:18.120]  that UFOs are real and everyone lies about it.
[11:18.120 --> 11:19.640]  There's evidence that a lot of things,
[11:19.640 --> 11:22.040]  that responsible people used to dismiss out of hand
[11:22.040 --> 11:24.320]  as ridiculous, are in fact real.
[11:24.320 --> 11:26.360]  And we don't care who mocks it.
[11:26.360 --> 11:28.720]  The louder the Yale Political Science Department
[11:28.720 --> 11:30.320]  and the staff of the Atlantic Magazine
[11:30.320 --> 11:32.520]  scream conspiracy theory,
[11:32.520 --> 11:34.760]  the more interested we tend to be.
[11:34.760 --> 11:37.080]  That's usually a sign you're over the target.
[11:37.080 --> 11:39.200]  A lot of people with impressive sounding credentials
[11:39.200 --> 11:40.920]  in this country are frauds.
[11:40.920 --> 11:42.720]  They have no idea what they're doing.
[11:42.720 --> 11:44.840]  They're children posing as authorities
[11:44.840 --> 11:46.200]  and when they're caught, they lie
[11:46.200 --> 11:48.120]  and then they blame you for it.
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.160]  We see that every day.
[11:49.160 --> 11:51.000]  It's the central theme of this show
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.040]  and will continue to be.
[11:53.040 --> 11:54.200]  So that's a long way of saying,
[11:54.200 --> 11:55.760]  we took Sidney Powell seriously.
[11:55.760 --> 11:57.080]  We had no intention of fighting with her.
[11:57.080 --> 11:58.720]  We've always respected her work.
[11:58.720 --> 12:00.360]  We simply wanted to see the details.
[12:00.360 --> 12:02.520]  How could you not want to see them?
[12:02.520 --> 12:04.280]  So we invited Sidney Powell on this show.
[12:04.280 --> 12:05.880]  We would have given her the whole hour.
[12:05.880 --> 12:07.960]  We would have given her the entire week actually
[12:07.960 --> 12:11.600]  and listened quietly the whole time at rap detention.
[12:11.600 --> 12:12.840]  That's a big story.
[12:13.800 --> 12:15.680]  But she never sent us any evidence
[12:15.680 --> 12:19.400]  despite a lot of requests, polite requests, not a page.
[12:19.400 --> 12:21.040]  When we kept pressing, she got angry
[12:21.040 --> 12:23.280]  and told us to stop contacting her.
[12:23.280 --> 12:25.440]  When we checked with others around the Trump campaign,
[12:25.440 --> 12:27.640]  people in positions of authority, they told us,
[12:27.640 --> 12:30.360]  Powell has never given them any evidence either,
[12:30.360 --> 12:33.640]  nor did she provide any today at the press conference.
[12:33.640 --> 12:35.960]  Powell did say that electronic voting is dangerous
[12:35.960 --> 12:37.960]  and she's right, we're with her there.
[12:37.960 --> 12:40.880]  But she never demonstrated that a single actual vote
[12:40.880 --> 12:43.400]  was moved illegitimately by software
[12:43.400 --> 12:45.640]  from one candidate to another, not one.
[12:46.760 --> 12:48.520]  So why are we telling you this?
[12:48.520 --> 12:51.600]  We're telling you this because it's true.
[12:51.600 --> 12:55.000]  And in the end, that's all that matters, the truth.
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.800]  It's our only hope, it's our best defense.
[12:58.800 --> 13:01.120]  And it's how we're different from them.
[13:01.120 --> 13:04.840]  We care what's true and we know you care too.
[13:04.840 --> 13:06.880]  That's why we told you.
[13:06.880 --> 13:09.080]  Maybe Sidney Powell will come forward soon with details
[13:09.080 --> 13:12.520]  on exactly how this happened and precisely who did it.
[13:12.520 --> 13:16.200]  Maybe she will, we are certainly hopeful that she will.
[13:16.200 --> 13:18.960]  What happened with the vote counting this month
[13:18.960 --> 13:20.600]  and at the polling places in Detroit
[13:20.600 --> 13:22.120]  and the polling places in Philadelphia
[13:22.120 --> 13:25.460]  and so much else actually matters.
[13:26.600 --> 13:28.200]  It matters no matter who you voted for,
[13:28.200 --> 13:29.280]  it matters whether or not you think
[13:29.280 --> 13:31.000]  the selection is already over.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.600]  Until we know the answers to those questions conclusively
[13:33.600 --> 13:36.960]  and we can agree on them, this country will not be united.
[13:38.640 --> 13:39.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.160]  that was Tucker Carlson last night,
[13:43.160 --> 13:48.160]  the number one rated show on prime time news television.
[13:49.240 --> 13:51.440]  When we come back from this upcoming break,
[13:51.440 --> 13:54.200]  Alex Jones is going to dive deeper
[13:54.200 --> 13:56.080]  into what all of this means
[13:57.040 --> 13:59.880]  and of course the electronic voting machines
[13:59.880 --> 14:02.120]  and the evidence that Sidney Powell
[14:02.120 --> 14:04.120]  is going to have to come up with
[14:05.560 --> 14:08.200]  and then some of the behind the scenes stuff
[14:08.200 --> 14:09.600]  that's going on.
[14:10.680 --> 14:13.920]  I think quite frankly, and I've been saying this,
[14:13.920 --> 14:15.720]  this is gonna be the toughest legal challenge
[14:15.720 --> 14:18.560]  for Trump's team and it's gonna be proving
[14:18.560 --> 14:20.960]  that the voting machines were rigged.
[14:20.960 --> 14:25.960]  And you already have Dominion backing out of testifying
[14:26.880 --> 14:28.720]  in Pennsylvania today.
[14:29.800 --> 14:31.120]  The headline on the Gateway Pundit is
[14:31.120 --> 14:34.800]  Dominion Voting System backs out from testifying
[14:34.800 --> 14:36.880]  before Pennsylvania State House Committee.
[14:36.880 --> 14:38.720]  What are they hiding?
[14:38.720 --> 14:41.020]  The Pennsylvania House Republicans made a statement,
[14:41.020 --> 14:44.200]  Representative Don Kiefer, 14 counties
[14:44.200 --> 14:46.280]  use the Dominion Voting System software.
[14:46.280 --> 14:48.480]  We trust the workers in our polling places
[14:48.480 --> 14:51.080]  and in our counties, but what we don't know
[14:51.080 --> 14:53.440]  is the role of third party companies
[14:53.440 --> 14:56.320]  and when they rescind their participation in our hearing
[14:56.320 --> 14:58.540]  we're left wondering why.
[14:59.880 --> 15:01.880]  And so they're recounting in Wisconsin,
[15:01.880 --> 15:03.080]  they're recounting in Georgia,
[15:03.080 --> 15:05.920]  but they're recounting the fake votes
[15:05.920 --> 15:09.040]  and you can't recount votes that are just
[15:10.300 --> 15:15.300]  numbers and data on a computer, on a database,
[15:15.300 --> 15:18.540]  and you don't actually have a paper record.
[15:18.540 --> 15:21.020]  So this is a near impossible challenge.
[15:21.860 --> 15:23.700]  These rigged voting machines have been used
[15:23.700 --> 15:25.100]  around the world for decades.
[15:25.100 --> 15:26.620]  They've mastered their craft.
[15:27.860 --> 15:31.260]  Can Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis,
[15:31.260 --> 15:36.020]  Joe DeGeneva, Lynn Wood and others slay this beast,
[15:36.020 --> 15:38.260]  slay these rigged elections that happen worldwide
[15:38.260 --> 15:41.320]  with Dominion Voting Systems and SmartMatic.
[15:41.320 --> 15:46.320]  This is a final level battle for the United States
[15:46.320 --> 15:51.280]  of America, for democracy, and for our republic.
[15:51.280 --> 15:53.840]  And Alex Jones breaks it all down
[15:53.840 --> 15:55.640]  on the other side of this short break.
[15:56.640 --> 15:58.760]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now
[15:58.760 --> 16:01.400]  by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America,
[16:01.400 --> 16:03.320]  JPMorgan Chase, Coleman Sacks.
[16:03.320 --> 16:05.400]  They're saying that the COVID virus
[16:05.400 --> 16:07.280]  is going to cause a global depression
[16:07.280 --> 16:09.240]  and hundreds of millions to start the death.
[16:09.240 --> 16:12.040]  Incredible, they're the very organizations
[16:12.040 --> 16:14.200]  that ordered the global lockdowns
[16:14.200 --> 16:16.000]  that are causing the chain reaction
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.400]  that's causing the mass starvation, not the COVID virus.
[16:19.400 --> 16:20.560]  That is a fact.
[16:20.560 --> 16:22.840]  And all the hero's sheep, where the masks
[16:22.840 --> 16:25.000]  can go along with this, are signing on
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.720]  to mass murder bigger than what Hitler did.
[16:27.720 --> 16:29.600]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention
[16:29.600 --> 16:31.160]  and the Nuremberg Code.
[16:31.160 --> 16:34.040]  This is a medical, world government,
[16:34.040 --> 16:36.600]  tyrannical takeover, causing starvation,
[16:36.600 --> 16:40.040]  setting up world IDs, and coming with forced inoculations.
[16:40.040 --> 16:42.640]  And now Bank of America says global unrest
[16:42.640 --> 16:45.160]  is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[16:45.160 --> 16:46.920]  That story's on infowars.com.
[16:46.920 --> 16:49.480]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public
[16:49.480 --> 16:51.160]  and to say you're not stand for this
[16:51.160 --> 16:53.320]  or the mass global genocide being caused
[16:53.320 --> 16:55.400]  by the planetary great reset.
[16:56.520 --> 16:58.080]  Alex Jones here with an important message
[16:58.080 --> 16:59.200]  to all of our listeners and viewers.
[16:59.200 --> 17:00.600]  I want to thank you for your support over the years.
[17:00.600 --> 17:03.040]  I want to thank you for having skin in the game
[17:03.040 --> 17:06.360]  and no one has had more skin in the game than our president.
[17:06.360 --> 17:07.400]  And he needs our prayers.
[17:07.400 --> 17:08.360]  He needs our support.
[17:08.360 --> 17:10.160]  He is the president.
[17:10.160 --> 17:11.960]  Secretary of State Pompeo understands
[17:11.960 --> 17:13.440]  that's why he said yesterday
[17:13.440 --> 17:15.520]  there will be a smooth transition
[17:15.520 --> 17:17.080]  from this Trump administration
[17:17.080 --> 17:18.880]  into the next Trump administration.
[17:18.880 --> 17:21.400]  Because in all the major states
[17:21.400 --> 17:24.160]  where they're still counting, they are gaining ground.
[17:24.160 --> 17:26.560]  That is President Trump, Republican Party,
[17:26.560 --> 17:28.920]  the American people, the populace, the patriots,
[17:28.920 --> 17:31.720]  the enemy, the Democrats, back by the Chi-Coms,
[17:31.720 --> 17:33.800]  backed by the European Union, back by Hollywood,
[17:33.800 --> 17:36.280]  back by the left, the blue cities, the blue states.
[17:36.280 --> 17:39.080]  They are in a rage trying to gaslight us,
[17:39.080 --> 17:40.960]  keep calling Biden President-elect.
[17:40.960 --> 17:41.800]  He's not.
[17:41.800 --> 17:43.040]  The president has to concede
[17:43.040 --> 17:46.040]  and or all of the states have to certify the vote,
[17:46.040 --> 17:47.080]  which hasn't happened yet.
[17:47.080 --> 17:48.960]  And then you have to have the electors
[17:48.960 --> 17:51.360]  to seek who is going to be the president.
[17:51.360 --> 17:53.520]  And this may be a dispute that goes back to the states.
[17:53.520 --> 17:54.960]  That's why it's in the Constitution
[17:54.960 --> 17:56.560]  and the Constitution's kicking in.
[17:56.560 --> 18:03.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:20.240 --> 18:24.240]  Very strong words from Tucker Carlson about Sidney Powell.
[18:24.240 --> 18:26.560]  First, let's just say I've been friends with Tucker Carlson
[18:26.560 --> 18:27.560]  for 10 years.
[18:27.560 --> 18:28.640]  He listens to my show.
[18:28.640 --> 18:30.080]  I listen to his show.
[18:30.080 --> 18:33.000]  I think he's got some of the best guests, the best analysis,
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.520]  the most courage of anybody on Main Street television
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.080]  or even radio, for that matter, other than InfoWars.
[18:39.080 --> 18:42.360]  And I understand why he's frustrated with Sidney Powell
[18:42.360 --> 18:44.920]  on the Trump-Spanish lawyers looking into fraud,
[18:44.920 --> 18:48.400]  because he offered her the whole show, 45 minutes of airtime,
[18:48.400 --> 18:50.960]  minusing the commercials.
[18:50.960 --> 18:54.080]  As he responded back, oh, I can't just go in for five minutes.
[18:54.080 --> 18:56.840]  I would need more time to present my truth.
[18:56.840 --> 19:01.440]  I'm too busy investigating what's going on.
[19:01.440 --> 19:03.040]  Well, here's the problem with that.
[19:03.040 --> 19:04.800]  He did offer you an hour.
[19:04.800 --> 19:06.360]  And the press conference you did didn't
[19:06.360 --> 19:08.600]  get covered by the media because they're shutting you out.
[19:08.600 --> 19:10.600]  You would have had one of the biggest audiences in media
[19:10.600 --> 19:14.480]  out there for you and Giuliani to go on his show.
[19:14.480 --> 19:16.400]  All you have to do is provide him
[19:16.400 --> 19:18.800]  with the proof of the algorithm.
[19:18.800 --> 19:23.080]  Now, that said, there is proof of the algorithm.
[19:23.080 --> 19:26.600]  The problem is Sidney Powell is not a mathematician.
[19:26.600 --> 19:28.240]  She's not a software engineer.
[19:28.240 --> 19:29.800]  She's not a statistician.
[19:29.800 --> 19:32.000]  And there are a whole group, four different groups.
[19:32.000 --> 19:33.680]  I've talked to Trump's lawyers, people
[19:33.680 --> 19:36.040]  that are out here in Georgia, high level.
[19:36.040 --> 19:37.840]  There are four corporate groups that
[19:37.840 --> 19:42.040]  have scanned and looked at the vote anomalies in Michigan
[19:42.040 --> 19:44.520]  and Pennsylvania and Georgia and several other states.
[19:44.520 --> 19:48.400]  And it is basically the exact same shaving of numbers
[19:48.400 --> 19:52.600]  and manipulation that is statistically impossible.
[19:52.600 --> 19:55.000]  They simply need to present the information
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.160]  that those groups have garnered the software engineers have
[19:57.160 --> 19:59.280]  found and give it to Tucker Carlson.
[19:59.280 --> 20:01.440]  Anyone with their own eyeball can
[20:01.440 --> 20:03.480]  see that as soon as they close the polls,
[20:03.480 --> 20:07.200]  prematurely, in Georgia, in Michigan, other areas,
[20:07.200 --> 20:10.880]  that instead of a organic circle or curve,
[20:10.880 --> 20:14.120]  it went straight up for Biden, all those states.
[20:14.120 --> 20:17.160]  So that's what the computers are picking up.
[20:17.160 --> 20:21.200]  And I've interviewed Bev Harris and all the other experts
[20:21.200 --> 20:23.760]  about Dominion, about all these software companies
[20:23.760 --> 20:25.280]  that have been banned in most states.
[20:25.280 --> 20:27.640]  My god, it's famous how they've been caught.
[20:27.640 --> 20:29.920]  It's famous how they put patches on the day
[20:29.920 --> 20:32.840]  before the election and weird grips for breaking in.
[20:32.840 --> 20:35.680]  But it's so complex that judges don't understand it.
[20:35.680 --> 20:37.160]  The general public doesn't understand it.
[20:37.160 --> 20:39.280]  And lawyers like Powell doesn't understand it.
[20:39.280 --> 20:43.320]  They're sitting there, collating this and going over it.
[20:43.320 --> 20:46.080]  And they're waiting too long to present it.
[20:46.080 --> 20:48.760]  It needs to be given as the raw data to people
[20:48.760 --> 20:51.040]  like Tucker Carlson, myself, and others.
[20:51.040 --> 20:53.280]  Now, I'll give you another wrinkle in this.
[20:53.280 --> 20:54.560]  I was talking to one of the top lawyers
[20:54.560 --> 20:56.040]  that speaks to Trump daily.
[20:56.040 --> 20:58.800]  Trump has agreed for over a week that trying to go
[20:58.800 --> 21:02.560]  after algorithms and the voting machines is something
[21:02.560 --> 21:04.120]  that the public just doesn't understand.
[21:04.120 --> 21:05.920]  But what we do understand is law
[21:05.920 --> 21:08.360]  about signature verification.
[21:08.360 --> 21:09.880]  Now, you've got to have signature verification
[21:09.880 --> 21:12.760]  if you show up in person, but not supposedly,
[21:12.760 --> 21:14.440]  according to these agreements that were made by governors
[21:14.440 --> 21:19.440]  outside of law, outside of legislature, in the states.
[21:19.440 --> 21:21.760]  And so in Georgia and other areas,
[21:21.760 --> 21:23.160]  they weren't verifying the signatures.
[21:23.160 --> 21:24.840]  They weren't even looking at them.
[21:24.840 --> 21:26.840]  That's the violation of law.
[21:26.840 --> 21:30.160]  And bare metal, there needs to be a new election
[21:30.160 --> 21:32.080]  in the six states that showed the anomaly.
[21:32.080 --> 21:34.160]  Hell, it needs to be in California too.
[21:34.160 --> 21:37.480]  Judge Rould Newsom illegally said a mail-in ballot
[21:37.480 --> 21:39.200]  had to be 100% in many counties
[21:39.200 --> 21:41.480]  and said that signatures could be waived.
[21:41.480 --> 21:42.960]  So that's the reality.
[21:42.960 --> 21:45.600]  And I understand Tucker Carlson's frustration.
[21:45.600 --> 21:47.960]  And I understand him putting Powell on the spot.
[21:47.960 --> 21:50.840]  And Powell's response is not good.
[21:50.840 --> 21:52.360]  But let me tell you, there is evidence
[21:52.360 --> 21:53.600]  with the algorithms.
[21:53.600 --> 21:55.720]  It is a reality and it is a fact.
[21:55.720 --> 21:57.160]  So we'll be covering all this more today.
[21:57.160 --> 21:58.840]  I was just at the Georgia Guidestones.
[21:58.840 --> 22:01.560]  We taped a report that'll be aired later in the show.
[22:01.560 --> 22:02.800]  Owen Schroder is about to take over
[22:02.800 --> 22:05.560]  with all the latest news on the other side of this break.
[22:05.560 --> 22:07.240]  I want to thank you all for your support and your prayers
[22:07.240 --> 22:09.680]  because regardless, we're going to continue
[22:09.680 --> 22:10.920]  fighting the globalist takeover.
[22:10.920 --> 22:13.400]  This is America under war, a new type of war,
[22:13.400 --> 22:15.640]  a globalist corporate chai-com war.
[22:15.640 --> 22:17.040]  And the sooner people figure that out,
[22:17.040 --> 22:18.560]  the better we're going to be able to turn this around.
[22:18.560 --> 22:20.000]  Because it's only going to get worse
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.560]  until people wake up and stop complying
[22:22.560 --> 22:25.320]  with the overblown hoax that is COVID-19,
[22:25.320 --> 22:28.720]  top epidemiologist coming out saying it's basically not
[22:28.720 --> 22:31.360]  even as bad as the flu, that it's hysteria,
[22:31.360 --> 22:33.600]  that it's going to kill tens of millions of starvation.
[22:33.600 --> 22:35.400]  All of that is now confirmed.
[22:35.400 --> 22:37.440]  And the globalists on the left admit
[22:37.440 --> 22:40.720]  that they are punishing populist and nationalist countries
[22:40.720 --> 22:43.280]  with this for daring to try to be free.
[22:43.280 --> 22:45.400]  Just like the British put us under blockades
[22:45.400 --> 22:48.160]  in our Revolutionary War, the same damn thing's happening.
[22:48.160 --> 22:49.960]  As long as we recognize this is an attack
[22:49.960 --> 22:52.360]  and resist it and say no, we will win.
[22:52.360 --> 22:54.040]  If we roll over, we'll be slaves.
[22:54.040 --> 22:58.640]  Back to Owen Schroer and a live broadcast on 1120, 2020.
[22:59.760 --> 23:03.280]  Let's real quickly go to Sidney Powell's response
[23:03.280 --> 23:05.600]  with Maria Bartaromo this morning.
[23:07.720 --> 23:09.880]  All right, Sidney, I want you to respond
[23:09.880 --> 23:12.160]  to what Tucker Carlson said last night, Sidney.
[23:12.160 --> 23:13.320]  I don't know if you watched it,
[23:13.320 --> 23:17.720]  but Tucker Carlson said that he had invited you
[23:17.720 --> 23:19.680]  on his show to share evidence
[23:19.680 --> 23:22.960]  of the software flipping votes.
[23:22.960 --> 23:27.640]  And he said you got angry and refused to provide evidence
[23:27.640 --> 23:31.600]  for your claims of voting software flipping votes.
[23:31.600 --> 23:33.560]  How do you respond to Tucker Carlson?
[23:33.560 --> 23:35.000]  Did you get angry with the show
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.960]  because they texted you and asked you
[23:36.960 --> 23:39.880]  to please provide evidence of what you're alleging?
[23:39.880 --> 23:43.480]  No, I didn't get angry with the request to provide evidence.
[23:43.480 --> 23:46.400]  In fact, I sent an affidavit to Tucker
[23:46.400 --> 23:50.360]  that I had not even attached to a pleading yet
[23:50.360 --> 23:52.680]  to help him understand the situation.
[23:52.680 --> 23:54.400]  And I offered him another witness
[23:54.400 --> 23:56.440]  who could explain the mathematics
[23:56.440 --> 23:59.480]  and statistical evidence far better than I can.
[23:59.480 --> 24:01.720]  I'm not really a numbers person,
[24:01.720 --> 24:04.760]  but he was very insulting, demanding and rude.
[24:04.760 --> 24:08.360]  And I told him not to contact me again
[24:08.360 --> 24:09.960]  in those terms.
[24:11.960 --> 24:15.000]  Now, quite frankly, I think that this is irrelevant
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.640]  and maybe even a little bit petty bickering
[24:17.640 --> 24:18.840]  that's happening here.
[24:21.600 --> 24:24.080]  I don't understand why Sidney Powell
[24:24.080 --> 24:26.880]  would reveal her evidence, quite frankly.
[24:26.880 --> 24:29.400]  Why would Sidney Powell reveal all of her evidence
[24:29.400 --> 24:30.880]  before it gets to court?
[24:30.880 --> 24:32.280]  I don't know a single lawyer
[24:32.280 --> 24:33.920]  that's getting ready for a major court battle
[24:33.920 --> 24:37.160]  that would do that and then give the defense
[24:37.160 --> 24:42.160]  a chance to preemptively respond
[24:42.680 --> 24:44.520]  or prepare an argument against the evidence
[24:44.520 --> 24:45.480]  you're about to bring forward.
[24:45.480 --> 24:47.800]  So I don't understand that.
[24:47.800 --> 24:52.520]  And Sidney Powell has actually provided tons of evidence,
[24:52.520 --> 24:54.360]  many which is available to the public
[24:54.360 --> 24:55.960]  and then about 10 sworn affidavits
[24:55.960 --> 24:57.240]  of people swearing to what she's saying.
[24:57.240 --> 24:59.720]  So I don't know why she would reveal her evidence
[24:59.720 --> 25:01.320]  before the court.
[25:01.320 --> 25:02.720]  It gets to the Supreme Court potentially.
[25:02.720 --> 25:05.960]  So I don't really understand that.
[25:05.960 --> 25:09.360]  A couple other anecdotal pieces of information here
[25:09.360 --> 25:12.440]  before we come back and are rejoined by Alex Jones.
[25:12.440 --> 25:15.920]  In 2012, President Trump tweeted out
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.320]  that he believes the voting machines were rigged
[25:19.320 --> 25:22.200]  and were flipping votes from Romney to Obama.
[25:22.200 --> 25:23.480]  So Trump is known about this.
[25:23.480 --> 25:25.800]  This has been on Trump's radar.
[25:25.800 --> 25:28.080]  Now, whether he thinks that that is the biggest thing
[25:28.080 --> 25:30.880]  to look at or signatures or the mail-in ballots
[25:30.880 --> 25:34.640]  or all of it, we know all the different angles
[25:34.640 --> 25:36.680]  that they're using for the theft.
[25:36.680 --> 25:39.800]  I think the voting machines have to be target number one.
[25:40.840 --> 25:43.320]  I don't think they can even get enough mail-in ballots
[25:43.320 --> 25:44.800]  with fake signatures to beat Trump.
[25:44.800 --> 25:47.000]  They needed the electronic voting machines.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.520]  They needed those rig jobs.
[25:49.440 --> 25:52.400]  So I think that's target number one.
[25:52.400 --> 25:53.360]  Now be careful.
[25:54.560 --> 25:58.120]  These stories that are surfacing about seizures
[25:58.120 --> 26:02.040]  of hard drives in Germany that are allegedly,
[26:02.040 --> 26:05.280]  I guess it's called CIDL, that are harboring information
[26:05.280 --> 26:07.040]  that gets transferred, harboring vote data
[26:07.040 --> 26:08.720]  that gets transferred in the voting process
[26:08.720 --> 26:10.080]  from America to Germany to Spain.
[26:10.080 --> 26:11.760]  And then I guess back to America for the results.
[26:11.760 --> 26:12.720]  Very suspicious.
[26:13.680 --> 26:15.180]  Be very weary.
[26:16.080 --> 26:19.960]  Be very weary about this story
[26:22.320 --> 26:25.080]  claiming that the FBI or someone went in
[26:25.080 --> 26:27.040]  and rated those servers.
[26:27.040 --> 26:28.840]  Let me tell you something right now.
[26:28.840 --> 26:32.640]  If it was the FBI or the CIA, it's game over.
[26:32.640 --> 26:34.800]  They've got the evidence, it's gone.
[26:34.800 --> 26:36.280]  Forget about it.
[26:36.280 --> 26:38.720]  The FBI is not on our side.
[26:38.720 --> 26:41.160]  The CIA is not on our side.
[26:41.160 --> 26:43.120]  I'm debating whether the Department of Justice
[26:43.120 --> 26:43.960]  is on our side.
[26:43.960 --> 26:47.400]  So if the CIA or the FBI or someone actually went in there
[26:47.400 --> 26:51.080]  and got those hard drives, it's gone, folks.
[26:51.080 --> 26:52.240]  It's gone.
[26:52.240 --> 26:53.960]  That's not a good thing.
[26:53.960 --> 26:55.200]  Alex Jones on the other side.
[26:55.200 --> 26:57.560]  Warning, warning, warning.
[26:57.560 --> 27:00.520]  There is not long to stop the complete
[27:00.520 --> 27:02.680]  martial law takeover.
[27:02.680 --> 27:04.600]  The giant third world collapse
[27:04.600 --> 27:06.800]  and a new world war that is gonna be triggered
[27:06.800 --> 27:10.440]  by the new COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems
[27:10.440 --> 27:14.080]  in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United States.
[27:14.080 --> 27:16.920]  Joe Biden is set to announce today
[27:16.920 --> 27:19.320]  that he has a new COVID task force
[27:19.320 --> 27:21.640]  that is calling for a national mask mandate
[27:21.640 --> 27:24.440]  to prove your servitude, contact tracing,
[27:24.440 --> 27:26.200]  forced inoculations coming,
[27:26.200 --> 27:29.640]  but most importantly, a new lockdown.
[27:29.640 --> 27:32.800]  That way, he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.960]  and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID.
[27:36.960 --> 27:39.480]  Then, of course, when that new lockdown doesn't work,
[27:39.480 --> 27:41.760]  those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown
[27:41.760 --> 27:42.920]  are gonna be blamed for it,
[27:42.920 --> 27:45.440]  and that's when all the mass arrests start sometime
[27:45.440 --> 27:47.120]  towards the end of next year.
[27:47.120 --> 27:49.680]  This is a permanent martial law plan.
[27:49.680 --> 27:52.360]  Trump must be putiated, exposed to how she engaged,
[27:52.360 --> 27:55.520]  and the UN takeover, not play games with it.
[27:55.520 --> 27:57.400]  Two infowars best selling products
[27:57.400 --> 28:00.000]  are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.480]  Biotree Selenium from the mustard seed,
[28:02.480 --> 28:05.320]  essential in all electrochemical activity of the cells
[28:05.320 --> 28:07.960]  in the body, that's every human activity,
[28:07.960 --> 28:11.400]  and on top of it, body's ultimate turmeric formula
[28:11.400 --> 28:13.600]  with 95% or synchicuminoid.
[28:13.600 --> 28:16.400]  When you competitors have three to 5%,
[28:16.400 --> 28:19.040]  the things that turmeric does, I don't have to tell you,
[28:19.040 --> 28:21.520]  this is the highest quality, the strongest you're gonna find.
[28:21.520 --> 28:23.480]  So both of these are amazing products,
[28:23.480 --> 28:25.000]  and they fund the infowar,
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.520]  which is a 360 win.
[28:26.520 --> 28:28.960]  On top of it, despite the fact they're in demand,
[28:28.960 --> 28:30.200]  they've been sold out for months,
[28:30.200 --> 28:34.520]  they're both 50% off, triple Patriot points,

[29:20.800 --> 29:23.040]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.200]  I suggest Band Dot Video.
[29:25.200 --> 29:28.560]  You will now have Band Dot Video app on your home screen,
[29:28.560 --> 29:30.640]  despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[29:30.640 --> 29:32.160]  The globalists think you're lazy,
[29:32.160 --> 29:33.520]  but by taking a little bit of action,
[29:33.520 --> 29:35.920]  you can override them, have the app,
[29:35.920 --> 29:39.040]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[29:39.040 --> 29:41.480]  So it's up to you whether you wanted to find big tech,

[29:52.800 --> 30:18.800]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[30:18.800 --> 30:23.280]  Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[30:23.280 --> 30:24.960]  You want to stop tyranny?
[30:24.960 --> 30:26.600]  Well, so does he.
[30:26.600 --> 30:35.600]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[30:35.680 --> 30:38.080]  It's a very important article on Infowars.com
[30:38.080 --> 30:40.520]  that everyone needs to read.
[30:40.520 --> 30:42.480]  It's about sleepy Joe Biden.
[30:42.480 --> 30:47.320]  Biden claims support for national shutdown was hypothetical,
[30:47.320 --> 30:50.160]  just like shutting down fracking and oil and gas
[30:50.160 --> 30:53.400]  was hypothetical, even though Obama basically did that.
[30:53.400 --> 30:55.320]  And now he's saying, oh, he didn't mean it when he said,
[30:55.320 --> 30:57.440]  he'd, quote, listen to the scientists
[30:57.440 --> 30:59.080]  if they said it and shut it down.
[30:59.080 --> 31:01.280]  He says, he's going to shut some things down,
[31:01.280 --> 31:03.440]  but it's going to be calibrated so that he
[31:03.440 --> 31:06.360]  can shut the virus down.
[31:06.360 --> 31:07.840]  That's called doublespeak.
[31:07.840 --> 31:10.600]  The globalists want to shut us down, to bankrupt us,
[31:10.600 --> 31:12.360]  to get us into debt, to control us.
[31:12.360 --> 31:14.120]  And when everybody on welfare, that's
[31:14.120 --> 31:16.720]  their stated cloud pivot plan.
[31:16.720 --> 31:18.960]  And now, they know Trump is a conceiting.
[31:18.960 --> 31:20.680]  They know the evidence of frauds coming out.
[31:20.680 --> 31:23.600]  They know Americans know that he's totally unpopular,
[31:23.600 --> 31:26.800]  AKA Biden, and that the fact that they understand
[31:26.800 --> 31:30.280]  he plans to put us back under total lockdown
[31:30.280 --> 31:33.880]  is energizing the public to resist that much more.
[31:33.880 --> 31:38.640]  And that's why Biden is so incredibly concerned.
[31:38.640 --> 31:40.800]  And that's why it's so important that you tell everyone
[31:40.800 --> 31:44.440]  you know that they now admit the great reset and build back
[31:44.440 --> 31:49.880]  better is an admitted UN, global government, IMF,
[31:49.880 --> 31:54.560]  World Bank plan to selectively shut down Western nations
[31:54.560 --> 31:57.080]  so communist China can be dominant and the Western
[31:57.080 --> 31:59.040]  companies that have invested in China
[31:59.040 --> 32:01.560]  will be able to take over the world markets.
[32:01.560 --> 32:04.480]  This is a power grab, a vertical integration,
[32:04.480 --> 32:07.720]  a depopulation operation, and it is war.
[32:07.720 --> 32:10.120]  Repeat, this is war.
[32:10.120 --> 32:11.400]  This is discrimination.
[32:11.400 --> 32:12.720]  This is out of control.
[32:12.720 --> 32:14.200]  This is fraud.
[32:14.200 --> 32:16.360]  Go read it for yourself.
[32:16.360 --> 32:19.280]  Joe Biden couldn't get elected to the school board.
[32:19.280 --> 32:21.400]  Joe Biden's been a failure his whole life.
[32:21.400 --> 32:23.600]  Joe Biden has been a scam artist his whole life.
[32:23.600 --> 32:25.800]  Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent
[32:25.800 --> 32:27.680]  and has been caught on record.
[32:27.680 --> 32:29.800]  Even if he won the election, which he clearly didn't,
[32:29.800 --> 32:31.280]  he is illegitimate.
[32:31.280 --> 32:34.520]  They said Trump was a Russian agent with no proof
[32:34.520 --> 32:36.080]  and tried to remove him.
[32:36.080 --> 32:37.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, then he said
[32:37.480 --> 32:39.480]  that he was meddling in Ukraine illegally.
[32:39.480 --> 32:40.360]  He wasn't.
[32:40.360 --> 32:44.280]  We have Joe Biden and his son on the Chinese communist payroll.
[32:44.280 --> 32:46.640]  We have them with the electronic voting machines
[32:46.640 --> 32:48.760]  and the massive algorithmic fraud
[32:48.760 --> 32:50.640]  that does show up in all the numbers.
[32:50.640 --> 32:53.920]  And there's no way this person can be seen as the president.
[32:53.920 --> 32:55.400]  The globalists are arrogant.
[32:55.400 --> 32:57.600]  They're disconnected and they have bitten off
[32:57.600 --> 32:59.280]  more than they can chew.
[32:59.280 --> 33:00.800]  Back to Owen Shroyer.
[33:00.800 --> 33:03.120]  I'll be reporting live from the Capitol
[33:03.120 --> 33:05.360]  coming up here in Georgia as we battle
[33:05.360 --> 33:07.280]  to try to stop the governor from certifying
[33:07.280 --> 33:08.440]  the fraudulent election.
[33:08.440 --> 33:10.600]  You already heard it's been certified, it's not true.
[33:10.600 --> 33:13.520]  The state level that re-ran the tabulation,
[33:13.520 --> 33:15.400]  running the same scam over again,
[33:15.400 --> 33:17.040]  has said it's certified.
[33:17.040 --> 33:19.960]  He really found a bunch of new votes for Trump.
[33:19.960 --> 33:22.280]  We're calling for the legislature to be called in
[33:22.280 --> 33:23.680]  to do a real investigation.
[33:23.680 --> 33:25.280]  That's the constitutional angle
[33:25.280 --> 33:27.800]  and Trump's also moving to get the legislature
[33:27.800 --> 33:28.760]  of Michigan to do it.
[33:28.760 --> 33:31.440]  And they've come out and said they found massive fraud
[33:31.440 --> 33:32.440]  at the Detroit level
[33:32.440 --> 33:34.720]  and they have hundreds and hundreds of affidavits
[33:34.720 --> 33:36.160]  in dozens of counties.
[33:36.160 --> 33:38.880]  It's absolutely insane, they locked them up.
[33:38.880 --> 33:43.320]  They kicked the watchers out from Georgia to Pennsylvania
[33:43.320 --> 33:44.160]  to Michigan.
[33:44.160 --> 33:46.640]  This is so incredibly obvious,
[33:46.640 --> 33:48.000]  just like all the other frauds,
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.680]  all the other scams that the globalists have run.
[33:50.680 --> 33:52.840]  And now they're so desperate to legitimize
[33:52.840 --> 33:55.040]  the mainstream media, to legitimize the Democrats
[33:55.040 --> 33:57.400]  to protect themselves from the prosecution
[33:57.400 --> 33:59.160]  they would go under for selling America out,
[33:59.160 --> 34:04.160]  not just Biden, but Obama and the Bushes and the Clintons.
[34:04.160 --> 34:06.520]  That's why the whole power structure's been endorsing
[34:06.520 --> 34:08.760]  Joe Biden and the foreign corporations
[34:08.760 --> 34:11.400]  and the communist Chinese because they're the establishment
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.520]  and Trump and the American people together are the resistance.
[34:17.480 --> 34:20.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back into the Info Wars
[34:20.040 --> 34:22.360]  world headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[34:22.360 --> 34:25.440]  Alex Jones is on the road in Atlanta, Georgia.
[34:25.440 --> 34:27.120]  He will be at the state capitol.
[34:27.120 --> 34:31.560]  In fact, I believe he's at the state capitol right now.
[34:31.560 --> 34:35.400]  And then of course, tomorrow is the big rally
[34:35.400 --> 34:36.920]  in Atlanta, Georgia.
[34:38.040 --> 34:41.800]  I predict that Trump supporting American patriots
[34:41.800 --> 34:45.200]  will essentially surround the capitol building
[34:45.200 --> 34:46.880]  there in downtown Atlanta.
[34:46.880 --> 34:51.720]  Of course, this is a nationwide demonstration.
[34:51.720 --> 34:53.760]  People are going to their state capitals
[34:53.760 --> 34:56.520]  at noon every Saturday.
[34:56.520 --> 34:58.600]  As part of this stop, the steel demonstration,
[34:58.600 --> 35:00.760]  I'm also hearing major groups
[35:00.760 --> 35:03.080]  are organizing for another million magma march
[35:03.080 --> 35:05.520]  on December 12th.
[35:05.520 --> 35:09.080]  I will be at the state capitol in Austin, Texas tomorrow
[35:09.080 --> 35:10.040]  at noon.
[35:12.040 --> 35:12.880]  Join me.
[35:13.840 --> 35:15.120]  People say, hey, well, you know,
[35:15.120 --> 35:16.360]  don't you know Trump won Texas?
[35:16.360 --> 35:17.200]  What are you doing?
[35:17.200 --> 35:20.240]  No, this is a United States of America
[35:20.240 --> 35:23.240]  protect our elections movement.
[35:23.240 --> 35:27.640]  This is a, everyone has to get involved.
[35:27.640 --> 35:29.000]  Sure, they're trying to steal Georgia,
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.640]  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada,
[35:32.640 --> 35:35.560]  but they're stealing our democracy.
[35:35.560 --> 35:38.620]  They're stealing our vote as a nation.
[35:39.840 --> 35:42.640]  So yes, everybody must get involved.
[35:43.680 --> 35:44.840]  I want to go to another video
[35:44.840 --> 35:47.360]  showing the complete voter fraud.
[35:47.360 --> 35:49.480]  And now you have Barack Obama making threats
[35:49.480 --> 35:53.400]  on national TV that I have a feeling is going to
[35:53.400 --> 35:55.200]  majorly backfire on him.
[35:55.200 --> 35:56.240]  So we'll have that coming up.
[35:56.240 --> 35:59.160]  But an individual who's getting retweeted
[35:59.160 --> 36:04.160]  by President Trump has put out multiple graphs
[36:05.200 --> 36:10.200]  of Wisconsin and Michigan, basically highlighting
[36:10.440 --> 36:12.840]  what I highlighted on the Stop and Steal caravan,
[36:12.840 --> 36:14.320]  except really going into detail
[36:14.320 --> 36:16.520]  and showing the complete fraud when they get
[36:17.560 --> 36:21.480]  tranches and boxes and boxes and boxes of votes,
[36:21.480 --> 36:23.960]  mail and ballots, magically hundreds of thousands
[36:23.960 --> 36:26.600]  all for Biden and only Biden.
[36:26.600 --> 36:29.400]  Nothing suspicious about that.
[36:29.400 --> 36:31.800]  And then he magically wins Wisconsin and Michigan.
[36:31.800 --> 36:34.200]  It's Justin Hart who's put all this out.
[36:34.200 --> 36:35.480]  Trump has retweeted it.
[36:35.480 --> 36:37.760]  This is all publicly available information,
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.840]  including a young individual who went and looked
[36:41.840 --> 36:46.840]  at the open data for the election results in Pennsylvania.
[36:47.240 --> 36:49.080]  And just on his own research found what appeared
[36:49.080 --> 36:51.440]  to be about a hundred thousand illegal votes,
[36:51.440 --> 36:52.800]  all for Joe Biden.
[36:52.800 --> 36:55.040]  Again, this is all publicly available information.
[36:55.040 --> 36:57.040]  Tucker Carlson go find this if he wants.
[36:58.160 --> 37:01.360]  Here is the actual Pennsylvania open data
[37:02.280 --> 37:06.520]  that show very mysterious patterns
[37:06.520 --> 37:10.320]  in the Pennsylvania votes coming in late at night.
[37:10.320 --> 37:12.320]  Again, this guy just went and analyzed the data.
[37:12.320 --> 37:13.520]  Here's what he found out.
[37:14.800 --> 37:17.680]  The following information is straight from the PA.gov website
[37:17.680 --> 37:21.120]  and has almost 3.1 million entries.
[37:21.120 --> 37:24.000]  I exported all that information into an Excel sheet,
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.120]  but I was cut off at about one million rows.
[37:26.120 --> 37:27.720]  So keep in mind we're working with one third
[37:27.720 --> 37:28.840]  of the whole data set.
[37:28.840 --> 37:30.280]  So the first thing I did was create a column
[37:30.280 --> 37:32.480]  to see if any ballots were mailed out by the government
[37:32.480 --> 37:33.720]  the same day that they were received,
[37:33.720 --> 37:36.480]  filled out through the mail by the voter.
[37:36.480 --> 37:39.360]  Turns out about 11,000 were filled out by the voter
[37:39.360 --> 37:41.000]  and returned back to the government the same day
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.360]  the government mailed them out to the voter.
[37:43.360 --> 37:45.600]  I then created a column to see if there were any applications
[37:45.600 --> 37:46.920]  that were approved by the government,
[37:46.920 --> 37:48.080]  mailed out by the government,
[37:48.080 --> 37:50.520]  received by the voter and then filled out by the voter
[37:50.520 --> 37:53.520]  and mailed back to the government on the same day.
[37:53.520 --> 37:56.520]  And there were 8,205 cases of that.
[37:56.520 --> 37:58.880]  And lastly, I created a column to see if there were any ballots
[37:58.880 --> 38:00.480]  that were received through the mail,
[38:00.480 --> 38:03.280]  filled out before they were even mailed out by the government.
[38:03.280 --> 38:06.480]  There were 7,403 cases of that.
[38:06.480 --> 38:09.560]  Pause the screen to read each definition of the columns.
[38:09.560 --> 38:11.160]  If anyone's able to make sense of these numbers
[38:11.160 --> 38:12.160]  without saying it's fraud,
[38:12.160 --> 38:13.960]  please let me know in the comments.
[38:13.960 --> 38:16.480]  Now you have to multiply those data sets by three
[38:16.480 --> 38:18.760]  because you only had one third of the actual data.
[38:18.760 --> 38:19.760]  And when it comes out to it,
[38:19.760 --> 38:24.760]  it's about 80,000 mail-in ballots that seem fake
[38:26.120 --> 38:28.320]  because of these dates not adding up.
[38:29.160 --> 38:30.800]  And it's all right there publicly available,
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.560]  about 100,000 votes for Biden magically with data,
[38:34.560 --> 38:36.960]  some of them dated that's literally impossible
[38:36.960 --> 38:38.960]  unless you have time travelers voting.
[38:38.960 --> 38:40.720]  I guess you have dead people voting for Biden.
[38:40.720 --> 38:43.200]  So I guess time travelers will too.
[38:43.200 --> 38:44.880]  And then you have mail-in ballots coming in
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.000]  and getting received and counted on the same day too.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.400]  Hmm, by the way, we do have clips of Biden
[38:51.400 --> 38:52.960]  who spoke today in Delaware.
[38:52.960 --> 38:55.280]  He's just as bad as he ever was, folks.
[38:55.280 --> 38:56.520]  He can't even think.
[38:56.520 --> 38:58.440]  He can't talk, he can't read a teleprompter.
[38:58.440 --> 39:00.680]  It's a total embarrassment.
[39:02.480 --> 39:04.040]  But this is where we're at.
[39:04.040 --> 39:05.320]  So we'll have that coming up too,
[39:05.320 --> 39:08.440]  as well as a threat that Obama made to President Trump,
[39:08.440 --> 39:10.200]  which I think, quite frankly,
[39:10.200 --> 39:13.180]  the odds are that this happens to you, Obama.
[39:14.160 --> 39:16.560]  Happen to know some Navy SEALs,
[39:16.560 --> 39:18.520]  some currently, some that are out.
[39:19.560 --> 39:21.960]  I don't know a single one that liked you.
[39:21.960 --> 39:24.400]  So, yeah.
[39:24.400 --> 39:25.880]  Oh, and by the way,
[39:25.880 --> 39:28.600]  you're not the Commander-in-Chief, bucko.
[39:28.600 --> 39:30.040]  Never forget that, folks.
[39:31.800 --> 39:35.280]  Commander-in-Chief is still Donald J. Trump.
[39:37.120 --> 39:38.880]  Is that the wild card?
[39:38.880 --> 39:40.560]  Or is that the ace card?
[39:40.560 --> 39:41.800]  Or is that the Trump card?
[39:43.040 --> 39:45.000]  This is the Alex Jones show,
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.080]  brought to you by InfowarsStore.com.
[39:47.080 --> 39:48.760]  I'm Owen Troyer, filling in for Alex Jones.
[39:48.760 --> 39:51.560]  We'll have more from Alex coming up on the other side.
[39:54.280 --> 39:57.480]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional
[39:57.480 --> 40:00.480]  criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist Chinese
[40:00.480 --> 40:01.840]  and the United Nations.
[40:01.840 --> 40:04.280]  And now, because the slaves have proven themselves
[40:04.280 --> 40:07.400]  to be subservient, the worst Australian models
[40:07.400 --> 40:10.080]  of complete lockdowns, you can't even leave your house,
[40:10.080 --> 40:12.400]  for months and months are being announced.
[40:12.400 --> 40:15.600]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks
[40:15.600 --> 40:18.640]  with water cannons to blast men, women, and children
[40:18.640 --> 40:21.160]  that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator,
[40:21.160 --> 40:22.840]  has put them under her control.
[40:22.840 --> 40:24.400]  That's right, she's been rigging elections
[40:24.400 --> 40:26.040]  for years and years.
[40:26.040 --> 40:29.000]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.480]  This is world government.
[40:30.480 --> 40:33.320]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more
[40:33.320 --> 40:35.200]  seen together will be arrested.
[40:35.200 --> 40:37.240]  They're announcing that Christmas is canceled.
[40:37.240 --> 40:39.640]  This is what the Communist takeover looks like,
[40:39.640 --> 40:42.760]  to bankrupt you, to take red of all your due process,
[40:42.760 --> 40:47.280]  and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[40:47.280 --> 40:49.360]  How long have we warned you about this?
[40:49.360 --> 40:50.520]  But you can fight back.
[40:50.520 --> 40:52.400]  America is the last bastion.
[40:52.400 --> 40:53.600]  Stop submitting.
[40:54.760 --> 40:56.000]  Remember Hillary Clinton?
[40:56.000 --> 40:56.840]  Remember Pelosi?
[40:56.840 --> 40:57.800]  Remember Bill Clinton?
[40:57.800 --> 40:59.160]  Remember Obama?
[40:59.160 --> 41:02.280]  All of them said, we are not gonna concede
[41:02.280 --> 41:04.040]  if there's a red mirage.
[41:04.040 --> 41:05.640]  We believe it's gonna look like Trump's gonna win
[41:05.640 --> 41:07.920]  in landslides as they have the internal polls.
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.320]  And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time
[41:11.320 --> 41:12.920]  by an even bigger margin.
[41:12.920 --> 41:14.680]  And when he was set to win the other ones,
[41:14.680 --> 41:19.280]  they froze the seven states on election night,
[41:19.280 --> 41:21.560]  and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots
[41:21.560 --> 41:22.400]  they had.
[41:22.400 --> 41:23.240]  This is completely transparent.
[41:23.240 --> 41:25.840]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[41:25.840 --> 41:27.120]  Trump has not conceded.
[41:27.120 --> 41:28.880]  None of the states have certified the vote.
[41:28.880 --> 41:31.040]  And now all these investigations have been opened up.
[41:31.040 --> 41:34.200]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud
[41:34.200 --> 41:38.000]  has come out and already been documented in Georgia.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.520]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[41:40.520 --> 41:42.800]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[41:42.800 --> 41:45.160]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time
[41:45.160 --> 41:46.760]  because the last hoax failed.
[41:46.760 --> 41:48.680]  But now, this is the mother of all hoaxes.
[41:48.680 --> 41:50.920]  And if they get away with this, it's the end of America.
[41:50.920 --> 41:53.000]  As we know it, we will be Venezuela.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.480]  Infowars.com.
[41:55.880 --> 41:58.480]  Big Tech is in league with the globalist
[41:58.480 --> 42:01.640]  and the China cops as attempting an information too
[42:01.640 --> 42:02.960]  against America.
[42:02.960 --> 42:04.800]  And when we take this country back,
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.720]  they must be held accountable as SDNR's operatives.
[42:09.720 --> 42:10.840]  The games are over.
[42:10.840 --> 42:12.120]  The waiting is over.
[42:12.120 --> 42:13.760]  The fight is now out in the open.
[42:13.760 --> 42:17.400]  World government is here in the latter part of 2020
[42:17.400 --> 42:19.560]  is attempting to collapse the world economy,
[42:19.560 --> 42:21.320]  set up the global digital currency
[42:21.320 --> 42:23.080]  and AI surveillance system.
[42:23.080 --> 42:25.360]  And Infowars is on the front lines,
[42:25.360 --> 42:26.680]  fighting harder than ever.
[42:26.680 --> 42:28.560]  And we pledge we do to never back down
[42:28.560 --> 42:30.600]  and never give up in the face of this evil
[42:30.600 --> 42:32.680]  because we know God is watching.
[42:32.680 --> 42:33.920]  And God is in charge.
[42:33.920 --> 42:35.720]  And God is on our side.
[42:35.720 --> 42:37.760]  Infowars can only stay in the fight
[42:37.760 --> 42:39.360]  and continue to be the tip of the spear
[42:39.360 --> 42:40.880]  if you financially support us
[42:40.880 --> 42:42.720]  by getting great products at the same time
[42:42.720 --> 42:44.160]  at Infowars.com.
[42:44.160 --> 42:45.960]  And we have one of the biggest sales of the year
[42:45.960 --> 42:48.040]  about to end up a 60% off.
[42:48.040 --> 42:49.840]  Triple Patriot points in free shipping
[42:49.840 --> 42:52.640]  with the stop to steal special at Infowars.com.
[42:55.800 --> 42:57.960]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now
[42:57.960 --> 43:00.600]  by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America,
[43:00.600 --> 43:02.520]  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs.
[43:02.520 --> 43:04.560]  They're saying that the COVID virus
[43:04.560 --> 43:06.480]  is going to cause a global depression
[43:06.480 --> 43:08.440]  and hundreds of millions of starved deaths.
[43:08.440 --> 43:09.720]  Incredible.
[43:09.720 --> 43:11.240]  They're the very organizations
[43:11.240 --> 43:13.400]  that ordered the global lockdowns
[43:13.400 --> 43:15.200]  that are causing the chain reaction
[43:15.200 --> 43:16.920]  that's causing the mass starvation,
[43:16.920 --> 43:18.560]  not the COVID virus.
[43:18.560 --> 43:19.760]  That is a fact.
[43:19.760 --> 43:21.320]  And all the hero's sheep,
[43:21.320 --> 43:23.200]  where the mask can go along with this
[43:23.200 --> 43:25.360]  are signing on to mass murder
[43:25.360 --> 43:26.920]  bigger than what Hitler did.
[43:26.920 --> 43:28.800]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention
[43:28.800 --> 43:30.360]  and the Nuremberg Code.
[43:30.360 --> 43:33.200]  This is a medical, world government,
[43:33.200 --> 43:35.800]  tyrannical takeover, causing starvation,
[43:35.800 --> 43:37.120]  setting up world IDs,
[43:37.120 --> 43:39.280]  and coming with forced inoculations.
[43:39.280 --> 43:41.840]  And now Bank of America says global unrest
[43:41.840 --> 43:44.400]  is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[43:44.400 --> 43:46.160]  That story's on Infowars.com.
[43:46.160 --> 43:48.680]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public
[43:48.680 --> 43:50.400]  and to say you're not stand for this
[43:50.400 --> 43:52.560]  or the mass global genocide being caused
[43:52.560 --> 43:54.640]  by the planetary Great Reset.
[43:54.640 --> 43:58.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[44:09.240 --> 44:12.120]  When people build temples,
[44:12.120 --> 44:14.120]  when powerful groups come together
[44:14.120 --> 44:18.440]  and itch their commandments into stone
[44:18.440 --> 44:21.280]  and then put billions and billions of dollars
[44:21.280 --> 44:24.840]  into a project over decade after decade,
[44:24.840 --> 44:27.480]  you know it's their true love.
[44:27.480 --> 44:29.760]  We're here at the birthplace
[44:29.760 --> 44:32.480]  of the modern depopulation movement
[44:32.480 --> 44:35.840]  spearheaded by Ted Turner and then of course Bill Gates.
[44:35.840 --> 44:40.520]  We're here a few hours outside Atlanta, Georgia to the north
[44:40.520 --> 44:44.640]  at a place where Ted Turner's great-grandmother
[44:44.640 --> 44:45.960]  was from.
[44:45.960 --> 44:50.120]  And they built this monument
[44:50.120 --> 44:54.680]  calling for forced depopulation of the planet
[44:54.680 --> 44:56.680]  and one world government.
[44:57.680 --> 45:00.080]  And here we are 30 years later.
[45:02.080 --> 45:04.880]  And it's not the planning stages, the beta stages anymore.
[45:04.880 --> 45:06.880]  Now they've dropped the hammer, now inside of it.
[45:06.880 --> 45:09.680]  So look at this archetypal image.
[45:09.680 --> 45:12.920]  It's like a giant giant giant giant giant giant giant
[45:12.920 --> 45:15.920]  giant giant giant giant giant giant giant
[45:15.920 --> 45:19.080]  giant giant giant giant giant giant giant giant,
[45:19.080 --> 45:23.480]  giant giant giant giant giant giant giant giant giant
[45:25.640 --> 45:30.900]  giant giant giant giant giant giant giant giant
[45:30.960 --> 45:36.560]  giant giant giant giant giant giant different
[45:36.560 --> 45:41.720]  giant giant giant giant giant giant giant giant giant
[45:41.720 --> 45:45.720]  giant giant giant giant giant giant
[45:45.720 --> 45:55.720]  This is the excuse of the elites to rule over the population, and then you had them social Darwinists at the turn of the last century, 1900, and the robber barons.
[45:55.720 --> 45:59.720]  And that was only a shadow.
[45:59.720 --> 46:03.720]  See, that was all just the beginning. That was all the testing.
[46:03.720 --> 46:09.720]  And we were there showing you the shape of their plans, showing you the books they wrote, the quotes they put out about depopulation.
[46:09.720 --> 46:17.720]  Prince Philip, Prince Charles, all saying we need to cut the world economy off.
[46:17.720 --> 46:19.720]  We need less consumption.
[46:19.720 --> 46:29.720]  And they said 10 years ago in the Rockefeller Foundation, Operation Lockstep will use a global threat of a virus to kill civilization and collapse the third world and collapse the first world.
[46:29.720 --> 46:31.720]  And now we're told it never ends.
[46:31.720 --> 46:55.720]  So all of that was the buildup to where we are moving from Plato, right here, 2000 plus years ago, over the ages, all the slavery, all the wars, and all the way up in time.
[46:55.720 --> 47:05.720]  Five hundred and fifty years ago, we finally have the Renaissance and real Christian ideas and egalitarianism to build up humanity, to take care of the poor, to have running water.
[47:05.720 --> 47:07.720]  And that actually created our golden age.
[47:07.720 --> 47:10.720]  But they're deciding to go back to what Plato wanted.
[47:10.720 --> 47:12.720]  And that's where we are.
[47:12.720 --> 47:17.720]  We're not in the shadow of this anymore. We're not in the planning phases.
[47:17.720 --> 47:23.720]  We're now in the future, with those evil visions of the past.
[47:23.720 --> 47:26.720]  Now manifesting in the year 2020.
[47:26.720 --> 47:30.720]  We're now zero hour.
[47:30.720 --> 47:39.720]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN, the Davis Group, all admit that their plan is to be the guardians of the galaxy.
[47:39.720 --> 47:41.720]  They'll decide who lives and dies.
[47:41.720 --> 47:47.720]  This is a UN temple, a UN shrine, maintaining humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature.
[47:47.720 --> 47:49.720]  Somebody get out their calculator.
[47:49.720 --> 47:59.720]  If there's seven and a half billion people in the world, and only 500 million are left, that's over an 80% population reduction.
[47:59.720 --> 48:02.720]  Wow, Hitler only killed 20 million. They want to kill billions.
[48:02.720 --> 48:05.720]  Step aside, Hitler.
[48:05.720 --> 48:08.720]  Guide reproductions systems wisely.
[48:08.720 --> 48:11.720]  Improving fitness and diversity. That's eugenics.
[48:11.720 --> 48:13.720]  They decide who can have children, who can't.
[48:13.720 --> 48:15.720]  That's why China had one show of policies.
[48:15.720 --> 48:24.720]  While they try to dumb the public down and make us as sick as possible, everything they say is the opposite of what they're actually doing when it comes to these little platitudes they put in.
[48:24.720 --> 48:28.720]  But they tell the truth in the first commandment and in the last commandment.
[48:28.720 --> 48:35.720]  Let's go to the last commandment. Be not a cancer on the earth. Leave room for nature. Leave room for nature.
[48:35.720 --> 48:46.720]  But the big trillion dollar companies and billionaires with their slave camps in China and Tim Cook won't even pay the workers in China enough to even have a house to live in, so most of them are homeless with engineering degrees.
[48:46.720 --> 48:49.720]  And they go inside and their kids are chained up to power poles all day.
[48:49.720 --> 48:53.720]  Oh, the left loves that. They hate Trump because he's anti-war.
[48:53.720 --> 48:57.720]  Because see, war depopulates.
[48:57.720 --> 49:01.720]  Maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature.
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.720]  Guide reproduction wisely, improving fitness and diversity.
[49:05.720 --> 49:09.720]  Unite humanity with a living new language, Esperanza, the UN global language.
[49:09.720 --> 49:16.720]  Rule, passion, faith, tradition and all things with temperate reason, meaning they are the gods that give us reason.
[49:16.720 --> 49:19.720]  They decide who the social justice warriors are. They decide what's moral.
[49:19.720 --> 49:24.720]  Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts through the UN.
[49:24.720 --> 49:30.720]  Let all nations rule internally, resolving external disputes in a world court.
[49:30.720 --> 49:32.720]  All of its doublespeak.
[49:32.720 --> 49:35.720]  Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
[49:35.720 --> 49:44.720]  Eat a world government that dissolves your local government that you control and then you can't say a damn thing to the United Nations that runs extermination operations worldwide.
[49:44.720 --> 49:48.720]  Balance personal rights with social duties.
[49:48.720 --> 49:54.720]  You don't really have any rights in Article 30 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[49:54.720 --> 49:59.720]  It says, oh, you have all these previous ones unless we say so, then we can take them away.
[49:59.720 --> 50:02.720]  Well, the right you can take is not a right at all.
[50:02.720 --> 50:07.720]  Prize truth, beauty, love, seeking harmony with the infinite.
[50:07.720 --> 50:13.720]  Be not a cancer on the earth. Leave room for nature. Leave room for nature.
[50:13.720 --> 50:17.720]  You've got eight major languages of the world.
[50:17.720 --> 50:20.720]  That's that's Cyrillic.
[50:20.720 --> 50:33.720]  You've got Japanese and Chinese, you've got Arabic, Sanskrit, but over here it gives you a full breakdown.
[50:33.720 --> 50:45.720]  Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, English, Spanish.
[50:45.720 --> 50:51.720]  And then up at the top, let these guide stones to an age of reason.
[50:51.720 --> 51:03.720]  Egyptian hieroglyphics, Sanskrit, classical Greek, Babylonian cuneiform, the Georgia guide stones.
[51:03.720 --> 51:07.720]  Channel through stone indicates celestial pole.
[51:07.720 --> 51:12.720]  Horizontal slot indicates annual travel of the sun, transit of the sun.
[51:12.720 --> 51:16.720]  One beam through the capstone marks noontime throughout the year.
[51:16.720 --> 51:22.720]  Arthur, author, RC Christian, a pseudonym for the Genesis groups.
[51:22.720 --> 51:27.720]  Sponsors, a small group of Americans who seek the age of reason.
[51:27.720 --> 51:35.720]  The capsule plays six feet below this spot to be opened on after they've depopulated the earth.
[51:35.720 --> 51:39.720]  Oh, and many of them believe it's a great wonderful thing they're doing.
[51:39.720 --> 51:44.720]  But really, it's all a great deception to not value humanity, to get rid of the population,
[51:44.720 --> 51:47.720]  to become transhumanists and actually throw off all of our humanity.
[51:47.720 --> 51:52.720]  Now they've revealed the deception, and now they admit it's a post-human world entirely.
[51:52.720 --> 52:00.720]  Physical data, overall height, 19 feet, three inches. Total weight, 237, 746 pounds.
[52:00.720 --> 52:08.720]  Four major stones are 16 feet, four inches high, each weighing an average of 42, 437 pounds, 42,000 pounds.
[52:08.720 --> 52:12.720]  Center stone is 16 feet, four inches high, weighs 20,000 plus pounds.
[52:12.720 --> 52:17.720]  Capstone, nine feet, eight inches long.
[52:17.720 --> 52:23.720]  Six feet, six inches wide, one foot, seven inches thick, weighs 24,000 plus pounds.
[52:23.720 --> 52:27.720]  You can read it all right there for yourself.
[52:27.720 --> 52:33.720]  All of this, an occultic sundial, trying to call in the power of the universe,
[52:33.720 --> 52:40.720]  the energy of the universe into this place to carry out this commitment,
[52:40.720 --> 52:50.720]  to carry out this demand letter to humanity that we submit and that we bow down.
[52:50.720 --> 52:56.720]  All right, you can decide whether you want to bow down to this or whether you want to fight it,
[52:56.720 --> 53:02.720]  but the point is this is the world, this is the globalist, this is their plan, this is what they're doing.
[53:02.720 --> 53:04.720]  And you're now inside the trap.
[53:04.720 --> 53:07.720]  They've launched it in 2020, 30 years after this was constructed.
[53:07.720 --> 53:10.720]  It didn't begin with this, but this is a signpost.
[53:10.720 --> 53:16.720]  This is a tombstone placed over humanity if we accept this curse.
[53:16.720 --> 53:19.720]  Do humans hurt the earth? Absolutely.
[53:19.720 --> 53:24.720]  Are the globalists doing genetic engineering, human animal cloning, toxic waste, things unspeakable?
[53:24.720 --> 53:26.720]  They actually believe they're going to transcend humanity.
[53:26.720 --> 53:29.720]  They just don't want us to profane to go into their new age.
[53:29.720 --> 53:33.720]  They must cleanse the earth before they can take over and have the future.
[53:33.720 --> 53:38.720]  And now they're coming with mRNA vaccines that change your DNA and make you a GMO creature.
[53:38.720 --> 53:44.720]  So now that they're in full control, you see the horrible nightmare they're creating that actually kills the earth.
[53:44.720 --> 53:46.720]  Soon there'll be 5G at this location.
[53:46.720 --> 53:48.720]  It's already rippling with cell towers.
[53:48.720 --> 53:52.720]  The wildlife's already dying and you don't see the globalists fighting that.
[53:52.720 --> 53:54.720]  No, the truth is they want to play God.
[53:54.720 --> 53:57.720]  And everything they do is about playing God.
[53:57.720 --> 54:00.720]  Now let's go over here and show you some of the surveillance systems that are here as well.
[54:05.720 --> 54:07.720]  Let's get a wide shot of that too.
[54:07.720 --> 54:28.720]  They've been maintaining this for 30 years, tens of millions of dollars to maintain it.
[54:28.720 --> 54:31.720]  They've got all these surveillance cameras over there.
[54:31.720 --> 54:42.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the full Alex Jones video live from the Georgia Guidestones can be found at band.video and infowars.com.
[55:01.720 --> 55:07.720]  Until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationalists and populists.
[55:07.720 --> 55:08.720]  And now that's happened.
[55:08.720 --> 55:17.720]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate and protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown.
[55:17.720 --> 55:22.720]  And that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19, especially an overblown hoax.
[55:22.720 --> 55:29.720]  He started to do that in the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[55:29.720 --> 55:34.720]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American people and divide us.
[55:34.720 --> 55:38.720]  And they're going to use economic warfare, shredding down the economy to try to control us.
[55:38.720 --> 55:43.720]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air. Tell me what's coming next.
[55:45.720 --> 55:50.720]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[55:50.720 --> 55:53.720]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[55:53.720 --> 56:02.720]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[56:02.720 --> 56:08.720]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[56:08.720 --> 56:17.720]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[56:17.720 --> 56:20.720]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[56:20.720 --> 56:25.720]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.720]  A global permanent lockdown is here that is already causing millions and millions of starving deaths.
[56:30.720 --> 56:32.720]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[56:32.720 --> 56:37.720]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said
[56:37.720 --> 56:40.720]  the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[56:40.720 --> 56:44.720]  That's the facts. This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[56:44.720 --> 56:49.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:14.720 --> 57:24.720]  In Owen Schreuer here sitting in for Alex, I want to go to this clip.
[57:24.720 --> 57:33.720]  Barack Obama was on a not funny comedy show last night with Jimmy Shimmel and he made a threat to President Trump saying
[57:33.720 --> 57:37.720]  Navy Seals may remove him from the White House.
[57:37.720 --> 57:47.720]  I think the odds are more likely that Navy Seals pay a visit to you, Hussein, but here is Hussein Obama last night on Jimmy Shimmel.
[57:47.720 --> 57:57.720]  Do you feel that when you congratulated Biden and Senator Harris that you were premature in doing that?
[57:57.720 --> 58:08.720]  No. I thought I was right on time. There seems to be some lag.
[58:08.720 --> 58:12.720]  The communication system in the White House used to be better. It was real time.
[58:12.720 --> 58:19.720]  There's a lot of computers there that actually tell you what is going on around the world.
[58:19.720 --> 58:22.720]  You know the White House well. You lived there for eight years.
[58:22.720 --> 58:29.720]  Are there places someone could hide like if, say, they were going to be removed?
[58:29.720 --> 58:33.720]  Are there little cubby holes or anything which you know about?
[58:33.720 --> 58:39.720]  Well, I think we can always send the Navy Seals in there to dig them out.
[58:39.720 --> 58:44.720]  Yeah, and you see how he clutches his throat there a couple times, has to take a deep swallow.
[58:44.720 --> 58:53.720]  Yeah, he knows. Get him off the screen. This is all a giant act, folks. It's all one big act.
[58:53.720 --> 59:00.720]  As if Jimmy Kimmel show is popular. As if Obama and Jimmy Kimmel is like the hottest thing. Nobody cares.
[59:00.720 --> 59:05.720]  Nobody's watching that crap. Obama is the most despised president in U.S. history.
[59:05.720 --> 59:11.720]  He'll go down as the most corrupt. All they have is their charades. All they have is their facades.
[59:11.720 --> 59:15.720]  But they go on TV and smile and laugh to hold the facade up.
[59:15.720 --> 59:25.720]  No. No, Barry, oh, I think the odds are more likely that the Navy Seals send you to prison for life.
[59:25.720 --> 59:37.720]  Or send you to testify against the charges coming against you for treason.
[59:37.720 --> 59:45.720]  No, Barack, I think it's you who may be getting a visit from the Navy Seals.
[59:45.720 --> 59:50.720]  I think it's you who may have an extended stay at Guantanamo Bay.
[59:50.720 --> 59:56.720]  At least if we're weighing the odds, Trump being visited by the Navy Seals and removed or arrested.
[59:56.720 --> 1:00:02.720]  No, not very high odds on that. You? Hmm.
[1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:09.720]  I guarantee you I could have Navy Seals calling this show right now.
[1:00:09.720 --> 1:00:21.720]  And they'd say, yeah, uh, there ain't a chance we're going to go in and remove Trump from some phony command of Barack Obama.
[1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:27.720]  We do have, is that a live feed from the Capitol guys in Atlanta?
[1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:33.720]  We do have a live feed. The rally is on right now in Atlanta, the capital of Georgia.
[1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:39.720]  As you can see, there are speakers there. And once again, Trump supporters and patriots lined up by the hundreds.
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:47.720]  It's gathering momentum. I imagine it's going to be thousands tomorrow.
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:56.720]  So we will continue to monitor that. Again, these are happening nationwide at state capitals at noon on Saturday until Trump is inaugurated.
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:03.720]  So if you want to get involved in this noon at your state Capitol every Saturday.
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:10.720]  So that means yes, I will be at the state Capitol in Austin, Texas tomorrow at noon.
[1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:18.720]  And yes, there will be thousands gathered in Georgia attempting to stop the steal of our election there.
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:31.720]  And this is important for all of us to get behind not just people in Georgia or Michigan or Pennsylvania where the steal is really happening because the steal is against all of us.
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:40.720]  All right. When we come back, I do have some other news I want to get to Alex Jones could pop in at any time.
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:43.720]  And I may open up the phone lines.
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:49.720]  It is Friday, so we may open up the phone lines and take your calls. We haven't heard much from you this week.
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:52.720]  It's the info wars dot com Alex Jones show.

[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:37.720]  877-789-2539 877-789-2539.
[1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:44.720]  And if there is if there are any Navy SEALs tuned in or former Navy SEALs or family members of Navy SEALs who want to weigh in on Obama saying
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:47.720]  Navy SEALs would remove Trump from the White House.
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:55.720]  We'll put you to the front line just just you know just because we'll just see how that goes.
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:58.720]  I don't think see but it's all the fake news folks.
[1:03:58.720 --> 1:03:59.720]  That's all they do.
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:00.720]  It's all charades.
[1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:01.720]  It's all Baghdad Bob.
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:03.720]  It's all Tokyo Rose.
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:06.720]  It's all WWE promos.
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:09.720]  It's all fake.
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:10.720]  Obama is despised.
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:11.720]  Nobody likes him.
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:13.720]  His own voters can't stand him.
[1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:14.720]  He's a total phony.
[1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:18.720]  He's guilty of treason up one side and down the other.
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:23.720]  But he goes on late night comedy shows with Jimmy Kimmel and smiles and laughs.
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:24.720]  Ha ha ha.
[1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:25.720]  Oh why yee.
[1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:27.720]  Ah Navy SEALs will get Trump woo hoo.
[1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:28.720]  It's all fake folks.
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:29.720]  It's all fake.
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:31.720]  It's all a giant act.
[1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:34.720]  It's all a Psyop.
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:36.720]  It's all it is.
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:40.720]  No Barack you know what's coming don't you.
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:43.720]  You know here's my biggest fear right now.
[1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:52.720]  Aside from how hard it's going to be to stop this SEAL when it's all done electronically electronically.
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:59.720]  You know the hubris and the arrogance of an Andrew Cuomo in New York.
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:19.720]  The hubris and the arrogance of a Governor Whitmer of a Gavin Newsom a Tom Wolf saying you have to mask in your home saying you can't open your business saying you have to be shut down forever you can't leave your home.
[1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:23.720]  There's something there is something to that.
[1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:25.720]  That's not palpable right now.
[1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:51.720]  And the reason why it's so scary is because they wouldn't be this arrogant and this flippant in their disgust for the American people and then their blatant tyranny unless they knew they were safe and there was something else coming.
[1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:55.720]  I just have a weird.
[1:05:55.720 --> 1:06:03.720]  I just have a weird feeling that their arrogance and their hubris in their totalitarian.
[1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:25.720]  Dictate measures of shutting everything down for a fake pandemic and then bragging about it and then going out to dinner without a mask and having parties without a mask and Cuomo scolding the media scolding parents scolding teachers.
[1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:36.720]  The Democrat governor Pennsylvania Tom Wolf says you have to wear a mask in your home Democrat mayors in St. Louis and Chicago and New York are saying you can't even leave your home.
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:42.720]  That arrogance that hubris in your face discussed.
[1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:50.720]  And criminal activity criminal behavior from them is a big indicator folks that they have they know something else is coming.
[1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:56.720]  For them to have that much confidence means that they think they're really safeguarded.
[1:06:56.720 --> 1:06:58.720]  Now it could be a mis-measurement.
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:01.720]  They could be just falling for their own PR campaigns.
[1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:06.720]  They could be falling for their own BS.
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:07.720]  But they really think they've won.
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:09.720]  They really think they're enslaving all Americans.
[1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:11.720]  They really think you're a piece of dirt.
[1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:12.720]  They think you are scum.
[1:07:12.720 --> 1:07:14.720]  You are an you are not even an aunt.
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:19.720]  You're an aunt dropping to these people to Cuomo and Whitmer and Wolf and light foot.
[1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:26.720]  And Newsom and yes Biden.
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:30.720]  And they wouldn't be behaving that way unless they thought they have you totally shackled.
[1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:32.720]  They have you totally owned.
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:36.720]  They own you.
[1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:44.720]  That arrogance does not come lightly.
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:49.720]  And you have Joe Biden in fact we'll go to a short clip here.
[1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:53.720]  He had a press conference today in Delaware.
[1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:55.720]  This goon squad.
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:57.720]  This clown act.
[1:07:57.720 --> 1:07:59.720]  This hack.
[1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:00.720]  This smuck.
[1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:02.720]  This criminal.
[1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:05.720]  This dementia ridden hag.
[1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:08.720]  This plastic faced corpse.
[1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:11.720]  This rotting husk of a soul.
[1:08:11.720 --> 1:08:14.720]  This pathetic excuse for a man.
[1:08:14.720 --> 1:08:17.720]  This is our fake president-elect.
[1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:19.720]  Listen to him fumble and bumble.
[1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:21.720]  He doesn't even know where the hell he is.
[1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:22.720]  He can't think.
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:23.720]  He can't read.
[1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:24.720]  He can't talk.
[1:08:24.720 --> 1:08:33.720]  A fake president-elect scumbag dirtbag lowlife loser who wants to dominate us.
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:36.720]  Here he is today the fake president-elect.
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:40.720]  We talked a lot about with the governors about what the immediate needs are.
[1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:44.720]  I'm going to we're going to impose the we're going to enforce the excuse me
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:51.720]  employ the defense reconstruct the act to be able to go out there and dictate
[1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:54.720]  companies build and do following things.
[1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:55.720]  We need much more testing.
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:08:57.720]  We need much more masking.
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:08:59.720]  I mean that's more we need gloves.
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:03.720]  I asked an east to go and I asked the National Government Association through the governor Cuomo
[1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:07.720]  and the ones on the line to let us know what their shortages are.
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:10.720]  This pathetic man.
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:13.720]  Just pathetic.
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:17.720]  And there were other gaffes in his little press conference today.
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:20.720]  I mean this guy's just a joke man.
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:28.720]  And I'll tell you what our country's a joke that he is not in jail.
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:31.720]  Really embarrassing isn't it?
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:35.720]  Look at some of Joe Biden's tweets today.
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:43.720]  At least 30 at least 37 transgender and gender nonconforming people have been killed this year.
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:46.720]  By the way hundreds of them commit suicide but they never talk about that.
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:49.720]  Most of them black and brown transgender women.
[1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:52.720]  Yeah because they're the ones that are targeted for this by the propaganda.
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:54.720]  It's intolerable.
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:58.720]  This transgender day of remembrance.
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:03.720]  We honor their lives and recommit to the work that remains to end this epidemic of violence.
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:05.720]  Total fake news.
[1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:06.720]  Total fake story.
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:07.720]  Nobody cares.
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:08.720]  Nobody knows.
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:09.720]  It's nothing.
[1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:10.720]  It's a nothing burger.
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:14.720]  But see it's and of course there's no even there's no political pull here.
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:15.720]  It's all pandering.
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:17.720]  It's all insulting humanity.
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:20.720]  It's all part of the social engineering.
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:24.720]  Normalizing sexually mutilating your child.
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:31.720]  Normalizing the sexual psychological rape of your child.
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.720]  And of course it's Joe Biden.
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:37.720]  The guy who's first act and celebrating he was a president was molesting a child.
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:40.720]  He's showing you Joe Biden is a child molester.
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:42.720]  He announces he wins president.
[1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:43.720]  They bring out a baby.
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:44.720]  Clear the whole stage.
[1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:48.720]  He molests the baby on stage on camera and then they all celebrate and come in and join him.
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:52.720]  It's all a satanic cult act folks.
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:53.720]  Joe Biden goes on TV.
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:56.720]  Yeah I bribed the Ukrainian government to get my son millions of dollars.
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:57.720]  Screw you.
[1:10:57.720 --> 1:10:58.720]  I'm freaking Joe Biden.
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:00.720]  I run this show.
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:02.720]  Yeah I like kids so much.
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:05.720]  They crawl on my legs and I like molesting them and jumping them up and down.
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:10.720]  And I grabbed their wives butts and boobs and all their children's faces and necks and sniff them and lick them.
[1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:11.720]  That's what I do.
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:15.720]  I'm Joe Biden bitch.
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:17.720]  Sick.
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:19.720]  Sick.
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:28.720]  A child molesting psychological torturing demon.
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:31.720]  He says by the way they stole this one from President Trump.
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:34.720]  Wearing a mask isn't a political statement.
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:36.720]  It's a patriotic duty.
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:37.720]  That's what Trump said three months ago.
[1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:38.720]  I disagreed with them then.
[1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:42.720]  But it's funny now they steal it and they say oh it's patriotic to wear a mask.
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:46.720]  I'm so sick of this crap man.
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:50.720]  You know what here's the good news.
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:52.720]  America's not just going to go into tyranny.
[1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:53.720]  We may win this battle.
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:54.720]  We may save America.
[1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:55.720]  We may not.
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:12:11.720]  But I'm not the one that has about 100 million people ready to find me and to end me.
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:13.720]  No I'm not the tyrant in government.
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:15.720]  No I'm not the one that shut down your business.
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:17.720]  No I'm not the one that censored your free speech.
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:19.720]  No I'm not the one that spent trillions of dollars on wars.
[1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:22.720]  No I'm not the one that lied about weapons of mass destruction.
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:24.720]  No I'm not the one that lied about Russian collusion.
[1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:26.720]  No I'm not the one that lied about Kavanaugh.
[1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:27.720]  I'm not the one that lied about hate crimes.
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:28.720]  I'm not the liar.
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:29.720]  I'm not the fraud.
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:30.720]  That's Joe Biden.
[1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:31.720]  That's CNN.
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:32.720]  That's MSNBC.
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:35.720]  So you guys can go ahead and try to roll out this tyranny.
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:37.720]  You can continue on with this fake pandemic.
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:38.720]  You can try to steal this election.
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:44.720]  But every day you continue this another million Americans gets red in their eyes and smoke
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:46.720]  out of their ears and they're looking at you.
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:48.720]  They're looking at you Joe.
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:50.720]  They're looking at you.
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:56.720]  It really is simple the left are into being deviant and I don't mean sexually deviant.
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:58.720]  That goes to territory.
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:00.720]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors.
[1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:02.720]  Deviant against their own species.
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:05.720]  Deviant against the order of nature.
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:09.720]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous they still do it because they want
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:10.720]  to play God.
[1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:12.720]  Everything they touch they destroy.
[1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:16.720]  Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts.
[1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:20.720]  Their religion is not taking care of the old but euthanizing them.
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:25.720]  Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep their world countries in serious poverty
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:26.720]  and poor.
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:31.720]  Ballooning populations are then watching all that new fruit down the vine to continually
[1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:34.720]  reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again.
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:36.720]  They truly are the children of Satan.
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:38.720]  They are the children of the devil.
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:41.720]  Have you look at the slaves that serve the Biden and Kamala Harris.
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:44.720]  It really is manifested being a slave of Satan is not profitable.
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:46.720]  Sin is not profitable.
[1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:50.720]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the Info War.
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:55.720]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:57.720]  Chinese and the United Nations.
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:03.720]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient the worst Australian models
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:07.720]  of complete lockdowns you can't even leave your house for months and months are being
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:13.720]  announced and in Germany the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:18.720]  blast men, women and children that protest the fact that Merkel the dictator has put them
[1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:19.720]  under her control.
[1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:22.720]  That's why she's been rigging elections for years and years.
[1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:25.720]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:26.720]  This is world government.
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:31.720]  In Philadelphia they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:33.720]  They're announcing the Christmas is canceled.
[1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:38.720]  This is what the Communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you, to take red of all your due
[1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:43.720]  process and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:45.720]  How long have we warned you about this?
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:47.720]  But you can fight back.
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:49.720]  America is the last bastion.
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:15:09.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:11.720]  I'm going to try to calm down here.
[1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:23.720]  Zero tolerance for tyrants and just no holds barred here on air and Joe Biden and the people
[1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:26.720]  that own him are enemies of you.
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:29.720]  They want to take everything from you.
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:31.720]  They want to destroy your family.
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:33.720]  They want to destroy your livelihood.
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:35.720]  They want to destroy your country folks.
[1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:36.720]  So it's a little hard.
[1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:37.720]  Okay, I'm going to be honest.
[1:15:37.720 --> 1:15:40.720]  It's a little hard covering these tyrants and having to deal with the reality that they
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:42.720]  want to dominate us.
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:46.720]  And they are feet away from total tyranny.
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:50.720]  They are feet away from being in charge of a global government infrastructure that will
[1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:59.720]  without a doubt make you poor and hungry and broke with nothing.
[1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:06.720]  So it's a tough thing to sit here and deal with this and cover this and not call it
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:16.720]  like it is and cross that boundary of what needs to happen and not get flagrantly angry
[1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:21.720]  because it is infuriating.
[1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:26.720]  We go to, we spend trillions of dollars to fight wars in countries halfway around the
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:33.720]  planet when the biggest enemies of our country are sitting in the halls of Congress and
[1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:36.720]  governor mansions and mayor mansions.
[1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:37.720]  They are the real enemies.
[1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:40.720]  Yeah, we should be sending the Navy Seals after Barack Obama.
[1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:44.720]  Yeah, we should be sending the military in to arrest Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer
[1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:47.720]  and Tom Wolf and Laurie Lightfoot.
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:50.720]  And yes, Joe Biden.
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:56.720]  And yet these criminals, these enemies of humanity, these enemies of freedom, these
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:07.720]  enemies of truth, these enemies of righteousness are inches away from owning you.
[1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:11.720]  So I get a little upset, but I'm going to take a deep breath and I'm going to go to
[1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:12.720]  the callers.
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:16.720]  Real quick though, ladies and gentlemen, we are monitoring the Stop the Steel rally in
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:17.720]  Atlanta, Georgia.
[1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:22.720]  We are going to be nationwide state capitals tomorrow at noon.
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:27.720]  And I'll be at the one here in Austin, Texas, ladies and gentlemen, get into the battle
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:28.720]  now.
[1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:29.720]  Get into the arena.
[1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:33.720]  Fight for your country now before Joe Biden kills it.
[1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:39.720]  And everything we do is made possible with your support at infowarstore.com.

[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:10.720]  We go to the phone lines.
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:12.720]  Let's start in Georgia.
[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:16.720]  Ian in Georgia, you're on the Info Wars Alex Jones show.
[1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:17.720]  Go ahead.
[1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:18.720]  Hey, Owen.
[1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:23.720]  I'm a, I'm 23 years old and I listen to you guys every day and I love what you do.
[1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:24.720]  So thank you.
[1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:30.720]  And I voted for Kemp in 2018 and I was pretty proud of him for not implementing mass mandates
[1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:33.720]  and having a relatively short lockdown.
[1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:38.720]  But if he certifies this election without calling a special session, he'll lose in 2022.
[1:18:38.720 --> 1:18:43.720]  He's not going to stab Trump and his supporters in the back and get away with it.
[1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:48.720]  And you know, that's another one of my fears here, Ian, is that why would Kemp do that?
[1:18:48.720 --> 1:18:50.720]  Why would he betray his own people?
[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:52.720]  Why would he cost himself his own election?
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:56.720]  Unless they're so confident in whatever's coming, they just figure it doesn't matter what I do.
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:18:57.720]  It doesn't matter what I say.
[1:18:57.720 --> 1:18:59.720]  It doesn't matter if the entire population hates me.
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:00.720]  This thing is coming anyway.
[1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:03.720]  So damn it all to hell.
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:04.720]  Yeah.
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:08.720]  The only thing I can think of is he's bought and paid for it, which is pretty sad.
[1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:09.720]  Yeah.
[1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:11.720]  Our governor here, Governor Abbott, betrayed us too.
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:17.720]  You know, I heard a rumor he doesn't stand for the national anthem.
[1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:18.720]  You got that one?
[1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:19.720]  That's pretty brutal.
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:20.720]  Yeah, that's pretty brutal.
[1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:21.720]  Sorry.
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:25.720]  Hey, that guy locked down my state, you know, makes me wear a face mask, so screw him.
[1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:27.720]  I don't blame you.
[1:19:27.720 --> 1:19:33.720]  But yeah, it is very worrisome that these Republicans are so willing to just throw their entire constituency under the bus.
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:35.720]  What do they know that we don't know?
[1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:37.720]  Why are they so confident to do that?
[1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:39.720]  Scares me.
[1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:42.720]  They'll pay the price.
[1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:46.720]  Well, that's for damn sure.
[1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:47.720]  Anything else, Ian?
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:49.720]  Out to the Georgia State Capitol on Saturday.
[1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:51.720]  I'll be there tomorrow.
[1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:52.720]  Right on, man.
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:53.720]  Right on.
[1:19:53.720 --> 1:19:54.720]  Alex will be there.
[1:19:54.720 --> 1:19:55.720]  Nick Fuentes will be there.
[1:19:55.720 --> 1:19:57.720]  Ollie Alexander will be there.
[1:19:57.720 --> 1:19:58.720]  Jay Dyer is there.
[1:19:58.720 --> 1:19:59.720]  It's going to be huge.
[1:19:59.720 --> 1:20:00.720]  It's going to be huge.
[1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:02.720]  Ian, thank you so much for calling in.
[1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:05.720]  Let's go to Cedric in Alabama.
[1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:07.720]  Cedric, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:08.720]  Go ahead.
[1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:10.720]  What's going on, Owens?
[1:20:10.720 --> 1:20:12.720]  God bless you, man.
[1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:13.720]  Thank you.
[1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:14.720]  God bless you.
[1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:22.720]  Listen, I'm calling upon all Republicans, all conservatives, all patriots in Alabama.
[1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:24.720]  We're right next door.
[1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:31.720]  I'm tomorrow with me to that political battlefield that is Atlanta, Georgia.
[1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:38.720]  We cannot continue to allow these political chameleons, like the governor of Alabama,
[1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:44.720]  who has said nothing in support of President Trump or any Republican, for that matter,
[1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:51.720]  in these state legislatures and these governor's mansions, now's the hour of action.
[1:20:51.720 --> 1:20:54.720]  Either you support America or you don't.
[1:20:54.720 --> 1:20:58.720]  We don't have time for these gains anymore.
[1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:02.720]  We have to rally tomorrow.
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:04.720]  Regulators mount up.
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:05.720]  Now's the time.
[1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:07.720]  America needs us.
[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:09.720]  So we need to show up.
[1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:14.720]  Either we can sit here and talk all day, or we're going to defend liberty.
[1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:20.720]  Because this is about globalism versus everyone else.
[1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:23.720]  It's just that simple, Owens.
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:28.720]  And I can't emphasize this enough, and this is not a call to action.
[1:21:28.720 --> 1:21:31.720]  This is just the truth of the matter.
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:39.720]  Folks, you can either stand up and peacefully fight for America now, maybe for two, three, maybe another year max.
[1:21:39.720 --> 1:21:42.720]  The only way to get America back after that is going to be an armed revolution.
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:43.720]  Period.
[1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:44.720]  End of sentence.
[1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:46.720]  So again, I'm not calling for that.
[1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:48.720]  I don't want to be a part of that.
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:54.720]  But rest assured, the American people will do what is necessary to save this republic.
[1:21:54.720 --> 1:22:02.720]  So you can either fight peacefully with civil disobedience and organizing and activating in the streets now,
[1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:05.720]  and sharing links and awakening your friends and family.
[1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:09.720]  Or I would say within the next year, the only way to save this country,
[1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:11.720]  if they put Kamala Harrison folks, it's game over.
[1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:12.720]  They're going to lock down everything.
[1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:14.720]  You won't even have a country anymore.
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:16.720]  And it will become an armed conflict.
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:17.720]  I don't want to see that happen.
[1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:21.720]  That's why I'm telling people to get activated now.
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:23.720]  So many things that we can do.
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:28.720]  If you can't physically be in Georgia tomorrow, you go to your state capital.
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:31.720]  There's always an excuse, but guess what?
[1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:36.720]  American Liberty is just one excuse away from tyranny.
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:39.720]  This is the fight that we were created for.
[1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:46.720]  That's why we were put here in a time as this to either stand up or to bow down.
[1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:47.720]  But guess what?
[1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:52.720]  In Alabama, our state motto is we dare defend our rights.
[1:22:52.720 --> 1:22:58.720]  As American citizens, our needs are not supposed to bend so easily.
[1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:01.720]  Stand up now politically and get active.
[1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:03.720]  Show up.
[1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:05.720]  Do the work now.
[1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:11.720]  Because in the future, it's going to be our children and our grandchildren that have to suffer
[1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:16.720]  because the excuses that we created that we made today.
[1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:17.720]  Thank you, Owen.
[1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:18.720]  Absolutely.
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:22.720]  And just look at the state of the schools right now where they're making kids wear masks,
[1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:24.720]  hide behind plexiglass barriers.
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:27.720]  That's even if they get to go to school.
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:32.720]  But again, folks, people that, I mean, they probably never even heard of Info Wars particularly
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:34.720]  in New York or California that are dealing with this tyranny.
[1:23:34.720 --> 1:23:36.720]  Folks, they are fighting mad.
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:38.720]  They don't have a voice yet.
[1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:41.720]  They're still trying to, you know, they're just dizzy from how mad they are.
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:44.720]  I mean, these people are going to realize what's going on real soon.
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:45.720]  But that's what's so scary.
[1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:47.720]  I mean, Newsome and Cuomo, they're so arrogant.
[1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:49.720]  What do they know?
[1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:54.720]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[1:23:54.720 --> 1:24:02.720]  And it's the fact that Info Wars more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying
[1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:08.720]  developed the hypothesis that Communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:12.720]  and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:16.720]  Well, now China owns the debt, now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:19.720]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on.
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:21.720]  But again, it wasn't that hard.
[1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:23.720]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing.
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:27.720]  But still others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[1:24:27.720 --> 1:24:28.720]  We did.
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:31.720]  And you focused on it by supporting us and Info Wars.
[1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:38.720]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it,
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:42.720]  you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:44.720]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:25:13.720]  I want to thank you for your support.
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:40.720]  Thank you.
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:26:06.720]  Thank you.
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:32.720]  Thank you.
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:58.720]  Thank you.
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:27.720]  Thank you.
[1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:31.720]  Here at the Alex Jones show, I've seen Phillip Anderson speak.
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:35.720]  We've got other people speaking right now live from the capital in Georgia.
[1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:37.720]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, get involved.
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:43.720]  Your state capital this Saturday at noon.
[1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:45.720]  I will be here in Austin, Texas at the state capital.
[1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:53.720]  I know there are people coming to join me, but the big event, the big rally is in Atlanta, Georgia.
[1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:57.720]  And we are just covering some of that right now with the live feed.
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:08.720]  You know, maybe it's time we all moved to South Dakota where Kristi Noem is the governor, a hero, a patriot, doesn't want to lock down her state,
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:10.720]  doesn't want to force you to wear a mask.
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:16.720]  Here she is talking about that during a press conference today.
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:22.720]  There are many states that do have mask mandates in place and some that do not.
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:28.720]  But I look at their rate of spread and the fact is that cases are increasing in many of those states as well.
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:35.720]  If you look at Wisconsin, they've had a mask mandate since August and they have a higher rate of spread than the state of South Dakota.
[1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:39.720]  You look at Montana, they've had a mask mandate in place since July.
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:44.720]  Both of those states have higher rates of spread than the state of South Dakota.
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:48.720]  When you look at Wyoming, it has the fastest spread in the nation.
[1:28:48.720 --> 1:28:58.720]  And that is the concern that I have is many times I don't want to approach a policy or a mandate just looking to make people feel good.
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:03.720]  I want to do good and actually put forward provisions that make a difference for families.
[1:29:03.720 --> 1:29:10.720]  And these local communities have some flexibility today that Sioux Falls can make a different decision than Rapid City.
[1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:13.720]  Rapid City can make a different decision than Lemon, South Dakota.
[1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:16.720]  Watertown can make a different decision than Peer.
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:24.720]  And that's what some of these local leaders are doing in reacting to the people in the community based on what they want.
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:26.720]  The best.
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:28.720]  Noam DeSantis.
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:31.720]  I mean, am I missing?
[1:29:31.720 --> 1:29:37.720]  Who's a better governor than Christie Noam or Ron DeSantis right now?
[1:29:37.720 --> 1:29:41.720]  They're leading the charge as far as I can tell.
[1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:48.720]  And it's pathetic, though, that's, I mean, like, wow, it's like, that should be normal behavior from your governor.
[1:29:48.720 --> 1:29:50.720]  But that's like considered heroic now.
[1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:54.720]  It's like, yeah, you know, I can't force people to shut down their business.
[1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:57.720]  I can't force people to wear a mask and I'm looking at the data and it doesn't even work.
[1:29:57.720 --> 1:30:01.720]  And you know what, if other cities want to run things their own way, you know, they can do that too.
[1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:02.720]  That's how it works around here.
[1:30:02.720 --> 1:30:05.720]  You're like, oh my gosh, a governor that loves freedom.
[1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:06.720]  Wow.
[1:30:06.720 --> 1:30:08.720]  A governor that wants to live in reality.
[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:09.720]  Wow.
[1:30:09.720 --> 1:30:11.720]  That's a pirate for a governor.
[1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:13.720]  Oh, thank God.
[1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:15.720]  So we did all just, we did all just move to South Dakota.
[1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:18.720]  Everybody just moved to Florida.
[1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:23.720]  Man, I'll tell you, if I didn't hate winter, I probably moved to South Dakota tomorrow.
[1:30:23.720 --> 1:30:24.720]  I'm not even kidding you.
[1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:25.720]  I just hate winter.
[1:30:25.720 --> 1:30:26.720]  I cannot deal with it.
[1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:27.720]  I don't like winter.
[1:30:27.720 --> 1:30:29.720]  I'd rather be 100 degrees all year long.
[1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:30.720]  All right.
[1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:31.720]  I'm getting off track.
[1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:35.720]  Let's get back to your phone calls.
[1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:38.720]  And we have Jamie in North Dakota.
[1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:39.720]  Jamie, Alex Jones show.
[1:30:39.720 --> 1:30:40.720]  Go ahead.
[1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:41.720]  Hi.
[1:30:41.720 --> 1:30:47.720]  I wanted to speak to, first of all, all of us in the Midwest who think this can't affect
[1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:48.720]  us.
[1:30:48.720 --> 1:30:53.720]  And also to reach out to the mothers out there because you guys do a really great job, but
[1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:58.720]  I really want mothers to hear what's going on in our little, our little state of North
[1:30:58.720 --> 1:30:59.720]  Dakota.
[1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:01.720]  We have 765,000 residents.
[1:31:01.720 --> 1:31:07.720]  And of course, as soon as Doug Burgum was reelected, he threw down a mask mandate and said that
[1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:10.320]  our kids needed to go to school with it.
[1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:12.720]  Everybody started freaking out about $1,000 fine.
[1:31:12.720 --> 1:31:17.720]  But what they're missing was that statute that they cited was a class C felony.
[1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:22.720]  Now, the people that are going to rise up against that are conservatives, right?
[1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:26.480]  So basically, if you get slapped with that fine, they're taking away your right to vote
[1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:27.720]  and your right to have guns.
[1:31:27.720 --> 1:31:30.440]  That's the first thing that I want to point out.
[1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:33.440]  Once they slapped that on the kids at school, I was done.
[1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:35.400]  I went and I called the state senator.
[1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:38.680]  I talked to the senator and he said that his hands were kind of tied.
[1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:43.920]  And what had happened was, today, there's an article about how horrible we are up here,
[1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:49.040]  which we're not, by the way, we have 289 people in the hospital.
[1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:50.040]  That is it.
[1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:55.120]  And the whole thing, the fact that we even talk about it like it's a real issue is a
[1:31:55.120 --> 1:31:57.120]  scythe in and of itself.
[1:31:57.120 --> 1:31:58.120]  It's the flu.
[1:31:58.120 --> 1:31:59.440]  It's, I mean, name anything.
[1:31:59.440 --> 1:32:00.680]  You don't lock down for anything.
[1:32:00.680 --> 1:32:02.720]  We don't lock down for tuberculosis.
[1:32:02.720 --> 1:32:04.800]  We don't lock down for Ebola.
[1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:05.800]  You don't lock.
[1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:07.040]  I mean, so it's just, why COVID?
[1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:08.280]  It's all a big sham.
[1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:10.920]  It's all a big plan, scammedemic.
[1:32:10.920 --> 1:32:15.280]  Now all of the sexual stuff you've been talking about, this is another warning I want to go
[1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:16.280]  out.
[1:32:16.280 --> 1:32:17.280]  It can happen anywhere.
[1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:22.360]  When I signed my son up for school, I talked to her about these sexual lessons coming into
[1:32:22.360 --> 1:32:23.360]  their school.
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:24.680]  They said, no, we're so conservative.
[1:32:24.680 --> 1:32:25.680]  That would never happen.
[1:32:25.680 --> 1:32:31.640]  I'm going to read you one line from my son's first week of school that I found in his backpack.
[1:32:31.640 --> 1:32:36.920]  Jonah's mother explained that all people develop sexual desires, which they need to control
[1:32:36.920 --> 1:32:39.520]  by taking pills.
[1:32:39.520 --> 1:32:40.520]  Are you okay with that?
[1:32:40.520 --> 1:32:42.400]  Cause I'm not.
[1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:47.360]  So not only are they sexualizing your kid, they're also wanting to turn them into a drug
[1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:48.360]  addict.
[1:32:48.360 --> 1:32:53.320]  Well, and take pills, which will probably, you know, affect their reproductive ability
[1:32:53.320 --> 1:32:55.360]  in the future, which means they won't reproduce.
[1:32:55.360 --> 1:32:57.640]  There's so many things going on.
[1:32:57.640 --> 1:32:59.200]  People are not looking into this.
[1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:03.200]  The mothers, especially across the Midwest, need to have a voice.
[1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:07.080]  If you want me to be that voice, you just let me know because I know this stuff inside
[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:08.080]  now.
[1:33:08.080 --> 1:33:10.520]  You guys do a great job, but we need to reach some women.
[1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:13.760]  We need to reach some mothers and let them know what's going on inside of you.
[1:33:13.760 --> 1:33:18.160]  Well, ma'am, I completely agree and you are very well spoken and obviously have a deep
[1:33:18.160 --> 1:33:19.400]  understanding of these issues.
[1:33:19.400 --> 1:33:20.960]  Here's the problem, Jamie.
[1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:23.880]  I don't even have the crew to go do an event tomorrow.
[1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:28.160]  So like we have so many great people that call in and we have so many great people that,
[1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:29.480]  you know, reach out via email.
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:30.840]  They have all these great ideas.
[1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:32.360]  I wish I could do all of them.
[1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:33.680]  It'd be all massive success.
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:34.680]  We don't have the capacity.
[1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:38.680]  So Jamie, my suggestion is start a YouTube channel, start an account on Parler.
[1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:39.680]  Start something.
[1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:40.680]  Start doing your own thing.
[1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:44.280]  Maybe we start picking up your reports, playing them during some of the segments.
[1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:46.880]  Because again, people, people come to me with great ideas, Jamie.
[1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:47.880]  God bless your heart.
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:50.400]  You're very well spoken and we need this information out there.
[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:54.760]  It's just we can't even, we can't even do half the stuff we need to do around here right
[1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:55.760]  now.
[1:33:55.760 --> 1:34:00.560]  So, you know, like I said, just the best bet is to just do stuff yourself and then hope
[1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:02.440]  that we pick it up and amplify it.
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:05.680]  And then that's kind of the osmosis of success around here.
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:06.680]  Jamie, God bless you.
[1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:07.680]  Thank you so much for the call.
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:09.000]  I hope I hear from Jamie again.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  Let's go to Carlos in Texas.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:12.800]  Carlos, you're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:34:12.800 --> 1:34:13.800]  Go ahead.
[1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:14.800]  All right.
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:15.800]  Hello, Owen.
[1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:16.800]  20 years old here.
[1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:17.800]  Long time listeners in middle school.
[1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:22.120]  And I wanted to cover a couple of topics, mainly with beginning with China.
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:28.840]  On November 11th, China deployed a DEW, which is a direct energy weapon against India, making
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:30.800]  them inside of a mountain and making them run out.
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:31.800]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:34.280]  I have to, I just want to pause you right there because I got to tell the crew to look
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:35.280]  this up.
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:39.600]  This is one of the craziest things that Carlos has talked about this.
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:42.800]  I didn't really see it covered in any mainstream news, so I'm a little skeptical, but there
[1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:51.120]  are pictures of China using basically a mass microwave energy beam weapon to just vaporize
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:58.000]  an entire squadron of Indian, of Indian soldiers, but Carlos, I just wanted to tell the crew
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  to try to look that up.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.520]  So go back, start from the beginning, what you're talking about here.
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:05.280]  The regardless if it's true or not, they are still researching how to use these direct
[1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:09.640]  energy weapons and they are deploying them in space, my theory, you know, and I think
[1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:13.400]  that Trump knows that that's why he created the space force like last year, I think.
[1:35:13.400 --> 1:35:14.400]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:18.680]  Well, they came out with a Pentagon report that China is already implementing and deploying
[1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:22.760]  weather weapons, I suspect that they're hitting us with these hurricanes in the South that
[1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:24.240]  are unnaturally forming.
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:25.960]  Dude, yeah, definitely.
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:29.040]  But at the same time, the United States is doing the same research with DARPA and other
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:30.680]  organizations within our own government.
[1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:32.960]  And I think they've been using against the people.
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:37.880]  And along with the China thing, and like not just these direct energy weapons, are they
[1:35:37.880 --> 1:35:41.480]  deploying on the people, but they're also creating or committing crimes against humanity
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:47.520]  that the UN knows about, the United States knows about leaders, global leaders know about
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:49.600]  this and they do nothing to stand up to China.
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:52.440]  They are afraid of China because China owns them.
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:53.440]  They own our debt.
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:54.440]  They own everything.
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:59.520]  And they're moving slowly towards owning Hong Kong and Taiwan every day and nobody stands
[1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:04.320]  up to them because they know that if they were to do that, then it would just be World
[1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:05.320]  War III.
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:06.320]  All right.
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:10.560]  And my second point that I wanted to get to was that Trump needs to stop playing into
[1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:11.840]  the game, dude.
[1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:16.960]  Trump is, Trump should have ended this a long time ago.
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:19.960]  I don't, I think that we need to stop having so much faith in Trump.
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:25.320]  You know, he keeps playing into the game, the vaccine, the mask, all that is BS, man.
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:26.320]  Yeah.
[1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:30.240]  Well, we're going to have to find out in the next three months whether or not we continue
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:32.320]  to rely on Trump or anything.
[1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:36.040]  Either he's the president for the next four years and we can kind of, you know, continue
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:39.560]  to try to move things in the right direction with Trump or he's not even the president
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:43.160]  and we have to move on without him and he'll have to blaze his own show from there.
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:47.360]  But Carlos, a 20-year-old in Texas, wow, very well-spoken Carlos, thank you for calling.
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:52.120]  President Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of America.
[1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:54.040]  He really was telling the truth.
[1:36:54.040 --> 1:36:57.240]  They don't just work for the Communist Chinese and the globalists and the EU and the whole
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:00.280]  Hollywood, America hating, God hating crew.
[1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:06.320]  They literally say that they are in control of our minds and believe they do own us and
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:10.640]  tell us who the president is, even though that's not in law and they're just gaslighting
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:15.320]  the whole public over and over again saying Joe Biden is president-elect, repeating it
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:19.520]  over and over again like a brainwashing mantra when it's up again to the state government
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:22.880]  to certify those votes and those votes for being challenged, there's massive evidence
[1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:23.880]  of fraud.
[1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:26.760]  Again, this is so incredibly clear.
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:29.880]  Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front, that, oh, we're going to
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:33.360]  challenge the vote no matter what until every vote's counted.
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:36.760]  Well, a lot of votes haven't been counted and there's massive fraud being discovered.
[1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:40.840]  So we're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a Communist Chinese agent.
[1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:41.840]  He's a globalist.
[1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:42.840]  He wants carbon taxes.
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:47.000]  He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:48.840]  This is war.
[1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:53.040]  Remember Hillary Clinton, remember Pelosi, remember Bill Clinton, remember Obama, all
[1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:57.840]  of them said, we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:00.160]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win in the landslide because they
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:01.760]  had the internal polls.
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:06.600]  And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:13.000]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze the seven states on election night
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.680]  and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:16.680]  This is completely transparent.
[1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:19.760]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:20.760]  Trump has not conceded.
[1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:23.960]  None of the states have certified the vote and now all these investigations have been
[1:38:23.960 --> 1:38:29.200]  opened up and avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:32.160]  been documented in Georgia.
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:34.360]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:36.640]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:40.600]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed.
[1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:44.080]  But now this is the mother of all hoaxes and if they get away with this, it's the end
[1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:45.080]  of America as we know it.
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:50.280]  We will be Venezuela in full wars.com.
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:55.400]  The great moment of truth this year, America discovered the last five, six years that we
[1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:59.800]  have run under globalist control and the traitors in both parties that sold us out to
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:04.280]  Congress, China and multinational corporations and we're establishing an authoritarian anti-American
[1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:05.280]  system.
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:09.560]  Well, now they've launched their counter assault and through fraud are trying to fuel
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:14.760]  the election right now and complete the police state takeover by bankrupting the people of
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:20.520]  the United States but also the entire world to bring us to our knees under the great reset.

[1:40:52.760 --> 1:41:10.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:16.640]  That is a live shot from Atlanta Georgia where Alex is rallying the troops again let's briefly
[1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:23.640]  pop in live.
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:47.080]  We need the governor not to listen to the other operatives in the state we demand the
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:42:02.760]  emergency session now so again this is in Atlanta Georgia where the democrats are trying
[1:42:02.760 --> 1:42:07.640]  to steal the state of Georgia or I guess you could say already have stolen it they declared
[1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:15.080]  it for Biden he didn't win it but this is the tyranny we're in folks this is the corrupt
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:21.600]  establishment going for broke and they're betting that we the American people will sit
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:36.080]  here and take it and so far they've been right but the momentum is growing in our favor but
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:45.360]  now it's just a race through time who can get to the point of no return first will it
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:54.720]  be them the world government enslavement tyrannical forces or will it be us we the people for
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:43:00.320]  human freedom and liberty worldwide let's go back out to the phone lines Jesse in Arizona
[1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:06.440]  Jesse you're on the air go ahead I like what you were saying earlier about Obama seem pretty
[1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:13.000]  smug and you're not liking that and I've agreed this whole folks are most of the way through
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:20.400]  the Obama Colbert whoever it is gates and his wife they seem awfully confident and we
[1:43:20.400 --> 1:43:25.200]  got to keep our eyes on the ball I hear we got a fight we got to stay in the park the
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:29.960]  fight's been one for 2000 years we got to keep our eyes on the way the truth in the
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:34.240]  life that is Jesus Christ because at the end of the day we're all going to be judged by
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:41.040]  God alone and it doesn't matter whether we're bullhorning and we've got 12 years of food
[1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:46.760]  buried and guns up the wazoo or whether we're Bill Gates it's by faith alone and not of
[1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:52.200]  works and I think people are missing that in this because it's working for biblical prophecy
[1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:58.080]  to be filled America must fall the one world system whether it's you know Biden gets in
[1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:03.160]  and it's a shoe in or whether Trump you know has his master plan for a few years or whatever
[1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:08.520]  it is or maybe Trump's unintentionally a sophisticated controlled opposition program no matter what
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:13.080]  it comes down to Jesus Christ at the end of the day there at the end of our lives and
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:18.080]  it's not by anything we do or don't do it's by faith alone purely and I don't hear that
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:23.280]  mentioned enough I'm not putting finger on anybody particular just in the world because
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:31.360]  I think this is the message that people need to hear anything else Jesse nope that's it
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:39.240]  for now alright thank you so much for the call there's no doubt that when America lost
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:45.080]  its touch with God and its Christian roots it definitely went in a bad direction and
[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:50.360]  you know I was thinking about this actually really deeply last night and I realize how
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:45:00.160]  Christianity is actually under such assault right now and we don't even really see it
[1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:08.800]  but what happened was so there's this new thing I guess restaurants are doing and it's
[1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:13.840]  LGBTQ friendly and it's a whole new thing you get a little patch you get a little badge
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:22.440]  they put on your Google profile LGBTQ friendly it's like a new thing okay and I went to pick
[1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:32.120]  up some carry out last night and I had a shirt on that had Jesus Christ on it and I'm ordering
[1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:36.800]  the food and I see all LGBTQ friendly and I'm wearing my shirt that has Jesus on it
[1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:46.000]  and I'm thinking huh would they deny me service because I'm a Christian and it hit like the
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:53.920]  gears mesh right there this whole tolerance open sexuality gay you know bisexual transsexual
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:46:01.720]  whatever dolphin sexual just the total perversion of normal human behavior and biology it's actually
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:07.320]  at its roots and attack on Christianity these people know it's all bogus they know it's
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:13.480]  all it's all it's all BS 99.9% of us won't even care whether you're gay straight bi transsexual
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:19.600]  never even have any interaction with that other than what they're forcing on us but
[1:46:19.600 --> 1:46:28.440]  I realize now that that whole LGBTQ and everything else is all really just an attack on Christianity
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:34.280]  folks because they want to be able to say because you're a Christian you're a bigot they
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:40.440]  want to be able to say because you love Jesus you're a bigot that's their plan and so you
[1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:45.080]  bring in the tolerance oh a tolerance of a gay guy oh a tolerance of this oh a tolerance
[1:46:45.080 --> 1:46:51.080]  of a transsexual oh a tolerance of a pedophile and entrench it and then corporatize it so
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:55.600]  then you can't even go into a restaurant or a business with a crucifix on your neck or
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:47:00.600]  Jesus on your shirt because that's considered offensive that's the attack on Christianity
[1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:04.720]  that's what's really at the root of this and if you can destroy that Christian ethos in
[1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:14.200]  the West the West dies so it's all an attack on Christianity folks and I'm I predict if
[1:47:14.200 --> 1:47:19.680]  they get their way and they get Biden in within a year wearing anything with Jesus on it or
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:24.520]  a crucifix will be considered hate speech mark my words it'll be considered hate speech
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:29.800]  you will see Alex Jones has just gotten boots on the ground in front of the state capital
[1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:34.400]  there in Georgia let's pop in real quick on a live feed he's got Enrique Tario with him
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:40.120]  there Fuentes is there you have a bunch of people the movement continues to grow and
[1:47:40.120 --> 1:47:43.880]  then ultimately tomorrow it's going to be the big one and they're getting the big guy
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:49.000]  over the fence there not an easy task but they got him on over the barrier there so
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:55.480]  it looks like they've began to move on to the actual capital grounds where they weren't
[1:47:55.480 --> 1:48:01.600]  allowed before and so I think Alex is probably about to get on a bullhorn there and make
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:06.720]  a statement guys can I get that feedback up
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:28.440]  and now the head of the Davos group the head of the UN the British Prime Minister the Canadian
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:34.400]  Prime Minister the German Chancellor including John Kerry the former Secretary of State
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:43.920]  are all in the news today saying the COVID-19 lockdown is designed to crush populism and
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:48.360]  to teach Americans and folks in the UK that won out of the new world war and out of the
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:54.320]  EU that we are their slaves they are literally bragging now that they did the whole COVID
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:49:02.360]  exaggerated hoax as a pretext to crush us and make us submit and I know that now that
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:07.120]  these arrogant bastards are out the open that we the people are awake and they're not going
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:08.120]  to put up with us
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:12.720]  and you know think about this there's a couple hundred people out there there should be a
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:17.760]  couple hundred thousand people out there folks you understand I know you understand this
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:26.400]  but it's so hard because it's so overwhelming they literally faked a worldwide pandemic
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:33.400]  to launch a great reset now look everybody understands how corrupt things have become
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:39.640]  the financial markets the trade bubbles the debt the wars all of it it's out of control
[1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:44.320]  and the only way to really fix it is to basically hit the reset button the problem is the great
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:50.200]  reset isn't hitting the reset button on all these bubbles and markets and nation states
[1:49:50.200 --> 1:49:55.760]  and then collapsing them into a one world government no that's the great enslavement
[1:49:55.760 --> 1:50:03.800]  the great reset is arresting the criminals that's the great reset the great reset is
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:11.400]  Obama and Biden jail the bushes jail the Clintons jail continue to jail the corrupt politicians
[1:50:11.400 --> 1:50:20.240]  in Argentina and Brazil Merkel McCron anybody who signed on to any global agenda selling
[1:50:20.240 --> 1:50:26.120]  their nation state down the drain jail that's the great reset but see they make it all a
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:31.480]  game where everybody knows it has to be reset but they reset it so that the big worldwide
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:38.280]  criminals who stole everything then are perched on top of us forever and then hide all their
[1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:42.720]  criminal behavior and make us all slaves you see the Democrats now calling to put us in
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:46.800]  gulags you see the Democrats now putting out their lists saying these are all the people

[1:50:56.160 --> 1:51:01.920]  the entire planet what is your only out to jail everybody throw everybody in jail that's
[1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:08.040]  what they're doing that's their plan that's the alleged quote unquote great reset but
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:14.480]  no if we are victorious and humanity is victorious the great reset will mean all these corrupt
[1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:20.920]  world leaders that have been robbing us blind and lying and deceiving and dividing us for
[1:51:20.920 --> 1:51:26.920]  decades all in jail that's the great reset arrest the criminal cabal arrest the global

[1:52:45.320 --> 1:52:51.720]  all hired a year ago and then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay
[1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:56.960]  locked down during a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations and they talk
[1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:01.560]  about calling people heroes that do it they talk about shaming those that don't this is
[1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:07.160]  all been psychologically tested it's all been psychologically prepared and once they get
[1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:11.320]  it locked down for 15 days you notice now they say it's permanent that's how it works
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:16.480]  oh just put these handcuffs on the serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything
[1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:22.320]  will be alright no now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killers
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:28.920]  van he's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death that's the allegory
[1:53:28.920 --> 1:53:32.760]  we got a bust out of this thing now we got to say no now we got to make a run for it
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:36.840]  now and we still can't once he gets us in that basement it's going to get a lot lot
[1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:59.160]  worse folks so stop submitting you're listening to the Alex Jones show bring to the third
[1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:05.840]  hour of the Alex Jones show I want to go back to your phone calls again Alex is in Atlanta
[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:10.920]  Georgia at the Capitol at a stop the steel rally tomorrow at noon is the big one in Atlanta
[1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:17.200]  but noon at every state Capitol every Saturday until Trump is reelected is the plan for now
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:25.080]  I'll be out in Austin Texas tomorrow at noon going back to the phone lines now Sam in Indiana
[1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:30.400]  Sam you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead yeah first of all I want to thank you for
[1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:36.880]  all your good work that you and Alex do and the supplements you guys have are unbelievable
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:42.680]  I use them for all the bodybuilding it's unbelievable my point quickly is I heard you guys discuss
[1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:48.680]  a trucker strike and I think that has a lot of merit also something else that we could
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:54.760]  do is the idea is called the great set aside and it's probably 80 to 100 million people
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:55:00.360]  out there that we know for sure to support President Trump and the way you can get back
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:06.640]  without having any violence or anything like that is the ability to set all your tax money
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:11.640]  aside you still file the forms you still stay in compliance with the forms but what you
[1:55:11.640 --> 1:55:17.720]  do is Patriots you have 1776 and you set the money aside and you defund the federal government
[1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:22.680]  to keep the money locally and that's how you fight back non violence and that combined
[1:55:22.680 --> 1:55:27.200]  with the trucker strike is a way to send the message to the globalists that number one
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:33.920]  you weaponize IRS you weaponize our Justice Department you weaponize our CIA you weaponize
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:40.880]  our FBI you take away our ability to have a fair transparent election so now what we
[1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:46.360]  do is we simply turn the money off and we defund the federal government and set the
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:52.320]  money aside until we see structural changes and we can believe in what we're funding
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:56.840]  that simple and I agree trucker strike I agree with that notion the problem is we can't even
[1:55:56.840 --> 1:56:02.600]  get people to take off a mask Sam so you think they're going to be able to pull off something
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:06.400]  like that I just don't see it being possible they won't even take off the mask but the
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:10.640]  trucker strike I was told I think it was like November 29 was the original date I saw I
[1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:15.200]  don't know if anything's been cemented there but they're the truckers are going to planning
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:20.840]  plan on shutting down DC they don't announce Trump the winner soon I appreciate everything
[1:56:20.840 --> 1:56:24.400]  you do but now is the time that we have to fight and if we could get some of the big
[1:56:24.400 --> 1:56:31.000]  media the right wing media to band together and if we all banded together we could turn
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:35.880]  the system off and take control of it and defund it I do agree it's always kind of been
[1:56:35.880 --> 1:56:41.000]  a problem it's like hurting cats but maybe maybe we're on the way Todd in California
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:45.920]  Todd in California and you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead awesome Owen really great
[1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:50.880]  to be able to talk to you man love love listening to you on the show and I really enjoy all
[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:56.520]  the products that you guys have I take a couple of myself next to I don't really great I just
[1:56:56.520 --> 1:57:01.560]  want to say I really think that for one I think that Trump might be hiding hopefully
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:09.040]  because he's thinking about enacting the insurrection act and you know everything they do over there
[1:57:09.040 --> 1:57:14.080]  seems to get out to the wrong people within the Democratic Party so I mean before we know
[1:57:14.080 --> 1:57:18.280]  about it they're gonna know about it and they're gonna be plotting and if he's really thinking
[1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:22.120]  about doing that they could be thinking about trying to kill him especially with everything
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:27.040]  else that's been going on yeah there's no doubt there's some strategic move here by
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:31.560]  President Trump to stay in the shadows and pretty much be the non the unseen president
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:38.600]  since the election he used the words in the beginning the calm before the storm and I
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:44.840]  truly believed that he is he also said hey you may not be seeing me for a while that's
[1:57:44.840 --> 1:57:50.560]  exactly right that sounds strategic as hell it really does the main reason I was also
[1:57:50.560 --> 1:57:54.640]  calling is because the media and Facebook and all these other companies they keep on
[1:57:54.640 --> 1:58:01.280]  trying to say that there's a president elect when Congress issued a letter officially stating
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:09.720]  on November 13th that there is no president elect Congress did and against fake news fake
[1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:13.280]  fake everything they fake everything man you know that Todd they fake rush inclusion fake
[1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:18.320]  hate crimes fake pandemics fake elections now all they know is the fake but we need to go
[1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:22.160]  on with them the president needs to go in with the military and I just want to I just
[1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:28.000]  want to him everything up by saying that maybe Trump should think about investing in info
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:32.480]  wars because they're thinking about purchasing a new show well you know what it's time to
[1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:38.280]  invest in info wars you guys are hard-hitting you get the message out you aspire other other
[1:58:38.280 --> 1:58:41.720]  podcast yeah I think the way the White House looks at info wars is we're just like the
[1:58:41.720 --> 1:58:48.720]  wild dog we're just off the chain off the leash and they just let this dog hunt big tech isn't
[1:58:48.720 --> 1:59:01.440]  league with the globalist and the child cops and when we take this country back they must
[1:59:01.440 --> 1:59:06.480]  be held accountable the waiting is over the fight is now out the open world government
[1:59:06.480 --> 1:59:11.920]  is here in the latter part of 2020 is attempting to collapse the world economy set up a global
[1:59:11.920 --> 1:59:17.440]  digital currency and AI surveillance system and info wars he's on the front lines fighting
[1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:21.680]  harder than ever and we pledge to you to never back down and never give up in the face of
[1:59:21.680 --> 1:59:27.440]  this evil because we know God is watching and God is in charge and God is on our side
[1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:31.880]  info wars can only stay in the fight and continue to be the tip of the spear if you financially

[2:00:30.520 --> 2:00:37.920]  I hope you can join me then let me just go back out to the phone lines here because if
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:44.080]  I start getting into this news and start covering it folks I mean I you know I just don't want
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:50.120]  to talk like that okay we all know what's going on all right we all know that that gut
[2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:59.640]  instinct we all know we all know how to scratch that itch but it's just not really graceful
[2:00:59.640 --> 2:01:05.560]  or becoming here on air so let me go back to the phone lines and go to Emmerich in FEMA
[2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:10.640]  region to Emmerich you're on the Alex Jones show go ahead I first I'd like to plug the
[2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:19.040]  x2 grease product great great product I find it very powerful but I did it with a five
[2:01:19.040 --> 2:01:27.760]  day cleanse and it was very very powerful under that it was a five day five day fasting
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:33.640]  cleanse and it gave me energy great product you know what I think I'm going to hit the
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:42.320]  x2 right now actually thank you for reminding me I want to talk about was uh you know hopefully
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:49.040]  we're going to win this but you know we need contingent plans so we need to call on patriots
[2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:58.480]  especially from blue states to move to the the swing states and if that doesn't work
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:06.400]  the end we we're going to have to make a coalition of red states that is going to have to separate
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:10.800]  and just let the blue states collapse on their own I think we have to come up if we're going
[2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:15.080]  to do something like this and quite frankly it's all kind of pipe dreamish but I think
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:19.480]  the best way to handle that would be just to give the democrats what they think is the
[2:02:19.480 --> 2:02:27.760]  greatest thing ever and just let them have Los Angeles and New York and Chicago and um
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:30.600]  you know a couple of their major cities that they want to run and then basically just secede
[2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:34.160]  from them like there's this thing out there called the great Idaho proposal I mean again
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:39.120]  it's all pipe dreamish I really think it's unreal to even consider any of this we have
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:43.280]  to overturn this corrupt system altogether you can try to create new states or new coalitions
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:50.840]  or all this stuff it won't matter globalism will squash all of it I mean it is definitely
[2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:57.520]  hard but California alone you cut the cancer that's 55 electoral votes hey I agree let them
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:01.680]  burn California to the ground they're already doing it why should we all suffer but we've
[2:03:01.680 --> 2:03:05.160]  already passed see that's a problem we've already passed the opportunity for all of
[2:03:05.160 --> 2:03:10.280]  these things to actually work it's now it's globalism it's liberty or death at this point
[2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:16.000]  there's no all these other plans it's the final level liberty or death do we have elections
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:20.400]  do we have a country do we have freedoms I mean that's everything we can try to plan
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:24.080]  out all these other intricate plans and stuff it's just it's too late Emmerich I'm sorry
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:27.680]  to say it's just I'd again I'd love to give them give them New York California let them
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:31.480]  communists those states into the ground so we can show how dumb it is so we can show
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:35.400]  how destructive it is it won't matter globalism squashes all of it it's not even about communism
[2:03:35.400 --> 2:03:40.800]  it's about globalism it's about the world one world government it's very difficult I
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:47.920]  mean I'm in FEMA region to myself when you live here you're bound to no liberal people
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:54.400]  and they don't they won't even listen it's you can't they say oh fake news and it's it's
[2:03:54.400 --> 2:04:00.440]  hard to get through them I try but liberalism is a mental disorder it is it really is and
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:06.240]  it's just brainwashing is really what it is I appreciate the time is great talking to
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:11.080]  you thank you for the call Emmerich let's go to Brian in New Hampshire Brian you're
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:18.720]  on the air go ahead hey what's up what's going on man just going to talk real quick
[2:04:18.720 --> 2:04:26.920]  about my used to be great state of New Hampshire and our cuck of a governor who just put a statewide
[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:32.960]  mask mandate after you know a while of not up to this whole time we thought he was a
[2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:38.000]  great patriot you know we thought better of him and he just came out with a with a mask
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:46.440]  mandate so a mask that doesn't even do anything but spread the boxes it doesn't do anything
[2:04:46.440 --> 2:04:53.920]  it's so ridiculous that people are this this come down it's bad you know but uh real quick
[2:04:53.920 --> 2:05:00.280]  that I was trying to say uh well he's doing these every Saturday with the Capitol Concord
[2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:06.080]  and on the 28th of November we will be out there doing a anti-mask rally and we're going
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:10.440]  to be pushing to the governor's mansion so everyone in New Hampshire Massachusetts surrounding
[2:05:10.440 --> 2:05:16.240]  states come join us out there please and uh you know let's just take these last two efforts
[2:05:16.240 --> 2:05:21.000]  and this this thing around I mean because what's next what's next I mean if people are going
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:27.320]  to wear the mask they're going to take these inoculate yep bottom line and uh I'm not
[2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:31.120]  for it and that's what I'm saying like people call in there's all kinds of great ideas maybe
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:34.960]  they'll work to save the republic maybe they won't you really think you can organize a
[2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:39.040]  hundred million two hundred three hundred million americans to stop paying taxes or do
[2:05:39.040 --> 2:05:44.960]  one thing or the other but you can't even get a city to take off a mask you got to be
[2:05:44.960 --> 2:05:50.800]  realistic here brian thank you so much for the call axel in texas axel you're on the
[2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:56.600]  alex joneshow go ahead hey there oh and uh been a big fan since the engage liberty days

[2:06:08.240 --> 2:06:13.440]  I called in mostly in 2015 if I remember right but it was uh on youtube watching a lot back
[2:06:13.440 --> 2:06:17.760]  then obviously you've grown quite a bit since then so yeah they banned me everywhere now
[2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:22.560]  so that's an honor well that's funny because that's really what I want to talk about in
[2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:28.960]  a different way I'm a I'm a lawyer up in uh Dallas and what I wanted to say is that we're
[2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:35.400]  watching an immense growth of cancel culture okay we're at a moment right now where president
[2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:41.800]  trump about a month ago had some real hard hitting really powerful lawyers on his team
[2:06:41.800 --> 2:06:46.840]  and what we've seen in the last couple weeks is that a lot of them have withdrawn who are
[2:06:46.840 --> 2:06:52.760]  those lawyers and well some of the lawyers I know one was porter right they're a big
[2:06:52.760 --> 2:06:58.160]  firm uh that's a nationally respected firm they ended up withdrawing they got too much
[2:06:58.160 --> 2:07:03.840]  uh flak within the firm is my understanding so basically trump tries to get legal teams
[2:07:03.840 --> 2:07:08.880]  and then democrats flood their phone calls with threatening messages you got it and you
[2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:13.880]  know look to understand where they're coming from I mean a lot of these folks at these bigger
[2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:21.040]  firms are you an attorney axle I am okay I am and what I want to say is uh look I've
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:24.920]  seen how these firms work and I mean a lot of them are real great people but they have
[2:07:24.920 --> 2:07:29.360]  a very powerful left leaning world view I mean it's just if you look at the demographics
[2:07:29.360 --> 2:07:34.720]  of lawyers that's where they're at well if we have cancel culture that's getting so
[2:07:34.720 --> 2:07:38.760]  extreme that I've even the president of the United States can pick his own lawyer I mean
[2:07:38.760 --> 2:07:44.920]  we got problems and so what I wanted to say was I think it's up to everyday people to
[2:07:44.920 --> 2:07:49.480]  to make your voice heard you know you you can't just hide in the shadows with your opinions
[2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:53.920]  on your world view I mean you got to put your mouth where your heart is you got to put your
[2:07:53.920 --> 2:07:58.200]  butt in seats where your where your heart is and you got to put your money where your
[2:07:58.200 --> 2:08:02.880]  heart is because if you don't do that a lot of these establishment folks just are going
[2:08:02.880 --> 2:08:08.440]  to think that uh doing some of these things that should be pretty uh pretty middle the
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:12.520]  road unobjectionable they're going to start thinking that these things are some wild right
[2:08:12.520 --> 2:08:17.080]  wing deal well I'm sorry but representing the president of the United States should
[2:08:17.080 --> 2:08:22.960]  not be some wild right wing thing that should get you know you cancel cultured out I mean
[2:08:22.960 --> 2:08:28.840]  and you shouldn't have to deal with a liberal mafia of terrorists coming after you anytime
[2:08:28.840 --> 2:08:32.360]  you want to make a move just because they don't like you or they don't like the person
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:38.840]  you're representing it's a cult the democrats and and liberals have turned into a cult again
[2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:41.840]  it's the biggest hate group and the biggest tear group in the United States actual thank
[2:08:41.840 --> 2:08:45.960]  you so much for that call real quick before we go to break let's pop in 60 seconds Alex
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:52.960]  Jones bullhorning in Atlanta
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:34.920]  so it appears Alex is currently meeting in March from the state capitol building in Atlanta
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:40.440]  perhaps to the governor's mansion we'll continue to monitor that and give you updates and take
[2:09:40.440 --> 2:09:48.200]  your calls when you come back urgent warnings are being issued right now by the united nations
[2:09:48.200 --> 2:09:52.880]  the devos group bank of america jp morgan chase holman sacks they're saying that the
[2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:57.720]  covid virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to start the death
[2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:03.000]  incredible they're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:08.080]  causing the chain reaction that's causing the mass formation not the covid virus that
[2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:13.480]  is a fact and all the hero's sheep where the mask to go along with this are signing on
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:18.240]  to mass murder bigger than what Hitler did that's when we got the Geneva convention and
[2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:25.080]  the Nuremberg code this is a medical world government tyrannical takeover causing starvation
[2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:30.040]  setting up world IDs and coming with forced inoculations and now back in america says
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:35.480]  global unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression that stories on info wars dot com
[2:10:35.480 --> 2:10:39.680]  that's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you're not stand for this
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:46.360]  or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary greatly set most of the world
[2:10:46.360 --> 2:10:51.680]  submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the comics chinese and
[2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:56.720]  the united nations and now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient the
[2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:01.560]  worst australian models of complete lockdown so you can't even leave your house for months
[2:11:01.560 --> 2:11:06.760]  and months are being announced and in germany the police are using giant armored tanks with
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:12.200]  water cannons to blast men women and children that protest the fact that merkel the dictator
[2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:16.480]  has put them under her control that's right she's been ringing elections for years and
[2:11:16.480 --> 2:11:21.560]  years and the same thing is coming here to the united states this is world government
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:26.400]  in philadelphia they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested they're
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:30.720]  announcing the christmas is cancelled this is what the communists takeover looks like
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:36.360]  to bankrupt you to take rid of all your due process and absolutely transform the world
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:42.240]  into a prison planet how long have we warned you about this but you can fight back america
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:12:05.880]  is the last bastion stop submitting you're listening to the alex jones show so we've
[2:12:05.880 --> 2:12:10.840]  got recounts underway in wisconsin in georgia i just feel that quite frankly my opinion
[2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:21.480]  is it's a worthless task the voting machines must be investigated and shut down and and
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:27.720]  quite frankly we just have to declare any election held on dominion voting machines
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:33.840]  or with smartmatic technology must be nullified and redone that's the only way to stop this
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:40.200]  folks that's it now we can use our constitutional powers in the states to say look we're going
[2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:47.680]  to send the delegates for trump he won these states they're not going to do that so the
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:50.600]  recounts are nice i don't think it's going to change anything folks i wouldn't get your
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:55.920]  hope uh hoped up on a recount unless they audit the vote or declare any election done
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:13:03.280]  on dominion hammer and scorecard or smartmatic to be null and void it's the only way that's
[2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:10.320]  it and cindy pal knows it that's why they're focusing on that and want to get it in front
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:13.560]  of the supreme court with all these sworn affidavits of people who work for the voting
[2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:19.080]  companies who said yeah we we designed it to cheat we we sold it to buy you know think
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:36.000]  about this how much money is spent on political campaigns in any given election cycle a couple
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:42.720]  billion give or take two three four billion probably think about all that money all that
[2:13:42.720 --> 2:13:48.440]  capital all that energy it's all wasted it's all fake because the electronic voting machines
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:14:03.080]  rig every election it's just such a joke man oh by the way china is reopened for business
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:12.440]  they're having international soccer games in hundred thousand plus attended venues we're
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:20.760]  a joke man we're just a joke and uh if we let this child molesting creep joe biden in
[2:14:20.760 --> 2:14:24.600]  the white house we're done just forget about it we're done all right let's go back to the
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:32.000]  phone lines here don in illinois you're on the alex joneshow don go ahead hey uh oh and
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  great fan of you a long time uh info warrior first time caller thank you for calling it
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:46.840]  just wanted to mention that i live in the part of the resistance uh crook county where i'm
[2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:58.840]  paying probably 10.25% crook county taxes and now my blubbering um governor wants to
[2:14:58.840 --> 2:15:07.880]  probably raise my income taxes and the state sales taxes probably uh for the state sales
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:13.240]  tax probably another 10% yeah you're dealing with some corrupt democrats there in illinois
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:17.560]  not just pritzker what was it like two or it was like two or four years ago or something
[2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:21.960]  where they signed some law i don't know if they ever actually got it passed or couldn't force
[2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:26.760]  it legally but basically if you want to move out of illinois you basically have to pay property
[2:15:26.760 --> 2:15:35.000]  taxes like to move and then even after your move that's exactly right on and then not on top of that
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:45.240]  they um had this thing on the ballot this this year which was supposedly it was framed as a fair
[2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:53.320]  tax but what it was was the unfair tax because it was saying after a certain amount of money that you
[2:15:53.320 --> 2:16:00.440]  make they were going to charge you more which was thankfully thank god it was struck down
[2:16:00.440 --> 2:16:08.680]  but it would have actually um caused all anyone who was making massive amounts of money or not
[2:16:08.680 --> 2:16:15.000]  even massive anything above a certain amount probably around the 300 thousand range which
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:21.160]  isn't much uh in the state of illinois because of all the taxes to begin with but they would
[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:27.800]  basically leave the state so my question to the democrats is okay so all these billionaires or
[2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:33.400]  whatever especially pritzker pritzker is probably the only billionaire in the state to begin with
[2:16:33.960 --> 2:16:39.960]  and not only that but he tried to dodge his taxes by taking all the toilets out of his mansion
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:48.040]  to avoid taxes so now he's trying to push that on the middle class and if everyone
[2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:56.040]  who owns a business moves out of the state who's stuck with the tax it was basically a referendum
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:04.360]  on the tax code to release the the ceiling of what they could raise taxes well and this is what
[2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:10.920]  democrats are doing for multiple reasons not just to create a welfare state but to try to
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:15.560]  that's why they write these taxes in new york and illinois where if you move you have to keep
[2:17:15.560 --> 2:17:21.320]  paying property taxes in that state or pay like a moving tax on your property it's just totally
[2:17:21.320 --> 2:17:26.680]  illegal totally ridiculous that's how they can stop people from leaving so i mean it's all a scam
[2:17:27.720 --> 2:17:31.160]  you know i'm just wondering this is an idea that comes my head i'm sorry don i'm just i'm just
[2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:37.080]  thinking over here you know what i have a new proposal since this election is so fraught with
[2:17:37.960 --> 2:17:43.480]  discrepancies and anomalies and we just really can't decide on a winner you know what let's let's
[2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:53.640]  have this let's just declare whoever can occupy each state capital by the end of november
[2:17:54.520 --> 2:17:59.480]  wins let's just have it let's just let's just occupy state capitals and whoever gets to occupy
[2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:05.080]  the capitals wins it'll be 50 for trombone i'm not i'm not thoroughly convinced that
[2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:11.160]  illinois went to uh by well i'm not either because let me tell you something democrats in illinois
[2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:19.240]  are farmers and patriots and gun owners they're in my family i know them uh so they'll vote democrat
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:24.120]  but they're not going to vote against their second amendment they're not going to vote against uh the
[2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:29.400]  farming industry i mean you can i haven't i haven't analyzed the map but i guarantee him to you you
[2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:34.600]  pull up a map right now you'll have two districts near chicago that went blue you'll have east st
[2:18:34.600 --> 2:18:38.920]  louis that went blue you'll have springfield that probably went blue and then maybe urbana or
[2:18:38.920 --> 2:18:43.880]  bloomington but they're all run by democrats that could be complete fraud the whole state of illinois
[2:18:43.880 --> 2:18:50.120]  probably read except for those five districts before they even announced the election fraud
[2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:57.320]  they automatically gave 22 delegates to fight before even counting
[2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:07.560]  it's ridiculous it's the same story everywhere it's the same story in every state it's almost
[2:19:07.560 --> 2:19:14.040]  entirely red except for the democrat strongholds all right well i love you guys

[2:22:14.760 --> 2:22:21.560]  inoculations coming but most importantly a new lockdown that way he can say that trump is to
[2:22:21.560 --> 2:22:28.200]  blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID then of course when that new
[2:22:28.200 --> 2:22:32.920]  lockdown doesn't work those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:37.480]  and that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year this is a

[2:27:25.240 --> 2:27:32.120]  outlet out there that truly helps people every day people understand the complexity of everyday
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:38.680]  issues and how difficult it really is to try to save america and we are in trouble i am a i'm a
[2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:43.560]  property manager i've worked for multiple landlords in the houston area i'm a 30 year old conservative
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:48.040]  view i've got three kids doing the best that i can to keep my emotions in check because this call
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:55.320]  is 10 years in the making unfortunately this country is in big time jeopardy and it's coming from
[2:27:55.320 --> 2:28:01.400]  all aspects it's affecting people's relationships people's businesses my marriage is in jeopardy
[2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:07.480]  simply because of the fact that i won't agree that america is systematically racist my wife
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:14.120]  believes if you cannot agree that this country is a systematic racism problem that you are racist
[2:28:14.120 --> 2:28:21.240]  that it is ruining marriages it is ruining relationships i can speak to over 300 local
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:27.320]  businesses here in the houston area that have been killed or just think about general human to human
[2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:33.080]  interaction josh where now half the people are panicked if you're not wearing a mask i i go to
[2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:40.920]  pick up my dinner last night it's an outside pickup you can't even go in so ridiculous and so i'm
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:45.880]  standing outside sun was out as a nice afternoon standing outside waiting to pick up my dinner
[2:28:47.160 --> 2:28:51.080]  and some guy comes up he's got his mask on everybody wears their mask they love their mask
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:29:00.360]  some guy comes up has his mask on the guy uh the the the the worker gives me my food there's some um
[2:29:01.240 --> 2:29:05.640]  condiment packets or whatever that that fall off the ground and they kind of get launched when he
[2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:11.320]  hands me and they land right at the guy's feet who is standing there and so i just motion over to go
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:17.080]  pick it up he literally hops away like a jackrabbit like he's afraid because i'm not wearing a mask
[2:29:17.080 --> 2:29:24.120]  i mean it's twilight zone level hysteria and what's really the scary part of this country
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:30.040]  is that they are trying to take freedom free out of the word freedom and where in this country
[2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:37.960]  have we gone to where i cannot go to doctors like dr sherry tim penny dr colleen huber why am i not
[2:29:37.960 --> 2:29:45.080]  a why am i not allowed as an american citizen to to choose what doctor i want to listen to
[2:29:45.080 --> 2:29:49.400]  and as a as an american citizen you should be able to choose whatever doctor you should be
[2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:53.400]  able to listen to as an american citizen but see that's another thing liberalism has done
[2:29:53.400 --> 2:29:59.960]  i'll have a nanotech vaccine shoved into my arm and my kids arms and i'll tell you right now thank
[2:29:59.960 --> 2:30:05.080]  you guys thank you to david night thank you to harrison smith thank you to you oh and thank you
[2:30:05.080 --> 2:30:12.520]  to alex because what you're doing telling people about these vaccines and about covet 19 is critical
[2:30:12.520 --> 2:30:17.560]  and i'm telling you what you're doing is for people like well yeah and think about it too most
[2:30:17.560 --> 2:30:22.360]  mainstream news has literally just been turned into a giant ad for fizer or something just you
[2:30:22.360 --> 2:30:26.120]  know the big pharmaceuticals that that pay for them to be on air of course they want to push the
[2:30:26.120 --> 2:30:29.640]  vaccine we're we're not beholden to that but you know here's the other thing liberalism has done
[2:30:29.640 --> 2:30:36.600]  and again it's about peer-to-peer human interaction the average doctor or or you know a person that
[2:30:36.600 --> 2:30:41.080]  works in the service industry or whatever probably not a liberal probably not a brainwashed commie
[2:30:41.720 --> 2:30:49.480]  but but see just general activity and general interaction you're so afraid now that that person
[2:30:49.480 --> 2:30:55.400]  might be a liberal douche and so you censor your own speech or you know you wear the mask so now
[2:30:55.400 --> 2:31:02.360]  because of their bullying intimidation madness and intolerance we're all walking on eggshells
[2:31:02.360 --> 2:31:07.160]  walking on glass you know call it political correctness because because we don't know there
[2:31:07.160 --> 2:31:11.400]  might be some liberal douche bag that's going to call the police on us or tell us to wear a mask
[2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:15.480]  or you know tell us to get a vaccine so we're all changing our behavior and our approach and what
[2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:20.920]  we say and what we do because there might be some liberal douche lurking just getting ready to ruin
[2:31:20.920 --> 2:31:26.520]  your day all right hey josh i'm sorry i got a bounce president trump is giving a live press
[2:31:26.520 --> 2:31:31.000]  conference right now talking about the rigged drug prices we got to pick this up live first we've
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:36.040]  heard from the president in some time uh let's let's pick this up in the middle of this uh press
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:44.280]  conference hey i have to tell you it's a great honor for me to announce that my administration
[2:31:44.280 --> 2:31:49.880]  is issuing two groundbreaking rules to very dramatically lower the price of prescription
[2:31:49.880 --> 2:31:56.840]  drugs for the american people especially for our cherished seniors we're pleased to be joined
[2:31:57.560 --> 2:32:03.560]  on this occasion by secretary of health and human services alex aza that administrator of
[2:32:04.280 --> 2:32:09.800]  center for medicare medicaid services tima vermin thank you both thank you both and thank you all
[2:32:09.800 --> 2:32:16.440]  for being here appreciate it the unprecedented reforms we're completing today are the direct
[2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:23.560]  result of the historic drug pricing executive orders i signed in july uh statutorily we had to go
[2:32:23.560 --> 2:32:28.680]  through a very long process and we got it done i was very proud to have gotten this done we were
[2:32:28.680 --> 2:32:35.480]  pushing it very hard as we did with the vaccines and other things uh the first action will save
[2:32:35.480 --> 2:32:41.560]  american seniors billions of dollars by preventing middlemen the famous middlemen they call them
[2:32:42.440 --> 2:32:48.280]  from ripping off medicare patients with high prescription prices currently drug companies
[2:32:48.280 --> 2:32:53.880]  provide large discounts on the price of prescription medicines including nearly 40 billion dollars in
[2:32:53.880 --> 2:33:01.160]  rebates to medicare part d plans last year alone yet often middlemen stopped those discounts from
[2:33:01.160 --> 2:33:07.960]  going to the patients which is what we're interested in not the middlemen who need it the most so the
[2:33:07.960 --> 2:33:14.120]  patients are going to be now getting the benefit instead of these very wealthy individuals patients
[2:33:14.120 --> 2:33:20.280]  pay very high prices and they have for many years although we brought it down first time in 51 years
[2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:24.440]  with the course adding up all right so the president i mean you know you think about it
[2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:28.840]  he's bringing the troops home he's going after big pharma i mean he's doing everything that the
[2:33:28.840 --> 2:33:33.320]  left would love to have done ever he's doing everything any democrat president would have
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:37.080]  loved to put on their resume he's doing it and they still hate him for it because they're brainwashed
[2:33:37.080 --> 2:33:43.320]  by the media you know i i gotta say this is a little strange because
[2:33:45.800 --> 2:33:49.960]  folks i i i just call it as i see it as i feel it trump just doesn't feel like the president right
[2:33:49.960 --> 2:33:59.320]  now it's very it's a very odd thing and i know that he's been you know obviously strategically
[2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:04.120]  kind of been a disappearing act since the election but kind of feels weird for him to come out with
[2:34:04.120 --> 2:34:09.800]  this which for all intents and purposes is just a mundane trivial press conference talking about
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:13.560]  the rigged drug prices hey it's a great victory again donald trump fighting for the american people
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:16.600]  the guy's a hero he's a legend he's a great president of all time but he's not going to get
[2:34:16.600 --> 2:34:23.000]  any credit for it and in the middle of all of this this is what he comes out with to me this is a
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:31.880]  weak look but i'm not the president he's the art of the deal author but again if any other president
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:35.880]  was doing it if a democrat was doing this taking on big pharma they'd be saluted as a hero they'd
[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:39.960]  get ten Nobel peace prizes they'd be the time person of the year which will probably be Fauci
[2:34:39.960 --> 2:34:48.840]  that rat but um there you go cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be very
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:54.680]  stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member suffering from this
[2:34:54.680 --> 2:35:01.080]  degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:07.320]  studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:13.320]  decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:19.800]  in inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system recent studies have suggested
[2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:26.840]  that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[2:35:26.840 --> 2:35:33.480]  and activity of immune cells it worked for my family and now i can have a logical and calm
[2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:39.960]  discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality get your ultimate fish oil for a friend
[2:35:39.960 --> 2:35:46.040]  family member or yourself at info wars store dot com remember hillary clinton remember polosi
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:52.200]  remember bill clinton remember obama all of them said we are not gonna concede if there's a red
[2:35:52.200 --> 2:35:57.080]  mirage we believe it's gonna look like trumps gonna win landslides they had the internal polls
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:36:02.600]  and indeed trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin and he was set
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:09.960]  to win the other ones they froze the seven states on election night and then they brought in all of
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:13.960]  the reserve ballots they had this is completely transparent so when they say that he is president
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:18.600]  elect he's not trump is not conceded none of the states have certified the vote and now all these
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:24.280]  investigations have been opened up and avalanches mountains oceans of election fraud has come out
[2:36:24.280 --> 2:36:29.640]  and already been documented in georgia officials are on record saying we've already found fraud
[2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:34.840]  so ladies and gentlemen the fix is in they've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last
[2:36:34.840 --> 2:36:39.560]  hoax failed but now this is the mother of all hoaxes and if they get away with this it's the end
[2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:47.000]  of america as we know it we will be venezuela info wars dot com mid tech is in league with the
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  globalist and the chai cobs is attempting an information to against america and when we take

[2:38:20.040 --> 2:38:26.520]  poverty and poor ballooning populations and then watching all that new fruit down the vine to continually

[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:35.480]  they are the children of the devil and if you look at the slaves that serve them byton and kamala

[2:39:28.680 --> 2:39:34.440]  on the alex jones show go ahead i have years of experience with our broken government including
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:38.920]  the corrupt post office the post office under joe biden was ranked number one in whistleblower
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:44.200]  retaliation the post office has exposed millions of users info illegally exposed health records
[2:39:44.200 --> 2:39:49.160]  destroyed whistleblower evidence sold drugs sold veterans medications prostitution to hiding
[2:39:49.160 --> 2:39:53.800]  altering and destroying mail no one ever questions why mail all over the country is found hidden or
[2:39:53.800 --> 2:39:58.760]  the carrier in the news for defecating someone's yard the post office harasses its employees for
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:03.960]  not making their times postal harassment has led to suicide in the term going postal i have a union
[2:40:03.960 --> 2:40:08.600]  fly out of states carriers are treated like the inside of a toilet the post office places itself
[2:40:08.600 --> 2:40:13.320]  and is as corrupt as all other federal agencies manager runs the post office into the ground and
[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:17.800]  the post office cries they are broke as they hand out bonuses a agency that was billions of dollars
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:22.040]  for breaking federal law should not be trusted with mail-in ballots every city in america should
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:26.840]  be calling for protests at their local post office for rigging the election info wars needs to set a
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:35.720]  date set a date for a national protest because a lot of people can't make it to atlanta but they
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:42.360]  have a local post office that's five minutes from their house yeah that's a difficult one i mean
[2:40:42.360 --> 2:40:47.080]  you're not going to convince many people that the post office is their biggest problem quite frankly
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:55.960]  myself included but uh when president trumpus is next uh rally he needs to have a big prompter up
[2:40:55.960 --> 2:41:00.600]  there with biden meeting the voter fraud i've seen the video everybody seen the video no it's a total
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:05.000]  joke they've been caught right handed but again the problem is they're not going to be able to prove
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:10.040]  it the only case that sinney powell is going to be able to make ladies and gentlemen is the sworn
[2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:15.400]  affidavits will the court hear them will they be put on the witness stand will the nation get

[2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:19.720]  in the christ of his mouth and his tongue will destroy satan and we are in the body of christ
[2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:26.760]  man so everything that we are doing is destroying satan and he's it been out here and these people
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:34.120]  know it not only these people know it as far as the our foreign enemy and globalists but satan
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:39.640]  himself know that hell is being ripped it out man this is powerful things that you guys got

[2:42:52.440 --> 2:43:00.280]  can't afford to take it right now and we're so committed to this but you know i feel that you
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:07.800]  know we're all here we've all been training for this we've all felt that this moment was coming so
[2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:13.320]  there's a reason we've been prepared for this psychologically emotionally intellectually
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:18.440]  there's a reason why we always knew this moment was coming there's a reason why we're here
[2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:27.080]  here you know so it is god's providence no doubt i don't you know sometimes i get solace in that
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:32.600]  usually not on air but there's no doubt there's a reason why this is all culminating right now
[2:43:35.400 --> 2:43:41.160]  i do with you sir and the main thing to keep the balance of the thoughts you got to always
[2:43:41.160 --> 2:43:48.440]  remember that the eye is the backbone and that's where Alice is he's in the out of backbone in Georgia

[2:44:09.400 --> 2:44:15.880]  yeah say alex uh and i was i mean oh and uh i just wanted to mention a couple things first
[2:44:15.880 --> 2:44:23.080]  off i just uh i took delivery of 135 dollars of info works uh essentials and everything yesterday
[2:44:24.040 --> 2:44:30.840]  and this time the post office didn't smash my back no that's the truth man i've had i've had more
[2:44:30.840 --> 2:44:36.200]  man people are coming after the post office today well that guy had a good idea about going to the
[2:44:36.200 --> 2:44:43.720]  post office at any rate uh listen concerning the truckers i was there in 1982 and we had the
[2:44:43.720 --> 2:44:54.040]  trucker strike and it didn't go well because nobody would stay organized the way to do a trucker
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:45:02.200]  strike first off without hurting us the people is get the law on your side in other words follow
[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:10.520]  that book to the t slow down run 55 miles an hour everyone stop and have little rallies
[2:45:10.520 --> 2:45:17.160]  during the break of the truck stop and just slow it down we know here's here's what i'm definitely
[2:45:17.160 --> 2:45:22.120]  finding out with with the stop the steel rallies and the caravan and everything i'm talking about
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:27.480]  uh as far as stopping this election theft there are more people who are willing to put everything
[2:45:27.480 --> 2:45:33.960]  down and do whatever it takes to stop this deal because they realize this is it whether it's
[2:45:33.960 --> 2:45:39.160]  their day job their career their hourly job you know whatever you know oh my dog whatever it is
[2:45:39.160 --> 2:45:44.520]  people are dropping everything to do anything they can do looking for something to do any
[2:45:44.520 --> 2:45:48.280]  way for their voice to be heard to try to stop this deal that's why you had the million magamarch
[2:45:48.280 --> 2:45:51.640]  that's why there's going to be a second one on december 12th that's why the truckers are organizing
[2:45:51.640 --> 2:45:56.440]  strikes that's why at every nation's capital people are rallying and organizing so america is beginning
[2:45:56.440 --> 2:46:07.160]  to rise up and roar uh on please um i was trying for the last since august to place an order and
[2:46:07.160 --> 2:46:14.440]  they kept on squelching my card i've been on file with you guys for 10 years and they kept on uh
[2:46:14.440 --> 2:46:19.720]  wouldn't allow me to get into my credit card dude to place the order and finally i had to call in
[2:46:19.720 --> 2:46:25.480]  which i did but i gotta tell you man the suppression and the censorship is the biggest fall that uh
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:32.520]  our president dropped well you can debate what the biggest ball was dropped or the biggest
[2:46:32.520 --> 2:46:37.720]  mis-move was but uh you know the time for it's time now for president trump to have
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:42.280]  clear vision and strike true against the deep state in the new world order otherwise i'm not
[2:46:42.280 --> 2:46:45.400]  sure he's gonna get a second chance i'm not sure if we're gonna get a second chance tom thank you
[2:46:45.400 --> 2:46:50.840]  so much for the call david uh actually i'm sorry you know what jed in florida jed has been holding
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:57.560]  longest year jed go ahead what's going on and how are you man doing good good hey i thought uh a
[2:46:57.560 --> 2:47:02.600]  little sharing a story here's my mom she's kind of old school and this is to the uh you know the
[2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:08.120]  radio broadcast he uh called into the schnitz show because he was saying there was no proof of voter
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:14.360]  fraud with dominion software and that was a cute thing and who's so conspiracy theory the schnitz
[2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:21.160]  show i think he comes on like okay that's just a local talk show there in florida um i think it's
[2:47:21.160 --> 2:47:26.360]  nationwide okay i'm not sure i listened to you guys i've been putting her on y'all and uh but
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:31.480]  anyway he was you know giving her a bunch of pushback and kind of trash and oan and news max
[2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:37.720]  and saying that they're uh perfectly non-credible so i just want to get your thoughts on on that claim
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:44.600]  well i i'm just unfamiliar with the the show or the claim but i would just say
[2:47:45.720 --> 2:47:52.040]  um you know most people that have made it and are successful and in this medium of media
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:58.040]  have been bought and paid for in some way shape or form and have sold out in some way shape or
[2:47:58.040 --> 2:48:02.680]  form so yes and i've been saying this at all the rallies and speeches i've been doing in this in
[2:48:02.680 --> 2:48:08.120]  this level of this battle for the republic expect to be abandoned expect to be stabbed in the back
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  and so yeah you're gonna have weak need cowardly people on the radio and on tv who do not understand
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:20.120]  the magnitude of this and the real consequences who are just going along to get along hoping not
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:24.120]  to ruffle any feathers so that they can survive on air another four years or what have you uh so
[2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:29.960]  that's how i'd measure that jed is there any avenue here too because i heard you earlier
[2:48:29.960 --> 2:48:35.320]  saying cindy powell's only case really is with these after david but are they not able to to
[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:40.040]  prove that there was an algorithm that these these softwares are you know maybe they can maybe they
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:46.920]  can't but see we have to deal with reality and we have to deal with the the likely odds of what's
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:57.160]  going to you know be the winning strategy here um yeah that guy looks like i'm not um but they
[2:48:57.160 --> 2:49:05.320]  just found that show you were talking about um you just look at all the crimes they've gotten away
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:13.800]  with and so hey it's just so hard i mean look at all i mean look at this spy gate fake russian
[2:49:13.800 --> 2:49:19.960]  collusion the fake pp dossier this i mean all they've gotten away with so much i mean they've
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:25.320]  been caught red handed doing so much she's like i mean so how do you defeat this system
[2:49:25.320 --> 2:49:30.840]  that is so big so corrupt so widespread owns everything how do you beat it what is the skeleton
[2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:38.680]  key what it we don't want wow most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:43.960]  directed by the tony's chinese and the united nations and now because the slaves have proven
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:49.240]  themselves to be subservient the worst australian models of complete lockdowns so you can't even
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:54.520]  leave your house for months and months are being announced and in germany the police are using
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:59.880]  giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men women and children that protest the fact that
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:05.320]  merkel the dictator has put them under her control that's right she's been rigging elections for years
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:10.440]  and years and the same thing is coming here to the united states this is world government
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:15.400]  in philadelphia they've announced four people are more seen together will be arrested they're
[2:50:15.400 --> 2:50:20.840]  announcing the christmas is canceled this is what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you
[2:50:20.840 --> 2:50:27.800]  to take rid of all your due process and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet how long
[2:50:27.800 --> 2:50:33.400]  have we warned you about this but you can fight back america is the last bastion stop submitting
[2:50:35.960 --> 2:50:42.680]  the problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites the most cunning smart inventive people
[2:50:43.880 --> 2:50:48.360]  believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore they don't believe in being aristocrats
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:53.160]  it's trying to hold up civilization and power the people and once the establishment has that
[2:50:53.160 --> 2:50:57.880]  predatory idea civilization collapses very very quickly you can't treat the least of us
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:03.400]  like garbage and not treat your own family like that and so it is this lack of empathy that's
[2:51:03.400 --> 2:51:09.000]  going to destroy us the globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that commit rituals
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:14.200]  of all sorts of horrible crimes try to get away from humanity but really they can't escape the
[2:51:14.200 --> 2:51:19.880]  laws of the universe they may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves but
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:24.360]  the repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and
[2:51:24.360 --> 2:51:29.640]  the very structure itself wealth is created by loving god wealth is created by having connection
[2:51:29.640 --> 2:51:35.240]  to god god is the source of all creation all success all power we deny that you'll be destroyed
[2:51:35.240 --> 2:51:44.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:51:49.320 --> 2:51:56.200]  want to hear a real uh mind twister cesspool of media corruption headline la times buzz
[2:51:56.200 --> 2:52:04.680]  feed to buy huff post from verizon okay uh let's go to the phone calls here i'm going to try to
[2:52:04.680 --> 2:52:08.920]  squeeze in as many as i can in the short four and a half minutes david in oklahoma david you're
[2:52:08.920 --> 2:52:17.960]  on the alex jones show go ahead oh and praise god uh let me say i just missed you in tulsa uh my uh
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:24.040]  my plug is going to be vezzo x2 and ultra 12 uh that's that intestinal fortitude that's good
[2:52:24.040 --> 2:52:29.800]  stuff uh really taking care of me on there i mean the reason i called was this east and west coast
[2:52:29.800 --> 2:52:36.520]  agenda you know that's a facet uh of the nwo and you know the disparity that's uh being caused
[2:52:36.520 --> 2:52:41.720]  politically is going to end up in this this material loss and i don't think it's a good idea to even
[2:52:41.720 --> 2:52:47.560]  entertain conversation about uh succeeding uh infrastructure and lands especially on our coast
[2:52:48.120 --> 2:52:54.520]  it's just another weakening aspect of this war no i agree that's why when the caller brought it
[2:52:54.520 --> 2:52:59.320]  up earlier i said it's kind of pipe dreamish and unrealistic i mean you could fathom it you could
[2:52:59.320 --> 2:53:03.160]  talk about it you could propose it but is it really uh legitimate is it really something
[2:53:03.160 --> 2:53:08.920]  that could ever happen probably not we got to stand we've got to enforce our laws we've got to
[2:53:08.920 --> 2:53:13.160]  we've got to enforce our principled laws we've got to go after the people that don't
[2:53:15.960 --> 2:53:16.680]  about that
[2:53:18.760 --> 2:53:25.080]  well uh man i'd just like to say uh you know we need to uh further consider uh you know
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:31.480]  the long term here uh there's there's pretty much the social contract's broken the civil contract's
[2:53:31.480 --> 2:53:37.560]  broken uh the zero you know the the violations in our elections have already occurred the
[2:53:38.440 --> 2:53:43.240]  there's a there's basically zero confidence in government at this point i mean let's just call

[2:58:47.880 --> 2:58:54.760]  alaska branch of the info wars but i want to say this about that is i listen i try to integrate
[2:58:54.760 --> 2:59:00.680]  then what i learned from people who do correspond and call into the other shows so that we cover
[2:59:00.680 --> 2:59:07.560]  these points and one of them i heard was the sonic weapon announced in the press i saw that
[2:59:07.560 --> 2:59:15.080]  clip and it was chinese utilizing a um microwave based weapon on the indian border in a conflict
[2:59:15.080 --> 2:59:20.360]  with india and i did look into that a while ago and this is what i know about that first of all
[2:59:20.360 --> 2:59:26.920]  millimeter waves microwave technology used for this purpose uh no question about it but
[2:59:26.920 --> 2:59:31.880]  how do they use it and what does it do it'll create for instance a heating sensation on the
[2:59:31.880 --> 2:59:40.280]  skin you can create this so it feels like about a 135 140 degrees i mean where it's really really
[2:59:40.280 --> 2:59:47.400]  painful um and it's again for pushing you back or driving uh people away and because the border
[2:59:47.400 --> 2:59:55.000]  agreement dealt with just one aspect it dealt with the aspect of not shooting normal conventional
[2:59:55.000 --> 2:59:59.800]  weapons you know bullets and bombs that's why e.m electromagnetic weapons were developed
[3:00:00.680 --> 3:00:07.000]  over 25 30 years ago and have been continued in terms of the development and strategy over
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:12.040]  the years and there's a photo up for those that have the video feed and you also see the us version
[3:00:12.040 --> 3:00:18.280]  of the same device now these devices were well spoken about the secretary of defense came out
[3:00:18.280 --> 3:00:23.640]  spoke about them mainly for crowd control riot control purposes in dual use you'll see these on
[3:00:23.640 --> 3:00:28.680]  our streets of america because they're a good way to control crowds without killing anyone without
[3:00:28.680 --> 3:00:36.040]  the same visual images that you get when smoke tear gas and clubs and all that come out so they'll
[3:00:36.040 --> 3:00:42.440]  use what are called non-lethal technologies technologies that don't necessarily kill you the
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:00:47.000]  problem is with these microwave weapons they can interfere with certain electronic devices you
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:52.280]  know like hard-paced makers other appliances you might have in your body they keep everything rolling
[3:00:52.280 --> 3:00:56.840]  so you might want to think about this as they're deployed around the world and around the country
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:01:02.440]  because i reported on this in the 1980s uh was when the first conversations were coming in in the
[3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:07.720]  early 90s we began to break the story because what the department of defense and department of
[3:01:07.720 --> 3:01:14.520]  justice were talking about is priority funding for dual use this is how far back all of this goes
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:20.680]  the dual use theory was that we could take these types of weapons and i testified in the european
[3:01:20.680 --> 3:01:26.760]  parliament i testified in major international groups about slowing this down because of the
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:32.040]  invasiveness of the technologies coupled with the invasiveness of the surveillance technologies
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:36.920]  so these things are real they're just being talked about more in the mainstream now now what happened
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:42.600]  as a result of that testimony that i gave is the most important security and disarmament
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:49.080]  recommendations coming out of the european parliament by consensus by the biggest consensus
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:54.760]  were our sections in that which dealt with park which i'm not talking about today non-lethal
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:02:01.320]  weapons which were right on point here okay so when they passed that this section on non-lethal
[3:02:01.320 --> 3:02:06.920]  weapons things that would kill you without making holes in you uh in the same conventional way this
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:14.760]  this was so we presented so much evidence three feet of unclassified documents to prove our point
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:20.200]  scientific literature the studies everything this is going back two decades more than two
[3:02:20.200 --> 3:02:27.560]  decades okay this is how old all this news is that the mainstream's finally figuring out and leaking in
[3:02:27.560 --> 3:02:35.480]  give me a break the point of info wars has always been we're the tip of the spear we've been in this
[3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:42.120]  longest i've been volunteering time as a voice on info wars since alex started because he started
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:48.120]  just about a year year and a half after i did in this work and he built this network and a couple
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:53.720]  of years ago three years ago when things were really horrible you know for alex going on a lot of
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:03:00.840]  stuff and he needed help and i flew down to austin and actually spent a week there and met alex
[3:03:00.840 --> 3:03:05.720]  face to face for the first time after all those years of working together just the nature of our
[3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:13.800]  lives but this was time for an intermission and and lift up my brother down there in austin and
[3:03:13.800 --> 3:03:18.200]  i'm asking every one of you listening right now to do this in lots of different ways that you
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:23.320]  can't i know a lot of people economically can't help in that way so don't pray you can do that
[3:03:23.320 --> 3:03:29.800]  it's free doesn't cost you anything and everybody here i know i know and i've been there i've seen
[3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:35.320]  it i've been a couple of different times for a week each time and you are supporting an incredible
[3:03:35.880 --> 3:03:43.800]  team and those guys need a payroll keep going i i'm i'm blessed so i can volunteer my time here
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:47.400]  and i that's what i do when you hear me on radio around the world that's what i'm doing i'm
[3:03:47.400 --> 3:03:54.040]  volunteering my time because this is my info war and i get to work with up 200 producers worldwide
[3:03:54.040 --> 3:04:00.120]  in television and radio and have been for 25 years because this message the message that we're all
[3:04:00.120 --> 3:04:07.640]  talking about today needs to be everywhere it needs to be through every venue reaching every
[3:04:07.640 --> 3:04:15.080]  constituency from the far left to the far right and everybody in between because we have a message
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:22.120]  a message of liberty of sovereignty of freedom and what free speech gives us in the opportunity
[3:04:22.120 --> 3:04:28.920]  to engage one another because the fundamental aspect of every issue that we talk about boils
[3:04:28.920 --> 3:04:36.680]  down to one thing being able to be the voice to be able to speak freely to be able to take what
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:42.520]  we are as created human beings in the image and likeness of god and press it through our voices
[3:04:42.520 --> 3:04:48.520]  and be heard and people can discern what we say and separate what we say and choose on their own
[3:04:48.520 --> 3:04:55.640]  because that's their right that is their birthright too but the info war is not about shutting the
[3:04:55.640 --> 3:05:03.240]  opposition down it's about a better idea a better set of values a better base set of concepts that
[3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:09.080]  people can believe in because here's what every human being does unless they've so shut it all
[3:05:09.080 --> 3:05:15.320]  shut it all down they no longer have to be called consciousness connected to them in the same way
[3:05:15.320 --> 3:05:21.160]  they've closed the voice down that's heard all the time as we direct our traffic through the brain
[3:05:22.680 --> 3:05:30.760]  and they don't listen there's not very many of them the rest truth rings in the soul of every
[3:05:30.760 --> 3:05:37.240]  living soul every soul seeking to awaken to who they are and what they are and what we are and
[3:05:37.240 --> 3:05:45.080]  what we can do and how we can do it and all these threats against us generate fear anxiety and the
[3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:52.360]  very things that shut down the power that we are the love that flows through us now i want to jump
[3:05:52.360 --> 3:05:57.960]  into another issue that got touched on the chinese you know concepts of what's going on and how does
[3:05:57.960 --> 3:06:02.760]  this roll out and what does this really mean because now they're introducing these non-lethal
[3:06:02.760 --> 3:06:09.560]  weapons to the battlefield in a way that circumvents current treaties and laws and regulations this is
[3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:18.120]  the point i've been making for 25 years it's not just the chinese to chai comms it's all of their
[3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:24.440]  collaborators in the west for a little bit of money has traded off technology to the point
[3:06:24.440 --> 3:06:31.720]  where we don't we don't have the control and command that we used to have they do too and
[3:06:31.720 --> 3:06:37.960]  they have a lot more people and they produce their technology for fraction of the money that we do
[3:06:37.960 --> 3:06:43.240]  historically of course ai is going to change that and flatten that playing field out because labor
[3:06:43.240 --> 3:06:48.040]  won't be the big factor and we should be concerned about that because that is the direction of the
[3:06:48.040 --> 3:06:55.400]  21st century and how we shape that how do we do that how do we transfer all the things that you and
[3:06:55.400 --> 3:07:03.720]  i do from flipping burgers to driving trucks right underground miners all of it it's all going ai
[3:07:03.720 --> 3:07:09.800]  robotics because it's cheaper they don't file workers comp claims and they don't have 401ks
[3:07:11.160 --> 3:07:19.720]  we are all expendable in the 21st century if we allow a globalist takeover of everything it's not
[3:07:19.720 --> 3:07:25.880]  just our flesh at stake it's our living souls and how we are playing it out in the planet today
[3:07:25.880 --> 3:07:30.200]  this is dr. nick baggots you're listening to the info wars and we'll be right back after these messages

[3:10:01.320 --> 3:10:06.840]  the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation not the covid virus that is a fact
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:12.520]  and all the hero's sheep where the mass can go along with this are signing on to mass murder
[3:10:12.520 --> 3:10:17.560]  bigger than what hitler did that's when we got the geneva convention and the nuremberg code

[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:18.200]  and welcome back you know i i always forget to run my uh my own commercial and the guys always
[3:12:18.200 --> 3:12:23.160]  put up the image and i space it out it's earth pulse dot com check out my website there's lots of
[3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:29.000]  things there there's also a link to all the previous programs i've done um on info wars takes
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:33.720]  you right into band dot video and then they're all chronological so if you click on that button
[3:12:33.720 --> 3:12:38.600]  it's under special events right in the middle of the screen at earth pulse dot com and you can look
[3:12:38.600 --> 3:12:43.960]  at it um what i've done and subjects that we've covered and there's a lot of material there uh
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:49.080]  jumping into what what we're what what i left off with was the issue of pre-speech and why it's so
[3:12:49.080 --> 3:12:54.120]  important right now of all the issues it is the issue because nothing else can happen unless we
[3:12:54.120 --> 3:12:59.800]  can still have a conversation and i've even read uh reports now people calling for the banning of
[3:12:59.800 --> 3:13:06.600]  talk radio all the all all together to keep our voices from being heard this is insanity in this
[3:13:06.600 --> 3:13:15.800]  republic that is total craziness in the modern world you know and anyone that's trying to sell
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:22.040]  you this is also interested in selling you something that just doesn't exist this is
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:28.840]  this is a sales pitch for the wrong game plan ladies and gentlemen our speech is fundamental
[3:13:28.840 --> 3:13:33.720]  to who we are and the idea of offending people with words remember when we were little kids maybe
[3:13:33.720 --> 3:13:40.040]  they don't even say this anymore sticks and stones will break my bones but words would never hurt me
[3:13:40.040 --> 3:13:49.960]  get real folks i mean are we that much of a weak uh wimp society i don't think so i know i know that
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:57.000]  i know that i know that anyone who believes that we should lay down and just take it
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:05.480]  and shut up and behave no that is not who we are be polite be respectful but i wouldn't
[3:14:05.480 --> 3:14:11.720]  say behave in the sense of conforming i'd say do the opposite be a respectful non-conformist
[3:14:11.720 --> 3:14:19.160]  and you know when when i drop uh kids off at school i say hey you're going to the propaganda palace
[3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:24.360]  today make sure you ask respectful questions when you don't believe what you're being told
[3:14:24.360 --> 3:14:31.720]  because even children know in their heart when the message isn't ringing true and they need
[3:14:31.720 --> 3:14:38.200]  to have confidence in that voice and not start shutting it down at seven and eight and nine
[3:14:38.200 --> 3:14:46.280]  because here's what happens when they do then it shuts down permanently let me say that again
[3:14:46.280 --> 3:14:51.960]  if you quit listening to what some call the little voice in the head you know your consciousness
[3:14:51.960 --> 3:14:58.200]  maybe god talking to you if you quit listening eventually you stop hearing because the voice
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:04.200]  isn't there anymore you filter it out like background noise in the crowded room don't do that
[3:15:05.720 --> 3:15:13.240]  don't do that stay firm on your truth if you're going to shake it change it whether it's something
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:20.520]  i say or any of us say check it out don't change your trajectory on your path through life because
[3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:27.080]  i say something unless you can confirm it's true that's it two witnesses don't make the change
[3:15:27.080 --> 3:15:31.560]  confirm it's true find the evidence now that's what i want to get to because in the context of
[3:15:31.560 --> 3:15:37.240]  delivering free speech you got to dig out information and that's getting harder and harder and i know
[3:15:38.040 --> 3:15:44.040]  guys i talk to all the time because the cartoonish nature of the mainstream gets getting more and
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:50.280]  more ridiculous on the last time i could fly an initial international flight i went to the back you
[3:15:50.280 --> 3:15:56.680]  know to use a bathroom because i still fly economy and when i was walking back i see all these screens
[3:15:56.680 --> 3:16:01.880]  up you know and people watching their tv and you know most of them are watching cartoons for god's
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:11.480]  sake adults this is the programming we're dumping in is the cartoons i guess so which means bad news
[3:16:11.480 --> 3:16:15.640]  and good news here's the good news most people are watching cartoons that makes the few of us that
[3:16:15.640 --> 3:16:19.960]  aren't a lot more effective in what we do and that includes every one of you because you're paying
[3:16:19.960 --> 3:16:26.840]  attention you're getting information dig it out confirm it also no matter who's delivering it confirm
[3:16:26.840 --> 3:16:32.680]  it even if it's a trusted source because if it's about your life take control of your life and
[3:16:32.680 --> 3:16:37.720]  quit getting pushed around by anybody because this is the problem with the globalist they think they
[3:16:37.720 --> 3:16:44.040]  just keep pushing and pushing and just nudging and nudging and we just fallen into this tighter and
[3:16:44.040 --> 3:16:49.880]  tighter bubble until they just squeeze a living soul out of us and that's the objective and we
[3:16:49.880 --> 3:16:54.920]  can't let it happen now let me talk i'm going to shift gears a bit and i want to get into something
[3:16:54.920 --> 3:17:00.280]  that got mentioned again the chinese you know chinese have a problem now in china it's called
[3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:08.520]  chinese isis they got an islamic state rising in china now the first time i heard about this was
[3:17:08.520 --> 3:17:15.160]  an lecture at the alaska pacific university here in alaska obviously in anchorage and it was i think
[3:17:15.160 --> 3:17:20.120]  it was methodist then methodist university but anyway it was a speaker he'd been a priest a
[3:17:20.120 --> 3:17:26.120]  catholic priest in china and russia in the areas where the russian republics the southern republics
[3:17:26.120 --> 3:17:33.400]  but not against china the all amending and stan you know vijica stan kazakhstan etc well all these
[3:17:33.400 --> 3:17:39.800]  places when they moved away and russia let them go right why did they do that why did they do that
[3:17:39.800 --> 3:17:44.840]  because they were the biggest growing population this with this catholic priest was lecturing about
[3:17:44.840 --> 3:17:52.200]  19 it was 78 or 79 when i caught that lecture so this is a long time ago again and i was in my
[3:17:52.200 --> 3:17:58.280]  early 20s listening to this lecture and what he said was the biggest threat to china and russia
[3:17:58.280 --> 3:18:05.240]  was islam because they weren't adhering to the chinese rule of one kid and in russia they were
[3:18:05.240 --> 3:18:12.840]  the biggest growing population there and they were outnumbering in russia or former ussr the
[3:18:12.840 --> 3:18:20.840]  white europeans and russians um care about this okay they're where we were in the 1950s in terms of
[3:18:20.840 --> 3:18:26.840]  how they view other cultures and i'm not judging them i'm just saying i've been there i've seen
[3:18:26.840 --> 3:18:33.560]  that i've i understand a little bit about a russian culture just a little bit and i will not judge
[3:18:33.560 --> 3:18:39.560]  another culture because i'm not in it and i can't make those judgments so that's that's for people
[3:18:39.560 --> 3:18:43.240]  within a culture to make that's why we have sovereign nations that's why we have structures
[3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:48.440]  that we have because that's reality that we all know on the ground when we travel around the world
[3:18:48.440 --> 3:18:54.200]  when we travel around the world but also having said that the soul of man no matter where you go
[3:18:54.920 --> 3:19:01.400]  it's all in there it's all in there and it's about waking everyone up and everyone is doing
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:07.720]  their part and there are people waking up in china and russia and everywhere and there have been
[3:19:07.720 --> 3:19:12.920]  and i think some of the greatest things may come out of these places that had experience in our
[3:19:12.920 --> 3:19:18.040]  lifetime some of the greatest repressions uh you know what russia came out of and yeah they're still
[3:19:18.040 --> 3:19:25.160]  evolving into a more mature democracy and they got a ways to go china they got a revolution yet to
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:30.680]  have you know and hopefully they do someday the kind of revolution that liberates individual
[3:19:30.680 --> 3:19:36.680]  souls and to outside of a collective squishy empire because that's what that's what is now the
[3:19:36.680 --> 3:19:45.400]  chinese have been cracking down on on islamic people you know this is wrong the way they've
[3:19:45.400 --> 3:19:50.760]  done this they've herded them all into camps for reeducation to get them to renounce their beliefs
[3:19:50.760 --> 3:19:57.160]  from religion now whether you and i believe it or not what i do believe in is this i believe in
[3:19:57.160 --> 3:20:02.120]  religious freedom one of the foundations of this nation that people should be free to worship if
[3:20:02.120 --> 3:20:09.880]  they wish whether you're jewish or is islam or christian or mazlum or hindu i don't care you have
[3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:17.000]  the freedom to do that as an individual but they are rounding people up and putting them in camps
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:24.120]  because of what they believe and and this is speech at the fundamental core and where are the voices
[3:20:24.120 --> 3:20:29.960]  of the liberal left in this country as millions have been herded into camps and we're just worried
[3:20:29.960 --> 3:20:40.440]  about how much business we can do this is nick baggins you're in the info words will be right
[3:20:40.680 --> 3:20:45.560]  commies china has been fully open for business for more than six months but the european union
[3:20:45.560 --> 3:20:50.440]  and every other major western nation is still under some form of lockdown and the lockdowns are
[3:20:50.440 --> 3:20:54.440]  getting more intense and people are being told they're going to be arrested and they leave their
[3:20:54.440 --> 3:21:01.240]  houses just like we've seen in australia you see the authoritarians want total control and because
[3:21:01.240 --> 3:21:06.200]  they don't respect this because the general public puts up with so much abuse they're going for broke
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:11.080]  why shouldn't they they never get in trouble for the big illegal wars never get in trouble
[3:21:11.080 --> 3:21:15.880]  for the chinese slave camps never get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation in africa
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:21.320]  they never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs into our country and so why
[3:21:21.320 --> 3:21:26.280]  shouldn't they go for broke because so many people are domesticated and they're soft and they have
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:31.640]  scott com syndrome they love their abusers they can't believe they're being lied to they can't
[3:21:31.640 --> 3:21:36.680]  believe they're being conned and so they're going into bondage you see there's always a minority
[3:21:36.680 --> 3:21:43.800]  that says no an info wars is that minority big tech is in league with the globalist and the chai
[3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:50.840]  cops is attempting an information to against america and when we take this country back they must be
[3:21:50.840 --> 3:21:59.080]  held accountable the games are over the waiting is over the fight is now out in the open world
[3:21:59.080 --> 3:22:04.600]  government is here in the latter part of 2020 is attempting to collapse the world economy set up

[3:24:12.760 --> 3:24:17.640]  and welcome back you know what talking about just before the break we're talking a little bit about
[3:24:18.200 --> 3:24:24.520]  kind of russia kind of what's happening there in the rise of islam in terms of china right now
[3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:31.640]  they got a problem you know russia by the changes in their boundaries and how they how they broke up
[3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:37.720]  you know they they don't have the same the same issues they've kept the bulk of the wealth of
[3:24:37.720 --> 3:24:45.320]  the nation if you will of the old soviet republics in russia and and also the republics that were
[3:24:45.320 --> 3:24:51.000]  spun off and allowed measure of their liberty under the sphere of influence that the russians
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:56.280]  have in their in their area that's same as us in our area you know that's kind of how it's been
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:03.800]  but they have resources to tremendous oil gas natural resources of all kinds and and then you've
[3:25:03.800 --> 3:25:09.000]  got china that needs a lot of resources and has a lot of resources developing there's also
[3:25:10.600 --> 3:25:16.600]  and then they and then you have the technology and this is interesting because it as as that last
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:21.880]  hour you know talking about when they got into just that little bit about the weapons and the
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:27.480]  sonic weapons and the microwave weapons it made me think about china generally and how they look
[3:25:27.480 --> 3:25:34.440]  at things and if you go back and i've read three feet four feet of literature on china going back
[3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:38.520]  three thousand years to some of their ancient philosophy and read it all the way into the
[3:25:38.520 --> 3:25:42.760]  current frame because i really want to know how people think the best i can i mean i can't be
[3:25:42.760 --> 3:25:46.760]  i can't be a hundred percent there but i can get maybe seventy percent i think that's the best anyone
[3:25:46.760 --> 3:25:51.960]  can do when you're trying to interpret anyone else from because you only do it through your own
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:57.160]  filter that's that's just the way it is but as i look at what's happened the knowledge of energy
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:26:02.920]  is a basic science think about qigong and what that is think about acupuncture and what that is
[3:26:02.920 --> 3:26:08.760]  now acupuncture i know a good deal about in fact it's a measure of skin resistance in other words
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:13.400]  energetic differentials that can be discerned on the surface of skin that doesn't line up with the
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:17.880]  nervous system or the muscular system or the circulatory system it's a separate system it's
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:22.760]  an energetic system and i have little devices that you can put across the surface of the skin and
[3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:27.240]  in lectures i demonstrate them and in every place there's an acupuncture point you'll get a signal
[3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:32.040]  you'll get a little lightness and an auditory signal that'll tell you hey you're on the mark
[3:26:32.040 --> 3:26:38.680]  because there's an energetic signal now manipulating those energetic fields is what em weapons
[3:26:38.680 --> 3:26:44.840]  are about it's what the new technology is all about the idea of taking energy itself
[3:26:45.480 --> 3:26:51.240]  and shaping forming and pulsing it in certain ways that couple with the human body that then
[3:26:51.240 --> 3:26:59.240]  allow you to sort of grab a bit of control now this is getting more refined or as what i call
[3:26:59.240 --> 3:27:06.520]  in technology higher and higher res resolution as our speed of computing and density of computing
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:12.200]  continues to rise and so if you look at a lot of the work i've done in this area you can look at
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:17.080]  one of the books in particular controlling the human mind now it's a little bit dated now but
[3:27:17.080 --> 3:27:24.120]  all of it is is fresh as you need to get the issues understood because what's happened since
[3:27:24.120 --> 3:27:30.600]  that publication is we've gone a lot further and so the resolution's gotten better and in back in
[3:27:30.600 --> 3:27:36.680]  in uh 10 15 years ago what you could do is manipulate emotions quite easily you can do that today
[3:27:36.680 --> 3:27:43.640]  but the idea of manipulating specific ideas thoughts how to program literally masses
[3:27:44.200 --> 3:27:49.080]  and individuals or how to extract information and know what people are thinking and then how to
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:55.400]  send messages back in you know these are the things that are are are here now and coming
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:28:01.560]  now there was a publication technology uh horizons it was an air force publication
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:08.520]  and and i've got a clipping back in june 2002 it cited in in controlling the human mind and why
[3:28:08.520 --> 3:28:17.160]  it's important is where the government was going then when this was written was to create systems
[3:28:17.160 --> 3:28:25.000]  that would replicate all of the senses touch taste smell sight sound in such a way to create
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:32.040]  complete memory sets that would be indistinguishable let me say that again complete memories that would
[3:28:32.040 --> 3:28:39.080]  be indistinguishable from a real experience no what does that do to testimony in courts
[3:28:39.800 --> 3:28:44.440]  what does that do to learning systems if you can push information in and just
[3:28:44.440 --> 3:28:50.760]  sort of shove it into your long-term memory that's where this is going so then who controls
[3:28:50.760 --> 3:28:54.920]  curriculum right now you go oh i can screen it out i'm the parent i can look through the
[3:28:54.920 --> 3:29:01.880]  books no this can be a very different system coming this will be the download the interface
[3:29:01.880 --> 3:29:10.440]  you see the worldwide mind that even pbs did a special on by that night look it up the worldwide
[3:29:10.440 --> 3:29:18.120]  mind the connection of all the brains in the world no privacy then minority report if you
[3:29:18.120 --> 3:29:23.640]  ever saw the movie we'll be living it maybe we already are to a certain extent i believe we
[3:29:23.640 --> 3:29:29.880]  are to a certain extent although they can't reach into everybody's brain right now how they push us
[3:29:29.880 --> 3:29:39.160]  around and hurt us like animals that we are not is what's been happened chinese are really good at
[3:29:39.160 --> 3:29:46.680]  they suppress anything even their own history root belief of energetic science and what it means
[3:29:46.680 --> 3:29:55.560]  because all of this translates into closer and closer to what we are the closer we get you
[3:29:55.560 --> 3:30:02.280]  know see it's not just moslems and islam they're suppressing in china it's christianity and christians
[3:30:02.280 --> 3:30:11.080]  too and it's uh fagong and everyone else anyone that looks deeper than the flesh and the search
[3:30:11.080 --> 3:30:19.800]  for death is necessary for everyone and you get that search by looking seeking so you can find
[3:30:19.800 --> 3:30:24.920]  something look at the story of solemn he went everywhere he looked at every occult thing in
[3:30:24.920 --> 3:30:29.320]  his time if he were living today and doing those studies there'd be a lot of christians want to
[3:30:29.320 --> 3:30:35.880]  burn him at the stake okay but it was his path he learned a lot became the wisest man in the world
[3:30:35.880 --> 3:30:41.000]  as a result so don't judge another man's path judge your own let god judge the path of the
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:45.640]  other man because judging not less to be judged and i think that has a lot of power in it
[3:30:46.680 --> 3:30:51.640]  but you can make a judgment don't be too hard on yourself but make a judgment about yourself
[3:30:51.640 --> 3:30:56.600]  are you engaging the world in a way you should only you can answer that question no one else
[3:30:56.600 --> 3:31:00.840]  can answer that for you even though a lot of people will try and you might have been one of
[3:31:00.840 --> 3:31:05.960]  those trying to tell someone else's programming too but here's a deal you know your flaws better
[3:31:05.960 --> 3:31:12.120]  than anyone except god you know them all no one else does but if you're so critical and so hard
[3:31:12.120 --> 3:31:17.960]  on yourself and you crush yourself with your own criticism this is judgment against the creation
[3:31:19.960 --> 3:31:27.480]  let me say that again this is you making such a harsh judgment of something created in the image
[3:31:27.480 --> 3:31:36.680]  and likeness of god yourself okay be critical be correcting change you know repentance is about
[3:31:36.680 --> 3:31:40.120]  change not about just saying i'm sorry and going on and doing whatever you're doing saying you're
[3:31:40.120 --> 3:31:44.520]  sorry a bunch of times and showing up for the priest say oh i'm sorry no it's about change
[3:31:44.520 --> 3:31:49.720]  fundamental change but that comes from knowing and then deciding and then acting and doing and
[3:31:49.720 --> 3:31:55.160]  falling back into your power has created human beings so you get your power back and then miraculous
[3:31:55.160 --> 3:31:59.640]  things begin to happen in your life and everyone around you says oh there are no options then
[3:32:00.360 --> 3:32:07.880]  that is the option so the suppression of the human spirit is what the chai comms recognize
[3:32:07.880 --> 3:32:16.840]  and the globalists recognize and they use fear and all manner of control to accomplish that
[3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:23.800]  and that is becoming more widespread china's just the model to look at globalist look at it that's
[3:32:23.800 --> 3:32:28.440]  where they're making most of their money look at where they've made their money over the last
[3:32:29.160 --> 3:32:39.560]  40 50 years since 1971 when we opened up china with nixon and and and uh kissinger we closed the
[3:32:39.560 --> 3:32:45.240]  gold window we opened china they went from bicycles to Mercedes and here we are in the
[3:32:45.240 --> 3:32:52.600]  united states with the chinese virus and millions unemployed and they've killed a few hundred thousand
[3:32:52.600 --> 3:32:59.960]  and they killed a few million and how many died in vietnam 57 000 they've already done five times
[3:32:59.960 --> 3:33:05.320]  as many in the u.s and not a shot's been fired it's the chinese virus ladies and gentlemen
[3:33:05.320 --> 3:33:10.440]  and i'm not saying chinese are bad people i'm saying whoever did that are bad people regardless
[3:33:10.440 --> 3:33:18.440]  of who they are but what i do know is whoever's taking advantage of this opportunity are not our
[3:33:18.440 --> 3:33:23.800]  friends and they're not necessarily their own allies they just have different agendas and they're
[3:33:23.800 --> 3:33:30.600]  all zeroing in on the opportunity to screw americans screw the planet and we're the info wars and we
[3:33:30.600 --> 3:33:38.760]  are the wall against that this big baggage will be right back i know black rolling
[3:33:39.720 --> 3:33:42.920]  Alex Jones here with an important message all of our listeners viewers i want to thank you for
[3:33:42.920 --> 3:33:47.480]  your support over the years i want to thank you for having skin in the game and no one has had
[3:33:47.480 --> 3:33:52.440]  more skin in the game than our president and he needs our prayers he needs our support he is
[3:33:52.440 --> 3:33:56.600]  the president secretary of state Pompeo understands that's why he said yesterday
[3:33:56.600 --> 3:34:01.080]  there will be a smooth transition from this trump administration into the next
[3:34:01.080 --> 3:34:07.000]  administration because in all the major states where they're still counting they are gaining
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:11.320]  ground that is president trump the republican party the american people the populace the
[3:34:11.320 --> 3:34:16.440]  patriots the enemy the democrats backed by the shy comms backed by the european union backed by
[3:34:16.440 --> 3:34:21.800]  hollywood backed by the left the blue cities the blue states they are in a rage trying to gaslight
[3:34:21.800 --> 3:34:28.120]  us keep calling by the president elect he's not president has to concede and or all of the states
[3:34:28.120 --> 3:34:32.280]  have to certify the vote which hasn't happened yet and then you have to have the electors
[3:34:32.280 --> 3:34:36.680]  seek who is going to be the president and this may be a dispute that goes back to the states
[3:34:36.680 --> 3:34:41.400]  that's why it's in the constitution and the constitution's kicking in warning warning
[3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:49.240]  warning there is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover the giant third world collapse
[3:34:49.240 --> 3:34:54.360]  and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new covid lockdown announced by globalist
[3:34:54.360 --> 3:35:02.200]  systems in europe in asia and now in the united states joe bite is set to announce today that he
[3:35:02.200 --> 3:35:07.880]  has a new covid task force that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude
[3:35:07.880 --> 3:35:15.160]  contact tracing forced inoculations coming but most importantly a new lockdown that way he can
[3:35:15.160 --> 3:35:21.880]  say that trump is to blame for covid and claim that only a new lockdown will stop covid then of
[3:35:21.880 --> 3:35:26.600]  course when that new lockdown doesn't work those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going
[3:35:26.600 --> 3:35:31.000]  to be blamed for it and that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next

[3:37:39.800 --> 3:38:04.360]  set you're listening to the alex jones show live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:09.880]  it's nick baggage you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:38:13.480 --> 3:38:18.440]  hey i want to say thanks for being here on this friday afternoon i always try and not
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:25.400]  get the force up fourth hour as uh i know you everyone's heard all the details of all the
[3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:32.840]  garbage going on with the election alex has been uh incredible uh we're getting people out there to
[3:38:32.840 --> 3:38:38.200]  be talking about this issue um and i and i try to not kind of get into all of the same
[3:38:38.760 --> 3:38:43.720]  themes and i try to take this last hour and and kind of wrap the week up with maybe a
[3:38:43.720 --> 3:38:50.680]  little bit of a lift lift up at least that's my hope uh in all of this because i'm just that way
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:56.200]  it's i'm a pathological optimist i can't help myself and i believe in this republic and i believe
[3:38:56.200 --> 3:39:03.080]  in living human souls and i believe that we win this this battle in the end and uh we win it in
[3:39:03.080 --> 3:39:09.400]  the flesh we win it in the spirit we win it period so it's we're in it to win it um and this is what
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:13.800]  i would say too now i talked a little bit about china in the last segments i want to say this
[3:39:13.800 --> 3:39:18.520]  because i don't know if there's people out there in china listening i hope there are i really do
[3:39:18.520 --> 3:39:24.920]  because here's what i know all around the planet people hear this program and hear this broadcast
[3:39:24.920 --> 3:39:31.320]  and hear our voices individually and collectively your voices too everyone we speak to this matters
[3:39:31.320 --> 3:39:39.080]  right now and if we do just a little bit to make uh a situation happen where people begin to look
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:45.080]  again to seek the truth and to begin to really try and discern what's real and what isn't as we begin
[3:39:45.080 --> 3:39:50.840]  to push into the world instead of being pushed around we got to find our power in that and so
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:57.000]  for that we have to let go of fear we have to let go of anxiety now this is pretty rough you know i
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:05.960]  mean in fact i think it's by design if you think about it it is by design if we are kept in that
[3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:14.520]  state because that's when we're the most vulnerable and the least capable now when i say that it's not
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:21.960]  a metaphor it's not kind of like oh i think this the science proves this it's what i've been writing
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:30.600]  about for most of my career in terms of this this area of technology is this technology that either
[3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:37.320]  liberates us or frees us it's the airplane that drops from or delivers the mail okay it's the
[3:40:37.320 --> 3:40:45.800]  operator that gets to decide that's both individually with us and collectively as a country as a state
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:51.640]  as a local locality and other countries and then globally what we do to kind of get along
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:58.040]  and here's some things i i want to bring out again and it used to be the john birchers warning
[3:40:58.040 --> 3:41:03.960]  about all this and everybody poo pooing them in the 60s and then now all that stuff is now
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:09.960]  mainstream and i don't know what their agenda is today but it's kind of like well you were right
[3:41:09.960 --> 3:41:14.840]  but nobody paid attention and i look at this what were they saying they were talking about new world
[3:41:14.840 --> 3:41:20.520]  order there was a good book none dare call a conspiracy i highly recommend it gary ellen i
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:25.720]  read it years and years ago and there was another one he wrote called jimmy carter jimmy carter and
[3:41:25.720 --> 3:41:34.360]  i recommend that one too nineteen 1970s vintage you know the the story has been told over and over
[3:41:34.360 --> 3:41:41.080]  again but a lot of people haven't heard it the mainstream is really shutting it down there's
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:48.200]  a cover on the screen you know and so you have all these things happening in the world and really
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:55.800]  it's about silencing our voices and this is what we can't allow to happen and in these last days of
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:42:01.400]  the fire drill we're seeing some things now i know only was talking about what was going on with
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:05.640]  trump's press release now what press comps now why was he talking about those because these are
[3:42:05.640 --> 3:42:09.640]  the things you couldn't legislate because big pharma doesn't want any of this legislate there's
[3:42:09.640 --> 3:42:14.360]  things they don't want legislated executive order is the order of the day let's get our speech back
[3:42:14.360 --> 3:42:22.680]  let's shut down these uh tech giants that are now directing the speech traffic and filtering speech
[3:42:22.680 --> 3:42:28.120]  out no they're public conveyances they can't do that these are the airwaves they don't own them
[3:42:28.120 --> 3:42:33.000]  let's just take them away they can keep the money they have but we got to take them away
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:39.240]  and restore order to the public airwaves so all voices can be heard and no one gets to filter them
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:49.880]  out that's the only public order is that you know we cannot allow the owners of the media now
[3:42:49.880 --> 3:42:56.760]  to control the airwaves which are all of ours this was the principles of the FCC see nobody
[3:42:56.760 --> 3:43:01.160]  remembers any of this because when radio was invented is where these discussions happened
[3:43:01.160 --> 3:43:07.640]  over a hundred years ago see no one's having the discussions today because we just let it kind of
[3:43:07.640 --> 3:43:16.680]  ooze its way in or one slice at a time until the baloney is all gone and we don't notice
[3:43:16.680 --> 3:43:22.920]  they're the slow boil of the frog whatever example you want to use but you got to live long enough
[3:43:22.920 --> 3:43:27.880]  and have a memory strong enough and i pray to god i keep mine for another 40 years and can keep
[3:43:27.880 --> 3:43:33.720]  talking because then i'll have a hundred years of experience instead of just the 62 i have right now
[3:43:33.720 --> 3:43:41.480]  and you all of you together we have millions of years of experience think about this
[3:43:42.120 --> 3:43:48.680]  collectively we have millions of years of experience in your household the two adults
[3:43:48.680 --> 3:43:52.600]  and the children how many years of experience do you have it's all different experience all
[3:43:52.600 --> 3:43:57.640]  seen through your individual filters when our consciousness comes together we don't need to
[3:43:57.640 --> 3:44:10.280]  wait for some ai assisted worldwide mind we already have one we're in it we're in it it's what we were
[3:44:10.280 --> 3:44:17.160]  created to be it's who we are and and again i want to say um in the context of the of the world
[3:44:17.160 --> 3:44:23.880]  right now people are being suppressed in all different ways and when people are suppressed
[3:44:23.880 --> 3:44:28.840]  they get angry because that runs against who we are it's created human beings we're not meant to be
[3:44:29.560 --> 3:44:37.240]  under house arrest in jail without having anyone uh bringing us our meals
[3:44:39.320 --> 3:44:45.320]  you know we're in jail folks if we succumb to this because it'll be one slice at a time it
[3:44:45.320 --> 3:44:51.240]  started remember it was only 15 days and now we're nine months in and the lockdowns look like
[3:44:51.240 --> 3:44:58.280]  they're coming you know what is going on here folks house arrest and we're all buying in and
[3:44:58.280 --> 3:45:04.440]  then they're going to allocate a little money to everyone to hush money let's call it well the banks
[3:45:04.440 --> 3:45:10.440]  are running the skim game of taking a little bit off the top you know and and it's like they've
[3:45:10.440 --> 3:45:15.960]  just created a whole new context of words to make us feel good oh it's a quarantine it's not jail
[3:45:15.960 --> 3:45:25.160]  oh it's an allocation it's a tax refund it's not a allowance you know this is nonsense folks um
[3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:30.120]  really let's look at the effect okay let's not think about the words and the illusion
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:36.040]  let's think of the effect do you feel free do you feel liberated do you feel sovereign
[3:45:37.160 --> 3:45:43.080]  if you don't something's wrong because that's what we were created to be three sovereign
[3:45:43.080 --> 3:45:48.280]  living souls in the image and likeness of god being creative doing creative work not being
[3:45:48.280 --> 3:45:53.240]  diminished and told we're nothing that we're some herd that needs to be herded we're a group of
[3:45:53.240 --> 3:45:57.880]  taxpayers and you just pay or that we're just consumers just need to keep grabbing and eating
[3:45:57.880 --> 3:46:03.880]  and hey they'll just crank out more money so we can just consume no that is not what we were created
[3:46:03.880 --> 3:46:09.640]  to do a lot of people have lost in that illusion that's a third deal that's her hopefully they'll
[3:46:09.640 --> 3:46:17.160]  find a way out but our individual path that dictates what we do is based on a set of values
[3:46:17.160 --> 3:46:21.880]  and those values are being lost in the shuffle let's not let that happen as we roll into this
[3:46:22.520 --> 3:46:29.720]  next decade of unrest kicking in but let's get some executive orders going let's get our speech
[3:46:29.720 --> 3:46:36.840]  back let's do as much as we can well we can just in case the chai comms win the fights that are
[3:46:36.840 --> 3:46:42.280]  taking place right now and i know trump's team is on it uh they've got the best team i imagine in
[3:46:42.280 --> 3:46:48.520]  the world on it hopefully this thing gets quickly to the us supreme court the evidence gets weighed
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:55.240]  and testimony gets heard from individuals that can lend an ear to the truth in this so we can see
[3:46:55.240 --> 3:47:01.560]  what happened because one thing is for sure half the country doubts the outcome of this election
[3:47:01.560 --> 3:47:07.800]  and that's too many we can't have that we can't go forward into this this century doubting our
[3:47:07.800 --> 3:47:15.400]  elect electoral processes these have to be dealt with and i've said it before and i say it again
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:23.080]  these machines cannot be trusted they can't computers cannot be trusted to be foolproof
[3:47:23.720 --> 3:47:30.200]  they aren't that's the business of the info wars you know that are taking place outside
[3:47:30.200 --> 3:47:39.320]  of this venue these are the real wars going on at a very very high level and alex as a visionary
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:46.760]  grabbed that name right i mean because he saw he saw he saw it 25 years ago and my slogan back then
[3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:54.920]  was changing the way we see the world because what i was seeing was way different than what the
[3:47:54.920 --> 3:48:00.600]  mainstream was seeing and so change the way we see the world is gather the information and make
[3:48:00.600 --> 3:48:05.480]  new judgments make a judgment about your life today and how you're going to engage the world
[3:48:05.480 --> 3:48:10.360]  this weekend this is dr nick baggots and you've been listening to the info wars the most important
