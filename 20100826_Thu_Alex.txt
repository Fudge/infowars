[02:09.000 --> 02:14.200]  informative on our quest to awaken and inform the population about the true
[02:14.200 --> 02:20.080]  nature of our planet today obviously huge developments on the economy we're
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.640]  going to be going over that Finland is the latest nation to suspend the swine
[02:24.640 --> 02:31.400]  flu shot completely saying it's linked to Guillaume beret to narcolepsy where
[02:31.400 --> 02:36.800]  you basically just pass out and then wake up when you're driving a car when
[02:36.800 --> 02:40.320]  you're sitting in a restaurant when you're watching television it literally
[02:40.320 --> 02:43.160]  hundreds of different neurological disorders it just fries the brain does
[02:43.160 --> 02:46.440]  different things different people England of course a month ago suspended
[02:46.440 --> 02:50.280]  the flu shots for five and under is because of a tenfold the government
[02:50.280 --> 02:55.080]  admits increase in convulsions I mean it's so obvious they're having to even
[02:55.080 --> 03:00.400]  back off more news now coming out three plus years into the carnage of the
[03:00.400 --> 03:04.600]  deaths and illnesses caused by Gardasil that supposedly blocks the
[03:04.600 --> 03:07.920]  transmission of the human papillomavirus that is linked to about three
[03:07.920 --> 03:11.920]  thousand cancer deaths a year which is substantial but in the aggregate very
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.120]  small and clearly there's a lot more health problems associated in the cost
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.880]  benefit analysis with this attenuated virus injection with a cervical cancer
[03:22.880 --> 03:26.040]  than what it supposedly treats and on the insert of the drug it says it doesn't
[03:26.040 --> 03:29.280]  even protect you from it so we'll be breaking down the latest developments
[03:29.280 --> 03:33.600]  there ahead of well it's already here but the intensified ahead of the
[03:33.600 --> 03:39.160]  intensified push for another hoax where they say you must take the H1N1 shot
[03:39.160 --> 03:46.600]  mixed with the seasonal flu shot this year also we're going to get into the
[03:46.600 --> 03:52.000]  incredible developments in Mexico I'm I'm going to cover this first when we

[04:09.120 --> 04:17.800]  reading Texas Monthly it's got to be 20 plus years ago about repeated times they
[04:17.800 --> 04:22.200]  dig up hundreds of bodies of men women and children who've been tortured to
[04:22.200 --> 04:27.320]  death many times and by cover-up it's been in the Texas news Dallas Morning
[04:27.320 --> 04:31.400]  News Texas Monthly done a good job San Antonio Express News but I see these
[04:31.400 --> 04:39.640]  every month or so their satanic cults that murder hundreds of people it's like
[04:39.640 --> 04:46.840]  dust till dawn or something but it's not vampires it's humans it's insane and it

[08:09.960 --> 08:20.080]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show we're live it's Thursday 26
[08:20.080 --> 08:26.360]  day of August 2010 we've got a retired FBI agent with firsthand intel on the
[08:26.360 --> 08:30.680]  cover-up of the assassination of John F. Kennedy coming up in about 25 minutes
[08:30.680 --> 08:34.200]  and some other extremely informative guest as well I'll tell you about later
[08:34.200 --> 08:41.040]  in the hour the United Nations for two years has been investigating Texas and
[08:41.040 --> 08:44.680]  Arizona saying we should have completely open borders but they don't
[08:44.680 --> 08:50.800]  investigate Mexico that in prisons extorts and murders immigrants from
[08:50.800 --> 08:56.000]  central and South America now Obama has hauled Arizona before the UN Human
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.720]  Rights Council so this is more high treason of course Barack Obama became
[09:00.720 --> 09:05.200]  the first sitting US president and no president ever chaired the UN Security
[09:05.200 --> 09:11.000]  Council even a former president and this is just intensifying the treason and
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.440]  violates the 11th Amendment you cannot sue on behalf of a foreign power or
[09:16.440 --> 09:22.480]  individual or corporation a state or citizen of a state or a citizen of the
[09:22.480 --> 09:27.080]  United States the federal government cannot do that under the bill of rights
[09:27.080 --> 09:33.000]  the 11th Amendment so we're going to be discussing that and just the huge mass
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.800]  graves and extermination centers they're finding all over Mexico where
[09:36.800 --> 09:43.360]  they're murdering the mainly non-Mexican immigrants there's an extreme hatred that
[09:43.360 --> 09:49.320]  the Mexican government and the culture has for anybody outside Mexico if there's
[09:49.320 --> 09:53.840]  more extreme hatred of Guatemala than there is even for the US because Mexico
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.720]  lost a war with them that was Mexico as well and it's just if they don't have
[09:58.720 --> 10:02.440]  money women children they torture him to death they kill him and that's now
[10:02.440 --> 10:06.160]  mainstream news I'm always telling you about this because I live in Texas from
[10:06.160 --> 10:09.800]  the time I was a little child I would see my parents reading the Dallas morning
[10:09.800 --> 10:14.720]  news where they dug up 18 more bodies they'd all been sacrificed the children
[10:14.720 --> 10:18.600]  had their hearts cut out after being raped remember the article earlier this
[10:18.600 --> 10:23.240]  week about the mayor down in a Mexican city that it never really had any crime
[10:23.240 --> 10:26.840]  problems and his own police came to his house took him and killed him and dumped
[10:26.840 --> 10:30.480]  him on the road and the media said he was lucky they didn't rape him and cut his
[10:30.480 --> 10:35.000]  head off well the raping is part of the Satanism and I have mainstream news on
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.520]  that I mean it if you want an actual satanic kingdom where now the most
[10:39.520 --> 10:44.360]  popular made-up saints are the skinny one and it's just pure devil worship
[10:44.360 --> 10:50.400]  running rampant you cannot make this up you cannot make this up and now the
[10:50.400 --> 10:54.760]  southwest is becoming this and the killing of police is beginning and the
[10:54.760 --> 10:58.960]  police will probably bow down to it out of fear and it's over it's over you'll
[10:58.960 --> 11:02.640]  be kidnapped you'll be sacrificed your children well and nothing will be done
[11:02.640 --> 11:08.280]  you you cannot stop the pure evil in Mexico unless you shut the border down
[11:08.280 --> 11:12.880]  you cannot stop it is probably the most evil country on earth what I keep
[11:12.880 --> 11:19.280]  explaining to people okay and it's a cultural fact that it is descending into
[11:19.280 --> 11:24.040]  Hades itself you've got hard-working good Christian people down there but
[11:24.040 --> 11:29.280]  they're being completely just supplanted by some of the older more devilish
[11:29.280 --> 11:36.520]  things that went on in the culture pre pre-colonial times now I'm gonna put
[11:36.520 --> 11:40.600]  this plug in here briefly because I decided that I'm just gonna do
[11:40.600 --> 11:44.760]  everything I can to get as many DVDs out to people and I'm running specials for

[14:34.600 --> 14:42.280]  to now get into the situation with mexico mexico has been surveyed and
[14:42.280 --> 14:48.040]  estimated by major banks and brokerage firms to have at least three times the
[14:48.040 --> 14:54.360]  natural resources of the united states of the lower forty eight and hawaii and
[14:54.360 --> 15:01.000]  alaska combined oil gold timber rich volcanic soil every other mineral you
[15:01.000 --> 15:07.400]  can imagine it's got hard-working good people that live there but something
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.400]  changed in mexico something allowed it to to to go from just an oppressed
[15:12.400 --> 15:18.640]  people controlled by a powerful elite that had merged with the major new york
[15:18.640 --> 15:25.720]  banks by the 1970s on record a vassal of the globalist under united nations
[15:25.720 --> 15:33.120]  treaties and biospheres they forced much of the indigenous mayan population and
[15:33.120 --> 15:40.000]  other tribes off of their lands all over mexico and forced them to mexico city
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.640]  is a staging ground to the united states this is on record and the ford
[15:43.640 --> 15:47.880]  foundation carney endowment funded this they're on record sixty years ago
[15:47.880 --> 15:52.920]  funding liberation theology going into mexico paying for the textbooks with the
[15:52.920 --> 15:57.880]  average sixth grade education that the united states must be brought down that
[15:57.880 --> 16:01.920]  it belongs to mexico and that mexico is in the plight it is not because of the
[16:01.920 --> 16:05.400]  globalist but because of the american people so it took the existing
[16:05.400 --> 16:09.520]  nationalism and that mexico had lost wars and conflicts with us that was just
[16:09.520 --> 16:13.120]  a kernel of anger and distrust and there had been some discrimination against
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.360]  hispanics from mexico you in the history of this country as well especially for
[16:18.360 --> 16:21.200]  mexico attacked the united states again actually over a third of those that
[16:21.200 --> 16:24.320]  founded texas were hispanic the father of the constitution but then race
[16:24.320 --> 16:28.760]  relations degenerated after that mainly just over fighting over land i mean
[16:28.760 --> 16:33.840]  white people were killing white people for land as well i mean it it it was
[16:33.840 --> 16:38.720]  wild but but they particularly ganged up and picked on hispanics so that went on
[16:38.720 --> 16:42.920]  and so all of this anger got generated in the ford foundation others sixty plus
[16:42.920 --> 16:49.760]  years ago about the 1940s what's almost 70 years ago man time flies and they went
[16:49.760 --> 16:55.240]  in there and did this and then in the seventies eighties and nineties and i've
[16:55.240 --> 16:59.600]  been in yucatan i've been in other areas of mexico with the big signs you in
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.440]  biosphere land for sale and they stole the people's property that they've been
[17:04.440 --> 17:07.680]  on for thousands of years they didn't have deeds for it they pushed them off
[17:07.680 --> 17:13.520]  their corn farms and they have happy good people and they sent them up to
[17:13.520 --> 17:17.760]  mexico city now thirty plus million people living in hell they have what

[24:10.600 --> 24:17.800]  collapse of our Republic with Dan Dix coming up the next hour but as we talk
[24:17.800 --> 24:22.000]  about in the film fall of the Republic President Obama has brazenly violated
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.120]  article one section nine of the US Constitution by feeding himself at the
[24:26.120 --> 24:29.280]  head of the United Nations Security Council thus becoming the first US
[24:29.280 --> 24:36.320]  president to chair the world body and here it is today Obama hauls Arizona
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.080]  before the UN Human Rights Council not only is the federal government suing
[24:41.080 --> 24:47.320]  Arizona on behalf of foreigners now he's taking him to the UN do you see the UN
[24:47.320 --> 24:52.120]  going after Mexico where they admittedly take the government itself takes
[24:52.120 --> 24:55.720]  immigrants from Latin America and other countries that try to get into the US
[24:55.720 --> 24:59.400]  through Mexico and put them in slave camps and run their credit and demand
[24:59.400 --> 25:05.240]  every bit of money they can out of their families overseas no that's not
[25:05.240 --> 25:11.120]  being discussed are the mass graves they find on a weekly basis normally this
[25:11.120 --> 25:18.440]  doesn't even make the news normally you just see it in regional news but it
[25:18.440 --> 25:22.280]  doesn't make the national news and this is part of the North American Union
[25:22.280 --> 25:27.680]  here's another report US Census counted everyone as a citizen now here's Fox
[25:27.680 --> 25:31.800]  News there's also AP Reuters reporting the exact same thing we'll put it up on
[25:31.800 --> 25:38.520]  screen for you survivor details massacre of 72 migrants by drug cartel in
[25:38.520 --> 25:43.520]  Mexico and he escaped like a concentration camp victim and got to the
[25:43.520 --> 25:48.800]  local police station who guaranteed knows that Los Zetas is sanctioned by the
[25:48.800 --> 25:53.160]  Mexican government and the US government and they're the muscle going after the
[25:53.160 --> 25:57.880]  other cartels that don't want to their money through the central banks a wounded
[25:57.880 --> 26:01.480]  migrants stumbled into a military checkpoint and led Marines to a gruesome
[26:01.480 --> 26:06.200]  scene what may be the biggest massacre so far in Mexico's bloody drug war no
[26:06.200 --> 26:11.600]  it's not a room strewn with the bodies of 72 fellow travelers some piled on top
[26:11.600 --> 26:17.480]  of each other just a hundred miles from the goal the US border Texas the 58 men
[26:17.480 --> 26:22.160]  14 women were killed the migrant toll investigators Wednesday by the Zetas
[26:22.160 --> 26:26.760]  cartel a group of former Mexican Army special forces known to extort migrants
[26:26.760 --> 26:31.080]  who pass through their territory that's why you got a shut down the border you've
[26:31.080 --> 26:35.320]  got hundreds of millions of people from Latin America and Mexico trying to get
[26:35.320 --> 26:40.480]  here who live in hell and once they get here the government turns them into an
[26:40.480 --> 26:47.280]  army of anti-gun big government voters they they go to public schools and are
[26:47.280 --> 26:50.880]  so angry by citizens wearing American flags the citizens are sent home
[26:50.880 --> 26:54.840]  they're pulling down American flags at post offices and schools running up
[26:54.840 --> 27:00.160]  Mexican flags and then nobody's talking about Mexico where the people are
[27:00.160 --> 27:04.920]  literally preyed on including US citizens now used to have you went to one of the
[27:04.920 --> 27:08.040]  controlled areas for tourists you wouldn't get kidnapped by the police and
[27:08.040 --> 27:12.840]  extorted but now you go to Cancun other areas the same thing happens that'll
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.480]  happen in central Mexico or northern Mexico but the travel agents won't tell
[27:17.480 --> 27:20.640]  you that people send their high school graduates down there to be raped and
[27:20.640 --> 27:25.800]  robbed and killed and it's happening every day Mexico is a completely failed
[27:25.800 --> 27:33.880]  state it goes on to talk about the horrifying example yet of the plight of
[27:33.880 --> 27:37.440]  migrants trying to cross the country where drug cartels are increasingly
[27:37.440 --> 27:42.920]  scouting shelters and highways hoping to extort or even recruit vulnerable
[27:42.920 --> 27:46.880]  immigrants it's absolutely terrible and it demands the condemnation of all our
[27:46.880 --> 27:54.160]  society so government security spokesman of Mexico well it's very simple they if
[27:54.160 --> 27:57.760]  they don't have money they kill them they rape the women they pull up to
[27:57.760 --> 28:03.120]  mayor's offices grab the mayor kill them many cases rape them torture them they
[28:03.120 --> 28:06.840]  attacked US embassy and what killed five employees just a month or so ago
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.920]  they're now killing ranchers on the Texas and Arizona side they've now got
[28:10.920 --> 28:14.080]  hits out on police they're killing police I've interviewed the sheriffs in
[28:14.080 --> 28:18.360]  Texas many miles over the border Mexican troops pull up aim guns at them the
[28:18.360 --> 28:25.640]  Mexican troops help bring the drugs in and then Obama is suing Arizona and now
[28:25.640 --> 28:32.440]  sicken the UN a foreign criminal consortium on Arizona because Arizona
[28:32.440 --> 28:38.880]  would dare to try to deport illegals see they talk about the plight of
[28:38.880 --> 28:43.640]  migrants oh we're not putting enough water stations out in the desert for
[28:43.640 --> 28:49.880]  them we can't build a fence oh we're gonna put 1200 trips on the border with a
[28:49.880 --> 28:54.040]  couple hundred on shift anyone time doing nothing the border patrol is
[28:54.040 --> 28:56.880]  announced they're pulling back from the border in Arizona because it's quote too
[28:56.880 --> 29:01.640]  dangerous and then they pull on our heartstrings and say we've got a merge
[29:01.640 --> 29:06.240]  with Mexico we've got to accept anybody who wants to come in we've got to do
[29:06.240 --> 29:10.240]  this no we need to stop funding the government of Mexico we need to demand
[29:10.240 --> 29:15.440]  they totally decriminalized drugs and it will end all of this violence very very
[29:15.440 --> 29:21.400]  quickly but you've got 500 billion a year coming out of Mexico and drugs you
[29:21.400 --> 29:25.240]  got 500 plus billion in opium coming in Afghanistan and the criminal banks that
[29:25.240 --> 29:30.560]  run our nation and run Mexico are the ones controlling it and if you read
[29:30.560 --> 29:34.920]  deeply into these reports many of the people they dig up I mean there's been
[29:34.920 --> 29:38.280]  hundreds of abductions out of El Paso where they take the women over to the
[29:38.280 --> 29:43.400]  other side torture them rape them sacrifice them this is lunacy insanity
[29:43.400 --> 29:47.880]  as sees control of Mexico and it's spilling over and taking over the
[29:47.880 --> 29:55.440]  United States we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:02.080 --> 33:13.480]  it's Alex Jones I'll be getting back into the North American Union and have a
[33:13.480 --> 33:19.040]  private consortium of banks is dissolving our sovereignty through treason
[33:19.040 --> 33:23.880]  at the presidential and congressional level as they sign away our authority
[33:23.880 --> 33:29.560]  Obama is not only suing Arizona he's now going to the UN asking them to go
[33:29.560 --> 33:35.160]  out to Arizona that is coming up but for the rest of this hour and five minutes
[33:35.160 --> 33:39.560]  into the next hour Don Adams who we talked about in the last two days a
[33:39.560 --> 33:48.200]  decorated Korean War vet retired FBI agent who was investigating one of the
[33:48.200 --> 33:51.600]  people he has evidence was involved in the JFK assassination before it even
[33:51.600 --> 33:58.200]  happened saw a subsequent cover-up the information he has literally blows the
[33:58.200 --> 34:04.920]  JFK murder and assassination and cover-up sky-high and it integrates with the
[34:04.920 --> 34:09.080]  deathbed confession of E Howard Hunt that we broke here on air with his son
[34:09.080 --> 34:14.520]  the audio and video and with all of the research I've done in the last 15 years
[34:14.520 --> 34:19.520]  and of course the congressional report in the late 70s finding 95% chance it
[34:19.520 --> 34:25.520]  was a conspiracy not just Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone so I'd like Don to
[34:25.520 --> 34:31.360]  go back to his time at the FBI before the JFK assassination and and and go
[34:31.360 --> 34:36.240]  through the newly released documents that concur the fact that he got his own
[34:36.240 --> 34:41.200]  FBI reports out of the archives that they've been altered and just the
[34:41.200 --> 34:45.760]  amazing information because that's what E Howard Hunt said that the killing was
[34:45.760 --> 34:52.680]  planned in Miami and they have the Miami intelligence police interviewing the
[34:52.680 --> 34:58.680]  person who was photographed in Dealey Plaza the individual that Mr. Adams was
[34:58.680 --> 35:03.560]  tracking and it fits in with a secret service agent that said they were going
[35:03.560 --> 35:08.800]  to try to kill JFK in Chicago but that called out got called off because he
[35:08.800 --> 35:13.400]  blew the whistle same thing that hunt is now saying right before he died I mean
[35:13.400 --> 35:17.280]  it's incredible information then he'll get into the physical evidence as well
[35:17.280 --> 35:24.520]  the impossibility of the official story so retired FBI agent Don Adams is here
[35:24.520 --> 35:27.720]  blowing the whistle he has a lot of courage sir thank you for coming on
[35:27.720 --> 35:33.720]  with us thanks Alex you've got the floor of the websites Adams JFK.com you got a
[35:33.720 --> 35:36.880]  book coming out in the next few months you've also got a DVD breaking this
[35:36.880 --> 35:42.080]  down but you've got the floor go over to sir all right I will my
[35:42.080 --> 35:49.840]  investigation started in November on November the 13th of 1963 I received a
[35:49.840 --> 35:54.840]  telephone call from the agent in charge in the Atlanta FBI office he told me
[35:54.840 --> 35:59.640]  that they had just received information from a secret service of a conspiracy
[35:59.640 --> 36:04.520]  discussion that took place up in Indianapolis Indiana at a meeting of a
[36:04.520 --> 36:13.040]  large group of very strong right-wingers and as a result of it there was one of
[36:13.040 --> 36:17.240]  the people in a discussion of four people where who was an informant for
[36:17.240 --> 36:22.480]  the Miami Intelligence Police Department as well as for the FBI his name is
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.440]  William Somerset the principal person that was talking in the group of four
[36:27.440 --> 36:35.600]  was Joseph Adams Miltier Joseph Adams Miltier and Somerset with the other two
[36:35.600 --> 36:42.040]  fellows they planned I mean they discussed about the assassination of
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.760]  President Kennedy when he left Homestead Air Force based in Miami, Florida and
[36:46.760 --> 36:54.120]  traveled up Collins Avenue to the Kennedy compound in Palm Beach, Florida they
[36:54.120 --> 36:58.080]  were going to take a secretive man who was wanting to give his life up in a
[36:58.080 --> 37:06.120]  palm tree and then when the motorcade with the open limousine came by they
[37:06.120 --> 37:12.360]  were going to go ahead and shoot the president that person was a sniper in a
[37:12.360 --> 37:17.640]  Second World War and so they planned on killing him there if that failed for
[37:17.640 --> 37:24.080]  whatever reason they had a backup plan in at the White House behind Lafayette
[37:24.080 --> 37:28.120]  Park which is right across the street from the from the White House and they
[37:28.120 --> 37:33.240]  had purchased or more rented an apartment or an office and they had
[37:33.240 --> 37:38.720]  purchased a high-powered rifle with a tripod and they were going to shoot the
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.720]  president when he came out onto the portico of the White House or on or if
[37:43.720 --> 37:51.680]  he walked the grounds and that was a backup plan so all this was discussed
[37:51.680 --> 37:58.360]  and as a result of it the Secret Service called RSAC and asked for me to ask
[37:58.360 --> 38:02.480]  for an investigation to be conducted in the SAC called me and said Don since
[38:02.480 --> 38:06.360]  military lives in Whitman, Georgia and your territory I want you to do a full
[38:06.360 --> 38:12.400]  background on him so I contacted the police chief down there William Elliott
[38:12.400 --> 38:18.480]  and Bill and I went to work on on military and we spent about five days
[38:18.480 --> 38:24.640]  working full-time gathering as much intelligence as we possibly could on him
[38:24.640 --> 38:29.760]  once we acquired all the intelligence that we could get I then took and
[38:29.760 --> 38:35.880]  prepared a report and a pretty extensive report I acquired a lot of hand out
[38:35.880 --> 38:42.600]  material from him which he mammographed and he handed out every Saturday to all
[38:42.600 --> 38:47.160]  of the people that would take it and I took a lot of that material from him and
[38:47.160 --> 38:54.200]  there was an awful lot of bitterness and and indications not direct threats but
[38:54.200 --> 38:58.600]  implied threats against the president and Bobby and them so I took all that
[38:58.600 --> 39:02.600]  material and I put it all together and then hand carried my report I wrote my
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.360]  report I hand carried it up to Atlanta gave it to the boss and then turned it
[39:07.360 --> 39:13.000]  over to the Secret Service and we were through with it but that was our total
[39:13.000 --> 39:19.400]  investigation I finished probably around the the 18th or 19th I can't give you an
[39:19.400 --> 39:26.800]  exact date but around and and then a course on November 22nd at 1 30 in
[39:26.800 --> 39:31.560]  afternoon my partner and I were riding in the car and an announcement came out
[39:31.560 --> 39:36.120]  and said that the president had been shot in Dallas and then there was a cold
[39:36.120 --> 39:43.560]  ready a radio code for code 36 for us to go to the Thomasville Georgia Highway
[39:43.560 --> 39:48.600]  Patrol post and that they had a message from me so I went there identified
[39:48.600 --> 39:52.600]  myself and he then said to me the sergeant behind the desk that we were
[39:52.600 --> 39:56.080]  going to go to the Department of Agriculture they have a teletype they
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.480]  want me to read so we took off went to the Department of Agriculture and once we
[40:00.480 --> 40:06.400]  got inside and looked at the teletype the teletype read the president is dead
[40:06.400 --> 40:12.000]  call your special agent in charge in Atlanta immediately so then I
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  immediately I mean I was shocked and devastated because here it is so close
[40:16.000 --> 40:22.000]  to what I was doing and and now they're talking about to call the Boston that
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.720]  so I called my boss and he says find military where wherever he is and hold
[40:27.720 --> 40:32.040]  him for the secret service and I'm devastated because I'm thinking I must
[40:32.040 --> 40:36.120]  just screwed up somehow or made a mess mess of something or something happened
[40:36.120 --> 40:42.480]  because of the close proximity and time I went out and I started looking for
[40:42.480 --> 40:48.800]  military hunting him to all of his Hansen and wherever he was and I went from
[40:48.800 --> 40:56.400]  November 22nd till November the 27th and located in my 27th the first
[40:56.400 --> 41:01.320]  indication that I had that there was something going wrong was that my agent
[41:01.320 --> 41:06.480]  in charge told me that when you interview military you can only ask these five
[41:06.480 --> 41:10.720]  questions and nothing more and I queried my boss and I said boss wait a minute
[41:10.720 --> 41:15.400]  we're passing up a very important opportunity here to find out who he
[41:15.400 --> 41:19.280]  associated with where he went who he met in his travels and and everything
[41:19.280 --> 41:22.600]  else and maybe I can get a lot of information from me said I only want
[41:22.600 --> 41:27.000]  you to ask these five questions and nothing more so I did I mean when we
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.760]  when we interviewed him I took this the statements on those five questions he
[41:31.760 --> 41:35.320]  denied any involvement in the assassination and one of them was
[41:35.320 --> 41:40.800]  concerning Martin Luther King there was any threats on him and he denied any of
[41:40.800 --> 41:47.320]  that information and it's a result of it I called my boss and the boss said go
[41:47.320 --> 41:50.920]  ahead and release him since he didn't give me anything of a positive nature and
[41:50.920 --> 41:55.000]  that and the Secret Service will contact you if they decide they want him
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.880]  located there and they want to talk to him and that's the last I heard of him
[41:58.880 --> 42:04.720]  and I forgot all about it then seven months later I was transferred to Dallas
[42:04.720 --> 42:10.640]  Texas when I got to Dallas Texas the first thing that my boss said to me was
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.800]  I want you to look at the Zabruder film I went in and looked at the Zabruder
[42:14.800 --> 42:20.200]  film when I looked at the Zabruder film I saw him I saw the president take his
[42:20.200 --> 42:24.240]  hands and go up towards his throat with his hands and I made a comment with two
[42:24.240 --> 42:27.880]  senior agents sitting there with me and I said hell he didn't get shot from the
[42:27.880 --> 42:32.400]  back he got shot from the front and I was cautioned by one of the agents and
[42:32.400 --> 42:36.400]  said Don the Warren Commission's already in here working to get this thing
[42:36.400 --> 42:41.280]  established in that and I would kind of hold your comments to yourself I left
[42:41.280 --> 42:44.640]  there a couple days later with two other senior agents and went to the book
[42:44.640 --> 42:48.240]  your posthory when I got the book posthory I looked out the window and
[42:48.240 --> 42:52.280]  looked down on Elm Street and there was a tree in full foliage and I asked the two
[42:52.280 --> 42:57.880]  agents I said was that tree bearer at the time when the assassination of
[42:57.880 --> 43:04.360]  place I said no the timing is that's not like you have back at home in Ohio the
[43:04.360 --> 43:09.120]  leaves were still on there in November and they're still on in June yeah live
[43:09.120 --> 43:14.880]  oaks dropped their leaves in the summer yes okay which they did do so as a
[43:14.880 --> 43:20.360]  result of it I made a comment I said there's no way in a world with the if
[43:20.360 --> 43:26.280]  the foliage is all up there there's no way in the world that this individual
[43:26.280 --> 43:31.360]  Oswald I know he was unnamed at that time but whoever the individual was that
[43:31.360 --> 43:36.520]  did the shooting in that that he oh no I'm sorry his name is already identified
[43:36.520 --> 43:43.000]  six months later but anyway this individual could not have possibly made
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.160]  those shots read three shots and seven and a half seconds and again I was
[43:47.160 --> 43:52.480]  cautioned and said be careful what you say so then that was my completion as
[43:52.480 --> 43:56.760]  far as I covered a couple of leads on the on the assassination when I worked in
[43:56.760 --> 44:00.880]  Dallas and then subsequently I made my transfers and stuff went back to Ohio and
[44:00.880 --> 44:10.760]  forgot all about no tear in November of 1992 at Christmas time we had a get
[44:10.760 --> 44:14.840]  together at a house there and one of the fellas that was there his it was a son
[44:14.840 --> 44:18.840]  of a friend of mine he said mr. Adamus I understand that you're involved in the
[44:18.840 --> 44:23.120]  assassination investigation and I'm a buff for that could you could you talk
[44:23.120 --> 44:28.920]  with me about it I did told him the whole story I just told you and he said
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.680]  fine thank you very much and then he said I'm reading a book in my home in
[44:33.680 --> 44:39.000]  Houston when I finish it I'll send it to you so about a month later I received
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.880]  a book from I received a package from him and inside was the book I opened up
[44:43.880 --> 44:48.240]  the book in the name of the book was high treason and it was written by Robert
[44:48.240 --> 44:54.520]  Groton and William Livingston and when I opened up that I there was a
[44:54.520 --> 44:59.040]  paste of notes on the inside cover and it said Don Adamus Joseph Bay is
[44:59.040 --> 45:05.080]  mentioned in the details are in the appendix good reading Larry so then when
[45:05.080 --> 45:08.240]  I opened it up and went to the index I was thinking to myself hell there's a
[45:08.240 --> 45:12.400]  lot of Joseph a's and I never used his last name when I talked to the group at
[45:12.400 --> 45:16.960]  Larry's house so I figured you know he's just got somebody else but when I went to
[45:16.960 --> 45:21.920]  the index it had Joseph patterns mature in the index I immediately went to the
[45:21.920 --> 45:25.680]  appendix the appendix and they're talked in terms of a tape recorded
[45:25.680 --> 45:29.600]  conversation and I want all your listeners to understand this on November
[45:29.600 --> 45:35.840]  the night of 1963 two weeks approximately two weeks before the
[45:35.840 --> 45:43.200]  assassination Joseph Adamus military in a tape recorded conversation that was
[45:43.200 --> 45:48.760]  done by the Miami intelligence police unit they placed a recorder in the
[45:48.760 --> 45:54.240]  Somerset's apartment and he was there informant and they tape recorded the
[45:54.240 --> 45:59.920]  conversation and in that conversation military said that we're going to kill
[45:59.920 --> 46:05.360]  him from an office building with a high par rifle and then Somerset said to
[46:05.360 --> 46:10.480]  him are you sure that he said oh yes he said I'm sure it's in the works let me
[46:10.480 --> 46:16.080]  stop you right there for just a second we're speaking with FBI agent Don Adams
[46:16.080 --> 46:21.440]  this is amazing information and in a moment we're gonna play a clip from the
[46:21.440 --> 46:29.240]  audio tape made by the intelligence bureau there in Miami Florida in fact
[46:29.240 --> 46:35.520]  let's go ahead let's go ahead now and play a clip of this tape so because
[46:35.520 --> 46:39.560]  separately you've got FBI agent Don Adams in Georgia investigating this guy
[46:39.560 --> 46:43.320]  before it happens then he learns this guy shooting his mouth off so much and
[46:43.320 --> 46:47.800]  hanging out with these grips in Miami that we now know we're planning it headed
[46:47.800 --> 46:55.080]  up of course by famous CIA black op commander E Howard Hunt who ran it
[46:55.080 --> 46:59.040]  assassinations worldwide deathbed confession talking about how it was
[46:59.040 --> 47:05.480]  planned in Miami here he is in Florida Joseph Adams Miltier saying to the
[47:05.480 --> 47:09.320]  police undercover yeah we're gonna kill him in Dallas we're gonna kill him with
[47:09.320 --> 47:13.480]  a rifle and then later the cops go back and get another interview and he's
[47:13.480 --> 47:17.120]  saying see I told you we were gonna kill him you think I was playing games boy
[47:17.120 --> 47:22.160]  let's go ahead and play that audio here it is but the most startling discovery
[47:22.160 --> 47:29.120]  was a tape recording captured by Miami intelligence officers November 9th 1963
[47:29.120 --> 47:34.480]  just weeks before Dallas Miltier is talking to the informant William
[47:34.480 --> 47:51.240]  Somerset the FBI headquarters and Secret Service both had that tape within
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.840]  days I sure they stopped the president from traveling instantly but they didn't
[47:55.840 --> 48:00.840]  and he says he was jubilant bragging to Somerset you thought I was kidding when
[48:00.840 --> 48:05.040]  I said he would be killed from a window with a high-powered rifle despite all
[48:05.040 --> 48:10.080]  of that Miltier was never even mentioned in the Warren Commission report when
[48:10.080 --> 48:15.320]  Hoover set up the propaganda in the FBI don't embarrass the FBI that was his
[48:15.320 --> 48:20.100]  rules and you didn't so they ordered everything put into the archives and to
[48:20.100 --> 48:24.440]  be forgotten about it but Don can't forget and hope something is done
[48:24.440 --> 48:28.520]  before the truth is buried forever I mean when we die off when we're gone
[48:28.520 --> 48:32.280]  there's not gonna be anybody's gonna stay here and tell you these things all
[48:32.280 --> 48:36.560]  right going back now to retired FBI agent Don Adams that must have hit you
[48:36.560 --> 48:42.280]  like a thunderbolt when all this came out that other police agencies you know
[48:42.280 --> 48:46.280]  had the guy talking about how they were gonna kill him in Dallas and then
[48:46.280 --> 48:50.200]  bragging after the fact I told you we were gonna kill him I mean this is this
[48:50.200 --> 48:55.560]  is open and shut isn't it yes it devastated me to have that type of
[48:55.560 --> 49:00.360]  positive information on a tape recording by the two people that we were
[49:00.360 --> 49:06.400]  dealing with as far as that time element is concerned and then for him to make
[49:06.400 --> 49:11.400]  that positive statement he should have been stopped the president's travel
[49:11.400 --> 49:15.320]  should have been stopped immediately and he should have not gone to Dallas well
[49:15.320 --> 49:19.280]  Don the story I mean the real issue here is and of course you've researched
[49:19.280 --> 49:22.200]  this you know about it the black secret service agent that knew that was coming
[49:22.200 --> 49:27.680]  in Chicago so they moved it from Chicago to Dallas and of course he said that
[49:27.680 --> 49:31.560]  decades ago and then documents did come out and then there's a deathbed
[49:31.560 --> 49:37.600]  confession by E Howard Hunt the famous black op head of state assassin squad
[49:37.600 --> 49:44.040]  leader it says yeah we're in Miami for the big event now BJ was you know running
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.320]  the big event and I was there and kind of on the sideline and then we were gonna
[49:48.320 --> 49:54.000]  be doing it in Chicago but then it got moved to Dallas I mean we've just got
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.960]  it all right there yeah I it's it's amazing I heard about
[49:58.960 --> 50:04.760]  a statement in that I've never listened to it personally but when you start
[50:04.760 --> 50:08.080]  tying all the all the knots together and that you're gonna come up with an
[50:08.080 --> 50:15.600]  answer and all this information that they had at their hands I got none of it I
[50:15.600 --> 50:22.360]  knew nothing about the the nice tape recording I knew nothing that no chair
[50:22.360 --> 50:30.520]  had been interviewed by my partner a year before in 1982 on a civil rights
[50:30.520 --> 50:36.100]  investigation my partner says nothing to me about it at all my and William
[50:36.100 --> 50:41.000]  Elliott worked with my partner a year before that in 82 and he said nothing
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.960]  to me and we worked together extensively every day doing a workup on
[50:44.960 --> 50:52.560]  military now why in the hell was this stuff kept from me you know when I go
[50:52.560 --> 50:58.200]  back in 93 I mean back to 93 when all this stuff started and that I was
[50:58.200 --> 51:04.120]  devastated I was totally shocked to think that my own agency the FBI had
[51:04.120 --> 51:08.560]  had covered this whole thing and delayed giving me I mean there was no proper
[51:08.560 --> 51:14.040]  investigation conducted in Dallas they named Oswald and once that was done
[51:14.040 --> 51:20.280]  everything generated on Oswald and and military was forgotten I mean and then
[51:20.280 --> 51:24.960]  they killed their patsy and Fletcher Proudie who himself was the main
[51:24.960 --> 51:30.040]  liaison between the Pentagon and CIA black ops he got literally you know sent
[51:30.040 --> 51:35.140]  away to the to the North Pole so that he wouldn't be there when all this
[51:35.140 --> 51:40.080]  happened and he explained how they use mafia they use hit men they use right
[51:40.080 --> 51:44.280]  wing veterans and they had all these different teams including more teams
[51:44.280 --> 51:48.640]  down the road if Kennedy would have escaped now they haven't just just
[51:48.640 --> 51:54.320]  multiple hit teams ready to deal with it they even had the military in the air
[51:54.320 --> 51:58.360]  above Dallas in case the public found out and things had to be suppressed they
[51:58.360 --> 52:02.200]  had the corrupt mafia controlled Dallas police department all hooked up
[52:02.200 --> 52:08.280]  heavily involved with intelligence and it's just absolutely incredible that you
[52:08.280 --> 52:13.480]  were there you tried to stop it you were on the job and then decades later they
[52:13.480 --> 52:17.800]  declassify and release the fact that this guy was talking about killing him
[52:17.800 --> 52:24.100]  and where and how and when before and after I mean this is incredible Alex
[52:24.100 --> 52:29.000]  let me mention one thing to you that's very important after we went into the
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.440]  archives in 99 or no it was later than that it was in 2003 or something like
[52:34.440 --> 52:38.520]  that we went into the archives and pulled the documents in that I found a
[52:38.520 --> 52:43.480]  document in there that said in there that they contacted that the Atlanta
[52:43.480 --> 52:48.780]  office had contacted their agent in in Thomasville and he told them that
[52:48.780 --> 52:54.160]  no tear was equipment Georgia at the time the assassination took place and that
[52:54.160 --> 52:59.400]  was an outright lie and it's a totally fraudulent document the document was
[52:59.400 --> 53:05.440]  done and the words were said but it was not it was not true and and my partner
[53:05.440 --> 53:09.200]  was the only one that was there and I left him saying I was going to find no
[53:09.200 --> 53:13.560]  tear I was gonna locate him if I could and which we did I checked him in the
[53:13.560 --> 53:19.280]  morning and at night and and here he at some time or somebody saying that he
[53:19.280 --> 53:25.200]  did it said that the military was equipment Georgia at the time of
[53:25.200 --> 53:29.920]  assassination there in that book I treason is a photograph of military
[53:29.920 --> 53:34.640]  standing there looking at the presidential limousine moments before
[53:34.640 --> 53:39.080]  the president was killed that's right I interrupted you agent Adams before you
[53:39.080 --> 53:44.840]  got to that so so so so recap you get this book you open it up and there he
[53:44.840 --> 53:49.880]  is clear as day looking at the president in the motorcade talk about that
[53:49.880 --> 53:54.320]  sure I mean I you can imagine when you investigate a person and you do a full
[53:54.320 --> 53:58.040]  background on him and I walked up to him like I said and I took all this hate
[53:58.040 --> 54:02.920]  literature from him which he was really giving out in that I spent a lot of time
[54:02.920 --> 54:08.160]  with this guy and then when I when I finally took him into custody and took
[54:08.160 --> 54:11.920]  him back for interview and everything on the 27th there was a lot of time
[54:11.920 --> 54:17.520]  together and and I know him a hundred percent and when I saw that photograph it
[54:17.520 --> 54:22.600]  hit me like a rule like you said like a stack of bricks hit me and and and it's
[54:22.600 --> 54:27.400]  just it blew my mind I couldn't believe it but here he is I because I couldn't
[54:27.400 --> 54:32.520]  locate him and then I found out afterwards that on the same morning on
[54:32.520 --> 54:37.800]  November the 22nd at 10 o'clock in the morning before he was photographed
[54:37.800 --> 54:41.440]  there on Houston Street he made a telephone call the summer said in
[54:41.440 --> 54:46.760]  Miami and told him I'm in Jack Rabbit country your friend is coming here and
[54:46.760 --> 54:51.800]  you're not going to see him again and then when I said you mentioned later on
[54:51.800 --> 54:56.560]  that that no chair was jubilant over he was when he met with summer said the
[54:56.560 --> 55:01.920]  following day after the assassination at the Jacksonville Florida River Station
[55:01.920 --> 55:06.680]  he told him he said I told I told you I wasn't kidding you thought I was
[55:06.680 --> 55:12.080]  kidding in that but but it was taken care of just like I said it would be so
[55:12.080 --> 55:16.880]  here is is this guy very heavily involved and they take everything away from
[55:16.880 --> 55:21.480]  him and bury him into the archives and concentrate everything on Oswald and
[55:21.480 --> 55:25.800]  Oswald never even fired a shot well another incredible issue is the police
[55:25.800 --> 55:32.000]  both local and federal were doing their job you are on him you've got the Florida
[55:32.000 --> 55:37.280]  Police are on him he's getting off the train from Texas obviously and he's
[55:37.280 --> 55:40.680]  saying I told you they got him two weeks before saying we're gonna kill him
[55:40.680 --> 55:45.680]  and with a high-powered rifle out of a building you know in Dallas and then he
[55:45.680 --> 55:48.720]  gets back and you know that the undercovers they're recording he's like
[55:48.720 --> 55:54.200]  I told you boy I mean you this is open and shut now now you talk about Joseph
[55:54.200 --> 55:58.040]  Adams military being a world war two sniper being a really violent no he
[55:58.040 --> 56:03.080]  wasn't one of the four was one of the four yeah see the meeting that took
[56:03.080 --> 56:08.560]  place in Indianapolis and that no tear was really the spokesman and the and
[56:08.560 --> 56:13.040]  Somerset was the informant and then the one of the other two persons I was a
[56:13.040 --> 56:16.800]  sniper in the second world war and he said that he was willing to go up into
[56:16.800 --> 56:22.280]  the tree and give his life and that to take Kennedy out amazing so so who was
[56:22.280 --> 56:25.600]  Joseph Adams military because the news reported he was a really violent guy
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.320]  well he said in a report in that book in the high trees instead he was one of
[56:30.320 --> 56:34.480]  the most violent men in the country I here's a here's another thing about it
[56:34.480 --> 56:39.840]  my partner who had investigated me a year before said nothing to me about him
[56:39.840 --> 56:44.080]  ever being armed and one of the most stringent rules that we have in the FBI
[56:44.080 --> 56:48.480]  is if you develop any information where there's a possibility of an agent
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.480]  getting harmed or hurt or killed it's mandatory that you immediately put a
[56:53.480 --> 56:58.880]  caution out on the man and and underlined it in every single communication
[56:58.880 --> 57:05.000]  that you put out and I knew nothing about him being armed after I left then
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.040]  he wrote a report in January of 64 and in that report under the synopsis he put
[57:11.040 --> 57:15.120]  in there that that no tears should be considered armed and dangerous because
[57:15.120 --> 57:21.120]  he has a 38 weapon with him and I knew nothing about that so here's my
[57:21.120 --> 57:26.960]  partner did everything he could against every proper Bureau rule to protect me
[57:26.960 --> 57:32.680]  and and the chief everybody else and they and they got rid of every bit of
[57:32.680 --> 57:36.560]  that information and gave none of it to me whatever happened to Miltier
[57:36.560 --> 57:43.240]  Miltier had an explosion of a gas stove in his house and said and then the
[57:43.240 --> 57:47.280]  early reports were that he got killed because of that but then I read some
[57:47.280 --> 57:53.120]  more reports after that which said that that he was burnt just slightly from the
[57:53.120 --> 58:00.760]  explosion of the gas the stove and that that he was fine after that he had been
[58:00.760 --> 58:04.620]  released by the hospital they said there was nothing wrong with him other than
[58:04.620 --> 58:08.920]  having a minor burns in that to be treated and he was fine and then I'm not
[58:08.920 --> 58:14.640]  sure about this but I believe it was like 74 that he he finally passed away
[58:14.640 --> 58:20.400]  that amazing we're gonna come back and do a few more minutes with you okay because
[58:20.400 --> 58:26.840]  you all show in some of the news reports I've seen sir you talk about how you

[59:51.560 --> 1:00:05.680]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:12.880]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:22.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:29.480]  here's the headline from WJW retired at the agents as Oswald didn't kill
[1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:34.400]  Kennedy they go on to say it's a lot more the conspiracy theories it's
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:38.840]  documented fact I mean this is the police surveillance recordings the
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:46.040]  informants the the feds so you got the good ground floor FBI people and police
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:50.080]  and others trying to stop this but up high they block the investigation they
[1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:54.080]  cover it up and that was my next question I had read that you had said
[1:00:54.080 --> 1:00:57.440]  that once you got into the archives decades after when they finally released
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:04.360]  the stuff that your own FBI reports had been doctored what happened my report
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.600]  doesn't exist I mean they eliminated the total report that I wrote up and my
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:15.360]  partner Royal McGraw and a supervisor by the name of Charles Harding up in
[1:01:15.360 --> 1:01:21.600]  Atlanta Georgia they wrote two reports one wrote one written by McGraw and one
[1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:28.360]  written by Charles Harding and they took the material of all the people that I
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:32.240]  contacted in the interview trying to locate Bill Tear and doing the full
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:36.400]  background on him educational eyes and where he worked and all the stuff that
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:41.360]  we had acquired that all of that was in those their reports there the only thing
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:44.480]  that was in that report that had anything to do with Donald Adams was that
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:50.400]  one sheet of paper of my interview of Bill Tear well sir isn't the evidence of
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:54.320]  the cover-up I mean just more proof I mean look at how many people that
[1:01:54.320 --> 1:01:59.040]  witnessed the shooters on the grassy knoll the green pickup truck how many
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:05.200]  of them were murdered killed a disappeared 300 I mean there's that
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:10.280]  there's been a novel written about and and discussing solely the people that
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:12.920]  were involved in the Kennedy assassination that they say that that
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:18.440]  number is over 300 people now and I just want to mention one thing that I don't
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:22.800]  want to forget to tell you is that when I saw there's a brutal film and I made
[1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:26.960]  that comment how he wasn't shot from the back he was shot from the front when he
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:31.360]  put his hands up to his throat and that the dr. Charles Crenshaw who worked in
[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:38.160]  from a room one at Dallas Parkland Hospital and that when he as soon as
[1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:42.360]  he looked at the president he said hell he's been shot in the throat he's got a
[1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:47.120]  bullet hole here and then later on they had to do a trait cut on him to open up
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:51.600]  this throat to put a tracheotomy in him but but he saw the bullet hole right
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:55.880]  away there was no exit wound in the back and they found where the bullet had
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:02:59.480]  gone through the windshield of the limousine and apparently that's slowed
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:03.440]  down the projectile so it didn't go all the way through him and it went into a
[1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:07.560]  throat net and stayed in his body yeah that was in the original medical report
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:11.920]  and then they had his brain at the National Archives and then it got
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:15.760]  disappeared disappeared right in closing sir I want to be back up in the next
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:19.160]  month for a full hour with your great breadth of knowledge we appreciate your
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:23.400]  patriotism your love of the truth and your courage knowing how many people
[1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:26.800]  they've murdered do you ever get threatened or you concern that you're
[1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:31.360]  now really going public now I'm okay some of Alex I've always said this the
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:36.000]  good Lord picked me for this assignment whatever it was I mean whatever it is
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.800]  and if he decides he's gonna call me I'm gonna go the way he wants and I don't
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:45.880]  worry about that stuff and I would imagine you really learned that when you
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:52.080]  were in Korea yes I did yeah I I saw a lot there and it was a heavy year went
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:58.400]  all the way to the Yellow River up to China and it was an experience I never
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:01.920]  forgot but it's something that taught me a great deal about life and how
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:06.060]  important life is you know who else was on the Yellow River but fighting the
[1:04:06.060 --> 1:04:13.840]  Japanese during World War two E Howard Hunt as a sniper wow wow I see I let me
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:17.560]  tell you something Alex so that you're aware of how I work in that when I get
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:21.480]  to concentrating on my work in that I don't dwell off into a lot of other
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:26.560]  people's work because you could just go in forever and not really get this
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:31.640]  story so I'm really concentrating to make the people aware of who Joseph Adam
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:36.800]  and Melteria is and and that no I agree with you because your area of the
[1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:43.280]  investigation is conclusive I mean it's amazing the website is Adams JFK.com
[1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:47.200]  and let me say bye theater in the break I look forward to setting up for a full

[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:10.000]  because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:29.920]  wow that was an incredible interview with that retired FBI agent this amazing
[1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:33.880]  Don Adams we're gonna be having him back up for a full hour coming up in a few
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:39.440]  weeks incredible information I mean they had the police they had the FBI the
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:44.280]  recordings of him saying we're gonna kill JFK and Dallas and his motorcade then
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:47.880]  he gets back days after and it tells the informant I told you we were gonna kill
[1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:53.720]  him I mean this is amazing we have the audio tape we have E Howard Hunt the
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:58.480]  former black op commander who ran assassinations worldwide on record saying
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:05.520]  they planned it in Florida in Miami I mean it just goes on and on and on how
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:13.040]  open and shut this situation is and he's shot in the throat the Dallas doctor
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:16.600]  say he had a bullet in his throat they were told to change it but they refused
[1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:21.720]  and kept a copy this is the type of incredible information going on now
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:28.440]  shifting gears at the start of the broadcast today I covered Fox News AP you
[1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:36.640]  name it survivor details massacre of 72 migrants by drug cartel in Mexico and he
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:40.600]  escaped he says Los Zetas who on record was trained by the CIA to go after the
[1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:43.280]  other drug cartels that they don't control they work for the Mexican
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:47.800]  government is robbing and extorting and trying to force the migrants mainly
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:51.000]  from Central and South America that's who they killed they don't tend to do it
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.840]  is they still kill a lot of it not as many of their Mexican citizens so it's
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:10:00.520]  a form of nationalism against Central and South American migrants and it's all
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:05.520]  part of the North American Union and just a whole house full of 72 butchered
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:09.560]  chopped up bodies and there the police are pulling up in front of mayor's houses
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:14.040]  in Mexico dragging them out murdering them in public and this is all pouring
[1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:18.720]  over and if you read Robert Pasture's own documents and his CFR plan for the
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:22.520]  North American Union that's being implemented by stealth that's the key
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:28.560]  term implementation by stealth stealth integration of Canada the US and
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:32.480]  Mexico and under this new system we don't have our liberties and freedoms
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:39.960]  they're rewriting it and judicial watch in 2006 they sued in 2007 got the BAMF
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:45.440]  Canada security prosperity partnership in a you documents and they said we've
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:49.120]  got to keep it secret the official minutes we're taken over by stealth
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:53.640]  we're going to use border crises as a pretext to merge the countries just like
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:58.120]  the banks use the derivatives crisis they created to get more power and set up
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:03.040]  a bank of the world and a new derivatives tax a new carbon tax a new
[1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:10.880]  system a new Ponzi scheme and so all of this integrates in and dovetails with
[1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:15.440]  the information that Dan Dick's covers now I knew he put this film out a few
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:20.200]  months ago more than a few months ago I had to be like six months ago and I'm
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:24.200]  so busy I didn't watch it there's so many documentary films I've interviewed
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:29.160]  before as an activist fighting tyranny in Canada at the G20 but I hadn't watched
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:32.520]  it and they sent us a copy and said we'd like you to post this for your
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:36.760]  members at prisonplanet.tv and so by the end it took us about a month to get
[1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:41.440]  around to uploading it and all that and encoding in the different formats and I
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:45.320]  started watching it it's a full-length film and I couldn't quit I mean this is
[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:50.400]  as high production quality as we have very skilled filmmakers but it's not
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:56.840]  just that it's who they got in the interviews that completely blew me away
[1:11:56.840 --> 1:12:01.280]  so we are selling United We Fall three nations two sides one union
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:07.520]  Press for Truth presents a Brian Law film with Dan Dick's and Dan Dick's
[1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:13.600]  joins us via video link from Canada Dan break down why you made this film and
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:17.560]  the incredible interviews you've got because somebody like myself and we
[1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:21.440]  have called pasture you know the head globalist that wrote up the specific
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:25.000]  North America integration plan and he wouldn't be interviewed so because
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.440]  you're not as well known you were able to get these interviews were top
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:32.720]  globalist admit we want world government I mean this is a and the
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:38.160]  interviews look like PBS or something I mean you guys are talented cinematographers
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:43.480]  talented researchers incredibly talented graphics folks and I just want to
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:49.720]  hail you and Brian Law as amazing researchers and filmmakers well thank
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:53.800]  you very much Alex that means a lot to me coming from you I really appreciate
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:59.840]  that thanks no no listen I mean it's no brag just fact as John Wayne would say
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:05.440]  break down why you made the film and what's in it sure yeah it was about two
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:12.080]  years ago Brian and I set out to make this film which basically documents this
[1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:16.960]  push towards a North American Union this concept of Canada the US and Mexico
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:22.120]  coming together into a union very similar to this European Union we tracked
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:27.720]  it somewhat chronologically going through the various trade deals throughout
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:32.800]  time starting back as far as the general agreement on trade and tariffs from
[1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:36.920]  there we move on to the free trade agreement then we get of course into
[1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:40.640]  the North American free trade agreement and then after that we touch on the
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:44.920]  security and prosperity partnership and the North American leaders summit and
[1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:49.920]  we show how these are all incremental steps which are pushing us towards this
[1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:54.600]  idea of a North American Union and also how the North American Union in and in
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:59.560]  itself is another big step towards the even bigger picture of a global
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:04.080]  governing body so that's what we set out to do nearly two years ago now the film
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:08.520]  is two years in the making and we just released it on Canada Day actually a
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:15.240]  few months ago and yes seems to be going well well again my film in games
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:18.440]  almost three hours long it covers the full spectrum of global government
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:26.360]  spends about 35 minutes on the NAU your film in a riveting you know nonstop way
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:30.360]  in their own words you've got them admitting it it's not just Alex Jones
[1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:34.760]  showing documents and voicing it and saying look what they said you've
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:39.400]  actually got these people admitting it and this is treason this is a private
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:43.640]  corporate takeover of our governing system it's giving corporations the
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:47.400]  power just like we see BP you know being above the states and the federal
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:52.400]  government the Gulf this is global corporate governance break down some of
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:57.280]  the people you got interviews with sure yeah we really wanted to get this right
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:01.600]  from the horse's mouth so we contacted a lot of the major players who are
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:06.000]  involved with the push towards this thing members of the Bilderberg group the
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.680]  Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission and of course the
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:13.880]  Canadian Council of Chief Executives some of these people for instance are
[1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:18.000]  Alan Gottlieb he is a member of the Bilderberg group and the Trilateral
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.840]  Commission he was a former ambassador of Canadian ambassador to the states from
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:28.920]  81 to 89 so these are top-level guys we got Robert Pastor as well to speak to
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:33.680]  us John Manley who is now the president of the Canadian Council of Chief
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:38.920]  Executives and we also spoke with Herbert Grubel who is considered the
[1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:44.800]  founder of or the father of the Amaro so we really did get the opinion of these
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:50.520]  guys from the horse's mouth setting up these interviews we would basically you
[1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:55.160]  know these guys have big egos Alex and we would basically massage their egos we
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:16:00.400]  would say you know I I've read your documents I've read your books I'm very
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:04.240]  interested to get your opinion on deeper integration between the three
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:08.640]  countries we would never use words like North American Union because we knew
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:13.200]  that might scare them off from wanting to talk to us and we also knew that they
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:17.840]  would be doing background checks on us so we did keep my name out of the
[1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:22.320]  emails because they would have found my website my YouTube channel I already made
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:26.360]  a film called the nation's deathbed on a similar topic so we purposely left my
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:30.120]  name out of the emails that way we wouldn't you know tip them off as to the
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:33.720]  angle that we wanted to cover well this is a major coup and and because it's
[1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:37.080]  their admitting global government they're admitting their plan and you talk
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:43.080]  about this you know head of this corporate body in Canada and when you
[1:16:43.080 --> 1:16:47.720]  read the SPP North American Union documents or the EU documents it states
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:52.440]  that they give the power to these private corporate bodies when you read the
[1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:58.080]  hundreds of pages of SPP documents that judicial watch God it's the heads of the
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:03.360]  top US corporations about 45 or so the heads of the biggest Canadian
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:07.920]  corporations and the heads of the major Mexican corporations the real owners
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:13.440]  and they're there agreeing on the policy and then saying we must do this by
[1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:18.080]  stealth we must have a carbon tax we'll use a flu crisis to merge the
[1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:22.360]  countries we'll use an immigrant crisis to merge the countries we'll play
[1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:27.180]  groups off against each other it's still secret what Bush signed with with
[1:17:27.180 --> 1:17:35.440]  Vicente Fox in in in Texas two years before that at Baylor and so we have
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:39.800]  our presidents in open treason going under total corporate
[1:17:39.800 --> 1:17:44.760]  governorship and now here we are with the North American Union they did have a
[1:17:44.760 --> 1:17:48.560]  press conference in 2007 on the White House lawn this is in in game with
[1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:52.720]  Merkel Barroso and Bush saying we're now merging the North American Union with
[1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:58.720]  the American integration they don't call it Union using code words and so so so
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:02.200]  that integrations already happening and now they've bankrupted the economy as
[1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:06.760]  we said they would having their own IMF World Bank documents 2002 BBC they are
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:10.840]  now merging this entire system and coming out with the new Bank of the World
[1:18:10.840 --> 1:18:17.120]  naming their new global SDR currency the Baincore and it's all now coming out in
[1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:22.000]  the open but they still try to deny it on the nightly news to the general public
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:27.080]  they'll come out and admit it but then still deny it it's crazy yeah absolutely
[1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:33.520]  I mean I confronted Paul Martin about signing the SPP in 2005 I questioned him
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:38.920]  on his Bilderberg attendance I asked him why he signed the SPP when there was no
[1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:43.480]  kind of referendum on it and he basically shrugged it off as conspiracy
[1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:48.040]  theory he made a joke about being in the Bilderberg group so yes in the public
[1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:51.520]  guy these guys often just shrug it off as conspiracy theory you'll see in the
[1:18:51.520 --> 1:18:56.240]  film Herbert Grubel says you know I would put this concept into the same
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:03.400]  category as people who believe that Elvis Presley is still alive so it's
[1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:07.640]  almost a bit of a double-speak going on because at one moment they will call it
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:11.480]  conspiracy theory and then the very next moment they openly talk about this is
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:16.800]  exactly what we are doing well that's right and you bring up that that central
[1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:20.440]  point that made international news when at a press conference to the Prime
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:27.880]  Minister you know to the Canadian leader you said hey you know you signed the
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:33.040]  North American Union agreement the SPP secretly in Texas and he just said oh
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:37.920]  that doesn't exist haha when it's on record he did it and then separately the
[1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:42.840]  CFR written by Robert Pasteur puts out a document that Congress then tries to
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:48.640]  pass a so-called immigration reform that is the North American ID card and now
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:54.280]  they're offering hemispheric travel IDs in Mexico in the US and in Canada that
[1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:58.480]  are globally standardized let's talk more about the amazing documentary film

[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:41.480]  corrupt offshore group of banks that have taken over the planet's finances

[1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:17.800]  going back to Dan Dix this is a short segment long segment coming up but I
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:21.040]  mean from their own documents from interviewing and from what you cover
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:24.640]  in the film people go well it's part of the old Star Trek that we're gonna have
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:30.080]  one government they've kind of preconditioned us with with these
[1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:35.760]  fables self-fulfilling prophecies predictive programming that this is a
[1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:39.800]  foregone conclusion but this isn't a happy love the utopian world government
[1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:45.360]  this is a global corporate dictatorship that wants eugenics as their endgame
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:50.680]  yeah well Alex one of my favorite scenes in the film is when we ask Robert
[1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:55.440]  pastor his opinion on the idea that this North American Union could be leading
[1:26:55.440 --> 1:27:00.360]  towards a global governing body and he looks at us and says you mean one world
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:04.920]  government and we say yeah yeah what do you think about that and just to watch
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:10.760]  him sit there and and just stare at the camera and blink and you could see the
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:14.200]  thought just going through his head he had to choose his words very very
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:17.760]  carefully he didn't really know how to answer the question and like a
[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:21.720]  professional politician he eventually kind of answered the question without
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:26.200]  actually answering the question as they often do but you could see that he was
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:31.360]  you know stuck there at the time I was operating the B camera and I just you
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:34.800]  know I couldn't help but have a smile on my face I was like wow this says a lot
[1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:38.160]  about this guy right now yeah what did you do he paused for about four or five
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:43.480]  seconds and was blanking literally like a deer in the headlights he was literally
[1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:47.160]  like a deer in the headlights see I think he was a little bit shocked that we
[1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:51.880]  would ask him such a question on camera and I think it was a little bit more than
[1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:57.120]  four or five seconds he sat there and just did not know what to say and you
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:01.480]  know that's one of my favorite scenes in the film well I mean as I was saying
[1:28:01.480 --> 1:28:05.440]  you've knocked it out of the park you got interviews with the Sente Fox I mean
[1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:09.800]  where he admitted its world government then he went on Larry King live and said
[1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:13.240]  yes it is going to lead to a one-world government it is going to lead to a
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:17.000]  North American Union and and you did get some of the globalists to admit in the
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:22.280]  film that they do want world government yeah some of them were open about
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:28.200]  speaking about it they wouldn't use those terms but they would certainly say
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:34.960]  that you know unity is what we need like for instance Paul Martin now well we
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:39.280]  asked them all about their their concept of sovereignty as well and each each one
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:43.920]  of them said that you know sovereignty has to you know we have to rethink the
[1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:49.800]  concept of sovereignty John Manley sat there and said I find it amusing people
[1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:54.760]  who put sovereignty in this crystal jar as if it's the be-all and end-all so
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:58.840]  they kind of laugh off the concept of sovereignty and Robert Pasteur even went
[1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:04.280]  as far to say that people like myself and you are the problem we are slowing
[1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:11.080]  down progress and that we are in fear of change which of course is not the case
[1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:16.640]  whatsoever no no they have a stealth secretive forced global government that
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:21.240]  it's open goal is to quote it destroy industrialized society that's Club of

[1:33:13.160 --> 1:33:20.160]  the GCN radio network you'll notice that when I start talking about the North
[1:33:20.160 --> 1:33:26.240]  American Union I start talking faster and faster I start stammering it's one of
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:32.120]  the few subjects that at just a primitive level I get angry about because
[1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:38.000]  I've read the UN documents the CFR documents watch the C-SPAN press
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:44.060]  conferences where they admitted all you know read their reports read all the
[1:33:44.060 --> 1:33:48.680]  stuff that judicial watch sued to get the fact that they could keep it secret
[1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:53.600]  treaties they've signed and then we get the treaties and it says in the first
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:57.680]  line of the meeting we've got to keep this secret we've got to have
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:34:03.640]  integration by stealth and to know this is their plan and then some of them don't
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:06.720]  care like Vicente Fox he's like yes we're integrating North American Union and
[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:10.600]  and other globalists admit it and then to have him go on the news and make fun
[1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:14.880]  of us even make fun of Lou Dobbs ran him out of his highly rated job his house
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:23.240]  got shot up because he's reporting the truth and to read in the SPP where they
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:31.480]  said we'll use crises economic flu biological you know huge flows of
[1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:35.840]  migrants to know the UN on record the last 30 years ran the indigenous
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:39.280]  populations off their land all over central and South America but also in
[1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:44.640]  Mexico forcing them up here then using them as a weapon to drive down wages the
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:50.080]  giant sucking sound that Ross Perot talked about this is treason Obama
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:54.120]  becoming the first head of the UN Security Council as a sitting president
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:59.520]  it's treason let me read you the subsection article one section nine of
[1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:02.760]  the US Constitution by sitting himself with the head of the United Nations
[1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:05.880]  Security Council less becoming the first US president chair of the world body and
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:10.000]  when he was there they had Kissinger and all these other globalist George
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:15.440]  salts and Obama was thanking them and they were in rapture at the precedent
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:19.360]  they were setting see they're building a global government where they write the
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:24.120]  rules where they're immune from taxes regulations but they write the
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:28.400]  regulations on you and your government takes that money and pays it to them
[1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:34.840]  that's why when I saw the new film trying to find it here in my stack United
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:40.160]  we fall just a few weeks ago before we posted it on prison planet TV I was like
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:45.200]  everybody has got to see this film now let me ask you Dan and and if you're not
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:48.360]  for it that's fine I should have asked you off air but I'll just ask it here on
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:52.040]  there you may have to ask your your partner I know you gave it to us to post
[1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:57.160]  on prison planet TV graciously because you wanted our members to see it where
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:01.600]  do you guys stand on people not selling it because you need to keep your copyright
[1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:04.600]  we've discovered that ourselves because you just say do whatever you want people
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:07.960]  then try to take it away from you but where do you stand on viewing parties
[1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:11.760]  are people making copies to give their friends and family where do you stand on
[1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:18.160]  that because United we fall needs to be a big hit we absolutely fully encourage
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:23.760]  that Alex we would in fact ask people to do just that burn copies of it in high
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:27.960]  quality and give them out to your friends family members total strangers
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:31.960]  and that is absolutely key to getting this information out there because
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:37.840]  awareness is key at this time so when you do get the DVD you not only get the
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:43.360]  film but we went all out on this DVD Alex we have over two hours of extras we
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:47.160]  have deleted scenes we have a lot of special features stuff we just simply
[1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:52.040]  couldn't put in the film a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff we have a behind
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:56.200]  the music feature at I wrote and played all the music and all the sounds that
[1:36:56.200 --> 1:37:01.160]  you hear in the film so we made a Brian made a little special feature on that we
[1:37:01.160 --> 1:37:07.360]  also did a director producer commentary so when you get the DVD you you also get
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:11.440]  a lot of extra stuff and then of course we fully fully encourage people to make
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:15.600]  copies hand them out for free because getting this information out there is
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:20.640]  absolutely key at this point well that's the mark of a true patriot and we just
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:25.440]  salute you and your multi-talented gifts that you have bringing together this
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:31.440]  film United we fall three nations two sides one union a first-rate bombshell

[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:56.640]  the radio and TV viewers today Dan but I also have time to get to some calls but
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:03.000]  briefly you also in the film have the video in full living color of citizens
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:07.360]  catching police provocaturing and since then they've been caught in other
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:12.240]  cities in the US and in Europe red-handed another form of false flag
[1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:17.760]  terror to frame people that try to protest so they have a pretext to then
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:23.040]  snatch and grab citizens and bring in private contractors like we saw at the
[1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:28.320]  g20 a few months ago in Toronto absolutely Alex this is becoming their
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:34.480]  modus operandi when they want to shut down a legitimate protest a lot of the
[1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:39.360]  times they will provide the excuse to do so and just like we saw in Montebello
[1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:46.040]  of Quebec back in 2007 I was there and we documented in my previous film the
[1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:51.080]  nation's death bed where you do see three undercover police officers who were
[1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:55.360]  dressed looking kind of like the black block you know wearing the black wearing
[1:38:55.360 --> 1:39:00.040]  the bandanas and they had rocks in their hands in an attempt to incite violence
[1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:07.200]  the Quebec police did in fact admit to it and said yes these are our officers
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:12.080]  and they're simply performing their duties so they are admitting that this
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:19.000]  is a common tactic that they are using so now just recently with the g8 and the
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:25.080]  g20 coming to Toronto there are a lot of very very very questionable things that
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:30.400]  happen there and we are actually working on a new film about the police and about
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:35.240]  what took place here in Toronto we are doing a lot of interviews we have
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:39.320]  captured a lot of footage from that event and we want to get to the bottom of
[1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:44.320]  what happened here because it was absolute travesty I'm sure a lot of
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:48.080]  people may have seen some YouTube videos or seen clips on the news of what
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:52.240]  happened here so we are currently working very hard on a new film to get
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:56.600]  that information out there as well and notice it was the same thing that we saw
[1:39:56.600 --> 1:40:01.320]  in Pittsburgh people in police uniforms people in military uniforms people in
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:05.680]  plain clothes pulling up grabbing citizens for no reason throwing them in
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:10.240]  unmarked cars same thing happened in Toronto this is a global management and
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:13.640]  they always do it in front of news cameras to send the message hey we
[1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:18.280]  snatched and grab and they snatched and grabbed Rob do and took him to a
[1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:22.320]  military facility where hundreds of other people were getting off trucks with
[1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:28.240]  bags on their heads like they were Al Qaeda yeah absolutely it's going on all
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:32.640]  over the place of course as you know Charlie Beach was here in Toronto
[1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:37.200]  helping me cover it and they snatched him up right away he you know his first
[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:42.800]  day here he ended up spending 21 hours in the holding facility and just went
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:49.040]  through a horrendous ordeal there and there's certainly an attack on this
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:53.640]  information because they know it is key they know we are having an effect and
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:57.720]  they're trying to shut it down at at every step of the way and he was out
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:03.360]  there being absurd you know saying all sorts of absurd things and saying yes
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:07.880]  I'm a secret police officer with the love police and last time I heard they
[1:41:07.880 --> 1:41:12.720]  charged him with impersonating an officer when it's clearly a joke where has
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:19.440]  that gone well there was a court case just a few days ago we went down to
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:23.760]  cover it there was about 300 people who had to show up at court on the same day
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:30.680]  to face their charges I believe in Charlie's case the the Public's Work
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:35.640]  Protection Act failing to show ID charge has been dropped but they are not
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:41.400]  gonna drop the impersonating a police officer charge so his lawyer here in
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:45.480]  Canada is going to have to be fighting that for him and it's just ridiculous
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:49.800]  anybody who sees the footage if you watch the videos you will see he is very
[1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:55.320]  very clearly joking that's all part of Charlie's style of activism is bringing
[1:41:55.320 --> 1:42:00.440]  humor to this movement by the way they arrested him for not giving him the ID
[1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:06.120]  then they released him and they later charged him basically in absentia when
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:10.960]  he went back to England yeah well basically they saw our video that we
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:16.520]  posted to my youtube channel youtube.com backslash weaving spider and they
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:21.400]  saw that there and said aha we got him we can we can now get him again and try
[1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:27.360]  to stifle his efforts so he's obviously gonna be a big part of our new film
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:32.120]  because he spent the whole weekend with us there so yeah we're gonna we're gonna
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:35.960]  work hard to bring that to people amazing let's play the trailer and then go
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:40.640]  right to calls here is the trailer for the amazing film United We Fall
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:47.520]  available at prisonplanet.tv and on dvd at infowars.com here it is
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:56.120]  our economies now are very integrated our societies are growing increasingly
[1:42:56.120 --> 1:43:02.560]  integrated what's needed now is a North American idea for all three an idea that
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:08.240]  not only defines our shared history but a shared destiny
[1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:16.080]  it is the merger of the United States Mexico and Canada into one super
[1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:22.000]  country I had the idea the inspiration to call it the Amaro the Amaro is the
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:25.760]  proposed new currency for the North American community that sounds an
[1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:28.120]  awful lot like the North American Union to me
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:35.440]  Canadians are saying no to the North American Union and yes to Canada's sovereignty
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:40.200]  I find it amusing when people put sovereignty is in a kind of crystal jar
[1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:44.360]  and say well this is the ultimate Canadians Americans and Mexicans will
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:49.120]  lose their sovereignty Europeans have thrown sovereignty out the window
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:53.440]  maybe national sovereignty is not such a good thing to understand what's
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:57.040]  happening we should look at what has occurred under the security and
[1:43:57.040 --> 1:44:00.280]  prosperity partnership
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:06.360]  it was implemented in a matter that closed it off to public scrutiny and the
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:11.280]  only people were invited into the room were the largest CEOs of the largest
[1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:16.000]  businesses in three countries our country's been defined and shaped by
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:20.080]  corporations it's not gonna stop with the North American Union it's going to be
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:25.800]  one further step along the road to one world government we need a world of
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:33.840]  shared global rules founded on shared global values it is a big idea a new
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:40.200]  world order new world order one world government one world government
[1:44:42.080 --> 1:44:47.880]  right now there's a war on for your mind we are losing our nation before our
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:52.560]  very eyes people are slowly beginning to to wake up to the fact that the fourth
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:59.000]  state has simply not done their job the people will resist the people will stand
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:04.600]  up against them and not tolerate their power grab for the whole world also
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:10.680]  takes for enough people to step out of the system to cause a crash it is just
[1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:15.320]  a conspiracy theory who cares if they call you conspiracy theorists the truth

[1:46:55.360 --> 1:46:59.000]  Tarheel State when they start taking guns away I think we'll probably be the
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:03.760]  last one standing after Texas hey look I got a question for you it's a two-fold
[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:09.040]  question all right go ahead what is okay look what what is I mean if these guys
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:11.560]  are already running the show you know the builder burgers and these guys and I
[1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:14.280]  believe they are I'm with you on it but this is a question I get asked a lot
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:18.120]  what is the advantage really if they're already in charge they're already in
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:21.680]  control they're already wealthy beyond belief what's the advantage to them
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:25.920]  really to collapsing society and that's the part one it wouldn't it really be
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:29.960]  better to run a more a successful society I mean if they collapses where's
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:34.160]  the innovation where's the technology that we have now let me answer that let
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:38.640]  me answer that question okay you have to look at what they are doing we have the
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:44.200]  IMF World Bank documents we have the Goldman Sachs emails and documents it's
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:49.920]  not just Alex Jones it's McClatchy News Service five-part series with Mr. Gordon
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:55.320]  they are doing it because they have incredible money in power they are
[1:47:55.320 --> 1:48:00.560]  dominating the globe they don't have full control and they're selfish they
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:04.360]  want to control the life extension technologies that are developing they
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:07.760]  don't want to give it to seven or eight or nine billion people they believe it's
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:11.840]  gonna plane out at nine billion they want you out of the way they think you're
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:17.920]  profane and ugly and and stunted and and they describe you as bugs and as
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:23.120]  useless eaters listen to Ted Turner listen to Jacques Cousteau saying we've
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:27.560]  got to kill millions of people listen to Prince Philip saying you're scum he
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:33.240]  wants to kill 80% of you Dr. Eric Pionka they believe the world is theirs it's
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:38.360]  called social Darwinism and they believe that if they can kill you it's their
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:44.120]  right to do it because survival of the fittest this is their stated plan they
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:48.120]  want a world government they don't have it yet they've got the banks most the
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:51.360]  money they're trying to get control they're trying to put the surveillance
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:55.520]  grids in they're trying to break up the family I've got their own textbooks where
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:49:00.120]  they say the family's a disease they want to remake man as a biological
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:05.160]  suboid android that serves them have you read brave new world he wrote brave new
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:09.920]  world revisited 30 plus years later he was from a top British eugenics family
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:14.280]  and he said this is what we really are going to do read the book written in
[1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:20.280]  32 today and it's everything that's in the news they're not playing games

[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:28.640]  stop making money off of us they print the stinking money they issue the
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:33.720]  currency they control the paradigm they don't want us here you understand that
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:38.360]  and they and if every FBI agent every cop every teacher every bureaucrat
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:42.960]  everybody that makes up this system you are in the crosshairs just like I am

[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:12.360]  hear that a lot people just can't seem to believe that that they would want to

[1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:16.200]  be able to answer this people say well why would the globalist want to destroy
[1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:21.520]  the economy why would they want to wreck things why would they be because
[1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:25.080]  they're imaging the world according to their individual view they're not a bad
[1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:29.120]  person that wants to wreck things so they don't understand this order out of
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:32.640]  chaos you've got to destroy something before you build something on its ashes
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:40.160]  your comments on that absolutely that's how they achieve anything that they get
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:45.240]  is this concept of order out of chaos they know if they can create enough
[1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:50.240]  problems then out of the ashes of that will emerge their solution which is
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:55.520]  always a more of a push toward global government so they've been utilizing this
[1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:59.240]  technique for many many years I mean a lot of people say the same thing to me
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:02.680]  they say why would you know why would anybody even want a North American
[1:55:02.680 --> 1:55:05.760]  Union nobody around here is going to go for it nobody in the space is going to
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:10.400]  go for it and yeah of course at this point in time yes nobody around here
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:15.040]  wants a North American Union but that could all change in in a day and
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:20.520]  tomorrow people's opinions can easily be manipulated they often use sometimes
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:25.760]  you know black ops like off-leg operations it could be you know it
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:30.400]  could be an economic crisis that could be a health crisis yeah they always give
[1:55:30.400 --> 1:55:34.640]  solutions that only make it worse but sell it to people that are ignorant as
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:40.280]  the solution absolutely in the solution they had right from the get-go and this
[1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:47.200]  is how they get their control is by manipulating the population with this
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:53.000]  concept of order out of chaos or you know the hig alien dialectic or it's
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:57.480]  more commonly referred to as problem reaction solution and that's how they
[1:55:57.480 --> 1:56:00.920]  that's how they pull this stuff off let's take a call Stephanie in Texas
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:06.400]  you're on the air with Dan Dix hi Dan hi Alex thank you guys so much for the
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:11.640]  work you do I applaud your efforts to wake up this world a friend of mine just
[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:15.760]  got in her renewal passport yesterday and I compared it with her previous one
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:19.320]  and I noticed two things I'd like to comment on and then ask a question I
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:24.160]  noticed that there is a chip in there as well and it also now this year compared
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:29.160]  to the last last passport she had it noticed the verbiage of don't bend it's
[1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:35.440]  got an electromagnetic band in it and no longer does it say that this is our
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:41.120]  passport it's now the property of the United States that gives me many angst
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:44.920]  for many reasons as you can imagine saying you're right to travel or leave
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:51.200]  or come into the country as a citizen is their property correct and so now then
[1:56:51.200 --> 1:56:54.960]  the previous one did not have that on there so even though we're asked to pay
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:59.240]  for these passports they're not really our property so if you're traveling
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:04.840]  overseas and have identified you as the good guy well what did what did the North
[1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:09.840]  American Union travel ID that they're issuing to travel in Mexico or Canada I
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:16.680]  mean that's a hemispheric travel ID initiative sorry go ahead oh so my
[1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:21.520]  question is is since they can take this back because it's not really ours is there
[1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:27.200]  any other form of identification or ID that you know we could come up with that
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:31.400]  we could actually say this is ours it's not yours and that way if you're over
[1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:37.880]  traveling abroad you know you can have some type of ID that's really yours well
[1:57:37.880 --> 1:57:44.760]  again any type tyranny doesn't want its slaves to be able to get out and so you
[1:57:44.760 --> 1:57:47.960]  can go and I guess get a foreign passport in some cases but it's very
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:51.760]  serious let's get a comment from Dan Dix about that I appreciate your call
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:57.640]  Stephanie yeah absolutely the the you know what's going on in the airports and
[1:57:57.640 --> 1:58:02.240]  with the passports is getting worse and worse with this North American Union
[1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:07.160]  idea you know John Manley was the part of this nexus program where they are
[1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:12.000]  using your biometrics in order to identify yourself so you can get through
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:17.120]  the lines quicker faster they say you know if you just scan your eye it'll be
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:22.640]  much easier for you they always play these things off as being 40 or 50 but
[1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:28.880]  certainly travel is is changing you know in this post 9-eleven world that's for
[1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:33.560]  sure absolutely Dan stay there we've got a big announcement on the other side

[2:00:46.840 --> 2:01:16.680]  suicide other type drugs like that it turns out Lindsay Lohan was reportedly on Adderall a form of speed a another serotonin reuptake inhibitor a whole bunch of drugs and a bunch of top doctors that interviewed her and did test on her said that she was misdiagnosed and these drugs are probably what's making her act crazy but see that's what's perfect for the system is that they put out drugs that cause people to have breakdowns and their answers more drugs and so we
[2:01:16.680 --> 2:01:43.920]  have a chance to get people that normally don't care about politics and health issues to watch a 11 minute video that I produced that Rob do edited and put together a great job that we just released a few hours ago it's on info wars dot com and present planet dot com and the headline is Lindsay Lohan poisoned along with 300 million other Americans and it gets into the prescription drugs it gets into the

[2:09:49.120 --> 2:10:05.120]  no it's 12 fold increase in in children that's right four fold increase in the studies in adults of cancers deformities you name it they know in their own army studies what it did before they decided to use it they don't care about the cops the troops the
[2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:20.120]  citizens and you bet they engineered 9 11 this global corporate crime syndicate all the evidence is clear and I've been saying it before 9 11 and since then the Gulf of Tonkin is now declassified to be staged operation Ajax I had a high level
[2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:38.120]  CIA top analyst retired on last week and make Michael saying the evidence shows inside job I've had countless other engineers and architects and historians and researchers and six of the 10 9 11 commissioners and so it's the same thing if they don't care about the
[2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:50.120]  tens of thousands of rescue workers dead and dying over 3000 dead now if they don't care about the tens of thousands of cleanup crews and lie to them and say you're fine the EPA says you're fine Obama says you're fine then we have the footage of
[2:10:50.120 --> 2:11:09.120]  7 being blown up the police saying get back they say they're blowing it up the newscast where they said it and they tried to ignore this but there's a new TV ad and they got some great funding from great patriots that's going to run around the country this weekend it's going to premiere here in just a few minutes and it's such important information
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:25.120]  now a mani bedello of course lost his uncle in the world trade centers Bob McElvane lost his son and they've both been outspoken patriots really shattering the live that is the official 9 11 fable that's been used to butcher the bill of rights and
[2:11:25.120 --> 2:11:45.120]  constitution to sell secret arrest and torture to sell illegal wars to sell the naked body scanners to sell this conversion from land of the free home of the brave to land of the slaves and brainwash minions so we now go to many bedello and Bob McElvane joining us and I'm glad they contacted me to
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:57.120]  to premiere this here today gentlemen good to have you on thank you very much hour who wants to speak first about this ad why it's important and then we're going to premiere it
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:22.120]  go ahead many thanks Bob okay Alex this is a breaking we're going to compete with the big boys now for the past year in New York there's been the building what campaign and essentially that started from last year during NYC cans petition drive where we collected 80,000 signatures we've made it all the way to the
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:38.120]  state Supreme Court and in the argument that the state Supreme Court of course the city was trying to fight against us the city law office came out and said it's not a proper subject to be placed in front of voters I mean that's shocking enough but in the courtroom when the arguments were going back
[2:12:38.120 --> 2:12:56.120]  and forth between our lawyer Dennis McMahon and the city's lawyer and then judge Lerner Dennis McMahon answered one of the judges questions said why do we need a new investigation Dennis McMahon our lawyer said well you know what we have never had a real
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:13:10.120]  investigation because the nine of them commission did not answer the majority of families question and there's some outstanding questions such as what happened to building seven well judge Lerner replied in the courtroom and this is you could you could read this he
[2:13:10.120 --> 2:13:32.120]  replied building what and ultimately that shows that even a New York City judge had no idea about building seven and this is the pivotal point in the entire event that took my uncle's life this film this video we have and there's multiple videos of
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:47.120]  building seven coming down if that's shown to the world then people are going to become skeptical they're going to start critically thinking about the event. Yeah building seven is the key and again we're talking to Manny Badillo I get all wound up running for years great
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:14:02.120]  Manny Badillo and Bob McElvane this is so important because for those that don't know why don't you recap building seven imagine a 47 story building would have collapsed on its own that day everybody would know its name but the media doesn't
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:18.120]  like to talk about it because it's way down the street wasn't hit by a plane BBC reported oh it's already fallen in its own footprint they had later admitted Reuters have given them the script CNN reported it and we have multiple mainstream live feeds
[2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:34.120]  CNN and others saying get back they decided to bring it down then we have the owner saying we made the decision to pull the building gave the order watch it come down pull it means control demolition in that nomenclature you know just like a touchdown
[2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:52.120]  is called a TD and football speak about that we have eyewitnesses Craig Bartmer who heard the explosion NYPD we have Kevin Mcpaddon who heard the countdown for the building with building seven we we are change every Saturday stands on the ground
[2:14:52.120 --> 2:15:07.120]  where building seven the old building seven used to stand there's already a new building there okay they already have built a new building seven and yet there's still no proper family memorial there's a retail store up the block that sells memorabilia
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:20.120]  but there's still no proper memorial yet the majority of Americans do not know about the Solomon brothers building that was the name of the building do not know that it was part of the World Trade Center complex because it was north of the complex
[2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:32.120]  and it came down at nearly freefall speed directly in some footprint nobody was allowed to go near at the investigation team wasn't even allowed to go near it was the first building that was cleaned up and was cleaned up within weeks
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:44.120]  and it's where the CIA and FBI and everybody else was based and the city state and county command center let's get Bob McElvain who lost his sons take on this
[2:15:44.120 --> 2:16:02.120]  well Alex I you know I many and Ted Walters they've been doing so much work on this and I personally since this all began and you know in any period I don't know you know when you want to close the child but my whole investigation of course is what happened that day
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:16.120]  and I personally feel that you know the United States orchestrated this whole event but what's so important about building seven I think the other two buildings have to be talked about also because my son didn't work at the tower he was
[2:16:16.120 --> 2:16:35.120]  especially up to 106th floor anyway I've spent years investigating and every parent wants to know get your child go through any pain and I finally was able to sit down with the doctor who found his body his or looked at his body
[2:16:35.120 --> 2:16:52.120]  and he was brought into the you know the morgue that day so you know it took me years to finally find a doctor but why I'm so connected to building seven and the other buildings is I've found out my son walked into the
[2:16:52.120 --> 2:17:07.120]  the lobby of tower one could have been before the plane hit or right at the plane but he died instantly and it was like a big shotgun blast to him and to the chest and the face and there was no and there were
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:22.120]  and people skeptics will say well it was because the fire came down the lobby and it blew out but he had hit post mortem burn so there was a huge explosion in the lobby it wasn't caused by fire so he died from an explosion and we hear about the
[2:17:22.120 --> 2:17:38.120]  explosions going on in tower seven the explosions in the south tower the explosions in the north tower of course the commission never spoke of that and we've got firemen and police and janitors and witnesses about boom boom bombs going off everywhere
[2:17:38.120 --> 2:17:53.120]  correct and I can prove beyond a reasonable this is how my son died so he was murdered and it wasn't because of the plane come hitting this north he was walking into the north tower it wasn't because of fire it wasn't because the building came down because he would have called me
[2:17:53.120 --> 2:18:08.120]  he died instantly he might have died right before the plane hit or right after the plane hit because all his injuries were to his face and chest so he didn't know what hit him he didn't run if the plane would have hit he would have run so he definitely died from an explosion so this is why it's so important to me because
[2:18:08.120 --> 2:18:28.120]  I went closer on how my son was killed or murdered and I've been lied to since two thousand September 11th 2001 when they had the story orchestrated for us and this is what I'll say so this is why the building's seven but the other two buildings are very important because it's these explosions
[2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:42.120]  where did these explosions come from where they did come from the fire specifically in the south tower how the plane hit the corner of the building most of the explosions outside and that tower comes down before the north tower when that's impossible
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:56.120]  well we also have the firemen on video saying the fires were almost out in the north and south tower but that there was like molten lava like a foundry like a volcano and jet fuel can't do that it can weaken steel but it can't turn it into lava
[2:18:56.120 --> 2:19:10.120]  it's impossible I mean we're talking about impossibility and then of course tower seven it wasn't hit so all these things and it's just you know finally we're hopefully getting somewhere that people in New York City and it's important people in New York City
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:17.120]  that these things were impossible that they could possibly happen like they did so it's
[2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:30.120]  what do you think of Glenn Beck saying he hates the victims families and that they're I really I didn't want to talk about going back I don't want to talk about anybody and he's an idiot he's there to make money he's a clown
[2:19:30.120 --> 2:19:40.120]  well my point is he's going there to stand at ground zero like he's a hero but we have all these tapes of him saying there's no one he hates more than the 9-11 victims I don't know why he's
[2:19:40.120 --> 2:19:49.120]  I put it to him I put it to anyone I wish he could say that in front of my face come to my door and say that then see what kind of cuts he has to do
[2:19:49.120 --> 2:20:01.120]  I just thought I'd bring up that sickening hypocrisy and they won't give the heroes medical care they just want to wrap themselves in the American flag and their heroism stay there sir
[2:20:01.120 --> 2:20:14.120]  when you hear the words water purification what comes to mind if it's Berkey water purification systems this message is for you did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride had less than 2 cents per gallon

[2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:13.120]  the question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights
[2:21:13.120 --> 2:21:26.120]  not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land they think they own our water children our education our money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate

[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:33.120]  911 victims families always whining complaining and then I saw New York Post saying oh it's ambulance chasers that want medical care when all the hospitals say they're dead and dying and full of asbestos I mean they're now going to do that to the people with the
[2:24:33.120 --> 2:24:52.120]  core exit but that's another issue we need to explain the attacks or they'll keep using the attacks to get more power and they may stage more attacks so I want to play and premiere this TV ad for the first time here for everybody here is the new ad that's going to be airing around the country
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:25:05.120]  I lost my son my nephew my uncle my son on September 11th 2001 most people don't know that a third tower fell on September 11th World Trade Center 747 story skyscraper was not hit by a plane
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:17.120]  although the official explanation is that fire brought down building 7 over 1200 architects and engineers have looked into the evidence and believe there is more to the story bring justice to my son my uncle my nephew my son
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:23.120]  and thousands of others who died on September 11th go to building what.org
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:33.120]  building what.org but I think it is actually maybe I should retract my apology I just don't like to hurt people's feelings to point out that the victims families are being demonized
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:50.120]  Manny Bidio you want to talk about that yeah it's it's completely it's awful how we're being treated in the media we're not only being demonized by by the likes of those chills that are on corporate TV you know we're being.
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:26:03.120]  In the city of New York we like I said we still don't have a memorial we're being used as pawns in the latest propaganda game that they're putting out there this community center issue in downtown Manhattan.
[2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:11.120]  They're putting their pitching us one against the other they're causing this disturbance to firm and fear and hatred.
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:21.120]  You know throughout the country based on the lies that we were told my uncle was murdered close to nine years ago my family has never been the same.
[2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:38.120]  I was both my grandparents shortly thereafter and I'm going to tell you we need this information to get into the hands and to the majority of people in this country to realize that there is a huge component to the event that we don't know about even down at ground zero
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:49.120]  The little tiny you know memorials that they have there they don't even show building seven it's part of the original complex I mean this is propaganda and it's unbelievable.
[2:26:49.120 --> 2:27:03.120]  Well that's why I raised the point is that they're grandstanding down there for more wars and all this using the attacks while blocking aid to the families and the emergency workers while demonizing the emergency workers.
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:08.120]  I mean Bob the reason I raise this is it just shows how sick these people are.
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:31.120]  Well again I I could care less kind of truth. I mean just for me I feel bad for family members that want to speak to the truth but you know I'm giving out as many of these people going back rally having on the show you know I wish I just wish any human being could prove to me that I'm wrong.
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:43.120]  So I can move on with my life but I can't move on with my life. So I have one job in life right now of course to take care of my grandchildren and grandchildren now but it's to prove how my son was murdered.
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:53.120]  And I have done that. I might die tomorrow you know when we talk about new investigation I can't care about new investigation I wanted I wish it could happen tomorrow but I could be dead tomorrow.
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:28:04.120]  So it's so important you know great people like you that invite me on the show that I can at least express my views. I at least I people 100 years from now will know that this is what I had said.
[2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:09.120]  And that's so important to me that's why I just can't get involved in back in Kennedy.
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:31.120]  No I understand it just shows how low they are to demonize the emergency workers and support the Republican Party that's who's mainly doing it blocking aid but some Democrats as well for the emergency workers and then calling them ambulance chasers and then the families aren't asking for anything but a new investigation and they call you scum when you lost.
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:37.120]  I mean it's just there it's over the top I can't believe how Alex governments are like that.
[2:28:37.120 --> 2:28:43.120]  I mean blame the government. It's constantly creating a strategy of tension and that's worldwide.
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:47.120]  And there it stops people from focusing on what should be focused on.
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:53.120]  It's what the whole mosque is all about or the community center everything's about that we only have all these issues.
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:56.120]  That's why I hate to get involved in that issue.
[2:28:56.120 --> 2:29:04.120]  Okay so so tell us tell us where the ads going to be airing and also people can donate on the site to get the ad to air more places.
[2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:07.120]  Well it's going to be it's going to go to New York City.
[2:29:07.120 --> 2:29:20.120]  You know of course that's the place one because it's going because we have talked to people in New York City can't have talked to counselors and you know everyone throughout New York City and hopefully the investigation will be in New York City.
[2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:24.120]  There's the whole purpose of it and they can set it to building what.org.
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:27.120]  I think that's where the donations go.
[2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:35.120]  Building what.org. We're going to come back for about 10 minutes with you guys. You've got the floor on other issues you want to cover Bob McElvane and Manny Badio.

[2:30:00.120 --> 2:30:05.120]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:08.120]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[2:30:08.120 --> 2:30:12.120]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[2:30:12.120 --> 2:30:16.120]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[2:30:16.120 --> 2:30:22.120]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[2:30:22.120 --> 2:30:26.120]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[2:30:26.120 --> 2:30:30.120]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[2:30:30.120 --> 2:30:31.120]  You have been warned.
[2:30:31.120 --> 2:30:35.120]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law.
[2:30:35.120 --> 2:30:39.120]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[2:30:39.120 --> 2:30:42.120]  Don't tread on me. Rise the republic. Terrany is upon us.
[2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:46.120]  But liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[2:31:59.120 --> 2:32:01.120]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[2:32:01.120 --> 2:32:04.120]  You've heard me talk about Calvin five-star subs for years.

[2:32:07.120 --> 2:32:10.120]  and compares to nothing you will find in stores.

[2:32:19.120 --> 2:32:21.120]  Take my word for it.
[2:32:21.120 --> 2:32:24.120]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[2:32:24.120 --> 2:32:27.120]  Since 1947, Calvin's soap company has been showing consumers
[2:32:27.120 --> 2:32:30.120]  that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[2:32:30.120 --> 2:32:33.120]  Buy American and stay clean as well as support info wars.

[2:32:58.120 --> 2:33:00.120]  Thank you.
[2:33:00.120 --> 2:33:05.120]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[2:33:05.120 --> 2:33:07.120]  in the heart of The Resistance.
[2:33:07.120 --> 2:33:10.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:14.120 --> 2:33:17.120]  Bob McElvane had lost his son on 9-11.
[2:33:17.120 --> 2:33:20.120]  And of course, Maddie Bedejo lost his uncle or with us.
[2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:25.120]  And together with other great New Yorkers and victims, family members,
[2:33:25.120 --> 2:33:27.120]  they've launched BuildingWhat.org.
[2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:30.120]  And they're going to have the TV ads running in New York and worldwide
[2:33:30.120 --> 2:33:33.120]  on the internet, get the video, get it out to everyone you know.
[2:33:33.120 --> 2:33:38.120]  If you can donate, donate because Resistance is victory.
[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:40.120]  And more and more people are learning about Building7.
[2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:44.120]  And I believe it's the key to folks then finding out
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:47.120]  about all the other evidence of inside job.
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:50.120]  In closing, Bob McElvane, Maddie Bedejo,
[2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:52.120]  closing comments from both of you.
[2:33:52.120 --> 2:33:54.120]  You've each got about four minutes.
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:33:59.120]  Okay, Bob, I want you to end it very simply.
[2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:02.120]  The truth saves lives, okay?
[2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:05.120]  Once we get to the bottom of what took down that building,
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:09.120]  we're going to be able to get to the bottom of what's in all the first responders' lungs
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:10.120]  that are killing them.
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:13.120]  And science has already proven that there's nanothermetic material
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:17.120]  in all samples of the debris that's been tested independently.
[2:34:17.120 --> 2:34:23.120]  This BuildingWhat campaign is uniting a range of different groups.
[2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:27.120]  We're talking architects and engineers, political leaders for 9-11 Truth,
[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:31.120]  firefighters for 9-11 Truth, NYCCAM lawyers for 9-11 Truth.
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:35.120]  We have a lot of different groups that are coming together to get the word out
[2:34:35.120 --> 2:34:38.120]  in order to save lives, change public perception,
[2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:45.120]  and get to the bottom of the murder of Uncle Tom, of Bobby, and 3,000 others.
[2:34:45.120 --> 2:34:48.120]  And it's vitally important that we do this.
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:50.120]  This is a campaign that was started last year.
[2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:53.120]  Bob spoke with City Council.
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:58.120]  Then we did a fax and an e-mail write-of-call campaign,
[2:34:58.120 --> 2:35:01.120]  not only to City Council, but to the District Attorney of Manhattan.
[2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:06.120]  And now we're informing the people of New York starting here in New York,
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:08.120]  and then we're going to move on to other cities.
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:11.120]  We've raised, and the website doesn't reflect this yet,
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:14.120]  close to $24,000 already.
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:18.120]  And it's about $750 on average to reach about 10,000 viewers.
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:20.120]  We want to reach millions of viewers.
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:24.120]  Again, once people see this, it's going to change perception.
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:27.120]  People will critically think and have more of an open mind.
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:31.120]  And once we get to the bottom, once we get people going on this
[2:35:31.120 --> 2:35:35.120]  and get to the bottom of the murder, we can then say countless lies.
[2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:39.120]  Well said, Bob McElvane. Your closing thoughts.
[2:35:39.120 --> 2:35:42.120]  Well, I heard you say knowledge is power.
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:48.120]  And Bobby always had a poster, you know, hanging up on his wall,
[2:35:48.120 --> 2:35:50.120]  which said knowledge is power.
[2:35:50.120 --> 2:35:52.120]  And that's so important, you know.
[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:54.120]  If you have any new listeners or anyone,
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:57.120]  I mean, just think of yourself as a parent and your son was murdered.
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:35:59.120]  Your daughter was murdered.
[2:35:59.120 --> 2:36:01.120]  And nothing happened.
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:03.120]  You never had an investigation.
[2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:07.120]  I mean, or even the commissioners agreed that there was not an investigation,
[2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:11.120]  that the investigation was a sham, that the investigation was set up to fail.
[2:36:11.120 --> 2:36:15.120]  Now, what are you supposed to think as a parent?
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:20.120]  Well, the only thing I can do is I have to carry out my own investigation.
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:24.120]  And I've been doing this every day of my life since 2001.
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:30.120]  I went to 95% of the commission hearings to listen to General Myers say
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:33.120]  that we were looking outward.
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:37.120]  There's another possibility that four planes blew around for two hours
[2:36:37.120 --> 2:36:39.120]  and we did nothing to intercept them.
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:46.120]  That's the only conclusion I can come to is that the government had to be involved in this.
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:49.120]  And that's where knowledge is power comes in.
[2:36:49.120 --> 2:36:54.120]  So many people that don't blame family members because it is so difficult to look at
[2:36:54.120 --> 2:36:58.120]  because they don't want to know exactly how their son or daughter died
[2:36:58.120 --> 2:37:00.120]  or their sister or brother.
[2:37:00.120 --> 2:37:04.120]  But I've done my legwork, you know, but because I'm not a TV personality,
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:09.120]  I'm not a politician, people think, well, I've been told I'm being emotional about it.
[2:37:09.120 --> 2:37:15.120]  But as I said before, I wish, I truly, truly wish someone anywhere could come to sit down
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:20.120]  and talk to me and say, I am 100% wrong and prove to me that I am wrong.
[2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:22.120]  And again, my life would be so much better.
[2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:23.120]  But they can't.
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:24.120]  That's why I won't be on TV.
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:26.120]  No one wants to talk about it.
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:29.120]  The only thing they can do on TV in the media is call your name.
[2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:31.120]  That's the best they can do.
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:36.120]  So this what's happening in New York City, the fact that we'll be here, the people,
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:38.120]  it just doesn't get into the media.
[2:37:38.120 --> 2:37:41.120]  People in my support group still don't know about Tower 7.
[2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:43.120]  No one knows about Tower 7.
[2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:46.120]  So hopefully that will light a light in their minds.
[2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:51.120]  But also they will seek out the knowledge because knowledge is truly power.
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:52.120]  It is.
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:54.120]  And that's the only way this can happen.
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:57.120]  And the more we put it out there, the more knowledge people will find.
[2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:01.120]  Buildingwhat.org, go there, get the ad.
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:02.120]  Give it to everyone you know.
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:03.120]  Email it out.
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:04.120]  Donate.
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:05.120]  Buildingwhat.org.
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:06.120]  Bob McElvane.
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:07.120]  Manny Medeo.
[2:38:07.120 --> 2:38:08.120]  God bless you both.
[2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:13.120]  And we look forward to talking to you in the near future to track the success of this operation.
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:14.120]  You're running for truth.
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:15.120]  Knowledge is power.
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:16.120]  God bless you both.
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:17.120]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:18.120]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:21.120]  Great Americans standing up for truth and justice.
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:23.120]  And we're not going to stop.
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:25.120]  You know, we had what Bill Doyle on a few years ago.
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:27.120]  The biggest victims family group.
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:30.120]  And he said more than half the members believe the government carried out the attacks and
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:31.120]  that he believes it as well.
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:34.120]  So we've got to get that news out to people.
[2:38:34.120 --> 2:38:37.120]  Now, shifting gears.
[2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:44.120]  Everybody else in this country and worldwide now with a globalist during control of their soft kill eugenics operation is under attack with a
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:55.120]  general A, the mercury, the vaccines, the GMO foods, all of it, the fluoride in the water. And I am trying to culture jam.
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:39:00.120]  We're going to put it up on screen using one of their favorite search terms and favorite diversions.
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:06.120]  Lindsay Lohan and a bunch of doctors that even worked with the government have come out and admitted.
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:11.120]  Look, her shrinks put her on a bunch of psychotropic and Adderall speed.
[2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:13.120]  This is what's been making her act so crazy.
[2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:16.120]  And I've broken it all down in this 11 minute video.
[2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:20.120]  We'll come back in the final segment cover other key news in the shower.
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:24.120]  But Lindsay Lohan poisoned is the search term today.
[2:39:24.120 --> 2:39:28.120]  So this video and the story that accompanies it will be number one.
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:35.120]  Please search the term Lindsay Lohan poisoned and we'll reach a lot of zombies that don't know what's happening.
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:38.120]  Lindsay Lohan poisoned.
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:43.120]  I know what you're thinking. Why is Alex Jones talking about Lindsay Lohan?
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:45.120]  I'll be quite honest with you.
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:53.120]  If I can get you to pay attention to this key information I'm about to cover by mentioning Lindsay Lohan, I'll do it.
[2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:58.120]  Because Lindsay Lohan is just another individual on this planet like everybody else.
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:05.120]  And a lot of top doctors have come out and said, look, we have interviewed her and we've done medical exams.
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:11.120]  And she shouldn't have been on Adderall, which is basically a form of methamphetamine.
[2:40:11.120 --> 2:40:16.120]  And this can cause the same effects in people that cocaine and methamphetamine does.
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:21.120]  And that several doctors believe that this is why she's been so out of control.
[2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:23.120]  Well, no kidding.
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:31.120]  School children in this country, millions of them are put on Adderall and other amphetamine type drugs like Ritalin.
[2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:40.120]  And in the inserts for the drug, it says it can cause brain shrinkage, heart expansion, all sorts of serious health problems.
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:46.120]  When I was in junior high, one of the kids on the football team died of a heart attack and the doctor said it was the Ritalin.
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:49.120]  I mean, this is an ongoing nightmare.
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:51.120]  Look at these drugs.
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:57.120]  New reports have come out that over 80% of the drugs, the new drugs they're selling, prescription drugs,
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:02.120]  A, don't treat what they claim they're treating, and B, have toxic side effects.
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:07.120]  I mean, you've all seen the drug ads on TV where they'll say, having trouble urinating every few hours?
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:09.120]  Take this drug, but it may...
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:14.120]  Also increase the chance of serious skin reactions or stomach and intestine problems.
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:19.120]  Dry mouth, insomnia, sexual side effects, diarrhea, nausea, and sleepiness.
[2:41:19.120 --> 2:41:20.120]  Muscle pain or weakness.
[2:41:20.120 --> 2:41:23.120]  Unusual changes in mood or behavior or thoughts of suicide.
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:30.120]  But if you look at the mass shootings, and every time I see a case of a mother who chops her toddler's arms and legs off,
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:35.120]  or straps their four kids in their car and drives it off a cliff into a lake and drowns them,
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:41.120]  in every case they've been on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which is the Prozac class of drugs.
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:44.120]  They were being developed in the early 1980s.
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:52.120]  Their own studies by Eli Lilly and others with Prozac showed that it caused a massive increase in suicidal tendencies.
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:57.120]  Now they've tested it on rats, shrimp, guinea pigs, you name it.
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:04.120]  And they found that it causes reckless and even suicidal behavior in not just mammals, but things like shrimp.
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:06.120]  But it all makes perfect sense.
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:16.120]  When you actually read the molecular breakdown and the drug inserts for these fluorine or fluoride-based serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs,
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:22.120]  they are in the hallucinogen class. They are a psychotropic subclass of hallucinogens.
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:25.120]  So most days you're going to have a good trip on this stuff.
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:28.120]  You're going to be happy, not worried about a thing in the world.
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:30.120]  But what happens when you have a bad trip?
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:32.120]  You cut your children's arms and legs off.
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:34.120]  You go into a school and murder people.
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:41.120]  In every case that we've seen, the system knows that these drugs are destroying people.
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:53.120]  They're hardcore profiteers. And statistically, most people that get on the speed-type drugs or the hallucinogen serotonin reuptake inhibitors get more psychological problems.
[2:42:53.120 --> 2:42:56.120]  And then the answer is, not less drugs, it's more drugs.
[2:42:56.120 --> 2:43:05.120]  We see the same thing with all these reports coming out in Europe, the United States, and Asia, where three-year-olds, five-year-olds, six-year-olds, seven-year-olds,
[2:43:05.120 --> 2:43:12.120]  and babies in some cases are growing breast, going into menstruation, starting to have their periods,
[2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:19.120]  because of the bisphenol A that's in the plastic products and the hormones that are added to the food.
[2:43:19.120 --> 2:43:22.120]  And what do doctors there in the U.S. do whenever that happens?
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:32.120]  The American Medical Association says, give them hormones to counterbalance the hormones that are in the food and water and the packaging.
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:36.120]  Instead of, hey, get your kids off of these hormones.
[2:43:36.120 --> 2:43:43.120]  Here's two articles on that subject that just came out today. Babies with breast shock China.
[2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:47.120]  They're getting upset about children as young as a year and a half old.
[2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:50.120]  Here in the U.S., it's only three-year-olds who are going into puberty.
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:55.120]  In China, you know, year and a half, two years old, babies with breast.
[2:43:55.120 --> 2:44:02.120]  Here's another one, fury in China as female babies grow breast after drinking milk laced with hormones.
[2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:06.120]  At least the Chinese are getting angry.
[2:44:06.120 --> 2:44:12.120]  When China catches their executives, tanning the milk and the food, they execute them.
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:16.120]  And there's been cases of that, but not here in the United States.
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:18.120]  It's all just swept out of the rub.
[2:44:18.120 --> 2:44:30.120]  The system counts on your ignorance. In the last decade, multiple times, over 90% of the EPA and another movement of the FDA,
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:39.120]  of their own scientists, went on record and testified before Congress that sodium fluoride causes cancer, IQ reduction, brain damage, you name it.
[2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:41.120]  It doesn't even strengthen teeth.
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:47.120]  And once the government's answered, we're going to increase in many cities the amount of fluoride that we're adding to the water.
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:57.120]  And now the city of Watsonville has been cited by the California Department of Public Health for failure to comply with an order by the state to fluoridate the water supply.
[2:44:57.120 --> 2:45:01.120]  And now Schwarzenegger has gotten laws rammed through to get this done.
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:09.120]  This is a massive chemical attack that reduces fertility, that increases bone cancer and attacks every organ in the body.
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:16.120]  It's admitted on record, and it's literally being done to make you servile zombies and submissive.
[2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:19.120]  And now the government's coming out saying, yeah, we do do it to make you submissive.
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:24.120]  And we want to put lithium in your water to make you submit and be happy.
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:27.120]  The government's going to perfect you and make you happy.
[2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:33.120]  And we've got vaccines that will go in and reprogram your brain so you won't feel stressed and get angry.
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:36.120]  This is a plague upon all of us all.
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:43.120]  This is a military industrial complex, big pharma war against free humanity. The facts are in.
[2:45:43.120 --> 2:45:47.120]  We're all victims of this, not just Lindsay Lohan.
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:49.120]  They know that they're selling this death.
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:51.120]  But let's get into vaccines.
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:54.120]  Wolfgang Wudarg, the head of the EU Commission, a medical doctor,
[2:45:54.120 --> 2:46:00.120]  conclusively found with his board of other scientists and doctors that the H1N1 was a toxic vaccine
[2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:05.120]  and was a hoax, and that medical companies, the big vaccine makers that made tens of billions of dollars,
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:12.120]  paid off European and other Western governments, including the United States, to go out and hype fears.
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:17.120]  And now we have the statistics out of England where they've suspended the H1N1 shot
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:24.120]  because of a tenfold increase in violent convulsions in under five-year-olds.
[2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:28.120]  It's giving them chronic brain inflammation, brain damage.
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:33.120]  And if your child happens to have a convulsion after the vaccines, then the CPS comes and takes them.
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:38.120]  Well, now the media's back. Tom Thumb is offering a big discount on your groceries
[2:46:38.120 --> 2:46:44.120]  to get the new H1N1 shot for 2010, combined with a regular flu shot.
[2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:49.120]  The government is all over the newspaper saying everyone must take it, or we're basically all dead.
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:52.120]  So they were caught hoaxing everyone last year.
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:55.120]  It came out it was a hoax, and are they ashamed of what they've done?
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:46:58.120]  No. They're back pushing it, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:47:00.120]  They know full well what they're doing.
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:02.120]  It's like the Gardasil shot.
[2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:06.120]  On its own insert, it admits it doesn't protect you from papilloma, virus, and cervical cancer.
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:12.120]  And it admits that it's actually maimed and killed many people and caused autoimmune disorders.
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:20.120]  So now they're back again trying to force-feed us their mercury-laced, deadly vaccines in 2010,
[2:47:20.120 --> 2:47:26.120]  even after the EU and the British Medical Journal exposed them for the fraud they were involved in.
[2:47:30.120 --> 2:47:35.120]  I've interviewed the former head of the Pentagon's depleted uranium program, Dr. Doug Rocky.
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:40.120]  And up until the mid-1990s, the Pentagon admitted that DU, depleted uranium,
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:46.120]  was deadly poisonous and radioactive, that it would hurt the people that lived in the countries where we used it,
[2:47:46.120 --> 2:47:48.120]  and that it would also hurt our trips.
[2:47:48.120 --> 2:47:54.120]  Now they're using it at hundreds of different types of munitions, and the statistics and studies are coming in.
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:58.120]  From Iraq, in cities like Fallujah, where it's been used,
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:06.120]  with a four-fold increase in all cancers and a 12-fold increase in childhood cancers in under 14s,
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:12.120]  and the images of the mutated, deformed children with two heads or without legs,
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:17.120]  and the fact that their blood's been tested and they're full of depleted uranium, it is so inhuman.
[2:48:17.120 --> 2:48:22.120]  And our troops go into these areas and breathe it and absorb it as well,
[2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:25.120]  and we're seeing massive increases in deformities of their children.
[2:48:25.120 --> 2:48:30.120]  Now what does it say about our government? That they had developed this stuff in the 40s as a weapon,
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:33.120]  but they wouldn't use it until 1991.
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:40.120]  And there is a multi-billion-year half-life on this depleted uranium, and it is a scourge upon humanity,
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:45.120]  and it's now being used in firing ranges across the United States, near to major cities.
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:50.120]  If you're asking why this is happening, it's not just about profits, it's about power.
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:52.120]  It's about population reduction.
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:56.120]  We have covered the White House science are calling for drugging the water to sterilize people.
[2:48:56.120 --> 2:49:01.120]  We've gone over, you know, the hundreds of different government documents that call for it as well.
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:07.120]  But just in the last few weeks, one of our infowars.com writers did some amazing research and found published,
[2:49:07.120 --> 2:49:13.120]  admitted on the Rockefeller Foundation's own website studies where in the 60s,
[2:49:13.120 --> 2:49:19.120]  they were putting massive amounts of money into compounds that could be added to vaccines
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:25.120]  so that you'd be given a vaccine for tetanus or the flu that would then go in and reduce fertility.
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:30.120]  So everybody doesn't get sterilized because then people would notice only certain percentages.
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:37.120]  And so they talked about how to secretly do this and put it into the vaccines to sterilize people.
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:41.120]  And now it's been done, and they're expanding this system.
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:46.120]  There is something to the science of vaccines and how you could take a little of something that's bad
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:49.120]  so that your body learns to defeat it.
[2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:55.120]  But the issue is the UN, our own government, has been caught adding real polio to vaccines all over the world
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:58.120]  every year killing people in mass, and they just get away with it.
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:01.120]  They've been caught adding cancer viruses to polio vaccines.
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:06.120]  They've been caught adding other systems to tetanus shots to carry sterilization compounds.
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:10.120]  They've been caught doing everything the Rockefellers funded in the 60s.
[2:50:10.120 --> 2:50:15.120]  This is a total military takeover, but it's by stealth.
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  And it's not just Lindsay Lohan being targeted by these poisons, by these drugs, by the stuff in the water.
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:23.120]  It's all of us. We're all under attack.
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  And these drugs and chemicals make us more unhealthy.
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:28.120]  They make us more mentally unstable.
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:31.120]  So the system has a pretext to come in and control our lives.
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:38.120]  Please warn everyone you know and spread this video to everyone you can so that we can stop this madness.
[2:50:38.120 --> 2:50:43.120]  Our entire civilization is under threat by the scientific dictatorship.
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:45.120]  Folks, it's up to you.
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:49.120]  Lindsay Lohan Poisoned is the search term.
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:52.120]  Three words, Lindsay Lohan Poisoned.
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:55.120]  Lohan spelled L-O-H-A-N.
[2:50:55.120 --> 2:50:57.120]  Lindsay Lohan Poisoned.
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:24.120]  Let's make it number one. We'll be right back with more news.
[2:51:27.120 --> 2:51:29.120]  Most debt problems are confronted directly.
[2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:34.120]  Beneficial settlements, manageable monthly payments, and quick restoration of credit are more easily attained.

[2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:03.120]  They help to create a new world order.
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:06.120]  We are part of a new world order.
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:09.120]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[2:52:09.120 --> 2:52:14.120]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:18.120]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[2:52:18.120 --> 2:52:20.120]  It means all the world under their control.
[2:52:20.120 --> 2:52:23.120]  The United Nations would take over America.
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:26.120]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[2:52:26.120 --> 2:52:34.120]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[2:52:34.120 --> 2:52:39.120]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[2:52:39.120 --> 2:52:42.120]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[2:52:42.120 --> 2:52:49.120]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[2:53:58.120 --> 2:54:01.120]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[2:54:01.120 --> 2:54:22.120]  Continuing with the topic we were just covering, Finland suspends swine flu shots
[2:54:22.120 --> 2:54:25.120]  that were vaccine linked with neurological disorder.
[2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:27.120]  Well, it causes hundreds of different disorders.
[2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:32.120]  The insurgents admit that. England, their own government has said doctors don't give it to under-fives,
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:39.120]  tenfold increase in seizures, in many cases leading to permanent forms of epilepsy,
[2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:41.120]  totally frying your brain.
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:44.120]  And this is on infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:54:44.120 --> 2:54:47.120]  He's got links to mainstream news reporting on it.
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:50.120]  Finland's National Institute for Health and Welfare, the THL,
[2:54:50.120 --> 2:54:55.120]  is suspended the use of H1N1 vaccine over fears that the shot is linked to 300% increase
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:55:00.120]  in cases of the neurological disorder narcolepsy, where you just fall asleep,
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:02.120]  uncontrollably.
[2:55:02.120 --> 2:55:05.120]  Among children and young people over the last six months,
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:08.120]  the news is sure to discourage more parents from vaccinating their children
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:14.120]  in the coming months with the swine flu shot now being combined with the regular seasonal flu jab.
[2:55:14.120 --> 2:55:18.120]  A recent RAS music poll showed 52% of Americans were concerned about the safety of the vaccines.
[2:55:18.120 --> 2:55:23.120]  Record low numbers last year and this year took the H1N1 and the regular seasonal
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:26.120]  because of your efforts, my efforts, and other people getting the word out.
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:29.120]  Now, the British Medical Journal admits it's a fraud.
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:34.120]  The European EU Health Commission, this is all fact.
[2:55:34.120 --> 2:55:36.120]  And they don't care.
[2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:38.120]  They're back with their hoax again saying, take it again.
[2:55:38.120 --> 2:55:40.120]  Warn everyone you know.
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:44.120]  I know a talk show host here in town who didn't believe me about this stuff took the shot
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:47.120]  and his hands and feet got paralyzed, got numb for about a month.
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:51.120]  The doctor said, yeah, you have Guillain-Barre, but thank God it went away.
[2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:54.120]  It all varies what it does to you.
[2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:59.120]  Continuing, FDA uses egg recall to demand more power, authority over food.
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:07.120]  So no one's gotten even sick from this in many areas of the country,
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:09.120]  but they're recalling it in two states.
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:14.120]  1,300 people have become sickened, but thank God nobody's died.
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:18.120]  But they're trying to use it as a way to totally take over all farm production.
[2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:24.120]  Meanwhile, they're pushing poisonous drugs, vaccines, all of this on everyone.
[2:56:24.120 --> 2:56:26.120]  So very, very important information.
[2:56:26.120 --> 2:56:29.120]  Of course, already covered the French news agency.
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:35.120]  Spill, oil spill cleanup workers suffered chromosome damage, respiratory illnesses.
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:39.120]  And they're still trying to tell everybody it's fine.
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:44.120]  You don't need to wear a mask because if they ever admit it's dangerous, then there could be claims.
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:52.120]  So they're knowingly sending you out there to have irrevocable damage, irrevocable damage.
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:56.120]  This just illustrates how the controllers could care less about your health.
[2:56:56.120 --> 2:56:58.120]  In fact, they enjoy lying to you.
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:07.120]  Get wise about this and think of how many people we can wake up when they go look at Lindsay Lohan poisoned as the number one search term.
[2:57:07.120 --> 2:57:11.120]  Then they see the video in the news article about I got Kurt doing another one.
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:16.120]  When they see the term Lindsay Lohan poisoned, that'll be a minor blurb in the article he's doing right now.
[2:57:16.120 --> 2:57:23.120]  And it's going to talk about the vaccines and the brain damage and the poisoning and the autoimmune results in the brain.
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:30.120]  And you can write your own articles with Lindsay Lohan poisoned in the headline with your own information that you want to have the public see.
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:32.120]  This is going to be a big search term today.
[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:34.120]  Lindsay Lohan poisoned.
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:39.120]  Continuing with other lies, more troops head to Iraq as Obama declares mission accomplished.
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:44.120]  CNN, Fox, The Guardian, New York Times, General Electric.
[2:57:44.120 --> 2:57:47.120]  They're all admitting, oh yeah, we're sending more troops.
[2:57:47.120 --> 2:57:48.120]  They're all reporting this.
[2:57:48.120 --> 2:57:52.120]  It's all by General Electric, NBC on General Electric.
[2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:59.120]  They're all saying, oh, we're just renaming the combat brigades to something else, taking some troops out, sending them to Afghanistan,
[2:57:59.120 --> 2:58:02.120]  sending a few thousand home for photo ops that the war is over.
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:10.120]  Just like Bush said, seven plus years ago, months after the war started, that the war was over, military operations were over.
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:11.120]  Same hoax.
[2:58:11.120 --> 2:58:14.120]  Just like eight years ago, they said Iraq had nukes.
[2:58:14.120 --> 2:58:17.120]  Eight years later, they're saying Iran has nukes.
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:20.120]  They just used the same lies over and over again.
[2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:28.120]  Meanwhile, dozens killed in a series of bomb attacks and different Iraqi news media and officials are saying they think the Iraqi government is bombing.
[2:58:28.120 --> 2:58:33.120]  This is big news in Iraq as a way to keep more U.S. forces there.
[2:58:33.120 --> 2:58:36.120]  We are out of time, ladies and gentlemen, for this hour.
[2:58:36.120 --> 2:58:38.120]  Don't forget the website infowars.com.
[2:58:38.120 --> 2:58:39.120]  God bless you all.
[2:58:39.120 --> 2:58:59.120]  Great job, crew.
