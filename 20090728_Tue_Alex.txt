[00:00:05.074 --> 00:00:06.375]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.137]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:09.899]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:11.481]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:13.042]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:17.247]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.247 --> 00:00:21.291]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:46.051]  You found us, ladies and gentlemen, the front lines in the info war, the tip of the spear in the global fight to unlock the minds of the people of this planet to the scientific dictatorship of the New World Order.
[00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:49.114]  The cashless society control grid, the technological
[00:00:51.756 --> 00:01:01.563]  System that is being set up as a electronic cybernet to control and micromanage every facet of our lives.
[00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:07.487]  The forced drugging of the population, the forced drugging of the water supply.
[00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:15.612]  In short, the planetary government, which has been developed and set up by the eugenicists.
[00:01:15.612 --> 00:01:17.894]  This is in all their official documents.
[00:01:19.187 --> 00:01:25.650]  Okay, I have been really changing my ways.
[00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.351]  Not that anybody requested I do it.
[00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:32.632]  I think it's important to grow and do things a little bit differently occasionally.
[00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:41.436]  When you went back and listened to my show 12 years ago, I took mainly calls and had some guests and engaged in a few rants per broadcast.
[00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:53.484]  And more and more the last few years, I've noticed that I will just jam-pack the entire show with informative guests, and then I'll do hour-long, two-hour-long rants, and sometimes not get to your calls.
[00:01:53.484 --> 00:02:03.810]  And when I do, the people holding are the folks that'll sit there for an hour, and there's absolutely no rhyme or reason half the time, and, well, that's not the case anymore.
[00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.242]  I am doing a better job of taking your phone calls, and today I want to do this.
[00:02:09.242 --> 00:02:18.529]  I'm going to tell you about the news articles coming up, the important headlines, the key issues we're going to be covering, and also some of the guests that are coming up today.
[00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:28.356]  I'll do that in the next segment, but right now I just want to say that in this first hour, we're going to have first-time callers.
[00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.758]  Then in the second, third, and fourth, it's a free-for-all.
[00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:43.662]  But I want to have first-time callers to have a chance to call in to the phones today.
[00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.962]  And I'm not going to even answer the phones right now.
[00:02:45.962 --> 00:02:48.443]  I'm going to do this coming up during the break.
[00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:56.325]  And I want first-time callers to have a chance to call into the radio show.
[00:02:56.325 --> 00:03:01.446]  And specifically on the topics I covered Sunday and Monday, Sunday and yesterday,
[00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:18.198]  With the swine flu hype and hundreds of news articles every few days preparing the public, all the different newscasts preparing the public for forced flu inoculation coming up in the fall and winter.
[00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:22.739]  Open talk of martial law, quarantines, lockdowns of cities.
[00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:30.082]  This is really being openly discussed and pushed and the public is being prepared for this so we need to have a large
[00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:34.092]  Open discussion, a detailed discussion of this issue.
[00:03:35.856 --> 00:04:01.655]  So please, first-time callers on that subject, if you've got any item or any angle or any question or comment or point you want to make, what you think's really going on here, what your gut and your intellect tells you is coming up in the fall and winter, is this just hype to sell vaccines and further federalize and globalize responses through the World Health Organization, or are they planning to release some other mutated virus to engage in mass culling?
[00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:04.597]  I mean, when you've got these eugenicists like the White House,
[00:04:06.957 --> 00:04:13.300]  Science czar calling for mass culling and forced inoculation and putting drugs in the water to sterilize the public.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.421]  I mean, we gotta look at that!
[00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:20.124]  They're telling us they're doing it, so we better pay attention.
[00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:30.189]  And you can also, of course, discuss and talk about National Level Exercise 2009 with FEMA and troops from 14 different nations we've identified.
[00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:33.879]  Running martial law operations nationwide.
[00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:42.745]  Any eyewitness reports or other reports or mainstream reports you want to call in with, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:42.745 --> 00:04:43.626]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:43.626 --> 00:04:58.976]  First-time callers on any of those three big subjects in the first hour, then free-for-all in the second, third, and fourth hour with some guests I'll tell you about coming up, and a bunch of important news we'll get into straight ahead.
[00:04:58.976 --> 00:04:59.437]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.742]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:09.783]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:15.665]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:16.305]  It's true.
[00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:20.747]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.747 --> 00:05:27.269]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:30.350]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here to
[00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.890]  We're good.
[00:06:01.283 --> 00:06:07.086]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.086 --> 00:06:14.669]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.832]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:23.233]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:25.733]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:06:25.733 --> 00:06:37.316]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:37.316 --> 00:06:38.976]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.976 --> 00:06:40.837]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:47.078]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:56.006]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:57.587]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.587 --> 00:07:01.190]  The people strike back!
[00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.850]  Attention!
[00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:16.922]  An important product from HempUSA.org, Micro Plant Powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[00:07:17.202 --> 00:07:25.848]  Microplant powder is 89% silica and packed with a negative charge that attracts positive toxins from the blood, organs, spine and brain.
[00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:31.792]  This product has the ability to rebuild cartilage and bone which allows synovial fluid to return to the joints.
[00:07:31.792 --> 00:07:37.636]  Silica is a precursor to calcium meaning the body turns silica into calcium and is great for the heart.
[00:07:37.636 --> 00:07:43.299]  There is no better time than now to have micro plant powder on your shelf or in your storage shelter.
[00:07:43.299 --> 00:07:46.241]  And with an unlimited shelf life you can store it anywhere.
[00:07:47.142 --> 00:07:47.462]  We're good to go.
[00:08:26.534 --> 00:08:52.357]  I was in the break room getting a cup of delicious, hot, steaming coffee when C-SPAN had the minority leader of the Republican Party in the house up there giving a speech and it said on the screen that Sonia Sotomayor has been approved by a massive, massive majority.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:09.291]  So I will break that down, but the Senate Judiciary Committee has approved her nomination to be the newest member to the Supreme Court.
[00:09:09.291 --> 00:09:16.237]  I have the most ridiculous email in my email box from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:16.237 --> 00:09:18.559]  A reporter asking me, is it true
[00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:31.071]  That I'm on air saying the government has released the swine flu to stop illegal immigration.
[00:09:33.527 --> 00:09:36.469]  Where do these people get this information?
[00:09:36.469 --> 00:09:38.591]  The government wants open borders.
[00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:47.939]  They want to break down the borders of this country and drive down wages so that the poor Latin Americans have nowhere to run for a better life.
[00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:51.742]  And so that Americans are all destitute and bankrupt and poor.
[00:09:51.742 --> 00:09:53.864]  They want us poor so we have to join the military.
[00:09:56.932 --> 00:09:58.653]  And go fight in their wars for empire.
[00:09:58.653 --> 00:10:00.513]  They want us poor so we're in their system.
[00:10:00.513 --> 00:10:01.694]  That's in their own documents.
[00:10:01.694 --> 00:10:05.655]  They want us dependent under their control.
[00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:19.980]  But I'm going to have to call the Wall Street Journal up and say, where did you get this wild conspiracy theory that I think the government wants the borders shut?
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.902]  Man, I tell you, these people, they will just twist anything and everything you say and do.
[00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:42.762]  Well, I want Kurt Nemo or Paul Watson or Aaron Dykes or Steve Watson, one of our writers, to do a blurb and just point out that she wrote a book saying that there's no right to the Second Amendment.
[00:10:42.762 --> 00:10:47.983]  We've read from her book the quotes saying there's no individual right to keep and bear arms.
[00:10:47.983 --> 00:10:55.485]  And so I get up on air and I say, I don't like Sonia Sotomayor because she's an anti-Second Amendment.
[00:10:55.485 --> 00:10:58.946]  And the media's answer is, if you don't like her, you're a racist.
[00:11:00.287 --> 00:11:22.587]  That's what Politico's got an article out today saying that if you question Barack Obama's birth certificate receipt, he's got a receipt of live birth, not a birth certificate, and if you question the fact that why does the media keep lying and saying that's a birth certificate, me thinks you protest too much like they say in Hamlet,
[00:11:23.268 --> 00:11:25.989]  I didn't even believe this was real a year ago, really.
[00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:27.429]  And now I think something's to it.
[00:11:27.429 --> 00:11:28.930]  It's guilty as they act.
[00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.691]  Looked like Sylvester with Tweety Bird feathers sticking out of his mouth.
[00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:43.475]  You know, saying he doesn't know where Tweety Bird is and he doesn't like to eat Tweety Birds.
[00:11:43.475 --> 00:11:49.777]  You'd have to be knocked upside the head by Mike Tyson in his prime seeing Tweety Bird to believe that.
[00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:53.034]  And it's just everywhere!
[00:11:53.034 --> 00:11:54.254]  You're just a racist!
[00:11:54.254 --> 00:11:55.435]  You don't want to turn your guns in?
[00:11:55.435 --> 00:11:56.695]  You're a racist!
[00:11:56.695 --> 00:12:10.303]  You don't like the fact that Obama has all these different names and different dads and different families and lied and said he didn't go to madrasas and now brags and says he did get schooled in madrasas?
[00:12:10.303 --> 00:12:11.083]  And I'm not here!
[00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:14.145]  I don't have Islamophobia!
[00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:17.366]  I'm certainly not some Muslim basher hiding under the bed from him.
[00:12:17.366 --> 00:12:20.448]  I'm just saying, that guy is a liar!
[00:12:22.884 --> 00:12:25.386]  He's even a liar about being an African.
[00:12:25.386 --> 00:12:42.776]  That is a black African, an indigenous African, not a North African, who happen to be Middle Easterners, who moved in and mixed with the African, the Oriental.
[00:12:42.776 --> 00:12:45.738]  Yeah, you didn't know that people in Latin America are Oriental and
[00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:48.759]  European mix?
[00:12:48.759 --> 00:12:52.262]  You didn't know people in North Africa or an Oriental?
[00:12:52.262 --> 00:12:54.544]  Anglo?
[00:12:54.544 --> 00:12:59.829]  Oh, gonna be technical Caucasian and Anglo would be a Barret.
[00:12:59.829 --> 00:13:01.271]  Somebody from those isles.
[00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:02.632]  Gaelic?
[00:13:02.632 --> 00:13:05.875]  That's the incredible part is people don't even know where they come from or who they are.
[00:13:05.875 --> 00:13:07.376]  It just makes my head spin.
[00:13:07.376 --> 00:13:12.181]  Did you know Barack Obama's mama was as white as the side of a
[00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:20.317]  I don't know, an ice cream truck is white.
[00:13:20.317 --> 00:13:23.960]  His mama is as white as white flour.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.143]  There you go.
[00:13:28.143 --> 00:13:31.286]  And his daddy hailed as a black Arab.
[00:13:31.286 --> 00:13:37.932]  He was part of that sect, part of that Muslim sect that feeds on the black Christians.
[00:13:37.932 --> 00:13:40.234]  He backs up his cousin, Odinga,
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.142]  Who openly runs massive purges, burning down churches and driving Christians out of Kenya.
[00:13:46.142 --> 00:13:48.143]  I mean, that's on record!
[00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:49.944]  This guy's got family.
[00:13:49.944 --> 00:13:53.846]  I mean, you want to actually talk about some Muslims somewhere in the world that are actually killing Christians?
[00:13:53.846 --> 00:13:57.288]  There's only a few places, and it's all in Eastern and North Africa.
[00:13:58.522 --> 00:14:01.363]  Northeastern Africa and North Africa.
[00:14:01.363 --> 00:14:09.648]  That's the only place in the world, except in a few more tribal operations in Indonesia, and that's just tribal groups killing each other.
[00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:11.309]  They've always been killing each other.
[00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:25.516]  But the only real place you find Muslims really killing Christians is in a few areas of eastern and northern Africa, and one of the chief people doing it is Obama's cousin!
[00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:27.677]  So you bet there's something to him being a Muslim.
[00:14:28.789 --> 00:14:31.930]  And the type of Muslim that do run around killing Christians.
[00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:38.971]  They don't kill Christians in the real Muslim countries.
[00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:44.592]  They basically revere Jesus.
[00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:51.133]  They think he did rise up into the sky on the Mount of Olives.
[00:14:51.133 --> 00:14:56.474]  Some of the oldest Christian missions in the world are in Iraq and Persia, Iran.
[00:14:57.794 --> 00:15:02.315]  Egypt, everywhere else, it is asinine.
[00:15:02.315 --> 00:15:12.597]  But you actually get somebody who is killing Christians and is a Muslim, and his name is Barack Hussein Obama!
[00:15:12.597 --> 00:15:14.117]  Oh, I just can't take it anymore.
[00:15:14.117 --> 00:15:20.058]  It is just so insane.
[00:15:20.058 --> 00:15:23.479]  It is so, truth is so much stranger than fiction.
[00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:25.399]  We got a guy named Barry Sotero,
[00:15:27.546 --> 00:15:30.929]  His grandma says he was born in Kenya.
[00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:32.870]  They got a shrine up at his birthplace.
[00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.992]  It's all over the African news he was born there.
[00:15:34.992 --> 00:15:38.835]  Because they're proud of it.
[00:15:38.835 --> 00:15:47.922]  And you notice the spin has now started with the White House Press Secretary Gibbs and others.
[00:15:47.922 --> 00:15:49.983]  That, oh, he's a citizen.
[00:15:49.983 --> 00:15:52.445]  Well, yeah, you can be a citizen and not born here.
[00:15:52.445 --> 00:15:54.167]  But he's not eligible to be president.
[00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:54.427]  And look,
[00:15:55.598 --> 00:16:06.329]  Again, I got a lot of criticism because I weighed into this, I had some guests on, I listened to it, but I didn't put in the Obama deception, which I think is still good because it covers all the other issues that nobody wants to talk about.
[00:16:06.329 --> 00:16:08.491]  All the proven stuff.
[00:16:08.491 --> 00:16:13.856]  The fact that everything he says he do, he pledged, he doesn't want 80.
[00:16:13.856 --> 00:16:17.280]  But at the same time, I don't want to obsess over Barack Obama.
[00:16:20.786 --> 00:16:41.700]  As a cult of personality, with an 84% approval rating, coming into office, riding a wave of success never before seen, he was very dangerous controlling the House, the Senate, and the Executive.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.481]  Controlled the Legislative and the Executive and a lot of Courts.
[00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:46.683]  Not the entire Judiciary, but very close.
[00:16:48.971 --> 00:16:53.433]  That's the trifecta, as Bush would call it.
[00:16:53.433 --> 00:16:59.635]  Both branches of legislative and the executive, and then of course the bureaucracy and the National Security Council's the real government.
[00:16:59.635 --> 00:17:02.656]  So he's got complete control of that, and that made him very dangerous.
[00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:12.900]  So I said we gotta stall his agenda, expose him, but then we can't let the New World Order boomerang around his political gravity well, like the sun.
[00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:20.019]  And use a false, fake Republican revolution against him.
[00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:40.485]  Because we know the globalists control both parties and then bring in something just as bad or worse, we have to discredit both parties and cause a true restoration of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and point out special interest, foreign corporate interest, a foreign corporate takeover has happened and discredit the whole system.
[00:17:40.485 --> 00:17:50.433]  Because as long as you let them play WWF wrestling tag team and, you know, they put a Democrat in and we wake up they're a scam, and then we put a Republican in and we wake up that they're a scam, and then
[00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.871]  We wake up that they're a fraud.
[00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:54.313]  We put a Democrat in.
[00:17:54.313 --> 00:17:56.556]  Ring around the Rosie, on and on and on.
[00:17:56.556 --> 00:18:03.003]  It's so elementary, but because it's so elementary, it works like a charm.
[00:18:03.003 --> 00:18:06.467]  And I know you as listeners know this, but the public's just now starting to get it.
[00:18:06.467 --> 00:18:07.308]  Joe the Plumber now...
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:22.869]  Told the Associated Press and Reuters yesterday, it was articles in both publications about it, that he sees through both parties, and both parties are bad, and it's globalism, and that it's the carbon tax, and that we've got to get control of our government.
[00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:31.455]  So he was being used as a Republican stooge for McCain, who has taken a dive, a ringer in this Don King heavyweight bout.
[00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:36.349]  And now he's awake.
[00:18:36.349 --> 00:18:39.611]  And Congress has that 11% approval rating.
[00:18:39.611 --> 00:18:41.632]  And that's good.
[00:18:41.632 --> 00:18:43.593]  Because they're all a bunch of whores.
[00:18:43.593 --> 00:18:48.115]  You got a few good people like Ron Paul and Louie Gohmert and a few others.
[00:18:48.115 --> 00:18:56.099]  There's a handful of them.
[00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:57.460]  And we've got to support them, but...
[00:18:58.593 --> 00:19:27.195]  As long as we get sidetracked with all these diversionary issues of Michael Jackson, and I'm sorry, another diversionary issue, you know, the NAACP and Obama and the phony right-wing, they're all, we've got to talk more about race, we've got to, no, that means have more political power and more racial division and more tribalism for the limousine liberals that pimp all this out.
[00:19:29.124 --> 00:19:31.145]  That's all it is, is tribal politics.
[00:19:31.145 --> 00:19:53.837]  Instead of discussing the economy imploding and the massive job losses and the $23.7 trillion stolen by the private federal reserve in ten months, no, everybody's got a way in about the cops arresting the black professor in Cambridge and Obama calling it stupid and analyzing every facet of it.
[00:19:54.713 --> 00:19:58.596]  Meanwhile, they're getting ready to inject everybody with deadly flu vaccine.
[00:19:58.596 --> 00:20:01.099]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:03.160]  This is Alex Jones with important news.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.103]  I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[00:20:06.103 --> 00:20:08.345]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know.
[00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:09.326]  Here's the story.
[00:20:09.326 --> 00:20:14.130]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.371]  Now here's the bad news.
[00:20:15.371 --> 00:20:20.455]  The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[00:20:20.455 --> 00:20:22.317]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt.
[00:20:22.557 --> 00:20:27.179]  Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[00:20:27.179 --> 00:20:32.682]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[00:20:32.682 --> 00:20:34.883]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst.
[00:20:34.883 --> 00:20:43.887]  Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[00:20:43.887 --> 00:20:49.070]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies and is flat out the best course of its kind.
[00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.231]  I recommend you visit this important new website at
[00:20:51.471 --> 00:20:53.176]  MakeHerbalMedicines.com.
[00:20:53.176 --> 00:20:55.964]  That's MakeHerbalMedicines.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:06.304]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[00:21:06.304 --> 00:21:10.025]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[00:21:10.025 --> 00:21:12.926]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:19.507]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[00:21:19.507 --> 00:21:21.848]  The only real option is precious metals.
[00:21:21.848 --> 00:21:27.549]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down.
[00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.631]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package.
[00:21:31.631 --> 00:21:36.153]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[00:21:36.153 --> 00:21:40.575]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:21:40.575 --> 00:21:46.197]  That's 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:21:46.197 --> 00:21:50.099]  And together we can develop a make sense program before the clock runs out.
[00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:54.781]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128.
[00:21:54.781 --> 00:21:57.482]  And take charge of your future and thank you.
[00:22:02.135 --> 00:22:12.944]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:22.010]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.491]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:37.678]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:37.678 --> 00:22:39.339]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:39.339 --> 00:22:41.200]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.562]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told.
[00:22:46.209 --> 00:22:48.110]  And his real agenda.
[00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:56.373]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:56.373 --> 00:22:57.953]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.953 --> 00:22:59.114]  The people strike back!
[00:23:00.885 --> 00:23:05.129]  Being a part of Life Change Tea has been an exhilarating experience.
[00:23:05.129 --> 00:23:06.671]  I love the testimonies.
[00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:09.273]  Julian New York writes, I love this product.
[00:23:09.273 --> 00:23:10.174]  I feel great.
[00:23:10.174 --> 00:23:11.475]  It worked immediately.
[00:23:11.475 --> 00:23:13.437]  You can feel the cleansing right away.
[00:23:13.437 --> 00:23:16.480]  Other products don't work right away like this one does.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.242]  Mrs. Luella from Missouri writes,
[00:23:18.622 --> 00:23:20.925]  My daughter has lost 27 pounds.
[00:23:20.925 --> 00:23:22.286]  She loves the tea.
[00:23:22.286 --> 00:23:28.272]  And David from Tennessee writes, My wife has a lot of digestive problems and the tea really helps her a lot.
[00:23:28.272 --> 00:23:29.293]  I like it too.
[00:23:29.293 --> 00:23:32.056]  And here's my favorite from CJ in Minnesota.
[00:23:32.056 --> 00:23:33.978]  He writes, This stuff really works.
[00:23:34.378 --> 00:23:36.339]  No, I mean it really works.
[00:23:36.339 --> 00:23:38.741]  No, I mean it really works.
[00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:42.003]  Be one of the many testimonies that we receive every month.
[00:23:42.003 --> 00:23:45.065]  Order today online at GetTheTee.com.
[00:23:45.065 --> 00:23:47.526]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:48.807]  Or you can call us at 928-308-0408.
[00:23:48.807 --> 00:23:49.848]  You know the number, 928-308-0408.
[00:23:49.848 --> 00:23:51.089]  Be our next testimony.
[00:23:51.089 --> 00:23:52.830]  You love us, and we love you.
[00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.551]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[00:24:05.196 --> 00:24:16.219]  Paul, Donna, Russ, Yannick, David, and many others.
[00:24:16.219 --> 00:24:18.400]  Your calls are coming up here in just a moment.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.580]  And I'm going to get more into this later.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.202]  It's just, I hear adults calling in like children.
[00:24:26.227 --> 00:24:35.713]  Weighing in like it's junior high gossiping around the water fountain during the five-minute break between classes.
[00:24:35.713 --> 00:24:48.641]  Sounds like a bunch of 12-year-old girls calling in, groveling to the police or groveling to the professor and taking sides and fighting with each other.
[00:24:48.641 --> 00:24:50.582]  And it's much to do about nothing.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.563]  Our whole society is in flux.
[00:24:54.563 --> 00:24:56.885]  A technological revolution is here.
[00:24:56.885 --> 00:25:04.834]  The globalists have openly said because of robotics and standardization and production lines that they don't need us anymore.
[00:25:04.834 --> 00:25:10.821]  The official policy is to at least reduce the world population by 80% and they're now engaging it.
[00:25:11.121 --> 00:25:17.648]  With weather modification, with controlled droughts, and admitting they're manipulating the weather, but saying details are classified.
[00:25:17.648 --> 00:25:20.170]  They're admittedly poisoning the water and food.
[00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:29.140]  They're admittedly sterilizing us, and I hear these adults calling in about the diversion of the day.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:33.284]  Now some things are diversions, but at the same time they're still serious, like Sotomayor.
[00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:47.445]  Sotomayor openly wrote a book, and we've written articles about it at Infowars and PrisonPlanet.com, saying you have no right to keep and bear arms, and in testimony she said, I don't know if you have a right.
[00:25:48.868 --> 00:25:53.610]  Now, when somebody says, I don't know if you have a right to own guns, that means she's going to vote against them.
[00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:57.071]  They're putting somebody on there who's more anti-gun than the last person.
[00:25:57.071 --> 00:26:02.413]  They almost, by one vote, said no right to keep and bear any arms last year.
[00:26:02.413 --> 00:26:08.935]  They lost by one vote, but they still put in the decision that, oh, we can still, under law, restrict your Second Amendment.
[00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:18.352]  And now they've had the federal court out in California with the Ninth Circuit come out and say, yeah, we can ban your guns under the Second Amendment.
[00:26:18.352 --> 00:26:20.672]  Your right means we can take your guns.
[00:26:20.672 --> 00:26:25.334]  You have a right to hand them in, basically.
[00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:28.154]  Well, now they got the votes to ban the Second Amendment.
[00:26:28.154 --> 00:26:29.675]  Look out!
[00:26:29.675 --> 00:26:35.096]  And I guess if I don't turn in my grandfather's deer rifle that he gave my father, that my father gave me,
[00:26:36.232 --> 00:26:38.953]  I'll be lynched as being against Hispanics.
[00:26:38.953 --> 00:26:40.974]  See, this is mental illness.
[00:26:40.974 --> 00:26:48.256]  They know the public's dumbed down, very simple-minded, can barely understand simple concepts, so it's just, bad man.
[00:26:48.256 --> 00:26:49.416]  You don't want to turn your guns in?
[00:26:49.416 --> 00:26:50.477]  Bad man.
[00:26:50.477 --> 00:26:51.997]  You don't want to pay higher taxes?
[00:26:51.997 --> 00:26:53.678]  Bad man.
[00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:55.858]  You want to see Obama's birth certificate?
[00:26:55.858 --> 00:26:57.799]  Bad man.
[00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:59.140]  Bad man.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.860]  It's what a three-year-old can understand.
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.101]  That is a bad man.
[00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:03.021]  I have a chihuahua.
[00:27:03.857 --> 00:27:05.878]  You can say this is a bad person.
[00:27:05.878 --> 00:27:06.738]  That's a bad person.
[00:27:06.738 --> 00:27:07.878]  Bad man.
[00:27:07.878 --> 00:27:10.499]  And the Chihuahua will start growling and get upset.
[00:27:10.499 --> 00:27:16.081]  The general public is about as smart as my Chihuahua.
[00:27:16.081 --> 00:27:20.222]  We're now training the French Bulldog that's six months old.
[00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:20.823]  Bad person.
[00:27:20.823 --> 00:27:21.403]  Bad person.
[00:27:21.403 --> 00:27:22.723]  And he'll start growling.
[00:27:22.723 --> 00:27:27.685]  It's a joke because he's so cute and lovable and pathetically silly.
[00:27:29.119 --> 00:27:30.460]  Oh God, help me.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:36.883]  And so more and more I realize, let me just say this to the listeners, and not our general listeners, but new listeners.
[00:27:36.883 --> 00:27:49.070]  David Rockefeller, bad man, has written several memoirs and an op-ed for the New York Times saying Mao Zedong and communism is good.
[00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.071]  Why would a top banker be for communism?
[00:27:51.071 --> 00:27:56.014]  Because they make you live under a communist system, take all your wealth and give it to themselves offshore.
[00:27:56.929 --> 00:28:02.213]  David Rockefeller, bad man.
[00:28:02.213 --> 00:28:06.436]  Sonia Sotomayor, bad lady.
[00:28:06.436 --> 00:28:08.938]  Barack Obama, bad man.
[00:28:08.938 --> 00:28:13.722]  He read off teleprompter.
[00:28:13.722 --> 00:28:17.204]  Speech writers write lies.
[00:28:17.204 --> 00:28:19.026]  He actor.
[00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:21.367]  He read them to you.
[00:28:22.936 --> 00:28:27.279]  Sodium fluoride in tap water.
[00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:30.461]  Bad for you.
[00:28:30.461 --> 00:28:35.063]  Do you understand me?
[00:28:35.063 --> 00:28:38.826]  You are being distracted.
[00:28:38.826 --> 00:28:42.768]  Do you know what that word means?
[00:28:42.768 --> 00:28:47.431]  It means, have you seen the bull fight?
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:56.124]  The bullfighter uses red cape to distract bull.
[00:28:56.124 --> 00:29:05.130]  He then stabbed bull with sword when bull run at red cape.
[00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.392]  Sonia Sotomayor.
[00:29:08.392 --> 00:29:12.014]  Same story.
[00:29:12.014 --> 00:29:16.376]  Barack Obama black professor police story.
[00:29:16.376 --> 00:29:17.457]  Red cape.
[00:29:20.146 --> 00:29:24.027]  The sword is the Federal Reserve.
[00:29:24.027 --> 00:29:26.087]  They stab us.
[00:29:26.087 --> 00:29:27.827]  Bad man.
[00:29:27.827 --> 00:29:29.188]  New World Order.
[00:29:29.188 --> 00:29:31.888]  Bad man.
[00:29:31.888 --> 00:29:34.028]  Government corrupt.
[00:29:34.028 --> 00:29:36.289]  Bad man.
[00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:37.529]  Bad man.
[00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:39.189]  Government too big.
[00:29:39.189 --> 00:29:40.990]  Bad man.
[00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:44.070]  Pentagon work for foreign banks.
[00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.230]  Corporate takeover.
[00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.031]  Do you understand corporate takeover?
[00:29:51.263 --> 00:29:55.184]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.184 --> 00:30:00.745]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.745 --> 00:30:02.425]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:07.166]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:30:07.166 --> 00:30:10.147]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:30:10.147 --> 00:30:13.188]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:30:13.188 --> 00:30:19.029]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:22.492]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:30:22.492 --> 00:30:29.499]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:30:29.499 --> 00:30:32.782]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:30:32.782 --> 00:30:34.143]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[00:30:37.867 --> 00:30:38.568]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:38.568 --> 00:30:38.988]  A new world order.
[00:30:38.988 --> 00:30:39.528]  In the near future.
[00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.312]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:10.312 --> 00:31:13.174]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:13.174 --> 00:31:15.915]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:19.097]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:19.097 --> 00:31:26.422]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:34.895]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.895 --> 00:31:38.757]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.757 --> 00:31:41.319]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.319 --> 00:31:42.500]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.280]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.561]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:45.542]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:46.683]  That's what they're after usually.
[00:31:46.683 --> 00:31:51.446]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:31:55.148 --> 00:31:58.210]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.291]  You have been warned.
[00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:03.875]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:09.200]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.241]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:11.241 --> 00:32:16.246]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:16.246 --> 00:32:17.427]  How much do you want?
[00:32:17.427 --> 00:32:18.568]  When do you want it?
[00:32:18.568 --> 00:32:20.449]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:20.449 --> 00:32:21.510]  When will you need it?
[00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.712]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:23.712 --> 00:32:25.053]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:25.053 --> 00:32:25.794]  Will it make your children
[00:32:25.794 --> 00:32:26.574]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:26.574 --> 00:32:28.695]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:28.695 --> 00:32:30.515]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:55.063 --> 00:32:55.804]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:55.804 --> 00:32:58.605]  Judiciary Committee, okay, Sotomayor for High Court.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:23.585]  The Senate Judiciary Committee has voted to approve Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor to be the first Hispanic Justice.
[00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:34.894]  The committee voted 13 to 6 Tuesday morning to send Sotomayor nomination to the full Senate where she's expected to be confirmed easily next week.
[00:33:34.894 --> 00:33:40.438]  Quite a few of the Republicans voted for her.
[00:33:40.438 --> 00:33:42.640]  And remember, that means they are anti-gun.
[00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:50.593]  And this is a lady who's a member of La Raza, whose own motto is, for those inside the race, everything.
[00:33:50.593 --> 00:33:54.735]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:33:54.735 --> 00:33:59.298]  And see, I don't like the Ku Klux Klan, and I don't like Sonia Sotomayor.
[00:33:59.298 --> 00:34:03.140]  But see, racism is only from whites.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.943]  That's only because whites are some of the middle class and have something for the ultra-elite to rob.
[00:34:07.978 --> 00:34:16.021]  They're going to get rid of all this, Whitey's the evil one, once they're done destroying any middle class communities that are left.
[00:34:16.021 --> 00:34:19.582]  They now have a new term though, a minority majority.
[00:34:19.582 --> 00:34:33.027]  If there was one white person shaking in a corner being hunted down by wolf packs, that would be a, you know, evil oppressor.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:34.648]  And that's how the story goes.
[00:34:35.376 --> 00:34:39.097]  Meanwhile, they keep saying, oh, it's no big deal that we want this health care plan.
[00:34:39.097 --> 00:34:41.698]  It's not socialized health care.
[00:34:41.698 --> 00:34:50.281]  If you don't buy health insurance, they garnish your wages between $2,500 and $5,000, and that's just a start.
[00:34:50.281 --> 00:34:52.642]  That's a tax!
[00:34:52.642 --> 00:34:57.684]  That's a new tax on top of everything else, and then the insurance companies are owned by the big banks.
[00:34:57.684 --> 00:34:58.804]  That's them forcing you.
[00:34:59.909 --> 00:35:08.518]  But meanwhile, the precious illegal aliens, because they're there to drive down the wages, they get left alone by the police nationwide when they don't have even driver insurance.
[00:35:08.518 --> 00:35:11.561]  This is all a sick, sick system.
[00:35:11.561 --> 00:35:13.062]  Alright, I said I'm going to take a lot of your calls.
[00:35:13.062 --> 00:35:14.484]  I'm going to give each caller about a minute or so.
[00:35:14.484 --> 00:35:14.564]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:14.564 --> 00:35:17.326]  I really want to hear from you on a host of issues.
[00:35:17.326 --> 00:35:17.607]  Swine flu.
[00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:31.071]  Saying they're going to forcibly inoculate us, they're going to force police and health workers, that's in the news today.
[00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:39.138]  Because they've got to make the enforcers take it first, so they'll then say, hey, I had to take it, I'm going to make you take it.
[00:35:39.138 --> 00:35:49.226]  It's like they're making police departments put GPS trackers in their cars to track them, so when the feds make everybody else take them, which they're now proposing, the cops will say, hey, everybody gets one.
[00:35:49.226 --> 00:35:52.089]  It's kind of like the remake of the Dune book.
[00:35:53.533 --> 00:35:57.916]  Not a very good movie, not good like the book, but the heart plug.
[00:35:57.916 --> 00:36:01.259]  Hey, don't worry, everybody gets a heart plug here.
[00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:05.462]  Don't worry, the police all get heart plugs, so we're gonna force you to have a heart plug.
[00:36:05.462 --> 00:36:07.944]  If you haven't seen the movie, you don't know what I'm talking about.
[00:36:07.944 --> 00:36:15.610]  The control freak elites like having a little plug in your chest and they just pull a cord and it opens your heart up.
[00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:16.751]  Blood starts spewing out.
[00:36:18.345 --> 00:36:22.027]  You know, these Hollywood writers shouldn't give the elites ideas.
[00:36:22.027 --> 00:36:26.448]  Everyone has a heart plug for the government's security and everyone's safety.
[00:36:26.448 --> 00:36:37.353]  You know, Homeland Security proposed and actually had meetings with a company to make everybody wear taser bracelets when you get on a plane.
[00:36:37.353 --> 00:36:45.797]  That's one step away from heart plugs.
[00:36:45.797 --> 00:36:46.637]  Just total control.
[00:36:49.705 --> 00:36:51.046]  And NLE09.
[00:36:51.046 --> 00:36:52.446]  I'd like to keep the phones open.
[00:36:52.446 --> 00:36:53.787]  That's why I want to go through a lot of calls.
[00:36:53.787 --> 00:37:00.789]  So folks that have witnessed... Well, for those that just tuned in and may not know, because I'm getting emails saying, what's NLE09?
[00:37:00.789 --> 00:37:14.474]  Google NLE09 or search engine NLE09 and you can read all the press releases by FEMA.
[00:37:14.474 --> 00:37:16.995]  All the top links are
[00:37:18.658 --> 00:37:19.719]  FEMA.
[00:37:19.719 --> 00:37:22.962]  By the way, there's a new search engine that I'm trying to promote.
[00:37:22.962 --> 00:37:28.987]  Startpage.com is Google quality search, but then it doesn't log where you go and what you do.
[00:37:28.987 --> 00:37:37.094]  So I should say Startpage.com, but I have to then point out that means a search engine, because Google is now this ubiquitous term in the nomenclature.
[00:37:37.094 --> 00:37:40.457]  That's why I use that, but search engine Startpage.com.
[00:37:40.457 --> 00:37:43.559]  Go to Startpage.com and Google NLE09.
[00:37:45.914 --> 00:38:04.837]  National Level Exercise 09, that's foreign troops from 14 nations openly training to quote, take on American terrorists with Homeland Security, 30 plus federal agencies, 50 state police agencies, hundreds of local city agencies, and other volunteer community groups.
[00:38:04.837 --> 00:38:12.699]  And you go look at those groups, those are local tattletale squads, including Youth Brigade Eagle Scouts,
[00:38:13.855 --> 00:38:22.401]  Training to assist in quote, taking on and killing veterans in seek and destroy missions out of control veterans.
[00:38:22.401 --> 00:38:24.702]  And the number one threat of Homeland Security is veterans.
[00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:26.804]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:34.069]  And then also want to discuss the flu, Sotomayor, NLEO-9,
[00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:43.232]  John P. Holdren, bad man, flu shot, bad chemical.
[00:38:43.232 --> 00:38:45.473]  Anyhow, here's a couple of words from Birmingham, what's going on around us.
[00:39:10.287 --> 00:39:12.188]  Where I work at, I work at a hospital.
[00:39:12.188 --> 00:39:20.551]  I don't deal with patients, but it is required, mandatory for me, to get a flu shot in order to keep my job.
[00:39:20.551 --> 00:39:23.032]  So we're going to see how that plays out.
[00:39:23.032 --> 00:39:25.813]  Well, let me just stop because I want to hear more from you on this.
[00:39:25.813 --> 00:39:27.553]  I have a stack of mainstream news articles.
[00:39:27.553 --> 00:39:35.416]  They're all linked up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on today's kind of on-air bibliography that we have for the listeners each day.
[00:39:35.416 --> 00:39:37.377]  But it's AP, Reuters, New York Times.
[00:39:38.497 --> 00:39:39.598]  So what he's saying is true.
[00:39:39.598 --> 00:39:53.146]  They're saying all first responders, police, firemen, nurses, medical workers, janitors at hospitals, next county workers, state workers, you've all got to take it, but there's no law.
[00:39:53.146 --> 00:40:00.530]  They're just selectively enforcing under Obama's executive order that he reauthorized from Bush.
[00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.131]  It's originally Bush's executive order.
[00:40:02.791 --> 00:40:13.397]  You just Google executive order quarantine forced inoculation or startpage.com that and you can read the executive order for that, but still it's a load of bull.
[00:40:13.397 --> 00:40:22.382]  They can sign an executive order saying I gotta go, you know, lick the boots of Obama or kiss the hind end of George W. Bush.
[00:40:22.382 --> 00:40:23.443]  Doesn't mean I have to.
[00:40:23.443 --> 00:40:27.265]  You know, they tried this with the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[00:40:27.765 --> 00:40:31.587]  Well, they're saying that I have to get the shot unless I can get a doctor's exemption from the doctor.
[00:40:31.587 --> 00:40:36.028]  Well, you know, if you look at any medical form, there's three exemptions you can have.
[00:40:51.403 --> 00:40:58.688]  And, uh, one of them is an excuse from a doctor, one of them is a religious exemption, and the third is a cultural exemption.
[00:40:58.688 --> 00:41:02.551]  They have totally blown the other two exemptions off.
[00:41:02.551 --> 00:41:09.395]  Now, my state has, um, does not seem to recognize a cultural exemption anyways.
[00:41:09.395 --> 00:41:14.279]  Uh, all you can get for, uh, exemption forms are one from a doctor and one because of religious.
[00:41:15.407 --> 00:41:19.529]  So I'm not sure how this can play out for me on that.
[00:41:19.529 --> 00:41:28.474]  I think I was subject early in life to some of the NWO chemicals and I had an idiocratic disease as a baby.
[00:41:28.474 --> 00:41:30.335]  So maybe I can use that.
[00:41:30.595 --> 00:41:31.535]  But your body defeated it.
[00:41:31.535 --> 00:41:32.876]  You know, that's the point.
[00:41:32.876 --> 00:41:34.217]  Parents give their kids shots.
[00:41:34.217 --> 00:41:35.537]  It messes them up.
[00:41:35.537 --> 00:41:38.979]  If you'll just stop injecting them lunatics, they'll survive.
[00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:50.623]  But if you want them to die of leukemia, or die of bone cancer, or die of brain cancer, if you like lowering little kids into holes, just keep it up, psychos, because eugenicist Holdren openly wants you dead.
[00:41:50.623 --> 00:41:51.924]  He set it on record.
[00:41:51.924 --> 00:41:53.645]  These people aren't playing games.
[00:41:54.625 --> 00:41:56.587]  Why won't folks believe them?
[00:41:56.587 --> 00:41:58.829]  It's in the Memorandum 200 State Department.
[00:41:58.829 --> 00:42:02.913]  It's in the 1996 Biological Diversity Assessment UN.
[00:42:02.913 --> 00:42:04.134]  It's in the Club of Rome.
[00:42:04.134 --> 00:42:06.416]  It's in thousands of white papers.
[00:42:06.416 --> 00:42:07.417]  It's real!
[00:42:07.417 --> 00:42:10.340]  I'm sorry reality is scary.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:17.506]  But we told you in the studies that the Gardasil was killing girls and women and now it's all over the news.
[00:42:17.506 --> 00:42:20.229]  And listen, this is all color of law.
[00:42:21.724 --> 00:42:23.609]  They tell medical workers you have to do it.
[00:42:23.609 --> 00:42:25.393]  They tell you you have to have the exemption.
[00:42:25.393 --> 00:42:27.879]  There is no law.
[00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:29.062]  It's the same color of law.
[00:42:30.745 --> 00:42:34.387]  Where they tell kids, you've got to have shots to go to school.
[00:42:34.387 --> 00:42:36.868]  It's their policy.
[00:42:36.868 --> 00:42:44.113]  And generally, if you just ignore it and never get around to the shot, they'll kind of let it go under the radar.
[00:42:44.113 --> 00:42:47.494]  And then so many people refuse that they can't fire everybody.
[00:42:47.494 --> 00:42:51.197]  So what you do is you go talk to your friends after work.
[00:42:52.116 --> 00:43:00.904]  You give them literature about it, you pull up the LA Times article from 2003, where they ordered 14 million to take it, because most people are sheep-like.
[00:43:00.904 --> 00:43:13.134]  So if they see a group saying no, they'll say no, and go, here's Tommy Thompson in 2003, wouldn't take the smallpox shot, and so medical workers and doctors all said no, and it fell through.
[00:43:13.134 --> 00:43:16.697]  So all you do is go, don't you remember last time we said no?
[00:43:17.765 --> 00:43:32.012]  Don't you understand that they admit, I would create a packet, a fact sheet, that they're already admitting that this flu vaccine won't even cover the new mutation that's already happened for this supposed flu that isn't even that dangerous.
[00:43:33.169 --> 00:43:37.611]  And if you can get 10% to say no, they'll cancel the whole thing.
[00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:44.534]  And so, but on top of that, the military, they try to lie to them and say, you don't have any rights, you have to take it.
[00:43:44.534 --> 00:43:46.135]  You don't have to take experimental shots.
[00:43:46.135 --> 00:43:49.476]  This is an experimental shot, even if you were in the military.
[00:43:49.476 --> 00:43:51.857]  See, the troops don't know that, so they lie to them.
[00:43:54.124 --> 00:44:01.690]  This is such an important, heavy issue, but all I can tell you is that my dad doesn't take the hep shots.
[00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:02.911]  He's a dentist.
[00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:04.692]  This is a load of bull.
[00:44:04.692 --> 00:44:07.475]  And so they try to stampede people into doing it.
[00:44:07.475 --> 00:44:08.656]  Go ahead.
[00:44:08.656 --> 00:44:12.579]  Yeah, if you're a nurse going to nursing school, you don't have to take that hep shot.
[00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:14.300]  You do not have to take it.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:21.606]  You can say religious or cultural exemption and they'll just look at you dumbfounded or scream at you like a body snatcher, but they still can't make you take it.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.081]  That's where I'm at right now.
[00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:29.184]  This is the first time I've ever seen it put to me that you have to take the shot.
[00:44:29.184 --> 00:44:36.688]  So this is pretty, uh, and I can, you know, if you'd like, I'll send you the, uh, you know, the, the, the, uh, decree as you would have.
[00:44:36.688 --> 00:44:37.428]  Yeah, email it.
[00:44:37.428 --> 00:44:44.132]  Well, I mean, it's in the news, but it's good to have the decree because listeners still deny that even when they have AP telling them, but of course telling them how wonderful it is.
[00:44:44.132 --> 00:44:49.275]  Send it to Aaron with two A's at InfoWars.com or ShowTips at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:50.339 --> 00:44:57.203]  And one other thing really quickly about the police state, going down here in the ham of Alabama, that's Magic City.
[00:44:57.203 --> 00:45:01.866]  They have, they're having, not police, but SWAT teams.
[00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:07.410]  SWAT teams in the black parts of town are setting up roadblocks, checking people's IDs.
[00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.732]  You can't turn, if you try to turn around, they're coming after you.
[00:45:10.732 --> 00:45:15.635]  You know, stepping around the town when they're in their, in their boots, in their combat boots and all black uniforms.
[00:45:17.301 --> 00:45:23.924]  Yeah, that's why they're converting some police departments to 20% SWAT or auxiliary SWAT.
[00:45:23.924 --> 00:45:28.767]  This is going to be the paramilitary force that rules America.
[00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:30.408]  I appreciate your call.
[00:45:30.408 --> 00:45:33.429]  It's in State Department document 7277 from 1962.
[00:45:38.448 --> 00:45:42.730]  And they want worldwide special paramilitary type SWAT teams.
[00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:50.453]  They don't describe them as special weapons and tactics at that time, but it describes the uniform, everything.
[00:45:50.453 --> 00:45:56.676]  And the rest of the police are gonna be like social workers that inspect your house and boss you around and steal your kids.
[00:45:56.676 --> 00:46:04.079]  And the minute you say no, they're gonna pull back and they're gonna roll up with armored vehicles and just burn your house down.
[00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:04.900]  And that's the system.
[00:46:05.967 --> 00:46:07.167]  Period.
[00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:09.988]  And a lot of SWAT teams are like, don't you attack us!
[00:46:09.988 --> 00:46:13.589]  Hey, you individually may not be evil, but I've seen it for a decade.
[00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:24.673]  SWAT teams running roadblocks, SWAT teams take Illinois going door to door, quote, demanding to be let in to investigate people's guns without warrants.
[00:46:24.673 --> 00:46:28.054]  This is tyranny, period, and you know it.
[00:46:28.054 --> 00:46:29.814]  You know it.
[00:46:29.814 --> 00:46:32.515]  And the police who aren't for this, you better speak up and say no.
[00:46:34.212 --> 00:46:35.933]  Let's go ahead and talk to Donna in Ohio.
[00:46:35.933 --> 00:46:37.434]  Donna, go ahead.
[00:46:37.434 --> 00:46:38.154]  Hi, Alex.
[00:46:38.154 --> 00:46:43.577]  I've been listening to you since pretty much close to last Christmas.
[00:46:43.577 --> 00:46:53.403]  I went to check my shortwave to see if it worked down here in the basement in case we had to come down, you know, any time when there was a storm or anything.
[00:46:53.403 --> 00:46:57.465]  And here I got you on the shortwave.
[00:46:57.465 --> 00:46:58.986]  And I believe you.
[00:46:58.986 --> 00:47:01.868]  I believe you ever since the first time I heard you.
[00:47:02.426 --> 00:47:09.191]  And I'll tell you, I've been like a repellent to all my friends and family.
[00:47:09.191 --> 00:47:17.137]  Well, there were a lot of people in Nazi Germany who got laughed at saying Hitler was bad, but we're all being proven right, so you're doing a great job.
[00:47:17.137 --> 00:47:29.787]  I was over and went out for breakfast by myself, and I heard people talking about the flu shot, about getting sick and different things, and I went up to them.
[00:47:29.787 --> 00:47:31.108]  There were six men sitting there.
[00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:37.452]  And I don't know where I got the guts, but I went up to him and I told him about the flu shot.
[00:47:37.452 --> 00:47:42.633]  And the one guy told the other guy, don't pay any attention to her, don't talk to her, maybe she'll go away.
[00:47:42.633 --> 00:47:45.594]  So, I've been getting a lot of that.
[00:47:45.594 --> 00:47:55.717]  And I'll tell you what, though, I do have two friends of mine that almost think the same way I do.
[00:47:55.717 --> 00:48:00.798]  And some of my family don't believe everything I say.
[00:48:01.428 --> 00:48:07.130]  But I do believe that they're going to be coming in like in sections.
[00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.950]  You know what I mean?
[00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:16.834]  Right now we are not, we feel like we're not getting through to a lot of people and it just stresses us out.
[00:48:16.834 --> 00:48:30.619]  But I feel like God has an army and the ones that are in the front lines like you are right now are, and then the ones that know about this and believe it,
[00:48:31.274 --> 00:48:33.155]  They're in the front lines.
[00:48:33.155 --> 00:48:45.404]  And then gradually, there'll be, you know, things happening where more people will, when they see things happening that we've told them, will start believing.
[00:48:45.404 --> 00:48:49.226]  And I do believe that.
[00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:52.268]  I hear a lot of people saying, you're the leader.
[00:48:52.268 --> 00:48:53.929]  And I do believe that.
[00:48:53.929 --> 00:48:57.352]  And I'm older than you, and I'm going to tell you that you are.
[00:48:57.352 --> 00:48:58.933]  You're the only one that they trust.
[00:48:59.761 --> 00:49:03.084]  Because everything that you've said is true.
[00:49:03.084 --> 00:49:09.568]  I mean, not the only one, but there's other ones out there on the shortwave that are saying the same thing that you are.
[00:49:09.568 --> 00:49:11.450]  But most of them are too worldly.
[00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:12.751]  Most of them are too worldly.
[00:49:12.751 --> 00:49:19.196]  And they're doing it for some of the wrong reasons, and they let their message be tainted by infighting because they want to be number one.
[00:49:19.196 --> 00:49:24.099]  And those that want to be number one don't normally become number one or anything close to it.
[00:49:24.099 --> 00:49:25.961]  And it's a sad fact that
[00:49:26.846 --> 00:49:36.234]  A lot of people have missed the whole issue, just becoming obsessed over Alex Jones, but God bless you, and it's been great hearing from you, Donna.
[00:49:36.234 --> 00:49:45.181]  We're all leaders in this fight, and the point you brought up about sectors and sections, yes, we're all planting seeds.
[00:49:45.181 --> 00:49:50.886]  A lot of people will laugh at you at first, but down the road, they will remember what you told them.
[00:49:50.886 --> 00:49:55.630]  Or they may not even remember, but they'll have a memory of the information.
[00:49:56.772 --> 00:50:03.314]  But speaking of checkpoints and sectors, it's like what Tony Brown has said many times on this show.
[00:50:03.314 --> 00:50:06.735]  Black writer and commentator, TV host out of Chicago.
[00:50:06.735 --> 00:50:09.836]  What you see in the black community being done will be done in your community.
[00:50:09.836 --> 00:50:12.457]  And that's why that black professor got so angry and got mad.
[00:50:12.457 --> 00:50:13.958]  He doesn't understand the new police state.
[00:50:15.228 --> 00:50:36.766]  system where everybody's you know demanded to show their ID and I don't even think the cop was particularly out of line compared to a lot of other you know police forces things have been ratcheted up but a lot of black men do have a chip on their shoulder because they do get harassed I mean I've watched it in public places I've seen it as a white male I've experienced being treated differently
[00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:40.752]  But more and more, we get treated really bad.
[00:50:40.752 --> 00:50:44.214]  And so, they set up this martial law in black communities.
[00:50:44.214 --> 00:50:52.739]  Look at all these black mayors in Oklahoma and Arkansas declaring martial law and making blacks show IDs to leave their communities.
[00:50:52.739 --> 00:50:56.501]  They set the precedence in those communities.
[00:50:56.501 --> 00:50:57.462]  It's very, very serious.
[00:51:00.962 --> 00:51:08.284]  If the current state of the economy is severely impacting your life, this might be some of the most important information you will ever hear.
[00:51:08.284 --> 00:51:16.285]  As the economy continues to spiral out of control, many people, just like you, wonder how they will support their family and pay their bills.
[00:51:16.285 --> 00:51:19.926]  The government is not going to help out the people who desperately need it.
[00:51:19.926 --> 00:51:23.407]  It's time for you to look outside the box and change your life.
[00:51:23.407 --> 00:51:27.688]  If you're tired of the get-rich-quick schemes, if you're tired of living paycheck to paycheck,
[00:51:27.708 --> 00:51:28.229]  I don't know.
[00:51:48.889 --> 00:51:51.412]  Here's what you do to get Here's What You Do.
[00:51:51.412 --> 00:51:53.575]  Visit Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:51:53.575 --> 00:51:55.757]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:51:55.757 --> 00:51:57.739]  Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:51:57.739 --> 00:51:59.822]  And start changing your life today.
[00:52:01.255 --> 00:52:07.060]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:14.647]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.647 --> 00:52:20.812]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.232 --> 00:52:23.214]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.214 --> 00:52:25.715]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.715 --> 00:52:37.283]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.283 --> 00:52:38.964]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.964 --> 00:52:40.826]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:52:40.826 --> 00:52:47.050]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:47.725 --> 00:52:56.002]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:56.002 --> 00:52:57.566]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.566 --> 00:52:58.768]  The people strike back!
[00:53:00.523 --> 00:53:04.084]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[00:53:04.084 --> 00:53:13.706]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.

[00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:40.091]  Here is what one satisfied customer had to say about Heart and Body Extract regarding his angina pain.
[00:53:40.091 --> 00:53:43.132]  I haven't had an angina pain since I've been on it.
[00:53:43.132 --> 00:53:45.632]  The Heart and Body Extract is just so great.
[00:53:45.632 --> 00:53:50.193]  I thank God that I was led to this product that's doing so much for me and that can do so much for others.
[00:53:50.629 --> 00:53:54.177]  Call to order your 2 month supply of Heart and Body Extract today!
[00:53:54.177 --> 00:53:55.800]  Call 1-866-295-5305 or go to HBExtract.com
[00:54:23.951 --> 00:54:25.251]  Yeah, we took a couple calls.
[00:54:25.251 --> 00:54:29.112]  We're going to continue with them now.
[00:54:29.112 --> 00:54:40.514]  It's just when that lady was talking and that fellow before her, just every point they made, like a fractal, there were thousands of points I wanted to make.
[00:54:40.514 --> 00:54:48.116]  That's why I always interrupt, start chomping at the bit to just confirm what they're saying or add to it or tie it into other things.
[00:54:50.106 --> 00:54:58.512]  Because the picture is so clear when you in-depth study this year after year, day after day, just constantly.
[00:54:58.512 --> 00:55:13.944]  But imagine her out front of grocery store or hardware store or wherever she was, she didn't say, she sees these six men, you know how they'll do, sitting around on a park bench or sitting around by the Coke machines babbling.
[00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:15.886]  And imagine walking up to those old men
[00:55:17.987 --> 00:55:19.890]  I'm guessing they're old.
[00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:24.597]  Might have been young men sitting around talking.
[00:55:24.597 --> 00:55:28.062]  And saying, hey, don't take the flu shot, it's got a lot of dangerous stuff in it.
[00:55:28.533 --> 00:55:31.094]  Which it killed a whole bunch of people in 76.
[00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:35.215]  They shot a bunch of troops up at an army base, just like in 1918.
[00:55:35.215 --> 00:55:36.455]  Some of them died.
[00:55:36.455 --> 00:55:39.096]  Nobody else died except those on the base.
[00:55:39.096 --> 00:55:41.817]  They, of course, had the flu shot already made up.
[00:55:41.817 --> 00:55:44.097]  They killed some of the troops to scare the public.
[00:55:44.097 --> 00:55:45.138]  Shot everybody up.
[00:55:45.138 --> 00:55:46.818]  Thousands and thousands died.
[00:55:46.818 --> 00:55:56.461]  Gillian Bernays, a bunch of other brain disorders.
[00:55:56.461 --> 00:55:57.241]  On and on and on.
[00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:03.151]  I mean, it's admitted the flu shot killed people.
[00:56:03.151 --> 00:56:06.732]  And you walk over and tell these ignoramuses and you get laughed at.
[00:56:06.732 --> 00:56:08.793]  Don't talk to her and she'll go away.
[00:56:08.793 --> 00:56:10.814]  Like she was some phantom.
[00:56:10.814 --> 00:56:15.016]  A human being having the courage to come over and talk to you.
[00:56:15.016 --> 00:56:16.776]  You know what?
[00:56:16.776 --> 00:56:20.798]  Donna could be selfish and lazy like you jackasses.
[00:56:20.798 --> 00:56:23.499]  You think I want to talk to people in a grocery store?
[00:56:23.499 --> 00:56:28.881]  You think I don't want to just get my food and go home and hang out with my family and grill hamburgers or steaks?
[00:56:30.572 --> 00:56:34.095]  Grill some fish?
[00:56:34.095 --> 00:56:35.516]  You think I want to talk to you?
[00:56:35.516 --> 00:56:40.560]  You, as sullen and arrogant and full of yourselves are?
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.362]  But I got to.
[00:56:42.362 --> 00:56:44.664]  And so I talked to people in grocery store lines.
[00:56:44.664 --> 00:56:49.288]  I talked to two or three people in the TSA lines about how I was a police state.
[00:56:51.164 --> 00:56:52.526]  I don't care anymore!
[00:56:52.526 --> 00:56:58.873]  And I don't care if you slack-jawed, soft, un-American pieces of trash laugh at me.
[00:56:58.873 --> 00:57:00.355]  Because I'm not looking for you.
[00:57:00.355 --> 00:57:03.939]  I'm looking for real human beings I can warn.
[00:57:03.939 --> 00:57:07.322]  You like getting Alzheimer's when you're 45 from all those shots?
[00:57:07.322 --> 00:57:10.146]  You like dying of cancer and dropping dead like all these people?
[00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:15.712]  Okay, but I don't know that you're an idiot until I've talked to you.
[00:57:15.712 --> 00:57:23.275]  And then I feel sorry for you as more damaged goods, more people I can't help, more people I lose sleep trying to wake up.
[00:57:23.275 --> 00:57:24.735]  Listen to me.
[00:57:24.735 --> 00:57:29.997]  You may be driving along in your car listening for the first time and you don't like being talked to like this, but you listen to me and you listen good.
[00:57:31.786 --> 00:57:35.289]  And you let it sink in real good, buddy.
[00:57:35.289 --> 00:57:42.955]  If you've got any humanity and any instincts and any memory left, you've heard about vaccines killing a lot of people.
[00:57:42.955 --> 00:57:48.158]  And you're in some mind-mesmerized trance from the television and the culture.
[00:57:48.158 --> 00:57:49.520]  The Pentagon designed the flicker rate.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.241]  You're in a trance.
[00:57:51.241 --> 00:57:55.104]  And if you've got any consciousness left, you can pull yourself out of it with God's help.
[00:57:56.701 --> 00:58:03.264]  Because they have brainwashed you to think you've got some cute patty cake relationship with the government.
[00:58:03.264 --> 00:58:13.989]  And that they care about you, and it's fun, and like a little kid getting a lollipop, you go down and get your flu shot, and the nurse smiles at you like you've done good, and you're part of the team.
[00:58:13.989 --> 00:58:15.730]  Listen, stupid!
[00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:18.972]  You're being delayed, soft-killed, euthanized!
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.761]  But again, why am I even trying to wake you up?
[00:58:23.761 --> 00:58:25.702]  You probably had cowardly forefathers.
[00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:26.723]  A lot of this is genetic.
[00:58:26.723 --> 00:58:28.203]  Who wakes up and who doesn't?
[00:58:28.203 --> 00:58:31.425]  And at a certain level, the elite are right.
[00:58:31.425 --> 00:58:32.665]  You don't care?
[00:58:32.665 --> 00:58:33.386]  You want to die?
[00:58:33.386 --> 00:58:37.888]  Then roll your sleeve up and just enjoy.
[00:58:37.888 --> 00:58:42.350]  I want to wake up people that are ready to be woken up.
[00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:45.752]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.752 --> 00:58:47.813]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:54.832]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.832 --> 00:58:56.834]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.834 --> 00:59:05.360]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:10.924]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.924 --> 00:59:12.545]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.765 --> 00:59:19.289]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.289 --> 00:59:30.337]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.337 --> 00:59:31.117]  That's right.
[00:59:31.117 --> 00:59:33.679]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.679 --> 00:59:35.440]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:35.760]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:36.941]  Or visit acolablue.com.
[00:59:42.925 --> 00:59:46.748]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:46.748 --> 00:59:48.950]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:49.370]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.605 --> 01:00:08.387]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.387 --> 01:00:10.149]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.731]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.731 --> 01:00:13.272]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.272 --> 01:00:17.477]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.477 --> 01:00:21.541]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.517 --> 01:00:51.167]  If you know the flu vaccines have killed tens of thousands of people conservatively in the past, on record, this latest hyped event matches exactly what happened with the swine flu inoculations in 76, you are fundamentally warped if you're not warning the public.
[01:00:51.167 --> 01:00:53.749]  But then you warn the idiots and they laugh at you.
[01:00:53.749 --> 01:00:54.489]  It doesn't matter.
[01:00:54.489 --> 01:00:56.570]  You gotta move on to those that'll listen.
[01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.771]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:00:57.771 --> 01:00:59.351]  Russ in Texas.
[01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:00.132]  You're on the air, Russ.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.721]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:04.882]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:01:04.882 --> 01:01:17.212]  I just want to say that you are probably the shining example of what really needs to be done, and that is to continue education, continue to learn things so we can continue to educate others.
[01:01:17.212 --> 01:01:25.499]  I've been out talking to people for probably 15, 16 years now, and I talk to everybody, everywhere, in any line, in the bank, or whatever.
[01:01:25.499 --> 01:01:27.900]  And I'm finding that probably at least
[01:01:29.028 --> 01:01:35.350]  Close to half the people that I speak with are enlightened to some degree.
[01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:38.951]  And 10 years ago, it might have been 15%.
[01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:40.712]  I mean, look, we should be more positive.
[01:01:40.712 --> 01:01:42.293]  I should be more positive.
[01:01:42.293 --> 01:01:44.753]  I'm just so disgusted to see the elites up there.
[01:01:44.753 --> 01:01:46.994]  Because, see, we're not blind.
[01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:48.175]  We see them.
[01:01:48.175 --> 01:01:50.215]  We know the carnage.
[01:01:50.215 --> 01:01:57.318]  And we know that this evil is sitting right next to the good people, but the good people are under
[01:01:58.317 --> 01:02:03.681]  A delusion, and it's frustrating, but, look, we're getting ready to audit the Fed!
[01:02:03.681 --> 01:02:05.242]  Everybody's starting to wake up!
[01:02:05.242 --> 01:02:07.284]  This is so positive, praise God!
[01:02:07.284 --> 01:02:08.545]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:02:08.545 --> 01:02:19.533]  Yeah, you're a really terrific example, Alex, because you show people that, you know, that there can, the fruits can be had from continued hard work.
[01:02:19.533 --> 01:02:24.217]  With your permission, I'd like to give an announcement of an upcoming meeting in Dallas this evening.
[01:02:24.697 --> 01:02:40.706]  Sure, an opportunity for people to go out there and educate some of these conservative Republican yuppies that think they've got everything under control because they know about the economic situation, but that's only the beginning of things.
[01:02:40.706 --> 01:02:52.072]  In Dallas this evening, for all the Dallas Fort Worth listeners, Sheriff Richard Mack is going to be speaking in Addison at the May Dragon Restaurant, and that's at 4848 Beltline Road.
[01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:59.329]  Which is about one mile west of the Dallas North Tollway and Beltline Road.
[01:02:59.329 --> 01:03:03.372]  Alright, super, gotta let you go, appreciate your call.
[01:03:03.372 --> 01:03:10.017]  You notice though, even though I like Sheriff Mack, when I let these plugs happen, it'll just be one after the other until the show shuts down.
[01:03:10.017 --> 01:03:17.962]  Let's go ahead and talk to Yanique, or how do I pronounce that?
[01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:21.765]  Oh, Yanique, Yanique in Tennessee, thank you for calling.
[01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:23.747]  Hi, Gaffney and Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:03:25.745 --> 01:03:40.492]  I've been listening about your flu shot, and it's just so hard to tell, like, if you go down to churches and stuff and try to explain to the people, it's like, well, God wants it to happen, or, you know, it's whatever my doctor says.
[01:03:40.492 --> 01:03:41.713]  Yeah, they've capitulated.
[01:03:41.713 --> 01:03:49.737]  They just say, it's of the Lord, and not be involved in anything, and not be informed, and not care about my kids, and eat all the GMO.
[01:03:49.737 --> 01:03:51.238]  It's of the Lord!
[01:03:51.238 --> 01:03:53.199]  No, it's not of the Lord!
[01:03:53.199 --> 01:03:54.140]  It's of Satan!
[01:03:56.983 --> 01:04:00.105]  Yeah, it's just like, how do you get through to them, you know?
[01:04:00.105 --> 01:04:10.891]  It's like, you tell them what is really going on, not what they've been taught, and the preacher, the pastor won't let you come out and tell... Because he's a wicked devil!
[01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:15.013]  I mean, I'm surprised these preachers haven't grown forked tails.
[01:04:15.013 --> 01:04:21.757]  I mean, literally, they're on FEMA payroll, hired secretly to tell their flocks to submit.
[01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:22.378]  Ma'am, stay there.
[01:04:22.378 --> 01:04:23.959]  I'm gonna have you finish up and we'll get back.
[01:04:23.959 --> 01:04:25.820]  We're about to go to break, but take us out to break.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.060]  Go ahead.
[01:04:27.082 --> 01:04:28.383]  Yeah, it's just very hard.
[01:04:28.383 --> 01:04:31.346]  Their pastor won't let us say anything.
[01:04:31.346 --> 01:04:33.288]  You beat a watchman in the wall.
[01:04:33.288 --> 01:04:35.350]  I want to hear about this worm.
[01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:38.893]  I want to hear about where your church is and this devil.
[01:04:38.893 --> 01:04:42.517]  This devil you've got up there at the pulpit.
[01:04:42.517 --> 01:04:45.860]  You're not allowed to talk about... I'm going to explain this when we get back.
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.843]  How America became the Soviet Union.
[01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:49.083]  Okay?
[01:04:50.965 --> 01:04:52.627]  Oh my God, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:04:52.627 --> 01:04:55.289]  These are pulpit prostitutes.
[01:04:55.289 --> 01:04:59.113]  You might as well have a guy, Anton LaVey in red pajamas up there.
[01:04:59.113 --> 01:05:00.675]  It'd be better.
[01:05:00.675 --> 01:05:05.980]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.062]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:05:08.062 --> 01:05:10.504]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.504 --> 01:05:12.786]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.786 --> 01:05:14.408]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.408 --> 01:05:15.449]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.669 --> 01:05:24.093]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:05:24.093 --> 01:05:31.536]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:43.162]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:06:00.947 --> 01:06:06.168]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:06:06.168 --> 01:06:06.948]  Number one.
[01:06:06.948 --> 01:06:10.189]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:10.189 --> 01:06:10.889]  Number two.
[01:06:10.889 --> 01:06:16.090]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:16.730]  It's true.
[01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:21.151]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:21.151 --> 01:06:22.071]  Number three.
[01:06:22.071 --> 01:06:27.692]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:28.352]  Number four.
[01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:30.913]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:06:30.913 --> 01:06:31.093]  I think?
[01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:04.280]  Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.841]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[01:07:06.841 --> 01:07:16.525]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[01:07:16.525 --> 01:07:22.728]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[01:07:22.728 --> 01:07:25.429]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[01:07:25.429 --> 01:07:27.791]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[01:07:28.871 --> 01:07:29.071]  I think so.
[01:07:51.633 --> 01:07:53.114]  OwnMyself.com.
[01:07:53.114 --> 01:07:54.294]  It takes very little money.
[01:07:54.294 --> 01:07:56.895]  And if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[01:07:56.895 --> 01:08:05.799]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[01:08:05.799 --> 01:08:07.099]  Big Brother.
[01:08:07.099 --> 01:08:08.860]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.621]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.621 --> 01:08:12.202]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.202 --> 01:08:13.782]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.782 --> 01:08:17.964]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.964 --> 01:08:20.285]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:26.885]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:49.091]  For those that don't know, it is 180 degrees the opposite direction away from liberty and freedom, what this country was founded on, to have preachers telling their flocks, lay down to government, don't think, submit to flu shots, nothing's scary, just give me money and then you'll have financial success in life.
[01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:49.531]  It's voodoo!
[01:08:50.549 --> 01:08:51.769]  It's witch doctor crap.
[01:08:51.769 --> 01:09:02.873]  You know, these preachers, send me a thousand dollars and I'll send you a prayer cloth that'll heal you, or... I just can't handle it.
[01:09:02.873 --> 01:09:06.014]  And I could play the newscast, but I've played them over and over again.
[01:09:06.014 --> 01:09:09.875]  We got the secret documents a year and a half before it was mainstream news.
[01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:12.776]  Pastor Butch Paul here on the network and myself, two separate pastors,
[01:09:13.852 --> 01:09:20.317]  FEMA teaching them to prepare their flocks for forced inoculations, to go to FEMA camps, to let the state take their children.
[01:09:20.317 --> 01:09:30.525]  I mean, if I was in a church and my preacher got up and started saying, do what government says, let them break your families up, take the shots, I'd probably want to go punch him in the nose.
[01:09:30.525 --> 01:09:37.510]  I would stand up and start rebuking him, and if one of the thug gang member
[01:09:39.105 --> 01:09:40.747]  Usher's came and put their arm on me.
[01:09:40.747 --> 01:09:50.176]  I'd probably punch him in the face because they're in there trying to sell evil and tyranny and forced inoculations and death.
[01:09:50.176 --> 01:09:54.100]  I mean, folks, that is hard core tyranny!
[01:09:55.273 --> 01:09:59.716]  I mean, that is secret police whacked out East Germany.
[01:09:59.716 --> 01:10:04.018]  It doesn't get worse than kids being trained to spy on their parents.
[01:10:04.018 --> 01:10:06.940]  And now it's all over the news, with the news saying it's good.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:12.683]  You know, five years ago they'd say, oh, kids are tattling on their parents, is this good?
[01:10:12.683 --> 01:10:15.925]  Now they say, oh, isn't it wonderful?
[01:10:15.925 --> 01:10:18.046]  And the only thing worse is having the preachers
[01:10:19.161 --> 01:10:21.588]  And then we got hundreds of pages of FEMA documents.
[01:10:21.588 --> 01:10:26.382]  We scanned them in, they're on InfoWars, and the thumb-sucking public told us they weren't real.
[01:10:27.472 --> 01:10:30.073]  You could call the stinking FEMA numbers on them.
[01:10:30.073 --> 01:10:35.254]  Well, then it came out in national and local TV stations, but saying it was good.
[01:10:35.254 --> 01:10:42.476]  Oh, the preachers are preparing everyone to go to camps and take forced inoculations and turn their guns in.
[01:10:42.476 --> 01:10:44.577]  It's up the Lord!
[01:10:44.577 --> 01:10:45.217]  Don't believe me?
[01:10:45.217 --> 01:10:46.177]  Just search engine.
[01:10:46.177 --> 01:10:48.018]  Just startpage.com.
[01:10:48.018 --> 01:10:50.599]  That's a good search engine.
[01:10:50.599 --> 01:10:51.839]  Clergy response teams.
[01:10:54.039 --> 01:10:56.181]  He'll be watching the news clips!
[01:10:56.181 --> 01:10:59.843]  Not me saying it's bad, them saying it's good!
[01:10:59.843 --> 01:11:07.449]  Folks, are we so whacked out as a country that we don't know preachers secretly on Homeland Security payroll?
[01:11:07.449 --> 01:11:09.590]  20 plus thousand last documents we got.
[01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:18.457]  26,000 preachers and all the major denominations telling the people and then... God bless him.
[01:11:19.966 --> 01:11:28.332]  Raymond Teague, a few years ago, came into the show and he gave me the local Baptist church he was going to, a big Baptist church in Dripping Springs.
[01:11:28.332 --> 01:11:43.483]  And it said, under 501c3 rules, you are not to discuss the election, it was a midterm, 2006 coming up, and you're not to even talk about it at church dinners, or if you go with friends from church, you're not to talk about anything political.
[01:11:44.878 --> 01:11:48.784]  That is 180 degrees the opposite of this Republic!
[01:11:48.784 --> 01:11:54.672]  It's so simple, it screams out like a giant red siren!
[01:11:54.672 --> 01:11:56.856]  Oh my God, I can't believe it.
[01:11:56.856 --> 01:11:58.218]  And this is a big Baptist church.
[01:12:00.302 --> 01:12:02.683]  He gave me a copy of the document given to all the church.
[01:12:02.683 --> 01:12:06.544]  He didn't want me saying the name because, you know, he's a deacon at the church or whatever.
[01:12:06.544 --> 01:12:09.965]  But the point is, he was talking about leaving the church at the time.
[01:12:09.965 --> 01:12:11.225]  I haven't asked him about that in years.
[01:12:11.225 --> 01:12:22.128]  But the point is, he's out there and 501c3, they start it in the 50s and they tell the churches, oh, it's just a little form you sign for your tax exemption.
[01:12:22.128 --> 01:12:23.748]  See, it's a political trick.
[01:12:23.748 --> 01:12:27.009]  The First Amendment says Congress shall make no law establishing
[01:12:28.288 --> 01:12:32.431]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:33.212]  No law!
[01:12:33.212 --> 01:12:34.733]  No jurisdiction!
[01:12:34.733 --> 01:12:44.160]  Just like a cop from Orange County can't go to Schenectady, New York and give people parking tickets.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.002]  No jurisdiction!
[01:12:46.002 --> 01:12:48.644]  You don't have jurisdiction!
[01:12:48.644 --> 01:12:53.708]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:12:56.001 --> 01:13:11.193]  And then you get the faith-based initiative, and they go in and secretly recruit them for FEMA to tell their flocks to submit, and the World Council of Churches, David Rockefeller, financing the whole thing.
[01:13:11.193 --> 01:13:14.355]  I mean, that is so incredible.
[01:13:14.355 --> 01:13:15.456]  So incredible.
[01:13:16.471 --> 01:13:27.654]  And the 501c3, churches don't have to be part of that, but they sign up for it, and then now because of custom and practice, they will civilly sue you, the IRS will, and come after you.
[01:13:27.654 --> 01:13:42.678]  And so it went from, don't raise political money, don't endorse a candidate, which was a violation of the First Amendment, of course the pastors can do whatever they want, to now you don't talk about political issues, a free speech, of war.
[01:13:42.678 --> 01:13:44.159]  You don't criticize the war,
[01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:53.997]  You don't say you're against abortion, you are not allowed to have a view, and it's of the Lord to do whatever you're told, and to submit and take the shots.
[01:13:53.997 --> 01:14:03.421]  Now, if you don't know, that's Creepville, right out of Red Dawn, or right out of Body Snatchers, to have the preachers all recruited.
[01:14:03.421 --> 01:14:13.345]  And people all over, since I've been harping on this for three or four years, they go into their big church and talk to their preacher, and the preacher's like, hello Miss Mary Beth, come on in, what can the Lord do?
[01:14:14.085 --> 01:14:15.966]  Are you going to give the church a little endowment?
[01:14:15.966 --> 01:14:18.086]  I know you're quite wealthy.
[01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:24.968]  Well no, Pastor Johnson, and I've been told this story hundreds of times on-air and off-air and sent the letters and documents.
[01:14:24.968 --> 01:14:31.909]  No, Pastor Johnson, hypothetical names, I heard that FEMA's involved with the church.
[01:14:31.909 --> 01:14:33.490]  My dear, who told you that?
[01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:35.490]  You're not supposed to know about that.
[01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:37.911]  Well, there's a radio talk show host who says it
[01:14:39.198 --> 01:14:40.979]  That's classified, my dear.
[01:14:40.979 --> 01:14:47.083]  That's not something... Now, I'm gonna have to get very stern with you and ask you not to speak of this.
[01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:49.145]  That is Creepville!
[01:14:49.145 --> 01:14:50.986]  That is Nazi Germany!
[01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.947]  That is... Red Alert!
[01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:53.568]  Red Alert!
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.322]  That is a total alarm.
[01:15:02.322 --> 01:15:06.026]  That is a red-level crisis.
[01:15:06.026 --> 01:15:09.670]  Oh, and that's only one of thousands of things!
[01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:11.512]  They got local CIA.
[01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:12.232]  They got local...
[01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.630]  I don't
[01:15:31.103 --> 01:15:35.027]  They're gonna have special ops running the carbon tax police!
[01:15:35.027 --> 01:15:36.728]  I mean, this is it, folks!
[01:15:36.728 --> 01:15:37.809]  They're all over the place!
[01:15:37.809 --> 01:15:39.390]  They're on American trash!
[01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:41.612]  Bought and paid for by offshore banks!
[01:15:41.612 --> 01:15:43.113]  It's a global corporate takeover!
[01:15:43.113 --> 01:15:44.274]  They're bringing down the U.S.!
[01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:47.437]  And I've had enough of these bastards!
[01:15:47.437 --> 01:15:54.863]  And let me tell you, if somebody hadn't let you know, I'm gonna tell you right now, this is a real crisis, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:15:54.863 --> 01:15:58.986]  And they just ease it in, always upping the game, always expanding it.
[01:16:05.014 --> 01:16:06.935]  Yannick in Tennessee, finish up your point.
[01:16:06.935 --> 01:16:10.598]  Tell us about this demonic creature.
[01:16:10.598 --> 01:16:13.440]  You can even tell us the name of the church, I don't care, because I'll say it.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:21.325]  If your preacher's telling you, go ahead and take the shot, put it in the Lord's hands, don't have any thought processes, don't be involved, don't warn anybody.
[01:16:21.325 --> 01:16:26.649]  I mean, have you asked this creature if he's on FEMA payroll or, well we know,
[01:16:27.409 --> 01:16:33.917]  You know, if it's a big chain church or big denomination, we know they're on the payroll and then they just take orders.
[01:16:33.917 --> 01:16:42.927]  Describe what this creature, this Judas goat, this traitor, this demon says and does.
[01:16:42.927 --> 01:16:44.329]  I guess he doesn't want me to tell
[01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:49.071]  The, uh, church, the congregation... God forbid!
[01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:51.533]  Oh yeah, because you don't have any free speech in America!
[01:16:51.533 --> 01:16:53.274]  It's all secret police, see, now!
[01:16:53.274 --> 01:17:03.780]  Now you're like in a little secret police government-run cult, where you don't talk to outsiders about, oh, what they're... Okay, let's not say the creature's name, just tell us what he's doing.
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:14.187]  It's just, uh, don't, um, you know, not really bring corruption to the church, but it's like, let's not, let's leave that out, because God'll take care of it all.
[01:17:14.187 --> 01:17:14.467]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:15.943 --> 01:17:21.090]  It's just don't alarm the people.
[01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:22.793]  Don't scare the people.
[01:17:22.793 --> 01:17:24.295]  You know we can't leave by fare.
[01:17:26.118 --> 01:17:35.086]  I was wondering, Ken, how would I go about, I guess because I didn't have any paper or anything to show the people, like how would I go about... Ask him why God gave us spinal cords.
[01:17:35.086 --> 01:17:38.889]  Ask him why all the prophets were imprisoned or killed.
[01:17:38.889 --> 01:17:41.091]  Ask him why Jesus was crucified.
[01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:46.876]  Ask him why the whole Bible, Old and New Testament, is about being tested and standing against tyranny.
[01:17:46.876 --> 01:17:48.477]  Why were they putting the lions den?
[01:17:48.477 --> 01:17:52.040]  They should have just counted on God and said, and followed their orders.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.341]  Why were they putting the furnace?
[01:17:54.122 --> 01:17:56.963]  Why were people, why was Paul put in prison?
[01:17:56.963 --> 01:18:08.226]  Why did they crucify, I mean this is, the whole Bible's about being a watchman, protecting the little ones, standing up for widows and orphans, Jesus going in and whipping the money changers.
[01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:10.307]  I mean this guy is a devil!
[01:18:10.307 --> 01:18:17.049]  I don't know, what you do ma'am is you Google or search engine Clergy Response Teams and you print off the YouTube page
[01:18:18.516 --> 01:18:20.657]  And, in fact, put it up on screen for me right now, guys.
[01:18:20.657 --> 01:18:22.957]  I want to give her the exact headline off that YouTube page.
[01:18:22.957 --> 01:18:25.798]  Bring that to him.
[01:18:25.798 --> 01:18:28.499]  Put Clergy Response Team's InfoWars.com in.
[01:18:28.499 --> 01:18:30.399]  Print our articles about it.
[01:18:30.399 --> 01:18:32.360]  And go to Kinko's.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.740]  Bring in a hundred copies of that.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:35.481]  Give it to the whole church.
[01:18:35.481 --> 01:18:37.762]  And if he wants to kick you out, that's fine.
[01:18:37.762 --> 01:18:39.942]  But you don't put up with that.
[01:18:39.942 --> 01:18:41.463]  You're not in a cult.
[01:18:41.463 --> 01:18:44.263]  And let me tell you, that's what the government's turning all these churches into.
[01:18:44.263 --> 01:18:46.144]  Government worshiping devil cults.
[01:18:46.704 --> 01:18:48.024]  My God!
[01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:55.347]  They had this big cult leader, Pastor Hagee, write a book, he's since withdrawn it, saying Jesus wasn't the Messiah.
[01:18:55.347 --> 01:19:00.189]  Now, even if you're not a Christian, the issue is everybody knows in the Christian faith he's the Messiah.
[01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:02.869]  He called him basically an evil rebel.
[01:19:02.869 --> 01:19:05.950]  I mean, that's how warped these churches are, ma'am!
[01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:10.032]  And if your preacher starts telling you Jesus isn't Jesus, he's bad news!
[01:19:11.448 --> 01:19:15.310]  Yeah, he says that God doesn't like disobeyers.
[01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:20.212]  Like if you pay taxes, you're not supposed to... He's the word.
[01:19:20.212 --> 01:19:24.794]  You're not supposed to fight against your... because God doesn't like disobeyers.
[01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:27.695]  So the founding fathers were bad and fighting Hitler was bad.
[01:19:27.695 --> 01:19:37.680]  So basically, we should be born as jellyfish and just float around in the sea of corruption and never question government in any way and the founding fathers were basically evil.
[01:19:38.578 --> 01:19:42.642]  Look, so he uses Romans 13, Hitler's favorite quote on you?
[01:19:42.642 --> 01:19:44.244]  No, no, he hasn't used that yet.
[01:19:44.244 --> 01:19:47.528]  Because he wouldn't give me the chance to talk and explain myself.
[01:19:47.528 --> 01:19:50.090]  You know, he's just telling me everything's okay.
[01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:54.235]  Everything's okay, just give me your money.
[01:19:54.235 --> 01:19:55.496]  I mean, is this a Baptist church?
[01:19:55.496 --> 01:19:56.638]  What is this?
[01:19:56.638 --> 01:19:58.259]  No, it's a Christian church.
[01:19:58.259 --> 01:19:59.761]  It's here in Knoxville.
[01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:00.482]  Stay there in Knoxville.
[01:20:02.719 --> 01:20:04.221]  Recognize that sound?
[01:20:04.221 --> 01:20:09.005]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are ending up.
[01:20:09.005 --> 01:20:11.448]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[01:20:11.448 --> 01:20:16.773]  According to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[01:20:16.773 --> 01:20:22.179]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[01:20:22.179 --> 01:20:25.242]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[01:20:25.282 --> 01:20:25.882]  Let's do it!
[01:20:50.067 --> 01:20:53.291]  Isn't it time you stop flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[01:20:53.291 --> 01:20:54.492]  1-800-210-1922 or go to orderchoose.com
[01:21:02.651 --> 01:21:05.014]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[01:21:05.014 --> 01:21:11.260]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:15.385]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of The International Forecaster.
[01:21:15.385 --> 01:21:22.232]  When you subscribe to The International Forecaster, you get Robert Chapman's 45 years of experience and concise investment recommendations.
[01:21:22.552 --> 01:21:23.193]  We're good to go.
[01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.951]  Thanks for watching.
[01:22:01.454 --> 01:22:07.257]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.257 --> 01:22:14.840]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:21.003]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:21.443 --> 01:22:23.404]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:23.404 --> 01:22:25.904]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:25.904 --> 01:22:37.467]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:22:37.467 --> 01:22:39.147]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.147 --> 01:22:41.008]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:22:41.008 --> 01:22:47.249]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.913 --> 01:22:56.179]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:56.179 --> 01:22:57.760]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.782]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.782 --> 01:23:06.186]  If you'd like to quit smoking regular cigarettes and try a revolutionary new alternative, this might be the most important
[01:23:11.664 --> 01:23:11.904]  I think so.
[01:23:26.755 --> 01:23:27.235]  We're good to go.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:55.942]  Don't want no shackles Don't want no shackles on me
[01:24:22.719 --> 01:24:25.541]  Don't want no shackles.
[01:24:25.541 --> 01:24:28.244]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:24:28.244 --> 01:24:29.765]  You know what I'm doing during the breaks here?
[01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:35.750]  I'm on different radio shows doing little 3-4 minute plugs, exposing the swine flu as a fraud.
[01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:37.591]  I'm fighting these bastards as hard as I can.
[01:24:37.591 --> 01:24:47.459]  Alright ma'am, I start hyperventilating and just the treason of these slime bag, oily, limp-wristed, weak, I don't want to call it effeminate.
[01:24:48.257 --> 01:24:49.902]  But, you know, it's like men that act like women.
[01:24:49.902 --> 01:24:52.170]  It's not putting women down.
[01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:52.972]  It's not womanly.
[01:24:52.972 --> 01:24:54.216]  It's disgusting.
[01:24:55.438 --> 01:25:08.347]  They're always the same with their little tie pins, little glitter bugs, up there pimping around, and they're worldly, they love the flesh, they love power, they just want to keep their whorehouse going, they just want to keep getting your money, keep suppressing you.
[01:25:08.347 --> 01:25:16.113]  They've been told by those that run the higher level church, you know, just keep the slaves in line, you can keep sucking their money.
[01:25:16.113 --> 01:25:18.614]  And they're total pimps of the government.
[01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:23.238]  So, I mean, is this a part of a larger chain of churches, or is this a stand-alone pimp
[01:25:25.509 --> 01:25:27.931]  It's a stand-alone church.
[01:25:27.931 --> 01:25:35.617]  But what I'm really worried about is the people there, because once the pastor says something, it's like the news, once the news says something, everyone believes.
[01:25:35.617 --> 01:25:37.399]  And it's just so hard to wake the people up.
[01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:38.880]  They don't know about false prophets?
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.824]  Get the passages about false prophets that won't warn the people and lead them to destruction.
[01:25:44.994 --> 01:25:51.659]  Look, look, I would go in there with a bunch of printouts and things and I would educate people and make them kick you out of the church.
[01:25:51.659 --> 01:25:54.320]  But that's a worthless church to be at.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.763]  How many people are there being mind-numbed by this glitter bug?
[01:25:58.763 --> 01:26:01.105]  Well, it's two services, so it's probably about maybe 150-200.
[01:26:04.261 --> 01:26:16.573]  Well, ma'am, you can go to YouTube, 60 Minutes Swine Flu Vaccine Warning, and you can show them 60 minutes about how the last time they did this, it killed a bunch of people.
[01:26:16.573 --> 01:26:17.935]  And, of course, that's the whole plan.
[01:26:17.935 --> 01:26:22.519]  You can also print off Gardasil killing people and say, no!
[01:26:22.519 --> 01:26:23.140]  No!
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:24.201]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:24.201 --> 01:26:24.962]  It's good to hear from you.
[01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:27.302]  I'm out of control today.
[01:26:27.302 --> 01:26:28.743]  It's just I can't handle it anymore.
[01:26:28.743 --> 01:26:30.784]  David in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:26:30.784 --> 01:26:32.245]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[01:26:32.245 --> 01:26:34.207]  Stephen Harper, Batman.
[01:26:34.207 --> 01:26:39.310]  I had a question, it was a concern, and I'd like to introduce this with a quote from Jordan Maxwell.
[01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:42.712]  The elites are a lot of things, but stupid is not one of them.
[01:26:42.712 --> 01:26:55.241]  So my question being, with the elites allowing information to leak in the mainstream media, admitting that the Federal Reserve and the bailout are a scam, and Ron Paul's bill gaining momentum in the House,
[01:26:57.537 --> 01:27:02.919]  If you audit the Fed, won't that crash the American economy and isn't that an endgame?
[01:27:02.919 --> 01:27:06.781]  So my question is, what is the next step after auditing the Fed?
[01:27:06.781 --> 01:27:07.801]  What do we do from there?
[01:27:07.801 --> 01:27:09.002]  Well, that's a great question.
[01:27:09.002 --> 01:27:10.883]  I'm going to put you on hold and answer it and then come back to you.
[01:27:10.883 --> 01:27:17.626]  Look, justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[01:27:17.626 --> 01:27:21.968]  The mother of all evil is this lesser of two evils or compromise idea.
[01:27:24.361 --> 01:27:31.106]  And once you start saying, well, we better not audit it, because we'll get something worse, or we better not audit it, because they'll crash the economy.
[01:27:31.106 --> 01:27:33.207]  Yeah!
[01:27:33.207 --> 01:27:38.791]  And if a bully comes up and starts ordering you to give them their lunch money, you might get your nose broken.
[01:27:38.791 --> 01:27:42.674]  But it's better to just go ahead and get into it with a bully than live as a slave.
[01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:47.617]  And the truth is, most bullies are cowards.
[01:27:47.617 --> 01:27:50.319]  And you're going to find out who you are by going through that stress.
[01:27:51.877 --> 01:27:54.798]  And so absolutely, they'll probably set a nuke off in a major city.
[01:27:54.798 --> 01:27:56.619]  They might release a bioweapon.
[01:27:56.619 --> 01:27:58.700]  But they're going to do it down the road anyways.
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:03.202]  We might as well put it on our timetable, in our battlefield, on our terms.
[01:28:03.202 --> 01:28:06.244]  You got it?
[01:28:06.244 --> 01:28:10.146]  And so, we educate people how they stage terror attacks.
[01:28:10.146 --> 01:28:12.847]  We educate people how they engage in financial terrorism.
[01:28:12.847 --> 01:28:16.689]  We educate people how back in October, they were getting 1,000 to 1 phone calls.
[01:28:16.689 --> 01:28:18.810]  You heard Congressman Gohmert saying he was getting 2,000 to 1 phone calls.
[01:28:20.387 --> 01:28:39.424]  And then after they plunged the stock market 777 points by design with the Plunge Protection Team not pumping it up and the President and his minions bad-mouthing it, then they were getting what he said about two calls for every couple hundred for it.
[01:28:39.424 --> 01:28:40.085]  So it went from 2,000 against
[01:28:43.373 --> 01:28:45.695]  You know, less than 1 out of 100 against.
[01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:47.577]  But still, that was the big swing.
[01:28:47.577 --> 01:28:50.239]  My God, we got maybe 1% for the government now.
[01:28:50.239 --> 01:28:54.002]  All these greedy yuppies going, I want 9401K to go back up.
[01:28:54.002 --> 01:28:57.305]  I guess give the bankers all the money then, let them bankrupt everything.
[01:28:57.305 --> 01:28:58.706]  It's financial terrorism.
[01:28:58.706 --> 01:29:01.708]  They gave their lunch money to the bully.
[01:29:01.708 --> 01:29:04.531]  And you know, I got beat up by bullies a few times until I finally found out.
[01:29:04.531 --> 01:29:10.696]  It's just, it's good to go ahead and... When they're sitting there putting their hands on your shoulders trying to scare you, go ahead and headbutt them.
[01:29:13.393 --> 01:29:21.596]  And if they're three times, you know, your size or whatever, when they get you down on the ground, just go ahead and bite into their leg.
[01:29:21.596 --> 01:29:22.177]  You know?
[01:29:22.177 --> 01:29:23.817]  And you can bite people really hard, folks.
[01:29:23.817 --> 01:29:24.758]  Most people have inhibition.
[01:29:24.758 --> 01:29:26.799]  You can just bite a huge chunk out of somebody.
[01:29:26.799 --> 01:29:28.319]  Oh, I'm 12 years old.
[01:29:28.319 --> 01:29:30.580]  You know, three guys are beating me up on top of me.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.601]  I'm just gonna go, oh, this leg looks good.
[01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:34.122]  Oh, there's blood everywhere.
[01:29:34.122 --> 01:29:36.743]  Oh, you guys are crying now.
[01:29:36.743 --> 01:29:36.963]  You know?
[01:29:37.961 --> 01:29:39.362]  That's how it works with these bastards.
[01:29:39.362 --> 01:29:40.862]  Okay, you're gonna try something more?
[01:29:40.862 --> 01:29:41.783]  Let's go!
[01:29:41.783 --> 01:29:43.784]  Let's go, you murderin' bankers!
[01:29:43.784 --> 01:29:44.344]  Look, stay there.
[01:29:44.344 --> 01:29:51.367]  I'm gonna explain this when we get back.
[01:29:51.367 --> 01:29:52.768]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.768 --> 01:29:55.289]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.990]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.794 --> 01:30:02.176]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.176 --> 01:30:04.178]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:30:04.178 --> 01:30:05.159]  Well, you should.
[01:30:05.159 --> 01:30:09.664]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:30:09.664 --> 01:30:10.465]  That's right.
[01:30:10.465 --> 01:30:19.134]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[01:30:19.134 --> 01:30:20.476]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[01:30:20.476 --> 01:30:21.617]  Plus, if you act fast.
[01:30:21.817 --> 01:30:27.802]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:30:27.802 --> 01:30:34.707]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:30:34.707 --> 01:30:39.891]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[01:30:40.211 --> 01:30:41.673]  This is real.
[01:30:41.673 --> 01:30:42.734]  Don't miss out.
[01:30:42.734 --> 01:30:51.302]  Secure a Front Sight Defensive Handgun Course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[01:30:51.302 --> 01:30:53.664]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[01:30:53.664 --> 01:30:57.368]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T dot com.
[01:30:57.368 --> 01:31:00.271]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[01:31:01.101 --> 01:31:02.782]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:02.782 --> 01:31:07.523]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:31:07.523 --> 01:31:10.484]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:31:10.484 --> 01:31:13.525]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:31:13.525 --> 01:31:18.247]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:31:18.407 --> 01:31:18.647]  We're good.
[01:31:38.266 --> 01:31:44.531]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-scribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:31:44.531 --> 01:31:48.295]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:48.295 --> 01:31:49.836]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.836 --> 01:31:50.276]  Take action today.
[01:31:50.276 --> 01:31:52.098]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:32:01.169 --> 01:32:08.556]  As you already know, drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:13.220]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:18.085]  Alkavision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[01:32:18.445 --> 01:32:26.168]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:32:26.168 --> 01:32:30.730]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:36.932]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:32:36.932 --> 01:32:42.915]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[01:32:42.915 --> 01:32:48.197]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[01:32:48.477 --> 01:32:52.324]  That's ALKAVision.com or by calling 269-216-9767.
[01:32:52.324 --> 01:32:53.045]  That's 269-216-9767 today!
[01:33:25.512 --> 01:33:37.515]  Look, nine times out of ten, the fight goes to who wants it the most.
[01:33:37.515 --> 01:33:42.437]  And, if we just commit to bring down the Globals, they can be beaten.
[01:33:44.232 --> 01:33:59.240]  But regardless, we have a job to do fighting evil, and it's going to be a lot worse on us rolling over to these people, and they don't respect us, and they think we're a bunch of mesmerized, pop-controlled, popular-culture-controlled idiots.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:02.802]  And they are euthanizing us, they are carrying out eugenics against us.
[01:34:02.802 --> 01:34:12.947]  I've got three different mainstream news articles a day with mainstream news and government calling for not giving old people medical care, and selling the public, training the public
[01:34:13.843 --> 01:34:19.229]  About, oh, there's not going to be enough flu shots for the old, only the young will get it.
[01:34:19.229 --> 01:34:20.590]  And that does a lot of things.
[01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:25.916]  It creates the illusion that the shot is something special that people are fighting over.
[01:34:25.916 --> 01:34:29.640]  I call it the Christmas toy scenario.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.022]  And that also it's something that's good.
[01:34:32.022 --> 01:34:35.326]  And it also plays old off against young, young off against old.
[01:34:39.292 --> 01:34:44.734]  And it sets the precedent that the old don't get taken care of.
[01:34:44.734 --> 01:34:47.916]  See, somebody will read one of these articles and take it on face value.
[01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:57.119]  Oh, look, this article here in the Associated Press, guaranteed written by propagandists as I read it, the average person reads it and, oh my gosh, I better get out and get one of those shots.
[01:34:57.119 --> 01:34:58.840]  Only certain people are getting it.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.461]  And they'll always put out fake newscasts.
[01:35:00.461 --> 01:35:02.581]  Oh, there's shortages of flu shots this year.
[01:35:02.581 --> 01:35:07.543]  Then later I read how the companies couldn't sell one-tenth of it and nobody's taking it.
[01:35:07.543 --> 01:35:08.884]  So they're having this fear-mongering.
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:19.308]  You know, it came out back in the 80s and 90s that they would make a children's movie just to sell the toy.
[01:35:19.308 --> 01:35:26.213]  I saw a number back in the late 90s in Time Magazine when Star Wars was being re-released.
[01:35:26.213 --> 01:35:27.935]  The first three.
[01:35:27.935 --> 01:35:32.899]  And how George Lucas had made like $6 billion on toys and $1 billion on the movies.
[01:35:32.899 --> 01:35:35.000]  I know it's gotta be a lot more than that now.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.823]  But the point is, they'll have a Christmas toy.
[01:35:39.079 --> 01:35:47.391]  And they'll have five or six, seven big Hollywood production houses will make a movie just over a toy.
[01:35:47.391 --> 01:35:53.339]  Schwarzenegger and Jingle all the way admitted that they made a movie about the turbo doll, the turbo man.
[01:35:54.898 --> 01:35:59.980]  Just for Christmas, just to have that toy in stores.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:02.981]  And the whole movie is about running around looking for the toy.
[01:36:02.981 --> 01:36:04.082]  And it worked!
[01:36:04.082 --> 01:36:05.542]  It was one of the hit toys that year.
[01:36:05.542 --> 01:36:10.724]  Everybody ran out and did what they saw Schwarzenegger in October, November, December doing.
[01:36:10.724 --> 01:36:12.985]  Their kids had to have the Turbo Man doll.
[01:36:14.312 --> 01:36:16.953]  They do the same thing with the vaccine!
[01:36:16.953 --> 01:36:19.975]  But see, when I read an article, just all the data, like, flicks up.
[01:36:19.975 --> 01:36:23.837]  I understand the paradigms, the programs, the operations, the tricks.
[01:36:23.837 --> 01:36:27.739]  And you can tell if a reporter's just a mainline reporter, or you can tell if it's an operative.
[01:36:27.739 --> 01:36:34.382]  New York Times, Wall Street Journal, AP, Reuters, you're seeing operatives using psych warfare tricks.
[01:36:34.382 --> 01:36:38.344]  You read some local newspaper guy, it's not the same.
[01:36:38.344 --> 01:36:43.207]  He'll just kind of regurgitate the mass mind control, the understood propaganda.
[01:36:47.253 --> 01:36:50.937]  They're just regurgitating what the higher-ups say who are operatives.
[01:36:50.937 --> 01:36:52.318]  It's compartmentalization.
[01:36:52.318 --> 01:36:54.220]  They just become repeaters.
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:55.741]  They're like a radio station repeater.
[01:36:55.741 --> 01:37:05.290]  You know, they can send a radio signal around the country with a few dozen linked up four or five watt transmitters because they bounce them from transmitter to transmitter.
[01:37:05.290 --> 01:37:06.371]  They just repeat.
[01:37:06.371 --> 01:37:08.353]  They just regurgitate like a parrot.
[01:37:08.353 --> 01:37:10.075]  A parrot doesn't really talk.
[01:37:10.075 --> 01:37:11.276]  It just repeats what it heard.
[01:37:14.272 --> 01:37:15.592]  Obama!
[01:37:15.592 --> 01:37:17.333]  Obama!
[01:37:17.333 --> 01:37:25.275]  So, the caller I'm about to go back to, great question, Swat, love taking your calls, David, you know, is asking, well, what do we do?
[01:37:25.275 --> 01:37:28.456]  You know, the elites are smart and, you know, why are they allowing this?
[01:37:28.456 --> 01:37:31.516]  Because they can't, they've been ignoring for decades.
[01:37:31.516 --> 01:37:41.579]  Well, while we've been out, G. Edward Griffin and countless others, for decades, and Bob Chapman and just Bill, Bob Benson and
[01:37:44.275 --> 01:37:49.298]  There's Bill Benson, the law that ever was, and Red Beckman, and countless others.
[01:37:49.298 --> 01:37:53.521]  Anthony Hilder.
[01:37:53.521 --> 01:37:54.462]  Eustace Mullins.
[01:37:54.462 --> 01:37:59.025]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[01:37:59.025 --> 01:38:00.946]  I know I'm forgetting a bunch of them.
[01:38:00.946 --> 01:38:02.987]  Warning people about the private Fed that took over 1913.
[01:38:05.393 --> 01:38:10.879]  And now, the Fed is openly running everything, stolen $23.7 trillion.
[01:38:10.879 --> 01:38:13.481]  You bet there's going to be a backlash against that.
[01:38:13.481 --> 01:38:22.490]  And you're right, they can try something like changing the name or, quote, reforming the Fed and making it more about the IMF.
[01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:28.776]  And that's been their plan, is as the World Bank and Federal Reserve get exposed, moving it to their left hand.
[01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:32.340]  And that's even broken up into right-wing and left-wing paradigm.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:39.968]  The World Bank and Federal Reserve are seen as more right-wing, more Anglo-American, British U.S., and then the IMF's more European, Japanese.
[01:38:39.968 --> 01:38:42.871]  It's all bull.
[01:38:42.871 --> 01:38:48.918]  And the Trilateral Commission was publicly set up to create this false dichotomy, and they wrote publications bragging about it.
[01:38:50.046 --> 01:38:57.672]  And they give you a fake left-wing version of the UN, and a fake right-wing version, and a fake right-wing split and left-wing split in NATO.
[01:38:57.672 --> 01:38:59.514]  It's all about false choices.
[01:38:59.514 --> 01:39:09.102]  It's the elites managing us.
[01:39:09.102 --> 01:39:09.322]  So...
[01:39:14.022 --> 01:39:14.663]  I mean, what do you do?
[01:39:14.663 --> 01:39:15.624]  Just let the Federal Reserve?
[01:39:15.624 --> 01:39:16.344]  No.
[01:39:16.344 --> 01:39:19.307]  Regardless, they can play a few more tricks.
[01:39:19.307 --> 01:39:20.508]  They can juke.
[01:39:20.508 --> 01:39:22.390]  They can jive.
[01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:25.653]  They can jump back and forth and zig and zag.
[01:39:25.653 --> 01:39:32.500]  They can have the Senate block the investigation.
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:35.002]  They can have the Senate block an audit.
[01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:36.063]  Ron Paul said it here.
[01:39:36.063 --> 01:39:36.944]  Good!
[01:39:36.944 --> 01:39:38.346]  It only makes it that much bigger!
[01:39:39.923 --> 01:39:42.444]  You know, the media for months and months has tried to ignore this.
[01:39:42.444 --> 01:39:51.070]  They weren't talking about this six months ago when we were having rallies and demonstrations and the army was spying on us and DHS reports were being written saying we're terrorists.
[01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:53.051]  They failed!
[01:39:53.051 --> 01:40:05.238]  They went and told all the police we were terrorists and now it's on every nightly news channel and the biggest issue, even though they try to divert us with, you know, the black professor cop story with Obama.
[01:40:08.582 --> 01:40:10.627]  We're setting the agenda.
[01:40:10.627 --> 01:40:15.457]  They try to set the agenda with cosmetic shows and shows about the rich and famous.
[01:40:17.352 --> 01:40:24.596]  First Madison Avenue tries to make you feel insecure and makes you try to feel bad about yourself so you socially never mature.
[01:40:24.596 --> 01:40:26.717]  You're supposed to be insecure when you're 12, 14 years old.
[01:40:26.717 --> 01:40:28.157]  You're finding your identity.
[01:40:28.157 --> 01:40:30.939]  You're supposed to go through trials and tribulations and become confident.
[01:40:30.939 --> 01:40:39.883]  They want to forever freeze us in an insecure juvenile mode so that we're afraid of what people think about us and afraid of what people will say.
[01:40:39.883 --> 01:40:43.625]  So we'll just dress and talk how the TV says and pick a click
[01:40:44.145 --> 01:40:59.191]  One of the controlled niches or subgroups, subcultures, and just be part of that and all kind of nest in a group, all trying to fit in because they made us insecure.
[01:40:59.191 --> 01:41:05.094]  And the churches have been bought and paid for to twist the Bible to say it's the end of the world and lay down the government and...
[01:41:06.044 --> 01:41:12.966]  Go along with what you're told to do, and then the secular people can't wake up to this whole Mark of the Beast system?
[01:41:12.966 --> 01:41:22.510]  I mean, even if you're not a Christian, is it good to have the government tracking and tracing everything you buy, sell, and do, and controlling you, and saying they're going to control your behavior with carbon taxes, with the tracking system?
[01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:28.211]  I told you nine, ten years ago they would do that with the carbon tax, and with the Cashless Society, and now they've announced it?
[01:41:28.211 --> 01:41:31.012]  Because I was reading their policy reports!
[01:41:31.012 --> 01:41:32.493]  This is really happening!
[01:41:35.003 --> 01:41:37.484]  People always marvel that I know what's going to happen.
[01:41:37.484 --> 01:41:39.926]  Most of this stuff's public!
[01:41:39.926 --> 01:41:43.367]  They've written hundreds of textbooks bragging about it.
[01:41:43.367 --> 01:41:48.550]  I mean, I got their playbook.
[01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:54.753]  When we're fourth and down and past the 20, we're going to go with this formation.
[01:41:54.753 --> 01:41:56.494]  We're going to go with this run.
[01:41:56.494 --> 01:41:57.875]  We're going to do this with the quarterback.
[01:41:57.875 --> 01:41:59.416]  We're going to do this with the running back.
[01:41:59.416 --> 01:42:01.517]  I mean, I've got their entire playbook.
[01:42:03.106 --> 01:42:07.089]  It's as if I've been sitting in on all the coaches' meetings for twenty years.
[01:42:07.089 --> 01:42:15.195]  I know exactly what they're going to do, exactly what's going on, and it's like being in a car.
[01:42:15.195 --> 01:42:28.166]  It's like being in a car with a maniac driving it, and you know that they're going down a long road, they're going 150 miles an hour, and you start telling them, hey, right over this hill, I've been this way a hundred times,
[01:42:29.997 --> 01:42:36.681]  Right over this hill it takes a quick left and it goes from a 60 to 70 mile an hour to a 30 mile an hour turn.
[01:42:36.681 --> 01:42:39.122]  We're going to fly off the road.
[01:42:39.122 --> 01:42:41.103]  We're going to fly off the road and die.
[01:42:43.114 --> 01:42:44.054]  There's a cliff.
[01:42:44.054 --> 01:42:46.195]  It makes a turn into a canyon.
[01:42:46.195 --> 01:42:47.475]  You've got to slow down.
[01:42:47.475 --> 01:42:52.417]  And they're just laughing at you, and laughing at you, and you try to go up and warn them, and they laugh at you.
[01:42:52.417 --> 01:42:53.077]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:42:53.077 --> 01:42:56.578]  You've still got to warn them, because you're still stuck in the car with these maniacs.
[01:42:56.578 --> 01:43:10.783]  You're still stuck in the car with a bunch of narcissistic, stupid, weak, cowardly people who have been mesmerized, scientifically turned into arrested development, gibbering cowards.
[01:43:12.773 --> 01:43:16.575]  And let me tell you, as stuff gets worse, a lot of people are going to wake up.
[01:43:16.575 --> 01:43:25.400]  But when it really gets bad, a lot of them are going to turn on us and decide through cowardice and through the Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.640]  Print Stockholm Syndrome for me.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:28.041]  I want the exact definition.
[01:43:28.041 --> 01:43:33.264]  You know, that's where you turn to your kidnappers and love them, turn to your torturer and love them.
[01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:36.771]  And your mind does double-think.
[01:43:36.771 --> 01:43:38.153]  Your mind does crime-stopping.
[01:43:38.153 --> 01:43:38.853]  Orwellian.
[01:43:38.853 --> 01:43:45.119]  You really decide to like the guy that's had you locked up in a barn for six months raping you.
[01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:46.240]  And pulling your toenails out.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.761]  You start worshipping them.
[01:43:47.761 --> 01:43:50.864]  That's what the average weak person does.
[01:43:50.864 --> 01:43:53.106]  Even the strongest people start doing that.
[01:43:53.106 --> 01:43:54.768]  Well, not me!
[01:43:54.768 --> 01:43:56.830]  I know what you are, scum!
[01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:58.932]  I know what you are, New World Order sadist!
[01:44:00.305 --> 01:44:06.047]  And I know you're jacking with the air and water and bragging about it, you little power-tripping bastards.
[01:44:06.047 --> 01:44:12.710]  I got some raw video sent to me of Holdren in a White House press briefing shot by some news people.
[01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:16.492]  And it's just the side discussions and the look on his face.
[01:44:16.492 --> 01:44:20.133]  That son of a bitch is on a power trip from hell.
[01:44:20.133 --> 01:44:23.155]  And let me tell you something, he's dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:23.155 --> 01:44:26.556]  And I'm not risking my life to take this murderer on for nothing.
[01:44:26.556 --> 01:44:28.477]  I want to take action against these people.
[01:44:29.755 --> 01:44:30.816]  And you bet they're murderers.
[01:44:30.816 --> 01:44:37.340]  First thing they did was release the funding and then double it for abortions and forced infanticide all over the world.
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.201]  Mainstream news.
[01:44:40.330 --> 01:44:51.834]  Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological response sometimes seen in abductee and hostages in which the hostage showed signs of loyalty to the hostage taker, regardless of the danger or risk in which they have been placed.
[01:44:51.834 --> 01:44:55.695]  See, and they do that because it's make-believe.
[01:44:55.695 --> 01:44:56.435]  And they've done studies.
[01:44:56.435 --> 01:44:59.116]  They've found that Stockholm Syndrome is getting more and more common.
[01:44:59.116 --> 01:45:01.317]  People a hundred years ago didn't behave like this on average.
[01:45:01.977 --> 01:45:02.998]  But they're delusional.
[01:45:02.998 --> 01:45:05.079]  It's a TV make-believe world.
[01:45:05.079 --> 01:45:10.562]  They think that if they decide to like the person, pulling their toenails out, that it makes it okay.
[01:45:10.562 --> 01:45:12.923]  And they even start liking it!
[01:45:12.923 --> 01:45:17.286]  Just exactly what one of the top globalists, Aldous Huxley, said.
[01:45:17.286 --> 01:45:22.769]  He said, people can be made to love their servitude.
[01:45:22.769 --> 01:45:31.334]  The syndrome is named after the normal Strauburg robbery
[01:45:32.631 --> 01:45:38.774]  In Stockholm, Sweden, in which the bank robbers held bank employees hostage August 23rd to 2873.
[01:45:38.774 --> 01:45:46.898]  In the case, the victims became emotionally attached to their victimizers and even defended their captors after they were freed from the six-day ordeal.
[01:45:46.898 --> 01:45:51.400]  The term Stockholm Syndrome was coined by the criminologist and psychiatrist Niles
[01:45:52.628 --> 01:45:58.672]  Burgroth, and I agree it's a real syndrome, who assisted the police during a robbery and referred to the syndrome in a news broadcast.
[01:45:58.672 --> 01:45:59.252]  Yeah.
[01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:06.037]  Now what that is, is you take warlike, intelligent, dynamic Swedes and you domesticate them in a socialist system.
[01:46:07.406 --> 01:46:14.648]  And you make serving the oppressors and the boss your religion, your cultural identity, and then it turns in on itself.
[01:46:14.648 --> 01:46:17.408]  And look, we serve the corrupt police, the corrupt government.
[01:46:17.408 --> 01:46:28.511]  You got New Jersey with all these mayors and hundreds of officials now in body organs, snatching and selling out of China and other places and stealing money and charities.
[01:46:28.511 --> 01:46:30.652]  That's how the whole government works!
[01:46:30.652 --> 01:46:31.652]  Every major town!
[01:46:32.032 --> 01:46:33.213]  Every major city.
[01:46:33.213 --> 01:46:35.375]  They run child kidnapping.
[01:46:35.375 --> 01:46:38.957]  The government is pure evil!
[01:46:38.957 --> 01:46:41.479]  Pure evil!
[01:46:41.479 --> 01:46:44.521]  We passed the tipping point probably five, six years ago.
[01:46:44.521 --> 01:46:48.224]  Because see, first evil creeps in, hides, recruits more of its people in.
[01:46:53.251 --> 01:46:58.996]  That's why in corporations, I've been reading corporate handbooks and things trying to figure out how to protect my operation.
[01:46:58.996 --> 01:47:02.759]  They say don't hire people who have friends, then hire their friends and hire groups.
[01:47:02.759 --> 01:47:04.761]  That's how people can infiltrate.
[01:47:04.761 --> 01:47:09.105]  That's how in Europe, it's only masons that are hired now as judges and barristers.
[01:47:09.105 --> 01:47:10.506]  They won't let you in.
[01:47:10.506 --> 01:47:13.609]  See, that's how any good ol' boy system works.
[01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:18.633]  And folks, they have done nothing but brought their people in now.
[01:47:18.633 --> 01:47:19.955]  And they run the show!
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:28.225]  And they're going to take your kids, and they're going to do medical experiments on them, and they're going to take your kids and they're going to rape them!
[01:47:28.225 --> 01:47:29.926]  Because they like to!
[01:47:29.926 --> 01:47:36.071]  And they're going to take your organs, and they're going to put crap in your water, because they like it, because they're psychopaths, folks.
[01:47:36.071 --> 01:47:37.452]  They enjoy it!
[01:47:37.452 --> 01:47:47.740]  You want to go out and go bass fishing, you want to go out and start a fire, and make a bowl of chili, and hang out with your buddies and eat some crackers, or go out and, you know, clean your gun and shoot it, or you want to go bowling?
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:48.881]  Well, you're a normal person.
[01:47:51.704 --> 01:48:03.033]  See, you're a good person, but you have a weak spot, you have a blind spot, you don't know how to recognize evil when it's right in your face, and so these bastards have gotten in control, and they've taken over the entire society!
[01:48:03.033 --> 01:48:06.496]  We're now a tyranny!
[01:48:06.496 --> 01:48:13.321]  And I'll tell you why I'm still alive, because they don't want to underline, they don't want to highlight everything I've said and done, because I'm so on target, it scares them.
[01:48:13.321 --> 01:48:16.664]  And to me, I'm like a monster in the forest to them.
[01:48:16.664 --> 01:48:18.586]  To the monsters, I'm a monster.
[01:48:18.586 --> 01:48:19.987]  You understand that from their perspective?
[01:48:21.269 --> 01:48:27.181]  I'm like some giant roving bear and they just want to stay out of my way.
[01:48:27.181 --> 01:48:31.369]  Because they actually respect strength and courage.
[01:48:33.371 --> 01:48:38.952]  They detest you that grovel and smile at them and think it's cute.
[01:48:38.952 --> 01:48:41.413]  Stop being cowardly followers.
[01:48:41.413 --> 01:48:45.074]  Stop... Look, I don't care what they do with the Federal Reserve.
[01:48:45.074 --> 01:48:48.535]  I am in a ship ramming speed.
[01:48:48.535 --> 01:48:50.035]  I'm out of torpedoes.
[01:48:50.035 --> 01:48:51.375]  I'm out of rockets.
[01:48:51.375 --> 01:48:52.956]  I'm in the info war.
[01:48:52.956 --> 01:48:56.437]  I am in full throttle and I'm ramming them.
[01:48:56.437 --> 01:48:57.477]  I'm trying to ram
[01:48:59.383 --> 01:49:05.325]  Their rudder, I'm trying to ram their propulsion system, their propellers.
[01:49:05.325 --> 01:49:10.847]  I'm running up on them from the side, trying to hit them right in the weak spot to knock them out.
[01:49:10.847 --> 01:49:22.692]  And I know that, I mean, it's a good, primitive, spiritual place to be to tell these murdering scumbag bullies, I don't care what you do to me, I'm going up against you!
[01:49:24.264 --> 01:49:26.525]  Smash me deader than a pancake!
[01:49:26.525 --> 01:49:28.026]  You have done me a favor!
[01:49:28.026 --> 01:49:33.069]  You just watered the tree of liberty and it's gonna grow big old branches and gonna rip your head off!
[01:49:33.069 --> 01:49:33.810]  I don't die!
[01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:36.291]  I go on to the next people that stand up!
[01:49:36.291 --> 01:49:38.152]  I go on through my red blood!
[01:49:38.152 --> 01:49:40.434]  You sons of bitches have been beaten!
[01:49:40.434 --> 01:49:41.734]  God has beaten you!
[01:49:41.734 --> 01:49:42.915]  Love has beaten you!
[01:49:42.915 --> 01:49:44.596]  Honorableness has beaten you!
[01:49:44.596 --> 01:49:46.297]  And you lost from the beginning!
[01:49:46.297 --> 01:49:48.098]  From the foundations of the world!
[01:49:48.098 --> 01:49:50.920]  You are hells and that's where you're going!
[01:49:52.179 --> 01:49:55.380]  You know, they say hell is just a word, and that's true, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:50:01.462]  I've looked into these people's minds, and let me tell you, I've been there, I've seen what they are, I know what they are!
[01:50:01.462 --> 01:50:08.424]  And I came back from their world, their dimension, and I'll tell you what they are, and I see them!
[01:50:08.584 --> 01:50:31.630]  And I see their designs, I see their language, I see their symbols, I see their programs, I understand everything they're doing, I know who they are, I know who their sub-minions are, I know what their entire pivotal structure is, and I'm telling you, if you've got any common sense and any soul, you will do everything in your power to resist the New World Order and the lovers of death.
[01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:42.892]  The worshippers of death, the forces of hell are being released on this country and this world and it's happening because the churches are the front line!
[01:50:42.892 --> 01:50:47.473]  And you want to go in there and listen to those ring races and those pulpits, those whores of the New World Order?
[01:50:47.473 --> 01:50:52.554]  You go ahead, but I'm telling you, I'm not worried about people that can kill my body.
[01:50:52.554 --> 01:50:56.894]  I'm only worried about those that can get my soul and kill my soul.
[01:50:56.894 --> 01:50:59.835]  And so I'm beyond them because I know where my soul is.
[01:51:01.397 --> 01:51:02.078]  You worry.
[01:51:02.078 --> 01:51:04.421]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:51:04.421 --> 01:51:04.982]  Hi.
[01:51:04.982 --> 01:51:07.766]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:51:07.766 --> 01:51:12.313]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:51:12.313 --> 01:51:14.776]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:51:14.776 --> 01:51:17.821]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:51:18.121 --> 01:51:20.042]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:51:20.042 --> 01:51:22.844]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:51:22.844 --> 01:51:26.567]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:51:26.567 --> 01:51:30.970]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:51:30.970 --> 01:51:35.073]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:51:35.073 --> 01:51:41.397]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:51:41.397 --> 01:51:43.759]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:51:43.759 --> 01:51:45.400]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:50.521]  So go to offthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:51:50.521 --> 01:51:51.422]  Start now.
[01:51:51.422 --> 01:51:53.142]  Knowledge is power.
[01:51:53.142 --> 01:51:54.142]  Better take action.
[01:51:54.142 --> 01:52:01.745]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:52:01.745 --> 01:52:03.165]  It is a big idea.
[01:52:03.165 --> 01:52:05.986]  A new world order.
[01:52:05.986 --> 01:52:10.307]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:52:10.874 --> 01:52:13.697]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:52:13.697 --> 01:52:16.479]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:52:16.479 --> 01:52:19.662]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:52:19.662 --> 01:52:30.032]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:52:30.032 --> 01:52:34.977]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:52:35.467 --> 01:52:40.291]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to
[01:53:08.916 --> 01:53:09.556]  We're good to go!
[01:53:32.534 --> 01:53:32.954]  We're good to go.
[01:54:17.307 --> 01:54:20.951]  Every single day.
[01:54:53.345 --> 01:54:54.746]  Alright, I'm going to go back to David.
[01:54:54.746 --> 01:55:03.129]  I answered his question with a 20 minute rant, then Joel, Shirley, Matt and others.
[01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:05.690]  Alright, we've got a guest coming up too.
[01:55:05.690 --> 01:55:08.391]  Dealing with this weird Republican secret society.
[01:55:08.391 --> 01:55:15.493]  I saw it on CNN, MSNBC, they call it the family, they've really been hyping it.
[01:55:15.493 --> 01:55:20.015]  And this guy supposedly infiltrated it and wrote a book about it, so we'll be talking to him coming up.
[01:55:21.051 --> 01:55:25.335]  I do want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's show possible.
[01:55:25.335 --> 01:55:26.436]  One of them is Home Gain.
[01:55:26.436 --> 01:55:30.279]  You can check out Max and the Little Orange Gorilla up on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:30.279 --> 01:55:37.886]  That's their logo, their mascot.
[01:55:37.886 --> 01:55:39.608]  It's a totally free site.
[01:55:39.608 --> 01:55:40.168]  It's all free.
[01:55:40.168 --> 01:55:41.590]  A whole bunch of different functions.
[01:55:41.590 --> 01:55:42.711]  Been around for more than 10 years.
[01:55:44.102 --> 01:55:44.743]  I don't think so.
[01:55:51.078 --> 01:55:52.639]  Something I like.
[01:55:52.639 --> 01:56:04.389]  You type in your home address and it'll give you a free estimate of your home's value from some of the internal systems that realtors are actually looking at, so you can find out what they really think your house is worth, whether they're undervaluing or overvaluing or getting it just right.
[01:56:04.389 --> 01:56:06.290]  It's a great way to monitor the value of your home.
[01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:11.954]  They have the Home Sale Maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[01:56:11.954 --> 01:56:13.195]  It's homegame.com.
[01:56:13.195 --> 01:56:16.598]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[01:56:16.598 --> 01:56:17.559]  And one other sponsor.
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:28.328]  Is survival seed bank, you know, in a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow food and supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:56:28.328 --> 01:56:31.372]  Plus, these are heirloom, non-GMO, non-hybrid seeds.
[01:56:31.372 --> 01:56:32.553]  It's great to just start gardening.
[01:56:32.553 --> 01:56:34.695]  It's a good human activity.
[01:56:34.695 --> 01:56:37.559]  Anything that's human hurts the dehumanizers.
[01:56:37.559 --> 01:56:39.281]  Just being out and working in the garden is a
[01:56:40.438 --> 01:56:43.699]  Well, it's like fingernails on chalk to the globalists.
[01:56:43.699 --> 01:56:47.140]  That's why they're trying to shut it down and restrict it with a bunch of legislation.
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:53.721]  So, go to SurvivalSeedBank.com and they just got a really high quality Survival Seed Banks for you to get.

[01:56:57.162 --> 01:56:57.922]  That's 877-327-0365 or SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:57:10.194 --> 01:57:14.558]  Okay, did that answer your question, sir, about going up against the Federal Reserve?
[01:57:14.558 --> 01:57:17.981]  Did that answer your question from Canada, David?
[01:57:17.981 --> 01:57:21.365]  Well, I understand we have to do everything we can, and yeah, we're in a street fight.
[01:57:21.365 --> 01:57:23.206]  We have to fight and do what we need to do.
[01:57:23.206 --> 01:57:30.974]  But I was wondering if we're going to have the institutions prepared to install once we audit the Fed and we destroy it.
[01:57:31.485 --> 01:57:32.845]  Yeah, we can have what we had before.
[01:57:32.845 --> 01:57:33.346]  The U.S.
[01:57:33.346 --> 01:57:39.967]  government will issue the currency, and the bankers are going to pull every scam in the book, just like they did with financial terrorism in October.
[01:57:39.967 --> 01:57:41.888]  We were educating folks about that, too.
[01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:45.969]  What you do is you educate them that, you know these bankers that robbed you?
[01:57:45.969 --> 01:57:49.610]  Well, this is what they're going to do when we do this, and you defang them.
[01:57:49.610 --> 01:57:51.331]  They'll still throw a fit.
[01:57:51.331 --> 01:57:55.332]  These guys will probably do anything to keep power, but you can't get into them.
[01:57:57.239 --> 01:58:02.483]  If the money is all based on nothing and fake anyways, why should we even pay them back after we audit the Fed?
[01:58:02.483 --> 01:58:05.385]  Will we be free of that debt?
[01:58:05.385 --> 01:58:06.266]  No, no, no.
[01:58:06.266 --> 01:58:09.068]  Stuff like the derivatives and all this crud, you just wipe them off.
[01:58:09.068 --> 01:58:10.630]  You freeze them.
[01:58:10.630 --> 01:58:15.654]  People got involved in all those speculative deals, it's mainly big corrupt institutions, and you let them collapse.
[01:58:15.654 --> 01:58:20.938]  Listen, they lied to you and said, we'll give you the money to fix your mortgage if you're behind.
[01:58:20.938 --> 01:58:22.379]  We'll unclog it.
[01:58:22.379 --> 01:58:23.480]  They gave no money to it.
[01:58:24.997 --> 01:58:27.719]  In fact, it came out in mainstream news and in Congress.
[01:58:27.719 --> 01:58:28.520]  In fact, I have that clip.
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:30.121]  I'm going to play it later.
[01:58:30.121 --> 01:58:32.583]  That the Fed is paying banks not to loan.
[01:58:32.583 --> 01:58:34.824]  I told people that day one.
[01:58:34.824 --> 01:58:38.687]  It would pay for all the mortgages in the country more than twice what they've stolen.
[01:58:38.687 --> 01:58:42.710]  And they're just getting started.
[01:58:42.710 --> 01:58:46.432]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.871 --> 01:58:56.178]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:56.178 --> 01:59:00.724]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:59:00.724 --> 01:59:02.987]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:02.987 --> 01:59:04.609]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:04.609 --> 01:59:05.651]  There is a solution.
[01:59:05.871 --> 01:59:14.297]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:59:56.283 --> 01:59:59.065]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.706 --> 02:00:07.007]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.007 --> 02:00:08.767]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.767 --> 02:00:10.528]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.528 --> 02:00:12.109]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:13.689]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.689 --> 02:00:17.851]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.851 --> 02:00:23.033]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.033 --> 02:00:31.216]  Look, we've had a lot of great calls dealing with the flu and medical workers being told they're being told they've got to take it, there's no law, this is made up.
[02:00:32.819 --> 02:00:36.400]  I got a guest coming on for about 30 minutes and I'm going to continue with your calls.
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:43.381]  But I want to cycle through the calls and get people to call in who see NLE09 martial law takeover drill going on.
[02:00:43.381 --> 02:00:45.662]  That's not me saying that, FEMA says that.
[02:00:45.662 --> 02:00:47.322]  This is foreign troops with U.S.
[02:00:47.322 --> 02:00:56.804]  troops in FEMA and local police in a federalization drill which practices federalizing everything and then bringing the federal government under international control.
[02:00:57.731 --> 02:00:57.971]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:57.971 --> 02:00:58.171]  Hey, buddy.
[02:01:24.699 --> 02:01:28.761]  Yeah, I have a question about the flu vaccination.
[02:01:28.761 --> 02:01:35.065]  Now, I understand that there's no real laws about the vaccinations and its policies and recommendations.
[02:01:35.065 --> 02:01:36.206]  Yeah, there's never been a law.
[02:01:36.206 --> 02:01:41.108]  There's an executive order signed by Bush and then reauthorized by Obama.
[02:01:41.108 --> 02:01:46.151]  But when they run around saying, oh you gotta take the shot currently, they haven't implemented that.
[02:01:46.151 --> 02:01:47.892]  Notice you don't hear the White House saying it.
[02:01:47.892 --> 02:01:51.875]  They're just at the ground level so nobody gets spooked saying you gotta take the shot.
[02:01:51.875 --> 02:01:52.155]  Go ahead.
[02:01:53.191 --> 02:01:58.657]  What will the legal disposition of that be if they make it mandatory?
[02:01:58.657 --> 02:02:03.321]  Will that be an executive order or a real law or how will that work?
[02:02:03.321 --> 02:02:03.762]  Do we know?
[02:02:07.378 --> 02:02:10.923]  Yes, look, they're not going to be able to get everybody vaccinated this time.
[02:02:10.923 --> 02:02:24.381]  They try each time to set up the federal bureaucracy, not just here but worldwide, to force everybody onto this, to set the precedent, kind of as just a background idea that it's the law that you've got to take shots.
[02:02:25.806 --> 02:02:29.249]  And so they force police, medical workers, firemen.
[02:02:29.249 --> 02:02:30.209]  And most say no.
[02:02:30.209 --> 02:02:32.211]  Most departments wake up and say no.
[02:02:32.211 --> 02:02:40.097]  Some departments have particularly cowardly, dumb people in them and weak-minded police chiefs and they accept, or weak-minded hospital heads.
[02:02:40.097 --> 02:02:43.179]  The last straw was when Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take the shot.
[02:02:43.179 --> 02:02:44.740]  He was saying, it's the law, you gotta take it.
[02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:46.041]  And people said, what law?
[02:02:46.041 --> 02:02:51.044]  And I had fire chiefs and police chiefs on and hospital heads saying no.
[02:02:51.044 --> 02:02:52.526]  In fact, not just no, hell no.
[02:02:53.559 --> 02:02:57.365]  So, uh, but they'll just keep coming back.
[02:02:57.365 --> 02:02:57.946]  Coming back.
[02:02:57.946 --> 02:03:03.255]  Just like we won't let them pass carbon taxes the last five times, they're back again and this time pass it to the House.
[02:03:04.062 --> 02:03:11.004]  They tried dozens of times, for more than 30 years, to pass hate crimes laws that restrict free speech.
[02:03:11.004 --> 02:03:12.944]  They finally passed it out of the House.
[02:03:12.944 --> 02:03:14.425]  It's now passed the Senate.
[02:03:14.425 --> 02:03:15.845]  It's going into conference.
[02:03:15.845 --> 02:03:23.107]  They just keep coming back, because they've got the fighting spirit, because they know the fight belongs to who wants it most.
[02:03:23.107 --> 02:03:27.908]  And we just got to get into the fight and say, it's fun to fight these people.
[02:03:28.973 --> 02:03:34.336]  But Steve, once they get you to be self-centered and selfish, you don't care about anybody, including yourself.
[02:03:34.336 --> 02:03:41.640]  And once people have that attitude, it's an atmosphere where corruption and evil run wild.
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:45.021]  I know you are making a difference in my life, Alex.
[02:03:45.021 --> 02:03:46.502]  I work at a store.
[02:03:46.502 --> 02:03:48.503]  I keep Endgame in circulation.
[02:03:48.503 --> 02:03:50.524]  There's a waiting list for it right now.
[02:03:50.524 --> 02:03:51.565]  I got two copies.
[02:03:51.565 --> 02:03:53.065]  I keep it circulating.
[02:03:53.065 --> 02:03:54.166]  And now more than ever,
[02:03:54.713 --> 02:03:59.381]  People are staying in that store after they buy their stuff and they're listening to what I have to say.
[02:03:59.381 --> 02:04:03.829]  Whereas in the past, they would just give me a weird look and leave.
[02:04:03.829 --> 02:04:06.634]  So it's very encouraging and I thank you for that.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:09.920]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:12.861]  Just keep waking people up, keep getting involved, keep spreading the word.
[02:04:12.861 --> 02:04:22.304]  I mean, look, we've gone from 5, 10, 15 percent listening to us 10 years ago, to the media's almost panicking, going, everybody's a conspiracy theorist now!
[02:04:22.304 --> 02:04:25.024]  Nobody believes what we don't... And that's right!
[02:04:25.024 --> 02:04:31.146]  No one believes anything they say, even though a lot of the time the media tells the truth, because it's an issue that doesn't matter.
[02:04:31.146 --> 02:04:34.447]  People don't believe anything now from this scum, and that's healthy!
[02:04:34.447 --> 02:04:36.608]  That's how people were 100 years ago!
[02:04:36.608 --> 02:04:37.688]  That's what it is to be free!
[02:04:40.422 --> 02:04:43.583]  Oh, that old-timer up on the hill, he doesn't believe anything in the newspaper.
[02:04:43.583 --> 02:04:44.664]  He's dumb.
[02:04:44.664 --> 02:04:48.365]  Well, we're just finding out right now how smart that old-timer was.
[02:04:48.365 --> 02:04:50.386]  Just stop being suckers.
[02:04:50.386 --> 02:04:51.186]  God bless you, folks.
[02:04:51.186 --> 02:04:53.207]  We'll be right back with an important guest.
[02:04:53.207 --> 02:04:55.368]  On the other side, stay with us.
[02:05:01.035 --> 02:05:05.279]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:05:05.279 --> 02:05:07.281]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:05:07.281 --> 02:05:15.790]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:05:15.790 --> 02:05:21.355]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:05:21.355 --> 02:05:22.977]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[02:05:23.197 --> 02:05:29.721]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:05:29.721 --> 02:05:40.769]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:05:40.769 --> 02:05:41.549]  That's right.
[02:05:41.549 --> 02:05:44.111]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:05:44.111 --> 02:05:45.912]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[02:05:45.912 --> 02:05:46.232]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[02:05:46.232 --> 02:05:47.373]  Or visit acolablue.com.
[02:05:58.261 --> 02:06:02.323]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.323 --> 02:06:04.325]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:06:04.325 --> 02:06:05.285]  Well, you should.
[02:06:05.285 --> 02:06:09.789]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:06:09.789 --> 02:06:10.609]  That's right.
[02:06:10.609 --> 02:06:20.616]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:06:20.616 --> 02:06:21.757]  Plus, if you act fast,
[02:06:21.957 --> 02:06:27.940]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:34.844]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:06:34.844 --> 02:06:40.027]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:06:40.347 --> 02:06:41.809]  This is real.
[02:06:41.809 --> 02:06:42.870]  Don't miss out.

[02:07:01.226 --> 02:07:06.189]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:07:31.206 --> 02:07:31.866]  We're good.
[02:08:01.014 --> 02:08:15.502]  ...and for other associates of C-Street, the secretive ministry and living quarters for several members of Congress, at which Governor Sanford and Senator John Enson of Nevada both received some sort of counseling during their extramarital affairs.
[02:08:15.502 --> 02:08:23.027]  A number of other C-Street affiliates are now going on the record about the shadowy organization, mainly to defend its secrecy.
[02:08:23.027 --> 02:08:26.569]  Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma telling Roll Call newspaper, quote,
[02:08:27.089 --> 02:08:34.853]  It's a great place, and vowing to continue holding foreign policy meetings with African ambassadors at the C Street House.
[02:08:34.853 --> 02:08:47.580]  Former Ohio Congressman Tony Hall tells Politico.com the prayer breakfasts he attended at C Street were, quote, probably some of the best moments I had during the week, precisely because we closed the doors.
[02:08:48.621 --> 02:08:53.642]  Sea Street is also in the news anew because of something that happened on the House floor last week.
[02:08:53.642 --> 02:09:07.365]  A member of Congress, one with ties to Sea Street, argued against public funding for abortion services by saying that if there were public funding for abortion, Barack Obama might have been aborted as a fetus.
[02:09:07.365 --> 02:09:10.686]  Also, Clarence Thomas.
[02:09:10.686 --> 02:09:12.106]  If you think of it in human terms,
[02:09:14.619 --> 02:09:29.343]  There is a financial incentive that will be put in place, paid for by tax dollars, that will encourage women who are single parents, living below the poverty level, to have the opportunity for a free abortion.
[02:09:29.343 --> 02:09:37.405]  If you take that scenario and apply it to many of the great minds we have today, who would we have been deprived of?
[02:09:37.405 --> 02:09:39.866]  Our president grew up in those similar circumstances.
[02:09:41.002 --> 02:09:46.827]  If that financial incentive was in place, is it possible that his mother may have taken advantage of it?
[02:09:46.827 --> 02:09:55.294]  Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court Justice, if those circumstances were in place, is it possible that we would have denied his great mind?
[02:09:55.294 --> 02:10:00.398]  That's Representative Todd T. Hart, Republican of Kansas.
[02:10:00.398 --> 02:10:03.000]  I wonder how we settled on those two.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.682]  Clarence Thomas and Barack Obama.
[02:10:05.682 --> 02:10:06.463]  What do they have in common?
[02:10:07.927 --> 02:10:12.392]  Congressman Tihardt was first elected as part of the Republican Revolution in 1994.
[02:10:12.392 --> 02:10:15.615]  He is now running for the United States Senate in Kansas.
[02:10:15.615 --> 02:10:21.001]  Joining us now is Jeff Sharma, who wrote about Congressman Tihardt.
[02:10:29.608 --> 02:10:36.651]  Hello folks, here in the last two hours of the radio show today, we're simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv in living color.
[02:10:36.651 --> 02:10:47.314]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members for joining us and all the AM and FM shortwave satellite internet listeners as well, and the folks listening to the free podcast later at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:48.895 --> 02:10:50.357]  Jeff Charlotte.
[02:10:50.357 --> 02:10:56.002]  I've seen him on a lot of national TV programs and I read an article he wrote for the New York Times.
[02:10:56.002 --> 02:11:02.749]  He is a New York Times best-selling author of The Family, The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power.
[02:11:03.544 --> 02:11:05.845]  I actually saw an article about him in the New York Times.
[02:11:05.845 --> 02:11:14.351]  And a contributing editor to Harper's and Rolling Stone, has been writing about the intersection of religion, politics, and culture for more than a decade.
[02:11:14.351 --> 02:11:19.974]  His writing on religion has earned him praise from writers, and it goes on from there.
[02:11:19.974 --> 02:11:25.118]  His new book is The Family, and we've got that up on screen for everybody.
[02:11:25.118 --> 02:11:28.720]  The secret fundamentalism at the heart of American power.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:31.782]  He's here with us for most of the hour, then wide open phones coming up
[02:11:32.262 --> 02:11:40.589]  At the end of the hour and in the fourth hour covering the flu hype and NLEO-9 martial law drills going on.
[02:11:40.589 --> 02:11:41.529]  So that's coming up.
[02:11:41.529 --> 02:11:43.631]  Jeff, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:11:43.631 --> 02:11:44.932]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[02:11:44.932 --> 02:11:45.993]  It's a real honor.
[02:11:45.993 --> 02:11:46.914]  You bet, an honor to have you.
[02:11:46.914 --> 02:11:54.600]  I wanted to play Rachel Maddow, kind of breaking down what you were going over first.
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:59.964]  Tell us about yourself, how you got interested in this, about this group on K Street.
[02:12:01.713 --> 02:12:09.657]  This, the family, and then how it ties into Ashcroft's group, the Brotherhood, that's also out of another house or the same house.
[02:12:09.657 --> 02:12:11.058]  It all gets confusing.
[02:12:11.058 --> 02:12:18.361]  There's other secretive right-wing Christian groups, like the Council on National Policy.
[02:12:18.361 --> 02:12:22.744]  There's a lot of different organizations, and I haven't studied them all, but I've tried to look at some of them.
[02:12:22.744 --> 02:12:25.425]  Tell us, tell us about how you woke up to this group.
[02:12:26.621 --> 02:12:30.224]  Well, uh, I prefer to think of C Street, not K Street.
[02:12:30.224 --> 02:12:30.624]  C Street!
[02:12:30.624 --> 02:12:31.045]  There you go.
[02:12:31.045 --> 02:12:31.805]  Yes, exactly.
[02:12:31.805 --> 02:12:32.646]  I'm going to mark it.
[02:12:32.646 --> 02:12:37.009]  We think of K Street as the kind of, uh, the avenue of influence in Washington.
[02:12:37.009 --> 02:12:37.830]  I think we've got it now.
[02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:38.551]  Got a lobbyist.
[02:12:38.551 --> 02:12:39.652]  I had a Freudian slip.
[02:12:39.652 --> 02:12:40.953]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:12:40.953 --> 02:12:42.914]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:42.914 --> 02:12:48.158]  You know, it began, I was, uh, several years ago, I was working on, uh, my first book.
[02:12:48.158 --> 02:12:52.422]  I was traveling around the country and, uh, spending time with unusual religious communities.
[02:12:52.422 --> 02:12:56.125]  And a friend of mine, uh, worried that her brother had joined a cult.
[02:12:56.745 --> 02:12:57.986]  Uh, said, would you meet with him?
[02:12:57.986 --> 02:13:01.089]  Uh, this is way back in, uh, 2011.
[02:13:01.089 --> 02:13:02.430]  And, uh, so this guy came up.
[02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:05.373]  I've known him for 12 years, and frankly, he's always been kind of a jerk.
[02:13:05.373 --> 02:13:16.082]  Um, but he, he had really turned his life around, uh, despite the fact that his career left his, uh, relationship to move to Washington and be of service to powerful people.
[02:13:16.082 --> 02:13:18.344]  And he said, look, you won't understand it unless you see it.
[02:13:18.704 --> 02:13:20.424]  And you can't get in unless you're invited.
[02:13:20.424 --> 02:13:21.765]  And I said, well, how do I apply?
[02:13:21.765 --> 02:13:23.245]  And he said, there are no applications.
[02:13:23.245 --> 02:13:24.906]  There's just a family.
[02:13:24.906 --> 02:13:28.606]  So, that sounded interesting to me.
[02:13:28.606 --> 02:13:34.788]  Not as a believer, but just as a person who's interested about the variety of the religious experience, you might say.
[02:13:34.788 --> 02:13:38.249]  So, I went down and spent about a month living with these guys.
[02:13:38.249 --> 02:13:42.530]  And I didn't know it was political at first, but then we had a visit from Senator Jesse Helms.
[02:13:43.275 --> 02:13:44.976]  Okay, alright, I think I understand that.
[02:14:03.590 --> 02:14:06.772]  You know, first of all, I actually say that they are not a cult.
[02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:08.692]  I don't think they are cultish, but not a cult.
[02:14:08.692 --> 02:14:10.733]  You know, because a cult has certain characteristics.
[02:14:10.733 --> 02:14:12.054]  They are cultish.
[02:14:12.054 --> 02:14:14.935]  They've got the cult of personality around their leader, Doug Coe.
[02:14:14.935 --> 02:14:19.697]  But what they really believe, they really believe in the sort of networks of elites.
[02:14:20.257 --> 02:14:23.198]  And so because I was invited, that's the only way you get in, you get invited.
[02:14:23.198 --> 02:14:27.938]  So because I was invited by this guy, that made me sort of okay.
[02:14:27.938 --> 02:14:36.440]  And I think they were actually interested in the fact that I'm a journalist, a writer, because they saw me as an influencer, someone who can help spread the message.
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.660]  So they had me into this house.
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:47.002]  I originally wrote about this for Harper's Magazine, if anyone's been out there being skeptical at all, went through fact-checking, legal review, never been disputed, lived with these guys for
[02:14:47.262 --> 02:14:54.929]  Okay, but I mean, they're pretty confident then about the way they operate and the way they work to let a prominent journalist into their midst, though.
[02:14:54.929 --> 02:14:56.711]  I wouldn't say I was prominent at that point.
[02:14:56.711 --> 02:14:59.954]  You know, they've been around for 70 years.
[02:14:59.954 --> 02:15:01.115]  They do believe in secrecy.
[02:15:01.115 --> 02:15:07.460]  The leader of the group, Doug Coe, says the more invisible you can make your organization, the more influence it will have.
[02:15:07.460 --> 02:15:11.164]  Okay, so you did infiltrate to a certain level.
[02:15:11.164 --> 02:15:12.365]  So this is cultish, then.
[02:15:13.203 --> 02:15:14.903]  Yeah, oh, it's absolutely cultish.
[02:15:14.903 --> 02:15:21.065]  I mean, uh, you know, there's a cult of personality around this guy, Doug Crowe, whom they sometimes call First Brother.
[02:15:21.065 --> 02:15:25.547]  They say he has a special relationship with God, unparalleled by anyone else in the world.
[02:15:25.547 --> 02:15:34.069]  Uh, and that, uh, also that the Inner Circle members, and here's where it gets really creepy when we're talking about Senator and Governor Stanford, guys linked to the group,
[02:15:34.789 --> 02:15:39.193]  The Inner Circle members are not bound by the same morality that applies to the rest of us.
[02:15:39.193 --> 02:15:46.140]  The morality is a human construct, and God has a different story ready for these powerful men.
[02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:48.242]  Now is this the same group that Ashcroft's part of?
[02:15:48.242 --> 02:15:56.590]  Because I saw articles like four or five years ago about, and did some research, about Ashcroft, part of a house he lived at, and other people that were members.
[02:15:56.590 --> 02:15:58.932]  I mean, is this the only group like this, or are you aware of others?
[02:16:00.030 --> 02:16:01.472]  No, you're thinking of Ashcroft.
[02:16:01.472 --> 02:16:05.375]  I've been writing about this for a while.
[02:16:05.375 --> 02:16:11.721]  John Ashcroft, I lived with him for a month and then discovered they had dumped 600 boxes of documents unorganized.
[02:16:11.721 --> 02:16:14.283]  They hadn't even sifted through them in Billy Graham's archive.
[02:16:14.283 --> 02:16:20.429]  Yeah, so that was your article I did read about how they don't really care about abortion and they like Machiavelli, wasn't it?
[02:16:20.429 --> 02:16:22.231]  I mean, I'm going from memory here.
[02:16:23.410 --> 02:16:24.111]  John Ashcroft.
[02:16:24.111 --> 02:16:27.114]  I found letters dating back to the early 1980s.
[02:16:27.114 --> 02:16:34.321]  John Ashcroft was writing to the leader of the group, Doug Coe, first brother, saying that he wanted to get involved and could he be helped.
[02:16:34.321 --> 02:16:36.343]  And that's what the family has done historically.
[02:16:36.343 --> 02:16:38.645]  They've identified guys that they think they can work with.
[02:16:39.265 --> 02:16:44.026]  And then they groomed him and sort of raised him up the political ladder.
[02:16:44.026 --> 02:16:49.607]  Doug Coe, the leader of the group, he likes to say, we work with power where we can, build new power where we can't.
[02:16:49.607 --> 02:16:52.628]  And that means that they've got a lot of political allies in Washington.
[02:16:52.628 --> 02:16:57.389]  So it's like a political religious fraternity?
[02:16:57.389 --> 02:16:59.490]  Very much so, very much so.
[02:16:59.490 --> 02:17:05.191]  Okay, well, I mean, I know I'm throwing a lot of points in here because over the years I've done research here, there, you forget a lot more than you, you know,
[02:17:06.966 --> 02:17:11.731]  Then you can actually comprehend, but I know there's all these weird secretive groups.
[02:17:11.731 --> 02:17:25.005]  Did you ever run into any connections in this group with Masons, Masonic groups, or with Opus Dei Catholic groups, or with the CNP, Council on National Policy?
[02:17:25.894 --> 02:17:32.038]  There's a lot of overlap with the CNP guys like Ed Meese and various members like that.
[02:17:32.038 --> 02:17:35.260]  But one of the most interesting connections I did find was Opus Dei.
[02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:41.804]  And you might almost describe the family as kind of a Protestant Opus Dei, but they lack even the integrity of Opus Dei.
[02:17:41.804 --> 02:17:49.969]  But they originally were very interested in working in Spain, but they were interested in working around the world.
[02:17:49.969 --> 02:17:55.332]  The dictator for a long time there was named Franco, and he was not interested in having any Protestant groups around.
[02:17:56.276 --> 02:18:03.841]  Until they made contact with the Mr. Jones government, Opus Dei members, and then started building up a network of alliances.
[02:18:03.841 --> 02:18:12.546]  From our research, I got to spend a lot of time with Senator Sam Roundback of Kansas, who has a unique distinction of being a member of the family and an associate of Opus Dei.
[02:18:12.546 --> 02:18:21.211]  He converted to a very strange kind of Catholicism through Opus Dei's chapel, which, appropriately enough, actually is on K Street in Washington.
[02:18:22.205 --> 02:18:24.767]  Okay, see, those are the questions I haven't seen asked on television.
[02:18:24.767 --> 02:18:28.730]  I've read your articles over the years and haven't read your book yet, though we just got it.
[02:18:28.730 --> 02:18:36.015]  And so I've got a piece here, a piece there, and I'm trying to delve more into the architecture of left-wing and right-wing groups.
[02:18:36.015 --> 02:18:38.997]  Did you ever run into any connections to Bohemian Grove?
[02:18:38.997 --> 02:18:49.484]  Because a lot of, quote, Christian conservatives that have these big public personas as Christian conservatives also go to the Grove that Richard Nixon described as a homosexual orgy.
[02:18:51.031 --> 02:19:08.462]  I don't know about that part, but Doug Coe certainly is a long-time, Doug Coe, the leader of the group, is a long-time attendee, and you know, certainly we're talking about here, you know, guys like Ed Meese, former Attorney General Ashcroft, Senator Enson, we're talking about the power elite.
[02:19:08.462 --> 02:19:15.727]  And so they do go to Bohemian Grove, there is a Vatican connection, there is a Bohemian Grove connection, it's just always the same.
[02:19:16.624 --> 02:19:19.907]  Well, you know, I'm actually wary of calling that a Vatican connection.
[02:19:19.907 --> 02:19:21.369]  I would call that an open day connection.
[02:19:21.369 --> 02:19:24.391]  I think open day is a little bit distinct.
[02:19:24.391 --> 02:19:29.236]  I mean, you know, look, mainstream American Catholicism, I have no issue with that.
[02:19:29.236 --> 02:19:31.318]  Oh, hey, I'm not here bashing any groups either.
[02:19:31.318 --> 02:19:33.260]  I mean, this is a secular radio show.
[02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:35.342]  I'm trying to see how all these groups tie together.
[02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:41.912]  Wow, well listen, I'm gonna try to let you roll when we get back.
[02:19:41.912 --> 02:19:45.535]  I just wanted to ask some questions that I haven't heard asked of you before.
[02:19:45.535 --> 02:19:48.957]  And it's really great having you here with us.
[02:19:48.957 --> 02:19:52.999]  The book, ladies and gentlemen, is The Family.
[02:19:52.999 --> 02:19:55.621]  And it is available all over bookstores.
[02:19:55.621 --> 02:19:58.122]  It's got a great cover too, but also a great book inside.
[02:19:58.122 --> 02:20:00.804]  Jeff Charlotte, he'll be our guest on the other side of this break.
[02:20:02.199 --> 02:20:07.703]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:20:07.703 --> 02:20:08.483]  and the world.
[02:20:08.483 --> 02:20:12.345]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:20:12.345 --> 02:20:18.849]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:20:18.849 --> 02:20:20.891]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:20:20.891 --> 02:20:26.114]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[02:20:26.294 --> 02:20:26.634]  We're good.

[02:20:50.069 --> 02:20:50.489]  It is a big idea.
[02:20:50.489 --> 02:20:51.289]  A new world order.
[02:20:51.289 --> 02:20:53.650]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:21:10.583 --> 02:21:13.404]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:21:13.404 --> 02:21:16.185]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:21:16.185 --> 02:21:19.367]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:21:19.367 --> 02:21:26.670]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:21:29.721 --> 02:21:35.145]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:21:35.145 --> 02:21:39.027]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:21:39.027 --> 02:21:41.589]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:21:41.589 --> 02:21:42.770]  Most people have no idea.
[02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:43.530]  They're not after money.
[02:21:43.530 --> 02:21:44.831]  They have all the money they need.
[02:21:44.831 --> 02:21:45.452]  They're after power.
[02:21:45.452 --> 02:21:46.953]  That's what they're after these years.
[02:21:46.953 --> 02:21:55.638]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:55.638 --> 02:21:58.480]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:21:59.601]  You have been warned.
[02:22:00.541 --> 02:22:01.602]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:01.602 --> 02:22:06.543]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:22:06.543 --> 02:22:14.605]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:22:14.605 --> 02:22:20.207]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:22:20.207 --> 02:22:27.169]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:33.072]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:22:33.072 --> 02:22:38.135]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:22:38.135 --> 02:22:46.079]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:22:46.079 --> 02:22:51.562]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:22:52.643 --> 02:22:56.485]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.485 --> 02:23:00.046]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.046 --> 02:23:02.567]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[02:23:02.567 --> 02:23:04.908]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[02:23:04.908 --> 02:23:09.129]  The price of food continues to rise, and the economy continues to falter.
[02:23:09.129 --> 02:23:11.430]  You know that you need to prepare.
[02:23:11.430 --> 02:23:15.232]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[02:23:15.232 --> 02:23:18.293]  That's why you need to visit OrganicAseed.com.
[02:23:18.733 --> 02:23:18.974]  I think so.
[02:23:36.715 --> 02:23:37.155]  I think so.
[02:24:14.747 --> 02:24:16.648]  Folks, just a program note.
[02:24:16.648 --> 02:24:20.709]  In the next couple weeks and in the next month and a half, we're going to have some huge guests on.
[02:24:20.709 --> 02:24:23.530]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:24:23.530 --> 02:24:28.892]  And no, those huge guests are not the big astronauts we've got coming on in the next two weeks.
[02:24:28.892 --> 02:24:29.813]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:24:31.209 --> 02:24:33.351]  Little Easter egg, as they say.
[02:24:33.351 --> 02:24:35.512]  Like on a DVD, a little hidden goody.
[02:24:35.512 --> 02:24:37.754]  That is coming up later.
[02:24:37.754 --> 02:24:41.517]  Going back to the author of The Family, Jeff Charlotte.
[02:24:41.517 --> 02:24:46.680]  And this is just a bottomless pit of weirdness, but he's a great journalist, writes for Harper's.
[02:24:48.022 --> 02:24:50.743]  And for the New York Times as well.
[02:24:50.743 --> 02:24:55.024]  I saw an article in the New York Times, he writes for Harper's and Rolling Stone.
[02:24:55.024 --> 02:25:01.326]  The reason I was bringing up Harper's, it was actually Harper's had the interview with Nixon when he was talking about the Bohemian Grove.
[02:25:01.326 --> 02:25:04.267]  And so that was where my quote from that came.
[02:25:04.267 --> 02:25:05.208]  Okay, you got the floor.
[02:25:05.208 --> 02:25:07.708]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:25:07.708 --> 02:25:11.089]  Start at the beginning.
[02:25:11.089 --> 02:25:12.970]  You get to get inside there.
[02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:15.711]  You've written articles about how it's not really Christian, though,
[02:25:16.724 --> 02:25:22.706]  From not wanting to stop abortion and saying we like Machiavelli, I'm going from memory here, but a lot of weird stuff.
[02:25:22.706 --> 02:25:23.786]  What is it really?
[02:25:23.786 --> 02:25:26.067]  Some type of strange intelligence front?
[02:25:26.067 --> 02:25:28.907]  Because just in a snapshot, that's what it looks like to me.
[02:25:28.907 --> 02:25:32.408]  You know, it goes back, it begins in 1935.
[02:25:32.408 --> 02:25:38.530]  They organize Abram Brady believes that he has a vision that God comes to him and speaks to him.
[02:25:38.530 --> 02:25:45.192]  Tells him that Christianity has been getting it wrong for 2,000 years and any focus on the poor, the weak, the suffering, the down and out,
[02:25:45.672 --> 02:25:46.673]  That's not right.
[02:25:46.673 --> 02:25:51.076]  What God wants him to be is a missionary to and for the powerful.
[02:25:51.076 --> 02:25:52.777]  The up-and-out, he calls them.
[02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:56.980]  He begins organizing guys like Henry Ford and a group of congressmen.
[02:25:56.980 --> 02:25:59.341]  He gets some businessmen together.
[02:25:59.341 --> 02:26:00.942]  He starts out in the state of Washington.
[02:26:00.942 --> 02:26:06.006]  They manage to elect a governor, and on that basis, they start going overseas.
[02:26:06.006 --> 02:26:12.190]  They're involved with the whitewashing of Nazis after World War II, and then they start... Excuse me.
[02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:12.670]  Excuse me.
[02:26:12.670 --> 02:26:13.591]  Something about Nazis?
[02:26:14.152 --> 02:26:15.716]  Yeah, yeah, I'm afraid so.
[02:26:15.716 --> 02:26:18.084]  It's always suspicious when someone talks about that stuff.
[02:26:18.084 --> 02:26:19.408]  No it's not!
[02:26:19.408 --> 02:26:21.073]  I mean, you mentioned Henry Ford!
[02:26:22.407 --> 02:26:22.768]  Exactly.
[02:26:22.768 --> 02:26:23.769]  They were very sympathetic.
[02:26:23.769 --> 02:26:30.936]  So they began with this idea, you know, not only that God wanted them to serve the powerful instead of the powerless, but they began with this idea.
[02:26:30.936 --> 02:26:34.220]  They were looking around the world in the 1930s, and they thought democracy was done.
[02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:38.124]  They said democracy cannot compete with fascism and communism.
[02:26:38.124 --> 02:26:40.226]  Well, communism was definitely not for them.
[02:26:40.226 --> 02:26:44.151]  These were very wealthy businessmen, and fascism looked pretty good.
[02:26:44.571 --> 02:26:54.514]  But they didn't like it, or they didn't like Mussolini, so they said, well, we're going to do a totalitarianism for Christ, which is sort of missing the point of the Christian message, but that was their approach.
[02:26:54.514 --> 02:27:05.898]  And they started recruiting a lot of American fascist empathizers, and over the years have, when they go and make alliances with foreign dictators, they look for guys who exemplify that model.
[02:27:05.898 --> 02:27:07.018]  Doug Coe, the leader of the group,
[02:27:07.558 --> 02:27:08.078]  I don't think so.
[02:27:25.547 --> 02:27:26.628]  Is it the New Testament?
[02:27:26.628 --> 02:27:27.508]  And this is their reading.
[02:27:27.508 --> 02:27:31.070]  It's not about love or mercy or injustice or forgiveness.
[02:27:31.070 --> 02:27:32.651]  It's about power.
[02:27:32.651 --> 02:27:33.992]  And those guys understood power.
[02:27:33.992 --> 02:27:36.954]  So you want to model yourself on power.
[02:27:36.954 --> 02:27:42.077]  Another sermon you can find actually online on the website of the Navigators, a Christian right group.
[02:27:42.077 --> 02:27:45.579]  They have an audio sermon of code saying, you know how Jesus said,
[02:27:46.580 --> 02:27:48.862]  Uh, you gotta put me before your mother, father, brother, sister.
[02:27:48.862 --> 02:27:51.664]  He says, well, Hitler, Mao, that's what they taught the kids.
[02:27:51.664 --> 02:27:52.805]  This is a direct quote.
[02:27:52.805 --> 02:27:59.811]  He says, Mao even had the kids killing their parents, but it wasn't murder, Steve, because it was for building the new nation, the new kingdom.
[02:27:59.811 --> 02:28:01.612]  My God, this guy!
[02:28:01.612 --> 02:28:15.624]  Hold on, I mean, this is incredible, and you were there, this is published, it's in your book, and I'm familiar with the fake right-wing Chicago School of Business, all of this, uh, Milton Friedman, you know, the same social...
[02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:29.820]  And that's why they like Machiavelli.
[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:31.061]  See, it's all interconnected.
[02:28:31.061 --> 02:28:32.903]  I didn't know they were into Straussian.
[02:28:32.903 --> 02:28:35.826]  I just knew it fit with the Chicago school.
[02:28:35.826 --> 02:28:37.948]  Man, these people are just monstrous.
[02:28:37.948 --> 02:28:41.472]  But, you know, Obama has got a bunch of the Straussians pulling his strings.
[02:28:42.449 --> 02:28:43.970]  We've got some family guys in there, too.
[02:28:43.970 --> 02:28:52.397]  General Jim Jones, who's, you know, one of his close advisors, the guy who's been on... Oh my God, General James L. Jones?
[02:28:52.397 --> 02:28:55.499]  The head of the National Security Council?
[02:28:55.499 --> 02:28:56.520]  The real government?
[02:28:57.403 --> 02:28:59.284]  Indeed, and I'll tell you one that's a little bit crazier.
[02:28:59.284 --> 02:29:00.664]  She's not a member of the group.
[02:29:00.664 --> 02:29:05.146]  She's what they call a friend of the group, and they're very careful about those distinctions.
[02:29:05.146 --> 02:29:11.789]  She says of Doug Coe, this man I was just quoting, this language by Hilary Mount, she says he's a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide.
[02:29:11.789 --> 02:29:15.250]  She says she turned to him when she first came to Washington in 1994.
[02:29:15.250 --> 02:29:19.452]  Who am I talking about but none other than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
[02:29:19.452 --> 02:29:20.413]  Oh my gosh.
[02:29:20.413 --> 02:29:21.413]  Hold on, let me stop you.
[02:29:21.413 --> 02:29:23.254]  Let me stop you so it's bipartisan.
[02:29:23.254 --> 02:29:23.534]  Hold on.
[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:25.281]  We got a break.
[02:29:25.281 --> 02:29:25.982]  This is blowing me away.
[02:29:25.982 --> 02:29:27.304]  We're going to do the full hour with you.
[02:29:27.304 --> 02:29:28.446]  Two long segments coming up.
[02:29:28.446 --> 02:29:29.627]  That was a short one.
[02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:31.830]  See, the problem is, I haven't read the book yet.
[02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:33.332]  I've read a lot of your news articles.
[02:29:33.332 --> 02:29:38.059]  A lot of what's in there I've confirmed separate places over the years, so I know you're telling the truth.
[02:29:38.059 --> 02:29:40.642]  Plus, they admit you went there and lived there.
[02:29:41.543 --> 02:29:45.086]  So, but it's just, all these dots just connected.
[02:29:45.086 --> 02:29:48.688]  And people kept asking me about CMP, CMP, CMP.
[02:29:48.688 --> 02:29:50.029]  I didn't really know much about it.
[02:29:50.029 --> 02:29:51.911]  Now, now I know.
[02:29:51.911 --> 02:29:53.312]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.312 --> 02:29:55.834]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.834 --> 02:29:58.536]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.442 --> 02:30:03.124]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:03.124 --> 02:30:07.871]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:30:07.871 --> 02:30:10.855]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:30:10.855 --> 02:30:13.879]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:30:13.879 --> 02:30:18.626]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.

[02:31:01.067 --> 02:31:05.309]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:31:05.309 --> 02:31:07.310]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:31:07.310 --> 02:31:15.834]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:31:15.834 --> 02:31:21.396]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:31:21.396 --> 02:31:22.997]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:31:23.237 --> 02:31:29.762]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:31:29.762 --> 02:31:40.809]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:31:40.809 --> 02:31:41.590]  That's right.

[02:31:48.294 --> 02:32:06.359]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:32:06.359 --> 02:32:08.439]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[02:32:08.439 --> 02:32:10.880]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:13.160]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:14.781]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:32:14.781 --> 02:32:15.821]  There is a solution.

[02:33:13.719 --> 02:33:19.644]  Okay.
[02:33:19.644 --> 02:33:22.767]  I'm gonna be honest.
[02:33:22.767 --> 02:33:24.348]  I'm gonna be honest with listeners.
[02:33:24.348 --> 02:33:26.790]  A lot of times when I have a guest on, I'm focused.
[02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:27.471]  I've got notes.
[02:33:27.471 --> 02:33:28.412]  I've got a bunch of facts.
[02:33:29.923 --> 02:33:33.584]  A few days ago I saw Mr. Charlotte on Rachel Maddow.
[02:33:33.584 --> 02:33:38.486]  I was back in the break room drinking coffee and eating dinner up here working on a film.
[02:33:38.486 --> 02:33:40.066]  And I said, I've read his stuff before.
[02:33:40.066 --> 02:33:43.327]  Yeah, I know about Ashcroft and all those guys in this group.
[02:33:43.327 --> 02:33:45.968]  And I've been doing some more research on that.
[02:33:45.968 --> 02:33:47.188]  I want to get him on.
[02:33:47.188 --> 02:33:53.090]  But Maddow was making it a left-right thing and about how these guys are all cheating on their wives and how they're hypocrites.
[02:33:53.649 --> 02:34:10.713]  And I was like, I've read his articles and other articles about this group, how it's all Machiavellian, and the end justifies the means, and dictators, and strongmen, and I go, man, that fits into Chicago school, and the neocons, and you know, this whole sick philosophy.
[02:34:12.762 --> 02:34:17.625]  That the Globalist is kind of used to get well-meaning men to do evil things.
[02:34:17.625 --> 02:34:22.588]  The higher-up psychopaths are using it as a control system, and it's one of many groups.
[02:34:22.588 --> 02:34:32.575]  But certainly, then as he made the connections to even more powerful organizations, and I guess there is something to this, you know, I don't get too obsessed on this group or that group.
[02:34:32.575 --> 02:34:37.218]  I've found if it's CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove,
[02:34:38.018 --> 02:34:39.559]  Then it's every other group.
[02:34:39.559 --> 02:34:43.903]  The leadership of these groups are the leadership of all the other groups.
[02:34:43.903 --> 02:34:45.665]  And so it's kind of an interlocking directorate.
[02:34:45.665 --> 02:34:53.271]  But I'll be honest, now that I heard him roll with info I'd never heard him say on the shows because they always compartmentalize it.
[02:34:53.271 --> 02:34:54.893]  It made all these connections because
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:03.305]  You've got other secretive right-wing groups, like the CMP, and I've had guests on over the years that mention that.
[02:35:03.305 --> 02:35:11.051]  I thought of it more as a right-wing think tank that were globalists, but it also had some anti-globalists in it, like the Hunt brothers, so that confused me.
[02:35:12.172 --> 02:35:14.593]  And I don't think anything's the top of the pyramid.
[02:35:14.593 --> 02:35:18.595]  I think at the top of the pyramid, it's all these groups nexusing in.
[02:35:18.595 --> 02:35:21.596]  But then I didn't know there was an Opus Dei connection.
[02:35:21.596 --> 02:35:22.937]  I just threw it out there.
[02:35:22.937 --> 02:35:24.998]  He said yes and listened to the names.
[02:35:24.998 --> 02:35:36.522]  And then a Pentagon connection with the head of national security, which really is the real shadow government, James Earl Jones, and the Chicago School, and the neocons.
[02:35:36.522 --> 02:35:38.503]  And so you just blew me away.
[02:35:38.503 --> 02:35:39.744]  You just got my attention.
[02:35:40.684 --> 02:35:44.946]  And so I want to get more into the Open State Connection, more the National Security Connection.
[02:35:44.946 --> 02:35:48.107]  Take your time on Hillary as a friend.
[02:35:48.107 --> 02:35:52.008]  Take your time on their missions, their operations, what they're doing worldwide.
[02:35:52.008 --> 02:35:53.169]  I know you covered all in the book.
[02:35:53.169 --> 02:35:57.811]  I've read part of it just out and already a bestseller, The Family, Jeff Charlotte.
[02:35:57.811 --> 02:35:58.631]  But Jeff, go ahead.
[02:35:58.971 --> 02:36:10.549]  Run through it all, give us the key information here, and bottom line, just from knowing what I know about separate groups that nexus in, this does sound pretty sinister.
[02:36:12.638 --> 02:36:15.159]  Yeah, I'm glad you're saying that, Alex, and I think you're exactly right.
[02:36:15.159 --> 02:36:18.601]  We never want to make a mistake of saying there's one group that controls it all.
[02:36:18.601 --> 02:36:27.464]  There's multiple power bases, and, you know, the point I'm trying to make here is that the family is one of the most influential power bases, and yet it hasn't been measured.
[02:36:27.464 --> 02:36:32.066]  A sociologist, a conservative sociologist, actually, had it happen down there in Texas at Rice University.
[02:36:33.247 --> 02:36:42.794]  There's a survey of 360 politicians in Washington asking them to name the religious group that is most influential.
[02:36:42.794 --> 02:36:44.736]  One in three named the family.
[02:36:44.736 --> 02:36:47.278]  That's more than any other group.
[02:36:47.278 --> 02:36:51.201]  It's more votes than James Dofton's focus on the family, more than any other group.
[02:36:51.201 --> 02:36:55.465]  They named the family, and what's crazy about this is the family denies that they exist.
[02:36:56.065 --> 02:37:04.269]  If you call up the leader of the group, as I had NBC News do last year when I did a segment with them, and they said, oh no, there's nothing to see here, we don't exist.
[02:37:04.269 --> 02:37:06.149]  There's no group, it's just a group of friends.
[02:37:06.149 --> 02:37:09.931]  Fortunately, I've already shared with NBC News their tax records.
[02:37:09.931 --> 02:37:11.932]  There's 600 boxes of documents that show
[02:37:12.552 --> 02:37:16.213]  I think something that does indeed go beyond left and right.
[02:37:16.213 --> 02:37:18.054]  This is a group about power.
[02:37:18.054 --> 02:37:23.795]  Again, I'll just repeat that saying that they have, we work with power where we can, build new power where we can't.
[02:37:23.795 --> 02:37:33.398]  What that means is, unlike some right-wing groups that are just sort of extensions of the Republican Party, the family wants connections to Democrats as well.
[02:37:33.398 --> 02:37:39.140]  One is Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, pro-war Democrat from Arkansas.
[02:37:40.970 --> 02:37:42.311]  So they're apolitical.
[02:37:42.311 --> 02:37:43.552]  They want power.
[02:37:43.552 --> 02:37:43.852]  No, no, no.
[02:37:43.852 --> 02:37:44.773]  They're not apolitical.
[02:37:44.773 --> 02:37:45.494]  They're not apolitical.
[02:37:45.494 --> 02:37:46.335]  I wouldn't say that.
[02:37:46.335 --> 02:37:47.155]  They want power.
[02:37:47.155 --> 02:37:49.017]  They have some specific ends.
[02:37:49.017 --> 02:37:52.640]  One is they believe in sort of a free market fundamentalism.
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:56.344]  Well, by apolitical I meant they don't care about labels.
[02:37:57.179 --> 02:37:58.220]  They don't care about labels.
[02:37:58.220 --> 02:37:59.061]  They care about power.
[02:37:59.061 --> 02:37:59.441]  Right.
[02:37:59.441 --> 02:38:00.982]  They care about power and their agenda.
[02:38:00.982 --> 02:38:02.443]  And their agenda is two things.
[02:38:02.443 --> 02:38:05.346]  It's free market fundamentalism, and it's American empire.
[02:38:05.346 --> 02:38:11.450]  That's what they've been working on for 70 years, and I heard the lead-in, so you may appreciate this.
[02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:16.254]  Back in 1945, the leader of the group, Abraham Brady, I believe coined this phrase.
[02:38:16.254 --> 02:38:19.757]  I believe he may have been the first one to use it, although I think you'll know if I'm wrong.
[02:38:19.757 --> 02:38:21.859]  He said, there's a coming new world order.
[02:38:23.274 --> 02:38:24.275]  Wow!
[02:38:24.275 --> 02:38:29.436]  1945 had it documented in their archives.
[02:38:29.436 --> 02:38:32.397]  I don't think he coined it, but the fact that he used it.
[02:38:32.397 --> 02:38:35.358]  Hitler used it.
[02:38:35.358 --> 02:38:35.739]  H.G.
[02:38:35.739 --> 02:38:37.579]  Wells wrote a book called The New World Order.
[02:38:37.579 --> 02:38:43.501]  He was an interesting admirer of Hitler.
[02:38:43.501 --> 02:38:50.003]  Basically, they said, what we're aiming for is a form of totalitarianism.
[02:38:50.003 --> 02:38:51.544]  They said, how about a fascist dictatorship?
[02:38:52.270 --> 02:38:52.750]  Yeah.
[02:38:52.750 --> 02:38:54.530]  No, Hitler is one of the earliest.
[02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:59.651]  You can't find... Right around the same time Hitler starts using it, then H.G.
[02:38:59.651 --> 02:39:03.672]  Wells uses it, but they both wanted different forms of socialism.
[02:39:03.672 --> 02:39:07.753]  Hitler a more fascist form, though they're supposedly on different ends of the spectrum.
[02:39:07.753 --> 02:39:10.053]  National Socialists, the Nazis.
[02:39:10.053 --> 02:39:13.774]  And then Hitler wanted to have somebody kidnap and kill H.G.
[02:39:13.774 --> 02:39:14.134]  Wells.
[02:39:14.134 --> 02:39:18.315]  So, like you said, there's competing factions.
[02:39:18.315 --> 02:39:18.915]  But to go ahead.
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:27.365]  Well, I mean, you know, that's what the, you know, what I said, the bottom line of the American empire, and that's what led them into alliances.
[02:39:27.365 --> 02:39:34.289]  You know, we were talking before the break about their role in sort of whitewashing the records of former Nazis.
[02:39:34.289 --> 02:39:45.536]  One was a guy named Hermann J. Abt, who was vice president of the German operation after the war, became known as the Wizard of the West German Miracle, a brilliant financier, until it was discovered
[02:39:45.896 --> 02:39:49.158]  Oh my, so we have a Nazi connection with money coming over?
[02:39:49.158 --> 02:39:52.299]  Because we know the Bushes with Prescott have that connection.
[02:40:05.376 --> 02:40:06.937]  Well, there's more than that.
[02:40:06.937 --> 02:40:11.020]  The head of their Swiss operation after the war was a banker named Alfred Herz.
[02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:20.906]  He used the family and its access to American politicians to come over and lobby for America to lay off all the money that, of course, they had stolen.
[02:40:21.346 --> 02:40:26.308]  Wait a minute, this is the group that blocked the investigation of the Rat Line and the gold and diamonds?
[02:40:47.757 --> 02:40:49.138]  They were a group, you know.
[02:40:49.138 --> 02:40:50.399]  I think you made an important point.
[02:40:50.399 --> 02:40:55.642]  There's no single group controlling all this stuff, but there's lots of different power bases in Washington.
[02:40:55.642 --> 02:40:58.764]  Yeah, it's like a swarm of viruses or something.
[02:40:58.764 --> 02:41:01.766]  It's a whole bunch of them, but going in the same direction.
[02:41:01.766 --> 02:41:03.667]  More power, more control.
[02:41:03.667 --> 02:41:06.869]  Specifically, let's get more into that history, but can you backtrack?
[02:41:06.869 --> 02:41:10.131]  Because I read your articles years ago in Harper's and Rolling Stone.
[02:41:10.131 --> 02:41:10.911]  Yeah.
[02:41:10.911 --> 02:41:16.795]  Because I remember just reading this and then going and Googling some of it and finding that, you know, you were telling the truth because it was so shocking.
[02:41:17.595 --> 02:41:26.079]  about their philosophy and we don't care about abortion we want Jesus wants power we don't care about you know this and that we like Machiavelli.
[02:41:26.079 --> 02:41:31.101]  I mean this sounds like a psycho cult masquerading as Christians.
[02:41:31.101 --> 02:41:33.663]  Well let me give you a quote.
[02:41:33.663 --> 02:41:39.505]  This is from the news and we had in that reading we had a congressman Todd Fiat talking about abortion.
[02:41:39.505 --> 02:41:41.566]  It's not that they don't care about those issues.
[02:41:41.566 --> 02:41:44.248]  The group tends to be pretty right-wing conservative so they care.
[02:41:44.248 --> 02:41:45.508]  That's just not their bottom line.
[02:41:45.508 --> 02:41:47.009]  Their bottom line is American empire.
[02:41:47.509 --> 02:41:57.096]  But one time I was at the C Street House, this is the House in Washington, where they're providing below market housing for Congressmen, Republicans and Democrats, by the way, this is a bipartisan thing.
[02:41:57.096 --> 02:42:01.139]  This is a bipartisan power-lust, you might say.
[02:42:01.139 --> 02:42:05.363]  And I was there, and Doug Coe, the leader of the group, was counseling Congressman Todd Keyhart.
[02:42:05.363 --> 02:42:07.384]  Well, Todd Keyhart had come in.
[02:42:07.384 --> 02:42:10.146]  Todd Keyhart is not what you would call an enlightened man.
[02:42:10.146 --> 02:42:16.191]  He said he was concerned that the Christian was losing the race with the Muslim.
[02:42:16.731 --> 02:42:18.592]  You know, he said, what is this guy talking about?
[02:42:18.592 --> 02:42:19.632]  This is crazy.
[02:42:19.632 --> 02:42:25.775]  What he meant was, he said that Muslims are having too many babies, while Christians are not having enough.
[02:42:25.775 --> 02:42:26.876]  So it turns out, P.R.
[02:42:26.876 --> 02:42:29.137]  represents himself as an ardent foe of abortion.
[02:42:29.137 --> 02:42:30.777]  What he means is abortion for Christians.
[02:42:30.777 --> 02:42:33.298]  He doesn't care if Muslims have abortions.
[02:42:33.298 --> 02:42:34.839]  In fact, he would like that.
[02:42:34.839 --> 02:42:38.861]  Well, now Doug Powell, listening to this, says, okay, yeah, I hear you talking about this abortion issue.
[02:42:39.381 --> 02:42:44.663]  You know, I sort of agree with you on that, and that's fine, but I want you to think bigger.
[02:42:44.663 --> 02:42:47.665]  What I want you to do is to think in terms of a covenant.
[02:42:47.665 --> 02:42:58.509]  Can you describe the covenant as something that men of power enter into secretly, privately, because of a publicly invisible but privately identifiable group of companions?
[02:42:58.509 --> 02:43:00.210]  That's in their official document.
[02:43:00.210 --> 02:43:00.930]  Is it a covenant?
[02:43:00.930 --> 02:43:02.811]  If it's a covenant, you can do so much more.
[02:43:02.811 --> 02:43:04.612]  If you think of men with a covenant,
[02:43:05.012 --> 02:43:05.232]  Good lord!
[02:43:22.048 --> 02:43:28.510]  But again, when you're saying all of this, I'm thinking about the Straussian economists and philosophers.
[02:43:28.510 --> 02:43:32.291]  I'm thinking about the Chicago school, the Rockefellers.
[02:43:32.291 --> 02:43:35.952]  The Rockefellers similarly funded other schools of thought.
[02:43:35.952 --> 02:43:40.153]  Have you ever run into Rockefeller foundations or Rockefeller money in all this?
[02:43:40.253 --> 02:43:48.540]  Rockefeller, and there may be more, but in the early days of the family, you know, the Rockefeller Foundation, of course, has gone through a lot of different incarnations, you know.
[02:43:48.540 --> 02:43:54.225]  At one point, it was essentially almost a fund for CIA money, and that's been documented pretty well.
[02:43:54.225 --> 02:43:55.687]  And it founded Modern Eugenics.
[02:43:56.505 --> 02:44:09.671]  Yeah, in the early days they were indeed giving the family, which was then known as International Christian Leadership, they changed their name every few years, they say, to avoid scrutiny, basically.
[02:44:09.671 --> 02:44:12.633]  But he gave some money to them to get started.
[02:44:12.633 --> 02:44:14.934]  I mean, you really see all the titans of American commerce.
[02:44:15.074 --> 02:44:16.715]  Well, you always have the Rockefellers.
[02:44:16.715 --> 02:44:20.537]  I mean, discovering cancer viruses, Rockefellers, setting up them.
[02:44:20.537 --> 02:44:23.619]  I mean, just the whole system was set up by these people.
[02:44:23.619 --> 02:44:24.500]  See, I didn't know that.
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:25.200]  You're the expert.
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:26.261]  Of course they're involved.
[02:44:26.261 --> 02:44:29.303]  It's kind of like you lift up a stone and that's where you find the bugs.
[02:44:29.303 --> 02:44:30.683]  But look, other key points.
[02:44:30.683 --> 02:44:31.284]  I'm interrupting.
[02:44:31.284 --> 02:44:33.465]  This just gets more insane.
[02:44:33.465 --> 02:44:34.926]  Is their power getting greater?
[02:44:34.926 --> 02:44:36.147]  Is it waning?
[02:44:36.147 --> 02:44:38.668]  Do you get threats?
[02:44:38.668 --> 02:44:40.569]  I mean, what is it?
[02:44:40.569 --> 02:44:40.890]  Lights?
[02:44:42.119 --> 02:44:51.966]  I tell you, I mean, this is almost maybe the comic section of the book, you know, because I'd first written about this in Harper's, so in Chapter 9 of the book, The Family, I talk about some of the early reactions.
[02:44:51.966 --> 02:44:54.748]  One was his speaking engagement in Germany.
[02:44:54.748 --> 02:44:55.349]  Get over there.
[02:44:55.349 --> 02:44:57.931]  Turns out the whole speaking period is paid for by the U.S.
[02:44:57.931 --> 02:44:58.691]  Embassy.
[02:44:58.691 --> 02:44:59.512]  Get off the plane.
[02:44:59.512 --> 02:45:01.733]  My German host says, you know, there's a problem.
[02:45:01.733 --> 02:45:05.896]  Your ambassador says that he cannot pay for you because you are an enemy of Jesus.
[02:45:05.896 --> 02:45:07.738]  This is the ambassador of the United States.
[02:45:08.198 --> 02:45:09.059]  Who is it?
[02:45:09.059 --> 02:45:11.580]  It's a guy named Senator Dan Coats.
[02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:12.941]  Not the brightest bulb on the porch.
[02:45:12.941 --> 02:45:15.202]  Considered Dan Quayle his mentor.
[02:45:15.202 --> 02:45:22.606]  A guy so off the charts that when Bush proposed him for Secretary of Defense, Cheney vetoed him as too fanatical.
[02:45:22.606 --> 02:45:24.587]  That kind of guy.
[02:45:25.828 --> 02:45:35.000]  But even one of the other responses was a phone call I get from one day from a guy who's an executive for the oil company Pride Former.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.843]  A very big international company involved in this stuff.
[02:45:37.843 --> 02:45:39.586]  He's calling me from Angola.
[02:45:39.586 --> 02:45:41.328]  Says he's just a fan of my work.
[02:45:41.328 --> 02:45:42.009]  Isn't that great?
[02:45:42.009 --> 02:45:43.591]  A call from Angola from a fan of my work.
[02:45:44.972 --> 02:45:49.135]  As we talked for a good long while, it turns out he's a member of the family.
[02:45:49.135 --> 02:45:52.017]  He's actually trying to recruit me back into it.
[02:45:52.017 --> 02:45:53.839]  So I try and get some counter-arguments.
[02:45:53.839 --> 02:45:56.721]  I said, what about the family's involvement in Indonesia?
[02:45:56.721 --> 02:46:00.504]  The dictator Fajardo killed 1.2 million of his own people.
[02:46:00.504 --> 02:46:04.587]  And his only counter-argument is that must be what God wanted for Indonesia.
[02:46:04.587 --> 02:46:06.689]  1.2 million people dead.
[02:46:06.689 --> 02:46:08.470]  That was God's will.
[02:46:08.470 --> 02:46:10.372]  The truth is they're playing God.
[02:46:10.372 --> 02:46:11.973]  That's what this whole power trip's about.
[02:46:12.762 --> 02:46:27.833]  Yeah, you know, it was very well put to me by... I did an interview with someone from the Cato Institute, which is a very conservative think tank in Washington, and they really believe in free markets, and so I thought they weren't going to like the book, but they looked at it and said, these guys aren't talking about free markets.
[02:46:27.833 --> 02:46:29.054]  There's nothing free about this.
[02:46:29.054 --> 02:46:30.695]  This is crony capitalism.
[02:46:30.695 --> 02:46:34.658]  The phrase they used, I thought, was really just dead on, was self-interest by proxy.
[02:46:35.018 --> 02:46:36.678]  These guys get together in a small group.
[02:46:36.678 --> 02:46:37.479]  That's what a prayer cell is.
[02:46:37.479 --> 02:46:43.420]  That's what Senator Anson, who we've been hearing about, Governor Stanford, those guys, Senator Coburn, they get together in a prayer cell.
[02:46:43.420 --> 02:46:44.580]  They don't actually read the Bible.
[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:45.560]  I've been there for these things.
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:47.561]  They don't actually study the Bible.
[02:46:47.561 --> 02:46:49.521]  One man will say, you know, I have a message from Jesus.
[02:46:49.521 --> 02:46:51.381]  I think Jesus gave me a message for you.
[02:46:51.381 --> 02:46:59.523]  And in the case of Senator Anson and Coburn, the message seemed to be pay your mistress some hush money to keep yourself out of the public eye.
[02:47:00.203 --> 02:47:10.810]  But, you know, the one thing that's really important about that whole scandal you mentioned talking about on Manow and so on and folks on the sex scandal of the Republicans, the more important thing is that I don't care about their sex scandal.
[02:47:10.810 --> 02:47:11.370]  Exactly.
[02:47:11.370 --> 02:47:16.334]  The question is, I don't want you to get in a fight with Manow, but why does the media always make it left or right?
[02:47:16.834 --> 02:47:19.617]  One of the very few people pushing the story.
[02:47:19.617 --> 02:47:23.662]  I mean, this story has been around for a while, and I'm not... Every now and then someone makes an attempt.
[02:47:23.662 --> 02:47:32.993]  The Los Angeles Times did a year-long investigation in 2002, published their results, incredible stuff, linking the family to Central American death flaws, all kinds of stuff.
[02:47:33.373 --> 02:47:33.994]  We're good to go.
[02:47:56.975 --> 02:48:10.686]  NBC thought they had the scoop of the campaign season, not a peep, because our American political press, they're religiously illiterate, they don't know the questions to ask, and, you know... Yeah, but Hitler, I mean, Hitler was a freak.
[02:48:10.686 --> 02:48:15.369]  I mean, why this obsession with Hitler?
[02:48:15.369 --> 02:48:18.372]  It's the most extreme... I mean, in some ways it's sort of...
[02:48:19.710 --> 02:48:21.591]  It is literally idiotic.
[02:48:21.591 --> 02:48:27.832]  You know, at one point I asked someone that when I was living with her, I said, I find this very troubling.
[02:48:27.832 --> 02:48:30.513]  They said, well, it's not his end that we're interested in.
[02:48:30.513 --> 02:48:32.353]  It's his methods.
[02:48:32.353 --> 02:48:35.114]  And you're just blown away by that.
[02:48:35.114 --> 02:48:39.535]  But even that, they... Somebody's behavior is the manifestation of who they are.
[02:48:40.865 --> 02:48:41.806]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:48:41.806 --> 02:48:44.208]  Well, and Hitler's methods were absolutely horrific.
[02:48:44.208 --> 02:48:45.710]  But they misunderstand, though.
[02:48:45.710 --> 02:48:46.751]  They like to talk about it.
[02:48:46.751 --> 02:48:48.773]  They say, look, here's what Hitler did.
[02:48:48.773 --> 02:49:02.185]  Hitler got together with a little group of friends in the back of a Bavarian beer hall, and working together, just like you guys are going to work together, whether it's Senator Inman and Senator Coburn, or two younger guys in the group, just like you work together, look what they were able to do.
[02:49:02.185 --> 02:49:04.287]  They were able to take over the world.
[02:49:04.287 --> 02:49:05.608]  But that's the same baloney!
[02:49:09.153 --> 02:49:25.673]  Well, Hitler also, this is mainline history, was hired by German intelligence to set that group up to monitor people, and then it got some British funding later from the King of England, Edward VIII, and so Hitler didn't just pop up out of a cabbage patch.
[02:49:26.405 --> 02:49:35.674]  Well, the important thing to recognize with these guys is that they're all sort of power-hungry political opportunists, and I think that's what you get with a family.
[02:49:35.674 --> 02:49:42.981]  You know, the thing about it is, look, a lot of the young guys I live with, even some of the congressmen I've spoken to, they get involved with the best of intentions.
[02:49:42.981 --> 02:49:44.202]  They really, genuinely do.
[02:49:44.202 --> 02:49:46.004]  I'll even say that of Senator Brownback.
[02:49:46.004 --> 02:49:47.766]  Yeah, that's like congressmen going to...
[02:49:51.767 --> 02:50:01.881]  The head of the Washington Times, Mr. Moon, I mean total cult, and they said, we didn't know that this was going to be a crowning ceremony as him as the Messiah.
[02:50:01.881 --> 02:50:05.786]  There they are embarrassed, gulping as crowns are being put on his head.
[02:50:05.786 --> 02:50:08.150]  How does that individual tie into all this?
[02:50:08.936 --> 02:50:14.823]  You know, there's a big overlap there, but that's yet again a distinct power base.
[02:50:14.823 --> 02:50:18.107]  But there is that overlap, and that example that you gave, we didn't know.
[02:50:18.107 --> 02:50:20.010]  I think that's been in the news.
[02:50:20.010 --> 02:50:22.573]  Again, I emphasize the bipartisan aspect of this.
[02:50:22.573 --> 02:50:26.238]  Congressman Bart Stupak of Michigan has been living for seven years.
[02:50:27.318 --> 02:50:30.359]  There's also a Bohemian Grove connection.
[02:50:30.359 --> 02:50:31.619]  We know what Nixon said about that.
[02:50:56.235 --> 02:50:57.536]  Anyway, sir, stay there.
[02:50:57.536 --> 02:51:02.058]  We're going to come right back and continue with other key points.
[02:51:02.058 --> 02:51:12.623]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:51:12.623 --> 02:51:14.044]  Garden in a can.
[02:51:14.044 --> 02:51:18.186]  Garden in a can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[02:51:18.186 --> 02:51:20.207]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[02:51:20.207 --> 02:51:22.488]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[02:51:22.968 --> 02:51:31.962]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[02:51:32.637 --> 02:51:34.058]  Garden in a Can.
[02:51:34.058 --> 02:51:35.258]  It's that simple.
[02:51:35.258 --> 02:51:37.659]  Fresh, healthy, easy.
[02:51:37.659 --> 02:51:42.001]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[02:51:42.001 --> 02:51:43.582]  Ready when you are.
[02:51:43.582 --> 02:51:47.644]  Stop procrastinating and start preparing with Garden in a Can.

[02:52:01.818 --> 02:52:07.843]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.843 --> 02:52:13.728]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:52:13.728 --> 02:52:19.894]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:20.214 --> 02:52:22.195]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:22.195 --> 02:52:24.657]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:24.657 --> 02:52:37.846]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:52:37.846 --> 02:52:39.527]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.527 --> 02:52:41.389]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.389 --> 02:52:47.613]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:53:00.891 --> 02:53:02.573]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:53:02.573 --> 02:53:04.315]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:53:04.315 --> 02:53:06.999]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:53:06.999 --> 02:53:12.145]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:53:12.145 --> 02:53:15.330]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[02:54:14.957 --> 02:54:19.144]  The military drills, what do you see in your area?
[02:54:19.144 --> 02:54:21.107]  Troops from 14 nations involved.
[02:54:21.107 --> 02:54:21.828]  That's FEMA.gov.
[02:54:24.065 --> 02:54:25.947]  More on the flu, fear-mongering, all of this.
[02:54:25.947 --> 02:54:28.410]  But Jeff Charlotte, I've got to have him back up in the near future.
[02:54:28.410 --> 02:54:30.332]  JeffCharlotte.com.
[02:54:30.332 --> 02:54:34.756]  Charlotte spelled S-H-A-R-L-E-T.com.
[02:54:34.756 --> 02:54:36.799]  The book is The Family.
[02:54:36.799 --> 02:54:37.740]  We'll put that up on screen.
[02:54:37.740 --> 02:54:46.369]  But here is Mr. Moon, Sun Yung Moon, the head of the Moonies, having crowns put on saying he's above Jesus.
[02:54:47.629 --> 02:54:51.071]  And I don't try to get in fights with all these religious groups and all this.
[02:54:51.071 --> 02:54:56.994]  It's just that when they try to get political power and have secretive agendas, they have to be discussed.
[02:54:56.994 --> 02:54:59.055]  And I expose everything here.
[02:54:59.055 --> 02:55:00.936]  That's all we're trying to do.
[02:55:00.936 --> 02:55:01.997]  And this is freakish.
[02:55:02.677 --> 02:55:06.538]  And there's nothing Christian about John Ashcroft and his Patriot Act and the rest of it.
[02:55:06.538 --> 02:55:13.599]  There's nothing liberal about Barack Obama hiring nothing but K Street Boys now and swearing he never would.
[02:55:13.599 --> 02:55:17.360]  But I want to come back in this final five-minute segment in a few minutes and take two or three calls.
[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:26.782]  But first, in the four or five minutes we have left in this segment, other key points you haven't told us about as you're giving us the dirt on these individuals.
[02:55:28.086 --> 02:55:34.569]  Well, you know, I think really the biggest point that we want to look at is how the family is acting like a lobby.
[02:55:34.569 --> 02:55:38.611]  They're not registered as a lobby, but they're paying for travel for congressmen to go overseas.
[02:55:38.611 --> 02:55:47.736]  Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma went on at least 20 missionary trips to Africa, who paid for it.
[02:55:47.736 --> 02:55:49.217]  In that case, he actually finagled it.
[02:55:49.217 --> 02:55:55.100]  He says he went on behalf of the family, promoting the political philosophy of Jesus as taught to him by Doug Cobo.
[02:55:55.100 --> 02:55:57.681]  So it's a tax-exempt lobby on top of it?
[02:55:58.664 --> 02:56:00.785]  In his case, he went even further.
[02:56:00.785 --> 02:56:03.565]  He actually got the Senate Armed Services Committee to pay for it, $187,000.
[02:56:03.565 --> 02:56:07.846]  He went to the President of Nigeria.
[02:56:07.846 --> 02:56:10.647]  The State Department didn't want him to meet with him, went there.
[02:56:10.647 --> 02:56:12.567]  He got Senator Colburn going to Lebanon.
[02:56:12.567 --> 02:56:16.809]  This is a country that's had civil war between Christians and Muslims for a long, long time.
[02:56:16.809 --> 02:56:18.529]  They do not need this kind of interference.
[02:56:18.889 --> 02:56:36.541]  Senator Coburn went there and he said, you know what, on his official form, paid for by the family by one of their foundations, the International Foundation, he says, I'm going to set up a confidential Christian prayer cell in the Lebanese government, just like the one he used to help cover up the political affairs of Senator Enson.
[02:56:36.541 --> 02:56:45.207]  So this group is doing this stuff, and when we dig into their own history, we dig into their own archives, we don't have to accuse them or make any wild-eyed, you know, claims and so on.
[02:56:45.207 --> 02:56:47.209]  We see an absolutely bloody history.
[02:56:47.449 --> 02:56:49.930]  How are you getting into their archives?
[02:56:49.930 --> 02:56:55.691]  They dump 600 boxes of unorganized papers in the Billy Graham Center archives.
[02:56:55.691 --> 02:57:09.736]  And I went there, I was one of the very first people to start poking around, and we're talking about budgets, memos, formal correspondence, even confidential government documents, a lot of stuff on Congressional... Why is it at the Billy Graham Center?
[02:57:09.736 --> 02:57:10.336]  Is he involved?
[02:57:11.836 --> 02:57:14.297]  Marginally, but not too much.
[02:57:14.297 --> 02:57:15.578]  A little bit.
[02:57:15.578 --> 02:57:17.659]  I think he's got his own thing going.
[02:57:17.659 --> 02:57:25.443]  But Billy Graham did help them set up this annual ritual, which has become sort of an annual lobbying festival called the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington.
[02:57:25.443 --> 02:57:26.924]  Every year, everybody attends.
[02:57:26.924 --> 02:57:27.964]  The President attends.
[02:57:27.964 --> 02:57:28.685]  Congress attends.
[02:57:29.385 --> 02:57:31.847]  It's ostensibly ecumenical.
[02:57:31.847 --> 02:57:33.369]  Everybody is represented.
[02:57:33.369 --> 02:57:35.931]  Internal document says anything could happen.
[02:57:35.931 --> 02:57:37.252]  Even the Koran could be read.
[02:57:37.252 --> 02:57:41.776]  And by that they meant they're referring to Saudi Prince Bandar, who they invited to speak.
[02:57:41.776 --> 02:57:43.557]  He said, but Jesus is there.
[02:57:43.557 --> 02:57:44.938]  He's infiltrating the world.
[02:57:44.938 --> 02:57:51.144]  And by Jesus, of course, you just have to remember, they're not talking about anything you ever learned in Sunday school.
[02:57:51.144 --> 02:57:54.006]  They're talking about the idea of American empire.
[02:57:54.006 --> 02:57:56.808]  They're talking about the idea... They're talking about the Hitler Jesus.
[02:57:58.655 --> 02:58:04.543]  The Jesus of strength and power, rather than the one of love and forgiveness, yes.
[02:58:04.543 --> 02:58:14.538]  Well, look, obviously intelligence agencies love to use missionaries in groups like this, and as you said, the Rockefellers are deeply involved in that.
[02:58:15.950 --> 02:58:24.792]  So this is obviously just one more powerful group in all of this and I would imagine you would say even some of the people involved are doing so they believe for good reasons.
[02:58:24.792 --> 02:58:36.434]  I think that's what it's for is to co-opt well-meaning Christian men to kind of warp their sense for the end justifies the means to then go carry out really bad stuff.
[02:58:36.434 --> 02:58:39.555]  But we'll get your take on that in 70 seconds and take a couple phone calls.
[02:58:43.427 --> 02:58:46.048]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.048 --> 02:58:51.590]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:56.792]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:58:56.792 --> 02:59:00.814]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.814 --> 02:59:06.396]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.716 --> 02:59:07.356]  It's true.
[02:59:07.356 --> 02:59:12.699]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:12.699 --> 02:59:19.002]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:59:19.002 --> 02:59:21.904]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:59:21.904 --> 02:59:26.426]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.426 --> 02:59:30.028]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:59:30.268 --> 02:59:35.992]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[02:59:35.992 --> 02:59:40.694]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.694 --> 02:59:42.455]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.455 --> 02:59:45.037]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:59:45.037 --> 02:59:48.819]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:59:48.819 --> 02:59:56.784]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.784 --> 02:59:59.546]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:22.517 --> 03:00:32.744]  I think the moral to the story is power-seeking individuals love to array themselves in fraternal secretive arrays.
[03:00:32.744 --> 03:00:37.688]  And we'll be looking more at the CMP, more at the family,
[03:00:39.372 --> 03:00:42.706]  I've seen it referred to in similar groups as Brotherhoods.
[03:00:42.706 --> 03:00:44.553]  There's the Masonic Networks as well.
[03:00:46.038 --> 03:00:48.720]  Those are all compartmentalized and varied.
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:01:00.911]  But at the top, the superclass that Rothkopf talked about, the head of the Kissinger Group on this show, it's just 6,000 global controllers that are the heads of all these groups, and then they manage the whole planet through that system.
[03:01:00.911 --> 03:01:04.214]  And that's the message that I try to get out most importantly.
[03:01:04.214 --> 03:01:10.539]  Brian in Iowa, you're on the air with the author of this new book, JeffCharlotte.com's website.
[03:01:10.539 --> 03:01:10.840]  Go ahead.
[03:01:11.493 --> 03:01:12.233]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:01:12.233 --> 03:01:13.394]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[03:01:13.394 --> 03:01:27.457]  As a quick comment, I'd just like to say, Alex, at first that it's interesting that yesterday you had Robert Gibbs on and then today you've got all the rags like Greek Bird, AP, Drudge, USA Today coming out with articles going against everything that you guys talked about yesterday.
[03:01:27.457 --> 03:01:28.778]  It's kind of something.
[03:01:28.778 --> 03:01:29.578]  Yeah, that was crazy.
[03:01:29.578 --> 03:01:32.719]  I mean, I just said this is not an original bird certificate.
[03:01:32.719 --> 03:01:34.159]  That's why it's getting so big.
[03:01:34.159 --> 03:01:36.300]  We just discussed it and I don't...
[03:01:37.260 --> 03:01:41.303]  I noticed it was getting real big, so I'm getting back into covering it now.
[03:01:41.303 --> 03:01:45.206]  I don't think Politico and all them are attacking us just because I covered it.
[03:01:45.206 --> 03:01:53.892]  But it is true that on top of all of this, Chris Matthews did say you're mentally ill.
[03:01:54.833 --> 03:02:03.998]  If you question Obama's birth, but... Well, and you also had the health director of Hawaii coming out and saying that it was also, we've proven it and it's already out there.
[03:02:03.998 --> 03:02:05.418]  Listen though, I appreciate your call.
[03:02:05.418 --> 03:02:06.679]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[03:02:06.679 --> 03:02:09.480]  The guest stayed over just to take questions for himself.
[03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:10.541]  So I appreciate your call, Brian.
[03:02:10.541 --> 03:02:12.842]  Let's see if John in Ohio wants to talk to the guest.
[03:02:12.842 --> 03:02:15.223]  Go ahead, John.
[03:02:15.223 --> 03:02:22.647]  Yes, I was aware of the connections to the, of Hillary Clinton and James Jones to this organization.
[03:02:23.254 --> 03:02:31.444]  And interestingly, I saw a very critical expose of that on the World Socialist website some many months ago, maybe a year ago.
[03:02:31.444 --> 03:02:42.337]  So I think what we're seeing here, and incidentally, I hope you'd have somebody on from the Black Agenda Report, blackagendareport.com, because this is one black organization, very erudite.
[03:02:42.797 --> 03:02:48.699]  That completely blows the pretense that Obama cares about black, whites, or anybody else.
[03:02:48.699 --> 03:02:54.000]  And I remember Webster Tarpley commending them about a week ago on his program.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:58.482]  So I think this would be a very good antidote to those... Okay, set up the Black Agenda Report.
[03:02:58.482 --> 03:03:00.582]  John, do you have a question for our guests?
[03:03:00.582 --> 03:03:02.183]  We've got about a minute and a half left here.
[03:03:02.183 --> 03:03:03.223]  Right.
[03:03:03.223 --> 03:03:09.965]  Now, you mentioned that the free market, fundamentalism, imperialism, war, and empire
[03:03:10.464 --> 03:03:10.804]  I really
[03:03:26.573 --> 03:03:36.624]  They are operatives of the same fake liberal organizations that are used in a disguise for these really fundamentally rational organizations.
[03:03:36.624 --> 03:03:38.906]  Let me get a comment from him on that.
[03:03:38.906 --> 03:03:42.110]  Your take on what John from Ohio was just saying, Mr. Shorrock?
[03:03:42.310 --> 03:03:50.672]  I think John gives us the one good point, which is that a lot of the powerful folks involved in this who want to not be distracted by those labels like liberals and conservatives.
[03:03:50.672 --> 03:03:57.834]  Rather, I think we want to look at how are they serving this project of American empire versus American democracy.
[03:03:57.834 --> 03:03:58.814]  That's the bottom line.
[03:03:58.814 --> 03:04:00.835]  Which do you believe in, democracy or empire?
[03:04:01.195 --> 03:04:02.136]  And the point I want to make is...
[03:04:24.722 --> 03:04:27.264]  That we pay for this empire.
[03:04:27.264 --> 03:04:31.066]  So many Americans feel like, yeah, kill them brown people, take their oil.
[03:04:31.066 --> 03:04:35.309]  And I've heard a lot of people on talk radio, yeah, we're taking the brown people's oil.
[03:04:35.309 --> 03:04:37.791]  It's kind of a redneck Klan thing.
[03:04:37.791 --> 03:04:40.533]  Hey, dummies, you're paying for all this.
[03:04:40.533 --> 03:04:41.334]  You don't get it.
[03:04:41.334 --> 03:04:44.276]  The big banks, the offshore corporations do.
[03:04:44.276 --> 03:04:47.138]  Stop thinking you're part of the power structure.
[03:04:47.138 --> 03:04:50.300]  Well, Jeff Charlotte, I appreciate you coming on about the book.
[03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:55.109]  The family and as things unfold, I look forward to have you back on the show soon.
[03:04:55.109 --> 03:04:56.311]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[03:04:57.142 --> 03:04:58.283]  Thanks a lot Alex.
[03:04:58.283 --> 03:04:59.303]  You bet.
[03:04:59.303 --> 03:05:01.065]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are our websites.
[03:05:01.065 --> 03:05:02.546]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.546 --> 03:05:04.547]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:05:04.547 --> 03:05:05.528]  Well you should.
[03:05:05.528 --> 03:05:10.011]  He has a free handgun and 5 days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:05:10.011 --> 03:05:10.831]  That's right.
[03:05:10.831 --> 03:05:19.477]  You can attend 5 days of world class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit.
[03:05:19.477 --> 03:05:20.838]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[03:05:20.838 --> 03:05:21.979]  Plus if you act fast.
[03:05:22.179 --> 03:05:28.167]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:05:28.167 --> 03:05:35.076]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:05:35.076 --> 03:05:40.263]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:05:40.583 --> 03:05:42.044]  This is real.
[03:05:42.044 --> 03:05:43.105]  Don't miss out.

[03:06:01.547 --> 03:06:03.208]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:03.208 --> 03:06:07.969]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:06:07.969 --> 03:06:10.931]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:06:10.931 --> 03:06:13.972]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:06:13.972 --> 03:06:19.814]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:06:20.054 --> 03:06:23.277]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:06:23.277 --> 03:06:30.262]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:06:30.262 --> 03:06:33.545]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:06:33.545 --> 03:06:34.946]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[03:06:38.689 --> 03:06:44.953]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[03:06:44.953 --> 03:06:48.555]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.

[03:06:50.076 --> 03:06:50.717]  Take action today.
[03:06:50.717 --> 03:06:52.498]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:07:01.667 --> 03:07:02.968]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:07:02.968 --> 03:07:08.552]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:07:08.552 --> 03:07:13.575]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:07:13.575 --> 03:07:19.159]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:07:19.159 --> 03:07:23.842]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:07:24.363 --> 03:07:31.485]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[03:07:31.485 --> 03:07:32.606]  And here's the best part.
[03:07:32.606 --> 03:07:35.667]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:07:35.667 --> 03:07:39.288]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:07:39.288 --> 03:07:42.489]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:42.489 --> 03:07:45.490]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:07:45.490 --> 03:07:45.750]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:07:45.750 --> 03:07:45.990]  Remember,
[03:07:54.417 --> 03:07:58.341]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:07:58.341 --> 03:08:02.146]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:08:02.146 --> 03:08:04.929]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.929 --> 03:08:07.712]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.039 --> 03:08:11.301]  Okay, I am insanely news blitzing.
[03:08:11.301 --> 03:08:19.569]  I want to get your NLE09 calls, reports, martial law drill with 14 different nations publicly to engage the American people.
[03:08:19.569 --> 03:08:21.731]  FEMA admits it.
[03:08:21.731 --> 03:08:24.714]  Foreign troops, Israeli, German, British.
[03:08:24.714 --> 03:08:25.895]  The list goes on and on.
[03:08:25.895 --> 03:08:29.539]  We have articles up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:08:29.539 --> 03:08:30.500]  People are getting scared.
[03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:31.441]  They don't even know this show.
[03:08:31.901 --> 03:08:39.806]  I have friends and family and other talk show hosts all over the country saying people are hearing they're going to be forced to take a shot and they're upset and saying, how do I not take it?
[03:08:39.806 --> 03:08:45.190]  Well, just don't roll your sleeve up.
[03:08:45.190 --> 03:08:46.671]  Eating during the break there.
[03:08:46.671 --> 03:08:48.972]  Don't roll your sleeves up.
[03:08:48.972 --> 03:08:50.273]  Don't go along with it.
[03:08:50.273 --> 03:08:51.094]  Expose it.
[03:08:51.094 --> 03:08:56.998]  And once a few percentage points say no, the whole thing will fall apart and implode.
[03:08:56.998 --> 03:08:57.158]  Now,
[03:08:59.827 --> 03:09:00.748]  I want to discuss that.
[03:09:00.748 --> 03:09:01.468]  I want to cover that.
[03:09:01.468 --> 03:09:04.089]  But I'm going to your calls.
[03:09:04.089 --> 03:09:06.471]  One minute apiece.
[03:09:06.471 --> 03:09:09.613]  I just can't seem to be able to do this because the callers are always so great.
[03:09:09.613 --> 03:09:13.935]  Just make your point or ask me the question because I want to get to the next person.
[03:09:13.935 --> 03:09:15.136]  That's how we get to everybody.
[03:09:15.136 --> 03:09:18.118]  Because I want to get to some NLE09 calls.
[03:09:18.118 --> 03:09:19.558]  I want to get to some other issues here.
[03:09:19.558 --> 03:09:21.820]  And I got a big news blitz coming up the last 10-15 minutes.
[03:09:21.820 --> 03:09:24.882]  But right now, Colton in Canada disagrees.
[03:09:24.882 --> 03:09:25.482]  Go ahead, Colton.
[03:09:26.687 --> 03:09:28.488]  Hey Alex, good to hear from you.
[03:09:28.488 --> 03:09:31.170]  I've actually been listening to your radio show for about seven years.
[03:09:31.170 --> 03:09:36.313]  I'm a member of Prison Planet TV and I actually got into it when I first started to listen to you.
[03:09:36.313 --> 03:09:40.315]  I kind of got thrown off because you have a very eccentric personality.
[03:09:40.842 --> 03:09:45.143]  And then, when I actually listened to one of your radio shows, you said, don't take my word for it.
[03:09:45.143 --> 03:09:47.204]  I challenge you, go and look for the information.
[03:09:47.204 --> 03:09:49.124]  Okay, go ahead and tell me what you disagree with.
[03:09:49.124 --> 03:09:57.847]  Everything that you come up with, I go and I do a research on it, and for the first, like, four or five years, everything that you've come up with, I've always been able to verify through everything.
[03:09:58.277 --> 03:10:07.167]  I've only had one thing that I've never been able to, that you've mentioned on your show, that I've actually found the exact opposite.
[03:10:07.167 --> 03:10:12.713]  You haven't had two individuals by the name of Robert Menard or John Harris on.
[03:10:12.713 --> 03:10:18.780]  There's a group in the UK, part of the We Are Change group, a guy named
[03:10:19.841 --> 03:10:20.502]  Let's just stop right there.
[03:10:20.502 --> 03:10:21.122]  Stop right there.
[03:10:21.122 --> 03:10:23.724]  You're saying you found something I said that isn't accurate.
[03:10:49.195 --> 03:10:50.416]  I make mistakes all the time.
[03:10:50.416 --> 03:10:58.180]  Most of my mistakes are, I called it K Street, the lobbyists, because I have an article about Obama getting rid of all lobbying rules worse than Bush.
[03:10:58.180 --> 03:11:00.942]  The lobbyists are openly writing all the policy and law.
[03:11:00.942 --> 03:11:03.503]  Complete flip-flop.
[03:11:03.503 --> 03:11:05.264]  I called C Street, K Street.
[03:11:05.264 --> 03:11:06.645]  So you got to watch me on stuff.
[03:11:06.645 --> 03:11:08.306]  It's not intentional.
[03:11:08.306 --> 03:11:11.468]  You know, I flip things around because I'm busy on air.
[03:11:11.468 --> 03:11:13.549]  You're bringing up We Are Change.
[03:11:13.549 --> 03:11:17.271]  I mean, I'm the one that put We Are Change on the map when telling people to join Luke's group.
[03:11:18.897 --> 03:11:22.759]  So I'm, or maybe that's not what you're saying, I'm lying about or I'm wrong about.
[03:11:22.759 --> 03:11:23.720]  What is your point?
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:24.720]  Quickly, come on!
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:28.022]  What you're wrong about is the whole reference to the straw man.
[03:11:28.022 --> 03:11:33.224]  There's, uh, in the legal definitions of the word person, these people have actually gone to court.
[03:11:33.224 --> 03:11:36.186]  I know, Black's Law, all of it.
[03:11:36.186 --> 03:11:39.848]  Yeah, you go into Black's Law, you can go into the case laws like, um,
[03:11:40.620 --> 03:11:48.306]  I've got a case law reference here, Luther v. Borden, Site 48, US 1, 1849.
[03:11:48.306 --> 03:11:53.130]  Listen, listen, I told you one minute apiece and I appreciate your call.
[03:11:53.130 --> 03:11:59.815]  You got about three.
[03:11:59.815 --> 03:12:02.297]  It is so hard to respond to this.
[03:12:02.297 --> 03:12:09.483]  I lovingly try to stay away from all this stuff because I don't like sending my listeners to prison.
[03:12:09.483 --> 03:12:09.783]  Okay?
[03:12:12.665 --> 03:12:19.387]  If I had a dollar for every quack liar on the radio and TV, and I don't know those people you mentioned.
[03:12:19.387 --> 03:12:21.188]  So I'm not saying they are.
[03:12:21.188 --> 03:12:28.631]  If I had a dollar for every person that claims, file this straw man, file these liens, get this bond out, do this.
[03:12:28.631 --> 03:12:33.092]  The whole common law system is set that you can swear to something and go file it.
[03:12:33.092 --> 03:12:35.373]  But then if it isn't true, you're going to get in trouble.
[03:12:35.373 --> 03:12:37.894]  But there's so much of it that they can't respond to all of it.
[03:12:39.563 --> 03:12:41.633]  I've had people file fake liens on me.
[03:12:41.633 --> 03:12:43.060]  I've had all sorts of stuff go on.
[03:12:44.153 --> 03:12:49.535]  All I'm saying is there's such a minefield of disinfo and false law out there.
[03:12:49.535 --> 03:13:00.260]  Certainly the government creates a straw man and gets you to waive rights through contract and it's a lie to say you gotta take vaccines and I hear lawyers on air saying Admiralty only deals with ships.
[03:13:00.260 --> 03:13:05.022]  No, I've seen federal courts declare Admiralty stealing people's property in the US.
[03:13:05.022 --> 03:13:07.883]  So there's kernels of truth to all this.
[03:13:07.883 --> 03:13:09.184]  I just don't get up here
[03:13:10.004 --> 03:13:17.187]  And push people into all of these theories about law and ideas when they don't even know their Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[03:13:17.187 --> 03:13:29.193]  Now, I know there's some freeman societies and groups that I've seen give some decent speeches in England explaining how the system works and telling the system, I'm not going along with you.
[03:13:29.193 --> 03:13:34.356]  That is a human declaration as a free being and creature.
[03:13:34.356 --> 03:13:34.856]  Okay, so
[03:13:36.041 --> 03:13:38.931]  You don't understand the point I'm making and what I'm saying.
[03:13:38.931 --> 03:13:41.379]  So hey, go knock yourself out!
[03:13:42.316 --> 03:13:48.520]  I just see a lot of people claim they've won this case, or claim they've done this, or claim they've done that, and it's normally not true.
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:50.201]  I don't know about those groups you mentioned.
[03:13:50.201 --> 03:13:53.643]  I'm just saying, look out, there's a lot of bull out there.
[03:13:53.643 --> 03:14:02.187]  I don't steer my giant audience off into kind of patriot kook land, where there's all this imaginary baloney going on.
[03:14:02.187 --> 03:14:05.089]  I don't talk about chupacabras and space aliens.
[03:14:05.089 --> 03:14:06.290]  You know, I'm not...
[03:14:07.602 --> 03:14:09.625]  I just spent five minutes with you, pal.
[03:14:09.625 --> 03:14:12.729]  I'm gonna take these calls and each person's getting one minute, okay?
[03:14:12.729 --> 03:14:15.112]  Because we... David in Thailand, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:14:16.758 --> 03:14:19.520]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[03:14:19.520 --> 03:14:31.046]  Watching the Chris Matthews video and other things like it where they're tying the birth certificate issue to things like 9-11 and Bilderberg.
[03:14:31.046 --> 03:14:35.289]  Yeah, they're saying Bilderberg doesn't exist and if you talk about it you need to go to a mental institution.
[03:14:35.289 --> 03:14:36.730]  Sounds like the Soviet Union.
[03:14:36.730 --> 03:14:41.573]  They're saying if you question his birth certificate when they won't release it, it's a certificate of a certificate.
[03:14:41.573 --> 03:14:44.975]  It's a receipt of live birth and it looks like it's forged.
[03:14:46.376 --> 03:14:49.721]  They're saying if you question the swine flu, you're insane.
[03:14:49.721 --> 03:14:52.985]  You've got to do what they say, because they're losing control.
[03:14:52.985 --> 03:14:53.326]  Go ahead.
[03:14:54.673 --> 03:15:10.996]  Yeah, that's making me think that maybe he was actually born in Hawaii, but they're just holding that back and creating this fake controversy and tying it to all these other real things, and then when they get ready, they're going to... Yeah, you never know with a PSYOP.
[03:15:10.996 --> 03:15:15.056]  You never know with a PSYOP, and I was thinking that in the shower this morning after I went for a jog.
[03:15:15.056 --> 03:15:23.478]  I'm going, wait a minute, they could be acting like, you know, they're upset with this to really hype it up and then disprove it later, but
[03:15:24.358 --> 03:15:32.287]  If that's true, their body language, and it's hard to fake it, they look like they hate having to cover it, and they're actually scared of it.
[03:15:32.287 --> 03:15:34.189]  And let me tell you, they're scared of anything spontaneous.
[03:15:34.189 --> 03:15:35.431]  They're masters of hoaxes.
[03:15:36.690 --> 03:15:45.159]  So even if it's a hoax that he was born in Kenya, and that it's not a hoax that he was born in Hawaii, they are afraid of stuff.
[03:15:45.159 --> 03:15:46.801]  They're masters of lies.
[03:15:46.801 --> 03:15:48.743]  So let's say it could be a lie.
[03:15:48.743 --> 03:15:57.032]  They're scared of town halls where spontaneously the town hall's not even about Obama, and everybody's yelling and screaming about his birth certificate.
[03:15:57.032 --> 03:15:58.614]  No, they're genuinely scared.
[03:15:58.874 --> 03:16:01.296]  We have to stop not accepting victory.
[03:16:01.296 --> 03:16:02.698]  Now, I'm not saying you're a bad caller.
[03:16:02.698 --> 03:16:04.259]  I have the same thoughts this morning.
[03:16:04.259 --> 03:16:06.461]  I'm always analyzing and thinking.
[03:16:06.461 --> 03:16:08.683]  Every waking moment, even when I dream, I'm thinking about this stuff.
[03:16:11.764 --> 03:16:16.365]  No, I genuinely think they tried to ignore it, and they're scared, and that makes me think it's probably true.
[03:16:16.365 --> 03:16:20.706]  And there's a lot of pieces that go into that, but regardless, it isn't good for Obama.
[03:16:20.706 --> 03:16:27.247]  And anything that stalls him is good, but if it isn't true that he was born in Kenya, I will try to come out and expose that.
[03:16:27.247 --> 03:16:30.368]  But my gut tells me that they're covering something up.
[03:16:30.368 --> 03:16:36.129]  I'm not sure what it is, but it's a very, very serious, big issue.
[03:16:37.566 --> 03:16:53.715]  But after Obama is defeated as a political demagogue, as long as that train stalls and he can't get his agenda through, then we've got to point out he's just a puppet and not make it about a new system where judo, where they use our action against him to put a new right-wing puppet in.
[03:16:53.715 --> 03:16:58.757]  You see, we've got to stop that left-right dynamo.
[03:16:58.757 --> 03:16:59.718]  You understand the point I'm making?
[03:17:00.888 --> 03:17:17.742]  Yeah, I just think, you know, if he actually was, and when they got ready they brought that out and showed that it was true, it would discredit all the other 9-11 and the Fed and Bilderberg that they've been tying that to, and all the people that have been talking about it would be all discredited.
[03:17:17.742 --> 03:17:21.305]  Yeah, no, see, sir, but we can hypothetically think of anything all day.
[03:17:21.305 --> 03:17:25.389]  The system, and I appreciate your call, is discredited.
[03:17:25.389 --> 03:17:27.631]  The system is discredited.
[03:17:28.473 --> 03:17:29.294]  That's what I mean.
[03:17:29.294 --> 03:17:34.918]  He may have been born in Hawaii, but everybody knows the government and the media have been caught lying a billion times.
[03:17:34.918 --> 03:17:41.343]  So, if they said Obama was black, people wouldn't believe it.
[03:17:41.343 --> 03:17:42.524]  Of course, because that's a lie too.
[03:17:42.524 --> 03:17:44.865]  He's really 6.5% black.
[03:17:44.865 --> 03:17:46.246]  African.
[03:17:46.246 --> 03:17:49.069]  Most of it's Arab or white.
[03:17:49.069 --> 03:17:49.949]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:17:49.949 --> 03:17:53.572]  It's just... It's a total confidence loss is what's happening.
[03:17:56.775 --> 03:18:01.777]  It's very sophisticated what they've done, and they've just basically destroyed confidence.
[03:18:01.777 --> 03:18:02.398]  I don't know.
[03:18:02.398 --> 03:18:04.739]  We're gonna find out, okay?
[03:18:04.739 --> 03:18:06.640]  You got a good point, though.
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:08.580]  Let's talk to Paul in Florida.
[03:18:08.580 --> 03:18:09.241]  Paul, go ahead.
[03:18:09.241 --> 03:18:13.703]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:18:13.703 --> 03:18:15.283]  Go ahead, you're on air.
[03:18:15.283 --> 03:18:15.564]  Yeah!
[03:18:15.564 --> 03:18:16.884]  Hey there.
[03:18:16.884 --> 03:18:18.125]  Go ahead!
[03:18:18.125 --> 03:18:21.846]  Some of your fans have put together a really cool thing for you.
[03:18:21.846 --> 03:18:22.247]  Thank you.
[03:18:22.247 --> 03:18:24.808]  It's called I'm Sick, alright?
[03:18:25.482 --> 03:18:32.588]  And it's at MySpace.com forward slash Screaming Alex.
[03:18:32.588 --> 03:18:32.948]  All right.
[03:18:32.948 --> 03:18:33.469]  Thank you, sir.
[03:18:33.469 --> 03:18:36.071]  I appreciate that call.
[03:18:36.071 --> 03:18:38.193]  Let's talk to Nick in Florida.
[03:18:38.193 --> 03:18:39.053]  Nick, you're on the air.
[03:18:39.053 --> 03:18:40.234]  Go ahead, Nick.
[03:18:40.234 --> 03:18:41.435]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[03:18:41.435 --> 03:18:42.676]  Long time, first time.
[03:18:42.676 --> 03:18:49.322]  I wanted to let you know that my best friend, he's got a family friend who works at Raytheon in Tampa.
[03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:56.216]  And, uh, he said he works at the receiving, uh, and shipping area throughout the entire building.
[03:18:56.216 --> 03:18:59.560]  He receives everything that comes in, every order that gets put in.
[03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:09.492]  He said that they had a huge order for, like, 500,000 riot gear suits, and he said that in the whole time that he's been working there for, like, 20-something years, he said he's never seen nothing like it.
[03:19:10.540 --> 03:19:15.185]  Well, that's not just your buddy at Raytheon, because we can't confirm that, but I believe you.
[03:19:15.185 --> 03:19:16.125]  It's all over the news!
[03:19:16.125 --> 03:19:31.240]  They've ordered body bags and riot gear and have tried to train the main army force for a riot and are having military drills everywhere to condition everybody and saying... I mean, again, they destroy the economy, that causes riots, then that sets the precedent for the police state.
[03:19:31.240 --> 03:19:32.041]  What else did he say?
[03:19:36.608 --> 03:19:38.890]  Did he say anything else there, caller?
[03:19:38.890 --> 03:19:39.450]  Um, no.
[03:19:39.450 --> 03:19:43.953]  He just said that they had ordered riot gear suits and he had never seen anything like it.
[03:19:43.953 --> 03:19:57.442]  It was a huge order and he was basically telling everybody he knew and he told my best friend, who is a relative of his, and he said, I mean, he doesn't listen to your show, he doesn't even have a computer, but he was scared and he was telling me about it and I said, well that's what Alex Jones has been talking about.
[03:19:58.683 --> 03:20:00.504]  Well, thank you so much for that tip.
[03:20:00.504 --> 03:20:01.965]  More calls straight ahead.
[03:20:01.965 --> 03:20:06.467]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[03:20:06.467 --> 03:20:11.590]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:20:11.590 --> 03:20:13.090]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:20:13.090 --> 03:20:16.692]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[03:20:16.692 --> 03:20:22.115]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[03:20:28.198 --> 03:20:30.719]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[03:20:36.860 --> 03:20:38.061]  No animal testing.
[03:20:38.061 --> 03:20:39.401]  I use them and love them.
[03:20:39.401 --> 03:20:41.282]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[03:20:54.185 --> 03:21:02.288]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[03:21:02.288 --> 03:21:08.330]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:08.330 --> 03:21:14.193]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:14.193 --> 03:21:20.355]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:20.695 --> 03:21:22.656]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:22.656 --> 03:21:25.137]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:25.137 --> 03:21:38.323]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:21:38.323 --> 03:21:39.984]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:39.984 --> 03:21:41.845]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:21:41.845 --> 03:21:48.088]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:21:48.746 --> 03:21:57.015]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:57.015 --> 03:21:58.597]  The Obama Deception.
[03:21:58.597 --> 03:21:59.799]  The people strike back!
[03:22:01.553 --> 03:22:02.033]  Good day.
[03:22:02.033 --> 03:22:03.735]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:03.735 --> 03:22:04.055]  July 28, 2009.
[03:22:04.055 --> 03:22:05.095]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5030.
[03:22:05.095 --> 03:22:08.278]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.7747, $4.8873 for a half-ounce, or $2.4437 for the quarter-ounce.
[03:22:08.278 --> 03:22:08.718]  That's $9.7747, $4.8873, or $2.4437.
[03:22:21.013 --> 03:22:34.639]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:22:34.639 --> 03:22:35.859]  Is this capitalism?
[03:22:35.859 --> 03:22:43.483]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:22:43.483 --> 03:22:44.583]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:44.583 --> 03:22:48.725]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:22:48.925 --> 03:22:50.026]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:50.026 --> 03:22:51.869]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:22:51.869 --> 03:22:52.109]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:52.109 --> 03:22:52.409]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:02.003 --> 03:23:06.186]  Most Americans know the significance of July 4th, 1776.
[03:23:06.186 --> 03:23:14.311]  However, few know the importance of September 17th, 1787, the day the Constitution was written and adopted by our founders.
[03:23:14.311 --> 03:23:20.716]  Unfortunately, over 200 years later, this sacred document is under attack, along with our beloved Republic.
[03:23:20.976 --> 03:23:28.100]  Throughout the span of history, brave men and women have rallied behind banners which have served as symbols of liberty against the forces of tyranny.
[03:23:28.100 --> 03:23:35.624]  Today, we have the Constitution Pride Flag to show our support for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Freedom, Liberty,
[03:23:36.084 --> 03:23:39.445]  And justice for we the people of the United States.

[03:23:50.270 --> 03:23:57.012]  www.1787flags.com The official website of the Constitution Pride flag.
[03:23:57.012 --> 03:23:58.593]  That's www.1787flags.com
[03:24:07.935 --> 03:24:12.796]  Yeah, they want us to all be fighting with each other.
[03:24:12.796 --> 03:24:17.378]  That's why they love saying, we gotta have more discussions of race in America.
[03:24:17.378 --> 03:24:22.460]  Everybody's like these neurotic quits, scared of using words.
[03:24:22.460 --> 03:24:24.560]  And everybody's afraid of making somebody upset.
[03:24:24.560 --> 03:24:28.502]  But government, though, will keep all the groups under control.
[03:24:28.502 --> 03:24:30.483]  Take your shots.
[03:24:30.483 --> 03:24:31.363]  We love you.
[03:24:35.319 --> 03:24:37.080]  Alright, let's go back to your calls here.
[03:24:37.080 --> 03:24:37.881]  Who's up next?
[03:24:37.881 --> 03:24:39.702]  Chad in Florida?
[03:24:39.702 --> 03:24:42.103]  Chad in Florida, go ahead.
[03:24:42.103 --> 03:24:43.524]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[03:24:43.524 --> 03:24:44.505]  How are you, sir?
[03:24:44.505 --> 03:24:44.985]  Good, Chad.
[03:24:44.985 --> 03:24:46.586]  What's on your mind today?
[03:24:46.586 --> 03:24:48.587]  I will keep this under a minute for you.
[03:24:48.587 --> 03:24:54.571]  I have two questions, but basically one of them only needs a response on air from you.
[03:24:54.571 --> 03:25:00.295]  First off, you are my mentor, and I appreciate you so much.
[03:25:00.295 --> 03:25:02.516]  I interviewed Gia Rick Griffin on July 18th.
[03:25:04.887 --> 03:25:07.989]  And he did such an incredible job.
[03:25:07.989 --> 03:25:09.470]  He wants to come back on.
[03:25:09.470 --> 03:25:16.494]  And they got me in touch with Jim Mars, so I hope that maybe you can verify that I know Joan Hunter, his personal assistant.
[03:25:16.494 --> 03:25:19.195]  Maybe off there I can... Sir, I don't even know what you're talking about.
[03:25:19.195 --> 03:25:25.459]  I mean, I'm like taking calls and I always get people calling in plugging or their radio shows.
[03:25:25.459 --> 03:25:26.259]  I mean, what are you saying?
[03:25:26.259 --> 03:25:27.100]  G. Edward Griffin?
[03:25:27.850 --> 03:25:33.374]  I'm saying that he came on my show and he wants to come back on and I would, I hope that I can maybe get you on somehow.
[03:25:33.374 --> 03:25:48.844]  My question was about NLE, and do you think, just like with before 9-11, do you think, I mean are your spidey sense up with this one about, could this be, and this swine flu be the actual
[03:25:52.034 --> 03:25:54.496]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[03:25:54.496 --> 03:25:59.059]  I can't seem to break this habit of taking one or two calls an hour when I can take hundreds an hour.
[03:25:59.059 --> 03:26:01.680]  I mean, unlimited calls.
[03:26:01.680 --> 03:26:05.503]  And there's so many great callers I want to get on that have important tips and info to cover.
[03:26:05.503 --> 03:26:10.146]  Plus, I'm a loud mouth, blowhard, you know, and I need to shut up.
[03:26:11.195 --> 03:26:13.319]  Yes, my Spidey Sense is off the chart.
[03:26:13.319 --> 03:26:15.302]  Not about NLE09.
[03:26:15.302 --> 03:26:19.429]  That's just the Feds testing the total takeover with foreign troops.
[03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:24.217]  That intellectually and historically is off the charts, very upsetting.
[03:26:24.980 --> 03:26:41.894]  But the way they're hyping this flu that's super weak, that's clearly man-made though, and digging the mass graves and getting ready, I said that back in March, even before April, and now they're saying get ready for forced inoculations and setting up emergency tents and troops, even in Austin at Camp Mabry.
[03:26:41.894 --> 03:26:43.656]  I went over there a few days ago and confirmed that.
[03:26:43.656 --> 03:26:48.019]  I mean, this is, this, they're getting ready for something big as a political cover
[03:26:48.956 --> 03:26:59.211]  For the banking takeover, and the water takeover, and the carbon tax takeover, and the hate speech takeover, and the... Just all of it's happening right now.
[03:26:59.211 --> 03:27:02.536]  Yes, my Spidey Sense is off the charts upset.
[03:27:02.536 --> 03:27:02.797]  Okay?
[03:27:04.068 --> 03:27:10.070]  And we've all got a sixth sense, but mine is intellectual and also in my gut, and it's off the chart right now.
[03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:15.331]  And everybody else is freaking out, saying, I'm worried, I don't want to take the shot, something's going on, I'm worried.
[03:27:15.331 --> 03:27:17.072]  And they're getting ready to make a move.
[03:27:17.072 --> 03:27:23.454]  Obama's approval rating's dropping, the establishment needed him to get their agenda through, and they're going to stage something, get ready.
[03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:26.142]  Just absolutely.
[03:27:26.142 --> 03:27:28.644]  As for me coming on your radio show, I have never been this busy.
[03:27:28.644 --> 03:27:30.025]  I'm behind doing a book.
[03:27:30.025 --> 03:27:32.408]  I gotta finish the new Obama film.
[03:27:32.408 --> 03:27:46.020]  That means a website and cover design and finish the film and it's just insane and it's so good and I'm up here every night till one in the morning that I've really cut back on doing interviews almost down to nothing.
[03:27:46.020 --> 03:27:46.301]  Okay?
[03:27:48.132 --> 03:27:49.313]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[03:28:14.464 --> 03:28:18.668]  I've heard you mention this on several shows and I have one thing I disagree with you on.
[03:28:18.668 --> 03:28:36.586]  You said the Rockefellers discovered the cancer virus and from my research I found out there was an inventor named Royal Reif who discovered the cancer virus using his high-end optics and actually the Rockefellers stole those ideas from the inventor himself.
[03:28:37.458 --> 03:28:41.340]  Yeah, I mean, that's how many angels can dance to the head of a pen.
[03:28:41.340 --> 03:28:48.703]  I've heard the recordings of Reif sitting there drinking scotch, you know, claiming that he invented the sun, almost.
[03:28:48.703 --> 03:28:59.228]  And I'm not saying he probably didn't invent some interesting things, but he also, I've seen film of him with big so-called projectors to do stuff with flying saucers.
[03:28:59.228 --> 03:29:06.371]  So, I don't just accept what the government says, and the media says, and I don't accept what Royal Raymond Reif and everybody else says.
[03:29:08.430 --> 03:29:19.667]  I'm saying the Rockefeller Foundation, in this research I did from declassified university studies, they, in the 20s, funded the research.
[03:29:21.798 --> 03:29:33.989]  Discovered that most cancer was viral, and then they started vaccine programs and cancer research and treatment facilities, putting it in the vaccines, and then they make the money off of you when you die from the cancer.
[03:29:33.989 --> 03:29:35.210]  That was my point!
[03:29:35.210 --> 03:29:38.152]  Is they're killing us with cancer!
[03:29:38.152 --> 03:29:38.853]  Okay?
[03:29:38.853 --> 03:29:40.454]  Instead, we're talking about Raymond Rife.
[03:29:40.454 --> 03:29:43.177]  And I'm not mad at you, but my God, man!
[03:29:44.215 --> 03:29:46.499]  Just, just, it just never ends!
[03:29:46.499 --> 03:29:48.762]  What about not taking the shots?
[03:29:48.762 --> 03:29:50.225]  That was my issue!
[03:29:50.225 --> 03:29:51.908]  That they're giving us cancer!
[03:29:51.908 --> 03:29:53.290]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.290 --> 03:29:55.834]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.834 --> 03:29:58.538]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.314 --> 03:30:06.621]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.621 --> 03:30:11.167]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:11.167 --> 03:30:13.430]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.430 --> 03:30:15.052]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:15.052 --> 03:30:16.094]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.314 --> 03:30:24.740]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:31:05.515 --> 03:31:07.517]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:31:07.517 --> 03:31:16.046]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:31:16.046 --> 03:31:21.591]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:31:21.591 --> 03:31:23.233]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:31:23.453 --> 03:31:29.955]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[03:32:26.144 --> 03:32:29.585]  Trigger finger gloves, $5 a pair or $36 a dozen.
[03:32:29.585 --> 03:32:33.106]  Snowshoe binding for $8 or $48 a dozen.
[03:32:33.106 --> 03:32:34.426]  And so much more!
[03:32:34.426 --> 03:32:38.127]  Even hard to find surplus items, all at surplus prices.
[03:32:38.127 --> 03:32:43.189]  Preparing the whole family has never been so affordable at MainMilitary.com.
[03:32:43.189 --> 03:32:44.789]  MainMilitary.com.
[03:32:44.789 --> 03:32:47.650]  One of the last surviving true surplus stores in the country.
[03:32:48.010 --> 03:32:52.612]  Shop now at MAINEMILITARY.COM or call 877-608-0179.
[03:32:52.612 --> 03:32:53.212]  That's 877-608-0179 today.
[03:32:53.212 --> 03:33:07.696]  Yeah, on the Royal Raymond Rife stuff, there might have been some truth to that, but I mean, if I have one more kook show at my office with a
[03:33:16.112 --> 03:33:21.436]  Glass ray gun with some flashing light in the end and they claim it heals cancer.
[03:33:21.436 --> 03:33:25.819]  I mean, it makes me sick.
[03:33:25.819 --> 03:33:30.643]  And this is part of magical thinking and Harry Potter delusion.
[03:33:30.643 --> 03:33:34.226]  Now, are there all sorts of magnetic and scalar technology in real systems?
[03:33:34.226 --> 03:33:35.307]  Yes.
[03:33:35.307 --> 03:33:36.468]  Is there weather modification?
[03:33:36.468 --> 03:33:36.788]  Yes.
[03:33:36.788 --> 03:33:41.752]  But all of this kookiness gets in the way of real research of things we can prove.
[03:33:41.752 --> 03:33:43.193]  And that's how the system discredits us.
[03:33:44.522 --> 03:33:46.504]  Now, I don't try to police this.
[03:33:46.504 --> 03:33:48.385]  People call in and ask me about it.
[03:33:48.385 --> 03:33:50.787]  I'm going to go off the deep end.
[03:33:50.787 --> 03:33:55.731]  I mean, I've seen locals on AXS TV saying they're wizards.
[03:33:55.731 --> 03:34:04.658]  And then they go out to lakes and have wires they stick in the water with plastic pyramids and go, look, I'm power beaming the sky.
[03:34:04.658 --> 03:34:05.158]  I mean this.
[03:34:05.158 --> 03:34:08.100]  And then I'm the crazy one because I don't believe this.
[03:34:08.100 --> 03:34:10.342]  No, it's bull.
[03:34:10.342 --> 03:34:11.123]  It's delusion.
[03:34:17.588 --> 03:34:25.111]  You know, when I tell you about NLE09 and troops from 14 countries here training for martial law, FEMA says that, but in their own spin.
[03:34:25.111 --> 03:34:34.454]  Oh, they're here to help us with a simulated terror attack on the homeland by domestic terrorists, and they're going to also help us spy on the American people, you know, run surveillance.
[03:34:34.454 --> 03:34:40.036]  I mean, it's total federalization drill with foreign troops, and nobody cares about that.
[03:34:40.036 --> 03:34:40.396]  It's all
[03:34:42.392 --> 03:34:45.474]  Obama and race relations or O.J.
[03:34:45.474 --> 03:34:49.436]  Simpson or Michael Jackson, they love issues with black people.
[03:34:49.436 --> 03:34:52.518]  Then they can make it all about black and white.
[03:34:52.518 --> 03:34:53.619]  It's mind control, folks.
[03:34:53.619 --> 03:34:55.460]  I've just had enough of it.
[03:34:55.460 --> 03:34:57.341]  And also, we're going into a depression.
[03:34:57.341 --> 03:34:59.402]  We're going into a collapse of society.
[03:34:59.402 --> 03:35:03.144]  And your Oregon plastic pyramids ain't gonna save you.
[03:35:03.144 --> 03:35:04.185]  I'll tell you right now.
[03:35:06.820 --> 03:35:07.400]  There, I've done it.
[03:35:07.400 --> 03:35:09.681]  I've made the entire Plastic Pyramid group mad.
[03:35:09.681 --> 03:35:11.201]  Look, the point, I just can't handle it.
[03:35:11.201 --> 03:35:14.142]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Michigan.
[03:35:14.142 --> 03:35:16.362]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[03:35:16.362 --> 03:35:17.462]  Hello, Alex.
[03:35:17.462 --> 03:35:17.982]  Hi, buddy.
[03:35:17.982 --> 03:35:19.843]  What's on your mind?
[03:35:19.843 --> 03:35:24.984]  I'm going to stick to the format, L-N-E-O-9.
[03:35:24.984 --> 03:35:35.426]  I live in Lansing, 10 miles west of us is a major helicopter hub for Army, whatever.
[03:35:36.244 --> 03:35:41.392]  In Grand Legend, there's just been a ton of activity the past week in that direction.
[03:35:42.398 --> 03:35:57.349]  Oh yeah, there's activity everywhere as they simulate, mainly taking over cities, as the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 97 states, that now Homeland Security and Brigade Homeland, NORTHCOM, main job is to suppress governors and legislatures.
[03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:58.470]  It's stated!
[03:35:58.470 --> 03:36:00.852]  And then who is the legislature going to call on?
[03:36:00.852 --> 03:36:01.853]  Vets!
[03:36:01.853 --> 03:36:02.933]  Number one enemy.
[03:36:02.933 --> 03:36:07.237]  I mean, if that doesn't prove the government's rogue and illegitimate, my friend, what does?
[03:36:08.075 --> 03:36:09.456]  Well, I agree.
[03:36:09.456 --> 03:36:15.780]  And also, just talked to a lady friend this morning whose nephew was just called up.
[03:36:15.780 --> 03:36:18.742]  Uh, said there was a bunch of them called up.
[03:36:18.742 --> 03:36:20.403]  Not going to the Middle East.
[03:36:20.403 --> 03:36:21.524]  Don't know what they're doing.
[03:36:21.524 --> 03:36:25.266]  So those are the two tidbits that I've got.
[03:36:25.578 --> 03:36:41.266]  Well, first to go, last to know, they're admitting that they're trying to train large portions of the regular army force for the last three years, NMP, military police, search and cordon, and they're doing drills from Missouri to California in the newspaper.
[03:36:41.266 --> 03:36:44.908]  I showed it yesterday, of fighting American gun owners.
[03:36:44.908 --> 03:36:46.309]  Did you see those articles I covered?
[03:36:49.119 --> 03:36:52.702]  I caught a lot yesterday, but I didn't get everything.
[03:36:52.702 --> 03:36:53.203]  No, sir.
[03:36:53.203 --> 03:36:54.344]  No, no, I don't blame you.
[03:36:54.344 --> 03:36:59.288]  It's a four-hour show with an obnoxious pumpkin head directing it, but I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:36:59.288 --> 03:37:00.649]  Good to hear from you.
[03:37:00.649 --> 03:37:02.971]  Look, again, I don't have all the answers, folks.
[03:37:02.971 --> 03:37:05.333]  I'm not the end-all, be-all.
[03:37:05.333 --> 03:37:07.675]  I'm just here pointing out the insanity taking place.
[03:37:07.675 --> 03:37:09.397]  23.7 trill stolen.
[03:37:09.397 --> 03:37:10.638]  They've sucked us dry.
[03:37:10.638 --> 03:37:13.741]  They plan to fully implode the economy, and then they're running all these
[03:37:15.687 --> 03:37:30.727]  Deceptive headlines like home prices index up for first time in three years and then what it says is the decline slowed because it's bottoming out.
[03:37:32.816 --> 03:37:35.758]  But the deceptive headline says up.
[03:37:35.758 --> 03:37:38.600]  But then you read the article, everything's falling apart.
[03:37:38.600 --> 03:37:40.842]  I mean, again, they're telling you inflation's down.
[03:37:40.842 --> 03:37:42.343]  Everybody knows everything costs more.
[03:37:42.343 --> 03:37:43.083]  Let me ask the guys.
[03:37:43.083 --> 03:37:45.285]  Does everything cost more, it seems like?
[03:37:45.285 --> 03:37:49.168]  I mean, do you believe the news saying things cost less, or do they cost more?
[03:37:52.935 --> 03:37:55.517]  Home price index up for the first time in three years.
[03:37:55.517 --> 03:38:05.265]  Index of 20 major cities rises on a monthly basis for the first time since July 2006, hinting that the worst of the declines may be over.
[03:38:05.265 --> 03:38:07.867]  Heard green shoots six months ago, remember?
[03:38:07.867 --> 03:38:13.432]  And again, I hope things will get better, but the globalists have every intention in their own documents.
[03:38:13.432 --> 03:38:16.774]  You got the Dennis Kucinich clip where they're admitting that
[03:38:17.577 --> 03:38:21.558]  The Federal Reserve paid banks not to lend and that lending's gone down?
[03:38:21.558 --> 03:38:30.520]  They could have paid all the mortgages in the country twice over and had $5 trillion left on a 23.7 trill.
[03:38:30.520 --> 03:38:32.521]  All the mortgages, $9.4 trillion.
[03:38:32.521 --> 03:38:34.401]  All of them, not the ones in trouble.
[03:38:34.401 --> 03:38:35.122]  All of them.
[03:38:35.122 --> 03:38:39.603]  Every condo, every mansion, every... everything.
[03:38:39.603 --> 03:38:40.263]  Go ahead and play this.
[03:38:42.503 --> 03:38:50.971]  Your report about lending where you talk about how banks have been leveraging TARP funds to support lending activities.
[03:38:52.766 --> 03:39:02.752]  And you say on commercial lending, 20% of respondents reported they used TARP funding for commercial lending activities.
[03:39:02.752 --> 03:39:06.794]  17% of respondents deploying TARP funds for other consumer lending.
[03:39:06.794 --> 03:39:09.296]  13% for small business.
[03:39:09.296 --> 03:39:19.782]  You talk about the capital cushion, how some banks are basically parking their funds to create a cushion against loan losses.
[03:39:19.782 --> 03:39:20.803]  Now, I looked at your report.
[03:39:21.758 --> 03:39:27.916]  And I want to use that report as a backdrop for a news report that came in today.
[03:39:29.397 --> 03:39:31.979]  Now, we went back into the TARP history here.
[03:39:31.979 --> 03:39:37.783]  We know the first intent that Congress had, purchase toxic assets, which were mortgage-backed securities.
[03:39:37.783 --> 03:39:39.404]  We were told, keep people in their homes.
[03:39:39.404 --> 03:39:43.266]  Well, the administration threw that out the door, last administration.
[03:39:43.266 --> 03:39:51.332]  Then, we were told, we're going to switch the TARP funds to help bail out the banks, direct capital infusion.
[03:39:52.284 --> 03:40:00.712]  But I think something else has happened here, and I want to make sure it doesn't escape this committee, and I hope that you can tell me it hasn't escaped your notice.
[03:40:00.712 --> 03:40:04.336]  We're now seeing that we have another switch that's occurred.
[03:40:04.336 --> 03:40:12.043]  That we actually have the Fed paying banks not to use their, quote, excess capital to make loans.
[03:40:12.043 --> 03:40:14.165]  I direct your attention to a news report today.
[03:40:15.051 --> 03:40:29.283]  Which says that banks' excess reserves at the Fed rose to a record $877.1 billion daily average in the two weeks ended May 20th from $2 billion a year.
[03:40:29.283 --> 03:40:30.044]  It goes on and on.
[03:40:30.044 --> 03:40:32.686]  It's up on InfoWars.com, up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:40:32.686 --> 03:40:33.867]  There's four more minutes.
[03:40:33.867 --> 03:40:41.114]  And I can give you all the mainstream news articles on it, or you can go to StartPage.com, a search engine, and punch it in and find it all right there.
[03:40:43.117 --> 03:40:46.358]  Just Google Federal Reserve paying banks not to loan.
[03:40:46.358 --> 03:40:49.680]  Yeah, Federal Reserve paying its own banks.
[03:40:49.680 --> 03:40:54.322]  The Federal Reserve is a holding front company for private banks.
[03:40:54.322 --> 03:41:00.204]  Now, I told you this back in October, because they've done this in the third world all over and over again.
[03:41:00.204 --> 03:41:04.286]  They plunge the economy, get a bailout, hoard the money,
[03:41:05.290 --> 03:41:18.093]  Till everything implodes, then they're gonna dump the money on the market, buying everything up, while it still has value, then it's devalued once the money finally gets in your hands in the economy.
[03:41:18.093 --> 03:41:24.815]  Because their argument is, this money can only be at institutional level, it can't hit the street, or it'll cause inflation.
[03:41:24.815 --> 03:41:25.735]  Comprende?
[03:41:27.662 --> 03:41:33.864]  That's why they're buying seaports and roads and technology companies and things like that.
[03:41:33.864 --> 03:41:35.364]  And weapon systems.
[03:41:35.364 --> 03:41:40.126]  Because you're not supposed to get your own stinking money!
[03:41:40.126 --> 03:41:47.328]  And then as if that fraud wasn't enough, you pay interest to the banks on the money you gave them!
[03:41:47.328 --> 03:41:53.970]  My God, imagine if you're a con artist and you thought up the most insane fraud you could of how to rip the biggest idiots off.
[03:41:53.970 --> 03:41:54.410]  This is it!
[03:41:55.708 --> 03:42:03.993]  It's like New Jersey, where hundreds of government officials are selling organs, and stealing money from things, and mayors, and the whole country's like this!
[03:42:03.993 --> 03:42:09.096]  I mean, I just... I mean, it's just... And then Kucinich and Ron Paul get attacked by the media.
[03:42:09.096 --> 03:42:13.959]  They're the bad guys, because they're talking... There's the bad man, right there!
[03:42:13.959 --> 03:42:15.540]  Here's the bad man!
[03:42:15.540 --> 03:42:22.545]  Got the news media basically parachuting in on me, attacking me every day, you know, because I don't like being raped by foreign banks.
[03:42:22.545 --> 03:42:23.806]  Okay, let's blitz through calls.
[03:42:24.682 --> 03:42:26.923]  Ryan in Wisconsin, come on down!
[03:42:26.923 --> 03:42:29.485]  Hi Alex.
[03:42:29.485 --> 03:42:30.466]  Hey!
[03:42:30.466 --> 03:42:39.471]  Is the hype about the United States Corporation Act of 1871 a bunch of bull?
[03:42:39.471 --> 03:42:46.155]  Specifically, I have to pull that up, but a lot of that is true, some of it isn't.
[03:42:46.155 --> 03:42:53.180]  They also say things like, you know, this company or that company or this government agency is really a private corporation and
[03:42:54.178 --> 03:42:58.800]  They operate as private corporations, but they have one foot in government, one foot out of government.
[03:42:58.800 --> 03:43:00.701]  It's a quasi.
[03:43:00.701 --> 03:43:05.724]  But it is true the District of Columbia does operate as a corporation.
[03:43:05.724 --> 03:43:19.451]  But it has feet in both the Republic and in the country and in its own corporate system.
[03:43:19.451 --> 03:43:21.111]  Does that answer your question?
[03:43:21.111 --> 03:43:22.192]  Is there two governments?
[03:43:24.497 --> 03:43:26.138]  Well, there's more than two governments.
[03:43:26.138 --> 03:43:37.705]  I mean, you now have the private bureaucracies that openly tie into private corporations that are now the real government, and they operate under continuity of government laws and through the National Security Council.
[03:43:37.705 --> 03:43:39.526]  I appreciate your call.
[03:43:39.526 --> 03:43:42.828]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Missouri.
[03:43:42.828 --> 03:43:44.929]  Robert, you're on the air.
[03:43:44.929 --> 03:43:45.609]  Hello?
[03:43:45.609 --> 03:43:46.490]  Yes, sir.
[03:43:46.490 --> 03:43:47.650]  Hey.
[03:43:47.650 --> 03:43:50.552]  I'm just wanting to tell you that I've listened to you for a long time.
[03:43:52.267 --> 03:43:57.591]  I'm one of them survivors from the 70s, or mid-70s, uh, CPS.
[03:43:57.591 --> 03:44:00.392]  Kidnapping children.
[03:44:00.392 --> 03:44:05.356]  Um, and I'm telling you, they kidnap you and they rewire your brain.
[03:44:05.356 --> 03:44:07.137]  You can't even think right anymore.
[03:44:08.015 --> 03:44:12.641]  Well no, they admit that some states, 76% are on drugs.
[03:44:12.641 --> 03:44:17.688]  On average, 68% of children they grab, they put on 7 drugs on average.
[03:44:17.688 --> 03:44:22.094]  And there's been doctors in the news in Texas, WAI-TV did a great report, you can Google it.
[03:44:22.995 --> 03:44:23.335]  I don't
[03:44:48.974 --> 03:44:50.675]  And you'll see, all over the country.
[03:44:50.675 --> 03:44:52.016]  I mean, they kill them!
[03:44:52.016 --> 03:44:57.719]  They give them, in a month, pesticide, and then they chain them down, they try to escape, and they murder them!
[03:44:57.719 --> 03:44:59.600]  I mean, they just murder!
[03:44:59.600 --> 03:45:05.343]  They take the organs, it's just murder, killing, death, frothing, doing whatever they want.
[03:45:05.343 --> 03:45:12.146]  You cannot imagine how, because people won't believe the evil's going on, so the evil just has free reign.
[03:45:12.146 --> 03:45:16.549]  The devil's biggest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist, and boy, these are human devils that are out there.
[03:45:19.417 --> 03:45:20.838]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[03:45:20.838 --> 03:45:21.759]  Chris, you're on the air.
[03:45:21.759 --> 03:45:23.840]  Go ahead.
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:44.554]  Hey, I'd like to talk about the de facto versus the de jure government that I've had a victory on, but more importantly, since I have less than a minute probably, there's one remedy that is clinically proven effective, not only against the side effects of the various vaccinations that cause the hemorrhagic fever, but also flus cause hemorrhagic fever.
[03:45:45.515 --> 03:45:46.156]  No, you're right.
[03:45:46.156 --> 03:45:56.150]  And again, for those that don't know what hemorrhagic fever is, explain, it causes an autoimmune response, then the lungs fill with the liquid, you're being killed by the vaccines, they know it and don't care!
[03:45:57.045 --> 03:45:59.827]  Yes, and colostrum is that remedy.
[03:45:59.827 --> 03:46:02.449]  I've read a whole lot about colostrum.
[03:46:02.449 --> 03:46:09.535]  Those with healthy immune systems are often more vulnerable to some kinds of flu, which can kill fewer by the complications of the infection.
[03:46:09.535 --> 03:46:11.176]  Because you're getting hemorrhagic fever.
[03:46:11.176 --> 03:46:15.400]  Hemorrhagic tends to hit people with healthy immunes, the more healthy immune systems.
[03:46:16.341 --> 03:46:16.762]  Thank you.
[03:46:36.526 --> 03:46:49.936]  Hey, sounds like great info!
[03:46:49.936 --> 03:46:52.918]  Write an article about it from your perspective, citing medical research.
[03:46:52.918 --> 03:46:54.760]  I know a lot of that's been cited.
[03:46:54.760 --> 03:46:56.921]  And send it to writers at InfoWars.com.
[03:46:56.921 --> 03:46:57.762]  Thank you so much.
[03:46:57.762 --> 03:47:00.985]  Remember, me going quickly to calls is what enables me to get others on.
[03:47:01.869 --> 03:47:04.830]  That's why you guys are getting on the show today, and we love talking to you.
[03:47:04.830 --> 03:47:08.191]  Let's talk to Tony in Maryland, and then Lola.
[03:47:08.191 --> 03:47:09.751]  Tony, go ahead.
[03:47:09.751 --> 03:47:11.432]  How you doing?
[03:47:11.432 --> 03:47:13.773]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[03:47:13.773 --> 03:47:15.893]  I got your Don't Try to Own Me shirt on.
[03:47:15.893 --> 03:47:21.075]  I'm wearing it down here to try to see if I can't find the NLE09.
[03:47:21.075 --> 03:47:23.936]  Again, the t-shirts are really spreading the word.
[03:47:23.936 --> 03:47:25.536]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[03:47:25.536 --> 03:47:26.337]  Thanks for reminding me.
[03:47:26.337 --> 03:47:27.197]  I hadn't plugged those yet.
[03:47:27.932 --> 03:47:29.412]  I got a couple the other night.
[03:47:29.412 --> 03:47:31.613]  The 1776 is the answer, the 1984.
[03:47:31.613 --> 03:47:38.215]  And then there was another one, Save the USA.
[03:47:38.215 --> 03:47:40.296]  Anyway, that's beside the fact.
[03:47:40.296 --> 03:47:44.217]  I was trying to look and see if there was any FEMA drills going on here.
[03:47:44.727 --> 03:47:46.429]  in Washington, D.C.
[03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:48.531]  and I'm not sure where they're at.
[03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:08.491]  Terrorism drill and the name of your city and then you'll see it.
[03:48:08.491 --> 03:48:13.694]  But take Camp Mabry and the stuff going on there and other stuff going on in Waco we've confirmed is going on.
[03:48:13.694 --> 03:48:15.434]  That is nowhere in the news.
[03:48:15.434 --> 03:48:20.617]  So where I live, this is going on, but it's not in the news.
[03:48:20.617 --> 03:48:25.039]  Okay, I know a guy that was in Waco.
[03:48:25.039 --> 03:48:33.003]  He was one of the planners and I see him all the time and I was like, hey, you know, you had special forces in the rear firing on the people.
[03:48:33.579 --> 03:48:34.600]  And he said, oh yeah, I know.
[03:48:51.528 --> 03:48:52.408]  On video.
[03:48:52.408 --> 03:48:59.972]  But because it's black and white, they said, well... That'd be like if you had an elephant in your room, and they said, that's not an elephant.
[03:48:59.972 --> 03:49:04.274]  You're like, well, he's got a trunk and ears and looks like he pooped on the floor right there.
[03:49:04.274 --> 03:49:06.115]  And they're like, nope, there's no elephant.
[03:49:06.115 --> 03:49:11.518]  You know, I mean, it's troops shooting the Davidians on video, the FLIR footage, and they go, no, that's not what it is.
[03:49:11.518 --> 03:49:14.599]  Uh, let's go ahead.
[03:49:14.599 --> 03:49:16.980]  Wake up.
[03:49:16.980 --> 03:49:17.941]  Um, hello?
[03:49:17.941 --> 03:49:19.621]  Yeah, go ahead and finish, sir.
[03:49:19.621 --> 03:49:20.302]  I thought I'd let you go.
[03:49:20.302 --> 03:49:20.602]  Go ahead.
[03:49:21.514 --> 03:49:25.637]  And the funny thing is, I'm right here in front of the American Bar Association.
[03:49:25.637 --> 03:49:28.939]  Is it true that it's the American Barrister Association?
[03:49:28.939 --> 03:49:35.524]  You know, I hear that, and they say it means the accredited bar, British Registry, all that.
[03:49:35.524 --> 03:49:37.825]  And look, I looked into it, couldn't find that.
[03:49:37.825 --> 03:49:39.046]  I appreciate your call.
[03:49:39.046 --> 03:49:45.410]  My whole point is everybody obsesses over all that mythology all day instead of warning people not to take the shots.
[03:49:45.410 --> 03:49:49.213]  Let's talk to Lola in Vegas.
[03:49:49.213 --> 03:49:50.194]  Lola, you're on the air.
[03:49:50.194 --> 03:49:50.494]  Welcome.
[03:49:51.411 --> 03:49:54.293]  Hi Alex, we just love you so much.
[03:49:54.293 --> 03:49:57.195]  We love you Lola.
[03:49:57.195 --> 03:50:00.078]  We've done a lot of things to change and prep for our family.
[03:50:00.078 --> 03:50:10.886]  You know, the other day though, as far as this FEMA exercise, my husband was at the Home Depot and he saw some German soldiers.
[03:50:10.886 --> 03:50:11.947]  They weren't in uniform.
[03:50:11.947 --> 03:50:13.168]  He said, these are military.
[03:50:13.168 --> 03:50:14.709]  He's ex-military.
[03:50:14.709 --> 03:50:15.970]  And they were talking German.
[03:50:15.970 --> 03:50:17.871]  And then the one guy, he didn't respond.
[03:50:17.871 --> 03:50:20.173]  They were almost talking to him.
[03:50:20.173 --> 03:50:21.234]  And then the one guy says,
[03:50:21.761 --> 03:50:23.642]  Let's start the war!
[03:50:23.642 --> 03:50:25.943]  So they're out here doing their exercises.
[03:50:25.943 --> 03:50:31.385]  We noticed a great big Homeland Security building on Pecos Boulevard out here.
[03:50:31.385 --> 03:50:32.206]  This was pretty recent.
[03:50:32.206 --> 03:50:36.348]  Wait a minute, the German soldiers were stomping around shooting their mouths off?
[03:50:36.348 --> 03:50:39.289]  Yeah, right out in the Home Depot parking lot.
[03:50:39.289 --> 03:50:41.410]  So he was talking to them and were they guilty?
[03:50:41.410 --> 03:50:42.430]  He wasn't talking to them.
[03:50:42.430 --> 03:50:45.031]  They were talking real loud so that he could hear.
[03:50:45.031 --> 03:50:48.293]  You know, and then he didn't respond.
[03:50:49.372 --> 03:50:50.574]  And he was busy working.
[03:50:50.574 --> 03:50:53.058]  He's getting a part for his job.
[03:50:53.058 --> 03:50:59.428]  And, uh, so he's like, wow, you know, and then they said, let's start the war in English, you know, and he was patient.
[03:50:59.428 --> 03:51:01.191]  They can't wait to take on the American people.
[03:51:02.028 --> 03:51:05.449]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[03:51:05.449 --> 03:51:09.871]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[03:51:09.871 --> 03:51:12.392]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[03:51:12.392 --> 03:51:18.655]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[03:51:18.655 --> 03:51:25.038]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[03:51:26.238 --> 03:51:28.479]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[03:51:28.479 --> 03:51:35.862]  Introducing Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 super fruits, seed vegetables, and antioxidants.
[03:51:35.862 --> 03:51:38.023]  You know, you work hard for your money.
[03:51:38.023 --> 03:51:40.605]  Isn't it time to start getting what you pay for?
[03:51:40.605 --> 03:51:41.245]  Order today!
[03:51:41.425 --> 03:51:41.665]  1-800-210-1922.
[03:51:41.665 --> 03:51:48.474]  With Choose for Health, your body gets to keep the nutrients you swallow.
[03:51:48.474 --> 03:51:54.902]  The first 300 callers are going to receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced Diet.
[03:51:54.902 --> 03:51:55.022]  1-800-210-1922.

[03:52:02.378 --> 03:52:08.185]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.185 --> 03:52:15.794]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[03:52:15.794 --> 03:52:21.942]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:22.362 --> 03:52:24.343]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:24.343 --> 03:52:26.823]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.823 --> 03:52:38.407]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.407 --> 03:52:40.087]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.087 --> 03:52:41.948]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.948 --> 03:52:48.170]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.832 --> 03:52:57.103]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.103 --> 03:52:58.685]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.685 --> 03:52:59.887]  The people strike back!
[03:53:02.455 --> 03:53:07.960]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[03:53:07.960 --> 03:53:08.761]  and the world.
[03:53:08.761 --> 03:53:12.625]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[03:53:12.625 --> 03:53:19.131]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[03:53:19.131 --> 03:53:21.153]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[03:53:21.153 --> 03:53:26.398]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish.
[03:53:26.578 --> 03:53:29.381]  With double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[03:53:29.381 --> 03:53:34.086]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[03:53:34.086 --> 03:53:39.892]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[03:53:39.892 --> 03:53:41.814]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[03:53:42.054 --> 03:53:42.254]  We're good.
[03:54:17.860 --> 03:54:22.081]  Retransmissions coming up in about five and a half minutes.
[03:54:22.081 --> 03:54:25.222]  Restreamed 24-7 on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:25.222 --> 03:54:30.603]  Don't forget InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:30.603 --> 03:54:32.003]  I want to try to jam in.
[03:54:32.003 --> 03:54:33.283]  Who's up next here on the list?
[03:54:33.283 --> 03:54:35.283]  I got so many calls I can't keep track of them all, John.
[03:54:35.283 --> 03:54:38.344]  Alright, Josh in Oregon and a few others.
[03:54:38.344 --> 03:54:42.245]  We're going to get to you here in just a minute.
[03:54:42.245 --> 03:54:43.485]  I see a John in Oregon.
[03:54:43.485 --> 03:54:44.285]  I don't see a Josh.
[03:54:46.223 --> 03:54:48.206]  John in Oregon, okay.
[03:54:48.206 --> 03:54:57.943]  But before I do that, let me tell you about two more final sponsors and we'll jam in a few final calls here at the end of the transmission.
[03:54:59.946 --> 03:55:04.948]  I always get distracted because I got a TV on with Infowars cover page and all the new headlines Kurt's adding.
[03:55:04.948 --> 03:55:07.468]  It just keeps freaking me out looking across.
[03:55:07.468 --> 03:55:13.790]  NGO suggests elderly should be the first to go in the pandemic and not be given treatment.
[03:55:13.790 --> 03:55:15.651]  And see they're training us all to love eugenics.
[03:55:15.651 --> 03:55:17.412]  That's right, give me the shots!
[03:55:17.412 --> 03:55:18.492]  And the shot hurts you.
[03:55:18.492 --> 03:55:21.053]  See how it's all a sick setup?
[03:55:21.053 --> 03:55:23.133]  Let that old person die, give me the shot!
[03:55:23.133 --> 03:55:27.115]  Of course, it's the young people we want to help especially.
[03:55:27.955 --> 03:55:32.338]  Well, you can't have babies now.
[03:55:32.338 --> 03:55:34.400]  We have a medication for that as well.
[03:55:34.400 --> 03:55:38.042]  Folks, you've got to go to Diginet.net.
[03:55:38.042 --> 03:55:38.923]  Diginet.net.
[03:55:38.923 --> 03:55:43.866]  You know, we've got these catalogs they send us, different companies, and I saw the same pen they sell.
[03:55:45.100 --> 03:55:48.501]  For $140 in one catalog and $197 in another.
[03:55:48.501 --> 03:55:49.501]  The exact same pen.
[03:55:49.501 --> 03:55:53.202]  They have it for like $45 at Diginet.net.
[03:55:53.202 --> 03:55:55.603]  They have little systems that go in your car, hidden cameras.
[03:55:55.603 --> 03:55:56.963]  They have built-in systems.
[03:55:56.963 --> 03:55:59.364]  They have it all at the lowest prices anywhere.
[03:55:59.364 --> 03:56:00.504]  Diginet.net.
[03:56:00.504 --> 03:56:01.464]  This is your witness.
[03:56:01.464 --> 03:56:02.765]  This is what you need.
[03:56:02.765 --> 03:56:06.306]  This is what you need to have in your car, on your person.
[03:56:06.306 --> 03:56:09.026]  They've got a bunch of different systems, all price ranges.
[03:56:09.026 --> 03:56:09.667]  Diginet.net.
[03:56:11.127 --> 03:56:14.008]  That's D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net.
[03:56:14.008 --> 03:56:15.349]  Diginet.net.

[03:56:18.250 --> 03:56:21.031]  In closing, they don't have a lot of classes in the month of August.
[03:56:21.031 --> 03:56:24.292]  That's the hot time outside Pahrump, Nevada.
[03:56:24.292 --> 03:56:30.834]  But, they have a bunch of classes coming up in September, and you want to get in on this special before it ends.
[03:56:30.834 --> 03:56:36.436]  FrontSite.com, world-class premier gun training above law enforcement and military.
[03:56:36.436 --> 03:56:38.197]  Law enforcement and military, go there to tune up.
[03:56:39.037 --> 03:56:40.858]  And no drill instructor attitude.
[03:56:40.858 --> 03:56:43.560]  Diginet.net again is one great sponsor.
[03:56:43.560 --> 03:56:45.561]  FrontSight.com is the other.

[03:56:50.785 --> 03:56:52.286]  FrontSight.com.
[03:56:52.286 --> 03:56:54.487]  They're giving away a free handgun.
[03:56:54.487 --> 03:56:57.069]  Springfield Armory XD in your choice.

[03:57:02.873 --> 03:57:03.073]  It's 75% off.
[03:57:05.316 --> 03:57:06.598]  FrontSight.com.
[03:57:06.598 --> 03:57:09.382]  F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[03:57:09.382 --> 03:57:12.847]  Check out Dr. Ignatius Piazza's offer at FrontSight.com.
[03:57:12.847 --> 03:57:15.271]  Okay, let's jam in two final calls here.
[03:57:15.271 --> 03:57:16.533]  John in Oregon.
[03:57:16.533 --> 03:57:17.574]  Go ahead, John.
[03:57:17.574 --> 03:57:19.016]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:57:19.016 --> 03:57:20.358]  Yes, sir, loud and clear.
[03:57:21.099 --> 03:57:22.080]  All right.
[03:57:22.080 --> 03:57:23.961]  Actually, I was calling the Lars Larson Show.
[03:57:23.961 --> 03:57:33.847]  I want to speak with a congressman, but I'm going to put this out for everybody because I think some of the questions should always be asked of every congressman and every senator.
[03:57:33.847 --> 03:57:40.291]  Are they going to be joining the same medical coverage and programs that we will?
[03:57:42.133 --> 03:57:44.534]  No, they have their own special medical coverage.
[03:57:44.534 --> 03:57:51.456]  They're just going to start fining everybody to get worthless insurance where they're going to give you an aspirin for a heart attack like the Soviet Union.
[03:57:51.456 --> 03:57:52.637]  Appreciate your call.
[03:57:52.637 --> 03:57:54.557]  Glad you found the Lars Larson Show.
[03:57:54.557 --> 03:57:56.238]  Lars Larson.
[03:57:56.238 --> 03:57:57.658]  I've been on his show a few times.
[03:57:57.658 --> 03:57:59.959]  Hell, Peanut had to have me back on.
[03:57:59.959 --> 03:58:01.220]  Let's go ahead... I'm just joking.
[03:58:01.220 --> 03:58:02.820]  He's a nice neocon.
[03:58:02.820 --> 03:58:03.961]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[03:58:05.041 --> 03:58:06.141]  Mike in Minnesota.
[03:58:06.141 --> 03:58:06.782]  Last caller.
[03:58:06.782 --> 03:58:08.242]  Take us out, Mike.
[03:58:08.242 --> 03:58:09.382]  Hey, Alex.
[03:58:09.382 --> 03:58:10.242]  Been a long time.
[03:58:10.242 --> 03:58:14.204]  Last time I called in was New York City when they started the bag searches.
[03:58:14.204 --> 03:58:15.884]  You know, long time listener.
[03:58:15.884 --> 03:58:16.924]  Big supporter.
[03:58:16.924 --> 03:58:17.284]  Well, great!
[03:58:17.284 --> 03:58:17.845]  What's on your mind?
[03:58:17.845 --> 03:58:19.385]  Recommendation to folks.
[03:58:19.385 --> 03:58:20.145]  I'm sorry?
[03:58:20.145 --> 03:58:20.705]  What's on your mind?
[03:58:20.705 --> 03:58:21.926]  We're almost out of time.
[03:58:21.926 --> 03:58:24.746]  Recommendation to folks on the birth issue.
[03:58:24.746 --> 03:58:29.608]  If you don't have it, I have a certificate of why a birth is the same deal they're trying to say is the real deal.
[03:58:29.608 --> 03:58:31.648]  Call and get it.
[03:58:31.648 --> 03:58:32.869]  Case example.
[03:58:32.869 --> 03:58:33.509]  They've sealed it.
[03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:39.055]  You can call and get your own and show people how easy it is to get it.
[03:58:39.055 --> 03:58:40.317]  Oh, that's a great point!
[03:58:40.317 --> 03:58:41.238]  Why are they doing that?
[03:58:41.238 --> 03:58:44.062]  Great point.
