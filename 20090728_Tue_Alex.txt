[01:38.380 --> 01:43.980]  and engaged in a few rants per broadcast and more and more the last few years I've

[08:25.700 --> 08:35.260]  I was in the break room getting a cup of delicious hot steaming coffee and C-span
[08:35.260 --> 08:39.260]  had the minority leader of the Republican Party in the house up there
[08:39.260 --> 08:46.220]  giving a speech and it's set on the screen that Sonia Sotomayor has been
[08:46.220 --> 08:58.820]  approved by a massive massive majority so I will break that down but the Senate
[08:58.820 --> 09:03.940]  Judiciary Committee has approved her nomination to be the newest member to
[09:03.940 --> 09:14.340]  the Supreme Court yeah I have the most ridiculous email in my email box from
[09:14.340 --> 09:25.700]  the Wall Street Journal a reporter asking me is it true that I'm on air saying
[09:25.700 --> 09:33.660]  the government has released the swine flu to stop illegal immigration where
[09:33.660 --> 09:38.660]  do these people get this information the government wants open borders they
[09:38.660 --> 09:43.780]  want to break down the borders of this country and drive down wages so that the
[09:43.780 --> 09:48.980]  poor Latin Americans have nowhere to run for a better life and so that Americans
[09:48.980 --> 09:53.420]  are all destitute and bankrupt and poor they want us poor so we have to join the
[09:53.420 --> 09:59.900]  military and go fighting their wars for empire they want us poor so we're in
[09:59.900 --> 10:03.700]  their system that's in their own documents they want us dependent under
[10:03.700 --> 10:07.980]  their control but I'm gonna have to call the Wall Street Journal up and say where
[10:07.980 --> 10:18.540]  did you get this wild conspiracy theory that I think the government wants the
[10:18.540 --> 10:23.780]  border shut man I tell you these people they will just twist anything and
[10:23.780 --> 10:26.860]  everything you say and do
[10:31.340 --> 10:35.900]  well I want Kurt Nemo or Paul Watson or Aaron Dykes or Steve Watson one of our
[10:35.900 --> 10:41.260]  writers to do a blurb and just point out that she wrote a book saying there's no
[10:41.260 --> 10:44.900]  right to the second amendment we've read from her book the quotes saying
[10:44.900 --> 10:50.580]  there's no individual right to keep their arms and so I get up on air and I
[10:50.580 --> 10:55.660]  say I don't like Sonia Sotomayor because she's an anti-second amendment and the
[10:55.660 --> 11:01.620]  media's answer is if you don't like her you're a racist that's what Politico's
[11:01.620 --> 11:07.740]  got an article out today saying that if you question Barack Obama's birth
[11:07.740 --> 11:13.500]  certificate receipt he's got a receipt of live birth not a birth certificate and
[11:13.500 --> 11:17.940]  if you question the fact that why does the media keep lying and saying that's a
[11:17.940 --> 11:22.740]  birth certificate me thinks you protest too much like they say in Hamlet I
[11:22.740 --> 11:26.980]  didn't even believe this was real a year ago really and now I think something's
[11:26.980 --> 11:31.900]  doing as guilty as they act look like Sylvester with Tweety Bird feathers sticking
[11:31.900 --> 11:36.620]  out of his mouth you know saying he doesn't know where Tweety Bird is and he
[11:36.620 --> 11:45.220]  doesn't like to eat Tweety Birds you'd have to be knocked upside the head by
[11:45.220 --> 11:52.500]  Mike Tyson and his prime seeing Tweety Bird to believe that and that's just
[11:52.500 --> 11:55.380]  everywhere you're just a racist you know you don't want to turn your guns in
[11:55.380 --> 12:00.820]  you're a racist you don't like the fact that Obama has all these different
[12:00.820 --> 12:06.220]  names and different dads and different families and lied and said he didn't go
[12:06.220 --> 12:10.500]  to madrasas and now Braggs and says he did get schooled in madrasas and I'm
[12:10.500 --> 12:16.500]  not here I don't have Islamophobia I'm certainly not some Muslim basher hiding
[12:16.500 --> 12:23.580]  under the bed from them I'm just saying the guy is a liar he's even a liar
[12:23.580 --> 12:31.660]  about being an African that is a black African an indigenous African not a
[12:31.660 --> 12:36.180]  North African who happened to be Middle Easterners who moved in and mixed with
[12:36.180 --> 12:44.820]  the African the Oriental yeah you didn't know that people in Latin America or
[12:44.820 --> 12:51.660]  Oriental and European mix you didn't know people in North Africa or an Oriental
[12:51.660 --> 13:00.260]  Anglo oh gonna be technical Caucasian and Anglo would be a Brett somebody from
[13:00.260 --> 13:04.300]  those aisles Gaelic that's the incredible part is people don't even know
[13:04.300 --> 13:07.740]  where they come from or who they are it just makes my head spin did you know
[13:07.740 --> 13:16.700]  Barack Obama's mama was as white as the side of a I don't know when ice cream
[13:16.700 --> 13:28.860]  truck is white his mama is as white as white flower there you go and his daddy
[13:28.860 --> 13:34.620]  hailed as an black Arab he was part of that sect part of that Muslim sect that
[13:34.620 --> 13:42.100]  feeds on the black Christians he backs up his cousin Odinga who openly runs
[13:42.100 --> 13:46.060]  massive purges burning down churches and driving Christians out of Kenya I
[13:46.060 --> 13:50.740]  mean that's on record this guy's got family I mean you want to actually talk
[13:50.740 --> 13:53.100]  about some Muslims somewhere in the world that are actually killing
[13:53.100 --> 13:57.460]  Christians there's only a few places and it's all in Eastern and North Africa
[13:57.460 --> 14:02.860]  North Eastern Africa and North Africa that's the only place in the world
[14:02.860 --> 14:08.740]  except in a few more tribal operations in Indonesia and that's just tribal
[14:08.740 --> 14:11.740]  groups killing each other they've always been killing each other but the only
[14:11.740 --> 14:19.220]  real place you find Muslims really killing Christians is in a few areas of
[14:19.220 --> 14:23.100]  Eastern and Northern Africa and one of the chief people doing it is Obama's
[14:23.100 --> 14:29.340]  cousin so you bet there's something to him being a Muslim and the type of
[14:29.340 --> 14:33.780]  Muslim that do run around killing Christians they don't kill Christians in
[14:33.780 --> 14:45.940]  the real Muslim countries they basically revere Jesus they think he did rise up
[14:45.940 --> 14:53.020]  into the sky on the Mount of Olives some of the oldest Christian missions in the
[14:53.020 --> 15:02.580]  world are in Iraq and Persia Iran Egypt everywhere else it is asinine but you
[15:02.580 --> 15:07.980]  actually get somebody who is killing Christians and is a Muslim and his name
[15:07.980 --> 15:20.020]  is Barak Hussein Obama oh I just can't take it anymore it is just so insane it
[15:20.020 --> 15:26.540]  is so truth is so much stranger than fiction we got a guy named Barry Cetero
[15:26.540 --> 15:32.700]  his grandma says he was born in Kenya they got a shrine up at his birthplace
[15:32.700 --> 15:36.940]  it's all over the African news he was born there because they're proud of it
[15:36.940 --> 15:41.460]  and you notice the spin has now started started with the White House
[15:41.460 --> 15:50.700]  Press Secretary Gibbs and others that oh he's a citizen well yeah you can be a
[15:50.700 --> 15:55.820]  citizen and not born here but he's not eligible to be president and look again
[15:55.820 --> 15:59.660]  I got a lot of criticism because I wait into this I had some guests on I listen
[15:59.660 --> 16:03.220]  to it but I didn't put in the Obama deception which I think is still good
[16:03.220 --> 16:06.540]  because it covers all the other issues that nobody wants to talk about all the
[16:06.540 --> 16:13.940]  proven stuff the fact that everything he says he do he plays he doesn't 180 but
[16:13.940 --> 16:21.580]  at the same time I don't want to obsess over Barack Obama as a cult of
[16:21.580 --> 16:29.340]  personality with an 84 percent approval rating coming into office writing a
[16:29.340 --> 16:35.060]  wave of success never before seen he was very dangerous controlling the house
[16:35.060 --> 16:43.500]  the Senate and the executive control the legislative and the executive and a lot
[16:43.500 --> 16:50.860]  of courts not the entire judiciary but very close that's the trifecta as Bush
[16:50.860 --> 16:55.620]  would call it both branches of legislative and the executive and then
[16:55.620 --> 16:58.380]  of course the bureaucracy and the National Security Council's the real
[16:58.380 --> 17:02.380]  government so he's got complete control of that and that made him very dangerous
[17:02.380 --> 17:07.980]  so I said we got to stall his agenda expose him but then we can't let the
[17:07.980 --> 17:15.780]  New World Order boomerang around his political gravity well like the Sun and
[17:15.780 --> 17:22.920]  use a false fake Republican Revolution against him because we know the
[17:22.920 --> 17:26.180]  globalist control of both parties and then bring in something just as bad or
[17:26.180 --> 17:31.700]  worse we have to discredit both parties and cause a true restoration of the
[17:31.700 --> 17:35.500]  Bill of Rights and Constitution and point out special interest foreign
[17:35.500 --> 17:39.780]  corporate interest a foreign corporate takeover has happened and discredit the
[17:39.780 --> 17:44.220]  whole system because as long as you let them play WWF wrestling tag team and
[17:44.220 --> 17:47.940]  you know they put a Democrat in and we wake up there a scam and then they put
[17:47.940 --> 17:52.180]  we put a Republican and we wake up that they're a scam and then we wake up that
[17:52.180 --> 17:56.380]  they're a fraud we put a Democrat in ring around the Rosie on and on and on
[17:56.380 --> 18:03.140]  it's so elementary but because it's so elementary it works like a charm and I
[18:03.140 --> 18:06.580]  know you as listeners know this but the public's just now starting to get it Joe
[18:06.580 --> 18:11.260]  the plumber now told the Associated Press and Reuters yesterday it was
[18:11.260 --> 18:15.380]  articles and both publications about it that he sees through both parties and
[18:15.380 --> 18:20.260]  both parties are bad and it's globalism and that it's the carbon tax and that
[18:20.260 --> 18:23.940]  we've got to get control of our government so he was being used as a
[18:23.940 --> 18:29.500]  Republican stooge for McCain who was taking a dive a ringer in this Don
[18:29.500 --> 18:38.620]  King heavyweight ballot and now he's awake and Congress has that 11% approval
[18:38.620 --> 18:44.180]  rating and that's good because they're all a bunch of whores you got a few good
[18:44.180 --> 18:51.100]  people like Ron Paul and Louie Gomer and a few others there's a handful of them
[18:55.220 --> 19:00.620]  and we've got to support them but as long as we get sidetracked with all
[19:00.620 --> 19:04.420]  these diversionary issues of Michael Jackson and I'm sorry another
[19:04.420 --> 19:11.740]  diversionary issue you know the NAACP and Obama and the phony right wing they're
[19:11.740 --> 19:16.900]  all we've got to talk more about race we've got a discount that means have
[19:16.900 --> 19:24.140]  more political power and more racial division and more tribalism for the
[19:24.140 --> 19:30.060]  limousine liberals that pimp all this out that's all that is the tribal
[19:30.060 --> 19:34.780]  politics instead of discussing the economy imploding and the massive job
[19:34.780 --> 19:39.980]  losses and the 23.7 trillion stolen by the private federal reserve in ten
[19:39.980 --> 19:47.140]  months no we've everybody's got a way in about the cops arresting the black

[20:17.780 --> 20:21.540]  these new demands for free services and procedures Medicare and Medicaid are
[20:21.540 --> 20:25.140]  already bankrupt many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by
[20:25.140 --> 20:29.100]  the prospect of forced procedures all this is creating a perfect storm which
[20:29.100 --> 20:33.060]  could create unimaginable shortages in the health care services folks it's
[20:33.060 --> 20:36.660]  time to be prepared for the worst our friends at solutions from science have

[22:11.860 --> 22:16.220]  think all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the
[22:16.220 --> 22:20.220]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while
[22:20.220 --> 22:24.860]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a
[22:24.860 --> 22:29.020]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[22:29.020 --> 22:34.260]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[22:34.260 --> 22:40.740]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government
[22:40.740 --> 22:47.460]  this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his real agenda

[24:24.300 --> 24:30.620]  like children weighing in like it's junior high gossiping around the water
[24:30.620 --> 24:36.420]  fountain during the five-minute break between classes sounds like a bunch of
[24:36.420 --> 24:43.940]  12-year-old girls calling in groveling to the police or groveling to the
[24:43.940 --> 24:49.500]  professor and taking sides and fighting with each other and it's much to do
[24:49.500 --> 24:56.500]  about nothing our whole society is in flux a technological revolution is here
[24:56.500 --> 25:01.220]  the globalists have openly said because of robotics and standardization and
[25:01.220 --> 25:06.420]  production lines that they don't need us anymore the official policy is to at
[25:06.420 --> 25:11.260]  least reduce the world population by 80% and they're now engaging it with
[25:11.260 --> 25:14.460]  weather modification with controlled droughts and admitting they're
[25:14.460 --> 25:17.820]  manipulating the weather but saying the tales are classified they are
[25:17.820 --> 25:22.540]  admittedly poisoning the water and food they're admittedly sterilizing us and I
[25:22.540 --> 25:29.980]  hear these adults calling in about the diversion of the day now some things are
[25:29.980 --> 25:36.220]  diversions but at the same time they're still serious like Sotomayor Sotomayor
[25:36.220 --> 25:40.460]  openly wrote a book and we've written articles about it in info wars in
[25:40.460 --> 25:45.460]  prisonplanet.com saying you have no right to keep and bear arms and in
[25:45.460 --> 25:49.740]  testimony she said I don't know if you have a right now when somebody says I
[25:49.740 --> 25:52.780]  don't know if you have a right to own guns that means she's going to vote
[25:52.780 --> 25:56.380]  against them they're putting somebody on there who's more anti-gun the last
[25:56.380 --> 26:01.900]  person they almost by one vote said no right to keep and bear any arms last
[26:01.900 --> 26:06.580]  year they lost by one vote but they still put in the decision that oh we can
[26:06.580 --> 26:11.300]  still under law restrict your second amendment and now they've had the
[26:11.300 --> 26:16.060]  federal court out in California with the night circuit come out and say yeah we
[26:16.060 --> 26:20.100]  can ban your guns under the second amendment your right means we can take
[26:20.100 --> 26:26.460]  your guns you have a right to hand them in basically well now they got the votes
[26:26.460 --> 26:31.700]  to ban the second amendment look out and I guess if I don't turn in my
[26:31.700 --> 26:36.540]  grandfather's dear rifle that he gave my father that my father gave me I'll be
[26:36.540 --> 26:41.580]  lynched as being against Hispanics see this is mental illness they know the

[33:17.900 --> 33:22.460]  voted to approve Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor to be the first
[33:22.460 --> 33:29.380]  Hispanic Justice the committee voted 13 to 6 Tuesday morning to send Sotomayor
[33:29.380 --> 33:33.340]  nomination to the full Senate where she's expected to be confirmed easily
[33:33.340 --> 33:41.220]  next week quite a few of the Republicans voted for her and remember that
[33:41.220 --> 33:47.140]  means they are anti-gun and this is a lady who's a member of La Raza whose own
[33:47.140 --> 33:51.740]  motto is for those inside the race everything for those outside the race
[33:51.740 --> 33:58.420]  nothing and see I don't like the Ku Klux Klan and I don't like Sonia Sotomayor
[33:58.420 --> 34:04.340]  but see racism is only from whites that's only because whites are some of
[34:04.340 --> 34:08.220]  the middle class and have something for the ultra elite to rob they're gonna
[34:08.220 --> 34:13.340]  get rid of all this whiteies the evil one once they're done destroying any

[34:17.220 --> 34:21.820]  minority majority if there was one white person shaking in a corner being
[34:21.820 --> 34:33.260]  hunted down by wolf packs that would be a you know evil oppressor and that's
[34:33.260 --> 34:38.020]  how the story goes meanwhile they keep saying oh it's no big deal that we want
[34:38.020 --> 34:42.820]  this health care plan it's not socialized health care if you don't buy
[34:42.820 --> 34:48.780]  health insurance they garnish your ways wages between 2500 and $5,000 and
[34:48.780 --> 34:54.780]  that's just a start that's a tax that's a new tax on top of everything else and
[34:54.780 --> 34:58.780]  then the insurance companies are owned by the big banks that's them forcing you
[34:58.780 --> 35:02.500]  but meanwhile the precious illegal aliens because they're there to drive
[35:02.500 --> 35:06.300]  down the wages they get left alone by the police station why when they don't
[35:06.300 --> 35:12.180]  have even driver insurance this is all a sick sick system alright I said I'm gonna

[35:37.380 --> 35:42.460]  it that's like they're making police departments put GPS trackers in their
[35:42.460 --> 35:46.180]  cars to track them so when the feds make everybody else take them which they're
[35:46.180 --> 35:50.140]  now proposing the cops will say hey everybody gets one it's kind of like

[37:13.020 --> 37:20.460]  all the press releases by FEMA all the top links are FEMA while there's a new
[37:20.460 --> 37:26.620]  search engine that I'm trying to promote start page comms is Google quality
[37:26.620 --> 37:29.900]  search but then it doesn't log where you go what you do so I should say start
[37:29.900 --> 37:33.140]  page comm but I have to then point out that means a search engine because
[37:33.140 --> 37:37.980]  Google is now this ubiquitous term in the nomenclature that's why I use that
[37:37.980 --> 37:45.340]  but search engine start page comm go to start page comm and Google NLE09
[37:45.340 --> 37:51.180]  national level exercise 09 that's foreign troops from 14 nations openly
[37:51.180 --> 37:56.700]  training to quote take on American terrorists with Homeland Security 30
[37:56.700 --> 38:02.100]  plus federal agencies 50 state police agencies hundreds of local city agencies
[38:02.100 --> 38:06.220]  and other volunteer community groups and you go look at those groups those are
[38:06.220 --> 38:14.940]  local tattletale squads including youth brigade Eagle scouts training to assist
[38:14.940 --> 38:20.860]  in quote taking on and killing veterans in seeking destroy missions out of
[38:20.860 --> 38:24.340]  control veterans and the number one threat of Homeland Security is veterans
[38:24.340 --> 38:33.580]  I mean you can't make this up and then also want to discuss the flu so the
[38:33.580 --> 38:44.180]  mayor NLE09 first-time callers and we'll take first-time callers as I'm
[38:44.180 --> 38:48.540]  getting to him late into the next hour so the half hour then we'll open the
[38:48.540 --> 38:53.980]  phones up for free for all for everybody at 1-800-259-9231 Paul in
[38:53.980 --> 39:01.540]  Alabama Paul go ahead you're on the air John P. Holdren bad man flu shot bad
[39:01.540 --> 39:07.740]  chemical yes anyhow here's a couple of words from the Birmingham was going on
[39:07.740 --> 39:14.660]  around us where I work at I work at a hospital I don't deal with patients but
[39:14.660 --> 39:20.820]  it is required mandatory for me to get a flu shot in order to keep my job so we're
[39:20.820 --> 39:24.460]  gonna see how that plays out well let me just stop because I want to hear more
[39:24.460 --> 39:27.780]  from you on this I have a stack of mainstream news articles they're all
[39:27.780 --> 39:31.740]  linked up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com on today's kind of
[39:31.740 --> 39:36.020]  on-air bibliography that we have forever for the listeners each day but it's AP
[39:36.020 --> 39:41.700]  Reuters New York Times so what he's saying is true they're saying all first
[39:41.700 --> 39:47.620]  responders police firemen nurses medical workers janitors and hospitals next
[39:47.620 --> 39:53.300]  county workers state workers you've all got to take it but there's no law they're
[39:53.300 --> 39:59.540]  just selectively enforcing under Obama's executive order that he reauthorized
[39:59.540 --> 40:03.900]  from Bush it's originally Bush's executive order you just Google executive
[40:03.900 --> 40:10.220]  order quarantine force inoculation or startpage.com that and you can read the
[40:10.220 --> 40:14.500]  executive order for that but still it's a load of bull they can sign an executive
[40:14.500 --> 40:20.020]  order saying I got to go you know lick the the boots of Obama or kiss the
[40:20.020 --> 40:25.060]  hind end of George W. Bush doesn't mean I have to you know they tried this with
[40:25.060 --> 40:30.740]  the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act in 2002 with 14 million first
[40:30.740 --> 40:36.060]  responders and they said no so I mean well I'm gonna shut up tell folks what
[40:36.060 --> 40:40.580]  they're telling you in your hospital and what's going on. Well they're saying that I
[40:40.580 --> 40:45.620]  have to get the shot unless I can get a doctor's exemption from the doctor. Well
[40:45.620 --> 40:50.460]  you know if you look at any medical form there's three exemptions you can have
[40:50.460 --> 40:55.560]  and one of them is an excuse from a doctor one of them is a religious
[40:55.560 --> 40:59.820]  exemption and the third is a cultural exemption they have totally blown the
[40:59.820 --> 41:07.340]  other two exemptions off. Now my state has does not seem to recognize a cultural
[41:07.340 --> 41:13.100]  exemption anyways all you can get for exemption forms are one from a doctor and
[41:13.100 --> 41:18.100]  one because of religious so I'm not sure how that's gonna play out for me on
[41:18.100 --> 41:24.500]  that I think I was subject early in life to some of the NWO chemicals and I had
[41:24.500 --> 41:30.860]  an idiocratic disease as a baby so that maybe that maybe I can use that. But your
[41:30.860 --> 41:34.260]  body defeated it you know that's the point parents give their kids shots it
[41:34.260 --> 41:38.780]  messes them up if you'll just stop injecting them lunatics they'll survive
[41:38.780 --> 41:42.820]  but if you want them to die of leukemia or die of bone cancer or die of brain
[41:42.820 --> 41:47.140]  cancer if you like lowering little kids into holes just keep it up psychos
[41:47.140 --> 41:52.020]  because eugenicist Holdren openly once you dead he said it on record these
[41:52.020 --> 41:57.540]  people aren't playing games why won't folks believe them it's in the memorandum
[41:57.540 --> 42:02.940]  200 State Department it's in the 1996 biological diversity assessment UN it's
[42:02.940 --> 42:08.820]  in the club of Rome it's in thousands of white papers it's real I'm sorry reality
[42:08.820 --> 42:14.740]  is scary but we told you in the studies that the Gardasil was killing girls and
[42:14.740 --> 42:21.780]  women and now it's all over the news and listen this is all color of law they
[42:21.780 --> 42:24.780]  tell medical workers you have to do it they tell you you have to have the
[42:24.780 --> 42:32.820]  exemption there is no law it's the same color of law where they tell kids you've
[42:32.820 --> 42:38.460]  got to have shots to go to school it's their policy and generally if you just
[42:38.460 --> 42:43.100]  ignore it and never get around to the shot they'll kind of let it go into the
[42:43.100 --> 42:47.700]  radar and then so many people refuse that they can't fire everybody so what
[42:47.700 --> 42:52.980]  you do is you go talk to your friends after work you give them literature
[42:52.980 --> 42:58.380]  about it you pull up the LA Times article from 2003 where they ordered 14
[42:58.380 --> 43:01.940]  million to take it because most people are sheep like so if they see a group
[43:01.940 --> 43:07.500]  saying no they'll say no and go here's Tommy Thompson in 2003 wouldn't take the
[43:07.500 --> 43:12.740]  smallpox shot and so medical workers and doctors all said no and it fell through
[43:12.740 --> 43:18.580]  so all you do is go don't you remember last time we said no don't you
[43:18.580 --> 43:24.380]  understand that that they admit I would create a packet of fact sheet that
[43:24.380 --> 43:27.740]  they're already admitting that this flu vaccine won't even cover the new
[43:27.740 --> 43:31.380]  mutation that's already happened for this supposed flu that isn't even that
[43:31.380 --> 43:38.020]  dangerous and if you can get 10% to say no they'll cancel the whole thing and so
[43:38.020 --> 43:43.220]  but on top of that the military they try to lie to them and say you don't have
[43:43.220 --> 43:46.380]  any rights you have to take it you don't have to take experimental shots this is
[43:46.380 --> 43:50.300]  an experimental shot even if you were in the military but see the troops don't
[43:50.300 --> 43:57.460]  know that so they lie to them this is such an important heavy issue but all I
[43:57.460 --> 44:03.220]  can tell you is that my dad doesn't take the hep shots he's a dentist this is a
[44:03.220 --> 44:08.900]  load of bull and so they try to stampede people into doing it go ahead yeah if
[44:08.900 --> 44:12.660]  you're a nurse going to nursing school you don't have to take that hep shot you
[44:12.660 --> 44:16.780]  do not have to take it you can say religious or cultural exemption and
[44:16.780 --> 44:19.860]  they'll just look at you don't found it or scream at you like a body snatcher
[44:19.860 --> 44:24.380]  but they still can't make you take it that's where I'm at right now this is
[44:24.380 --> 44:29.500]  the first time I've ever seen it put to me that you have to take the shot so this
[44:29.500 --> 44:34.420]  is pretty and I can you know if you'd like I'll send you the you know that the
[44:34.420 --> 44:38.660]  decree as you would have yeah email it well I mean it's in the news but it's
[44:38.660 --> 44:40.980]  good to have the decree because listeners still deny that even when they
[44:40.980 --> 44:44.460]  have AP telling them but of course telling them how wonderful it is send it
[44:44.460 --> 44:50.620]  to Aaron with two a's and info wars.com or show tips and info wars.com and one
[44:50.620 --> 44:54.140]  other thing really quickly about the police state going down here in the
[44:54.140 --> 45:00.860]  ham of Alabama that's Magic City they have they're having not police but SWAT
[45:00.860 --> 45:06.380]  teams SWAT teams in the black parts of town are setting up roadblocks checking
[45:06.380 --> 45:09.860]  people's IDs you can't turn if you try to turn around they're coming after you
[45:09.860 --> 45:13.580]  you know stepping around the town when they're in there in their boots and
[45:13.580 --> 45:18.060]  their combat boots and all black uniforms so yeah that's why they're
[45:18.060 --> 45:22.900]  converting they're converting some police departments to 20% SWAT or
[45:22.900 --> 45:28.780]  auxiliary SWAT this is going to be the paramilitary force that rules America I
[45:28.780 --> 45:38.260]  appreciate your call it's in State Department document 7277 from 1962 and
[45:38.260 --> 45:42.980]  they want worldwide special pill paramilitary type SWAT teams they don't
[45:42.980 --> 45:46.660]  describe them as special weapons and tactics at that time but it but it
[45:46.660 --> 45:51.740]  describes the uniform everything and the rest of police are gonna be like
[45:51.740 --> 45:56.540]  social workers that inspect your house and boss you around and steal your kids
[45:56.540 --> 46:00.060]  in the minute you say no they're gonna pull back and they're gonna roll up
[46:00.060 --> 46:06.460]  with armored vehicles and just burn your house down and that's the system period
[46:06.460 --> 46:10.980]  and a lot of SWAT teams are like don't you attack us hey you individually may
[46:10.980 --> 46:15.700]  not be evil but I've seen it for a decade SWAT teams running roadblocks SWAT
[46:15.700 --> 46:20.740]  teams take Illinois going door-to-door quote demanding to be let in to
[46:20.740 --> 46:26.380]  investigate people's guns without warrants this is tyranny period and you
[46:26.380 --> 46:32.100]  know it you know it and the police who aren't for this you better speak up and
[46:32.100 --> 46:38.420]  say no let's go ahead and talk to Donna in Ohio Donna go ahead hi Alex I've been
[46:38.420 --> 46:44.220]  listening to you since pretty much close to last last Christmas I went to check
[46:44.220 --> 46:48.460]  my short way to see if it worked down here in the basement in case we had to
[46:48.460 --> 46:53.900]  come down you know anytime when there was a storm or anything and and here I
[46:53.900 --> 47:00.260]  got you on the on the short way and I believe you I believe you ever since the
[47:00.260 --> 47:05.620]  first time I heard you and I'll tell you I've been like a repellent to all my
[47:05.620 --> 47:11.340]  friends and family and well there were a lot of people in Nazi Germany who got
[47:11.340 --> 47:15.940]  laughed at a St. Hitler was bad but we're all being driven right so you're
[47:15.940 --> 47:22.380]  doing a great job I was over and went out for breakfast by myself and I heard
[47:22.380 --> 47:29.060]  people talking about the flu shot about getting sick and different things and I
[47:29.060 --> 47:32.620]  went up to him there were six men sitting there and I don't know where I got
[47:32.620 --> 47:38.020]  the guts but I went up to him and I told him about the flu shot and the one guy
[47:38.020 --> 47:41.220]  told the other guy don't pay any attention to her don't talk to her maybe
[47:41.220 --> 47:48.620]  she'll go away so I've been getting a lot of that and I'll tell you what though
[47:48.620 --> 47:57.860]  I do have two friends of mine that almost think the same way I do and some
[47:57.860 --> 48:03.900]  some of my family don't believe everything I say but I do believe that
[48:03.900 --> 48:08.300]  they're going to be coming in like in in sections you know what I mean right now
[48:08.300 --> 48:14.780]  we are not we feel like we're not getting through to a lot of people and it
[48:14.780 --> 48:21.940]  just stresses us out but I feel like God has an army and the ones that are in the
[48:21.940 --> 48:29.660]  front lines like you are right now are and then the ones that know about this
[48:29.660 --> 48:35.260]  and believe it they're in the front lines and then gradually they'll be grow
[48:35.260 --> 48:41.020]  you know things happening where more people will when they see things
[48:41.020 --> 48:48.420]  happening that we've told them will start believing and I do believe that I
[48:48.420 --> 48:54.100]  hear a lot of people saying you're the leader and I do believe that and I'm
[48:54.100 --> 48:58.300]  older than you and I'm going to tell you that you are you're the only one that
[48:58.300 --> 49:04.060]  they trust because everything that you said is true I mean not the only one
[49:04.060 --> 49:08.660]  but there's other ones out there on the shortwave that are saying the same thing
[49:08.660 --> 49:12.700]  that you are but most of them are too worldly most of them are too worldly
[49:12.700 --> 49:15.780]  and they're doing it for some of the wrong reasons and they let their message
[49:15.780 --> 49:20.340]  be tainted by infighting because they want to be number one and those that
[49:20.340 --> 49:23.700]  want to be number one don't normally become number one or anything close to
[49:23.700 --> 49:28.780]  it and it's a it's a sad fact that a lot of people have missed the whole issue
[49:28.780 --> 49:34.740]  just becoming obsessed over Alex Jones but God bless you and it's been great
[49:34.740 --> 49:40.620]  hearing from you Donna we're all leaders in this fight and the point you
[49:40.620 --> 49:45.460]  brought up about sectors and sections yes we're all planting seeds a lot of
[49:45.460 --> 49:49.740]  people will laugh at you at first but down the road they will remember what
[49:49.740 --> 49:54.100]  you told them or they may not even remember but they'll they'll have a
[49:54.100 --> 50:00.020]  memory of the information but speaking of checkpoints and sectors like what
[50:00.020 --> 50:05.260]  Tony Brown has said many times on this show black writer and commentator TV
[50:05.260 --> 50:08.700]  host out of Chicago what you see in the black community being done will be done
[50:08.700 --> 50:12.300]  in your community and that's why that black professor got so angry and got mad
[50:12.300 --> 50:16.820]  he doesn't understand the new police state system where everybody's you know
[50:16.820 --> 50:20.980]  demanded to show their ID and I don't even think the cop was particularly out
[50:20.980 --> 50:25.500]  of line compared to a lot of other you know police forces things have been
[50:25.500 --> 50:29.500]  ratcheted up but a lot of black men do have a chip on their shoulder because
[50:29.500 --> 50:33.660]  they do get harassed I mean I've watched it in public places I've seen it as a
[50:33.660 --> 50:38.860]  white male I've experienced being treated differently but more and more we
[50:38.860 --> 50:43.980]  get treated really bad and so they set up this martial law in black communities
[50:43.980 --> 50:48.460]  look at all these black mayors in Oklahoma and Arkansas declaring martial
[50:48.460 --> 50:53.500]  law and and making black show IDs to leave their communities they set the
[50:53.500 --> 51:01.860]  precedence in those communities it's very very serious if the current state of
[51:01.860 --> 51:05.940]  the economy is severely impacting your life this might be some of the most
[51:05.940 --> 51:10.260]  important information you will ever hear as the economy continues to spiral out
[51:10.260 --> 51:14.340]  of control many people just like you wonder how they will support their
[51:14.340 --> 51:18.100]  family and pay their bills the government is not going to help out the
[51:18.100 --> 51:22.060]  people who desperately need it it's time for you to look outside the box and

[54:29.500 --> 54:35.180]  that lady was talking and that fellow before just every point they made like
[54:35.180 --> 54:40.820]  a fractal there were thousands of points I wanted to make that's why I
[54:40.820 --> 54:45.380]  always interrupt start chomping at the bit to just confirm what they're saying
[54:45.380 --> 54:51.780]  or add to it or tie it into other things because the picture is so clear when
[54:51.780 --> 54:58.620]  you in-depth study this year after year day after day just constantly but

[55:02.540 --> 55:06.620]  didn't say she sees these six men you know how they'll do sitting around on a
[55:06.620 --> 55:14.940]  park bench or sitting around by the coke machines babbling and imagine walking
[55:14.940 --> 55:20.620]  up to those old men I'm guessing they're old I mean might have been young men
[55:20.620 --> 55:27.180]  sitting around talking and saying hey don't take the flu shot it's got a lot
[55:27.180 --> 55:31.180]  of dangerous stuff in it which it killed a whole bunch of people in 76 they
[55:31.180 --> 55:35.860]  shot a bunch of troops up in an army base just like in 1918 some of them died
[55:35.860 --> 55:40.260]  nobody else died except those on the base they of course had the flu shot
[55:40.260 --> 55:44.700]  already made up they killed some of the troops to scare the public shot everybody
[55:44.700 --> 55:51.500]  up thousands and thousands died Gillian Bernays a bunch of other brain
[55:51.500 --> 56:02.980]  disorders on and on and on I mean it's admitted the flu shot killed people and
[56:02.980 --> 56:07.460]  you walk over and tell these ignoramuses and you get laughed at don't talk to her
[56:07.460 --> 56:12.140]  and she'll go away like she was some phantom so a human being having the
[56:12.140 --> 56:18.060]  courage to come over and talk to you you know what Donna could be selfish and
[56:18.060 --> 56:22.860]  lazy like you jackasses you think I want to talk to people in a grocery store
[56:22.860 --> 56:25.980]  you think I don't want to just get my food and go home and hang out with my

[56:46.300 --> 56:52.940]  the TSA lines about how it was a police state I don't care anymore and I don't
[56:52.940 --> 56:59.220]  care if you slack jawed soft un-American pieces of trash laugh at me because I'm

[1:00:13.420 --> 1:00:23.420]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:30.620 --> 1:00:36.100]  if you know the flu vaccines have killed tens of thousands of people
[1:00:36.100 --> 1:00:42.500]  conservatively in the past on record this latest hyped event matches exactly
[1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:48.500]  what happened with the swine flu inoculations in 76 you are fundamentally
[1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:52.860]  warped if you're not warning the public but then you warn the idiots and they
[1:00:52.860 --> 1:00:56.700]  laugh at you it doesn't matter you got to move on to those of the listen let's
[1:00:56.700 --> 1:01:02.300]  continue with your calls Russ in Texas you're on the air Russ good afternoon
[1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:06.180]  Alex thank you very much for taking my call I just want to say that you are
[1:01:06.180 --> 1:01:11.340]  probably the shining example of what really needs to be done and that is to
[1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:15.620]  continue education continue to learn things that we can you know so we can
[1:01:15.620 --> 1:01:19.980]  continue to educate others I've been out talking to people for probably 15 16
[1:01:19.980 --> 1:01:24.460]  years now and I talked to everybody everywhere in any line in the bank or
[1:01:24.460 --> 1:01:30.420]  whatever and I'm finding that probably at least close to half the people that I
[1:01:30.420 --> 1:01:36.660]  speak with are enlightened to some degree of course 10 years ago and 10 years
[1:01:36.660 --> 1:01:41.100]  ago it might have been 15% I mean look we should be more positive I should be
[1:01:41.100 --> 1:01:45.540]  more positive I'm just so disgusted to see the elites up there because see
[1:01:45.540 --> 1:01:53.220]  we're not blind we see them we know the carnage it's it's and we know that this
[1:01:53.220 --> 1:01:57.660]  evil is sitting right next to the good people but the good people are under a
[1:01:57.660 --> 1:02:03.060]  delusion and it's frustrating but look we're getting ready to audit the Fed
[1:02:03.060 --> 1:02:08.020]  everybody's starting to wake up this is so positive praise God I'm sorry go ahead
[1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:13.140]  yeah you're you're a really a terrific example Alex because you you you show

[1:02:21.580 --> 1:02:24.260]  announcement of an upcoming meeting in Dallas this evening

[1:02:37.940 --> 1:02:42.180]  but that's only the beginning of things in Dallas this evening and for all the

[1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:32.140]  about your flu shot and it's just so hard to tell like if you go down to

[1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:41.820]  to happen or you know it's whatever my doctor says yeah they've capitulated they
[1:03:41.820 --> 1:03:46.180]  just say it's of the Lord and not be involved in anything and not be informed

[1:03:52.220 --> 1:03:59.940]  the Lord it's of Satan yeah it's just like how do you get through to them you
[1:03:59.940 --> 1:04:04.420]  know it's like you tell them what is really going on not what they've been
[1:04:04.420 --> 1:04:09.620]  taught and the preacher the pastor won't let you come out and because he's a
[1:04:09.620 --> 1:04:14.660]  wicked devil I mean I'm surprised these preachers haven't grown forked tails I
[1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:21.300]  mean literally they're on FEMA payroll hired secretly to tell their flocks to
[1:04:21.300 --> 1:04:24.060]  submit ma'am stay there I'm gonna have you finish up when we get back we're

[1:08:20.300 --> 1:08:23.860]  alex jones
[1:08:28.060 --> 1:08:35.900]  for those that don't know it is 180 degrees the opposite direction away from
[1:08:35.900 --> 1:08:40.340]  liberty and freedom what this country was founded on to have preachers telling
[1:08:40.340 --> 1:08:44.980]  their flocks lay down to government don't think submit the flu shots nothing
[1:08:44.980 --> 1:08:49.180]  scary just give me money and then you'll have financial success in life it's
[1:08:49.180 --> 1:08:54.460]  voodoo it's witch doctor crap you know these preachers send me a thousand
[1:08:54.460 --> 1:09:01.100]  dollars and I'll send you a prayer cloth that'll that'll heal you or I just
[1:09:01.100 --> 1:09:04.820]  can't handle it and I could play the newscast but I've played them over and
[1:09:04.820 --> 1:09:09.420]  over again we got the secret documents a year and a half before it was mainstream
[1:09:09.420 --> 1:09:12.900]  news pastor butch paw here on the network and myself two separate pastors
[1:09:12.900 --> 1:09:17.180]  FEMA teaching them to prepare their flocks for forced inoculations to go to
[1:09:17.180 --> 1:09:22.500]  FEMA camps to let the state take their children I mean if I was in a church and
[1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:25.780]  my preacher got up and started saying do what government says let them break your
[1:09:25.780 --> 1:09:29.980]  families up take the shots I'd probably want to go punch them in the nose I
[1:09:29.980 --> 1:09:38.420]  would stand up and start rebuking him and if one of the thug gang member
[1:09:38.420 --> 1:09:42.300]  ushers came and put their arm on me I'd probably punch him in the face because
[1:09:42.300 --> 1:09:48.980]  they're in there trying to sell evil and tyranny and forced inoculations and
[1:09:48.980 --> 1:09:56.780]  death I mean folks that is hardcore tyranny I mean that is secret police
[1:09:56.780 --> 1:10:03.300]  whacked out East Germany it doesn't get worse than kids being trained to spy on
[1:10:03.300 --> 1:10:07.500]  their parents and now it's all over the news with the news saying it's good you
[1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:11.580]  know five years ago they'd say oh kids are tattling on their parents is this
[1:10:11.580 --> 1:10:17.420]  good now they say oh isn't it wonderful and the only thing worse is having the
[1:10:17.420 --> 1:10:22.140]  preachers and then we got hundreds of pages of FEMA documents we scanned them
[1:10:22.140 --> 1:10:26.340]  in their own info wars and the thumbs suck in public told us they weren't real
[1:10:26.340 --> 1:10:31.460]  you could call the stinking FEMA numbers on them well then it came out in
[1:10:31.460 --> 1:10:36.060]  national and local TV stations but saying it was good oh the preachers are
[1:10:36.060 --> 1:10:41.180]  preparing everyone to go to camps and take force inoculations and turn their
[1:10:41.180 --> 1:10:46.900]  guns in it's of the Lord don't believe me just search engine just start page
[1:10:46.900 --> 1:10:54.860]  calm that's a good search engine clergy response teams you'll be watching the
[1:10:54.860 --> 1:11:00.380]  news clips not me saying it's bad them saying it's good I'm gonna folks are we
[1:11:00.380 --> 1:11:04.740]  so whacked out as a country that we don't know preachers secretly on
[1:11:04.740 --> 1:11:12.540]  homeland security payroll 20 plus thousand last documents we got 26,000
[1:11:12.540 --> 1:11:16.380]  preachers and all the major denominations telling the people and
[1:11:16.380 --> 1:11:22.900]  then God blessing Raymond T a few years ago came into the show and he gave me
[1:11:22.900 --> 1:11:26.820]  the local Baptist church he was going to a big Baptist church in dripping
[1:11:26.820 --> 1:11:33.900]  springs and it said under 501 C3 rules you are not to discuss the election
[1:11:33.900 --> 1:11:38.900]  it was a midterm 2006 coming up and you're not even talk about it at church
[1:11:38.900 --> 1:11:43.020]  dinners or if you go with friends from church you're not to talk about anything
[1:11:43.020 --> 1:11:49.740]  political that is 180 degrees the opposite of this republic it's so simple
[1:11:49.740 --> 1:11:57.180]  it screams out like a giant red siren oh my god I can't believe it and this is a
[1:11:57.180 --> 1:12:02.660]  big Baptist church he gave me a copy of the document given to all the church I
[1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:06.180]  didn't want me saying the name because you know he's a deacon at the church or
[1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:09.980]  whatever but the point is he was talking about leaving the church at the time I
[1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:14.020]  haven't asked him about that in years but the point is he's out there and and
[1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:18.500]  501 C3 they started in the 50s and they tell the churches oh it's just a little
[1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:24.020]  form you signed for your tax exemption see it's a political trick the first
[1:12:24.020 --> 1:12:28.940]  amendment says Congress shall make no law establishing Congress shall make no
[1:12:28.940 --> 1:12:31.580]  law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[1:12:31.580 --> 1:12:39.620]  thereof no law no jurisdiction just like a cop from Orange County can't go to
[1:12:39.620 --> 1:12:46.100]  skin activity New York and give people parking tickets no jurisdiction you
[1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:51.500]  don't have jurisdiction Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment
[1:12:51.500 --> 1:12:56.460]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof and then you get the
[1:12:56.460 --> 1:13:00.500]  faith-based initiative and they go in and secretly recruit them for FEMA to
[1:13:00.500 --> 1:13:03.860]  tell their flocks to submit and the World Council of Churches David Rockefeller
[1:13:03.860 --> 1:13:17.220]  financing the whole thing I mean that is so incredible so incredible and the 501
[1:13:17.220 --> 1:13:21.860]  C3 churches don't have to be part of that but they sign up for it and then
[1:13:21.860 --> 1:13:26.100]  now because of custom and practice they will civilly sue you the IRS will
[1:13:26.100 --> 1:13:31.300]  come after you and so it went from don't raise political money don't endorse a
[1:13:31.300 --> 1:13:34.300]  candidate which was a violation the first amendment of course the pastors
[1:13:34.300 --> 1:13:41.260]  can do whatever they want to now you don't talk about political issues a free
[1:13:41.260 --> 1:13:47.340]  speech of war you don't criticize the war you don't say you're against abortion
[1:13:47.340 --> 1:13:51.460]  you are not allowed to have a view and it's of the Lord to do whatever you're
[1:13:51.460 --> 1:13:56.700]  told and to submit and take the shots now if you don't know that's creepville
[1:13:56.700 --> 1:14:02.380]  right out of red dawn or right out of body snatchers to have the the preachers
[1:14:02.380 --> 1:14:05.740]  all recruited and people all over since I've been harping on this for three four
[1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:08.900]  years they go into their big church and talk to their preacher the preachers
[1:14:08.900 --> 1:14:14.780]  like hello miss Mary Beth come on in what can the Lord do are you gonna give the

[1:15:43.260 --> 1:15:48.020]  bringing down the U.S. and I've had enough of these bastards and let me tell
[1:15:48.020 --> 1:15:51.700]  you if somebody hadn't let you know I'm gonna tell you right now this is a real
[1:15:51.700 --> 1:15:57.820]  crisis ladies and gentlemen and they just ease it in always up in the game
[1:15:57.820 --> 1:16:00.900]  always expanding it
[1:16:04.340 --> 1:16:09.580]  you're naked in Tennessee finish up your point tell us about this demonic
[1:16:09.580 --> 1:16:13.060]  creature can even tell us the name of the church I don't care because I'll say
[1:16:13.060 --> 1:16:15.980]  it if your preacher's telling you go ahead and take the shot put it in Lord's
[1:16:15.980 --> 1:16:21.100]  hands don't have any thought processes don't be involved don't warn anybody I
[1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:26.460]  mean have you asked this this creature if he's on FEMA payroll or yeah well we
[1:16:26.460 --> 1:16:30.900]  know you know if it's a big chain church or big denomination we know they're on
[1:16:30.900 --> 1:16:34.940]  the payroll and then they just take orders I mean describe what this
[1:16:34.940 --> 1:16:43.340]  creature this this Judas go this traitor this demon says and does I guess he
[1:16:43.340 --> 1:16:49.700]  doesn't want me to tell the church the congregation God forbid okay because you
[1:16:49.700 --> 1:16:53.580]  don't have any free speech in America it's all secret police see now now you're
[1:16:53.580 --> 1:16:57.740]  like in a little secret police government run cult where you don't talk to
[1:16:57.740 --> 1:17:01.940]  outsiders about what they're okay let's not say the creature's name just tell
[1:17:01.940 --> 1:17:09.180]  us what he's doing it's just don't you know not really bring corruption to the
[1:17:09.180 --> 1:17:13.500]  church but it's like let's not let's leave that out because God will take care
[1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:18.980]  of it all yeah it's just don't want to go along
[1:17:18.980 --> 1:17:24.100]  so long people don't don't scare the people you know we can't live by fair
[1:17:24.100 --> 1:17:29.420]  and you know it's just I was wondering can how would I go about I guess because
[1:17:29.420 --> 1:17:32.900]  I didn't have any paper or anything to show the people like how would I ask him
[1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:37.500]  why God gave us spinal cords ask him why all the prophets were imprisoned or
[1:17:37.500 --> 1:17:43.100]  killed ask him why Jesus was crucified ask him why the whole Bible Old and New
[1:17:43.100 --> 1:17:47.220]  Testament is about being tested and standing against tyranny why were they
[1:17:47.220 --> 1:17:51.140]  put in the lion's den they should have just counted on God and said and followed
[1:17:51.140 --> 1:17:55.340]  their orders why were they put in the furnace why were people why was Paul
[1:17:55.340 --> 1:18:00.460]  put in prison why did they crucial I mean this is what did the whole Bibles
[1:18:00.460 --> 1:18:04.700]  about being a watchman protecting the little ones standing up for widows and
[1:18:04.700 --> 1:18:09.860]  orphans Jesus going in whipping the money changers I mean this guy is a devil I
[1:18:09.860 --> 1:18:14.020]  don't know what you do ma'am is you Google or search engine clergy response
[1:18:14.020 --> 1:18:20.180]  teams and you print off the YouTube page and in fact put it up on screen for me
[1:18:20.180 --> 1:18:22.580]  right now guys I want to give her the exact headline off that YouTube page
[1:18:22.580 --> 1:18:28.780]  bring that to him put clergy response teams info wars.com and print our
[1:18:28.780 --> 1:18:33.620]  articles about it and bring go to Kinko's bring in a hundred copies of that
[1:18:33.620 --> 1:18:37.860]  give it to the whole church and and if he wants to kick you out that's fine but
[1:18:37.860 --> 1:18:42.580]  you don't put up with that you're not in a cult and let me tell you that's what
[1:18:42.580 --> 1:18:45.380]  the government's turning all these churches into government worshiping
[1:18:45.380 --> 1:18:51.740]  devil cults my God they had this big cult leader pastor Hagee write a book he
[1:18:51.740 --> 1:18:56.060]  since withdrawn it saying Jesus wasn't the Messiah now even if you're not a
[1:18:56.060 --> 1:18:59.020]  Christian the issue is everybody knows in the Christian faith he's the Messiah
[1:18:59.020 --> 1:19:04.820]  he called him a basically an evil rebel I mean that's how warped these churches
[1:19:04.820 --> 1:19:08.740]  are ma'am and if he's your preacher starts telling you Jesus isn't Jesus
[1:19:08.740 --> 1:19:15.660]  he's bad news you know he says that God doesn't like this will bear like if you
[1:19:15.660 --> 1:19:21.500]  pay taxes you're not supposed to he's the word you're not supposed to fight
[1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:25.900]  against your because God doesn't like disobeys so the Founding Fathers were
[1:19:25.900 --> 1:19:30.020]  bad and fighting Hitler was bad so basically we should be born as jelly
[1:19:30.020 --> 1:19:34.980]  fish and just float around in the sea of corruption and never question
[1:19:34.980 --> 1:19:39.380]  government in any way and the Founding Fathers were basically evil look so he
[1:19:39.380 --> 1:19:42.940]  uses Romans 13 Hitler's favorite quote on you
[1:19:42.940 --> 1:19:47.340]  he hadn't used that yet because he wouldn't give me the chance to talk and explain myself
[1:19:47.340 --> 1:19:51.260]  you know he's just telling me everything's okay everything's okay just give me
[1:19:51.260 --> 1:19:57.420]  your money I mean is this about this church what is this no it's the Christian

[1:25:06.300 --> 1:25:10.300]  getting your money keep suppressing you they've been told by those that run the
[1:25:10.300 --> 1:25:14.260]  higher-level church you know just just just keep the slaves in line you can
[1:25:14.260 --> 1:25:19.060]  keep sucking their money and they're total pimps of the government so I mean
[1:25:19.060 --> 1:25:23.220]  is this a part of a larger chain of churches or is this a standalone pimp
[1:25:23.220 --> 1:25:30.220]  game it's a standalone church but what I'm really worried about is the people
[1:25:30.220 --> 1:25:33.580]  there because it's once the pastor says something it's like the news once the
[1:25:33.580 --> 1:25:37.620]  news says something everyone believes and it's just so hard to wait they don't
[1:25:37.620 --> 1:25:41.500]  know about false prophets get them get the passages about false prophets that
[1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:46.020]  won't warn the people and lead them to destruction look look I was going there
[1:25:46.020 --> 1:25:50.500]  with a bunch of pronounce and things and I would I would educate people and make
[1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:53.980]  him kick you out of the church but I mean that's a worthless church to be at
[1:25:53.980 --> 1:25:59.260]  how many people are there being being mined by this glitter bug well it's two
[1:25:59.260 --> 1:26:04.740]  services it's probably about maybe hundred fifty two hundred yeah well ma'am
[1:26:04.740 --> 1:26:11.300]  you can you can go to YouTube 60 minutes swine flu vaccine warning and you can
[1:26:11.300 --> 1:26:15.820]  show them 60 minutes about how the last time they did this it killed a bunch of
[1:26:15.820 --> 1:26:19.420]  people and of course that's the whole plan you can also print off Gardasil
[1:26:19.420 --> 1:26:24.620]  killing people and say no no ma'am I appreciate your call it's good to hear
[1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:29.220]  from you I'm out of control today it's just I can't handle it anymore David and
[1:26:29.220 --> 1:26:35.260]  Canada you're on the air go ahead how you doing Stephen Harper bad man I had a
[1:26:35.260 --> 1:26:38.460]  question it was a concern and I'd like to introduce us with our quote from
[1:26:38.460 --> 1:26:42.820]  Jordan Maxwell the elites are a lot of things but stupid is not one of them so
[1:26:42.820 --> 1:26:47.460]  my question being with the elites allowing information to leak in the
[1:26:47.460 --> 1:26:51.260]  mainstream media admitting that the Federal Reserve and the Baylorer scam
[1:26:51.260 --> 1:26:58.380]  and Ron Paul's bill getting momentum and in the house oh well if you audit the
[1:26:58.380 --> 1:27:03.100]  Fed it won't that crash the American economy and isn't that an ending so my
[1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:07.540]  question is what is the next step after auditing the Fed what do we do from there
[1:27:07.540 --> 1:27:10.380]  well it's a great question I'm gonna put you on hold and answer and then come
[1:27:10.380 --> 1:27:19.020]  back to it look justice be done may the heavens fall it the mother of all evil
[1:27:19.020 --> 1:27:26.060]  is this lesser of two evils or compromise idea and once you start saying
[1:27:26.060 --> 1:27:28.620]  well we better not audit it because we'll get something worse or we better
[1:27:28.620 --> 1:27:34.340]  not audit it because they'll crash the economy yeah and if a bully comes up and
[1:27:34.340 --> 1:27:38.020]  starts ordering you to give them their lunch money you might get your nose
[1:27:38.020 --> 1:27:41.980]  broken but it's better to just go ahead and get into it with a bully than live
[1:27:41.980 --> 1:27:48.620]  as a slave the truth is most bullies are cowards and you're gonna find out who
[1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:53.540]  you are by going through that stress and so absolutely they'll probably set a
[1:27:53.540 --> 1:27:56.980]  nuke off in a major city they might release a bio weapon but they're gonna
[1:27:56.980 --> 1:28:00.900]  do it down the road anyways we might as well put it on our timetable in our
[1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:09.420]  battlefield on our terms you got it and so we educate people how they stage
[1:28:09.420 --> 1:28:12.900]  terror attacks we educate people how they engage in financial terrorism we
[1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:16.340]  educate people how back in October they were getting thousand to one phone
[1:28:16.340 --> 1:28:19.020]  calls you heard Congressman Gohmert saying he was getting two thousand to one
[1:28:19.020 --> 1:28:23.820]  phone calls and then after they plunge the stock market 777 points by design
[1:28:23.820 --> 1:28:27.900]  with the plunge protection team not pumping it up and the president as
[1:28:27.900 --> 1:28:36.180]  minions bad-mouthing it then they were getting what he said about two calls for
[1:28:36.180 --> 1:28:43.860]  every couple hundred for it so I went from two thousand against you know less
[1:28:43.860 --> 1:28:48.060]  than one out of a hundred against but still that was the big swing my god we
[1:28:48.060 --> 1:28:52.380]  got maybe 1% for the government now all these greedy yuppies going I want my
[1:28:52.380 --> 1:28:56.140]  401k to go back up I guess give the bankers all the money then let them
[1:28:56.140 --> 1:28:59.900]  bankrupt everything it's financial terrorism they gave their lunch money
[1:28:59.900 --> 1:29:04.060]  to the bully and you know I got beat up by bullies a few times until I finally
[1:29:04.060 --> 1:29:07.940]  found out it's just it's good to go ahead and when they're sitting there
[1:29:07.940 --> 1:29:10.340]  putting their hands on your shoulders trying to scare you go ahead and head
[1:29:10.340 --> 1:29:17.260]  bottom and if they're three times you know your size or whatever when they
[1:29:17.260 --> 1:29:22.420]  get you down the ground just go ahead and bite into their leg you know and you
[1:29:22.420 --> 1:29:25.260]  could buy people really hard folks most people have inhibition you can just buy

[1:33:36.500 --> 1:33:44.340]  and if we just commit to bring down the globalist they can be beaten but
[1:33:44.340 --> 1:33:47.940]  regardless we have a job to do fighting evil and it's gonna be a lot worse on
[1:33:47.940 --> 1:33:51.420]  us rolling over these people and they don't respect us and they think we're a
[1:33:51.420 --> 1:33:58.540]  bunch of mesmerized pop controlled popular culture controlled idiots and
[1:33:58.540 --> 1:34:02.820]  they are euthanizing us they are carrying out eugenics against us I've
[1:34:02.820 --> 1:34:06.460]  got three different mainstream news articles today with mainstream news and
[1:34:06.460 --> 1:34:11.460]  government calling for not giving old people medical care and selling the
[1:34:11.460 --> 1:34:15.900]  public training the public about oh there's not gonna be enough flu shots
[1:34:15.900 --> 1:34:20.580]  for the old only the young will get it and that does a lot of things it it
[1:34:20.580 --> 1:34:24.340]  creates the illusion that the shot is something special that people are
[1:34:24.340 --> 1:34:30.420]  fighting over I call it the Christmas toy scenario and then also it's
[1:34:30.420 --> 1:34:34.580]  something that's good and then it also plays old off against young young off
[1:34:34.580 --> 1:34:43.740]  against old and it sets the precedent that the old don't get taken care of
[1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:47.540]  see somebody will read one of these articles and take it on face value oh
[1:34:47.540 --> 1:34:51.700]  look this article here in the Associated Press guaranteed written by
[1:34:51.700 --> 1:34:55.500]  propagandists as I read it the average person reads it no my gosh I better get
[1:34:55.500 --> 1:34:59.220]  out get one of those shots only certain people are getting it and they'll always
[1:34:59.220 --> 1:35:03.300]  put out fake newscast over shortages of flu shots this year then later I read
[1:35:03.300 --> 1:35:07.660]  how the companies couldn't sell one-tenth of it and nobody's taking it so
[1:35:07.660 --> 1:35:11.820]  they're having this fear mongering you know it came out back in the 80s and
[1:35:11.820 --> 1:35:19.580]  90s that they would make a children's movie just to sell the toy I saw a
[1:35:19.580 --> 1:35:23.620]  number back in the late 90s in Time Magazine when Star Wars was being
[1:35:23.620 --> 1:35:30.420]  re-released the first three and how George Lucas had made like six billion on
[1:35:30.420 --> 1:35:34.140]  toys and one billion on the movies I know it's got to be a lot more than that
[1:35:34.140 --> 1:35:40.060]  now but but the point is they'll have a Christmas toy and they'll have five or
[1:35:40.060 --> 1:35:46.900]  six seven big Hollywood production houses will make a movie just over a toy
[1:35:46.900 --> 1:35:51.140]  Schwarzenegger and jingle all the way admitted that they made a movie about the
[1:35:51.140 --> 1:35:58.900]  turbo doll the turbo man just for Christmas just to have that toy in
[1:35:58.900 --> 1:36:02.740]  stores and the whole movie is about running around looking for the toy and
[1:36:02.740 --> 1:36:06.940]  it worked it was one of the hit toys that year everybody ran out and did what
[1:36:06.940 --> 1:36:11.500]  they saw Schwarzenegger in October November December doing their kids had
[1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:17.220]  to have the turbo man doll they do the same thing with the vaccine let's see
[1:36:17.220 --> 1:36:20.540]  when I read an article just all the data like flicks up I understand the
[1:36:20.540 --> 1:36:24.540]  paradigms the programs the operations the tricks and you can tell the
[1:36:24.540 --> 1:36:27.860]  reporters just a mainline reporter or you can tell if it's an operative New
[1:36:27.860 --> 1:36:32.420]  York Times Wall Street Journal AP Reuters you're seeing operatives using
[1:36:32.420 --> 1:36:38.540]  psych warfare tricks you read some local newspaper guy it's not the same he'll
[1:36:38.540 --> 1:36:45.220]  just kind of regurgitate the mass mind control the understood propaganda
[1:36:46.300 --> 1:36:50.980]  they're just regurgitating what the higher-ups say who are operatives it's
[1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:54.900]  compartmentalization that they just become repeaters they're like a radio
[1:36:54.900 --> 1:37:00.340]  station repeater you know they can send a radio signal around the country with a
[1:37:00.340 --> 1:37:03.980]  few dozen linked up four or five watt transmitters because they bounce them
[1:37:03.980 --> 1:37:07.620]  from transmitter to transmitter they just repeat they just regurgitate like a
[1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:13.020]  parrot a parrot doesn't really talk it just repeats what it heard
[1:37:16.860 --> 1:37:22.380]  so the caller I'm about to go back to great questions while I'm taking your
[1:37:22.380 --> 1:37:26.020]  calls David you know I was asking well what do we do you know the elites are
[1:37:26.020 --> 1:37:29.620]  smart and you know why are they allowing this because they can't they've been
[1:37:29.620 --> 1:37:34.220]  ignoring for decades well while we've been out gee Edward Griffin and countless
[1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:44.620]  others for decades and and Bob Chapman and and just Bill Bob Benson and Bill
[1:37:44.620 --> 1:37:49.620]  Benson the law that ever was and red Beckman and countless others Anthony
[1:37:49.620 --> 1:37:59.780]  Hilder Eustace Mullins and the list goes on and on I know I'm forgetting a bunch
[1:37:59.780 --> 1:38:06.940]  of them warning people about the private Fed that took over 1913 and now the Fed
[1:38:06.940 --> 1:38:11.980]  is openly running everything stolen 23.7 trillion you bet there's gonna be a
[1:38:11.980 --> 1:38:15.740]  backlash against that and you're right they can try something like changing the
[1:38:15.740 --> 1:38:22.180]  name or you know quote reforming the Fed and making it more about the IMF and
[1:38:22.180 --> 1:38:26.620]  and that's been their plan is as the World Bank and and Federal Reserve get
[1:38:26.620 --> 1:38:31.220]  exposed moving into their left hand and that's even broken up in a right wing and
[1:38:31.220 --> 1:38:34.460]  left wing paradigm the World Bank and Federal Reserve are seen as more right
[1:38:34.460 --> 1:38:39.780]  wing more Anglo-American British US and then the IMF some more European Japanese
[1:38:39.780 --> 1:38:45.780]  it's all bull and the trilateral Commission was publicly set up to create
[1:38:45.780 --> 1:38:50.220]  this false dichotomy and they wrote publications bragging about it and they
[1:38:50.220 --> 1:38:54.340]  give you a fake left-wing version of the UN and a fake right-wing version and a
[1:38:54.340 --> 1:38:59.140]  fake right-wing split and left-wing split and NATO it's all about false choices
[1:38:59.140 --> 1:39:15.380]  it's the elites managing us so I mean what do you do just let the Federal
[1:39:15.380 --> 1:39:20.300]  Reserve no regardless they can't they can play a few more tricks they can juke
[1:39:20.300 --> 1:39:26.500]  they can jive they can jump back and forth and zig and zag they can do have
[1:39:26.500 --> 1:39:34.380]  the Senate block the investigation they can have the Senate block an audit
[1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:40.740]  Ron Paul said it here good it only makes it that much bigger in the media for
[1:39:40.740 --> 1:39:43.420]  months and months has tried to ignore this they weren't talking about this
[1:39:43.420 --> 1:39:46.820]  six months ago and we were having rallies and demonstrations and the Army was
[1:39:46.820 --> 1:39:51.180]  spying on us and DHS reports were being written saying we're terrorist they
[1:39:51.180 --> 1:39:56.300]  failed they went and told all the police we were terrorist and now it's on every
[1:39:56.300 --> 1:39:59.740]  nightly news channel and the biggest issue even though they try to divert us
[1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:09.660]  with you know the black professor cop story with Obama we're setting the
[1:40:09.660 --> 1:40:14.220]  agenda you know they try to set the agenda with cosmetic shows and shows
[1:40:14.220 --> 1:40:19.100]  about the rich and famous and first Madison Avenue tries to make you feel
[1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:24.060]  insecure and makes you try to feel bad about yourself so you socially never
[1:40:24.060 --> 1:40:26.820]  mature you're supposed to be insecure when they're 12 14 years old you're
[1:40:26.820 --> 1:40:29.780]  finding your identity you're supposed to go through trials and tribulations and
[1:40:29.780 --> 1:40:35.580]  become confident they want to forever freeze us in an insecure juvenile mode
[1:40:35.580 --> 1:40:39.100]  so that we're afraid of what people think about us and afraid of what people
[1:40:39.100 --> 1:40:44.380]  say so we'll just dress and talk how the TV says and pick a click one of the
[1:40:44.380 --> 1:40:49.100]  controlled niches or subgroups subcultures and just be part of that in
[1:40:49.100 --> 1:40:53.900]  all kind of nest in a group all trying to fit in because they made us in
[1:40:53.900 --> 1:41:02.740]  secure and the churches have been bought and paid for to twist the Bible to say
[1:41:02.740 --> 1:41:07.220]  it's the end of the world and lay down to government and go along with what
[1:41:07.220 --> 1:41:11.340]  you're told to do and then the secular people can't wake up to this whole
[1:41:11.340 --> 1:41:14.820]  mark of the beast system I mean even if you're not a Christian is it good to
[1:41:14.820 --> 1:41:17.420]  have the government tracking and tracing everything you buy, sell and do and
[1:41:17.420 --> 1:41:21.100]  controlling you and saying they're gonna control your behavior with carbon taxes
[1:41:21.100 --> 1:41:24.620]  with the tracking system I told you nine ten years ago they would do that with
[1:41:24.620 --> 1:41:27.820]  the carbon tax and with the casual society and now they've announced it
[1:41:27.820 --> 1:41:35.220]  because I was reading their policy reports this is really happening people
[1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:40.060]  always marvel that I know what's gonna happen most this stuff's public they've
[1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:48.700]  written hundreds of textbooks bragging about it I mean I got their playbook when
[1:41:48.700 --> 1:41:54.860]  we're fourth and down and past the 20 we're gonna go with this formation we're
[1:41:54.860 --> 1:41:58.220]  gonna go with this run we're gonna do this with a quarterback we're gonna do
[1:41:58.220 --> 1:42:03.540]  this with a running back I mean I've got their entire playbook it's as if I've
[1:42:03.540 --> 1:42:07.620]  been sitting in on all the coaches meetings for 20 years I know exactly
[1:42:07.620 --> 1:42:15.260]  what they're gonna do exactly what's going on it's like being in a car it's
[1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:20.660]  like being in a car with a maniac driving it and you know that they're
[1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:25.260]  going down a long road they're going 150 miles an hour and you're and you start
[1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:30.340]  telling hey right over this hill I've been this way a hundred times right over
[1:42:30.340 --> 1:42:35.340]  this hill it takes a quick left and it goes from a 60 to 70 mile an hour to a
[1:42:35.340 --> 1:42:40.260]  30 mile an hour turn we're going to fly off the road we're going to fly out the
[1:42:40.260 --> 1:42:47.020]  road and die there's a cliff it makes a turn into a canyon you've got to slow
[1:42:47.020 --> 1:42:50.460]  down and they're just laughing at you and laughing at you and you try to go up
[1:42:50.460 --> 1:42:53.820]  and warn them and they laugh at you but it doesn't matter you still got to warn
[1:42:53.820 --> 1:42:56.940]  them because you're still stuck in the car with these maniacs you're still
[1:42:56.940 --> 1:43:01.980]  stuck in the car with a bunch of narcissistic stupid weak cowardly people
[1:43:01.980 --> 1:43:08.620]  who have been mesmerized scientifically turned into arrested development
[1:43:08.620 --> 1:43:14.980]  gibbering cowards and let me tell you as stuff gets worse a lot of people are
[1:43:14.980 --> 1:43:19.140]  going to wake up but and when it really gets bad a lot of them are going to turn
[1:43:19.140 --> 1:43:25.580]  on us and decide through cowardice and through the Stockholm syndrome print
[1:43:25.580 --> 1:43:29.180]  Stockholm syndrome for me I want the exact definition you know that's where
[1:43:29.180 --> 1:43:34.460]  you turn to your kidnappers and love them turn to your torture and love them
[1:43:34.460 --> 1:43:38.980]  and your mind does double think your mind does crime stop in Orwellian you
[1:43:38.980 --> 1:43:42.500]  really decide to like the guy that said you locked up in a barn for six months
[1:43:42.500 --> 1:43:48.140]  raping you and pulling your toenails out you start worshiping them that's what
[1:43:48.140 --> 1:43:53.260]  the average weak person does even the strongest people start doing that well
[1:43:53.260 --> 1:44:00.380]  not me I know what you are scum I know what you are New World Order sadist and
[1:44:00.380 --> 1:44:03.900]  I know you're jacking with the air and water and bragging about it you little
[1:44:03.900 --> 1:44:10.500]  power tripping bastards I got some raw video sent to me at Holdren you know
[1:44:10.500 --> 1:44:13.860]  White House press briefing shot by some news people and it's just the side
[1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:17.820]  discussions and the way they look on his face that son of a bitch is on a
[1:44:17.820 --> 1:44:22.500]  power trip from hell and let me tell you something he's dangerous ladies and
[1:44:22.500 --> 1:44:26.900]  gentlemen and I'm not risking my life to take this murderer on for nothing I want
[1:44:26.900 --> 1:44:31.220]  to take action against these people and you bet they're murderers first thing
[1:44:31.220 --> 1:44:35.460]  they did was release the funding and then double it for abortions and force and
[1:44:35.460 --> 1:44:41.780]  fantasize all over the world mainstream news Stockholm syndrome is a
[1:44:41.780 --> 1:44:45.700]  psychological response sometimes seen in abductee and hostages in which the
[1:44:45.700 --> 1:44:50.620]  hostage showed signs of loyalty to the hostage taker regardless of the danger or
[1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:54.780]  risk in which they have been placed see and they do that because they it's make
[1:44:54.780 --> 1:44:58.020]  believe and they've done studies they found the Stockholm syndrome is getting
[1:44:58.020 --> 1:45:01.300]  more and more common people a hundred years ago didn't behave like this on average
[1:45:01.300 --> 1:45:05.980]  but they're delusional it's a TV make believe world they think that if they
[1:45:05.980 --> 1:45:10.500]  decide to like the person pulling their toenails out that it makes it okay and
[1:45:10.500 --> 1:45:16.700]  they even start liking it just exactly what one of the top globalist Aldous
[1:45:16.700 --> 1:45:23.540]  Huxley said he said people can be made to love their servitude the syndrome is
[1:45:23.540 --> 1:45:34.420]  named after the normal Strahberg robbery in Stockholm Sweden in which the bank
[1:45:34.420 --> 1:45:39.580]  robbers held bank employees hostage august 23rd to 2873 in the case the
[1:45:39.580 --> 1:45:44.100]  victims became emotionally attached to their victimizers and even defended
[1:45:44.100 --> 1:45:47.780]  their captors after they were freed from the six-day ordeal the term Stockholm
[1:45:47.780 --> 1:45:52.020]  syndrome was coined by the criminologist and psychiatrist Niles
[1:45:52.020 --> 1:45:56.020]  burgote and I agree it's a real syndrome who have assisted the police during a
[1:45:56.020 --> 1:46:00.020]  robbery and referred to the syndrome in a news broadcast yeah now what that is is
[1:46:00.020 --> 1:46:05.020]  you take warlike intelligent dynamic Swedes and you domesticate them in a
[1:46:05.020 --> 1:46:10.300]  socialist system and you make serving the oppressors and the boss your
[1:46:10.300 --> 1:46:15.620]  religion your cultural identity and then it turns in on itself and look we serve
[1:46:15.620 --> 1:46:18.540]  the corrupt police the corrupt government you got New Jersey with all
[1:46:18.540 --> 1:46:24.260]  these mayors and hundreds of officials now in body organ snatching and selling
[1:46:24.260 --> 1:46:28.900]  out of China and other places and stealing money and charities that's how
[1:46:28.900 --> 1:46:34.260]  the whole government works every major town every major city they run child
[1:46:34.260 --> 1:46:42.460]  kidnapping and the government is pure evil pure evil we passed the tipping
[1:46:42.460 --> 1:46:46.460]  point probably five six years ago because the first evil creeps in hides
[1:46:46.460 --> 1:46:54.780]  recruits more of its people in that's why in corporations I've been reading
[1:46:54.780 --> 1:46:58.180]  corporate handbooks things trying to figure out how to protect my operation
[1:46:58.180 --> 1:47:01.980]  they say don't hire people who have friends then hire their friends and hire
[1:47:01.980 --> 1:47:06.780]  groups that's how people can infiltrate that's how in Europe it's only masons
[1:47:06.780 --> 1:47:10.580]  that are hired now as judges and barristers they won't let you in see
[1:47:10.580 --> 1:47:15.780]  that's how any good old boy system works and folks they have done nothing but
[1:47:15.780 --> 1:47:22.260]  brought their people in now and they run the show and they're gonna take your
[1:47:22.260 --> 1:47:25.300]  kids and they're gonna do medical experiments on them and they're gonna
[1:47:25.300 --> 1:47:30.220]  take your kids and they're gonna rape them because they like to and they're
[1:47:30.220 --> 1:47:34.620]  gonna take your organs and they're gonna put crap in your water cuz they like
[1:47:34.620 --> 1:47:38.260]  it cuz they're psychopaths folks they enjoy it you want to go out and go
[1:47:38.260 --> 1:47:42.140]  bass fishing you want to go out and start a fire and make a bowl of chili and
[1:47:42.140 --> 1:47:45.420]  hang out with your buddies and eat some crackers or go out and you know clean
[1:47:45.420 --> 1:47:51.820]  your gun and shoot it or you want to go bowling well you're a normal person so
[1:47:51.820 --> 1:47:55.740]  you're a good person and but you have a weak spot you have a blind spot you
[1:47:55.740 --> 1:47:58.740]  don't know how to recognize evil when it's right in your face and so these
[1:47:58.740 --> 1:48:02.460]  bastards have gotten in control and they've taken over the entire society
[1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:08.340]  we're now a tyranny and I'll tell you why I'm still alive because they don't
[1:48:08.340 --> 1:48:11.100]  want to underline they don't want to highlight everything I've said and done
[1:48:11.100 --> 1:48:15.260]  because I'm so on target it scares them and to me I'm like a monster in the
[1:48:15.260 --> 1:48:19.460]  forest of them to the monsters I'm a monster you understand that from their
[1:48:19.460 --> 1:48:25.340]  perspective I'm like some giant roving bear and they just want to stay out of
[1:48:25.340 --> 1:48:34.820]  my way because they actually respect strength and courage they detest you
[1:48:34.820 --> 1:48:40.460]  that grovel and smile at them and think it's cute stop being cowardly

[1:57:17.460 --> 1:57:20.780]  well I understand we have to do everything we can and yeah we're in a
[1:57:20.780 --> 1:57:24.500]  street fight we have to fight and do what we need to do but I was wondering if
[1:57:24.500 --> 1:57:29.180]  far we're gonna have the institutions prepared to install once we audit the
[1:57:29.180 --> 1:57:33.260]  fact and we did destroy it yeah we can have what we had before the US
[1:57:33.260 --> 1:57:36.900]  government will issue the currency and the bankers are gonna pull every scam
[1:57:36.900 --> 1:57:40.220]  in the book just like they did with financial terrorism in October we were
[1:57:40.220 --> 1:57:44.820]  educating folks about that too what you do is you educate them that you know
[1:57:44.820 --> 1:57:47.620]  these bankers it robs you well this is what they're gonna do when we do this
[1:57:47.620 --> 1:57:52.580]  and you defang them they'll still throw a fit these guys will probably do
[1:57:52.580 --> 1:57:58.780]  anything to keep power but you can't get into them if the money is all based on
[1:57:58.780 --> 1:58:02.340]  nothing and fake anyways watch we even came back after we audit the fed like
[1:58:02.340 --> 1:58:06.700]  would we still would be will we be no no no no I mean the stuff like the
[1:58:06.700 --> 1:58:10.340]  derivatives and all this crud you just wipe them off you freeze them that's
[1:58:10.340 --> 1:58:13.260]  people got involved in all those speculative deals it's mainly big corrupt
[1:58:13.260 --> 1:58:17.940]  institutions and you let them collapse listen they lied to you and said we'll
[1:58:17.940 --> 1:58:22.460]  give you the money to fix your mortgage if you're behind we'll unclog it they
[1:58:22.460 --> 1:58:27.240]  gave no money to it it's the effect it came out mainstream news and in
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:31.780]  Congress fact I have that clip one plate later that the Fed is paying banks not
[1:58:31.780 --> 1:58:36.540]  alone I told people that day one it would pay for all the mortgages in the
[1:58:36.540 --> 1:58:50.940]  country more than twice what they stole and they're just getting started the

[2:00:15.740 --> 2:00:23.460]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones look we've
[2:00:23.460 --> 2:00:28.540]  had a lot of great calls dealing with the flu and medical workers being told
[2:00:28.540 --> 2:00:33.020]  they're being told they've got to take it there's no law that's made up I got a
[2:00:33.020 --> 2:00:36.540]  guest coming up about 30 minutes and I'm gonna continue with your calls but I
[2:00:36.540 --> 2:00:40.820]  want to cycle through the calls and get people to call in who see in le09
[2:00:40.820 --> 2:00:45.020]  martial law takeover drill going on that's not me saying that FEMA says
[2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:50.820]  that this is foreign troops with us troops in FEMA and local police in a
[2:00:50.820 --> 2:00:54.260]  federalization drill which practices federalizing everything and then
[2:00:54.260 --> 2:00:58.220]  bringing the federal government under international control and everything's
[2:00:58.220 --> 2:01:01.620]  been building towards martial law for a long time this is probably just one
[2:01:01.620 --> 2:01:05.100]  more drill but we have to pay attention to each event we can't become
[2:01:05.100 --> 2:01:08.420]  conditioned to this but let's take a few calls right now before this
[2:01:08.420 --> 2:01:13.460]  investigative journalist joins us about weird secret societies in DC right now
[2:01:13.460 --> 2:01:21.340]  let's go to who's up next here Joel in Ohio you're on the air Joel
[2:01:21.340 --> 2:01:28.820]  hi Alex hey buddy yeah I have a question about the flu vaccination now
[2:01:28.820 --> 2:01:33.460]  understand that there's no real laws about the vaccinations and that's
[2:01:33.460 --> 2:01:38.820]  policies and yeah there's never been a law there's an executive order signed by
[2:01:38.820 --> 2:01:43.020]  Bush and then reauthorized by Obama but when they run around saying oh you got
[2:01:43.020 --> 2:01:46.620]  to take the shot currently they haven't implemented that notice you don't hear
[2:01:46.620 --> 2:01:50.220]  the White House saying it they're just at the ground level so nobody gets spooked
[2:01:50.220 --> 2:01:55.580]  saying you got to take the shot go ahead what will the legal disposition of
[2:01:55.580 --> 2:02:01.060]  that be if they make it mandatory will that be an executive order or a real law
[2:02:01.060 --> 2:02:05.820]  or how will that work do we know
[2:02:06.580 --> 2:02:11.020]  yes look they're not gonna be able to get everybody vaccinated this time they
[2:02:11.020 --> 2:02:15.220]  try each time to set up the federal bureaucracy not just here but worldwide
[2:02:15.220 --> 2:02:20.860]  to force everybody on to this to set the precedent kind of is just a background
[2:02:20.860 --> 2:02:27.380]  idea that it's the law that you've got to take shots and so they force police
[2:02:27.380 --> 2:02:32.340]  medical workers firemen and most say no most departments wake up and say no some
[2:02:32.340 --> 2:02:36.420]  departments are have particularly cowardly dumb people in them and weak-minded
[2:02:36.420 --> 2:02:40.340]  police chiefs and they accept or weak-minded hospital heads the last
[2:02:40.340 --> 2:02:43.660]  straw was when Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take the shot he was saying it's
[2:02:43.660 --> 2:02:47.300]  the law you got to take it and people said what law and I had fire chiefs and
[2:02:47.300 --> 2:02:53.780]  police chiefs on and hospital heads saying no in fact not just no hell no so
[2:02:53.780 --> 2:02:58.860]  but but they'll just keep coming back coming back just like we won't let them
[2:02:58.860 --> 2:03:02.740]  pass carbon taxes the last five times they're back again and this time pass it
[2:03:02.740 --> 2:03:08.020]  to the house they won't you know they tried dozens of times more than for more
[2:03:08.020 --> 2:03:12.020]  than 30 years to pass hate crimes laws restrict free speech they finally pass it
[2:03:12.020 --> 2:03:15.580]  out of the house it's now past the Senate it's going into conference you know
[2:03:15.580 --> 2:03:19.660]  they just keep coming back because they've got the fighting spirit because
[2:03:19.660 --> 2:03:24.340]  they know the fight belongs to who wants it most and we just got to get into the
[2:03:24.340 --> 2:03:30.540]  fight and say it's fun to fight these people but see once they get you to be
[2:03:30.540 --> 2:03:34.140]  self-centered and selfish you don't care about anybody including yourself and
[2:03:34.140 --> 2:03:38.380]  once people have that attitude it's an atmosphere where corruption and evil run
[2:03:38.380 --> 2:03:45.420]  wild you know you are making a difference in my life Alex I work at a

[2:08:03.340 --> 2:08:07.780]  secretive ministry and living quarters for several members of Congress at which
[2:08:07.780 --> 2:08:12.260]  Governor Sanford and Senator John Ensign of Nevada both received some sort of
[2:08:12.260 --> 2:08:16.620]  counseling during their extramarital affairs a number of other C Street
[2:08:16.620 --> 2:08:21.100]  affiliates are now going on the record about the shadowy organization mainly to
[2:08:21.100 --> 2:08:25.700]  defend its secrecy Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma telling roll call
[2:08:25.700 --> 2:08:30.740]  newspaper quote it's a great place and vowing to continue holding foreign
[2:08:30.740 --> 2:08:35.420]  policy meetings with African ambassadors at the C Street house former Ohio
[2:08:35.420 --> 2:08:40.420]  Congressman Tony Hall tells politico.com the prayer breakfasts he attended at C
[2:08:40.420 --> 2:08:44.260]  Street were quote probably some of the best moments I had during the week
[2:08:44.260 --> 2:08:50.660]  precisely because we closed the doors C Street is also in the news anew because
[2:08:50.660 --> 2:08:54.420]  of something that happened on the house floor last week a member of Congress
[2:08:54.420 --> 2:08:58.860]  one with ties to C Street argued against public funding for abortion services
[2:08:58.860 --> 2:09:03.900]  by saying that if there were public funding for abortion Barack Obama might
[2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:11.420]  have been aborted as a fetus also Clarence Thomas if you think of it in
[2:09:11.420 --> 2:09:16.980]  human terms there is a financial incentive that will be put in place
[2:09:16.980 --> 2:09:21.940]  paid for by tax dollars they will encourage women who are in our single
[2:09:21.940 --> 2:09:27.580]  parents living below the poverty level to have the opportunity for a free
[2:09:27.580 --> 2:09:32.540]  abortion if you take that scenario and apply it to many of the great minds we
[2:09:32.540 --> 2:09:38.540]  have today who would we have been deprived of our president grew up in
[2:09:38.540 --> 2:09:43.460]  those similar circumstances if that financial incentive was in place is it

[2:11:06.460 --> 2:11:10.540]  editor to Harper's and Rolling Stone has been writing about the intersection of
[2:11:10.540 --> 2:11:15.820]  religion politics and culture for more than a decade his writing on religion

[2:11:48.100 --> 2:11:54.900]  Rachel Maddow kind of breaking down what you were going over first tell us
[2:11:54.900 --> 2:12:01.860]  about yourself how you got interested in this about this group on K Street this
[2:12:01.860 --> 2:12:07.500]  the family and then how it ties into Ashcroft's group the brotherhood it's
[2:12:07.500 --> 2:12:11.220]  also out of another house or the same house it all gets confusing there's
[2:12:11.220 --> 2:12:16.940]  other secretive right wing Christian groups like the council on national
[2:12:16.940 --> 2:12:20.900]  policy there's a lot of different organizations and I haven't studied them
[2:12:20.900 --> 2:12:24.820]  all but I've tried to look at some of them tell us tell us about how you woke
[2:12:24.820 --> 2:12:35.060]  up to this group there you go yes we think of K Street as the kind of the
[2:12:35.060 --> 2:12:38.740]  avenue of influence in Washington I think we've got a lobbyist out of
[2:12:38.740 --> 2:12:43.340]  Freudian slips sorry go ahead exactly what they're acting like you know it
[2:12:43.340 --> 2:12:48.900]  began I was a couple years ago working on my first book I was traveling around
[2:12:48.900 --> 2:12:52.540]  the country and spending time with unusual religious communities and a
[2:12:52.540 --> 2:12:57.500]  friend of mine worried that her brother had joined a cult said would you meet
[2:12:57.500 --> 2:13:03.100]  with him this is way back in 2011 and so this guy came up I've known for 12
[2:13:03.100 --> 2:13:07.780]  years and frankly you'd always been kind of a jerk but he had really turned his
[2:13:07.780 --> 2:13:12.580]  life around despite the fact that his career left his relationship to move
[2:13:12.580 --> 2:13:16.700]  to Washington and be of service to powerful people and he said look you
[2:13:16.700 --> 2:13:19.900]  won't understand it unless you see it and you can't get in unless you're
[2:13:19.900 --> 2:13:23.260]  invited and I said well how do I apply and he said there are no applications
[2:13:23.260 --> 2:13:29.860]  there's just a family so I have an interesting to me not as a believer but
[2:13:29.860 --> 2:13:33.380]  just as a person who is interested about the the varieties of religious
[2:13:33.380 --> 2:13:37.780]  experience my face but I went down and spent about a month living with these
[2:13:37.780 --> 2:13:41.340]  guys and I didn't know it was political at first but then that we had a visit
[2:13:41.340 --> 2:13:45.340]  from Senator Jesse Helms okay all right I think I understand wait a minute I
[2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:48.500]  mean this doesn't sound and I'm not defending the group because I don't
[2:13:48.500 --> 2:13:53.100]  even know enough about it to to even get his name right but C Street the family
[2:13:53.100 --> 2:13:58.780]  C Street's the name and obviously the house if it's such a cult and I do agree
[2:13:58.780 --> 2:14:04.740]  it looks pretty culty why did they just let you right in then you know I well
[2:14:04.740 --> 2:14:07.380]  first of all I actually say that they are not a cult I don't think they are
[2:14:07.380 --> 2:14:10.700]  cultish but not a cult you know because the cult has certain characteristics
[2:14:10.700 --> 2:14:14.540]  they are cultish they've got the cult of personality around their leader Doug Coe
[2:14:14.540 --> 2:14:19.580]  but what they really believe they really believe in the sort of network of elite
[2:14:19.580 --> 2:14:23.260]  and so because I was invited that's the only way you get in you get invited so
[2:14:23.260 --> 2:14:28.340]  because I was invited by this guy that made me sort of okay and I think they
[2:14:28.340 --> 2:14:32.100]  were actually interested in the fact that I'm a journalist the writer because
[2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:37.540]  they saw me as an influencer someone who can help spread the message so they had
[2:14:37.540 --> 2:14:40.780]  me into this house I originally wrote about this for Harper's magazine if
[2:14:40.780 --> 2:14:43.620]  anyone sitting out there being skeptical that all went through fact-checking
[2:14:43.620 --> 2:14:47.740]  legal review never been disputed live with these guys for a month okay but I
[2:14:47.740 --> 2:14:50.580]  mean they're pretty confident then about the way they operate and the way they
[2:14:50.580 --> 2:14:55.500]  work to let a prominent journalist into their midst though I wouldn't say I was
[2:14:55.500 --> 2:15:00.420]  prominent at that point you know they've been around for 70 years they do believe
[2:15:00.420 --> 2:15:04.020]  in secrecy the leader of the group Doug Coe says the more invisible you can make
[2:15:04.020 --> 2:15:08.940]  your organization the more influence it will have okay so you did infiltrate to
[2:15:08.940 --> 2:15:14.940]  a certain level so this is cultish then you know what's absolutely cultish I
[2:15:14.940 --> 2:15:19.420]  mean you know there's a cult of personality around this guy Doug Coe who
[2:15:19.420 --> 2:15:23.180]  may sometimes call first brother they say he is a special relationship with God
[2:15:23.180 --> 2:15:29.100]  unparalleled by anyone else in the world and that also that the inner circle
[2:15:29.100 --> 2:15:31.500]  members and here's where it gets really creepy when we're talking about
[2:15:31.500 --> 2:15:35.340]  senator and then governor Stanford guy's link to the group the inner circle
[2:15:35.340 --> 2:15:39.140]  members are not bound by the same morality that applies to the rest of us
[2:15:39.140 --> 2:15:44.020]  the morality is a human construct and that God has a different different story
[2:15:44.020 --> 2:15:48.220]  ready for these powerful men now is this the same group that Ashcroft's part of
[2:15:48.220 --> 2:15:50.980]  it because I saw articles like four or five years ago about and did some
[2:15:50.980 --> 2:15:56.180]  research about Ashcroft part of a house he lived in and other people that were
[2:15:56.180 --> 2:15:59.940]  members I mean is this the only group like this are you aware of others
[2:15:59.940 --> 2:16:12.220]  I know you're thinking of Ashcroft I spent a you may even have been looking at I mean I've been writing about this for a while John Ashcroft I lived with him for a month and then discovered they had dumped 600 boxes of documents unorganized they hadn't even
[2:16:12.220 --> 2:16:16.140]  sistered through them and Billy Graham's archive so that was your article I did read
[2:16:16.140 --> 2:16:20.220]  about how they don't really care about abortion and they like Machiavelli wasn't
[2:16:20.220 --> 2:16:24.180]  it I mean I'm going from memory here but not as much social issues John Ashcroft that
[2:16:24.180 --> 2:16:28.340]  found letters dating back to the early 1980s John Ashcroft was writing to the
[2:16:28.340 --> 2:16:31.900]  leader of the group Doug Coe first brother saying that he wanted to get
[2:16:31.900 --> 2:16:35.860]  involved and could he be helped and that's what the family has done is
[2:16:35.860 --> 2:16:39.660]  or could they've identified guys that they think they can work with and then
[2:16:39.660 --> 2:16:44.500]  they groomed them and sort of raise them up the political ladder Doug Coe the
[2:16:44.500 --> 2:16:48.220]  leader of the group he likes to say we work with power where we can build new
[2:16:48.220 --> 2:16:52.060]  power where we can't and that means that they've got a lot of political allies
[2:16:52.060 --> 2:16:55.740]  in Washington a political religious fraternity
[2:16:55.740 --> 2:17:00.940]  very much so very much though okay well I mean I know I'm throwing a lot of
[2:17:00.940 --> 2:17:03.500]  points in here because I've over the years I've done research here there but
[2:17:03.500 --> 2:17:08.660]  you forget a lot more than you you know then you can actually comprehend but I
[2:17:08.660 --> 2:17:12.820]  know there's all these weird secretive groups did you ever run into any
[2:17:12.820 --> 2:17:18.860]  connections in this group with masons masonic groups or with opus day
[2:17:18.860 --> 2:17:26.180]  Catholic groups or with the CNP Council on National Policy there's a lot of
[2:17:26.180 --> 2:17:32.340]  overlap with the CNP guys like Ed Meese and various members like that but one of
[2:17:32.340 --> 2:17:35.540]  the most interesting connections I did find was with opus day and you might
[2:17:35.540 --> 2:17:40.500]  almost describe the family as kind of a Protestant opus day but they lack even
[2:17:40.500 --> 2:17:46.580]  the integrity of opus day but they originally they were very interested
[2:17:46.580 --> 2:17:50.980]  working in Spain the international work around the world the dictator for a
[2:17:50.980 --> 2:17:54.700]  long time they were named Franco and he was not interested in having Protestant
[2:17:54.700 --> 2:17:59.500]  groups around until they made contact with the government opus day
[2:17:59.500 --> 2:18:04.420]  members and then started building up a network of alliances from our research
[2:18:04.420 --> 2:18:08.500]  I got to spend a lot of time with Senator Sam round back of Kansas who has a
[2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:12.380]  unique distinction of being a member of the family and an associate of opus day
[2:18:12.380 --> 2:18:18.060]  he converted to a very strange kind of Catholicism to opus day chapel which
[2:18:18.060 --> 2:18:23.020]  appropriately not actually is on pastry in Washington okay see those are the
[2:18:23.020 --> 2:18:25.700]  questions I haven't seen asked on television I've read your articles over
[2:18:25.700 --> 2:18:29.220]  the years and haven't read your book yet though we just got it and so I've got a
[2:18:29.220 --> 2:18:33.380]  piece here a piece there and I'm trying to delve more into the architecture of
[2:18:33.380 --> 2:18:37.900]  left-wing and right-wing groups did you ever run into any connections to
[2:18:37.900 --> 2:18:42.420]  Bohemian Grove because a lot of quote Christian conservatives that have these
[2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:46.500]  big public personas as Christian conservatives also go to the Grove that
[2:18:46.500 --> 2:18:52.860]  Richard Nixon described as a homosexual orgy I don't know about that part but
[2:18:52.860 --> 2:18:57.260]  at Doug Coe certainly is a long time Doug Coe the leader of the group is a
[2:18:57.260 --> 2:19:01.580]  long-time attendee and you know certainly we're talking about here you
[2:19:01.580 --> 2:19:06.780]  know guys like Ed Meese and their former Attorney General Ashcroft and we're
[2:19:06.780 --> 2:19:10.380]  talking about the power elite and so they do go to Bohemian Grove there is a
[2:19:10.380 --> 2:19:15.460]  Vatican connection there is a Bohemian Grove connection it's just always the
[2:19:15.460 --> 2:19:19.500]  same well I'm you know I'm actually where you make it call that a Vatican
[2:19:19.500 --> 2:19:23.380]  connection I would call that an opus day connection I think that's a day is a
[2:19:23.380 --> 2:19:27.780]  little bit distinct I mean you know look mainstream American Catholicism there is
[2:19:27.780 --> 2:19:31.500]  I have no issue with that what I'm not here bashing any groups either I mean
[2:19:31.500 --> 2:19:34.900]  this is a secular radio show I'm trying to see how all these groups tie
[2:19:34.900 --> 2:19:38.780]  together yeah yeah and I think I think you draw some connections are important
[2:19:38.780 --> 2:19:42.220]  to make wow well listen I'm gonna try to let you roll me get back I just wanted
[2:19:42.220 --> 2:19:46.940]  to ask some questions that I haven't heard asked of you before and it's

[2:22:03.260 --> 2:22:07.220]  Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[2:22:07.220 --> 2:22:10.940]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[2:22:10.940 --> 2:22:13.900]  place limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[2:22:13.900 --> 2:22:17.660]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[2:22:17.660 --> 2:22:21.020]  depositors held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will
[2:22:21.020 --> 2:22:24.540]  skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[2:22:24.540 --> 2:22:28.220]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[2:22:28.220 --> 2:22:32.140]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[2:22:32.140 --> 2:22:35.980]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[2:22:35.980 --> 2:22:40.140]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I
[2:22:40.140 --> 2:22:44.620]  recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned

[2:24:18.780 --> 2:24:23.780]  a half we're gonna have some huge guests on it's gonna leave it that and know
[2:24:23.780 --> 2:24:27.020]  those huge guests are not the big astronauts we got coming on the next
[2:24:27.020 --> 2:24:32.380]  two weeks and I'm just gonna leave it at that little little Easter egg as they
[2:24:32.380 --> 2:24:38.300]  say like on a DVD little hidden goodie that is coming up later going back to
[2:24:38.300 --> 2:24:42.940]  the author of the family Jeff Charlotte and this is just a bottomless pit of
[2:24:42.940 --> 2:24:48.740]  weirdness but he's a great journalist writes for harpers and for the new york
[2:24:48.740 --> 2:24:53.780]  times as well I saw an article in your times he writes for harpers and a
[2:24:53.780 --> 2:24:57.820]  rolling stone the reason I was bringing up harpers it was actually harpers had
[2:24:57.820 --> 2:25:01.380]  the interview with Nixon when he was talking about the bohemian grove and
[2:25:01.380 --> 2:25:05.700]  that was where my quote from that came okay you got the floor this is a short
[2:25:05.700 --> 2:25:11.700]  segment long segment coming up start at the beginning you you you get to get
[2:25:11.700 --> 2:25:15.620]  inside there you've written articles about how it's not really Christian though
[2:25:15.620 --> 2:25:20.500]  from not wanting to stop abortion and saying we like Machiavelli I'm going
[2:25:20.500 --> 2:25:24.300]  from memory here but a lot of weird stuff what is it really some type of
[2:25:24.300 --> 2:25:28.580]  strange intelligence front because just in a snapshot that's what it looks like
[2:25:28.580 --> 2:25:34.740]  to me you know it goes back it begins in 1935 they organize Abraham Brady
[2:25:34.740 --> 2:25:38.900]  believes that he has a vision that God comes to him and speaks to him tells him
[2:25:38.900 --> 2:25:43.020]  that Christianity has been getting it wrong for 2,000 years and any focus on
[2:25:43.020 --> 2:25:46.980]  the poor the weak the suffering the down-and-out that's not right well God
[2:25:46.980 --> 2:25:52.060]  wants him to be is a missionary to and for the powerful the up-and-out he calls
[2:25:52.060 --> 2:25:57.940]  them he begins organizing guys like Henry Ford and a group of congressmen he
[2:25:57.940 --> 2:26:01.020]  gets some businessmen together he starts out in the state of Washington they
[2:26:01.020 --> 2:26:06.100]  managed to elect a governor and on that basis they start going overseas they're
[2:26:06.100 --> 2:26:10.180]  involved with the white washing of Nazis after World War two and then they
[2:26:10.180 --> 2:26:15.820]  start excuse me excuse me something about Nazis yeah yeah I'm afraid so it's
[2:26:15.820 --> 2:26:19.940]  always suspicious when someone talks about that stuff but it's not even I mean
[2:26:19.940 --> 2:26:27.060]  you mentioned Henry Ford you know not only that God wanted him to serve a
[2:26:27.060 --> 2:26:31.140]  powerful instead of the power left but they began with this idea they were
[2:26:31.140 --> 2:26:34.420]  looking around the world in 1930s they thought democracy was done they said
[2:26:34.420 --> 2:26:38.820]  democracy cannot compete with fascism and communism well communism was
[2:26:38.820 --> 2:26:42.860]  definitely not for them these are very wealthy businessmen and fascism
[2:26:42.860 --> 2:26:45.940]  fascism looks pretty good but they didn't like it where they didn't like
[2:26:45.940 --> 2:26:49.380]  Mussolini so they said what we're gonna do with such a totalitarianism for
[2:26:49.380 --> 2:26:52.780]  Christ which is sort of missing the point of the Christian message but that
[2:26:52.780 --> 2:26:56.980]  was their approach and they started recruiting a lot of American fascist
[2:26:56.980 --> 2:27:03.140]  empathizes and over the years have when they go and make alliances with foreign
[2:27:03.140 --> 2:27:06.620]  dictators they look for guys who exemplify that mode that's how the leader
[2:27:06.620 --> 2:27:09.900]  of the group has said he likes to take Congress and he says who were the three
[2:27:09.900 --> 2:27:13.220]  men in the 20th century who best understood the message of the New
[2:27:13.220 --> 2:27:17.900]  Testament and maybe you say something like Dietrich Bonhoeffer or Martin
[2:27:17.900 --> 2:27:20.060]  Luther King or maybe you're more conservative than you said Billy Graham
[2:27:20.060 --> 2:27:25.060]  he says no no no he says Hitler Stalin and now and he says what they understood
[2:27:25.060 --> 2:27:28.820]  is it the New Testament and this is their reading is not about love or
[2:27:28.820 --> 2:27:33.540]  mercy or injustice or forgiveness it's about power and those guys understood
[2:27:33.540 --> 2:27:37.620]  power so you want to accept you want to model yourself on power another sermon
[2:27:37.620 --> 2:27:41.740]  you can find actually online on the website of the navigators Christian
[2:27:41.740 --> 2:27:45.260]  right group they have an audio sermon of co-staying because you know how Jesus
[2:27:45.260 --> 2:27:49.140]  said you got to put me before your mother father brother sister he says
[2:27:49.140 --> 2:27:53.380]  well Hitler now that's what they taught the kids direct quote because now we
[2:27:53.380 --> 2:27:57.260]  even had the kids killing their parents but it wasn't murder see because it was
[2:27:57.260 --> 2:28:03.260]  for building the new nation the new kingdom my god this guy I mean this is
[2:28:03.260 --> 2:28:07.420]  incredible and you were there this is published it's in your book and I'm
[2:28:07.420 --> 2:28:12.420]  familiar with the fake right-wing Chicago School of Business all of this
[2:28:12.420 --> 2:28:17.900]  Milton Friedman you know the same so yeah there's a real overlap with those
[2:28:17.900 --> 2:28:21.780]  guys because those guys are all going on this premise of what Plato called the
[2:28:21.780 --> 2:28:25.900]  noble rise the idea that regular folks can't handle the truth and some of these
[2:28:25.900 --> 2:28:29.940]  need to make the decision and that's why they like Machiavelli man but to see see
[2:28:29.940 --> 2:28:33.340]  it's all interconnected I didn't know they were into Straussian I just knew
[2:28:33.340 --> 2:28:38.220]  it fit with the Chicago School man these people are just monstrous but but you
[2:28:38.220 --> 2:28:41.740]  know Obama has got a bunch of the Straussians pulling his strings
[2:28:41.740 --> 2:28:48.780]  family guys in there too Jim Jones you know one of his close advisors guy who's
[2:28:48.780 --> 2:28:54.220]  been on my god general James L. Jones the head of the head of the National
[2:28:54.220 --> 2:28:58.620]  Security Council the real government indeed I'll tell you one that's a little
[2:28:58.620 --> 2:29:02.060]  bit crazy she's not a member of the group she's what they call a friend of the
[2:29:02.060 --> 2:29:05.900]  group and they they're very careful about the distinction she says of Doug
[2:29:05.900 --> 2:29:09.460]  Moses man I was just quoting this language by Hillary now she says he's a
[2:29:09.460 --> 2:29:12.820]  genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide she said she turned to him when
[2:29:12.820 --> 2:29:16.820]  she first came to Washington 1994 who am I talking about but none other than
[2:29:16.820 --> 2:29:22.380]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stop yet let me stop yet so it's
[2:29:22.380 --> 2:29:26.620]  bipartisan hold on we got a break this is blowing me away we're new the full
[2:29:26.620 --> 2:29:30.300]  hour with you too long segments coming up that was a short one see the problem
[2:29:30.300 --> 2:29:33.620]  is I haven't read the book yet I've read a lot of your news articles a lot of
[2:29:33.620 --> 2:29:37.380]  what's in there I've confirmed separate places over the years so I know you're
[2:29:37.380 --> 2:29:42.700]  telling the truth plus they admit you went there and live there so but it's
[2:29:42.700 --> 2:29:48.260]  just all these dots just connected and people kept asking me about CMP CMP CMP

[2:33:25.060 --> 2:33:30.300]  I have a guest on I'm focused I've got notes I got a bunch of facts a few days
[2:33:30.300 --> 2:33:34.980]  ago I saw Mr. Charlotte on Rachel Maddowl I was back in the break room
[2:33:34.980 --> 2:33:39.020]  drinking coffee and eating dinner up here working on a film and I said I've
[2:33:39.020 --> 2:33:42.860]  read his stuff before yeah I know about Ashcroft and all those guys in this
[2:33:42.860 --> 2:33:46.700]  group and I've been doing some more research on that I want to get him on
[2:33:46.700 --> 2:33:50.460]  but Maddowl was making it a left right thing and about how these guys are all
[2:33:50.460 --> 2:33:54.700]  cheating on their wives and how they're hypocrites and I was like I've read his
[2:33:54.700 --> 2:33:58.660]  articles and other articles about this group how it's all Machiavellian and the
[2:33:58.660 --> 2:34:03.660]  end justifies the means and dictators and strong men and I go man that fits
[2:34:03.660 --> 2:34:09.860]  into Chicago school and and and the neocons and you know this whole sick
[2:34:09.860 --> 2:34:16.620]  philosophy that the globalists just kind of used to get well-meaning men to do
[2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:20.700]  evil things the higher up psychopaths are using it as a control system and
[2:34:20.700 --> 2:34:25.300]  it's it's one of many groups but certainly then as he made the connections
[2:34:25.300 --> 2:34:29.860]  to even more powerful organizations and I guess there is something to this you
[2:34:29.860 --> 2:34:33.100]  know I don't get too obsessed on this group or that group I know I found if
[2:34:33.100 --> 2:34:38.900]  it's CFR Trilateral Commission Bilderberg Bohemian Grove then it's every
[2:34:38.900 --> 2:34:42.780]  other group the leadership of these groups are the leadership of all the
[2:34:42.780 --> 2:34:46.580]  other groups and so it's kind of an interlocking director but I'll be honest
[2:34:46.580 --> 2:34:51.540]  now that I heard him roll with info I'd never heard him say on the shows because
[2:34:51.540 --> 2:34:56.500]  they always compartmentalize it it made all these connections because you've
[2:34:56.500 --> 2:35:01.980]  got other secretive right-wing groups like the CMP and I've had guests on over
[2:35:01.980 --> 2:35:05.140]  the years that mentioned that I thought of it more was a right-wing think tank
[2:35:05.140 --> 2:35:09.500]  that were globalist but it also had some anti-globalist in it like the hunt
[2:35:09.500 --> 2:35:14.060]  brothers so that confused me and I don't think anything's the top of the
[2:35:14.060 --> 2:35:17.940]  pyramid I think at the top of the pyramid it's all these groups nexus sing
[2:35:17.940 --> 2:35:22.340]  in but then I didn't know there was a opus-day connection I just threw it out
[2:35:22.340 --> 2:35:26.620]  there he said yes and listen to the names and then a Pentagon connection with
[2:35:26.620 --> 2:35:29.860]  the head of national security that's what's really is the real shadow
[2:35:29.860 --> 2:35:37.460]  government James L. Jones and the Chicago School and the neocons and so you
[2:35:37.460 --> 2:35:42.140]  just blew me away you just got my attention and so I want to get more in
[2:35:42.140 --> 2:35:45.300]  the opus-day connection more than national security connection take your
[2:35:45.300 --> 2:35:50.660]  time on Hillary as a friend take your time on their missions their operations
[2:35:50.660 --> 2:35:53.660]  what they're doing worldwide I know you covered all in the book I've read part
[2:35:53.660 --> 2:35:58.180]  of it just out and already a best-seller the family Jeff Charlotte bit but Jeff
[2:35:58.180 --> 2:36:03.620]  go ahead run through it all give us the you know the key information here and
[2:36:03.620 --> 2:36:08.500]  bottom line just from knowing when I know about separate groups that nexus in
[2:36:08.500 --> 2:36:14.020]  this does sound pretty pretty sinister yeah I'm glad you're saying that Alex
[2:36:14.020 --> 2:36:16.980]  I think you're exactly right we never want to make a mistake if there's one
[2:36:16.980 --> 2:36:20.980]  group that controls at all there's multiple power bases and you know the
[2:36:20.980 --> 2:36:24.620]  point I'm trying to make here is the family is one of the most influential
[2:36:24.620 --> 2:36:29.260]  power bases and yet hasn't measured a sociologist conservative sociologist
[2:36:29.260 --> 2:36:32.700]  actually that happens down there in Texas at the right University did a
[2:36:32.700 --> 2:36:39.780]  survey of 360 politicians in Washington asking them to name the the
[2:36:39.780 --> 2:36:45.180]  religious group it is most influential one in three name the family that's more
[2:36:45.180 --> 2:36:49.420]  than any other group got there was more votes than James Dawson focused on the
[2:36:49.420 --> 2:36:52.740]  family more than any other group they named the family and what's crazy about
[2:36:52.740 --> 2:36:57.300]  this is the family denies that they exist if you call up the leader of the
[2:36:57.300 --> 2:37:01.580]  group as I had NBC News did last year where I did a segment with them and they
[2:37:01.580 --> 2:37:05.020]  said oh no there's nothing to see here we don't exist there's no group because
[2:37:05.020 --> 2:37:08.900]  the group of friends fortunately I had already shared with NBC News their tax
[2:37:08.900 --> 2:37:13.740]  records and the 600 boxes of documents that show I think something that does
[2:37:13.740 --> 2:37:18.780]  indeed go beyond left and right this is a group about power you know again I'll
[2:37:18.780 --> 2:37:22.380]  just repeat that saying that they have we work with power where we can build
[2:37:22.380 --> 2:37:26.860]  new power where we can't what that means is unlike some right-wing groups that
[2:37:26.860 --> 2:37:30.620]  are just sort of extension to the Republican Party the family wants
[2:37:30.620 --> 2:37:34.860]  connections to to Democrat as well one is a center mark prior
[2:37:34.860 --> 2:37:42.780]  Arkansas pro-war Democrat from Arkansas and so they're apolitical they they
[2:37:42.780 --> 2:37:46.420]  want power they're not apolitical they're not apolitical I wouldn't say that they
[2:37:46.420 --> 2:37:51.100]  want power they have specific and one is they believe in sort of a free market
[2:37:51.100 --> 2:37:55.500]  fundamentalism they believe I'm apolitical I meant I meant they don't
[2:37:55.500 --> 2:37:59.540]  care about labels they don't care about labels they care about power right they
[2:37:59.540 --> 2:38:03.060]  care about power and their agenda and agenda two things it's free market
[2:38:03.060 --> 2:38:06.820]  fundamentalism and it's American Empire that's what they've been working on for
[2:38:06.820 --> 2:38:13.220]  70 years and I heard the lead-in so you may appreciate this one back in 1945 the
[2:38:13.220 --> 2:38:16.780]  leader of the group Abraham Brady I believe coin is free I believe he may
[2:38:16.780 --> 2:38:20.060]  have been the first one to use it all I think you'll know if I'm wrong he said
[2:38:20.060 --> 2:38:27.300]  there's a coming new world order and 1945 that is documented in their
[2:38:27.300 --> 2:38:32.140]  archives with anyone yeah I don't think he coined it but the fact that he used
[2:38:32.140 --> 2:38:37.500]  it Hitler used Hitler used it HD Wells wrote a book called the New World Order
[2:38:37.500 --> 2:38:44.340]  yeah yeah he was he was an interesting admirer of Hitler basically they said
[2:38:44.340 --> 2:38:50.060]  that they they said what we're gaining for is a form of totalitarianism they
[2:38:50.060 --> 2:38:54.620]  said how about a fascist dictatorship yeah Hitler is one of the earliest you
[2:38:54.620 --> 2:38:59.820]  can't find right around the same time Hitler starts using it then HD Wells
[2:38:59.820 --> 2:39:04.220]  uses it but they both wanted different forms of socialism Hitler a more
[2:39:04.220 --> 2:39:07.420]  fascist form though they're supposedly on different ends of the spectrum
[2:39:07.420 --> 2:39:12.460]  national socialists the nonsense and then the Hitler wanted to have somebody
[2:39:12.460 --> 2:39:16.620]  kidnapped and kill HD Wells so like you said there's competing there's
[2:39:16.620 --> 2:39:21.660]  competing factions but but to go ahead well I mean you know that's what you
[2:39:21.660 --> 2:39:26.420]  know when I said that the bottom line of the American Empire and in that's what
[2:39:26.420 --> 2:39:31.260]  led them into alliances you know we were talking before the break about their
[2:39:31.260 --> 2:39:34.860]  role and sort of whitewashing the record of former Nazis one with a guy named
[2:39:34.860 --> 2:39:39.460]  Herman Jay at was vice president of the German operation after the war became
[2:39:39.460 --> 2:39:44.820]  known as the Wizard of the West German miracle brilliant financier until it
[2:39:44.820 --> 2:39:48.940]  was discovered that before he was Germany's banker he was the man known as
[2:39:48.940 --> 2:39:54.620]  Hitler's banker he in fact had helped speared away untold amount of German
[2:39:54.620 --> 2:39:59.860]  money to the Nazis escaped to South America oh my so we have a Nazi connection
[2:39:59.860 --> 2:40:04.180]  with money coming over because we know the bushes with Prescott have that
[2:40:04.180 --> 2:40:08.380]  connection well there's more than that they're the head of the Swiss operation
[2:40:08.380 --> 2:40:12.500]  after the war with a banker named Alfred hers to use the family in its access
[2:40:12.500 --> 2:40:18.820]  to American politicians to come over and lobby for America to lay off all
[2:40:18.820 --> 2:40:23.780]  the money that of course they had stolen from other Swiss banks have gone from
[2:40:23.780 --> 2:40:28.700]  the Jews who had been killed and then you know the so-called Nazi gold you know
[2:40:28.700 --> 2:40:31.860]  we forget that there were actually early attempts to investigate that stuff and
[2:40:31.860 --> 2:40:35.340]  Alfred hers working through congress milling center out out into Wiley from
[2:40:35.340 --> 2:40:40.940]  Wisconsin others was able to lobby successfully using this group network
[2:40:40.940 --> 2:40:45.660]  that's really what this is the group that blocked the investigation of the
[2:40:45.660 --> 2:40:49.620]  rat line in the gold and diamonds they were a group you know I think you made
[2:40:49.620 --> 2:40:52.940]  an important point there's no single group can controlling all this stuff but
[2:40:52.940 --> 2:40:56.820]  there's lots of different power bases in Washington yeah it's like a swarm of
[2:40:56.820 --> 2:41:01.420]  viruses or something it's a whole bunch of them but going in the same direction
[2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:05.660]  more power more control specifically let's get more into that history but can
[2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:09.420]  you backtrack because I read your articles years ago and Harper's and
[2:41:09.420 --> 2:41:13.980]  Rolling Stone can remember just reading this and then going and googling some of
[2:41:13.980 --> 2:41:16.260]  it and finding that you know you were telling the truth because it was so
[2:41:16.260 --> 2:41:21.300]  shocking about their philosophy and we don't care about abortion we want Jesus
[2:41:21.300 --> 2:41:25.900]  wants power we don't care about you know this and that we like Machiavelli I
[2:41:25.900 --> 2:41:31.820]  mean this sounds like a psycho cult masquerading as Christians well let me
[2:41:31.820 --> 2:41:36.220]  give you let me give you a quote this is this is from the news and we had in that
[2:41:36.220 --> 2:41:39.980]  lead and we had a congressman Todd Fee are talking about abortion it's not that
[2:41:39.980 --> 2:41:43.180]  they don't care about those issues the group tends to be pretty right wing
[2:41:43.180 --> 2:41:46.140]  conservative so they can't this is not the bottom line the bottom line is
[2:41:46.140 --> 2:41:50.700]  American Empire but one time I was at the C Street house this is the house in
[2:41:50.700 --> 2:41:53.860]  Washington where they're providing below market housing for congressmen the
[2:41:53.860 --> 2:41:57.700]  public and then Democrats by the way this is a bipartisan thing it was by
[2:41:57.700 --> 2:42:02.860]  partisan power loss you might say and I was there and Doug Coe the leader of the
[2:42:02.860 --> 2:42:07.500]  group with counseling congressman Todd Feehart and Todd Feehart come in Todd
[2:42:07.500 --> 2:42:12.180]  Feehart is not what you would call the light man he said he was concerned
[2:42:12.180 --> 2:42:17.380]  that the Christian was losing the race with the Muslim and you know he sort of
[2:42:17.380 --> 2:42:20.820]  what is this guy talking about this is crazy what he meant was he said that
[2:42:20.820 --> 2:42:25.860]  Muslims are having too many babies while Christians are not having enough so
[2:42:25.860 --> 2:42:29.340]  turns out Feehart represents himself as an ardent form of abortion what he
[2:42:29.340 --> 2:42:33.140]  means is abortion for Christians he doesn't care if Muslims have abortions
[2:42:33.140 --> 2:42:37.060]  in fact he would like that well now Doug Coe listening to this is okay yeah I
[2:42:37.060 --> 2:42:40.620]  hear you talking about this abortion issue you know I sort of agree with you
[2:42:40.620 --> 2:42:45.180]  on that and that's fine but I want you to think bigger bigger what I want you
[2:42:45.180 --> 2:42:49.260]  to do is to think in terms of a covenant and describe the covenant and something
[2:42:49.260 --> 2:42:55.860]  that men or of power enter into secretly privately because of a publicly
[2:42:55.860 --> 2:42:58.940]  invisible but privately identifiable group of companions that's in their
[2:42:58.940 --> 2:43:02.740]  official documents is a covenant he said with a covenant you can do so much more
[2:43:02.740 --> 2:43:06.660]  you should think of men with a covenant you should think of the mafia and then
[2:43:06.660 --> 2:43:10.620]  I'm just direct quoting here here's his examples of where he looks for his
[2:43:10.620 --> 2:43:16.260]  leadership lessons Hitler Pol Pot Osama bin Laden in London so all we can see
[2:43:16.260 --> 2:43:22.180]  here is that he was an equal opportunity admirer of killers good Lord but
[2:43:22.180 --> 2:43:26.740]  again when you're saying all of this I'm thinking about the Straussian
[2:43:26.740 --> 2:43:31.820]  economist and philosophers I'm thinking about the Chicago School the Rockefellers
[2:43:31.820 --> 2:43:36.940]  the Rockefellers similarly funded other schools of thought you ever run into
[2:43:36.940 --> 2:43:41.180]  Rockefeller foundations or Rockefeller money in all this yeah Rockefeller and
[2:43:41.180 --> 2:43:44.740]  maybe more but in the early days of the family the Rockefeller Foundation of
[2:43:44.740 --> 2:43:49.100]  course gone through a lot of different incarnations you know at one point it
[2:43:49.100 --> 2:43:53.660]  was a sense almost a fund for CIA money and that's been documented pretty well
[2:43:53.660 --> 2:43:58.300]  and it's found in modern eugenics yeah yeah in the early days they were indeed
[2:43:58.300 --> 2:44:02.460]  giving the family which was then known as international Christian leadership
[2:44:02.460 --> 2:44:09.740]  became their name every few years they say to to avoid scrutiny basically but
[2:44:09.740 --> 2:44:13.540]  they gave he gave some money to them to get started I mean you really see all
[2:44:13.540 --> 2:44:16.900]  the titans of American commerce but you always have the Rockefellers I mean
[2:44:16.900 --> 2:44:21.060]  discovering cancer viruses Rockefellers setting up them I mean just the whole
[2:44:21.060 --> 2:44:25.100]  system set was set up by these people I see I didn't know that you're the expert
[2:44:25.100 --> 2:44:27.660]  of course they're involved it's kind of like you lived up a stone and that's
[2:44:27.660 --> 2:44:31.380]  where you find the bugs but but look other key points I'm interrupting this
[2:44:31.380 --> 2:44:36.660]  just gets more insane is their power getting greater is it waning do you get
[2:44:36.660 --> 2:44:44.340]  threats I mean what is it like I tell I mean this is almost maybe the comic
[2:44:44.340 --> 2:44:46.700]  section of the book that you know because that's written about this in
[2:44:46.700 --> 2:44:50.940]  Harper's so in chapter nine of the book the family I talk about some of the
[2:44:50.940 --> 2:44:55.860]  early reactions one was speaking in Germany get over there turns out the
[2:44:55.860 --> 2:44:59.580]  whole speaking series is paid for by the US Embassy get off the plane my
[2:44:59.580 --> 2:45:03.460]  German host says you know there's a problem your ambassador says that he
[2:45:03.460 --> 2:45:06.660]  cannot pay for you because you are an enemy of Jesus but this is this is the
[2:45:06.660 --> 2:45:10.140]  adaptive United States is saying this kind of thing who is it the guy named
[2:45:10.140 --> 2:45:13.460]  Heather Dan Coates not the brightest bulb on the porch you can sit at Dan
[2:45:13.460 --> 2:45:19.260]  Quayle his mentor a guy so off the charts that when Bush proposed him for
[2:45:19.260 --> 2:45:25.220]  Secretary of Defense Cheney vetoed him as two fanatical you that's that kind of
[2:45:25.220 --> 2:45:30.460]  guy but the more even one of the other responses was a phone call again from one
[2:45:30.460 --> 2:45:35.500]  day from a guy who's an executive for the oil company pride former very big
[2:45:35.500 --> 2:45:39.100]  international company involved in this stuff he's calling me from Angola
[2:45:39.100 --> 2:45:43.340]  says he's just a fan of my work that great call from Angola from a fan of my
[2:45:43.340 --> 2:45:48.740]  work as we talked for a good long while it turns out he's a member of the
[2:45:48.740 --> 2:45:53.020]  family he's actually trying to recruit me back into it so I try and get some
[2:45:53.020 --> 2:45:56.820]  counter argument but what about the family's involvement in Indonesia the
[2:45:56.820 --> 2:46:01.020]  dictator the heart of killed 1.2 million of his own people and his only
[2:46:01.020 --> 2:46:05.820]  counter argument is that must be what God wanted for Indonesia 1.2 million
[2:46:05.820 --> 2:46:10.500]  people dead that was that was God's will the truth is they're playing God that's
[2:46:10.500 --> 2:46:14.620]  what this whole power trips about yeah you know it was it was very well put to
[2:46:14.620 --> 2:46:18.220]  me by him I didn't interview with someone from the Cato Institute which is a
[2:46:18.220 --> 2:46:22.380]  very conservative think tank in Washington and they really believe in
[2:46:22.380 --> 2:46:25.500]  free markets and so I thought they weren't gonna like the book but they
[2:46:25.500 --> 2:46:28.580]  looked at me for these guys I'm talking about free markets there's nothing free
[2:46:28.580 --> 2:46:32.460]  about this is crony capitalism the phrase they use I thought was really just
[2:46:32.460 --> 2:46:36.620]  dead on with self-interest by proxy these guys get together in a small group
[2:46:36.620 --> 2:46:39.180]  that's what a prayer cell that's what senator and then we've been hearing about
[2:46:39.180 --> 2:46:43.380]  governor Stanford those guys dinner Cobra and they get together in a prayer cell
[2:46:43.380 --> 2:46:45.860]  they don't actually read the Bible I've been there for these things they don't
[2:46:45.860 --> 2:46:49.580]  actually study the Bible one man will say you know I have a message from Jesus I
[2:46:49.580 --> 2:46:53.800]  think Jesus gave me a message for you and in the case of Senator infant and
[2:46:53.800 --> 2:46:58.220]  Coburn the message seemed to be a pay your mischief and harsh money to keep
[2:46:58.220 --> 2:47:01.740]  yourself out of the public eye but you know the one thing that's really
[2:47:01.740 --> 2:47:04.940]  important about that whole scandal and you mentioned talking about on that out
[2:47:04.940 --> 2:47:08.820]  and so on and then folks on the fact you know the Republicans the more important
[2:47:08.820 --> 2:47:12.100]  thing is that I don't care about this exact game exactly the question is I
[2:47:12.100 --> 2:47:15.300]  don't want you to get in a fight with with Madel but why is the media always
[2:47:15.300 --> 2:47:20.140]  left now is one of the very few people pushing the story I mean this story
[2:47:20.140 --> 2:47:23.620]  been around for a while and I'm not every now and then someone makes it and
[2:47:23.620 --> 2:47:27.660]  the Los Angeles Times to the year-long investigation 2002 published their
[2:47:27.660 --> 2:47:32.060]  results incredible stuff linking the family to Central American desk blocks
[2:47:32.060 --> 2:47:35.240]  all kinds of stuff expected you know waited for the pure to the pure
[2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:40.300]  surprised winning reporter get it not up peep last year I did a segment with NBC
[2:47:40.300 --> 2:47:44.780]  Nightly News with Andrew Mitchell hosting and we had Hillary Clinton talking
[2:47:44.780 --> 2:47:48.500]  about her involvement we had video of Doug Koh talking about the great
[2:47:48.500 --> 2:47:52.740]  leadership example of the fellowship that he tries to promote it like that
[2:47:52.740 --> 2:47:58.100]  one enjoyed by Hitler, Himmler, and During and you know NBC thought they had the
[2:47:58.100 --> 2:48:02.420]  scoop of the campaign season not up peep because our American political press
[2:48:02.420 --> 2:48:06.940]  they're religiously illiterate they don't know the questions to ask and you know
[2:48:06.940 --> 2:48:13.580]  Hitler was a freak I mean why why this obsession with Hitler
[2:48:13.580 --> 2:48:20.060]  it's it's it's the most extreme I mean in some ways it's sort of it is very
[2:48:20.060 --> 2:48:24.340]  literally idiotic you know it's a at one point I asked someone that when I was
[2:48:24.340 --> 2:48:28.380]  living with this guy that said I find this very troubling they said well it's
[2:48:28.380 --> 2:48:33.820]  not his end that we're interested in it's his methods and you just you just
[2:48:33.820 --> 2:48:38.020]  blown away by that but even that they've been somebody's behavior is the
[2:48:38.020 --> 2:48:43.020]  manifestation of who they are exactly exactly well and it was methods were
[2:48:43.020 --> 2:48:46.380]  absolutely horrific but they misunderstand those days they like to talk
[2:48:46.380 --> 2:48:49.980]  about they say look here's what Hitler did Hitler got together with a little
[2:48:49.980 --> 2:48:54.900]  group of friends in a back of a Bavarian beer hall and working together it's like
[2:48:54.900 --> 2:48:58.940]  you guys are gonna work together whether it's better in front of Colbert or two
[2:48:58.940 --> 2:49:02.140]  younger guys in the group just like you work together what would they able to do
[2:49:02.140 --> 2:49:06.900]  they were able to take over the world that's the same thing it is again
[2:49:06.900 --> 2:49:11.700]  Hitler killed all his friends actually Hitler also what this is mainline
[2:49:11.700 --> 2:49:16.260]  history was hired by German intelligence to set that group up to monitor
[2:49:16.260 --> 2:49:20.060]  people and then it got some British funding later from the king of England
[2:49:20.060 --> 2:49:26.740]  Edward VIII and so Hitler didn't just pop up out of a cabbage patch well the
[2:49:26.740 --> 2:49:30.660]  important thing to recognize with these guys is that they're they're all sort of
[2:49:30.660 --> 2:49:34.900]  power hungry political opportunities and I think that's what you get with the
[2:49:34.900 --> 2:49:38.620]  family you know the thing about it is look a lot of the young guys I live with
[2:49:38.620 --> 2:49:42.220]  even some of the congressmen I've spoken to they get involved with the best of
[2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:46.060]  intention they really genuinely do I'll even say that a senator Brown back yeah
[2:49:46.060 --> 2:49:56.020]  that's like congressmen go into Kim the head of the Washington Times Mr. Moon I
[2:49:56.020 --> 2:49:59.980]  mean total cult and they said we didn't know that this was gonna be a crowning
[2:49:59.980 --> 2:50:04.580]  ceremony as him as the Messiah there they are embarrassed gulping as crowns are
[2:50:04.580 --> 2:50:09.140]  being put on his head how does that individual tie into all this you know
[2:50:09.140 --> 2:50:12.140]  there's a big overlap there but that's it you know that yet again a distinct
[2:50:12.140 --> 2:50:17.060]  distinct power bases but there is that overlap in that example that you give
[2:50:17.060 --> 2:50:20.980]  though we didn't know I think that's been in the news again I emphasize the
[2:50:20.980 --> 2:50:25.100]  bipartisan aspect of this the congressman Bart Stupak of Michigan has been
[2:50:25.100 --> 2:50:30.740]  living for seven years in this house run by the family getting subsidized rent
[2:50:30.740 --> 2:50:35.100]  which is a gift which he should be reporting what you haven't and when
[2:50:35.100 --> 2:50:39.300]  the when the Michigan press asked about this he said gee I didn't know I just
[2:50:39.300 --> 2:50:44.260]  walked by these foreign policy meetings in my dining room accepted this cheap
[2:50:44.260 --> 2:50:48.860]  rent and I never bothered to ask questions it's just not plausible to say
[2:50:48.860 --> 2:50:53.180]  you didn't know at that point there's also a Bohemian Grove connection you
[2:50:53.180 --> 2:50:58.060]  know what Nixon said about that anyway sir stay there we're gonna come right

[2:54:24.460 --> 2:54:27.580]  flu fear mongering all of this but Jeff Charlotte I gotta have him back up in
[2:54:27.580 --> 2:54:36.220]  their future Jeff charlotte.com charlotte spelled S-H-A-R-L-E-T.com the book is the
[2:54:36.220 --> 2:54:41.860]  family will put that up on screen but here is mr. moon son young moon the
[2:54:41.860 --> 2:54:48.580]  head of the moonies having crowns put on saying he's above Jesus and I don't try
[2:54:48.580 --> 2:54:51.460]  to get in fights with all these religious groups and all this it's just
[2:54:51.460 --> 2:54:56.020]  that when they try to get political power and have secretive agendas they
[2:54:56.020 --> 2:54:59.740]  have to be discussed and and I expose everything here that's all we're trying
[2:54:59.740 --> 2:55:04.580]  to do and this is freakish and there's nothing Christian about John Ashcroft
[2:55:04.580 --> 2:55:07.900]  and his Patriot Act and the rest of it there's nothing liberal about Barack
[2:55:07.900 --> 2:55:13.780]  Obama hiring nothing but K Street boys now and swearing he never would but I
[2:55:13.780 --> 2:55:16.500]  want to come back in this final five-minute segment a few minutes to
[2:55:16.500 --> 2:55:20.780]  take two or three calls but first in the four or five minutes we have left in
[2:55:20.780 --> 2:55:24.940]  this segment other key points you haven't told us about as you're giving us the
[2:55:24.940 --> 2:55:30.940]  dirt on these individuals well I think the really the biggest point that we
[2:55:30.940 --> 2:55:34.820]  want to look at is how the family is acting like a lobby they're not
[2:55:34.820 --> 2:55:37.900]  registered as a lobby but they're paying for travel for congressmen to go
[2:55:37.900 --> 2:55:45.700]  overseas and Jim in off of Oklahoma went on at least 20 missionary trips to
[2:55:45.700 --> 2:55:49.900]  Africa who pay for it in that case he actually finagled he says he went on
[2:55:49.900 --> 2:55:53.820]  behalf of the family promoting the political philosophy of Jesus as talked
[2:55:53.820 --> 2:55:58.820]  to him by Doug Cobb so it's a tax-exempt lobby on top of it back to get
[2:55:58.820 --> 2:56:01.820]  there but in his case he went even further he actually got the Senate
[2:56:01.820 --> 2:56:07.140]  Armed Services Committee to pay for it $187,000 he went to the president of
[2:56:07.140 --> 2:56:10.900]  Nigeria State Department didn't want him to meet with him went there he got
[2:56:10.900 --> 2:56:14.100]  Senator Coburn going to Lebanon this is a country that's that civil war between
[2:56:14.100 --> 2:56:17.860]  Christians and Muslims for a long long time they do not need this kind of
[2:56:17.860 --> 2:56:21.780]  interference Senator Coburn went there and he said you know what on his
[2:56:21.780 --> 2:56:24.620]  official form paid for by the family about one of their foundations
[2:56:24.620 --> 2:56:29.500]  International Foundation says I'm going to set up a confidential Christian
[2:56:29.500 --> 2:56:33.060]  prayer cells and the Lebanese government just like the one who used to help
[2:56:33.060 --> 2:56:37.540]  cover up the political affairs of Senator and so the script is doing this
[2:56:37.540 --> 2:56:40.980]  stuff and when we dig into their own history we dig into their own archives
[2:56:40.980 --> 2:56:45.260]  we don't have to accuse them or make any wild-eyed you know claims and so on we
[2:56:45.260 --> 2:56:49.180]  see an absolutely bloody history and how are you getting into their archives
[2:56:49.180 --> 2:56:54.300]  they dumped 600 boxes of unorganized papers in the Billy Graham Center
[2:56:54.300 --> 2:56:58.500]  archive and I went there I was one of the very first people to start poking
[2:56:58.500 --> 2:57:03.900]  around and we're talking about budgets memos formal core correspondence
[2:57:03.900 --> 2:57:08.500]  even confidential government documents a lot of stuff on congressional why is it
[2:57:08.500 --> 2:57:11.620]  at the Billy Graham Center is he involved
[2:57:11.620 --> 2:57:17.300]  originally but not too much a little bit I think he's got his his own thing
[2:57:17.300 --> 2:57:21.500]  going but Billy Graham did help them set up this annual ritual which has become
[2:57:21.500 --> 2:57:24.860]  sort of an annual lobbying festival called the National Prayer Breakfast in
[2:57:24.860 --> 2:57:28.260]  Washington every year everybody attends the president attends Congress
[2:57:28.260 --> 2:57:33.700]  attends it's ostensibly ecumenical everybody is represented internal
[2:57:33.700 --> 2:57:37.580]  documents that anything could happen even the Quran could be read and by that
[2:57:37.580 --> 2:57:41.340]  they meant they're referring to a Saudi prince Bandar who they invited to speak
[2:57:41.340 --> 2:57:45.780]  he said but Jesus is there he's infiltrating the world and by Jesus of
[2:57:45.780 --> 2:57:50.020]  course you just have to remember they're not talking about anything you ever
[2:57:50.020 --> 2:57:54.180]  learned in Sunday school they're talking about the idea of American Empire they're
[2:57:54.180 --> 2:57:58.260]  talking about the idea they're talking about the Hitler Jesus now but they
[2:57:58.260 --> 2:58:02.060]  hit the Jesus of strength and power rather than the one of love and
[2:58:02.060 --> 2:58:10.260]  forgiveness yes well look obviously intelligence agencies love to use
[2:58:10.260 --> 2:58:13.860]  missionaries and groups like this and as you said the Rockefeller's deeply
[2:58:13.860 --> 2:58:18.460]  involved in that so this is obvious obviously just one more powerful group
[2:58:18.460 --> 2:58:21.660]  and all of this and I would imagine you would say even some of the people
[2:58:21.660 --> 2:58:25.420]  involved are doing so they believe for good reasons I think that's what it's
[2:58:25.420 --> 2:58:32.060]  for is to co-opt well-meaning Christian men to kind of warp their sense for the
[2:58:32.060 --> 2:58:36.900]  end justifies the means to then go carry out really bad stuff but we'll get your
[2:58:36.900 --> 2:58:43.940]  take on that in 70 seconds and take a couple phone calls thank you for
[2:58:43.940 --> 2:58:52.700]  listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with
[2:58:52.700 --> 2:58:56.300]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this
[2:58:56.300 --> 2:59:00.060]  summer number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[2:59:00.060 --> 2:59:04.060]  electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[2:59:04.060 --> 2:59:08.020]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[2:59:08.020 --> 2:59:11.980]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[2:59:11.980 --> 2:59:15.900]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:59:15.900 --> 2:59:19.540]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[2:59:19.540 --> 2:59:22.860]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of
[2:59:22.860 --> 2:59:26.780]  families lose their power from weather related outages number five a solar
[2:59:26.780 --> 2:59:30.620]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[2:59:30.620 --> 2:59:33.740]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[2:59:52.180 --> 3:00:01.340]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[3:00:22.340 --> 3:00:27.740]  I think the moral to the story is power-seeking individuals love to array
[3:00:27.740 --> 3:00:34.740]  themselves in fraternal secretive arrays and we'll be looking more at the CMP
[3:00:34.740 --> 3:00:41.060]  more at the the family I've seen it referred to in similar groups as
[3:00:41.060 --> 3:00:46.420]  brotherhoods there's the Masonic networks as well but those are all
[3:00:46.420 --> 3:00:51.500]  compartmentalized and buried but at the top the superclass that Rothkopf talked
[3:00:51.500 --> 3:00:55.340]  about the head of the history group on the show it's just six thousand global
[3:00:55.340 --> 3:00:59.100]  controllers that are the heads of all these groups and then they manage the
[3:00:59.100 --> 3:01:03.180]  whole planet through that system and that's the message that I try to get out
[3:01:03.180 --> 3:01:07.980]  most importantly Brian in Iowa you're on the air with the author of this new
[3:01:07.980 --> 3:01:12.340]  book Jeff charlotte.com's the website go ahead we're taking my call good
[3:01:12.340 --> 3:01:16.580]  afternoon gentlemen as a quick comment I just like to say Alex at first it's
[3:01:16.580 --> 3:01:19.900]  interesting that yesterday you had Robert Gibbs on and then today you've got
[3:01:19.900 --> 3:01:25.380]  all the regs like reekbird AP drudge USA today coming out with articles going
[3:01:25.380 --> 3:01:28.420]  against everything that you guys talked about yesterday just kind of kind of
[3:01:28.420 --> 3:01:31.620]  something that was crazy I mean I just said this is not an original bird
[3:01:31.620 --> 3:01:36.580]  certificate that's why it's getting so big we just discussed it and I don't I
[3:01:36.580 --> 3:01:40.620]  think it I noticed it was getting real big so I'm getting back into covering it
[3:01:40.620 --> 3:01:44.780]  now I don't think Politico and all them are attacking us just because I covered
[3:01:44.780 --> 3:01:52.940]  it but it is true that that on top of all of this Chris Matthews did say
[3:01:52.940 --> 3:01:58.900]  you're mentally ill if you question Obama's birth but the health director of
[3:01:58.900 --> 3:02:02.660]  Hawaii coming out and saying that it was it was also we've proven it and it's
[3:02:02.660 --> 3:02:06.780]  already out there listen no I appreciate your call I'm not trying to be mean the
[3:02:06.780 --> 3:02:10.260]  guest stayed over just to take questions for himself so I appreciate your call
[3:02:10.260 --> 3:02:16.100]  Brian let's see if John Ohio wants talk to the guest go ahead John yes I was
[3:02:16.100 --> 3:02:21.420]  aware of the connections to the of Hillary Clinton and James Jones to this
[3:02:21.420 --> 3:02:25.780]  this organization and interestingly I saw a very critical
[3:02:25.780 --> 3:02:30.300]  expose of that on the world socialist website some many months ago maybe a
[3:02:30.300 --> 3:02:34.500]  year ago so I think what we're seeing here and incidentally I hope you'd have
[3:02:34.500 --> 3:02:39.300]  somebody on from the black agenda report black agenda report dot com because
[3:02:39.300 --> 3:02:44.220]  this is one black organization very erudite that completely blows the
[3:02:44.220 --> 3:02:49.780]  pretense that Obama cares about black lights or anybody else and I remember
[3:02:49.780 --> 3:02:54.420]  a Webster Carpley commending them about a week ago on his a program so I think
[3:02:54.420 --> 3:02:58.300]  this would be a very good antidote to those that set up the black agenda report
[3:02:58.300 --> 3:03:01.340]  John do you have a question for our guests we got about a minute and a half
[3:03:01.340 --> 3:03:07.660]  left here right now you mentioned that free up that the free market of
[3:03:07.660 --> 3:03:12.180]  fundamentalism imperialism war and empire are really what they're about and if
[3:03:12.180 --> 3:03:17.260]  you look at the people like James Jones and his connections to the console on
[3:03:17.260 --> 3:03:20.220]  foreign relations and Hillary's connections to console on foreign
[3:03:20.220 --> 3:03:25.260]  relations you see that that these are these people are not liberals they're
[3:03:25.260 --> 3:03:33.060]  not socialist they are operatives of the same fake liberal organizations that
[3:03:33.060 --> 3:03:36.780]  are used in a disguise for these really fundamentally very organization let me
[3:03:36.780 --> 3:03:41.060]  get a comment from him on that your take on what John from Ohio was just saying
[3:03:41.060 --> 3:03:45.780]  mr. I think I think John gets is the one good point which is that a lot of the
[3:03:45.780 --> 3:03:49.500]  powerful folks involved in this we want to not be distracted by the labels like
[3:03:49.500 --> 3:03:53.820]  liberals and conservative rather I think we want to look at how are they
[3:03:53.820 --> 3:03:58.100]  serving this project of American Empire versus American democracy that's a
[3:03:58.100 --> 3:04:01.860]  bottom line which do you believe in democracy or empire the family has
[3:04:01.860 --> 3:04:04.460]  thrown its lot in with empire and they've been able to bring a lot of
[3:04:04.460 --> 3:04:10.220]  powerful congressmen and and and other officials with them some of them most of
[3:04:10.220 --> 3:04:13.900]  them are labeled as conservative some of them labeled as liberals all of them
[3:04:13.900 --> 3:04:18.740]  interested in serving this empire project rather than the democratic
[3:04:18.740 --> 3:04:27.580]  project and the point I want to make is that we pay for this empire so many
[3:04:27.580 --> 3:04:31.460]  Americans feel like yeah kill them brown people take their oil and I've heard a
[3:04:31.460 --> 3:04:35.580]  lot of people on talk radio yeah we're taking the brown people's oil it's kind
[3:04:35.580 --> 3:04:40.860]  of a redneck clan thing hey dummies you're paying for all this you don't
[3:04:40.860 --> 3:04:45.100]  get it the big banks the offshore corporations do stop thinking you're
[3:04:45.100 --> 3:04:49.300]  part of the power structure well Jeff Charlotte I appreciate you coming on

[3:09:28.300 --> 3:09:31.340]  i've actually been listening to your radio show for about seven years i'm a
[3:09:31.340 --> 3:09:35.100]  member of prisonplanet tv and i actually got into it when i first
[3:09:35.100 --> 3:09:38.540]  started listening to you i kind of got uh thrown off because you
[3:09:38.540 --> 3:09:42.140]  have a very eccentric personality and then when i actually
[3:09:42.140 --> 3:09:45.180]  listened to one of your radio shows you said don't take my word for it i
[3:09:45.180 --> 3:09:47.740]  challenge you go and look for the information okay go ahead
[3:09:47.740 --> 3:09:52.060]  everything that you come up with i go and i do a research on it
[3:09:52.060 --> 3:09:55.580]  and for the first like four or five years everything that you've come up
[3:09:55.580 --> 3:09:58.140]  with i've always been able to verify through everything
[3:09:58.140 --> 3:10:01.820]  i've only had one thing that i've never been able to i've
[3:10:01.820 --> 3:10:05.660]  that you've uh mentioned on your show that i've actually found the exact
[3:10:05.660 --> 3:10:10.380]  opposite um you haven't had two individuals by the name of
[3:10:10.380 --> 3:10:15.020]  robert minard or john harrison they're actually there's a group in
[3:10:15.020 --> 3:10:19.740]  um uk part of the we are change group a guy named uh
[3:10:19.740 --> 3:10:23.500]  his name uh darin pilard what they've done is they've
[3:10:23.500 --> 3:10:26.540]  they've told the government they don't consent to anything they don't want to
[3:10:26.540 --> 3:10:30.220]  be part of it they're removing themselves from the entire government
[3:10:30.220 --> 3:10:33.500]  and you've brought up the stuff about straw man and stuff before
[3:10:33.500 --> 3:10:37.420]  well these guys have actually gone to court right up against the people
[3:10:37.420 --> 3:10:41.260]  fronted out or showed them their actual let's just stop right there
[3:10:41.260 --> 3:10:44.860]  stop right there you're saying you found something i said
[3:10:44.860 --> 3:10:52.060]  that isn't accurate um i make mistakes all the time most of my mistakes or
[3:10:52.060 --> 3:10:55.180]  i called it k street the lobbyists because i have an article about obama
[3:10:55.180 --> 3:10:59.100]  getting rid of all lobbying rules worse than bush the lobbyists are openly
[3:10:59.100 --> 3:11:03.260]  writing all the policy and law complete flip flop
[3:11:03.260 --> 3:11:08.140]  i called c street k street so you got to watch me on stuff it's not intentional
[3:11:08.140 --> 3:11:11.260]  you know i flip things around because i'm busy on air
[3:11:11.260 --> 3:11:15.020]  you're bringing up we are change i mean i'm the one that put we are changing the
[3:11:15.020 --> 3:11:18.700]  map when telling people to join luke's group
[3:11:18.700 --> 3:11:22.060]  so i'm or maybe that's not what you're saying i'm lying about or i'm wrong
[3:11:22.060 --> 3:11:25.020]  about what is your point quickly come on
[3:11:25.020 --> 3:11:28.620]  that you're wrong about is the whole reference to the straw man there's uh
[3:11:28.620 --> 3:11:32.620]  in the legal definitions of the word person these people have actually gone
[3:11:32.620 --> 3:11:35.820]  to court i know black's law all of it out
[3:11:35.820 --> 3:11:40.460]  yeah yeah but you go into black's law you can go into the case laws like um
[3:11:40.460 --> 3:11:44.220]  i've got a case law reference here luther versus uh
[3:11:44.220 --> 3:11:51.260]  borden uh for a site 48 us 1849 listen i told you one
[3:11:51.260 --> 3:11:54.540]  one minute of peace and i appreciate your call you got about three
[3:11:54.540 --> 3:11:59.580]  um
[3:11:59.580 --> 3:12:03.980]  it is so hard to respond to this i lovingly
[3:12:03.980 --> 3:12:07.260]  try to stay away from all this stuff because i don't like sending my listeners
[3:12:07.260 --> 3:12:11.660]  to prison okay
[3:12:12.460 --> 3:12:16.380]  if i had a dollar for every quack liar on the radio and tv and i don't know
[3:12:16.380 --> 3:12:21.020]  those people you mentioned so i'm not saying they are
[3:12:21.020 --> 3:12:24.860]  if i had a dollar for every person that claims file this straw man file these
[3:12:24.860 --> 3:12:31.020]  liens get this bond out do this the whole common law system is set that you
[3:12:31.020 --> 3:12:33.420]  can swear to something and go file it but then if it
[3:12:33.420 --> 3:12:36.540]  isn't true you you're going to get in trouble but there's so much of it that
[3:12:36.540 --> 3:12:41.340]  they can't respond to all of it i've had people file fake liens on
[3:12:41.340 --> 3:12:45.500]  me i've had all sorts of stuff go on all i'm saying is there's such a
[3:12:45.500 --> 3:12:49.420]  minefield of dis info and false law out there
[3:12:49.420 --> 3:12:52.460]  certainly the government creates a straw man and gets you to waive rights
[3:12:52.460 --> 3:12:56.860]  through contract and it's a lie to say you got to take vaccines and
[3:12:56.860 --> 3:13:00.140]  i hear lawyers on air saying admiralty only deals with ships
[3:13:00.140 --> 3:13:03.820]  no i've seen federal courts declare admiralty stealing people's property
[3:13:03.820 --> 3:13:07.660]  in the u.s so there's kernels of truth to all this
[3:13:07.660 --> 3:13:13.340]  i just don't get up here and push people into all of these theories about law
[3:13:13.340 --> 3:13:17.020]  and ideas when they don't even know their bill of rights or constitution
[3:13:17.020 --> 3:13:20.380]  now i know there's some freeman societies and groups
[3:13:20.380 --> 3:13:25.020]  that i've seen to do to give some decent decent speeches in england
[3:13:25.020 --> 3:13:28.380]  explaining how the system works and telling the system i'm not going along
[3:13:28.380 --> 3:13:31.980]  with you that is a human declaration as a free
[3:13:31.980 --> 3:13:37.740]  being and creature okay so you don't understand the point i'm
[3:13:37.740 --> 3:13:42.140]  making and what i'm saying so hey go knock yourself out
[3:13:42.140 --> 3:13:45.340]  i just see a lot of people claim they've won this case or claim they've done
[3:13:45.340 --> 3:13:48.300]  this or claim they've done that and it's normally not true
[3:13:48.300 --> 3:13:51.820]  i don't know about those groups you mentioned i'm just saying look out there's
[3:13:51.820 --> 3:13:55.820]  a lot of bull out there i don't steer my giant audience
[3:13:55.820 --> 3:14:01.180]  off into kind of patriot kukland where there's all this imaginary baloney
[3:14:01.180 --> 3:14:04.060]  going on i don't talk about tuba cabras and space
[3:14:04.060 --> 3:14:08.540]  aliens you know i i i'm not i just spent five minutes with
[3:14:08.540 --> 3:14:12.060]  your pal i'm going to take these calls and each person's getting one minute
[3:14:12.060 --> 3:14:16.620]  okay because we david in thailand go ahead you're on the air
[3:14:16.620 --> 3:14:23.660]  yeah hey alex um watching the uh chris matthew's video and other things like
[3:14:23.660 --> 3:14:28.380]  it where they where they're tying the birth certificate issues things like
[3:14:28.380 --> 3:14:33.020]  nine eleven and bill berg they're saying bill berg doesn't exist and if you
[3:14:33.020 --> 3:14:35.100]  talk about it you need to go to a mental institution
[3:14:35.100 --> 3:14:37.980]  sounds like the soviet union they're saying if you question his birth
[3:14:37.980 --> 3:14:40.540]  certificate when they won't release it it's a certificate
[3:14:40.540 --> 3:14:45.580]  of a certificate it's a receipt of live birth and it looks like it's forged
[3:14:45.580 --> 3:14:49.580]  uh they're saying if you question the swine flu you're insane
[3:14:49.580 --> 3:14:54.540]  you've got to do what they say because they're losing control go ahead
[3:14:54.540 --> 3:14:58.300]  yeah this may be that's making me think that maybe
[3:14:58.300 --> 3:15:02.060]  he was actually born in hawaii but they're just
[3:15:02.060 --> 3:15:06.540]  holding that back and creating this fake controversy and tying it to all these
[3:15:06.540 --> 3:15:10.220]  other real things and then when they get ready they're gonna
[3:15:10.220 --> 3:15:13.900]  sigh up you never know the sigh up and i was thinking that the shower this morning
[3:15:13.900 --> 3:15:17.580]  after i went for a jog i'm going wait a minute they could be acting like
[3:15:17.580 --> 3:15:21.100]  you know they're upset with this to really hype it up
[3:15:21.100 --> 3:15:27.980]  and then disprove it later but if that's their body language and it's hard to
[3:15:27.980 --> 3:15:30.620]  fake it they look like they hate having to cover it
[3:15:30.620 --> 3:15:33.500]  and they're actually scared of it and let me tell you they're scared of anything
[3:15:33.500 --> 3:15:38.460]  spontaneous they're masters of hoaxes so even if it's a hoax
[3:15:38.460 --> 3:15:43.500]  that he was born in kinnia and that it's not a hoax that he was born in hawaii
[3:15:43.500 --> 3:15:46.700]  they are afraid of stuff even they're masters of lies
[3:15:46.700 --> 3:15:50.540]  so let's say it could be a lie they're scared of town halls
[3:15:50.540 --> 3:15:54.540]  spontaneously the town halls not even about obama
[3:15:54.540 --> 3:15:57.580]  and everybody's yelling and screaming about his birth certificate no they're
[3:15:57.580 --> 3:16:01.900]  genuinely scared we have to stop not accepting victory now i'm not saying
[3:16:01.900 --> 3:16:04.140]  you're bad caller i have the same thoughts this morning
[3:16:04.140 --> 3:16:07.900]  i'm always analyzing and thinking every waking moment even when i dream i'm
[3:16:07.900 --> 3:16:13.340]  thinking about this stuff but no i genuinely think they tried to
[3:16:13.340 --> 3:16:16.220]  ignore it and they're scared and that makes me think it's probably true
[3:16:16.220 --> 3:16:19.900]  and there's a lot of pieces that go into that but regardless it isn't good for
[3:16:19.900 --> 3:16:24.300]  obama and anything that stalls him is good but if it isn't true that he was
[3:16:24.300 --> 3:16:27.100]  born in kinnia i will try to come out and expose that
[3:16:27.100 --> 3:16:30.060]  but my gut tells me that they're covering something up
[3:16:30.060 --> 3:16:37.500]  and i'm not sure what it is but it's a very very serious big issue
[3:16:37.500 --> 3:16:40.940]  but after obama is defeated as a political demagogue
[3:16:40.940 --> 3:16:44.220]  as long as that train stalls and he can't get his agenda through
[3:16:44.220 --> 3:16:47.740]  then we've got to point out he's just a puppet and not make it about a new
[3:16:47.740 --> 3:16:52.220]  system where judo where they use our action against him to put a new right
[3:16:52.220 --> 3:16:56.780]  wing puppet in you see we got to stop that left right
[3:16:56.780 --> 3:17:00.780]  dynamo you understand the point i'm making
[3:17:00.780 --> 3:17:05.260]  yeah i just think of you know if they if he actually was and then they when they
[3:17:05.260 --> 3:17:08.300]  got ready they brought that out and showed that it was true
[3:17:08.300 --> 3:17:13.100]  it would discredit all the other nine eleven in the fed and build a bird that
[3:17:13.100 --> 3:17:16.620]  they've been tying that to and all the people have been talking about it would
[3:17:16.620 --> 3:17:20.060]  be all discredited you know see sir but we can hypothetically think of anything
[3:17:20.060 --> 3:17:25.260]  all day the system and i appreciate your call is discredited
[3:17:25.260 --> 3:17:29.180]  the system is discredited that's what i mean
[3:17:29.180 --> 3:17:32.620]  he may have been born in hawaii but everybody knows the government the
[3:17:32.620 --> 3:17:35.740]  media been caught lying a billion times so
[3:17:35.740 --> 3:17:41.260]  if they said opama was uh was black people wouldn't believe it
[3:17:41.260 --> 3:17:44.700]  of course because that's a lot too he's really six point five percent black
[3:17:44.700 --> 3:17:48.940]  african uh you know most of its Arab or white
[3:17:48.940 --> 3:17:53.180]  that's what i'm saying it's just it's a total confidence loss is what's
[3:17:53.180 --> 3:17:58.140]  happening uh it's very sophisticated what they've
[3:17:58.140 --> 3:18:01.660]  done and they've just basically just destroyed confidence

[3:26:17.980 --> 3:26:22.140]  with foreign troops that intellectually and historically
[3:26:22.140 --> 3:26:27.500]  is off the charts very upsetting but the way they're hyping this flu that's
[3:26:27.500 --> 3:26:30.540]  super weak that's clearly man-made though
[3:26:30.540 --> 3:26:34.220]  and dig in the mass graves and getting ready i said that back in march even
[3:26:34.220 --> 3:26:36.540]  before april and now they're saying get ready for forced
[3:26:36.540 --> 3:26:41.100]  inoculations and setting up emergency tents and troops even in austin it can't
[3:26:41.100 --> 3:26:43.980]  maybe i went over there a few days ago and confirm that
[3:26:43.980 --> 3:26:47.580]  i mean this is this they're getting ready for something big as a political
[3:26:47.580 --> 3:26:51.180]  cover for the banking takeover and the water
[3:26:51.180 --> 3:26:56.460]  takeover and the carbon tax takeover and the hate speech takeover and the
[3:26:56.460 --> 3:27:01.340]  just all of it's happening right now yes my spidey sense is off the charts
[3:27:01.340 --> 3:27:05.740]  upset okay and i mean we've all got a six
[3:27:05.740 --> 3:27:09.580]  sense but mine is intellectual and also in my gut and it's off the chart right
[3:27:09.580 --> 3:27:12.780]  now and everybody else is freaking out saying i'm worried i don't want to take
[3:27:12.780 --> 3:27:15.100]  the shot something's going on i'm worried
[3:27:15.100 --> 3:27:18.140]  and and and they're getting ready to make a move obama's approval ratings
[3:27:18.140 --> 3:27:21.660]  dropping the establishment needed him to get their agenda through
[3:27:21.660 --> 3:27:25.900]  and they're going to stage something get ready just absolutely
[3:27:25.900 --> 3:27:29.020]  as for me coming on your radio show i have never been this busy i'm behind
[3:27:29.020 --> 3:27:32.300]  doing a book i got to finish the new obama film
[3:27:32.300 --> 3:27:35.900]  that means a website and cover design and finish the film and
[3:27:35.900 --> 3:27:40.380]  it's just insane and it's so good and i'm up here every night till
[3:27:40.380 --> 3:27:44.380]  one in the morning that i really cut back on doing interviews almost down to
[3:27:44.380 --> 3:27:49.580]  nothing okay and so i will do interviews
[3:27:49.580 --> 3:27:53.420]  coming up in october folks can contact the producers that's how you do it you
[3:27:53.420 --> 3:27:57.340]  should contact them because the producer slash publicist slash
[3:27:57.340 --> 3:28:00.460]  whatever you want to call it now that was four minutes with that caller i'll
[3:28:00.460 --> 3:28:02.860]  never get anything done it's just insane
[3:28:02.860 --> 3:28:08.540]  ah let's go ahead and talk to kasey in new york go ahead kasey
[3:28:08.540 --> 3:28:12.380]  hey how's it going Alex good kasey what's on your mind today
[3:28:12.380 --> 3:28:17.020]  oh no um i've heard you mention this on several shows and i have one thing i
[3:28:17.020 --> 3:28:19.820]  disagree with you on um you said the rockefeller's
[3:28:19.820 --> 3:28:24.220]  discovered the cancer virus and for my research i found out there was an
[3:28:24.220 --> 3:28:28.220]  inventor named royal rife who discovered the cancer virus
[3:28:28.220 --> 3:28:33.420]  um using his high-end optics and actually the
[3:28:33.420 --> 3:28:37.340]  rockefeller stole those ideas from the inventor himself
[3:28:37.340 --> 3:28:41.180]  yeah i mean that's that's how many angels can dance in the head of a pin
[3:28:41.180 --> 3:28:45.260]  i've heard the recordings arrive sitting there drinking scotch
[3:28:45.260 --> 3:28:49.820]  you know claiming that he invented the sun almost and i'm not saying he probably
[3:28:49.820 --> 3:28:55.900]  didn't invent some interesting things but he also i've seen film of him with big
[3:28:55.900 --> 3:28:59.660]  so-called projectors to do stuff with flying saucers so
[3:28:59.660 --> 3:29:03.660]  i don't just accept what the government says and the media says
[3:29:03.660 --> 3:29:07.020]  and i don't accept what royal raymond writhe everybody else says
[3:29:07.020 --> 3:29:11.580]  uh i'm saying the rockefeller's foundation
[3:29:11.580 --> 3:29:15.100]  in this research i did from declassified
[3:29:15.100 --> 3:29:22.780]  university studies they in the 20s funded the research and discovered that
[3:29:22.780 --> 3:29:26.540]  most cancer was viral and then they started vaccine programs
[3:29:26.540 --> 3:29:30.780]  and cancer research and treatment facilities putting it in the vaccines
[3:29:30.780 --> 3:29:33.900]  and then they make the money off of you when you die from the cancer
[3:29:33.900 --> 3:29:37.980]  that was my point is they're killing us with cancer
[3:29:37.980 --> 3:29:41.660]  okay instead we're talking about raymond writhe and i'm not mad at you
[3:29:41.660 --> 3:29:48.620]  but my god man just just it just never ends what about not taking the shots
[3:29:48.620 --> 3:29:53.100]  that was my issue that they're giving us cancer we're on the march

[3:34:53.820 --> 3:34:56.780]  had enough of it and also we're going into a
[3:34:56.780 --> 3:34:59.260]  depression we're going into a collapse of society

[3:35:34.460 --> 3:35:38.300]  army whatever and grand legend there's just been a
[3:35:38.300 --> 3:35:42.220]  ton of activity the past week in that direction so
[3:35:42.220 --> 3:35:46.700]  well there's activity everywhere as they simulate mainly taking over cities
[3:35:46.700 --> 3:35:50.140]  as the john warner defense authorization act of 97 states
[3:35:50.140 --> 3:35:53.820]  that now homeland security and brigade homeland north com
[3:35:53.820 --> 3:35:57.180]  main job is to suppress governors and legislatures
[3:35:57.180 --> 3:36:00.780]  it's stated and then who is the legislature gonna call on
[3:36:00.780 --> 3:36:04.860]  vets number one enemy i mean if that doesn't prove the government's
[3:36:04.860 --> 3:36:07.980]  rogue and illegitimate my friend what does
[3:36:07.980 --> 3:36:13.100]  well i i agree and also just talked to a lady friend this morning whose nephew
[3:36:13.100 --> 3:36:18.620]  was just called up uh said there was a bunch of them called up
[3:36:18.620 --> 3:36:22.380]  not going to the middle east don't know what they're doing
[3:36:22.380 --> 3:36:27.420]  so those are the two two tidbits that i've got well first to go last to know
[3:36:27.420 --> 3:36:31.100]  they're admitting that they're trying to train large portions
[3:36:31.100 --> 3:36:34.140]  of the regular army force the last three years
[3:36:34.140 --> 3:36:38.620]  in mp military police search and cordon and they're doing drills from
[3:36:38.620 --> 3:36:42.620]  Missouri to california in the newspaper i showed it yesterday
[3:36:42.620 --> 3:36:47.020]  of fighting american gun owners did you see those articles i covered
[3:36:47.020 --> 3:36:53.260]  in uh... i caught a lot yesterday but uh... i didn't get everything no sir no
[3:36:53.260 --> 3:36:56.300]  no i don't blame you it's a four-hour show with a
[3:36:56.300 --> 3:36:59.580]  obnoxious pumpkin head directing it but i appreciate your call sir good to hear
[3:36:59.580 --> 3:37:04.140]  from you look again i don't have all the answers folks i'm i'm not
[3:37:04.140 --> 3:37:07.420]  the end all be all i'm just here pointing out the insanity taking place
[3:37:07.420 --> 3:37:11.900]  23.7 trills stolen they've sucked us dry they plan to fully implode the
[3:37:11.900 --> 3:37:15.580]  economy and then they're running all these
[3:37:15.580 --> 3:37:23.020]  deceptive headlines like home prices index up for first time in three years
[3:37:23.020 --> 3:37:29.020]  and then what it says is the decline slowed
[3:37:29.020 --> 3:37:35.580]  because it's bottoming out but the deceptive headline says up
[3:37:35.580 --> 3:37:39.340]  but then you read the article everything's falling apart i mean again
[3:37:39.340 --> 3:37:42.140]  they're telling you inflation's down everybody knows everything costs more
[3:37:42.140 --> 3:37:45.100]  let me ask the guys is everything costs more it seems like
[3:37:45.100 --> 3:37:48.140]  i mean do you believe the news saying things cost less
[3:37:48.140 --> 3:37:51.180]  or do they cost more
[3:37:52.780 --> 3:37:57.100]  home price index up for first time in three years index of 20 major cities
[3:37:57.100 --> 3:38:01.660]  rises on a monthly basis for the first time since July 2006
[3:38:01.660 --> 3:38:05.020]  hinting that the worst of the declines may be over
[3:38:05.020 --> 3:38:09.020]  heard green shoots six months ago remember and again i hope things will get
[3:38:09.020 --> 3:38:13.260]  better but the globalists have every intention in their own documents
[3:38:13.260 --> 3:38:17.420]  you got the dentist percentage clip where they're admitting that
[3:38:17.420 --> 3:38:21.420]  the federal reserve paid banks not to lend and that lending's gone down
[3:38:21.420 --> 3:38:23.980]  they could have paid all the mortgages in the country
[3:38:23.980 --> 3:38:30.300]  twice over and had five trillion left on a 23.7 trill
[3:38:30.300 --> 3:38:34.140]  all the mortgages 9.4 trillion all of them not the ones in trouble
[3:38:34.140 --> 3:38:37.820]  all of them every condo every mansion every
[3:38:37.820 --> 3:38:42.380]  everything go ahead and play this
[3:38:42.380 --> 3:38:46.380]  here report about lending where you talk about
[3:38:46.380 --> 3:38:52.460]  how banks have been leveraging tarp funds to support lending activities
[3:38:52.460 --> 3:38:57.100]  and you say on commercial lending 20 percent of respondents
[3:38:57.100 --> 3:39:01.740]  reported they use tarp funding for commercial lending activities
[3:39:01.740 --> 3:39:06.300]  17 percent of respondents deploying tarp funds for other consumer lending
[3:39:06.300 --> 3:39:11.420]  13 percent for small business you talk about the capital cushion
[3:39:11.420 --> 3:39:18.220]  how some banks are basically parking their funds to create a
[3:39:18.220 --> 3:39:21.580]  cushion against loan losses now i looked at your report
[3:39:21.580 --> 3:39:25.100]  and i want to use that report as a backdrop
[3:39:25.100 --> 3:39:31.660]  for a news report that came in today now we went back into the tarp history
[3:39:31.660 --> 3:39:34.300]  here we know the first intent that congress had
[3:39:34.300 --> 3:39:37.660]  purchased toxic assets which were mortgage-backed securities
[3:39:37.660 --> 3:39:41.180]  we were told to keep people in their homes well administration through that
[3:39:41.180 --> 3:39:44.060]  out the door last administration then
[3:39:44.060 --> 3:39:47.900]  we were told we're going to switch the tarp funds
[3:39:47.900 --> 3:39:52.140]  to help bail out the banks direct direct capital infusion
[3:39:52.140 --> 3:39:55.100]  but i think something else has happened here and i want to make sure it doesn't
[3:39:55.100 --> 3:39:57.740]  escape this committee and i i hope that you can
[3:39:57.740 --> 3:40:02.220]  tell me it hasn't escaped your notice we're now seeing that we have another
[3:40:02.220 --> 3:40:06.220]  switch that's occurred that we actually have the fed
[3:40:06.220 --> 3:40:11.820]  paying banks not to use their quote excess capital to make loans
[3:40:11.820 --> 3:40:14.940]  i direct your attention to news report today
[3:40:14.940 --> 3:40:19.500]  which says that banks excess reserves at the fed
[3:40:19.500 --> 3:40:26.860]  rose to a record 877.1 billion daily average in the two weeks ended may 20th
[3:40:26.860 --> 3:40:31.020]  okay that's a million dollars a year it goes on and on it's up on info wars
[3:40:31.020 --> 3:40:33.660]  dot com up on prisonplanet.com there's four more minutes
[3:40:33.660 --> 3:40:36.380]  and then you and you can give you all the mainstream news articles on there you
[3:40:36.380 --> 3:40:39.340]  can go to start page dot com a search engine and
[3:40:39.340 --> 3:40:44.380]  punch it in and find it all right there just google
[3:40:44.380 --> 3:40:47.580]  federal reserve paying banks not to loan yeah federal reserve
[3:40:47.580 --> 3:40:51.820]  paying its own banks the federal reserve is a holding front company
[3:40:51.820 --> 3:40:56.700]  for private banks now i told you this back in october
[3:40:56.700 --> 3:41:00.140]  because they've done this in the third world all over and over again
[3:41:00.140 --> 3:41:05.180]  they plunge the economy get a bailout hoard the money
[3:41:05.180 --> 3:41:09.260]  till everything implodes then they're going to dump the money on the market
[3:41:09.260 --> 3:41:12.540]  buying everything up while it still has value
[3:41:12.540 --> 3:41:17.980]  then it's devalued once the money finally gets in your hands in the economy
[3:41:17.980 --> 3:41:21.820]  because their argument is this money can only be an institutional level
[3:41:21.820 --> 3:41:24.700]  it can't hit the street or it'll cause inflation
[3:41:24.700 --> 3:41:30.940]  comprende that's why they're buying seaports and roads
[3:41:30.940 --> 3:41:35.260]  and technology companies and things like that and and weapons systems
[3:41:35.260 --> 3:41:39.980]  because you're not supposed to get your own stinking money
[3:41:39.980 --> 3:41:44.300]  and then as if that fraud wasn't enough you pay interest to the banks
[3:41:44.300 --> 3:41:49.580]  on the money you gave them my god imagine if you're a con artist and you
[3:41:49.580 --> 3:41:53.820]  thought the most insane fraud you could of how to rip the biggest idiots off
[3:41:53.820 --> 3:41:57.420]  this is it it's like new jersey where hundreds of government
[3:41:57.420 --> 3:42:01.580]  officials are selling organs and stealing money from things and
[3:42:01.580 --> 3:42:04.860]  mayors and the whole country's like this i mean i just
[3:42:04.860 --> 3:42:08.460]  i mean it's and then and then kucinich and ron paul get attacked by the
[3:42:08.460 --> 3:42:11.500]  media they're the bad guys because they're talking there
[3:42:11.500 --> 3:42:15.420]  there's the bad man right there here's the bad man
[3:42:15.420 --> 3:42:19.660]  got the news media basically parachuting in on me attacking me every day
[3:42:19.660 --> 3:42:23.420]  yeah because i don't like being raped by foreign banks okay let's blitz through
[3:42:23.420 --> 3:42:27.980]  calls ryan in wisconsin come on down
[3:42:27.980 --> 3:42:32.220]  hi alex um hey it's the hype about the united

[3:42:38.780 --> 3:42:43.740]  uh specifically i have to pull that up but a lot of that is
[3:42:43.740 --> 3:42:49.180]  true some of it isn't uh they also say things like
[3:42:49.180 --> 3:42:51.980]  you know this company or that company or this government agencies will be a
[3:42:51.980 --> 3:42:56.220]  private corporation and they operate as private corporations but they
[3:42:56.220 --> 3:43:00.220]  have one foot in government one foot out of government it's a quasi
[3:43:00.220 --> 3:43:02.860]  uh but it is through the district of columbia
[3:43:02.860 --> 3:43:07.100]  does operate as a corporation but it has feet
[3:43:07.100 --> 3:43:15.660]  in both the republic and in the country and in its own corporate system
[3:43:15.660 --> 3:43:24.300]  does that answer your question if there's two government
[3:43:24.300 --> 3:43:27.580]  well there's more than two governments i mean you now have the private
[3:43:27.580 --> 3:43:31.660]  bureaucracies that openly tie into private corporations that are now
[3:43:31.660 --> 3:43:35.580]  the real government and they operate under continuity of government laws
[3:43:35.580 --> 3:43:39.340]  uh and through the national security council i appreciate your call

[3:48:52.220 --> 3:48:55.420]  but because it's black and white they said well
