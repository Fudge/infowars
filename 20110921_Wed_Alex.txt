[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:30.500]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.500 --> 00:37.140]  it is Wednesday the 21st day of September 2011 we're gonna be live here for
[00:37.140 --> 00:42.900]  the next three hours then I'll be back of course tonight 7 o'clock with info
[00:42.900 --> 00:47.340]  wars nightly news dr. Andrew Wakefield will be in studio with us we covered
[00:47.340 --> 00:52.780]  Gardasil some last night but tonight is going to be the big special report giving
[00:52.780 --> 00:58.060]  you the full spectrum on exactly what is behind this autoimmune disease causing
[00:58.060 --> 01:04.060]  bioweapon so we're gonna be breaking that down coming up tonight 7 o'clock I'm
[01:04.060 --> 01:08.580]  also gonna be going over to some today some of the huge developments on that
[01:08.580 --> 01:12.420]  front of course this article went up yesterday I covered it quite a bit but
[01:12.420 --> 01:17.940]  we need to get back into it today vaccine lobby launches Gardasil safety hoax
[01:17.940 --> 01:23.100]  that of course dovetails with billions spent on a cure for cancer yet cancer
[01:23.100 --> 01:28.060]  rates continue to explode the UN said it's set to double again in the next
[01:28.060 --> 01:34.900]  decade and a half this is a giant biological warfare program of the
[01:34.900 --> 01:38.940]  eugenicist against free humanity also federal government recently paid out
[01:38.940 --> 01:43.980]  vaccine autism compensation to 83 families in their own internal documents
[01:43.980 --> 01:48.580]  admit a clear link with autoimmune disorders causing brain inflammation and
[01:48.580 --> 01:52.940]  brain damage in children turns out there's of course internal US and
[01:52.940 --> 01:57.660]  British government reports that predate Andrew Wakefield finding the exact same
[01:57.660 --> 02:01.380]  findings he found they ran the hoax in the last year saying he's been
[02:01.380 --> 02:06.860]  completely discredited and as a liar and it turned out people in the employee
[02:06.860 --> 02:12.940]  the vaccine companies put out this line just like the Merck connected eugenicist
[02:12.940 --> 02:17.740]  have recently come out and said not one single person's ever been hurt by
[02:17.740 --> 02:25.100]  Gardasil when the CDC with only 2% of adverse reactions being reported 2%
[02:25.100 --> 02:32.060]  out of a hundred 2 out of a hundred reports 18,600 plus adverse
[02:32.060 --> 02:38.300]  reactions including death from Gardasil but they come out on every news show in
[02:38.300 --> 02:45.220]  the last week every new CNN Fox ABC meet the prostitutes all of them layer
[02:45.220 --> 02:53.260]  news hour and say nobody's ever been hurt by this hard core savage lying and
[02:53.260 --> 02:58.860]  deception I was thinking this morning and it really hit me as an epiphany I
[02:58.860 --> 03:02.980]  know I've said it many times but just how true it is that the globalist are
[03:02.980 --> 03:08.100]  waging war against reality they are waging war against the natural world
[03:08.100 --> 03:13.060]  they are waging war against common sense because the only way corruption and
[03:13.060 --> 03:19.020]  avarice and psychopathic behavior and operate and continue is if the general
[03:19.020 --> 03:25.220]  public is put into a completely delusional state all of the craziness you
[03:25.220 --> 03:31.860]  see all of the over-the-topness you see is meant to be over the top no one's
[03:31.860 --> 03:36.860]  ever been hurt by Gardasil I'm wearing a white lab coat I'm on I'm on TV it's
[03:36.860 --> 03:41.140]  just ridiculous that people say there's a problem when there are hundreds of
[03:41.140 --> 03:45.100]  newscasts on all the deaths and autoimmune disorders and then you find
[03:45.100 --> 03:50.700]  out sure enough 13 different sub manufacturers of the Gardasil and a big
[03:50.700 --> 03:54.460]  study and test that was put out last week by a private big vaccine research lab
[03:54.460 --> 03:59.980]  all of them by accident just like the UN got caught binding tetanus pathogen to
[03:59.980 --> 04:03.340]  the female hormone that's secreted in second trimester and possible to bring
[04:03.340 --> 04:07.940]  a baby to term so it's a soft kill weapon on the mother damages the mother
[04:07.940 --> 04:14.740]  greatly and kills the baby causes a second trimester onset loss of the
[04:14.740 --> 04:20.060]  baby it would be a miscarriage but it's a chemical warfare abortion slash
[04:20.060 --> 04:24.660]  biological warfare abortion just so happens over a hundred manufacturers
[04:24.660 --> 04:29.820]  with that case by the UN all accidentally added the expensive synthetic
[04:29.820 --> 04:33.980]  hormone and it just so happens Gardasil just accidentally had the whole virus
[04:33.980 --> 04:38.580]  and just accidentally connected it to the adjuvant aluminum in 13
[04:38.580 --> 04:48.540]  manufacturers complete accident of course in autoimmune weapon just like that
[04:48.540 --> 04:55.340]  little nasty goodie they had called HIV that's a Pentagon Navy weapon developed
[04:55.340 --> 05:01.700]  in 1974 I'll be right back stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good
[05:01.700 --> 05:05.700]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new

[05:09.500 --> 05:13.860]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[05:13.860 --> 05:18.220]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[05:18.220 --> 05:22.680]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[05:22.680 --> 05:27.420]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.420 --> 05:31.220]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.220 --> 05:34.820]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.820 --> 05:39.180]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.180 --> 05:42.340]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[08:57.700 --> 09:03.300]  open phones during that time period and talk about 9-11 10 years later more
[09:03.300 --> 09:08.580]  police state more loss of liberty no discussion of the growth of the security
[09:08.580 --> 09:17.100]  police state secret police apparatus ever receding contrary to that only rapidly
[09:17.100 --> 09:25.300]  expanding while basic police services that you actually need are being curtailed
[09:25.580 --> 09:31.900]  more violence across the border with Mexico in one case 30-plus bodies dumped
[09:31.900 --> 09:36.260]  out dead on the road but that's just a minor footnote in the back of the paper
[09:36.260 --> 09:41.580]  no now the TSA is announcing they want to run their fingers through your hair
[09:41.580 --> 09:45.100]  they've been doing it for a while but now they're saying everyone will have to
[09:45.100 --> 09:49.460]  be intimately touched it's all about breaking your will getting through your
[09:49.460 --> 09:52.780]  comfort zone ahead of forced inoculations they've got to train
[09:52.780 --> 09:58.300]  cadres of bureaucrats to put their hands on you at the NFL or the school
[09:58.300 --> 10:03.740]  prom all federally knighted to be able to violate the Fourth Amendment outside
[10:03.740 --> 10:07.620]  of law we also have big developments on the
[10:07.620 --> 10:12.420]  forced inoculation Gardasil front we're going to be going over today big news on
[10:12.420 --> 10:18.900]  the Fukushima front more and more Democrats are telling Obama I saw more
[10:18.900 --> 10:23.740]  than 10 articles yesterday Washington Post Washington Times Chicago Tribune
[10:23.740 --> 10:29.260]  on and on and on saying step down Obama don't run for reelection what does that
[10:29.260 --> 10:34.500]  signify you know we predicted that would happen in the Obama deception anything
[10:34.500 --> 10:38.140]  built up this big was destined to be destroyed because we knew they were
[10:38.140 --> 10:43.020]  planning to fully implode the economy in the four years of Obama they've got to
[10:43.020 --> 10:47.620]  blame everything on him so that people climb the gates at the White House
[10:47.620 --> 10:52.020]  wanting to get near the most powerful man in the world and so the media focuses
[10:52.020 --> 10:56.620]  on him and the next puppet that's coming never on the actual puppet masters
[10:56.620 --> 11:00.740]  there's one candidate who actually talks about the puppet masters and
[11:00.740 --> 11:04.260]  actually talks about the global government that's now revealing itself
[11:04.260 --> 11:09.220]  and coming out in the open to fix the crisis it's engineered if you just give
[11:09.220 --> 11:13.540]  up all your liberties to it and that's Ron Paul that's why he's being demonized
[11:13.540 --> 11:18.700]  she be asked in a big report all Watson's got an article out at info wars
[11:18.700 --> 11:23.940]  calm and prison planet calm day on it the new establishment dirty trick against
[11:23.940 --> 11:29.060]  Ron Paul is the headline he's an elitist yes in one day he was going to
[11:29.060 --> 11:35.260]  give three campaign stops and so they rented the top tier candidate a private
[11:35.260 --> 11:40.500]  jet something that I know a local lighting company does because if they're
[11:40.500 --> 11:45.300]  going to be going to a big conference why should they put their 15 employees on
[11:45.300 --> 11:51.140]  a regular jet airplane when for a lesser amount they can rent a private jet same
[11:51.140 --> 11:57.220]  thing with Ron Paul in his whole campaign of course he saved money and was
[11:57.220 --> 12:01.540]  able to go to campaign fundraisers and raise more money because he could fly
[12:01.540 --> 12:07.180]  to three places this is the establishment manipulating people this is
[12:07.180 --> 12:15.180]  the establishment playing games the new smear Ron Paul is an elitist you know I've
[12:15.180 --> 12:19.340]  told the Paul campaign privately why are you letting him fly commercial when it
[12:19.340 --> 12:25.100]  takes much longer you need to to to get a private jet if I got talked to some of
[12:25.100 --> 12:29.780]  the campaign folks and found out they've got as many as 10 to 15 campaign people
[12:29.780 --> 12:35.100]  flying commercial with Ron Paul getting stuck in airports with a top tier
[12:35.100 --> 12:39.340]  presidential candidate and he's being groped as he told you about here on air
[12:39.340 --> 12:44.260]  a few interviews ago what do you call it just disgusting and I said do they grab
[12:44.260 --> 12:50.140]  your crotch he said yes it's horrible it's disgusting and so now less money
[12:50.140 --> 12:55.580]  faster and they're calling it a major controversy next they're going to say
[12:55.580 --> 13:01.420]  that one time he had a chipped toenail and you know they're digging through
[13:01.420 --> 13:04.580]  everything on him they're going to probably say he was never a medical
[13:04.580 --> 13:08.180]  doctor that he's probably not born in America that he killed JFK that he
[13:08.180 --> 13:14.420]  crucified Christ that he sunk the Titanic the Lusitania and the USS Liberty and
[13:14.420 --> 13:19.980]  the main and that yes Ron Paul if your eggs aren't cooked right in the morning
[13:19.980 --> 13:25.780]  he is a little little goblin elf that runs out and turns down the fire to trick
[13:25.780 --> 13:29.620]  you like Loki to make sure the eggs aren't cooked properly if you fall
[13:29.620 --> 13:35.780]  walking down icy steps Ron Paul did it if there's any economic problems now I'm
[13:35.780 --> 13:39.860]  being serious Ron Paul's fault for criticizing the economy and and the
[13:39.860 --> 13:46.460]  criminal government alright I'm now digressing I'm now digressing you know
[13:46.460 --> 13:49.580]  I sat in here this morning going over more than a hundred news articles each
[13:49.580 --> 13:54.260]  one of them absolutely off the chart incredible and instead I'm just
[13:54.260 --> 13:59.860]  perseverating off into the doldrums here let me let me do this I'm gonna I'm
[13:59.860 --> 14:04.780]  gonna give the number out in this first hour into the second hour for first time
[14:04.780 --> 14:08.140]  callers I do this at least once a week I want you to be able to have a chance to
[14:08.140 --> 14:12.780]  get involved on air a toll-free number on any issue any news item anything I
[14:12.780 --> 14:18.340]  bring up anything you want to bring up any question any comment is 800 25 at
[14:18.340 --> 14:28.780]  992 31 800 25 at 992 31 now let me just do this let me just
[14:28.780 --> 14:34.700]  let me just go over the headlines themselves now now again I can never get
[14:34.700 --> 14:37.940]  more than four or five stories and without commenting and digressing and
[14:37.940 --> 14:41.020]  spending an hour on the net on the story that I finally stop on but let's just
[14:41.020 --> 14:45.580]  see if I can read these headlines and then professionally go back through each
[14:45.580 --> 14:51.980]  one with a little bit of comment and analysis TSA officer sentence for theft
[14:51.980 --> 14:58.300]  from passengers this is CNN by the way this is just today oh I guess I only got
[14:58.300 --> 15:02.780]  to one this is just today that I had all these articles just from today
[15:02.780 --> 15:08.380]  reportedly robbed a whole bunch of people had to pay restitution on the one
[15:08.380 --> 15:14.340]  person they got caught robbing for tens of thousands of dollars and they've got
[15:14.340 --> 15:21.300]  a few months at home on house arrest I mean normally when you're entrusted with
[15:21.300 --> 15:26.740]  a oath and everything or say I guess they don't give oaths then you get more
[15:26.740 --> 15:31.060]  trouble for official crime but no a transportation security administration
[15:31.060 --> 15:35.460]  officer they're not really officers who pled guilty in February the federal
[15:35.460 --> 15:38.580]  charges that he stole from passengers during screenings at Newark Liberty
[15:38.580 --> 15:42.820]  International Airport I've been through that a bunch well sentence Tuesday the
[15:42.820 --> 15:49.060]  six months of home confinement US Attorney Paul J. Fishman announced and so
[15:49.060 --> 15:53.420]  that's it and I guess he gets to keep most of what he took he just has to pay
[15:53.420 --> 15:57.700]  restitution on the one case he got caught with so a paid vacation
[15:57.700 --> 16:04.020]  continuing here TSA official not a servant but an official charged in
[16:04.020 --> 16:10.220]  slaying of worker I wonder if they'll get six months in a who's scale for that
[16:10.220 --> 16:15.140]  or maybe on home detention here's another one TSA agent charged with rape
[16:15.140 --> 16:21.860]  that's news channel five oh there's more this is just today TSA searches Dallas
[16:21.860 --> 16:26.820]  woman's hair her weapons and they say yes the policy is they want to run their
[16:26.820 --> 16:30.620]  hands through your hair and I see it with women particularly they they grab
[16:30.620 --> 16:33.860]  their breasts grab their genitals and then you watch men and women just run
[16:33.860 --> 16:38.060]  their hands oh let me I even see it with men oh yes you've got even a short hair
[16:38.060 --> 16:42.860]  cut let me let me feel your face all your lips oh yeah that's been described
[16:42.860 --> 16:48.340]  and men searching the female babies even I guess they've got now TV shows where
[16:48.340 --> 16:52.980]  toddlers dress up with fake breasts for pedophiles on TV so I guess they're
[16:52.980 --> 16:58.220]  gonna have fetus television next live fetuses out there through an x-ray with
[16:58.220 --> 17:04.340]  the mom up there walking they'll try to superimpose sexual organs onto a fetus
[17:04.340 --> 17:09.260]  it's all part of the complete collapse of society evil running rampant right as
[17:09.260 --> 17:13.140]  the country begins to go completely belly up and as the giant FEMA centers
[17:13.140 --> 17:19.580]  are announced so there you have it
[17:20.020 --> 17:27.660]  continuing but none of that matters again they're keeping us safe from the
[17:27.660 --> 17:31.180]  non-existent cases where the government itself admits that they get
[17:31.180 --> 17:36.540]  underwear bombers and shoe bombers on the aircraft run by the same Pentagon
[17:36.540 --> 17:40.460]  operative and we're all lucky by the way I had Kurt Haskell on the TV show
[17:40.460 --> 17:45.820]  yesterday in Full Wars Nightly News and he said Alex I'm basically getting ready
[17:45.820 --> 17:49.500]  to leave the country and there's no hope for it because he's been going to the
[17:49.500 --> 17:54.860]  trial of Mutalib and Mutalib his own lawyers that he's basically recused who
[17:54.860 --> 17:58.140]  are now on standby have seen the evidence and the government's been
[17:58.140 --> 18:01.900]  withholding it but they've gotten part of it and they now believe that and the
[18:01.900 --> 18:07.220]  defense if they were allowed to put it on is entrapment and set up and that the
[18:07.220 --> 18:11.020]  government got him on the plane which is admitted even on C-SPAN in a
[18:11.020 --> 18:16.580]  transportation committee hearings with Mr. Kennedy the undersecretary of a
[18:16.580 --> 18:19.300]  state admitting that they were ordered to get him on the aircraft and now
[18:19.300 --> 18:23.700]  Haskell is trying to get the document where it was a US government
[18:23.700 --> 18:29.780]  international profiler who got him on the aircraft and even when that comes out
[18:29.780 --> 18:34.620]  nothing's gonna happen in Kurt's view I understand how desperate he is just like
[18:34.620 --> 18:38.940]  it's now admitted it was released yesterday that the audio tapes and it's
[18:38.940 --> 18:42.580]  such old news here we didn't even play him where the ATF is talking about how
[18:42.580 --> 18:45.140]  they're gonna blame the guns on the Second Amendment and how they're
[18:45.140 --> 18:51.420]  criminally covering up and of course it's back in the El Paso times out of
[18:51.420 --> 18:55.260]  federal court that indeed the government has said that yes the Sena Loa
[18:55.260 --> 18:58.940]  Crime Boss does work for them and should be given immunity and that indeed
[18:58.940 --> 19:02.740]  the fact that the Mexicans arrested him and shipped him up here he needs to go
[19:02.740 --> 19:08.580]  ahead and be released some of the feds were saying keep him in jail but now
[19:08.580 --> 19:13.060]  they're saying no just releasing and tens of tons of pure cocaine shipped in
[19:13.060 --> 19:19.780]  guns down there to blame the Second Amendment and then there's another
[19:19.780 --> 19:28.340]  report TSA agent charged with statutory rape I guess Drudge is linked to info
[19:28.340 --> 19:36.900]  wars report on that oh yeah Kurt Nemo did a story on that so that's up at
[19:36.900 --> 19:44.900]  drudgerport.com again I don't have words to describe how evil this this
[19:44.900 --> 19:52.540]  interlocking mafia is that took over our government but not worried about the

[25:50.580 --> 25:55.140]  yesterday was just saying he's giving up basically and the country needs to be
[25:55.140 --> 25:59.220]  evacuated and I explained to him well obviously Kurt you're not giving up
[25:59.220 --> 26:04.140]  because you're still here fighting and I understand when it hits rock bottom and
[26:04.140 --> 26:09.060]  you realize just how criminal the system is and how conscious they are of their
[26:09.060 --> 26:13.460]  criminality that you got one group of people in government that are absolute
[26:13.460 --> 26:17.700]  ruthless gangsters who enjoy hurting innocent people and then you've got a
[26:17.700 --> 26:22.420]  bunch of cowards who know their bosses are criminals who go along to get along
[26:22.420 --> 26:27.020]  and then you got other Dudley do right compartmentalized idiots who are not
[26:27.020 --> 26:33.580]  even aware of what's going on and happening who are not even aware of
[26:33.580 --> 26:40.060]  what's happening they have no idea and and the general public thinks their
[26:40.060 --> 26:44.220]  rights and their freedoms are about what color they are what sexual preference
[26:44.220 --> 26:48.620]  they are and people obsess on that all day meanwhile all of us are having
[26:48.620 --> 26:52.780]  chemical and biological and radiological agents put in our food and water on record
[26:52.780 --> 26:57.540]  and we've documented it the cancer rates doubled world health organizations out
[26:57.540 --> 27:02.180]  today saying it's gonna double again in the next 15 years they're murdering us
[27:02.180 --> 27:07.260]  openly out in the open and you can't even get the general drooling public to
[27:07.260 --> 27:10.820]  realize the attack that they're under
[27:12.700 --> 27:17.260]  and it's very very frustrating and I understand why new listeners just say
[27:17.260 --> 27:20.540]  this guy's a nut you don't want to go read the Rockefeller Foundation
[27:20.540 --> 27:25.060]  documents 1966 that I'm gonna show tonight on the TV show that we wrote
[27:25.060 --> 27:28.300]  about years ago and posted on the website where they said we're gonna
[27:28.300 --> 27:33.740]  develop vaccines that claim there for one years but really have a sterilant you
[27:33.740 --> 27:36.380]  don't want to see the government documents about cancer viruses and
[27:36.380 --> 27:39.740]  vaccines how they killed your mama your daddy your grandma almost everybody in
[27:39.740 --> 27:44.820]  your family you don't want to hear that you don't want to hear that because
[27:44.820 --> 27:48.940]  you'd have to do something about these murderers if you went and found out it
[27:48.940 --> 27:53.780]  was true and then you know what it'd be really scary to realize they got nuclear
[27:53.780 --> 27:57.180]  weapons they got the military and they got the police and they've gone out and
[27:57.180 --> 28:02.100]  psychologically tested and found people to fill the police departments who do
[28:02.100 --> 28:06.780]  not care who only want to wear that uniform and we'll roll their sleeve up
[28:06.780 --> 28:10.180]  and say give me a shot of cancer right now as long as I can go out there and
[28:10.180 --> 28:16.420]  feed my ego on people and raise some revenue to bring this country down that's
[28:16.420 --> 28:21.860]  the type of people just low-grade moron nobodies who are gonna sit there and
[28:21.860 --> 28:26.300]  bring this country down for the parasites
[28:31.180 --> 28:37.780]  you know sometimes it's not a good thing when I take a few days off because I am

[28:55.900 --> 28:59.420]  and his wife with the underwear bomber and he saw the US government agent get
[28:59.420 --> 29:03.340]  him on the plane everything he tried to bring to the FBI he tried to warn people
[29:03.340 --> 29:07.060]  later the government admitted it was all true but they don't care nobody gets
[29:07.060 --> 29:10.780]  in trouble they just go forward just like the guns in New Mexico more news

[33:30.740 --> 33:34.700]  others those that survived they didn't track down and kill about the ATF being
[33:34.700 --> 33:39.940]  involved in it they have now said it might be a car bomb in Michigan if it
[33:39.940 --> 33:43.220]  gets any attention it's either a provocateur or purely staged event
[33:43.220 --> 33:48.220]  there are car bombs and truck bombs all the time in the southwest as far north
[33:48.220 --> 33:54.460]  as Dallas and it literally gets a back of the newspaper blurb when it's a
[33:54.460 --> 33:59.980]  Mexican cartel car bombing or truck bombing generally it's murdering
[33:59.980 --> 34:03.820]  whoever's in the car more of an assassination type car bomb or truck
[34:03.820 --> 34:08.900]  bomb not an offensive one meant to damage a nearby building so not an
[34:08.900 --> 34:13.140]  asymmetrical warfare but an assassination bombing but we'll continue to track
[34:13.140 --> 34:21.260]  this and give you news on it as it unfolds continuing here with the news I
[34:21.260 --> 34:28.740]  knew this I don't know 12 years ago or so when on star came out because I was
[34:28.740 --> 34:37.260]  sent internal memos from within General Motors pointing out that in the future
[34:37.260 --> 34:43.380]  they would use the system to listen to people without warrants and sell the
[34:43.380 --> 34:48.500]  data a few years after that of course people said that's ridiculous we're not
[34:48.500 --> 34:52.140]  in a police state they would get in trouble for that years after that it
[34:52.140 --> 34:58.140]  came out the FBI was using on star without warrants to listen to people all
[34:58.140 --> 35:05.300]  it is as a cell phone system under federal regulation since 1996 it is law
[35:05.300 --> 35:10.340]  that all cell phones be triangulated down to 15 feet via GPS on the cell
[35:10.340 --> 35:15.900]  towers not on the cell phone on the cell towers it triangulates and that all
[35:15.900 --> 35:21.500]  cell phones even when off be able to be remotely activated to appear there off
[35:21.500 --> 35:27.300]  and that you be listened to over the systems when I was at Bilderberg all of
[35:27.300 --> 35:31.820]  our cell phones no matter how much we charged them would run down within about
[35:31.820 --> 35:36.580]  30 minutes and that's because they were being continually used as tracker
[35:36.580 --> 35:41.460]  devices and as audio devices then I actually walked into a room there at
[35:41.460 --> 35:46.260]  the hotel as they were throwing a sound with men in suits sitting around the
[35:46.260 --> 35:50.140]  table listening to everyone and talking about everyone they were listening to
[35:50.140 --> 35:54.740]  in and around the hotel I told the story I'm sitting there getting Gatorade
[35:54.740 --> 35:57.420]  it's in the gift shop they've got the whole back office full and every other
[35:57.420 --> 36:02.500]  major office around the building just hundreds of spooks walking around and I
[36:02.500 --> 36:06.420]  hear I'm going no no no that's not how you dial in an Air Force satellite you
[36:06.420 --> 36:11.060]  dial it through no it's a Navy SMQ 7 scrambler I told you there you got them
[36:11.060 --> 36:14.620]  you got them all right they're about to arrive we've got them okay all right
[36:14.620 --> 36:18.140]  patch into that we've got people moving in this area of the hotel and all the
[36:18.140 --> 36:23.940]  sudden I'm looking in and they get up and slam the door I wish I had a video
[36:23.940 --> 36:26.780]  camera on me I did have one of those little fake sticks a gum that shoot
[36:26.780 --> 36:31.060]  video but those things work once when you first buy them if you're lucky it's
[36:31.060 --> 36:35.380]  like a fake stick of gum that we had in the technology is just gets better and
[36:35.380 --> 36:38.820]  better a fake wriggly spearmint gum package that shoots horrible blurry
[36:38.820 --> 36:48.020]  video and takes little photos but the point is is that we covered all of this
[36:48.020 --> 36:56.540]  and we went on and on and on and on at nauseam breaking it all down and then
[36:56.540 --> 37:00.540]  of course they had articles in USA today saying that when you order a pizza from
[37:00.540 --> 37:04.140]  any of the big companies they run a background check on you and they get
[37:04.140 --> 37:08.620]  25% of the fines and fees of there is a warrant a lot of times it just
[37:08.620 --> 37:12.220]  categorizes for cops where you're really living if they want to arrest you later
[37:12.220 --> 37:19.180]  or if you're a high value target they send in the police right away so really
[37:19.180 --> 37:27.900]  none of this is a surprise but here it is on star begins spying on customers GPS
[37:27.900 --> 37:33.340]  location for profit and this this blogger of course has an article about it in a
[37:33.340 --> 37:37.700]  copy of it of the email and I went and did some looking this morning and sure
[37:37.700 --> 37:44.340]  enough people been sent these they're now announcing to you that yes we share
[37:44.340 --> 37:50.340]  the data with law enforcement yes we're tracking you yes we sell it and what did
[37:50.340 --> 37:59.780]  the head of the what did the head of and the founder of Facebook say last year
[37:59.780 --> 38:03.900]  he said of course we track and sell everything our users do and these dumb
[38:03.900 --> 38:13.220]  bleepers trust us on star begins spying on customers GPS location for profit I
[38:13.220 --> 38:18.020]  cancel the on start subscription of my new GMC vehicle today after receiving an
[38:18.020 --> 38:22.940]  email from the company about their new terms and conditions all most people I
[38:22.940 --> 38:27.980]  imagine would get the delete button when receiving something as exciting as new
[38:27.980 --> 38:32.940]  terms and conditions being the nerds sort I decided to have a personal
[38:32.940 --> 38:39.020]  drooling session and read it instead I'm glad I did on stars latest TNC has some
[38:39.020 --> 38:42.500]  very unsettling updates in it which include the ability to sell your personal
[38:42.500 --> 38:46.940]  GPS location information speed safety belt usage to the insurance company
[38:46.940 --> 38:51.980]  folks and other information in third parties including law enforcement that
[38:51.980 --> 38:56.660]  insult to a slap in the face this has always been the case the company insists
[38:56.660 --> 39:02.220]  they will continue collecting and selling the personal information even after you
[39:02.220 --> 39:05.460]  cancel your service unless you specifically shut down the data
[39:05.460 --> 39:10.100]  connection to the vehicle after canceling yeah you've got to go in have them
[39:10.100 --> 39:16.100]  pull out the dash and I bought a Chevy Tahoe like a decade ago and even though I
[39:16.100 --> 39:24.740]  bought it from a family friend out there at was it covert country in Bastrop was
[39:24.740 --> 39:28.260]  Roger Raceler the little brother of the Raceler brothers former UT football
[39:28.260 --> 39:32.580]  player friend of mine from high school and I was out there and then when I told
[39:32.580 --> 39:36.620]  him I want people to go in there and unhooked that it was all a big joke and
[39:36.620 --> 39:39.860]  everything oh come on Alex we know your Mr. Conspiracy and I just said look
[39:39.860 --> 39:44.700]  I'm not buying this till I see you open that dash up and unplug the
[39:44.700 --> 39:52.380]  cell phone and they did it but still there were shaking of heads and this
[39:52.380 --> 39:59.060]  guy's crazy see there's a disrespect for people that are informed there's it
[39:59.060 --> 40:02.540]  people think if they just laugh at something that Alex Jones says that
[40:02.540 --> 40:07.300]  71% of the country's water supplies the federal government's adding a cocktail
[40:07.300 --> 40:11.860]  of radioactive isotopes in the so-called fluoride solution now if you're a
[40:11.860 --> 40:16.580]  mother a father and you hear that or even if you just care about yourself you
[40:16.580 --> 40:21.260]  would go just do a search and find out that's true we've given you the articles
[40:21.260 --> 40:26.020]  the chapter and verse the whole nine yards by the way tomorrow we're going to
[40:26.020 --> 40:32.340]  release hidden video from inside the Austin water works our people got a
[40:32.340 --> 40:36.260]  tour a few years ago but they were freaked out and said do not tape anything
[40:36.260 --> 40:40.460]  well it's public I pay for it and they don't want you seeing the big bags of
[40:40.460 --> 40:44.060]  fluoride they got skull and crossbones on it or spots where the fluoride dripped
[40:44.060 --> 40:46.820]  out and eight holes in the ground we're gonna go ahead and release that tomorrow
[40:46.820 --> 40:54.860]  on the nightly news you see a normal person finds out they're putting uranium
[40:56.460 --> 41:01.700]  and other radioactive isotopes in your water you might want to know about that
[41:01.700 --> 41:07.100]  but hey a lot of you think a doubling in cancer in the last decade is fun and the
[41:07.100 --> 41:11.580]  World Health Organization saying we're on track for another doubling but that's
[41:11.580 --> 41:15.700]  in my stack today that's why I'm angry I'm a little upset about a bunch of
[41:15.700 --> 41:19.100]  criminal bankers who think they're God they've taken the world over through
[41:19.100 --> 41:25.300]  fraud spiking my water and I got to go through all sorts of bat bending back
[41:25.300 --> 41:30.500]  flips and move out to the country to get away from you people and still your
[41:30.500 --> 41:35.580]  GMO cross splicing the food it's jumping into all the other non GMO crops so no
[41:35.580 --> 41:40.020]  matter what I do it's real funny that within three generations all mammal
[41:40.020 --> 41:44.380]  species fed this become almost completely sterile and have all sorts of
[41:44.380 --> 41:49.340]  mutagenic effects where the babies are born all mutated or retarded and it's
[41:49.340 --> 41:53.220]  real funny in the aspartame can't buy gum at the store that doesn't have it
[41:53.220 --> 41:58.780]  it's all real funny that almost all the baby monkeys that were fed at the trials
[41:58.780 --> 42:04.260]  in the 70s died in their mother's milk added aspartame and they died and so your
[42:04.260 --> 42:07.960]  answer is to put it in everything and I got big articles here about all these
[42:07.960 --> 42:11.580]  women having babies that are born and then die suddenly and it's linked to the
[42:11.580 --> 42:15.580]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are a deadly chemical weapon and causes when
[42:15.580 --> 42:18.740]  they tell women when they're pregnant take antidepressants when even in the
[42:18.740 --> 42:24.660]  trials 30 something years ago hard to believe it's 30 years ago of Eli Lilly's
[42:24.660 --> 42:30.180]  drug massive increases in suicide everything else and of course causing
[42:30.180 --> 42:33.940]  areas of the brain to not develop in the children so you just give birth to a
[42:33.940 --> 42:39.780]  zombie oh that's real fun man this is a nice group of people and I'm supposed to
[42:39.780 --> 42:44.580]  just sit here and like it and take it and put up with it and just watch
[42:44.580 --> 42:50.580]  driving back from Arkansas I saw cops every five miles and now they're finally
[42:50.580 --> 42:54.100]  doing something that makes sense they come up on the passenger side now instead
[42:54.100 --> 42:56.380]  of hanging their butts out in the middle of the highway to make the government a
[42:56.380 --> 42:59.980]  dime they tell these cops you got to increase the revenue we're going bankrupt
[42:59.980 --> 43:04.060]  to keep your job you'll never keep your pension no amount of money you could
[43:04.060 --> 43:07.460]  raise will ever pay for it it's all a fraud it all goes to the foreign offshore
[43:07.460 --> 43:11.780]  banks your local town your city your state in hoc to them through fraud and I
[43:11.780 --> 43:16.220]  see the cops eye seething on power trips and the way they approach cars I
[43:16.220 --> 43:22.980]  probably saw 50 cop cars from little rock Arkansas not little rock I was close
[43:22.980 --> 43:27.140]  a little rock from from hot springs Arkansas down to Austin Texas I probably
[43:27.140 --> 43:31.060]  saw more than 50 and I'd watch their body language as they approach cars all
[43:31.060 --> 43:37.100]  scared to death and this weird little pity party cult they're in of how
[43:37.100 --> 43:42.620]  they're all in danger and oh my gosh the public wants to get you and everything
[43:42.620 --> 43:48.900]  meanwhile your food your water is all being spiked it's all being manipulated
[43:48.900 --> 43:52.060]  we're being sprayed with chemtrails there was big articles last week oh the
[43:52.060 --> 43:55.300]  government is going to start massive geoengineering they've been doing tests
[43:55.300 --> 43:59.540]  for years spraying barium aluminum dioxide and other salts into the air
[43:59.540 --> 44:07.180]  it's highly toxic to humans and now everything people told us 15 16 years
[44:07.180 --> 44:10.940]  ago 17 years ago what the old-timer said chemtrails were is exactly what they
[44:10.940 --> 44:17.020]  now announced just just mass pale male insanity we are living in a matrix like
[44:17.020 --> 44:25.660]  system where you're like I'd like you to unhook my on-star they're not listening
[44:25.660 --> 44:30.940]  to you Alex yes they are well what do you got to hide man I have nothing to hide
[44:30.940 --> 44:37.060]  these are criminals and see now now they know that you've been so conditioned
[44:37.060 --> 44:40.220]  that they don't even mince words I've got articles here where Facebook admits
[44:40.220 --> 44:44.180]  they're selling all your data the government I got articles today admits
[44:44.180 --> 44:50.180]  yeah we're listening to your phone calls without warrants non-care related just
[44:50.180 --> 44:53.820]  five years ago bush got up and press conferences and said it's ridiculous
[44:53.820 --> 44:57.020]  we're not listening to any Americans without warrants and it came out months
[44:57.020 --> 45:01.620]  later they were now it's just like yeah now it's in the news again Dinecore
[45:01.620 --> 45:05.260]  Halliburton all these companies run giant child kidnapping ranks and they
[45:05.260 --> 45:07.940]  they don't even have congressional hearings now when they did six years ago
[45:07.940 --> 45:12.460]  Rumsfeld said yeah they're doing that and the Congress people are like we're
[45:12.460 --> 45:18.660]  gonna do anything and he goes no multinational company
[45:22.460 --> 45:29.620]  and then everybody gets so in to being afraid of Obama and it's so much fun to
[45:29.620 --> 45:36.940]  hate Obama looking for my stack here it's so much fun to get into hating Obama
[45:36.940 --> 45:46.340]  and and and talking about him all day where is my stack of yesterday's news on
[45:46.340 --> 45:52.660]  that I've got a new stack today on it all these newspapers saying he needs to
[45:52.660 --> 45:56.340]  step down he needs to not go for the nomination and I hear all these
[45:56.340 --> 46:00.940]  Republicans on TV and radio laughing going man the Democrats are in total
[46:00.940 --> 46:08.540]  disarray the liberal drive-by media they're so depressed right now their
[46:08.540 --> 46:13.660]  star Obama has fallen I told you he was always meant to fall just like Rick
[46:13.660 --> 46:17.500]  Perry will be meant to fall just like Mitt Romney or Michelle Bachman will be
[46:17.500 --> 46:22.020]  meant to fall they're there to take the blame they're there to say the buck stops
[46:22.020 --> 46:27.220]  here they're there so we all have a Republican Democrat fight and you
[46:27.220 --> 46:30.900]  notice how they're talking about Rahm Emanuel and his scams and he is getting
[46:30.900 --> 46:37.100]  paid off to do solar panel deals that never were and that's just as they get
[46:37.100 --> 46:41.060]  ready to burn some little political dynasty while the big bosses sit up
[46:41.060 --> 46:46.900]  there and laugh about it to give the people a bone they know you're angry
[46:46.900 --> 46:51.340]  about going from a wealthy nation to a poor nation going into bondage so so
[46:51.340 --> 46:55.100]  so they're gonna tear down Obama for you or they're gonna scare him into
[46:55.100 --> 46:58.540]  following orders to go along with the false flag that's the two roads we're
[46:58.540 --> 47:03.140]  going down new puppet president Republicans will then go back to sleep
[47:03.140 --> 47:06.340]  and love all the tyranny all the gains of the Obama people just like the
[47:06.340 --> 47:12.380]  Obama people help continue all of the Bush stuff or they're gonna go ahead
[47:12.380 --> 47:16.420]  and go with Obama and keep him in and bomb a bunch of stuff and blame it on
[47:16.420 --> 47:20.540]  domestic groups they've already baited test and had a full PR rollout that the
[47:20.540 --> 47:23.620]  evil folks that don't like the Federal Reserve and want to get rid of the New
[47:23.620 --> 47:28.180]  World Order and get out of the UN while we're terrorist as this balancing act
[47:28.180 --> 47:31.420]  so they're gonna stage terror attacks and keep Obama in or they're gonna give
[47:31.420 --> 47:36.060]  you a new puppet or you get behind Ron Paul and and even if Ron Paul doesn't
[47:36.060 --> 47:40.420]  win he wins by injecting real ideas but you can believe the government mind
[47:40.420 --> 47:44.060]  trick and say Ron Paul can't win because of election fraud I've talked to every
[47:44.060 --> 47:46.540]  expert out there including people that work for the die-bold and their
[47:46.540 --> 47:52.460]  companies and Bev Harris you name it they can't stop landslides and if they
[47:52.460 --> 47:56.860]  do steal it the evidence of it will come out you've got to fight your enemy to
[47:56.860 --> 48:00.500]  learn their tricks and to show other people what the enemy is doing you
[48:00.500 --> 48:04.500]  can't give up you don't have a choice it's a mind game that's why they're
[48:04.500 --> 48:12.100]  flaunting all of this right now they're trying to make you give up five years
[48:12.100 --> 48:16.780]  ago when I was first talking about Gardasil in 2006 no one was talking
[48:16.780 --> 48:27.660]  about it no one now it's a national issue and the entire establishment is
[48:27.660 --> 48:32.820]  backpedaling but fleeing forward saying we're gonna shoot kids up in
[48:32.820 --> 48:37.660]  California whether their parents like it or not and they call it child consent
[48:37.660 --> 48:41.540]  there's a reason it's called statutory rape if you have sex with a 16 years
[48:41.540 --> 48:48.300]  17 year old even or God forbid younger because they aren't allowed to give
[48:48.300 --> 48:54.460]  consent because they're a minor this is the basic precept of common law so it
[48:54.460 --> 48:58.580]  is a forced inoculation I saw an idiot made a comment on one of our stories
[48:58.580 --> 49:04.300]  saying Jones is at it again saying this is forced inoculations in California
[49:04.300 --> 49:08.420]  that's now on the governor's desk it's past this is the children they're
[49:08.420 --> 49:12.780]  talking about as young as nine years old one article said six it's open for
[49:12.780 --> 49:19.180]  interpretation by the school district Jones is at it again Jones is saying
[49:19.180 --> 49:24.540]  that this is forced inoculation yeah it's forced inoculation it's kidnapping
[49:24.540 --> 49:27.780]  if you pull up in somebody's front of somebody's house and say hey little boy
[49:27.780 --> 49:33.180]  little girl look at my puppy dog I got some candy come on over and get in the
[49:33.180 --> 49:37.460]  car just because you tricked the child to get in your car didn't mean you're not
[49:37.460 --> 49:44.740]  gonna go to the pin if the child's lucky enough to ever be saved you see this is
[49:44.740 --> 49:48.380]  all common sense people don't know it that's why when they say all over the
[49:48.380 --> 49:51.820]  country well if you're 10 year old or 11 year old and this is happening once
[49:51.820 --> 49:56.140]  you get an abortion we won't tell mommy we'll take you to the clinic you got to
[49:56.140 --> 50:00.380]  get a letter for your child to go to the zoo
[50:01.260 --> 50:04.940]  because see they don't care about the zoo and in case your kid gets hurt they
[50:04.940 --> 50:08.460]  want the liability on you but the establishment wants that abortion to
[50:08.460 --> 50:13.100]  happen and so they're gonna go ahead and defend that no matter how many lawsuits
[50:13.100 --> 50:23.300]  they are as the same thing going on with this bill on the governor's desk it is
[50:23.300 --> 50:27.420]  forced inoculation you get kids in there when they're ten years old and show
[50:27.420 --> 50:31.940]  them movies and scary things and this is gonna happen made by Merck then you
[50:31.940 --> 50:36.100]  say now who wants it oh look how brave Jenny is she's the first to raise her
[50:36.100 --> 50:42.380]  hand the nurse is ready for you these are like people getting little kids to
[50:42.380 --> 50:48.060]  get in their pickup truck come here little kid I got some candy for you these
[50:48.060 --> 50:53.340]  are hardcore criminals but see that they got parried a lie and say it's the law
[50:53.340 --> 50:56.780]  I'm gonna make you take shots and that hoax got exposed now they're actually
[50:56.780 --> 51:02.140]  trying to make it the law in California we all know that Berkey water
[51:02.140 --> 51:06.140]  purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration as an
[51:06.140 --> 51:10.060]  authorized Berkey dealer for over six years in serving thousands of satisfied

[54:50.620 --> 54:54.220]  dropped despite the fact that the state wanted him prosecuted the judge
[54:54.220 --> 55:00.500]  actually had a soul wow that's good news so again it's a battle between good and
[55:00.500 --> 55:06.000]  evil when good doesn't take the field this is able to happen so another jam

[55:40.260 --> 55:44.980]  welcome sir you disagree or at the head of the line I do and the first time
[55:44.980 --> 55:50.100]  caller I do have a lot of respect for you I've been an activist for over 30
[55:50.100 --> 55:54.820]  years actually and we're fighting a good fight I'm also a veteran so I take my
[55:54.820 --> 56:00.780]  oath to the Constitution very seriously and I feel your pain I think a lot of us
[56:00.780 --> 56:05.220]  do you know you say you're so frustrated and that leads to anger and my
[56:05.220 --> 56:11.140]  concern is and that can lead to fear so we need focus not fear so what I what I
[56:11.140 --> 56:18.060]  disagree with is what I believe is your sense of humor you you tend to get
[56:18.060 --> 56:24.580]  fictitious you use sarcasm and go on and on and on and I think it deludes your
[56:24.580 --> 56:29.820]  message I think I agree with you listen listen I get what happens is I read this
[56:29.820 --> 56:33.460]  news for hours at night hours in the morning and by the time I get on air
[56:33.460 --> 56:38.460]  it's just so outrageous that on Star is tracking you and selling your data to
[56:38.460 --> 56:42.780]  the government illegally it's so outrageous that they're shooting the
[56:42.780 --> 56:46.380]  troops up with all sorts of experimental vaccines and that's illegal by the way
[56:46.380 --> 56:51.540]  they can make you take a accepted shot but not a ever in the military but not
[56:51.540 --> 56:58.540]  a experimental all of this just I want it to stop I want off the roller coaster
[56:58.540 --> 57:03.220]  I want the ride to end I want people to wake up and so instead of crying I
[57:03.220 --> 57:11.660]  tend to get really sarcastic sometimes I hear you but but fear and sarcasm and
[57:11.660 --> 57:16.980]  frustration are a tool in warrior knows how to use against their enemy well you
[57:16.980 --> 57:22.180]  know you know what Yoda says hate leads to anger and anger leads to what is it
[57:22.180 --> 57:28.900]  anger leads to hate and hate leads to the dark side I hear you I hear you take a
[57:28.900 --> 57:33.580]  deep breath and find your center well here's one thing I need to say to you
[57:33.580 --> 57:37.780]  you know the it takes all sorts to make the world go around different strokes for
[57:37.780 --> 57:42.460]  different folks whatever floats your boat takes all kinds I'm you know what my
[57:42.460 --> 57:46.100]  message is certainly in perfect none of us are but it gets a lot of people out
[57:46.100 --> 57:50.460]  of their days you know I'm mainly here to get people out of their trance and
[57:50.460 --> 57:54.860]  sometimes it takes somebody yelling and screaming to really get people out of
[57:54.860 --> 58:00.060]  their trance to realize how crazy it is sir do you realize this Gardasil is
[58:00.060 --> 58:05.020]  killing people do you realize I mean do you realize they tested it and it's a
[58:05.020 --> 58:10.060]  completely jacked up and designed to cause autoimmune disorders it's just
[58:10.060 --> 58:14.180]  bad or worse than any of us could understand totally it's a hard thing
[58:14.180 --> 58:20.620]  to get your mind around but we all as as truth seekers and warriors for the
[58:20.620 --> 58:24.900]  Constitution and for the truth if you keep our center if I have a good fight so

[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:26.620]  Alex Jones okay we got Lord Moncton coming up with some incredible
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:34.180]  environmentalist power grab fraud they've been caught in we've also got
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.380]  lucradowski in studio a bunch of financial news I want to get to in your
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:44.300]  calls going back to Joe in Ohio for a couple minutes Joe aside from Alex
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:49.020]  Jones in this radio show and your critique of it which I think is fair I
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.180]  mean you know some sarcasm is good but sometimes I get out of control for a
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:59.460]  whole hour it's mainly a form of sorrow your message to listeners on how to
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:06.100]  battle the new world order give us your view the truth will set us free you need
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:11.300]  to plant seeds of the truth I learned a long time ago that grabbing by the shirt
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.260]  collar and shake on school of activism doesn't really work very well you got it
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.780]  just kind of you know feeding when they're ready you can leave the horse to
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:24.300]  water but you can make them drink but we need to keep plenty of water around and
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.780]  that's why I work with a group of people around here that share all your videos
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:33.060]  and a lot of other videos about things like nutrition and fracking and all the
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:37.940]  other crazy things that are going on and another thing to remember we all need
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:41.900]  to remember that we are everywhere I can't tell you you know how many people
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:47.380]  have 9-11 was inside job bumper stickers and I think a lot of times as
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:52.860]  activists or as people that have started to wake up we feel isolated and we're
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:57.140]  you know afraid to upset people by talking about the truth but you know
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:00.820]  just planting seeds when you're in the grocery store standing in line or at the
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:06.940]  gas station and you'd be surprised how many people are waking up but it's a
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:11.820]  long uphill battle we don't want to waste our time casting pearls before
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:17.620]  swine I need to just plant those seeds of truth and like I say when the horse is
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:22.140]  thirsty enough it'll drink so we just got to keep that water around and that's
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:26.060]  why I appreciate all that you do and I really appreciate your gas I think
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:30.300]  that's one of the strongest parts your show is your gas well I think it is as
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.060]  well and that's why I try to bring knowledgeable people here the airwaves
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:37.260]  and then also bring up issues and questions that they may have never been
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:42.700]  asked before to kind of expand the discussion in a larger way good to hear
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:46.780]  from you Joe let's go ahead now and take another call from Laura in
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:53.900]  California you're on the air hi Alex hi hey thanks for taking my call I've been
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:58.620]  a prison planet member for a couple years now I'm living Southern California and
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:04.900]  kind of I can see exactly what Joe's saying about you know the message and
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.660]  how it's delivered and it amazes me at times but then again that's what got me
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:14.700]  on board is some of the things that you were saying and I'm like I've got to
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:20.500]  check this stuff out and at a certain point it just stopped I had I just didn't
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.700]  need to check it out anymore because it was happening on the news and then it
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:29.180]  happens all the time to me and my children well that's a point I need to
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:34.260]  make here is is there's been a shift I've been on air now of almost 17 years
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:40.740]  and until about two years ago none of this stuff was on the news they've now
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.020]  entered the phase where world government's now being announced the
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.740]  world depressions here and they're planned to use that depression to pose
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:52.420]  the saviors and bring in total tyranny is here and and and so also because
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:56.540]  alternative media has exposed them they've decided to go yeah we kidnap
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:01.860]  kids yeah we put poison in your water yeah we ship drugs in and then the
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:08.300]  public sees nothing happens so it's meant to just kind of normalize it now
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:13.020]  well we didn't you know it's just you know the light bulb a little clip on the
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:18.780]  5 a.m. news will will come on it won't come on in the evening but that kind of
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:23.980]  stuff comes on really early or I'll take six but then my daughter comes home two
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.460]  weeks before graduation from high school and it's like well we had drug

[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:33.100]  your calls something that I've said a lot before but that I want to say here
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:37.820]  in a little bit different way and and just succinctly and clearly in a way
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:43.020]  that everybody can understand new listeners those that don't know history
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:48.260]  are doomed to repeat it as Lord Acton said it's absolutely true power
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:55.900]  corrupts an absolute power corrupts absolutely human history is a long
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:09:01.900]  train of examples of where people become passive and decadent and let the very
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:09.380]  worst in society get in control the very worst in society always aspire to the
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:16.220]  most powerful positions in fact I'm going to get some guests on about this
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:19.220]  later in the week I've got their cards and their names I went to some of the
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.940]  different historical societies and some of the different tours in hot springs
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:28.580]  Arkansas and I've actually read books on it as a younger man because I found it
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.780]  so interesting and because it was one of my parents favorite places to vacation
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:36.820]  twice a year when I was a child it was only about five six hours away from
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:43.940]  Dallas and so I already knew most of what they were saying at the different
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:47.620]  historical societies who went to and the organized crime museum they've got
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:52.580]  there but to hear the mainline historians one of them was a filmmaker
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:56.300]  they actually got their film showing at Sundance this year they were telling me
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:00.740]  about it we're gonna get them on but the point is about how the Rockefellers and
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:12.300]  how the lucky Luciano and of course Bugsy Siegel and the Jewish mafia the
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:18.860]  Italian mafia the was mafia Joe Kennedy the Irish mafia were all there and made
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:23.420]  an agreement that it was a zone that that that they wouldn't kill each other
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:28.380]  in and they actually got the idea for it when one of the earlier gangsters was
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:32.660]  going down there for syphilis treatment and learned about how the hot springs
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:38.140]  mountain at the hot springs mountain going back thousands of years native
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:42.660]  tribes more than 10 of them who were always killing each other had a truce to
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:47.780]  not kill each other there on the holy mountain and the mafia liked it so much
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:51.940]  and there was already horse racing and gambling they said let's invest some
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:56.500]  months and they had all the documents and articles in one of the tours some
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:04.580]  months they would make one gangster alone 100 million dollars in 1920s 1930s
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:12.420]  money that's like making four or five billion today individually and they made
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:18.260]  a deal with the US government with a particular brand of water which is one
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:22.620]  of the better and I've read this when I was young and then forgot about it but
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:27.580]  they're in the the tour they were talking about mountain valley spring that we
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:32.060]  actually drank here in the office was announced to be the water of the US
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:40.100]  government and shipped on government trains as a spring water for government
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:45.100]  facilities and that the government would simply fill the big water bottles in
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.780]  fact we have them while I'm at this will somebody go well those are too big we've
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:52.580]  got the big bottles right now I should show people this the water bottles the
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:56.460]  big water cooler bottles were filled with moonshine that's why they went with
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:01.900]  a hillbilly recipe it was Capone's idea this is all admitted to ship it on US
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:05.460]  government trains and and how prohibition was set up by insiders in the
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:09.420]  government to corrupt police and take over society they knew it all they had
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.220]  all the documents said I'd give you a short example of this we got your calls
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:19.100]  and a guest to go to but it was just how they were going over the numbers and
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.660]  how you're told the Rockefellers made their money on oil and transport but
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:26.900]  they really got rich in that decade of prohibition and how then the Rockefellers
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.420]  sent down their son to become the governor and shut down all the gambling
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:35.500]  and moonshining except for what they were producing I mean it went on and on
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:41.900]  all about monopolies just like opium just like cocaine and heroin today we
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:45.940]  are run by organized crime but this is an organized crime where Al Capone
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:51.420]  wouldn't kill a kid which is you know he wouldn't this is a scientific
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.900]  dictatorship because old man Rockefeller funded Hitler funded the
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.420]  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute this is all mainline history you just gonna look it
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:03.340]  up it's typing Rockefellers funded Hitler and they were obsessed with eugenics
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.780]  they had their scientists discover the cancer viruses how to put them in the
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:12.900]  shots we're going to show this tonight on TV on m4's nightly news and you
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:18.980]  realize it's crazy gangsters who who think they're doing the world a favor
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:23.300]  killing everybody I mean it's like it's got a end it's got a end the US
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:28.020]  government giant train loads of Mountain Valley Spring that's really moonshined
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:34.060]  going out to all the speakeasies around the country and they've got maps of
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.900]  where they delivered it to Austin and Houston and areas I've lived and I even
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:41.780]  know some of the famous families here in Austin one of them I went to high
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.060]  school with and of course they ran the liquor for Al Capone and I was told
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:48.500]  about it when I was a kid visit or teenager visit in their house and they
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:52.380]  had news articles about it it just gets weirder and weirder just how this stuff
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:56.340]  is hidden in plain view and where I went to school in Dallas the government was
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.580]  dealing drugs I mean we've got a criminal government and you got all these
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:05.980]  goody-to-shoe Americans who just are blind and and ignorance is not bliss
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:08.700]  though ladies and gentlemen and so here's the point I want to get to them
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:15.540]  we're going to our guest for a quick update than your calls when corruption
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:20.260]  gets to this point and the corrupt never get caught never get busted never
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:24.340]  get in trouble they start thinking they're invincible and bulletproof they
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:28.540]  start recruiting more criminals in and they never want to report on any of the
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:32.620]  other criminals because that might be bad for their operation and then the whole
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:46.900]  system collapses and we have reached this point we have reached this point you
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.900]  know you wonder why the Roman emperors were always so crazy most of them had
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:54.780]  syphilis which is basically the equivalent of a microscopic worm that
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:59.300]  starts eating your brain you wonder why so many of the British royalty were
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:03.300]  crazy most of them had syphilis they were having sex with hundreds of women
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:09.140]  there was no cure for it and then you learn that the Rockefellers and people
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:13.220]  had syphilis and they were crazy and Capone had it was crazy and all these
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:16.500]  gangsters and Rockefellers were down there thinking the mineral baths could
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.940]  heal them actually did in hot spring develop some of the treatments and then
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:24.820]  cures for it later after they died but the point is they're all down there
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:30.500]  crazy with all their prostitutes shipping shipping pure 200 proof liquor
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:35.380]  ever clear out around the country with weird eugenicist scientists teaching
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:40.260]  them that syphilis came from subhumans and that they had to kill off the the
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:45.220]  subhumans that's where their disease had come from crazy men this whole system
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:50.140]  comes out of the minds of multi-billionaires and I'm talking 80 years ago
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:55.820]  multi-billionaires who were crazy with syphilis of course it's totally insane
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:16:01.220]  and they set the foundations up and everything in motion that's running
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:10.780]  everything today on autopilot and they're crazy with syphilis I mean whoa no
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.340]  wonder Caligula married his horse and Nero was running around burning stuff
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:21.380]  down I mean these guys have got worms eating their brains and all this power
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:30.380]  Herod Herod died the Bible describes the governor of Judea well the king of the
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:36.220]  Jews he wasn't the governor and a governor over in Herod died reportedly
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:39.020]  you know they talked about well you ought to read the Bible I'm not going to
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:43.300]  even quote the Bible here but giant pustules and pus pouring out and agony
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:47.980]  pain with sexual diseases and again I'm studying history more and more and
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:51.740]  realizing having these epiphanies in the research that's another reason the
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:57.620]  elite are so crazy they've had syphilis for thousands of years Jack the Ripper
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:01.700]  was the prince that's come out now he was taking which was a treatment for it
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:07.140]  but made you go just as crazy arsenic because if you poison yourself enough it
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:13.540]  would slow the the the the the the syphilitic infection but it would also
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:17.900]  make you psychopathic man I'm really starting to really understand what's
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:22.540]  happened it's so amazing and I already knew all this data but there it was it
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:25.580]  was like wow and I was in the bookstores buying history books about it
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.020]  everything it was all these different historians it's just admitted fact that
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:33.380]  you had crazy syphilis gangsters just machine-gunning each other insanely
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:39.020]  running around with billions of dollars just insane with eugenics doctors
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:44.180]  perched on their shoulders saying kill everyone you can't make this up you
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.340]  can't make this stuff up okay I want to go for this segment the next and I will
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:51.740]  get to your calls and Lord Moncton I want to go to Michael Allison with some
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:56.940]  good news judge rejects eavesdropping charges for recording police and I
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.660]  remember the state came into the county and said we agree we wanted to go to
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:03.980]  jail for life and the state prosecutors been on the news down there advising the
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:08.820]  county so that's what's incredible is the state wanted to send this man this
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:13.740]  auto repair guy this mechanic who restores all cars to jail but now the
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.780]  judge has done the right thing and I guess he won't be moving up the ladder
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:22.460]  now but but again still a little bit of sanity in America but how insane is it
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.660]  that it got to this point Michael Allison tell us what happened to you I was
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:34.620]  waiting for the judges to pin or a decision on the case and all of a
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:38.420]  sudden we started hearing a little bit of rumor about there may have been a
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:43.780]  decision someone heard it on the radio so I called my attorney to try to confirm
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:50.900]  or get some information about the case and he was busy with another client so
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:58.660]  I ended up going up to his office and met him in person and I he was actually
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:03.260]  busy with another client then and I talked to his secretary and she gave me
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:07.980]  a copy of the document and it was basically the judges opinion that came
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:15.140]  down and the charges we had a pending motion to dismiss challenging the
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:20.380]  constitutionality of the statute on three different points and we won on two
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:26.620]  of those points and we did not win on the third point but overall the charges
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:33.100]  were dismissed and the judge decided that the Illinois eavesdropping statute
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:39.180]  is unconstitutional well of course it is publicly filming police or audio
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.860]  recording them there's no perception of privacy in public how do the cops film
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:47.180]  us and this has been thrown out literally hundreds of times they don't
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:53.020]  care the prosecutions will continue because as everybody knows Illinois is
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:58.460]  still has a spirit of Al Capone and big daily over it a bunch of syphilitic
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:02.580]  murdering criminals with their eye back what happened man you used to be

[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:10.140]  well Michael Allison was facing life in prison and they said boy you're going to
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.980]  prison for life and he said nope I'm not gonna plead to a lesser charge
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:19.380]  and just get a few months in jail you go and put me in jail for life and well
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.460]  they didn't back off the state came down and said we wanted to go to jail for
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:27.300]  life the state assisting the county and we've got the judges ruling here he
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:30.980]  ruled on the first amendment and said it was the first amendment right to
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:35.260]  record the police officers and court employees and while a ban on recording
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:38.620]  devices in the courtroom might be justified he said the e-dropping charge
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:42.220]  was inappropriate because it was not secret they were also going after him
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:44.980]  from recording on the street he told him you want me have a court reporter I'm
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:51.180]  gonna record this and they arrested him for it as applied in this case what
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:58.460]  else did the judge say mr. Allison basically that the it was protected
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:05.980]  under the 14th amendment because the statute violates the substantive due
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:14.620]  process because it criminalizes innocent behavior and it it makes the
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:17.860]  criminal charge out of completely innocent behavior before you're ever
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:23.900]  even given a chance to defend yourself they're saying what you did was a crime
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:27.420]  yeah well I know what literally hundreds of other state and federal courts have
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:31.660]  ruled on this in the last few decades but I also know just common sense this
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:36.540]  sounds like something out of North Korea are worse what about the prosecutors
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:41.660]  and people are are they swearing to come after you some other way I talked to my
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:47.900]  attorney about it and he's pretty well convinced that they're probably going
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:55.860]  to appeal it and he said that he told me that if the state attorney was smart he
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:26:01.540]  would just let it drop and be done with it but I don't believe that he's smart
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:08.620]  so I think he's got a personal vendetta this was personal retaliation against me
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:14.940]  and I believe that because that they brought this up the way they did to
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:20.580]  begin with I don't think they want to see that it they lost and and just let
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:26.980]  it drop so I think that they probably will appeal it and if they don't then
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:33.260]  it will not give me the opportunity to defeat the statute unless I can get it
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:37.500]  into the federal court and challenge it on constitutional grounds well Mr.
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:41.860]  Allison you know that these people aren't just wasting taxpayer funds in their
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:46.020]  persecution of you and their attack on the First Amendment they are doing it
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:50.900]  willfully and they are tyrants with a capital T about as big a T as I can
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.740]  imagine and they need to be brought to justice this is official oppression
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:59.180]  your arrest this is false imprisonment this is a civil rights violation and
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:03.500]  they can try the hoax all day that they're individually immune they're
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:08.300]  only immune from civil and criminal prosecution when they're acting within
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:12.220]  the Constitution just like I'm immune if somebody breaks in my house and I blow
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:15.620]  them away just like a cops immune if somebody pulls a gun on them and they
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:19.740]  shoot them the cop is immune under common law this idea that their immune from
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:24.660]  everything is a crock and yeah it's time to go after him criminally now you're
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:29.140]  not going to get the criminal state to do it the feds like to come in and crush
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.020]  the state to make it look like they're the good guys but I doubt they'll defend
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:35.340]  this they've been supporting these attacks on cameras because they don't
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.740]  like it either so I think the route is going to be civil against these
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:45.940]  creatures yeah I think that the that's probably the best route the ACLU case in
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:53.940]  Chicago has a pending challenge against the statute in the northern district of
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:28:00.420]  Illinois and I think that getting it in the civil court and as the as they have
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:07.580]  is definitely the way to go and their case was earlier dismissed out of the
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:13.580]  district court because the district court decided that they lacked standing
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:18.380]  because no one at the ACLU had been criminally charged under the statute now
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:24.420]  I haven't had time Duke to read the whole ruling but did the judge excoriate these
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:32.100]  North Korean admirers anyway there was there was no nothing where they would
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:38.060]  he went after them for the the malicious prosecution that that I believe is the
[01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:43.500]  case there was nothing in the opinion that went after the prosecution of the
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:49.620]  case itself he just simply ruled that the statute based on my attorney's
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:56.700]  arguments were that my arguments were a winning argument to say that the statute
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:29:01.020]  could not stand well the tyrants are going to continue to prosecute we're
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:04.140]  going to continue to beat them if they ever actually put somebody in prison for
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:08.220]  a long time they put some in jail for a while for this you'll become martyrs and
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:12.300]  you must resist them eternally and people need to realize this is a big
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:16.540]  wake-up call 12 states know it's not illegal but are attempting to put
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:20.820]  people in jail for as long as 12 years the Allison case was out of control
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:25.500]  because it was life in prison and it just lets you know these are conscious
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:30.740]  tyrants and police all of you that go along with this do you feel safe living
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.860]  in a country do you think your pension funds are going to be safe for your

[01:34:55.300 --> 01:35:00.300]  I've seen it in major newspapers all over the world they're being forced
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:03.300]  to report on this the Daily Mail has the headline
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:07.300]  global warming and the twisting of our children's minds
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:11.300]  and this is going on in one of the most prestigious publications
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:14.300]  they've been caught putting out fake maps
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:18.300]  showing that Greenland is melting
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:22.300]  when it's not and showing islands where the ice is supposedly melted
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:25.300]  saying there are new islands when those islands already existed
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:29.300]  and were not covered by ice so just absolute fraud
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:33.300]  systematically from pillar to post we'll be talking about it with Lord Monkton

[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:48.300]  and then we have the internal emails that is hide the decline
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:52.300]  don't let this get out it's systematic fraud

[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:19.300]  now going to Lord Christopher Monkton who by the way joined us
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:23.300]  last week on the nightly news I had to get him on
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:27.300]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice to deal with yet another
[01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:31.300]  fraud that we've caught academia the establishment
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:35.300]  in a unified desperate cult
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:39.300]  exercise in
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:43.300]  authoritatively attempting
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:47.300]  to appeal to authority and deceive people with fake maps
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:51.300]  they predicted all these islands the pacific would be under water
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:55.300]  they're actually now
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:59.300]  dropping sea levels so now they say that's global warming and they can't even
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:03.300]  get their propaganda straight always the answer is shut down power plants in England
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:07.300]  Europe the US moving to China for Maury Strong or Al Gore
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:11.300]  Prince Phillips investments and it says here Lord Monkton
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:15.300]  is a British statesman public speaker former newspaper editor
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:19.300]  former member of the conservative party and this is an old bio he's back
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:23.300]  he's one of the heads of the UK independence party right now
[01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:27.300]  Monkton has been the head of the policy unit the UK independence party
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:31.300]  since 2010 he served as deputy leader of the party under Lord Pearson
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:35.300]  he also served in the conservative central office
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:39.300]  and worked as one of the top advisors to Margaret Thatcher number 10 policy unit
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:43.300]  during the 1980s of course he spoke out against Bilderberg and world government
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:47.300]  per his advice he also worked
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:51.300]  for the universe the Sunday Telegraph today the evening standard
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:55.300]  scienceandpublicpolicy.org is his website
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:59.300]  scienceandpublicpolicy.org I would have to say out of anybody out there
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:03.300]  even more than Mark Moreno who's a great mind Lord Christopher Monkton
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:07.300]  is the chief prosecutor of this tyranny
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:11.300]  the chief person in the face facing
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:15.300]  demonization calls for arrest oaksies like they say
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:19.300]  Rand Paul is not a medical doctor or Ron Paul is an elitist or
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:23.300]  they worship Buddha secretly they tried saying he's not a
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:27.300]  Lord when it's on record he is every form of fraud
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:31.300]  has been leveled against him and he's come out unscathed and they will
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:35.300]  not debate him but again scienceandpublicpolicy.org he joins us for the balance
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:39.300]  of the hour to go over the latest well there's so many now
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:43.300]  one of the biggest frauds in the last 24 hours Lord Monkton
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:47.300]  don't we enter a danger zone here though that so many frauds
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:51.300]  are coming out now that even though each one of these is bigger than climate gate
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:55.300]  now there's so many of them we don't really savor properly
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:59.300]  and that a lot of this is running off like spilt
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:03.300]  milk into the gutter that's a very good analogy
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:07.300]  but I think a better analogy is with what happened under fascism
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:11.300]  in Germany and under communism
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:15.300]  in Russia and still does happen under communism in China
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:19.300]  these totalitarian regimes lie and lie and lie
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:23.300]  all the time and what we have now are the new legalists
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:27.300]  the new totalitarians who are using the global
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:31.300]  warming scare as a kind of Trojan horse
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:35.300]  to get away with pushing global government through
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:39.300]  and what they're doing is they're saying right we can make up any old rubbish
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:43.300]  because we've now got the media where we want them
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:47.300]  we've got the entire political left where we want it because of course the left
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:51.300]  is fascist it is communist it always has been that's what
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:55.300]  it was the national socialist workers party of Germany
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:59.300]  and of course the communists call themselves socialist too
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:03.300]  so these extremists are all the left and they've decided they are now so strong
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:07.300]  that they can get away with lying and lying and lying again
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:11.300]  it used to be under fascism in Germany or Italy
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:15.300]  and under communism in China or Russia nobody is now
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:19.300]  believing a word they say and when the times of all people
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:23.300]  comes out with an atlas of the world and wipes off
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:27.300]  or plans to wipe off Tuvalu and the Maldives on the ground
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:31.300]  that these are about to disappear beneath the rising waves
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:35.300]  when we've just had a year of sea level falling really rather rapidly
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:39.300]  and sea level is only rising in any case
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:43.300]  at a rate equivalent to one foot per century much as it has been for the last
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:47.300]  one and a half to two centuries then you've got to wonder what they're on
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:51.300]  and please could I have some it is really quite extraordinary let's take the Maldives
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:55.300]  you know I like to do this Alex a few facts
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:59.300]  now Professor Nicholas Murno who's the ranking expert in the world on sea level
[01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:03.300]  knows more about than anybody else he has spent 10 years
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:07.300]  researching the Maldives meticulously in greater detail than anywhere else
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:11.300]  in the world to do with sea level and he has found that in the last
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:15.300]  50 years there hasn't been any sea level rise in the Maldives nor has there
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:19.300]  in Tuvalu nor have there in most of these Pacific islands and the
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:23.300]  reason why is apart from anything else that corals grow
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:27.300]  to meet the light and if water comes over them they grow
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:31.300]  a bit more and catch up and remake and make a new shoreline and in fact
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:35.300]  a recent paper in this peer-reviewed literature has measured
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:39.300]  several of these islands throughout the Pacific and has found that indeed
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:43.300]  they are growing they're well able to keep up with such little sea level
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:47.300]  rise as there has been of course there's been none in the last year or you could
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:51.300]  go to Bangladesh another of the places where the times has got its
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:55.300]  eraser out and wiped out bits of the coastline in fact apart from a little coastal
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:59.300]  erosion which has nothing to do with global warming and everything to do
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:03.300]  with clearing the mangrove swaps so they can put prawn farms in
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:07.300]  and then the waves come in and wash the sand away that the mangroves were naturally holding
[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:11.300]  together apart from that there has been no loss of land
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:15.300]  in Bangladesh indeed because sea level in that region has
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:19.300]  fallen somewhat over the last 10 or 15 years
[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:23.300]  there's 7,000 square kilometers of extra land in
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:27.300]  Bangladesh but you won't find that on the Times
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:31.300]  map how do I know all this because Niklas Murner went to Bangladesh last
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:35.300]  December with a group of scientists he was the only one who bothered
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:39.300]  to calibrate his satellite altimeter correctly
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:43.300]  by climbing 100 meters up and down so that the
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:47.300]  thing could register properly he was then able to go all along the
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:51.300]  shoreline of Bangladesh he noted the coastal erosion and what had caused it
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:55.300]  nothing to do with global warming with man-made stupidity locally
[01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:59.300]  cutting away the mangroves swamps and he was able to measure which none of the others
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:03.300]  could because they didn't calibrate their instruments properly that sea level in Bangladesh
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:07.300]  has actually fallen so all of this nonsense is
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:11.300]  gradually being nailed because people are seeing as Professor Murner
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:15.300]  is seeing with their own eyes that the stories were being told in the Times
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:19.300]  Atlas or on Al Gore's fatuous 24 hours of so-called
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:23.300]  reality I don't know what planet he lives on but it's not the same one as mine
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:27.300]  Lord Mountain I want to get to Al Gore's 24 hours of Bologna
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:31.300]  that Mark Moreno at Climate Depot categorized
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:35.300]  dozens and dozens and dozens of all the greenies saying get rid of
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:39.300]  Al Gore he's no longer useful he's discredited
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:43.300]  so even his own system like the proletariat
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:47.300]  or the Duma or something you know the
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:51.300]  minions of the communist system and the commissars
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:55.300]  above them are all turning against him and saying throw him out
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:59.300]  but here's the Daily Mail and this is in a bunch of other newspapers as well and we'll put it on screen
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:03.300]  for people that are watching on PrismPlanet.tv not just listing on the radio
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:07.300]  your radio listener just search the term global warming and the twisting
[01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:11.300]  of our children's minds that's out of DailyMail.co.uk
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:15.300]  but it's also in a bunch of other papers they're having to admit it as well
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:19.300]  but saying it's just a mistake the Times Atlas of the World that Lord
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:23.300]  just mentioned regularly updated since the Victorian age proudly presents
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:27.300]  itself as the most authoritative Atlas in the world that's a quote
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:31.300]  you just peer reviewed you cannot question it but in its latest
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:35.300]  hefty edition published an eye-watering piece
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:39.300]  for 150 pounds that's almost $300 ladies and gentlemen
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:43.300]  has become the focus of a bizarre climate change row or fight
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:47.300]  the new Atlas shows the ice in Greenland the northern hemisphere's largest
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:51.300]  ice cap to be melting so fast since 2009 nearly a six
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:55.300]  of it is vanished an area the size of Britain and Iceland combined once covered
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:59.300]  in ice and snow has become green and ice free but then of course their
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:03.300]  satellite photos they go through that show that hasn't happened the publishers
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:07.300]  said the map revealed a whole new island off Greenland's coast formerly
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:11.300]  viewed as part of the mainland but which is vanishing ice is now shown to be quite
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:15.300]  separate local inhabitants have been celebrating the event by giving
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:19.300]  it an inlet name meaning warming island but no sooner was the shocking
[01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:23.300]  evidence of global warming reported that voices throughout the scientific community began to question
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:27.300]  the Atlas's claims and it turns out for 50 years the island
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:31.300]  has been there and photographed it turns out that it has
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:35.300]  settlements it turns out it was all a complete lie it's not an island where
[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:39.300]  the ice sheet disappeared and there's now an island and it goes through it so just
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:43.300]  like Kilimanjaro's ice has come back in Africa and it shows that it's cyclical
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:47.300]  or the ice caps are growing again on Mars and Lord
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:51.300]  and I had David Rothschild on he said well that's because Mars is closer to the
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:55.300]  Sun than Earth and I said no it's not it's the next planet out and he said no it's not your conspiracy theorist
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:59.300]  so now it's Mercury, Venus, Mars, Earth
[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:03.300]  not Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and that interviews public
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:07.300]  I mean that's the and he laughed at me thinking my audience
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:11.300]  was dumb and so since that's all been exposed the Himalayas haven't melted
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:15.300]  they've just moved on to a new fraud and no sooner do we expose that a new fraud
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:19.300]  and it's just leapfrogging and meanwhile Bill Clinton and I'll stop
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:23.300]  ranting as the nerve to come out today and say
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:27.300]  in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer climate deniers make us look like a
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.300]  joke and says that basically Americans look like mentally ill jokes
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:35.300]  to the world because we don't accept Al Gore on
[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:39.300]  everything he says and I'm sorry Lord Monk and I had to go over that
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.300]  so there's just no end to the fraud. No you're quite right and just take
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:47.300]  this Greenland thing I mean there was a wonderful paper on Greenland
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:51.300]  by Johannes and Et al in 2005
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:55.300]  in which he said that practically right across the vast ice sheet except
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:59.300]  just at the fringes the ice sheet had actually
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:03.300]  thickened by two inches per year for 12 years a total of
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:07.300]  two feet right across that ice sheet now that is an enormous
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:11.300]  increase in ice and then in a subsequent paper he said well some of it's gone back into the ocean
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:15.300]  about a quarter of it in fact but most of it's still up there which is one of the reasons
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:19.300]  why sea level is falling so all of these claims that are now being
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:23.300]  made are very stupid claims of course the left wing
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:27.300]  media will continue not to publish the truth most of them they'll go on
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:31.300]  just peddling the lies just as they did in Nazi Germany
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:35.300]  or communist Russia how do you think those regimes manage to survive
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:39.300]  because the media will always fall upon power
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:43.300]  and if the left if the communists
[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:47.300]  were strong enough the fascists were brutal enough then the press would fall upon them
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:51.300]  and they would only get interviews with the great ones
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:55.300]  if they were willing to tell the party like Al Gore won't debate with me
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:59.300]  he won't in fact answer unscripted questions at any of his talks
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:03.300]  he won't answer questions from journalists unless they have been
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:07.300]  cleared by his staff as being so dopy, acquiescent or asleep
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:11.300]  of the switch just interrupt again Lord Moncton because I want you to speak to this directly then
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:15.300]  last week when you were on with us what last Wednesday or Thursday I dubbed the interview
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:19.300]  the fall of Al Gore and then now over the weekend and this weekend
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:23.300]  even his supporters said he has fallen go away
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:27.300]  they said resign stop speaking is this not a giant victory
[01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:31.300]  that their grand champion has been taken down by
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:35.300]  yourself and the facts? I think it's the facts that have done it
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:39.300]  I mean certainly it helped that I was one of those I in fact wrote the scientific
[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:43.300]  testimony in the court case against him
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:47.300]  which we had in the UK in 2007
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:51.300]  certainly take credit you have been on him like
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:55.300]  a hunting dog after a fox
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:59.300]  I've been trying to debate with him even it got to the point where the republicans in congress
[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:03.300]  ran me up and they said get yourself on a plane to Washington
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:07.300]  we've heard that Al Gore is going to be testifying in front of the energy and commerce committee
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:11.300]  and we want you to be the republican witness replying to him
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:15.300]  and I got on the plane and when I landed they said terribly sorry it's all
[01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:19.300]  cancelled because the moment the democrats heard that you
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:23.300]  were going to be the witness they said you can have anyone else
[01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:27.300]  but you can't have Moncton so Newt Gingrich stood in for me
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:31.300]  and didn't do too bad a job but that shows how frightened
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:35.300]  they are of the truth they know I know where
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:39.300]  all the bodies are buried in this they know I've done the science and done the research and got
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:43.300]  the answers I'm no genius goodness knows you don't have to be
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:47.300]  you just have to be very persistent very patient sitting at the feet
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:51.300]  of the great scientist around the world asking interminable stupid questions
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:55.300]  until you eventually understand it stay there stay there sir we gotta go
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:59.300]  back and talk about where these fraudsters are going in the future and let you make any other points
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:03.300]  you'd like to make stay with us

[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:17.300]  All right. Lord Moncton was trying to make a point there as we went to break and I wanted to be able to finish it, but I also want to talk about the fact that I'm sure he's seen this in the news.
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:32.300]  John P. Holdren has admitted they've got weather modification tests that have been going on, barium salts, aluminum dioxide, sulfur particles that now they want to start spraying into the atmosphere to save the earth.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:38.300]  Is this just an exercise now where they're going to say, look, we didn't have global warming because we saved you?
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:51.300]  I mean, they are basically casting themselves like a Hollywood movie as our saviors. Is there any way to get these control freaks, Lord Moncton, out of our lives?
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:59.300]  Oh, yes, there is. In those countries like America, but unlike Britain, where your government is still elected by you.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:10.300]  We have elections, but we elect merely a Duma, which has no power. The European dictatorship now crushes us under the heel of endless pettifogging bureaucracy.
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:20.300]  But you still have in the United States, in Canada, in Australia, in many parts of the English speaking world, the right to make and un-make your governments.
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:26.300]  And it's only your governments that can make and un-make your laws. So you wear the trousers and you can vote them out.
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:29.300]  But then Al Gore can't save me.
[01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:36.300]  Hang on a moment. Holdren can't save you. He's an incompoop. Everybody knows, even he knows he's an incompoop.
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:45.300]  But the point is that Obama and all his weird administration of kooks and crazies like Stephen Choo who said the solution was to paint the world white.
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:52.300]  These people, you know, I don't know what they're on, but I wish I had some. It really is. It's just crazy now.
[01:55:52.300 --> 01:56:03.300]  What is happening here, and I've seen this before in government, is they've suddenly said to themselves, oh my gosh, we've got it wrong.
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:11.300]  They know this now. And the thing that is frightening them more than anything else, which is why they're not even mentioning it yet,
[01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:22.300]  is that a very good professor down in Sydney called Murray Salby has been quietly doing some research. It's taken him two years.
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:34.300]  Shut away in his ivory tower with the IV growing into the window. He's been there quietly working away at some rather startling, very new satellite evidence.
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:40.300]  I've seen it. The rest of the world hasn't yet, but I can tell you a little bit about it without breaching any confidence.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:49.300]  What he chose is there is absolutely no connection between the vast centres of population where the CO2 is being emitted by us
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:59.300]  and the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is not uniform as the IPCC has been trying to tell us.
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:09.300]  It varies all over the world, but the variations over land at any rate have absolutely nothing to do with where we are or the emissions we're putting out.
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:15.300]  I'll tell you what causes those variations. It is the temperature of the air around them.
[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:22.300]  Do you know the place on the Earth which has the highest CO2 concentration as seen by these satellites have measured from space?
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:23.300]  No.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:39.300]  It's Taklamakan Desert in western China, north of Tibet. It's just a desert. There's nothing there, but that's where the highest concentration of CO2 is. Why? Because it's one of the hottest places on Earth and it's surrounded almost entirely by mountains,
[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:52.300]  unlike the Sahara which of course is vastly more open. And so there you find this high, I say it's only 5% above the world average, but nevertheless that is significant because what it tells us is the reason why
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:58:00.300]  there is more CO2 in the atmosphere is that it has got warmer for other reasons and not the other way around.
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:12.300]  So this means that whatever the climate sensitivity is, however much warming a given amount of CO2 might cause, the CO2 that we are putting in the atmosphere has practically nothing to do with it.
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:25.300]  And this frankly is the end of the scare. He's coming out with a book on it in a couple of weeks time and you heard it here first because it's not being publicized. You can imagine how little the left-wing news media like this story.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:29.300]  And there will be a peer-reviewed paper following sometime early next year.
[01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:50.300]  Lord Monk to do 5 more minutes with us and I'm going to do calls. We've got Luke Radowski coming in because I want you to really boil the science down in layman's terms for people.
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:10.300]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:19.300]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:26.300]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:31.300]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:36.300]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:42.300]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.300 --> 02:00:00.300]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:22.300]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:39.300]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Lord Christopher Monkton is our guest.
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:47.300]  Again, they have had to admit that they put out fake maps, Atlas of the World showing Greenland melting when it actually was expanding.
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:50.300]  They've had to basically apologize and say it was a mistake now.
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:55.300]  But Lord Monkton, you were getting to CO2 levels, rising after heat goes up.
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:01:04.300]  And of course, we've known that for a while that Al Gore flips the graphs, but this new information is bombshell and you're breaking it here with this peer-reviewed journal coming out in the next two weeks.
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:06.300]  So please tell us more.
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:13.300]  Right. It's a book that's coming out in the next couple of weeks. Peer-reviewed article next year. Strange way around, but that's the way he's doing it.
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:18.300]  And he's been working on this for two years. I got to hear about it six months ago.
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:25.300]  I wasn't allowed to see any of the details. Eventually I got hold of him and said, look, come on, I need to know a little bit about this. It's very exciting.
[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:32.300]  He said, okay, I'll give you an outline. I still haven't seen the graphs, but I've seen this map of CO2 concentrations.
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:43.300]  And it is quite, quite fascinating because it's very, very clear that there's something going on, that none of the models had suspected, none of the learned journals and scientists had suspected.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:52.300]  This is real world, new data, analyzed by somebody who previously, like me, many years ago, he thought maybe we had a problem with CO2.
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:59.300]  Now he says, as a result of this research, he doesn't think we've got a problem anymore. If we have, it's not a problem. There's anything to do with us.
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:04.300]  We are simply not influential in changing the climate at all.
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:13.300]  Now, of course, let's be careful about this. I always am. I don't want to over age this pudding, but it hasn't yet been examined by anybody else.
[02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:25.300]  I've only heard one side of the story. What I have heard impresses me. I know he's been speaking to other scientists whom I respect, and they impress me, and they have in turn been impressed by him.
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:38.300]  So it is beginning to look as though there is something in this. And that's not all. Not so long ago, Roy Spencer, who runs the satellites that catch all this data about temperature and CO2 and other things in the atmosphere,
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:49.300]  he published a paper not so long ago confirming a result he came out with the previous year, which was attacked by the usual suspects that climate gate emails piled in and said, no, no, he was wrong.
[02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:56.300]  And what he was saying is that clouds actually cause more of a cooling effect on Earth than a warming effect.
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:03:05.300]  Fairly obvious you think about it, but the models were trying to tell us it was the other way around, because that was the only way they could make out we had a problem with CO2.
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:22.300]  Now, a paper by a guy whom I debated against a couple of years ago, who has now changed sides, he's a scientist at Reading University, Richard Allen. He has found that in fact the clouds do indeed have a cooling effect and not a warming effect.
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:40.300]  This changes all the numbers in the models. So the science is coming in from all directions now and showing what nonsense all this is. And if I can add also to this the economic point, because I'm going to be in Santa Fe in a month's time,
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:51.300]  at the third Santa Fe Climate Conference, which is one of the very few conferences around the world where scientists on both sides of the debate are allowed to take part in debates with one another.
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:04:05.300]  And I'm going to be there to give this time an economic rather than a scientific message, because I've developed a way of allowing policymakers worldwide, even if they know nothing much about either economics or climate science,
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:16.300]  to work out just how cost-effective or cost-ineffective in making global warming go away any individual policy that you might implement actually is.
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:27.300]  And I've been running this metric now, using it with various governments around the world, showing them how cost-ineffective this is. When the Chinese saw it, they said, this changes everything.
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:38.300]  So they said there's just no real basis for our wasting any more time on this. I said no, of course from the propaganda point of view, you maybe want to be seen to be going green in the way that is fashionable at the moment.
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:41.300]  But for heaven's sake, don't spend too much of your people's money on this.
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:49.300]  Come on, Tim, we're out of time. Scienceofpublicpolicy.org. Thank you so much for being with us. We're going to come back with Luke Radowski and your phone calls and more news. Stay with us.
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:30.300]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They soak right in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:40.300]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.

[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:12.300]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:24.300]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:34.300]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:23.300]  And we've already had 40 billion dollars worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes and droughts. And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:31.300]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans. The huge issue of the Great Depression is on everyone's mind.
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:39.300]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American, so everyone needs food security.
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:46.300]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoodsDirect. That's right, every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.

[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:28.300]  Wow, I am processing the call I just got. Jesse Ventura, a poor Minnesota governor, just called the hotline and gave me some pretty much off the record.
[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:36.300]  But then he said, well, it can be on the record. And he said, well, maybe it's just better I come on. So we'll probably get him on next week.
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:52.300]  He told me he was going to give me the exclusive once the judge ruled whether his lawsuit against the TSA were violating his Fourth Amendment and Americans with Disabilities Act that he was going to give us the first interview once that happened.
[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:59.300]  Then he'd do a press conference and then give us the first interview. And then he just called up and said, yeah, obviously they haven't ruled yet.
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:08.300]  And so that's why I haven't been on your show yet. And then he gave me some kind of inside baseball stuff that's going on, but it looks good. What's happening?
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:16.300]  But you know what, I just, then he said I could say what he told me, but you know what, I'm just going to leave it until he joins us next week.
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:23.300]  And Jared, don't let me forget. Ventura wants me to call him Monday. Of course, I'll always forget.
[02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:32.300]  So it's good to hear from him. He's such a real guy. Folks are always trying to demonize Ventura. But you know what, that's who I admire as real people like Lord Christopher Monkton, who was on with us earlier.
[02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:45.300]  Now, I know we've had callers that have been patiently holding for over an hour. And I apologize for that. But you know what, the ruling just came down that Michael Allison facing life in prison.
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:54.300]  That that's been thrown out of court, but that it looks like the state's going to appeal and keep trying to throw him in prison for life or taping cops in public.
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:10:03.300]  You now live in North Korea or worse. And then the Lord Monkton thing broke where they've been caught putting out fake maps about Greenland and disappearing when it hasn't.
[02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:10.300]  So that happened. And that happens a lot on the show. We've got a big, big special in depth full spectrum analysis of Gardasil.
[02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:19.300]  I covered it some last night. But tonight, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who they've run hoaxes against as well. Again, these are bold face liars.
[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:28.300]  They have had scientists funded by Merck and by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and by Big Pharma publicly come out, three of them.
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:38.300]  And the media says they're independent. And they say not one person's been hurt by Gardasil. I'll give Michelle Bachman $10,000 if she can show me one example.
[02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:48.300]  The CDC says 18,000 plus adverse reactions, including death. We show the documents. I mean, just type in Gardasil death. You'll get CBS, ABC, NBC.
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:56.300]  It's been going on five years. It's a major controversy. And they just sit there with a bold, not one person's been hurt.
[02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:02.300]  And people start sending emails going, Alex, what is this? They say nobody's been hurt. They're counting on you not looking.
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:11.300]  They came out last year or earlier this year and said, Dr. Wakefield's been discredited. This reporter, it turns out his connections to Big Pharma, says he faked his research.
[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:19.300]  And then you go look and there's no evidence of it. And Wakefield's saying, I didn't fake anything. And then I have Ed Asner on yesterday.
[02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:34.300]  And Ed Asner has the nerve to dare challenge vaccines over the years so he gets demonized. And then they come out and say Wakefield's been discredited. And Asner has an autistic, what do you say, son and grandson?
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:46.300]  He goes, well, I guess I was wrong. That's been discredited. I'm like, no, it hadn't Ed. No, it hadn't. It's the boldness of this, the boldness of not letting the firefighters and police be at ground zero this year because they know they're angry.
[02:11:46.300 --> 02:11:53.300]  The boldness of the EPA's own documents. I'm going to show those tonight where they knew day one it was deadly dust and we're ordered to cover it up. That's all public.
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:12:03.300]  They still have debates about whether the dust was bad or not. Huge asbestos buildings, four feet of deadly dust. That's what's frustrating.
[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:12.300]  I mean, here's another headline out of CBS News, Chicago. Property values down, but property taxes up. Same thing living in here. I don't live in Travis County anymore. I live right outside town.
[02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:23.300]  My property taxes go up and up and up and up and my property value goes down and down and down and they just don't care. And you can go try to challenge it. They don't care.
[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:33.300]  It's a rent on property. I don't own my property. I pay rent to the government. That's feudalism. We didn't have a property tax till 50 years ago in this country. It's a joke.
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:47.300]  Didn't it? We're living under terror here. We have no chance. Now, when you go to your calls coming up, there's a lot to talk about and I'm going to cover a shmattering of important news here with Luke Radowski joining us today.
[02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:50.300]  Luke, it is so good to have you here in studio in Austin, Texas.
[02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:56.300]  Thanks for having me. It's beautiful here. You have a great staff. I want to thank everybody here. Amazing guys working with you and it's an honor and a pleasure being here.
[02:12:56.300 --> 02:13:00.300]  You couldn't go out to eat with us last night because you were hanging out with a lady friend here in Austin.
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:06.300]  No comment. You may get arrested for being heterosexual nowadays.
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:08.300]  I wouldn't surprise me now because of what's going on.
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:11.300]  You're some kind of thought criminal pal.
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:18.300]  Oh, boy. All right, Luke, enough of me. I'll talk forever. What is foremost on your mind right now?
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:25.300]  News is breaking all day. Just right now, I got notice from Adam Kochesh that his charges were dropped for dancing at the Jefferson Memorial.
[02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:35.300]  I was out there in New York City during the Occupy Wall Street event and I'm telling you it was an amazing sight seeing hundreds of people come together from all walks from different spectrums,
[02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:38.300]  coming together because they're sick and tired of what's happening in this world.
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:45.300]  I'm glad you're here on that. Give us a report on that because we know there were now arrests yesterday and they blocked that area of Wall Street so you couldn't even get in there.
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:47.300]  This is like Tiananmen Square.
[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:56.300]  It's ridiculous what's happening and that's why Yahoo is even censoring emails with people who are sending out the occupywallstreet.org email and sending out information about what's happening down there.
[02:13:56.300 --> 02:14:02.300]  And it's pretty ridiculous. I mean, there's hundreds of people. There's more cops than protesters, though. Cops blocked off all of Wall Street.
[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:11.300]  But see how you just glazed over that. And myself, we've gotten conditioned now where in San Francisco they admit they turned off the cell phones because of a peaceful protest.
[02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:20.300]  Now, I mean, this is what they do in third world dictatorships. Can't send that email saying protest in America. Can't have a cell phone during a protest.
[02:14:20.300 --> 02:14:22.300]  I mean, they're really getting ready for collapse.
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:33.300]  Yeah. And police blocked off all of Wall Street. Nobody, anybody, nobody could even walk near Wall Street. They blocked off blocks of areas and the police were following protesters everywhere they went.
[02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:43.300]  They finally found one square. And what's really beautiful about this is we have, you know, socialists, communists with Ron Pollars, with end-of-fetters, with first responders, with not 11 truthers all together.
[02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:45.300]  That's what scares the globalists.
[02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:52.300]  Exactly. And that's why, you know, that's why there's so much censorship. That's why it's such an important thing that I was there because Lupie Fiasco was there, Roseanne Barr was there.
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:15:01.300]  We got interviews with them on our YouTube channel. And it's amazing seeing all these people from all these spectrums sitting together breaking bread and having conversations with each other about where do we go from here?
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:03.300]  What's going to happen in the future? What are we going to do?
[02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:13.300]  Well, yeah, whether you're a hardcore libertarian bordering on anarchy like I am or the socialist head, Asner, they agree you got to go after the banks or the fellow reserve. It's the problem.
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:21.300]  And they don't like that. They want Republican Democrat fighting. They want to be able to burn the puppet Obama at the stake politically.
[02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:29.300]  I won't cry about that, but not if it's a political diversion. They don't want us looking up at the real power structure because once that happens, it's game over.
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:34.300]  Exactly. And once you find the sleeping place of the vampire, it's over.
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:43.300]  And it's an amazing scene. These people put their lives on a line being beat up by police officers sleeping out there, eating out there, living out there just because they have nothing else to do.
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:52.300]  Protests don't work. So now they're moving to a new system that worked in Egypt, that worked in Spain, that worked in Greece, where people are just coming into the main squares and saying, look, enough is enough.
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:56.300]  We have no jobs. We have no economic opportunities growing up.
[02:15:56.300 --> 02:15:59.300]  But in Greece, they're able to get in the square, not in America.
[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:03.300]  Yeah, they blocked off one little square with police officers encircling them in New York City.
[02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:12.300]  And right now, just yesterday, they beat up people because they put up a tarp over video camera equipment. They have a live feed going and they set up a tarp over the video equipment.
[02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:16.300]  When it was raining, the cops came in literally just beat up people, dragged people through people.
[02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:20.300]  Well, we got footage a year where they walk up and say, we're going to put you in jail for terrorism for the camera.
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:23.300]  You say, but officer, that's not true. We're going to put you in jail.
[02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:24.300]  Yeah, right on camera.
[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:26.300]  That's America. Yeah, but we have to fight back.
[02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:30.300]  I mean, so criminal, I keep going back to this, they do it on camera now.
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:34.300]  Yeah, we have to understand, we have a lot more authority now than we ever did before.
[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:39.300]  That video camera, you could show the world the truth in just one glimpse and like one little quick video.
[02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:41.300]  And it's such an amazing power we have.
[02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:42.300]  And we could fight this.
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:46.300]  I mean, in Spain, when I covered these same exact protests, police officers came and beat up people.
[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:52.300]  There was blood in the streets, bones were broken, like huge batons were used against women, children.
[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:55.300]  Old people were battered in the streets in Spain.
[02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:57.300]  And that's the government has hired criminals.
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:16:59.300]  But then this is the beautiful thing that happened.
[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:02.300]  The videos came out online and the whole city of Barcelona came out.
[02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:05.300]  I'm talking about almost a million people in the streets of Barcelona.
[02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:08.300]  And I came out there, as soon as I heard all the news, that was happening.
[02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:12.300]  It's like the footage of the UN troops raping little kids has come out in Haiti.
[02:17:12.300 --> 02:17:14.300]  That's right, we're going to show who you are.
[02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:16.300]  We're going to use your big brother tool against you.
[02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:17.300]  But this is what happened.
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:19.300]  A million people came out on the street saying, enough is enough.
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:20.300]  We stand with these people.
[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:23.300]  We are the people. We had enough of that 1% screwing everybody over.
[02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:27.300]  And the next day, when everybody left, and there were still people sleeping there,
[02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:29.300]  there wasn't a police officer in sight.
[02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:33.300]  And when I came there, and when I was documenting everything, I never even saw a police officer there.
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:35.300]  They were afraid. They backed up. They backed far.
[02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:37.300]  Yeah, but what kind of cop wants to beat women?
[02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:41.300]  I've seen the footage of them beating women, spraying pepper spray in babies' faces.
[02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:42.300]  And the mother says, why'd you do that?
[02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:44.300]  And they say, you bleeper, don't take a kid to a protest.
[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:46.300]  Insecure, angry, fearful people.
[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:49.300]  And I think the main problem we face in our society is fear.
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:53.300]  I mean, police officers, sadly, have to deal with the worst in our community.
[02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:55.300]  And they fear everybody.
[02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:57.300]  They're afraid of people because they see the worst in people.
[02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:59.300]  But we have to show them and show them respect.
[02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:02.300]  And that's what's happening also in Spain and in New York City right now is saying,
[02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:04.300]  you're not the enemy. You're one of us.
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:05.300]  Your pensions are being screwed.
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:07.300]  Some of the cops are nice that hadn't come over.
[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:11.300]  But man, in New York, a lot of the cops, they look like something out of a joke,
[02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:13.300]  out of a comic book of a corrupt cop.
[02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:17.300]  Belly hanging out, hat on the back of their head, smoking cigarettes, cigars going,
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:19.300]  you know the types they're talking about.
[02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:21.300]  They're all insecure and they feed on your fear.
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:22.300]  They want to intimidate you.
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:25.300]  But as soon as you look them in the eyes and you show them you're not afraid of them,
[02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:26.300]  they don't know what to do.
[02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:27.300]  They start studdling.
[02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:28.300]  They start mumbling.
[02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:29.300]  They start...
[02:18:29.300 --> 02:18:30.300]  No, I know.
[02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:33.300]  Because once you show them you're a human being and you look them in the eyes
[02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:34.300]  and you make that contact with them.
[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:35.300]  You also show them the authority.
[02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:36.300]  Exactly.
[02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:38.300]  You show them that we're a human being.
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:41.300]  You're just a criminal in a monkey suit.
[02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:44.300]  That piece of badge doesn't mean jack crap, buddy.
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:47.300]  I come with the authority of common law and the republic.
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:48.300]  Yeah.
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:49.300]  And we have rights within us.
[02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:51.300]  We just have to realize them and use them.
[02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:52.300]  We don't use them.
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:53.300]  They're going to go away.
[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:56.300]  And they're going away because everybody's happy with just being padded down at a football
[02:18:56.300 --> 02:18:57.300]  game right now.
[02:18:57.300 --> 02:18:58.300]  But we're trying to change that.
[02:18:58.300 --> 02:18:59.300]  And it is changing.
[02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:01.300]  And I see beautiful things coming ahead.
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:03.300]  And Luke, we told people that was coming.
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:04.300]  It's total TSA takeover.
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:08.300]  Yeah, it's going to get worse and worse and worse until we stand up until we do something.
[02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:10.300]  And I do believe in positivity.
[02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:12.300]  I do believe we could get a lot of good things.
[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:13.300]  I agree.
[02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:16.300]  Listen, we're winning on Gardasil's now the big issue, the Fed.
[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:19.300]  But so many people that really wake up at first think we're doomed.
[02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:20.300]  Yeah.
[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:21.300]  They don't understand.
[02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:22.300]  It's got to get bad for it.
[02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:23.300]  It's good.
[02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:24.300]  There's a lot of depression.
[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:26.300]  There's a lot of, again, fear because you're afraid of what's going to happen.
[02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:27.300]  People are paranoid.
[02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:30.300]  But once we get rid of that, once we lose all that negativity.
[02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:31.300]  You just got to commit.
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:32.300]  Yeah, anything could happen.
[02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:33.300]  Nothing is impossible.
[02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:35.300]  And that's what Roseanne Barr told me.
[02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:36.300]  We are winning.
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:39.300]  And I told her we just have to realize that and we will be winning.
[02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:40.300]  And it's all in our hands.
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:41.300]  It's right in front of us.
[02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:42.300]  Well, that's why they're getting ready to throw Obama to the wolves.
[02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:43.300]  Yeah.
[02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:46.300]  We have the true potential within ourselves to do anything in this world.
[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:47.300]  And it's us just believing it.
[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:49.300]  It's us going out there and doing it.
[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:50.300]  I mean, that's what made me start.
[02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:53.300]  We Are Change is the idea of being the change before the world.
[02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:54.300]  Stay there.
[02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:55.300]  We got to get some headphones for you.
[02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:56.300]  We're going to take some calls.
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:20:00.300]  And a bunch of other issues with Luke Radowski of We Are Change, GCNLive.com.
[02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:06.300]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security,
[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:07.300]  what would it be?
[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:12.300]  That's easy, Bill. I'd head straight to soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:13.300]  Soupbeansurvival.com?

[02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:28.300]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:29.300]  Absolutely, Bill.

[02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:44.300]  No way, Bill.
[02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:46.300]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:50.300]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.

[02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:35.300]  The globalists are scared. They've overreached.

[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:38.300]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.
[02:22:56.300 --> 02:23:01.900]  They're poisoning the water with fluoride.
[02:23:01.900 --> 02:23:04.060]  They're spraying the air with heavy metals.

[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:56.080]  Your water.

[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:31.880]  Take it on the New World Order, Luke Radowski here with us in studio and there he is, willing
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:38.880]  to go for broke in The Running Man, the number one television show in the whole wide world.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:40.720]  And who loves you and who do you love?
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:44.000]  The Running Man brought to you by the Department of Justice.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.800]  It's incredible that everything in that movie is now coming true.
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:51.600]  Telescreens, big cis messages on coffee cups, I mean it's like they've gone and gotten the
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:57.520]  worst comic book of a police state, complete with a weird, you know, lady that looks like
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:02.320]  a man up there and there clearly are the terrorists and it's coming out, the government's bringing
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:07.160]  in the drugs confirmed and the government's bringing the guns out and I mean how can people
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:10.280]  not believe in false flag terror with all the stuff they've seen, Luke?
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:11.280]  I mean it's impossible.
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:14.200]  I mean we try to dumb it down to them as much as we can.
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:17.640]  We have not only all these celebrities calling for it but family members, rescue workers,
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:20.960]  survivors and then we go up to the people who are supposed to investigate it like Thomas
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:24.280]  Kean and Lee Hamilton and every time we ask them a question they have the light on our
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:28.120]  face or they run away like little cowards and that's what we've been proving to people.
[02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:32.440]  Simple questions about Philip Zellicow writing the outline before the commission was even
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:34.240]  started or Bush insider.
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:35.760]  It was a total cover up.
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:38.800]  We don't know the whole truth behind that 11 and we deserve to know it because it's still
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:39.800]  affecting us today.
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:41.320]  This is why we still have the pat downs.
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:46.440]  This is why we have the TSA, Gropin everybody and it's the key to getting freedom and liberation
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:47.440]  for all of us.
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:52.280]  10 years later, exactly 10 years later if things aren't getting less police day, they're
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:53.720]  getting more and fast.
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:56.720]  Luke do you agree with me that they're clearly building up and prepping everybody for a new
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:25:58.160]  stage terror attack?
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:00.640]  I mean that's why it's so important to expose not 11.
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:04.200]  The more we expose not 11 the less likelihood of another terrorist attack that's going
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:05.200]  to happen.
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:06.200]  And they're mad.
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:07.200]  They're little favorite tools in trouble.
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:10.240]  Oh yeah, I mean they've been using it throughout history but now because of the internet we're
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:14.160]  able to expose it, we're able to show people what really happened in history and showing
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:17.880]  a true side of the story from the survivors, from the rescue workers, from real people
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:21.600]  who are involved in it instead of the people who just write the history books.
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:24.560]  And we're changing that right now and it's a beautiful time to be alive and we can do
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:25.560]  anything man.
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:26.560]  It's insane.
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.400]  Well you probably didn't see the nightly news last time but we had Kurt Haskell on
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:31.400]  with Breaking News.
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:37.440]  He's been going to the underwear Christmas Day Mutalib bomber events and he says Mutalib
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:38.840]  has been threatened or tortured.
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:40.600]  He won't let his lawyers defend him.
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:41.720]  He's talked to the lawyers.
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:43.400]  He fired and the new standby lawyers.
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:45.040]  They're like, no, no, we know it's government set up.
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:46.040]  Oh yeah, no surprise.
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.480]  Look what happens with the Nautilemma Commission all based on torture that the CIA destroyed
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:52.040]  all the tapes afterwards.
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:55.600]  So the whole Nautilemma Commission, the whole investigation is based on torture evidence
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:58.360]  that nobody has even ever seen and is already destroyed.
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:01.320]  I mean, who knows if they even set it under torture?
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:02.880]  Yeah, it makes no sense.
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.480]  It's their word and we have to believe them supposedly but that, it can't stick up anymore
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:08.480]  man.
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:12.400]  Well, what about this new hoax where they're saying 9-11 truth is dead?
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:16.000]  I've been, I've been seeing this when all I see is it's like we won, everybody's kind
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  of moving on.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  Yeah.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  I mean, I see the opposite.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.480]  I mean, we woken up a lot of people together with the movies you put out and what we've
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:26.400]  been trying to do, we've been trying to reach as many people as we can and we're reaching
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.760]  more and more and more people every single day.
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.640]  For people that don't know, you've confronted hundreds and hundreds of globalists with just
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:35.320]  real questions and made the news over and over again.
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:39.720]  Globalists, people involved in 9-11 confronting the lies of 9-11 like Giuliani and Joe Biden.
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:41.320]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:42.760]  The journalists are not doing their job.
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:46.160]  We're doing it for them and when we go up with questions about 9-11 truth, these people
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:50.960]  like Larry Silverstein pretty much are inviting conspiracy theories by not answering any
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:55.160]  other questions and looking guilty as you could just from a simple question.
[02:27:55.160 --> 02:28:00.320]  Just it's, it's so, it's so perplexed how this could, they could just get away with
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:01.320]  it.
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:02.320]  It's, it's out there for everybody to see.
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:06.640]  Well, you commit a crime so big that it threatens to bring down the entire structure.
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:07.640]  That's how they do this.
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:10.800]  And you see it in their faces as soon as we ask them a question about 9-11 truth or we
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:13.120]  ask them about their involvement in the 9-11 events.
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:14.360]  You see their face turned white.
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:15.360]  You see them stumble.
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:16.360]  You see them shaking.
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:17.360]  And you see them running away.
[02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:19.280]  I mean, when I talked to Hamilton, he was shaking.
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:20.280]  The guy was literally shaking.
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:23.040]  No, no, I've seen the videos with a lot of these guys.
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:24.400]  You come up, they're not shaking.
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:25.800]  You ask the question and it starts.
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:26.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:28.240]  You got the jittery going on.
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:29.240]  You got them running away.
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:33.200]  I mean, I can't even tell you how many times, like just, it's just absurd.
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:34.200]  Things happen.
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:35.440]  I'm, I try to be polite.
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:37.200]  I try to look them in the eye, shake their hands.
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:40.920]  And as soon as I asked them the question, security grabs me by two arms and drags me
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:41.920]  out the event.
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:42.920]  I mean, it's just the question.
[02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:44.520]  If we're wrong, tell us we're wrong.
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:45.520]  Prove it to us.
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:46.520]  But they haven't done that at all.
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:47.520]  All they want to do is run away.
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:50.920]  You're like six of the ten have said it's a fraud and criminal cover up and, you know,
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:53.120]  we'd like to know about this document and that document.
[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:54.600]  How did the passports survive?
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:58.000]  Why were US troops standing by to invade Afghanistan the days before?
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  Why did all this happen?
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.680]  And then they just totally freak out.
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:02.320]  Or what about the bin Laden thing?
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:03.320]  Oh, yeah.
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:04.320]  That's, that's just totally absurd.
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:08.640]  I mean, I was there when the news broke outside the White House and people were celebrated
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:10.400]  because they thought it was Saddam Hussein.
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:12.080]  I mean, that's how dumbed down the public.
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:13.080]  That's right.
[02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:14.560]  You shot that video with him going, we killed Saddam.
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:16.720]  They don't even know it's a brown guy.
[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:17.720]  He's dead.
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:18.720]  Yeah.
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:19.720]  Just a brown guy.
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:21.920]  I mean, that was liberals out there going, I'm feeling good for America right now.
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:24.880]  And it's because of our ignorance and compliance that they're getting away with this.
[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:25.880]  And that's what we're trying to show.
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:29.040]  It's the education of the people that could really change things in this world.
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:30.760]  And that's what we're trying to do here.
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:33.200]  And you're doing an excellent job at it, man.
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:36.320]  Well, they invest their identity in Obama.
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:38.840]  And so finally he's got to win.
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:40.920]  Finally something good's happening.
[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:42.120]  Finally, you know, this is so exciting.
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:47.280]  We're going to go to break and come right back with Luke Radowski, our guest and your
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:49.440]  phone calls and a smattering of key news.
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:50.440]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:51.760]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:54.200]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.200 --> 02:30:05.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network, a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:09.160]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:11.720]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:15.520]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:17.120]  your health and your own family.
[02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:20.120]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:22.480]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:26.720]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:28.720]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:32.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.160]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:39.320]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:40.840]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:40.840 --> 02:30:43.480]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:47.720]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:52.400]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:55.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:58.880]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:01.920]  That's End of America 3.com.
[02:31:01.920 --> 02:31:06.560]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:10.520]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my
[02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:13.280]  listeners to do three things right away.
[02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:15.680]  Number one, study the past.
[02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:17.960]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:22.800]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:25.640]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:29.720]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:34.680]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves,
[02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:38.800]  warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:42.120]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:31:42.120 --> 02:31:46.600]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:50.640]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in
[02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:51.640]  half.
[02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:56.200]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:56.200 --> 02:32:01.920]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:05.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:08.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:13.160]  As we're finishing off this agenda, there'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:14.160]  at home.
[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:19.320]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:20.320]  shots.
[02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:25.240]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:28.440]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:34.280]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:35.280]  world government.
[02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:38.840]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches.
[02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:41.640]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:32:41.640 --> 02:32:47.720]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:48.720]  of the Republic.
[02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:53.600]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[02:32:53.600 --> 02:33:20.600]  We're watching online right now in Super High Quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:24.960]  Okay, I want to go to Laura, who's been holding patiently.
[02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:28.560]  I want to get to Joe, and James, and Jay, and Steve.
[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:30.760]  We're going to get to everybody.
[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:36.640]  In fact, let's go ahead and go back to Laura in California.
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:40.040]  You're on the air, Laura, with Luke Radowski and Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:41.040]  Go ahead.
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:42.040]  Hi, Alex.
[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:52.840]  So, anyway, we were talking about the TSA, the proms at the high schools and stuff.
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:53.840]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:57.280]  You called in about an hour ago, and then you were on hold, and I went to you for new
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:33:59.280]  listeners, and you were saying something happened at your school.
[02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:00.280]  We were going to break.
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:01.280]  I said, I'd get back to you later.
[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:02.960]  So, something happened at your school.
[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:03.960]  Go ahead.
[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:04.960]  Yeah.
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:11.960]  Well, between all the vaccine mandates and all the games are playing there, and then
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:18.200]  along with the drug searches, and my senior who was graduating in March or May of this
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:25.640]  year, she just casually mentioned to me that the drugbugs came in, and they were told they
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:33.560]  had to leave the classroom, and I'm like, oh, no, so it doesn't even face her, which
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:38.120]  just stresses me out, and then she's like, we left the classroom, and we were told we
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:43.640]  could not take any of our personal items, nothing, and then they stepped us out into
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:48.920]  the courtyard, and if we were to look into the classroom while they were doing a search,
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:52.840]  they would pull us aside or yell at us and tell us we couldn't look inside the classroom.
[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:55.040]  Yeah, no, this is basic prisoner training.
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:35:00.360]  Not only are there fourth amendments being violated with no due process or probable cause,
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:01.920]  you're guilty of the prison innocent.
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:07.360]  Now, God knows what the police and TSA caught constantly planting stuff, stealing.
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:12.000]  There's like five articles of TSA reportedly raping, killing, stealing, and not even getting
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.000]  in trouble.
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:17.200]  Today, then if your daughter looks in, she gets in trouble, and they used to do drug
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:21.120]  dogs and sweeps when I was in high school for part of my high school in Dallas, and
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:23.880]  I knew the cops were dealing drugs, I'd get in their face, I'm like, dude, I don't use
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:28.840]  the drugs, you're shelling people, and they would get so angry and pull me in and slam
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:32.360]  my head in the wall and let me know, you know, buddy, you better keep your mouth shut.
[02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:36.680]  But again, the drug dealers have to do this, so you don't know that they're the ones dealing
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:37.680]  the drugs.
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:42.160]  But let me ask you because you live in California, and then get Luke Radowski's take on this.
[02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:47.400]  This is happening with a whimper, not with a bang, I mean, I myself this morning in the
[02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:54.480]  shower was going, man, why aren't I more angry that in California, we got mad at Rick Perry
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:57.160]  for lying and saying it's the law, you got to take shots.
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:00.680]  Now in California, they're just saying, we're going to give your kids the Gardasil shot
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:05.440]  without parental consent, the bill is on the governor's desk, and they spend it like, well,
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:09.940]  the kids have the choice as young as six or nine, depending on which policy it allows
[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:11.440]  them to follow.
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:16.680]  But a child, you can't say, well, the child consented to drinking Jack Daniels at ten
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:19.720]  years old, you get contributing to the frequency of minors.
[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:23.240]  They don't as a child have the right to give their consent.
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:27.400]  Or well, the kid got in my car, you know, the twelve-year-old did, so it's okay, no,
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:29.600]  that's kidnapping, even if they consent.
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:33.280]  This is the government kidnapping your kids and telling parents, we're going to kill their
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:35.400]  babies without you knowing.
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:37.520]  We're going to now shoot them up without you knowing.
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:40.000]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.080]  Give me your take on that, Laura.
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:48.280]  Well, here's the thing, and it's really, you know, you have to find out why.
[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:54.760]  And it's, like you've said, it's just mind control game and, you know, learning, like,
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:59.920]  if you read, and it's a huge book, but it's tragedy and hope and understanding why all
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:02.600]  this is happening so far out in the West Side.
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:05.920]  This is dog training, this is submissiveness training.
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:08.000]  We are being taught how to be prisoners.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:13.080]  Everything in America now is about learning your scum, you don't have any personal space,
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:16.360]  the government's going to put their hands on you, we're going to taser you, we're going
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:20.840]  to take your blood, we're going to grab your genitals, that's the way it is, we're protecting
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:21.840]  you from the terrorists.
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:25.680]  And then you go research, the government's shipping the drugs in, the guns out and putting
[02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:26.960]  bombers on planes.
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:27.960]  They're terrorists.
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:31.480]  Look, we have terrorists and a bunch of control freaks that work for them.
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:32.720]  Alex, this doesn't surprise me.
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:36.440]  I mean, I went to high school in Brooklyn and randomly, you know, once a week they would
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:40.880]  put up metal scanners, pat you down, search you, go through your lockers without any permission
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:41.880]  at all.
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:46.280]  The NYPD even has its own school task force that randomly comes into a different school
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:47.280]  and searches.
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:51.360]  And Hollywood sold the gangster culture, the government ships the drugs in, it's all been
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:52.360]  planned.
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:55.880]  It takes away their cell phones, takes away their iPods, takes away everything from them
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:59.000]  and gives them detention for having a phone in school.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.960]  And the reason probably why they don't want the phones is because you could quickly turn
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:03.520]  on the camera and expose them.
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:08.200]  But this is also interesting what's happening in New York City, the NYPD is actually sending
[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:12.360]  undercover detectives as spies into Brooklyn College.
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:16.480]  One of my colleges I used to go to is sending spies to listen into the teachers and the
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:20.920]  students and the student clubs to get information out of them, the NYPD intelligence office
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:25.560]  that is closely connected with the CIA and at the same time, the officers all over the
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:26.560]  world.
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:29.120]  The NYPD is really like its own branch of the CIA.
[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:33.240]  They use the NYPD to go over the 2nd Amendment in other states and that's the thing.
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:38.520]  The Pentagon, the Army, the police are now being turned as weapons against the people.
[02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:39.520]  Where's the limit?
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:43.400]  It's a local police department that's sending officers all around this country, all around
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:47.320]  the world to entrap people, to spy on people, to get them into trouble.
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:48.920]  These are political commissars.
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:53.120]  Big brother 1984, nothing's new, they're all out there watching us and it's pretty insane
[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:56.080]  that they would send undercover agents to a school.
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:58.640]  Well of course they're watching us, they know they stage 9-11.
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:02.520]  So listen, what's going on and what students are talking about, I mean this is what they're
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:03.520]  using.
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:07.120]  No, they know they stage 9-11, they know they're shipping the narcotics in and they
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:08.480]  know we're waking up.
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:11.440]  So they've got to get all the power in their view or go to prison.
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:14.680]  Yeah, anybody resisting them, especially the professors, I mean thank God.
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:18.040]  What do you think of this though that the system has nothing left to lose now?
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:20.320]  They've committed so many crimes, they're going for full broke.
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:23.680]  I mean we have nothing to lose either but the chains around our wrists so we have to
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:25.200]  make a stand as well and stand up.
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:27.600]  You got some good news you're going to point out?
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:30.520]  Good news as far as the Adam Kokesh case?
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:32.960]  Well you were saying they got some good news and then I interrupted.
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:34.960]  I don't know about that.
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:36.680]  But the point is a lot of good things are happening.
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:38.640]  Hey listen, Laura, I appreciate your call.
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:44.440]  You got Kokesh, the dancing at the Jefferson Memorial, not allowed.
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:45.440]  Yeah, not allowed.
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:47.360]  Even moving your body, la la la.
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:50.400]  Well he had a court day today and the charges were dropped against him and the other five
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:54.640]  dancers so they were actually facing prison time and all the charges were actually dropped
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:56.360]  so they're not facing anything of course.
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:59.240]  Yeah but why would the system try to put him in jail?
[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:02.160]  Why would they try to put a guy in jail for live for videotaping cops?
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:04.360]  I don't know man, I mean it's just ridiculous.
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:06.200]  Yeah but that is hardcore criminal.
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:07.200]  It is.
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:09.840]  I mean it's one thing if the cops wrongfully arrest you for videotaping because they're
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:10.840]  scared of what you take.
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:11.840]  That's bad.
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:15.480]  But like going nowhere, the state is coming to support the county, we want life in prison
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:16.480]  your honor.
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:17.480]  Yeah.
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:18.480]  And these people feel good.
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:19.480]  They smiled.
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:20.480]  That's all that is.
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:21.480]  Yeah we want life in prison.
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:22.480]  Yeah we're hardcore.
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:24.960]  And we're gonna forcibly inject your kids.
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:28.200]  People need to get involved with the local legislator and change his local wiretapping
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:29.200]  laws in Illinois.
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:30.200]  I mean it's just incredible.
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:31.200]  Yeah but I've read the law.
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.960]  It says it's not a public place though.
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:37.800]  Exactly and they interpret it as they want so it's their interpretation of the law so
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:41.600]  hopefully he gets a good lawyer, fights this and sets a president for other people in Illinois
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:45.120]  who will be filming cops and won't have to face the same ordeal that he's facing right
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:46.120]  now.
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:47.120]  You're absolutely right Luke.
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:50.600]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:54.880]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in South Carolina holding like a true trooper.
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:56.400]  You're on the air Joe.
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:02.680]  Yeah in South Carolina, back to the vaccine issue.
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:05.760]  They won't let your kids go to school unless you get the chicken pox vaccine.
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:06.760]  To hoax.
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:08.360]  I've checked that there's no laws.
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:15.000]  They lie to you sir and say it's a law, it's a policy and they've got to give you a waiver
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.280]  but there's no law you've got to get the waiver.
[02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:18.280]  Right.
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:21.480]  Hey Jaren you brought it in yesterday and I went to show it on TV last night and I left
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:22.480]  it in this stack.
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:29.600]  Well you repull USA Today from 2007 you dug up where Perry said it's the law and quote
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:30.600]  ordered it.
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:32.200]  Now he says oh he just recommended it.
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:36.760]  Now he got on the news and said it's the law and now you notice it's not the law.
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:40.160]  So I'm telling you they're lying to you which is another level of how criminal they are
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:41.160]  sir.
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:44.440]  I'm sorry go ahead tell me about what's going on in South Carolina.
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:48.680]  Years ago and we had a son who has autism and Tourette's and at the time I was like
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:51.960]  I don't want to get any shots and he won't be allowed to go to school if it's the Department
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:55.520]  of Health in the state that said that and they're like if you don't have this form showing
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:58.800]  that he got the vaccine he won't be able to attend the school.
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:05.000]  So again I wasn't aware at the time and I just went along with it but I look back on
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.960]  it now and I feel horrible about it.
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:09.520]  By the way that's a criminal conspiracy.
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.840]  What I was to get on the news on the radio and authoritatively on the news say everyone
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:21.920]  who's not inoculated must show up at a vaccination day at Zilker Park from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. or
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:25.440]  you will not be allowed in school and then you will be arrested for truancy if you do
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:26.440]  not.
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:31.200]  This is what I hear on local news every year TV, radio, print show up at these injection
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:33.440]  centers or you will go to jail.
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:39.480]  Now that is a criminal racketeering hoax but everybody goes along with it.
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:40.480]  Everybody will.
[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:43.640]  You can even go out and hand the parents, this has happened in other cities, flyers
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:48.200]  saying here look here's the state exemption code and cops come over and say don't interfere
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:52.000]  with what we're doing with riot cops I've seen it on the news and will arrest people.
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  I mean you're literally going to victims look you don't have to take the shot and there's
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:00.080]  cops get back we're doing it I mean this this tyranny's been going on forever.
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:04.080]  It's outrageous lies and it's up that's why the truth is so important this piece of information
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:07.280]  I mean when I first came to this country they never gave my parents an option when I went
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:11.320]  to public school they said vaccinate them or you're not going to get into school at
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:15.720]  all and sadly I remember being forced to take these vaccinations something inside me made
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:19.760]  me not want to do it I was doing everything I could but they don't give you a choice that's
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:23.400]  why the truth is so important that's why you have to keep spreading the message and effect
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:24.520]  in local communities.
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:29.520]  And now we know what they're doing they are undoubtedly and literally hundreds of documents
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:35.400]  giving people delayed cancer injections it's viruses that go and pregnant themselves into
[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:41.000]  the cell DNA that are designed at certain hormone levels when hormone levels drop it
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:42.400]  kills you you die.
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:46.320]  In fact I have articles here today I didn't even get to them I'll get to them in the next
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:50.680]  segment for some more calls where they admit a doubling in cancer and another doubling in
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:55.840]  the next 15 years that UN is saying and and they're just throwing it in our face how they're
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:56.840]  doing it to us.
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:43:59.760]  Yeah no surprise of course they're sticking their hands down our pants and stage and
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:04.600]  terror attacks of course they're out of control because these this is a guild of psychos.
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:07.920]  Yeah people please get educated share this information with your brothers your sisters
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:10.840]  your family your neighbor because that's the only thing you have they're not giving you
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:14.360]  an option out there they're telling you what they want to do with you but you have another
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:18.400]  option the truth the waivers you need to know about this spread this message to everybody
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:21.520]  and don't be afraid to be who you are and spread this information they could change
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:24.800]  live they could it could save lives and it's all in your hands right now guys.
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:31.440]  Okay let's go ahead now and go to another phone call hey guys with the camera let me
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:35.160]  show you what I'm talking about see how I'm right here and there's negative edge right
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:39.520]  there see all that space right there see I mean it's not just that I'm not in the middle
[02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:45.160]  I'm completely on the other side in the camera shot right there I mean I'm completely I mean
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:49.160]  even if I try to swing around this way I don't understand I'm trying to figure out these new
[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:54.960]  systems we're running here let's go ahead and take another call here let's go ahead
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:45:03.120]  and talk to Steven Illinois Steve you're on the air go ahead Alex fittingly that I'm calling
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:08.200]  you right now the Fed just made their decision they're going to do four hundred billion dollars
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:13.200]  worth of treasury purchases and I've been trying to call you the last couple weeks because
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:20.360]  I've really wanted you to get Bob Chapman to break down the bond market because I believe
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:28.920]  that the people are mistaking safety with the markets the deepest liquid most liquid
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:37.480]  market in the world and until the bond market blows up which is going to happen I don't
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:43.520]  think that we're not going to see the evidence of anything really spiraling out of control
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:50.800]  yields actually just backed up on a 30 year down do about 3% and I think people are just
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:55.520]  buying but it's out of control and I would love Bob Chapman to be able to break down
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:00.520]  the bond market well by keeping interest rates low and doing all this they're driving people
[02:46:00.520 --> 02:46:03.840]  into the bonds and that's going to be the next thing to go down so I will bring that
[02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:08.080]  up to Bob Chapman I mean I've studied it it's very technical but basically we're seeing
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:12.840]  the beginnings of hyperinflation and people are running into these government securities
[02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:20.360]  as a hedge of protection what's your view on it my view is it's just that people are
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:26.800]  continuously running to it as a form of safety and they're they're mistaking it you know
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:33.800]  like it's liquid and it's they're able to shift around billions of dollars very easily
[02:46:33.800 --> 02:46:39.520]  without you know manipulating the market I traded in a 30 year treasury pit in Chicago
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:44.800]  when it was a an open outcry market and I can be the first one to tell you when that
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:51.840]  market goes down it is pandemonium and I've heard Peter Schiff say recently that there's
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:57.400]  not going to be a shift out of you know like people aren't going to start buying stocks
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:01.240]  because just because they're going to sell bonds he says they're pretty much pretty much
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:05.480]  just isn't going to be any bids and it's just going to get hands just going to get
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:10.520]  you know you know well we see we see a lot of institutions of people going into bonds
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:14.440]  but with the treasuries we see the Chinese buying less and less and the fellow reserve
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:20.080]  having to monetize a lot of it so it's a it's a it's a weird thing that's happening it is
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:26.920]  honestly it's mind boggling it's very hard to figure out but I think that when that market
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:32.720]  has its problem when that day comes and interest rates start to rise and they can't service
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:38.360]  the debt that's going to be when the hyperinflation you're talking about comes about and until
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:44.880]  that day happens I think we just move along with the status quo when it comes to the economy
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:53.760]  that's that's my view well the status quo is just a slow slide into depression but look
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:57.880]  here's something important for new listeners there's been a premeditated police state grid
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:03.640]  built for collapse that accelerated when they got rid of Glass-Steagall in the late 90s this
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:08.520]  whole thing is premeditated to the point of which we told you that the private banks would
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:14.360]  say okay give a private financial dictatorship over Europe have the euro turned into a banking
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:19.240]  dictatorship and then expand a bank of the world out of that to quote pay off all these
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:23.720]  derivatives and now it's being done I appreciate your call Luke what is it like for you to
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:27.560]  see them more and more coming out with announcements of world government I mean doesn't surprise
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:30.640]  me I mean they're going to be more blatant more out and open to it but that's why we
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:34.600]  have to do the opposite and expose them for what it really is and make people understand
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:38.440]  it's not a good thing just because it has new in it doesn't mean it's a good world order
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:42.480]  and we have to tell them it's a lot like the old world order where elites and the feudal
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:46.640]  system was intact where people and kings and elites ruled everything and told people what
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:51.240]  to do so I think it's it's not surprising at all but if they're if they're doing it there
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:54.080]  they're moving a little bit too quick and they're going to expose themselves as this
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:57.200]  happens and they are and they pretty much are and that's why so many people are waking
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:01.920]  up to it every single day well these psychopaths instinct is to amass power to quote protect
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:07.040]  themselves from from angry people that they've wronged but in every case the the the gilded
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:11.120]  cage they build for the public is the cage that ends up holding them yeah they love bragging
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:14.880]  about it like chief member divignon of the bill de berg group who said yeah we created
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:21.080]  the euro yeah sure and we made it to become a receivership arm for Europe exactly openly
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:25.280]  bragging in the interview that this is happening but it's it's interesting how they could brag
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:29.240]  but when you come up to them with a question I don't understand like because we they know
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:34.480]  that we know well no it's part of a disrespect for us but they're also scared of us and see
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:38.520]  this is scientific dictatorship they're on such power trips that's like we're in a petri
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:43.360]  dish they're putting the stuff in our water our food got their psychological warfare programs
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:46.480]  they've got all their minions that have sold out for a little bit of money or sold out
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:52.000]  for petty power and they're just moving forward scientifically and it's like they don't want
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.840]  to hear from yeah I remember talking to Vicente Fox former president of Mexico about the new
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:49:59.200]  world order the North American Union he's like yeah it's going to be intact in about
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:03.840]  10 to 20 years we're going to have a new world order you know North American Union openly
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:07.280]  bragging about it I don't know if he had a couple too much to drink but he was openly
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:12.640]  look I got to say this was as we got a break I know no one probably now who's done more

[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:48.080]  from the american dream great research blog that links to the world health organization and other
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:53.120]  mainstream reports billions spent on a cure for cancer yet cancer rates continue to explode
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:57.760]  they've doubled in the last decade along with diabetes and the un says with 12.6 million people
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:03.600]  with cancer each year 7.5 million die that it's estimated by 2030 so like 18 years from now
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:11.680]  that it will double again and it just gets crazier and crazier the number of cases has risen
[02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:21.840]  from 640 000 back in 1980 to 7.5 to 12.6 million i mean i say doubling it's just exponential luke
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:24.480]  i mean what are you i mean pretty soon just everybody has cancer the government's like we
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:30.480]  have shots it's not these you know it's and we love you yeah and and even you know some of my
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:34.640]  friends who are 20 years old are getting cancer and it's pretty surprising knowing that's that this

[02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:43.040]  the vaccines all the pust filled food that's genetically modified all the crap they're spraying
[02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:46.800]  in the air i mean what do you expect i mean and that's why it's so important for all why are they
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:53.520]  doing this seriously i mean listen listen walter mondale's daughter died uh at 51 along with uh
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:59.920]  with uh ted kennedy's daughter at 51 and that's long i mean listen a bunch of people in this office

[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:14.960]  insane knowing that's more and more people are contracting it and uh i don't know i don't know
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:19.440]  why they're doing it it's just it's just mind blowing like is there control freak murderers
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:22.880]  man yeah and you know deep down we all know this is not the way we want to live our life this is
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:26.960]  not the way we should be living our life well these people are murderers and i want to get that right
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:32.160]  out in the open you know the globalists aren't just at stage in 911 or shipping some guns to Mexico
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:38.240]  and look folks if you can't grow up and admit to yourselves that that there's been secret testing

[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:46.480]  i mean that's all admitted if you can't even admit what's admitted you're never going to
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:51.200]  have a chance against these people most of us are already walking dead they've already shaved a third

[03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:16.160]  germany i have the documents directly from walters presidential archive proving his secret
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:22.080]  meeting with the architects of nafta mr ruther was very aware of the global plan for deindustrialization
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:27.040]  of the west and that's why thirdly i started a statewide political party in michigan called the
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:33.120]  anti nafta party our stellar platform page exposes the architects of nafta at anti nafta party
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:38.480]  dot org and we are looking for a petition drive volunteers in michigan so even if the g lp dark

[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:56.400]  that's absolutely true dealing with these people and expanding on that um nafta and get are just
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:02:00.720]  political agreements to then merge us with the european union that's how they set up the european
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:05.680]  union was trade agreements people need to figure out how these guys are patient in what they do
[03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:09.920]  luke yeah they take their time with it and uh we actually talked to christopher dodd about
[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:15.120]  calling for the north you know the nafta super highway and all that stuff and and he actually
[03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:19.120]  didn't even know he voted for it so i mean these politicians don't even know what they're now they
[03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:23.200]  lie to you man that's like whenever gary hart was like i never wrote a letter document in a
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:27.600]  junior like well here it is and they're like oh yeah i did write that yeah i mean it wouldn't
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:31.680]  surprise me if these guys are just taking orders from the people who control them who knows what's
[03:02:31.680 --> 03:02:35.920]  really going on but they could play stupid whatever it is but it's up to us to go out there film them
[03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:40.320]  and get the real truth because remember the bbc reporter that went to change stanley and announced
[03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:44.720]  building seven and blood had fallen and we are changing england was talking to him or it's one
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:48.160]  of those groups who played the video and he was denying he was like i was like i took my son to
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:52.080]  the theater that day i remember i wasn't there and we're like dude you were you were anchoring all
[03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:57.520]  day yeah here's yo here's he goes and he like a cat caught with a canary in his mouth he goes
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:03:03.040]  i do remember yes i've got to go now excuse me he actually know he actually said on record he was
[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:07.440]  like well it looks like you guys are insinuating there was a conspiracy and based on what i just
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:12.400]  saw i think you guys are right so this is this is his exact words that he said in the youtube video
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:17.600]  exactly but why would he first then try to you know deny it yeah who knows i mean the other
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:21.520]  journalist uh jane stanley got confronted i heard she ran into a closet ran away from the
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:26.160]  we are change uk guys another guy the head of visor consultancy that ran the drills the exact
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:30.880]  buses and trains head he ran and hid in the closet no surprise they always run away i mean
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:35.920]  but that's like run run run run away run run quickly all right thank you so much caller for
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:39.520]  measure again i'm sorry to everybody else but i had to give the callers that have been holding
[03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:46.880]  for eons uh i'll be back tonight seven o'clock central time on info wars nightly news and we
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:51.440]  do have andrew wakefield uh in studio but we're going to get into those this hoax that they say
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:57.280]  there's been no adverse reactions from Gardasil uh there's water isn't blue and grass isn't green
[03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:01.520]  and we're going to show all those lies but we're also going to show the hoax when they said that
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:06.640]  wakefield been discredited the opposite has now happened it was another hoax i mean these people
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:12.000]  just like wmds in iraq just like passports surviving on 9 11 and being found they're all
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:16.240]  about the big lie and once the media commits to the lie they're always going to defend it
