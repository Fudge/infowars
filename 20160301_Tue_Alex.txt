[00:00.000 --> 00:04.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we're cutting in at the start of the show because this is so important
[00:04.680 --> 00:08.920]  I am in contact with Trump insiders, not just with Roger Stone
[00:09.240 --> 00:15.520]  There is massive election fraud happening all over the country in Super Tuesday against Trump including here in Austin, Texas
[00:15.600 --> 00:21.320]  News Radio 590 that we're closely affiliated with has had scores of calls coming in and it's all the same thing
[00:21.680 --> 00:28.000]  It's flipping from Trump to Rubio in mass. We've got a special report. We're coming down after that to break it down
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.120]  The racial division flaring up in the United States
[00:32.400 --> 00:40.440]  Imposed on the average non-racist American by the self-anointed leaders of the African-American community based on the color of our skin
[00:40.800 --> 00:47.020]  Appears to be imploding whether it's Hollywood's Academy Awards the annual self-important
[00:47.160 --> 00:53.800]  Spectacle crashed by the cloud of racism lurking over its proceedings awarding Chris rocks blackhost matters
[00:53.800 --> 00:57.480]  Monologue style with ratings reaching an eight-year low
[01:08.680 --> 01:15.840]  We're MSNBC race Bader's central nothing less than a government funded megaphone for the media prostitutes
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.400]  Launching their New World Order division diatribe on a nightly basis
[01:20.400 --> 01:26.480]  Well, I think many people would like to see an African-American on the Supreme Court
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.880]  We don't really need to go into Clarence Thomas's background or his behavior Steve Watson writes
[01:32.880 --> 01:38.920]  What Sharpton and Bass are really implying is that they want to see someone nominated to the Supreme Court?
[01:38.920 --> 01:46.040]  Who will play the race card and will make decisions based not on whether or not they're consistent with the US Constitution?
[01:46.040 --> 01:53.840]  But based on the color of his or her skin indeed Justice Thomas recently asserted that the nation is far too obsessed with racial
[01:53.960 --> 02:01.560]  Differences prompting liberals to hurl racist slurs while others implied that the black judge was himself being racist
[02:02.120 --> 02:08.120]  MSNBC's Rachel Maddow blog responded to Thomas's speech by attempting to argue that more race
[02:08.440 --> 02:14.480]  Consciousness was a good thing because nobody wanted to return to the 1960s Jim Crow era a
[02:14.480 --> 02:21.400]  CNN segment also implied that Thomas himself was racist for wanting to move on from race even being an issue
[02:22.040 --> 02:29.920]  Sharpton also suggested that Senate resistance to confirming a new justice is another sign that the Senate does not
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.960]  Consider Obama to be a legitimate president due to his race and now a major mouthpiece of
[02:36.280 --> 02:39.620]  Weaponized inequality has been relieved of her post
[02:39.620 --> 02:44.860]  Melissa Harris Perry, but I want us to be super careful when we use the language hard worker
[02:45.460 --> 02:48.340]  because I mean I actually keep an image of
[02:49.460 --> 02:55.700]  Folks working in cotton fields on my office wall because it is a reminder about what hard work looks like
[02:55.700 --> 03:02.660]  We have to create a safety net for poor people and when we won't because they happen to look different from us
[03:02.660 --> 03:11.700]  It it is the pervasive of ugliness was dismissed from MSNBC on February 28th due to these comments from an email
[03:11.740 --> 03:16.220]  She wrote I will not be used as a tool for management's purposes
[03:16.220 --> 03:20.100]  I am not a token Mammy or a little brown bobblehead
[03:20.300 --> 03:26.180]  Perry wanted to continue her platform of division in the glorification of New World Order policy
[03:26.180 --> 03:35.100]  Whether it was opiating the masses with the Obama administration's plan to install a government worker to oversee every child in America
[03:35.100 --> 03:40.140]  Believe it or not the deceptive black lives matter movement is a counterfeit movement
[03:40.380 --> 03:46.060]  Funded by billionaire George Soros and it's the brainchild of the New World Order establishment
[03:46.340 --> 03:51.660]  Intended to divide America and drive us towards their vision of a civil war
[03:51.660 --> 03:57.740]  The irony is that millions of Americans are descended from many races reason clearly
[03:57.980 --> 04:05.980]  dictates that all Americans should resolve and finally overcome these issues together and not as divided cheap to be led by the
[04:06.140 --> 04:10.420]  lunacy revered by the elitist social engineers since the
[04:10.900 --> 04:17.620]  1970s we were already making progress on equality without the help of genocidal eugenics touting psychopaths
[04:17.620 --> 04:22.420]  So much so that they had to intervene millennial generation
[04:22.620 --> 04:29.220]  Where is the grassroots movement of true American racial equality to counter the force-fed
[04:29.420 --> 04:33.540]  billionaire-backed black lives matter movement until that happens a
[04:34.260 --> 04:40.620]  xenophobic stupidity of racial division will slowly increase and your generation and future
[04:40.940 --> 04:45.260]  Generations will be completely consumed by the New World Order agenda
[04:45.260 --> 04:47.980]  John bound for info wars calm
[04:48.900 --> 04:56.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is super Tuesday massive election fraud against Donald Trump appears to be taking place from Ohio to Texas
[04:56.740 --> 04:59.420]  I'm your host Alex Jones. Trap yourselves in and get ready
[05:02.180 --> 05:05.380]  Shock pole Hillary could lose the Trump in Democratic New York
[05:05.380 --> 05:11.260]  That's right pulling that it shows Hillary Clinton could lose New York a Democratic stronghold to Donald Trump as the GOP
[05:11.260 --> 05:19.220]  Frontrunner gains broad support across party lines. The poll results from Democratic and Republican legislative races have surprised virtually all the leading
[05:19.220 --> 05:25.500]  Democrats who have endorsed Clinton while also energizing GOP leaders who are now warming up the Trump and the results found that Clinton has higher
[05:25.660 --> 05:30.140]  Negative ratings with New York voters than Trump despite the fact she served as a New York senator
[05:30.140 --> 05:36.740]  Some of the polls also found much stronger loyalty amongst Trump's potential voters and along Clinton's a finding that mirrors the record-breaking
[05:36.740 --> 05:43.940]  GOP turnouts and state primaries so far in other words Trump supporters will actually show up to the voting booth this past weekend
[05:44.060 --> 05:48.340]  Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions endorsed Trump during a campaign rally during the rally
[05:48.540 --> 05:54.940]  Sessions lashed out at the Trans Pacific Partnership and promised that amnesty will not be granted to the Legals during a Trump presidency

[07:59.420 --> 08:19.900]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:19.900 --> 08:32.860]  It is super Tuesday ladies and gentlemen and at about 8 o'clock in the morning my former
[08:34.020 --> 08:36.300]  Producer Mike Hansen called me
[08:37.740 --> 08:39.740]  And working with him for 20 years
[08:40.060 --> 08:44.980]  And he said you better tune into 590 news radio. They're having call after call after call
[08:44.980 --> 08:52.260]  Saying we're trying to vote for Trump, but it's it's flipping to Rubio a few of the callers said it was flipping to
[08:53.580 --> 08:55.580]  Cruz and
[08:55.820 --> 08:57.820]  Then by the time I
[08:58.740 --> 09:02.540]  Went to their website on my iPhone as I was exercising started listening
[09:02.540 --> 09:06.580]  I heard a few calls then I had to go back in get ready for the show come into work and
[09:07.740 --> 09:12.660]  Then CJ Odin cool last name one of our producers
[09:12.660 --> 09:19.060]  He tuned in when he was driving into work at about 845 and in just 15 20 minutes
[09:19.140 --> 09:24.260]  He heard four phone calls saying it now. I've called 590. I've talked to a few other people
[09:24.260 --> 09:27.140]  I'm trying to talk to their news director mark Caesar. I've been friends with the 20 years
[09:27.140 --> 09:31.020]  Of course, we've been on that station as well off and on over 20 years and
[09:34.180 --> 09:40.980]  We are trying to find out the exact number, but it's also now calls to other news radio channels, that's the dominant one
[09:40.980 --> 09:44.100]  It is calls into election judges
[09:44.100 --> 09:49.180]  We have reporters now going downtown to try to talk to some people and to talk to some exit polls
[09:49.700 --> 09:55.420]  And and get people's responses coming out because there's heavy heavy voting in this Super Tuesday primary
[09:55.700 --> 10:00.140]  Imagine in Austin, Texas with Bernie Sanders and Hillary and then Marco Rubio
[10:00.700 --> 10:04.420]  Donald Trump Ted Cruz and John Kasich and others
[10:04.420 --> 10:11.420]  Roger Stone was already scheduled again the consummate Trump insider and confidant of more than 40 years
[10:12.780 --> 10:14.820]  And then I mean these guys are like best buddies
[10:14.820 --> 10:18.540]  So they hang out and go out to dinner and play golf together on a weekly basis
[10:18.540 --> 10:23.900]  And I was just talking to Roger before the show. He told me a bunch of stuff. I can't repeat
[10:24.540 --> 10:31.620]  But he is joining us and he said Ohio is the big one. He said their sources their people on the ground. They're being flooded
[10:31.620 --> 10:35.700]  with calls and confirmations that in Ohio
[10:36.940 --> 10:40.500]  Where he has gone ahead of the governor
[10:42.100 --> 10:45.020]  Kasich that that they are stealing it from Trump and
[10:46.220 --> 10:48.220]  From another campaign source close to Trump
[10:48.580 --> 10:54.020]  Trump is really concerned right now and now they know why Carl Rove and the Republicans have been so cocky
[10:54.140 --> 10:58.620]  You don't just think they were gonna steal the election or try to from Bernie Sanders in an
[10:58.620 --> 11:05.060]  Iowa or in New Hampshire with six coin tosses one in the road to break the tire
[11:06.580 --> 11:11.980]  With 20 points win in New Hampshire, but Hillary gets the delegates most the delegates
[11:13.460 --> 11:19.260]  The fix is in the problem is if there's a tsunami and I've interviewed all the top election fraud experts
[11:19.860 --> 11:23.620]  We're gonna get a whole raft of them on obviously going into this election. We're lining that up now
[11:23.620 --> 11:30.700]  When there's a tsunami, they can't beat it and the fact that Trump in most states has double-digit leads over Rubio
[11:31.020 --> 11:38.860]  So they've now foisted into number two position with CNN MSNBC Fox News ABC CBS all of them behind him
[11:42.260 --> 11:45.780]  Despite that Trump has got double-digit leads and is gaining and
[11:46.980 --> 11:49.260]  if he doesn't win in almost every state by
[11:49.260 --> 11:53.460]  a large large portions because these states aren't going to take all
[11:54.300 --> 11:59.020]  You know, there's fraud going on and get ready for the attempt at a brokerage invention
[11:59.900 --> 12:04.900]  And that's why Roger Stone said he needs everybody the grassroots to really
[12:05.980 --> 12:09.180]  Focus on what he's about to cover in 15 minutes when he joins us
[12:09.780 --> 12:14.300]  17-18 minutes be technical at the bottom of the hour 33 after when we come in from break
[12:14.300 --> 12:19.420]  Because he's the guy that James Baker and the bushes brought in
[12:19.940 --> 12:23.700]  To be second in command of the recount in Florida
[12:24.020 --> 12:27.900]  He's the guy and he says he's ashamed of it and ashamed of George W. Bush
[12:27.900 --> 12:33.460]  And that's when he turned against him when they attacked Iraq sort of writing books against him at that time and to his credit
[12:33.460 --> 12:35.300]  He's done nothing but attack him for
[12:35.300 --> 12:39.740]  14 13 years over it, but he knows what he's talking about and
[12:39.740 --> 12:45.620]  And he said it is happening that means everybody's got to turn out for Trump
[12:45.620 --> 12:48.940]  And if you were going to vote for Carson or if you were going to vote for somebody else
[12:49.580 --> 12:53.100]  Or case it you're throwing it away and clearly the Chinese government
[12:53.820 --> 13:00.700]  The British government the former Mexican president all the elite publications the Davos group the Bilderberg group
[13:01.100 --> 13:07.580]  Are all saying Obama is saying the Republican leadership is saying Fox News is saying you can't have Donald Trump
[13:07.580 --> 13:09.380]  And
[13:09.380 --> 13:13.340]  They're making up all this clan garbage Hillary said oh my mentor Robert Byrd
[13:13.340 --> 13:17.060]  I love him so much when he died the former head of the entire Ku Klux Klan
[13:17.460 --> 13:20.620]  nationwide back when they were killing people and
[13:23.020 --> 13:25.820]  They play all these games even though he's now put down
[13:26.540 --> 13:31.900]  The clan three different times twice years ago another time they keep saying no say you're against it again
[13:31.900 --> 13:32.700]  Say you're against it again
[13:32.700 --> 13:37.340]  I can't tell you how many times the media stopped this because it doesn't work anymore. They'd say are you a racist?
[13:37.500 --> 13:41.540]  What do you think the Ku Klux Klan ice those questions all the time when I caught bribery at the Capitol?
[13:41.540 --> 13:43.540]  They asked if I was racist
[13:43.740 --> 13:48.620]  And at a certain points like saying do you rape your wife? You just don't even want to answer it
[13:48.620 --> 13:50.620]  You want to slap somebody upside the head?
[13:51.260 --> 13:53.260]  That's what these people are doing
[13:54.900 --> 14:00.300]  And it is amazing to see them pulling out all the stops but the story is up on drugs report calm
[14:00.300 --> 14:03.380]  It's the top middle column
[14:03.980 --> 14:10.380]  Top story on the middle column report Trump supporters in Texas see votes switched to rubio
[14:11.940 --> 14:16.260]  Callers to KLBJ report ballot irregularities
[14:16.260 --> 14:20.420]  And I would just point out news radio KLBJ for folks that don't know
[14:21.820 --> 14:23.820]  People voting for Trump
[14:23.820 --> 14:32.340]  And today's super Tuesday primary are seeing their ballots change to show a vote for Marco Rubio numerous callers flooded Austin base station
[14:32.780 --> 14:34.900]  LBJ this morning with reports of mistakes
[14:35.580 --> 14:40.900]  After they tried to vote for Trump and then it's got the tweets and people talking and 590s got an article out on it
[14:40.900 --> 14:47.300]  According to KLBJ computer freeze-ups and other glitches. That's what you know. I went early voted worked fine voted a
[14:47.300 --> 14:53.060]  Straight ticket on all the single Republicans that were running and then voted for a few people that were running as libertarians
[14:55.340 --> 14:58.820]  But I'm opposed Republicans are growing its Democrats I voted for them
[15:00.180 --> 15:05.420]  Trump supporters, but but no glitch no problem, but notice. Oh, there's a glitch and then it gives you something else
[15:05.420 --> 15:07.660]  That's the program laid in there. That's how it works
[15:08.620 --> 15:12.940]  Trump supporters previously accused the rubio campaign of stealing votes in Iowa after the
[15:12.940 --> 15:19.460]  Florida senator achieved a surprise third-place finish if rubio fails to secure a strong finish in today's primaries
[15:19.460 --> 15:25.260]  He could be forced to drop out of the race altogether. So this is a desperate attempt to keep him in
[15:26.740 --> 15:33.140]  Rubio super PAC has poured 1.5 million of its budget in the Texas and never to take delegates away from the home state favorite
[15:33.140 --> 15:37.060]  Ted Cruz and we're updating that right now with the info that Roger Stone gave us now I
[15:37.060 --> 15:42.060]  Need to add here that
[15:42.580 --> 15:49.780]  We're gonna cover this later the Koch brothers came out yesterday in the New York Times and in Town Hall and in BuzzFeed and
[15:49.940 --> 15:51.940]  in a bunch of other places and
[15:53.300 --> 15:56.100]  Said we aren't involved in the Republican primary
[15:57.740 --> 16:01.220]  That's like Clinton saying he's not involved with that woman Monica Lewinsky sexually
[16:01.220 --> 16:08.780]  And that they're not giving any money and they're out of this race for the Republicans well
[16:08.780 --> 16:15.500]  They're on record financing it the whole time trying to get certain people in they've given money to rubio and others
[16:16.180 --> 16:18.100]  So what?
[16:18.100 --> 16:20.180]  So I've got their quotes that's coming up as well
[16:20.420 --> 16:21.900]  They say Roger Stone is wrong
[16:21.900 --> 16:30.340]  But their top campaign operative has now gone over to run the rubio campaign because they give them all this money last Friday last Thursday
[16:30.340 --> 16:34.820]  They had a super PAC meeting in New York. That was in the news. The details were secret, but
[16:37.820 --> 16:41.500]  Stone Roger Stone is from New York. He knows all those operatives. They said, oh, no
[16:41.900 --> 16:49.860]  They're given 25 million other 50 million was getting pledged by others the 25 million suddenly shows up for rubio in Florida and other states and then the the
[16:52.060 --> 16:55.900]  Coke guys send their man in right as this is announced to run it
[16:55.900 --> 17:02.020]  Oh, no, they didn't give any money and there's no corruption and no election stealing going on
[17:02.020 --> 17:07.260]  And I am a Chinese jet pilot from Pluto and I believe in Santa Claus and I want to go to CJ
[17:08.100 --> 17:10.100]  Odin one of our great producers
[17:10.660 --> 17:15.180]  Who heard a lot of these calls today as well? We've called 590. We're trying to get the calls
[17:15.700 --> 17:20.980]  I think your podcast will be up soon. We'll be able to grab it and put some of the calls up on info wars.com
[17:20.980 --> 17:22.820]  We're gonna send some reporters over there in a little while
[17:22.820 --> 17:28.020]  But this is a big deal because this is being reported all over Austin another friend of mine's wife
[17:28.580 --> 17:32.780]  He called me and said no it happened to her. This is before I even had a story out
[17:32.780 --> 17:37.580]  I'm driving into work and I'm getting these calls. So I'm getting text. I'm getting calls. This is widespread
[17:38.740 --> 17:44.180]  CJ tell us exactly what you heard on news radio 590 KLBJ today. Well after leaving my polling place
[17:45.020 --> 17:46.940]  After voting this morning, I was running a little bit late
[17:46.940 --> 17:54.300]  so I heard more of the show than normal and there were at least three callers one from Georgetown and two from Round Rock that said
[17:54.620 --> 17:58.100]  They had indicated Trump on their I guess
[17:58.500 --> 18:03.860]  Computerized voting machine and by the time they got to review they noticed that their vote had been changed to Rubio and
[18:04.700 --> 18:07.100]  When I voted this morning, I noticed one anomaly
[18:07.100 --> 18:11.580]  I voted no on one proposition when I went to review it indicated
[18:11.580 --> 18:15.100]  I voted yes on all four propositions that I was that is incredible
[18:15.100 --> 18:22.180]  So I did review the presidential candidates. There was no change there, but it was awkward that right off the bat
[18:22.180 --> 18:27.420]  I noticed a problem where it indicated the wrong get it let you reverse. It did let me go back and each
[18:27.980 --> 18:30.780]  Caller reported that they were able to go back and fix it
[18:31.060 --> 18:34.100]  But it makes me worry about people that aren't able to go back
[18:34.100 --> 18:40.340]  I probably interviewed 30 of the top experts like Bev Harris and countless others and the diable fellow that went public
[18:40.340 --> 18:45.020]  To the Florida legislature and others and then that's what they say. There's different systems
[18:45.020 --> 18:50.140]  But it'll show it'll glitch and then change it and then you go back and think you've changed it
[18:50.140 --> 18:56.100]  But it's already been done and that's one of the most classic hack frauds. They do this doesn't sound too good CJ
[18:56.100 --> 18:58.980]  There's no way of going back and fully vetting code
[18:59.540 --> 19:02.660]  If it's been tampered with at least with dimple chads
[19:02.660 --> 19:08.140]  You can hire some people that can clearly see what paper has been meddled with and what hasn't
[19:08.140 --> 19:12.780]  Wow and and and again, you just heard part of the four-hour radio show
[19:13.420 --> 19:20.860]  Reportedly, this was just ongoing until the station that that is a very conservative with what they run with a very respected news radio channel
[19:20.860 --> 19:26.940]  It's one all sorts of national awards formerly owned by obviously the Johnson family now owned by emas and
[19:28.220 --> 19:33.660]  I mean they got so many calls and so many tweets and so many people and some of the reporters got called that they went
[19:33.660 --> 19:39.060]  But a story out saying it appears. This is really going on and again. It's not like they're getting glitches for everybody
[19:39.060 --> 19:44.580]  Oh, I voted for Rubio and it went for Trump. It's all I voted for Trump. It went for Rubio. I voted for Trump
[19:44.580 --> 19:51.180]  It went for Rubio. I voted for Trump. It went for Rubio. I voted for Trump. It went for Cruz and the same thing calls about the propositions
[19:52.060 --> 19:57.300]  Going the way of the establishment once and of course, they don't want to get in a rid of the state income tax
[19:57.900 --> 20:01.660]  Or or they they don't want to get rid of the state property tax
[20:01.660 --> 20:07.580]  Folks are saying that was flipping the wrong way. So it really looks like there is some manipulation going on
[20:07.580 --> 20:14.820]  What do you make of the reports coming in from Roger Stone that joins us in 13 minutes the massive election fraud taking place in, Ohio?
[20:14.820 --> 20:18.900]  I think it's what we feared, but we expected it. It's happened before I
[20:19.980 --> 20:21.980]  encourage everyone out there to
[20:22.780 --> 20:25.020]  either vote on paper or
[20:25.980 --> 20:27.980]  Thoroughly check their electronic
[20:27.980 --> 20:34.420]  Review form before they submit the ballot and that's why I became involved in elections and became a
[20:35.460 --> 20:40.260]  Alternate judge one time and I was down there at the main center where they were bringing in all the ballots from the precincts
[20:40.260 --> 20:45.620]  We would stack them in the right order and put them in the scantrons and almost everybody there were Pat Buchanan supporters
[20:45.620 --> 20:47.100]  It was the Republican primary
[20:47.100 --> 20:51.460]  And this was in 96 and I watched them with my own eyeballs
[20:51.900 --> 20:56.140]  It was like almost it was like 70 plus percent 80 percent depending on what stack
[20:56.140 --> 20:59.940]  For so I was looking at it was for Pat Buchanan and
[21:00.900 --> 21:07.900]  It didn't happen. It all went for basically Bob Dole and I witnessed it with my own eyeballs and we saw places like Nevada
[21:08.700 --> 21:10.700]  and places like
[21:12.380 --> 21:17.500]  Arizona where he was winning by huge majorities in the exit polls but still lost massively
[21:17.620 --> 21:23.940]  So they do not want these type of people in I wonder if they've got the wavos to steal this from Trump in front of everybody. I
[21:23.940 --> 21:30.700]  Think they do I think they do it's happened on a grand scale in Scotland. It's it's something. It's pretty widespread
[21:30.700 --> 21:36.980]  I think for an election this important it would not surprise me and it's a lot easier to hide being digital
[21:38.180 --> 21:40.740]  Unfortunately, well Trump is not going to put up with it
[21:40.740 --> 21:44.860]  And he has the money to if they still have paper ballots to pull them out and have them recounted
[21:44.860 --> 21:49.620]  But they're gonna call him a a shower pus and everything but you can't have him
[21:49.620 --> 21:55.140]  He's gonna have 40 leads and the next guy's 20 points and then have him lose
[21:55.140 --> 21:58.140]  I mean, they just can't do it when it's a landslide CJ. I
[21:58.780 --> 22:00.780]  Don't think so. I don't think so
[22:01.780 --> 22:06.340]  It could be trying to skew votes more in Cruz's favor. I I can't quite tell
[22:07.140 --> 22:12.580]  What adding to Rubio's counts gonna do for them? Well, if this doesn't tell people again
[22:12.580 --> 22:18.540]  David Knight wasn't for Trump Lee and Mac and it wasn't for Trump. I wasn't sure about it, but I do they were against him
[22:18.700 --> 22:25.460]  But now the whole world the Chinese Communist everybody says you can't have Trump and now it looks like fraud going on
[22:25.820 --> 22:29.260]  And Stone says it's coming in from all over the country. How could we not then?
[22:30.220 --> 22:37.220]  Be behind Trump. I mean, I get it. He says some wannabe tough guy stuff that I disagree with about torture about, you know, spying
[22:38.180 --> 22:41.500]  And you know, if he does a few more things like that, I'm gonna need him to reverse some other
[22:41.500 --> 22:48.380]  I'm gonna have a problem but still for whatever reason, they're scared to death of him on the 9-11 truth the vaccines the borders the sovereignty
[22:48.540 --> 22:55.140]  That the the Chinese and Indian and Mexican internal tariffs that are fraudulent tariffs that to make it impossible for us to have jobs
[22:55.140 --> 22:58.220]  I mean, they are scared of him because he's not perfect
[22:58.220 --> 23:02.740]  But he does want to turn the engine back on of the nation
[23:02.740 --> 23:07.020]  He doesn't want us going into cardiac arrest and he's not a globalist and they want to run the country
[23:07.020 --> 23:10.700]  And so they're scared to death of him. He's the most significant threat against Hillary Clinton
[23:10.700 --> 23:12.900]  I think that's the the big reason why you're gonna mess with Trump
[23:12.900 --> 23:19.300]  Oh, I don't think Ted Cruz or Rubio would say no chance people would accept that victory that Clinton is going to have over them
[23:19.300 --> 23:21.540]  If if they're the nominees or one of them is the nominee
[23:22.260 --> 23:26.460]  Trump is by far the popular favorite in the country. It's not just
[23:27.420 --> 23:33.060]  His politics but his business sense that people are rallying everyone on those voting for him except a few people for Cruz
[23:33.060 --> 23:35.060]  I know Democrats that are voting for Trump
[23:35.060 --> 23:40.780]  Absolutely, they're sick of it and what happens when they steal it from Sanders. They're totally stealing it. He gets 50 100,000 people
[23:40.780 --> 23:47.180]  Hillary gets a thousand and then magically she's winning everywhere bow loaning and you know, those folks need to give capitalism a chance
[23:47.180 --> 23:49.020]  They've been getting crony capitalism
[23:49.020 --> 23:54.940]  I want to invite the socialist who are going for Sanders because he says a lot of good things about spying and war in the banks
[23:54.940 --> 24:01.340]  Come over to Trump folks. It's never been more obvious. What's going on? I'm not mad at folks that don't want to be for Trump
[24:01.340 --> 24:05.020]  That's fine. I normally say presidential stuff's a diversion
[24:05.020 --> 24:10.300]  We want to run good candidates to educate people about liberty, but now we've got a real shot at this and
[24:11.220 --> 24:15.180]  They try to steal it from Reagan and 80, but the landslide was so big in the
[24:15.900 --> 24:21.340]  Super Tuesday and in the general election that they couldn't do it, but they're gonna fight him all the way down to the wire
[24:21.700 --> 24:24.740]  CJ, thank you so much for joining us. You're welcome. Thank you
[24:24.740 --> 24:29.460]  And if any of the other crew wants to pop in or any of the reporters want to come in and pop in with their view on this
[24:29.460 --> 24:31.460]  go ahead
[24:31.460 --> 24:35.180]  But I'm sure about Trump now, and I'm really concerned about his safety
[24:37.380 --> 24:43.060]  And I happen to know the inside baseball not from stone but from someone else that literally they did cut off Trump's audio
[24:43.060 --> 24:45.820]  He's decried before that, you know
[24:46.460 --> 24:49.860]  David Duke twice and I don't like him on his own before he was criticized
[24:49.860 --> 24:55.420]  I'm leaving the reform party because it's got David Duke Klansman in it. I don't want your nomination and they did it again
[24:55.420 --> 25:01.060]  They did that classic thing turn your audio off say David Duke and other white supremacist groups other groups
[25:01.060 --> 25:04.820]  He goes to Duke groups, you know, what groups? I
[25:05.980 --> 25:10.060]  Then I just come out and said yeah, I'd to cry it and then he says that is, you know internal folks
[25:10.060 --> 25:12.900]  He goes and next they're gonna say what do I think about this person or that person?
[25:12.900 --> 25:18.020]  Or they'll have bad people endorse me and then I'm gonna have to keep coming out and saying I'm sorry. No, I'm gonna look strong
[25:18.020 --> 25:19.340]  I'm done
[25:19.340 --> 25:21.340]  You know, I'm done
[25:21.740 --> 25:23.740]  And I had a little Freudian slug
[25:23.740 --> 25:26.500]  And I had a little Freudian slip there because I think that's dumb
[25:26.860 --> 25:32.100]  You know, he can sit there after a while and say hey, I'm not gonna sit there and you know to cry everybody because you tell me to
[25:32.100 --> 25:35.260]  I'm gonna be strong. I don't think that's the smartest move
[25:35.260 --> 25:40.620]  I actually agree with Ted Cruz when he says there's a few things you don't say you're with the Nazis the white supremacists
[25:40.620 --> 25:46.780]  You know the the Klan or the new black Panther movement or you know, I guess you're allowed to be in Mecca and La Raza
[25:46.780 --> 25:49.180]  They're just racial groups as well. I
[25:49.180 --> 25:53.900]  Do have a problem with Freudian slips as I just say what I'm really thinking. I just cannot control myself
[25:53.900 --> 25:58.060]  I'm totally teleprompter free and but that's more endearing that Trump
[25:59.300 --> 26:01.300]  Is is is so pigheaded
[26:01.940 --> 26:05.900]  I already did it. I did cry to him years ago. I'm gonna have to do this over and over again with everybody
[26:05.940 --> 26:10.460]  They could be pulling this stunt on me. I'm sick of it. The voters have figured it out. I'm done. I
[26:11.460 --> 26:14.580]  Just heard that Trump said that I but but the point is
[26:14.580 --> 26:21.340]  That that that maybe he's right. Maybe people are sick of everyone apologizing and totally sick of political correctness
[26:22.260 --> 26:24.100]  I'm inviting
[26:24.100 --> 26:25.420]  David Duke back on the show
[26:25.420 --> 26:31.020]  I'm not gonna have a two-hour so-called debate with him where he complains the whole time that I'm not letting him talk
[26:31.020 --> 26:33.020]  I'm gonna have a stopwatch. He will come on and
[26:33.580 --> 26:37.420]  I'll let him talk five minutes and then I'll talk two minutes. He's got a deal
[26:37.420 --> 26:41.740]  You know, he can have two-thirds more time than me and then some here every five minutes
[26:41.740 --> 26:44.660]  I will get two minutes with a stopwatch on television
[26:44.660 --> 26:50.660]  We will aim a camera at a digital stopwatch and then we can just you know debate discuss this whole situation
[26:51.660 --> 26:56.580]  And I'll be honest with you. I'm not gonna sit here and demonize David Duke because that'd be hypocritical
[26:57.380 --> 27:02.380]  Metsha and Laraza and and Al Sharpton and Black Lives Matter's leadership and
[27:03.380 --> 27:09.580]  That whole group is just as racist or more so than the Ku Klux Klan is today and they're just they're more violent
[27:09.580 --> 27:13.100]  They're out attacking white people and veterans and it's supposedly okay and shoot
[27:13.100 --> 27:20.180]  You know groups affiliated with them or shooting cops in the back of the head and it's the same mindless racial tribal garbage
[27:20.820 --> 27:24.620]  But the Klan was doing in the 40s 50s and 60s and some since then
[27:25.140 --> 27:31.140]  But David Duke has reformed himself 90% just like Lewis Farrakhan has changed a lot of what he has to say
[27:31.140 --> 27:34.620]  I don't want to fight with Lewis Farrakhan or David Duke. I think Lewis Farrakhan
[27:34.620 --> 27:42.100]  Is a more open serious more intellectual person than David Duke. I've talked to both of them and
[27:43.340 --> 27:45.540]  I
[27:45.540 --> 27:51.000]  Recoiled from Duke when I was interviewing him because he just seemed calculating and cold and spider-like and
[27:51.660 --> 27:57.620]  Farrakhan was like magnetic and I just wanted to hug him and it was like man. This guy is super super charismatic
[27:57.620 --> 27:59.420]  I was just like whoa
[27:59.420 --> 28:02.180]  Like superhero level. I'm not even saying that's a good thing
[28:02.180 --> 28:06.900]  I was like getting tears in my eyes and he was you know speaking and stuff. I was like whoa, dude
[28:06.900 --> 28:11.860]  This guy is like maybe maybe he's like the you know, what's the snakes name and
[28:12.620 --> 28:14.940]  The jungle book with no the eyes spinning
[28:15.460 --> 28:20.620]  But no, no, I mean, I think he genuinely cares about people in his angry and didn't like being kicked around when he was young and
[28:21.260 --> 28:26.180]  I can really identify with that but he says a lot of stuff. I disagree with but I had a real
[28:26.180 --> 28:33.900]  For him with him and he wanted to bring people together and said he'd grown and maybe maybe you know what I thought of this
[28:34.660 --> 28:39.260]  I'd pay for it in a really nice hotel somewhere in a conference room to videotape it
[28:40.180 --> 28:41.660]  myself
[28:41.660 --> 28:43.660]  loose Farrakhan and
[28:46.420 --> 28:48.980]  David Duke and I could be the mediator and
[28:49.460 --> 28:54.620]  Give each person equal time and not even really a debate but a discussion to really see what people thought about that
[28:54.620 --> 28:57.820]  People say what do you be associated with David Duker or or?
[28:58.660 --> 29:02.380]  Close for a con that's political correctness folks. I don't hold their views
[29:02.380 --> 29:05.740]  I don't get into a lot of this race politics tough, but but but I
[29:06.460 --> 29:11.820]  Would want to try to actually have a real open debate. They don't want us discussing
[29:11.820 --> 29:15.660]  They don't want us going to barbecues together. They don't want us going to church together
[29:15.660 --> 29:23.100]  You know, it's like diamonds and lace said yesterday. They don't want us actually speaking. That's what political correctness is by the way
[29:23.100 --> 29:29.100]  Roger Stone's coming up huge super Tuesday coverage before I go any further. We are ending the
[29:29.700 --> 29:34.180]  Leap year sale because we sold out of nine items just of the nutraceuticals alone
[29:35.300 --> 29:40.580]  But we are extending it for a super Tuesday sale for all items still in stock
[29:40.900 --> 29:43.820]  Whether it's water filters high quality nutraceuticals
[29:44.860 --> 29:50.820]  Non-gmo seeds books videos you name it info or store.com. It's extended. We're on the March
[29:50.820 --> 29:52.820]  The Empire's on the run
[29:53.700 --> 29:56.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:00.380 --> 30:03.380]  To Roman Catholic bishops who led a central Pennsylvania
[30:03.900 --> 30:11.380]  Diocese helps cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders over a 40-year period
[30:11.940 --> 30:16.620]  According to a grand jury report issued Tuesday reports Fox News the
[30:16.620 --> 30:23.180]  147 page report on sexual abuse and the local diocese was based partly on evidence from a secret archive
[30:23.580 --> 30:30.780]  Uncovered through a search warrant executed in August said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane who announced the findings these
[30:30.980 --> 30:37.420]  Predators desecrated a sacred trust and prayed upon their victims in the very places where they should have felt most safe
[30:37.420 --> 30:45.300]  Kane said in a statement just as troubling is the cover-up perpetrated by clergy leaders that allow this abuse to continue for decades
[30:45.300 --> 30:49.980]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case because some abusers have died
[30:49.980 --> 30:55.740]  The statute of limitations has expired and in some cases the victims are too traumatized to testify
[30:55.740 --> 30:59.940]  She said you can find more reports on info wars.com

[32:01.620 --> 32:07.700]  Thousands of years ago. There was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war
[32:07.700 --> 32:12.420]  Giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense
[32:13.020 --> 32:18.180]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[32:18.220 --> 32:25.700]  They had drums of their own air raid sirens, but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[32:26.380 --> 32:33.160]  Pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and
[32:33.160 --> 32:38.920]  Accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught with antroplex
[32:39.520 --> 32:42.440]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic
[32:43.480 --> 32:46.000]  concentrated herbs to create the basic
[32:46.720 --> 32:53.080]  Foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body discover why anthroplex has turned so many heads today
[32:53.080 --> 33:03.400]  It's time for us to take our bodies back in our own hands and it starts at info wars life comm with anthroplex
[33:03.400 --> 33:17.960]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:17.960 --> 33:25.200]  Richard Reeves with info wars calm. It is February 29th, 2016
[33:25.960 --> 33:32.360]  Tomorrow is super Tuesday, and we had a special guest come in today. We had Miriam Witcher come in
[33:32.360 --> 33:36.880]  She is the lady that became famous in Las Vegas when Donald Trump had an event
[33:36.880 --> 33:40.320]  She was the lady that became famous in Las Vegas when Donald Trump had an event
[33:40.320 --> 33:44.600]  She was the lady that became famous in Las Vegas when Donald Trump had an event
[33:44.600 --> 33:49.600]  Back in the fall and Donald Trump spotted her and brought her up on stage
[33:49.600 --> 33:53.080]  And she's jumping and shouting. I love Donald Trump
[33:53.080 --> 33:58.600]  I'm Hispanic and I vote for Mr. Trump. We vote for Mr. Trump!
[33:58.600 --> 34:03.600]  Yes! Mr. Trump! We love you!
[34:03.600 --> 34:07.600]  So what do you expect to see here with the folks here at UT?
[34:07.600 --> 34:10.600]  Well, first of all, I want to say
[34:10.600 --> 34:15.600]  Texas, I love you, and I'm here to support Donald J. Trump
[34:15.600 --> 34:18.600]  Hi ladies, are you going to vote tomorrow?
[34:18.600 --> 34:19.600]  Sorry, I'm on my way over there
[34:19.600 --> 34:21.600]  Hi, are you going to vote tomorrow?
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.600]  Hey ladies, are you going to vote tomorrow? Come here!
[34:25.600 --> 34:28.600]  Don't be scared, we are only fix the granted
[34:28.600 --> 34:30.600]  Look at these dehumanized trendies, they don't talk to anybody
[34:30.600 --> 34:31.600]  They have no social skills
[34:31.600 --> 34:32.600]  Are you going to vote tomorrow?
[34:32.600 --> 34:33.600]  Definitely
[34:33.600 --> 34:36.600]  Okay, darling, for who you are going to vote tomorrow?
[34:36.600 --> 34:40.600]  Marco Rubio
[34:40.600 --> 34:42.600]  You're in favor of Bernie Sanders here today?
[34:42.600 --> 34:43.600]  Yes, sir
[34:43.600 --> 34:44.600]  Are you going to be voting tomorrow?
[34:44.600 --> 34:45.600]  Yes
[34:45.600 --> 34:47.600]  So who do you like?
[34:47.600 --> 34:49.600]  Voting tomorrow?
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.600]  I don't know, I would basically vote for anybody besides Trump
[34:53.600 --> 34:56.600]  I'd rather go for Bernie Sanders because he's more of a human
[34:56.600 --> 34:58.600]  I voted for Bernie Sanders
[34:58.600 --> 35:03.600]  Bernie Sanders, so a lot of your comrades here on campus voted for Bernie Sanders, evidently, right?
[35:03.600 --> 35:05.600]  That is the impression I get, yes
[35:05.600 --> 35:12.600]  So I honestly thought this was a joke, like I didn't know you guys were actually Trump supporters
[35:12.600 --> 35:15.600]  This is hilarious to me, I really got to get to lunch
[35:15.600 --> 35:17.600]  Got to get to lunch?
[35:17.600 --> 35:19.600]  Okay, all right, lunch is definitely more important
[35:19.600 --> 35:21.600]  And Bernie will give you a free lunch
[35:21.600 --> 35:22.600]  What did you say, sir?
[35:22.600 --> 35:25.600]  I said you are too brown to vote for Trump
[35:25.600 --> 35:28.600]  So you think she's way off base, supporting Trump?
[35:28.600 --> 35:29.600]  Yes
[35:29.600 --> 35:31.600]  From what I heard, I just don't really like what he has to offer
[35:31.600 --> 35:36.600]  And the things that he says I don't think are very educated for who we need in running this country
[35:36.600 --> 35:38.600]  Tell us a couple of those things
[35:38.600 --> 35:42.600]  Well, let's see
[35:42.600 --> 35:47.600]  You know, there just seems so, I can't really remember specifically what they are
[35:47.600 --> 35:50.600]  I just told you I can cite many examples when he spewed hate
[35:50.600 --> 35:55.600]  Can you cite some examples of when he has spewed inclusivity towards people of color?
[35:55.600 --> 35:59.600]  The only thing Donald J. Trump has is loving his heart
[35:59.600 --> 36:01.600]  He's a humble man
[36:01.600 --> 36:03.600]  I love Trump
[36:03.600 --> 36:05.600]  I love Trump!
[36:05.600 --> 36:07.600]  Donald J. Trump!
[36:07.600 --> 36:09.600]  How much he paid you?
[36:09.600 --> 36:11.600]  When did you come to the United States?
[36:11.600 --> 36:16.600]  I came to the United States more than 35 years ago
[36:16.600 --> 36:18.600]  But I came here legally
[36:18.600 --> 36:24.600]  So why don't you vet the radical Christians who are coming to his rallies with KKK gear on?
[36:24.600 --> 36:26.600]  Well, I haven't personally seen that
[36:26.600 --> 36:30.600]  You haven't? Oh, you're interviewing for him or maybe you should do some research
[36:30.600 --> 36:32.600]  Well, I've been to quite a few rallies
[36:32.600 --> 36:35.600]  Who doesn't know anything about what's going on?
[36:35.600 --> 36:37.600]  Just, ah, go Trump!
[36:37.600 --> 36:39.600]  Sound like a voice recorder
[36:39.600 --> 36:41.600]  If someone's born in America, it doesn't make a difference
[36:41.600 --> 36:44.600]  They could still be a rapist or a murderer or something
[36:44.600 --> 36:47.600]  If they were born in America, come from an all-white family, it doesn't make a difference
[36:47.600 --> 36:50.600]  We stopped more people from coming over to add to that pool
[36:50.600 --> 36:53.600]  Any people, though, that wouldn't be just Mexicans
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.600]  Why don't you go into Mexico legally right now and tell me whether or not you're going to be taken in with loving arms
[36:58.600 --> 36:59.600]  So this is what happens
[36:59.600 --> 37:04.600]  If you go into Mexico, you're going to be taken into custody, held in jail for a long time, and then deported
[37:04.600 --> 37:07.600]  If you go to France and you go into legally, guess what's going to happen?
[37:07.600 --> 37:12.600]  What they mean is by the wall is we need to stop the drug coming through
[37:12.600 --> 37:15.600]  Because that happens, I go to the border all the time and I film that stuff
[37:15.600 --> 37:20.600]  Okay, so it's bad, you put up a wall, yes, people will come through, but there's a vetting process
[37:20.600 --> 37:25.600]  You know how many friends I know who are Mexicans, who joined the military, hold on, who joined the military
[37:25.600 --> 37:30.600]  And had to go through a proper protocol, through a proper procedure to gain that
[37:30.600 --> 37:31.600]  And they take that very seriously
[37:31.600 --> 37:36.600]  So when you see people come over here illegally and they don't do the right stuff and they're leaching off of our country
[37:36.600 --> 37:41.600]  Yeah, that's a spit in the face of the people that come over here and go through the immigration process the right way
[37:41.600 --> 37:45.600]  I think that the fact that he's gotten so much attention and so much support
[37:45.600 --> 37:51.600]  Faced off of faulty pieces of hope that he provides citizens with
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.600]  That report is up on infowars.com
[37:55.600 --> 38:01.600]  Liberal trendies freak out on Hispanic Trump supporter, and it gets worse
[38:01.600 --> 38:03.600]  And really they're anti-white
[38:03.600 --> 38:06.600]  And that's what MSNBC, the Democratic Party, has done
[38:06.600 --> 38:11.600]  They have created an anti-white sentiment, just as the Democratic Party ran the Klan, created it
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.600]  That didn't work, the Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act in the late 50s, Eisenhower
[38:16.600 --> 38:21.600]  And my grandfather was involved in that, elected a state office
[38:21.600 --> 38:26.600]  He switched from Democrat to Republican, some of his family got mad at him, they were, you know, Southern Democrats
[38:26.600 --> 38:28.600]  He said, listen, we're gonna have civil rights
[38:28.600 --> 38:31.600]  So the Democrats knew they couldn't beat it anymore, so they switched over
[38:31.600 --> 38:37.600]  And the Republicans said, okay, we'll do the Southern strategy, but it is just the ignorance of these people is incredible
[38:37.600 --> 38:41.600]  Here's the breaking news, it's up on drudgerport.com right now
[38:41.600 --> 38:46.600]  It's at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, Paul Joseph Watson's story
[38:46.600 --> 38:50.600]  And we can click on that, we've now updated it with information that Roger Stone has given us
[38:50.600 --> 38:55.600]  About huge evidence of fraud going on in Ohio, pouring in
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.600]  He is an election fraud expert, you know, helped run Bush's recount there in Florida
[39:01.600 --> 39:03.600]  So he knows what he's looking for
[39:03.600 --> 39:07.600]  And so we're gonna be talking to Roger Stone, the consummate, confidant, and Trump insider
[39:07.600 --> 39:11.600]  Here in just a moment about Super Tuesday from stonezone.com
[39:11.600 --> 39:19.600]  Before I go any further though, I promised you that I was not gonna extend the leap year sale past basically the start of the show today
[39:19.600 --> 39:21.600]  And we didn't
[39:21.600 --> 39:24.600]  And I was saying, you know, sometimes we extend stuff, but I said I wouldn't
[39:24.600 --> 39:31.600]  But I said we can't because 10 items, it's about to be 11 or 12, of just the nutraceuticals have sold out
[39:31.600 --> 39:34.600]  At infowars.com
[39:34.600 --> 39:39.600]  And a lot of other items are selling out, in fact I've never had a sale this successful and I know why
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.600]  We've never had 30% off on top of the discounts
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.600]  And free shipping, and these are really good Hillary for present t-shirts
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.600]  These are really powerful books and videos, these are really powerful water filtration systems, the very best out there
[39:52.600 --> 39:56.600]  At the highest quality, lower for the same units than you get at Amazon
[39:56.600 --> 40:00.600]  It's insane, and it helps fund the operation
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.600]  So a lot of stuff is selling out, but a lot of great stuff is still there
[40:04.600 --> 40:06.600]  infowars.com, infowarslife.com
[40:06.600 --> 40:12.600]  I'm calling it the Super Tuesday sale, and it will have to end by tomorrow
[40:12.600 --> 40:17.600]  Because I can't sell out of everything at this discount
[40:17.600 --> 40:20.600]  Because then we'll lose money
[40:20.600 --> 40:25.600]  You can't do a sale that's so good, you sell it everything, when some of it's lost leaders, you gotta keep some goods back
[40:25.600 --> 40:30.600]  So we're gonna have some other big specials later in the week on individual items that we do have a lot of
[40:30.600 --> 40:34.600]  But extended 30% off of in stock products at infowarsstore.com
[40:34.600 --> 40:37.600]  Free shipping on orders above $50
[40:37.600 --> 40:43.600]  Some products have sold out, but we are extending the sale to most of our in stock products
[40:43.600 --> 40:47.600]  You get auto ship though, for guaranteed delivery on stuff that's even out of stock
[40:47.600 --> 40:52.600]  We keep a surplus back of that, and you get 10% off on top of the 30% in free shipping, that is just insane
[40:52.600 --> 40:57.600]  What we've already sold out of is Super Mill Vitality, Secret 12, DNA Force, Living Defense, and a bunch of other items
[40:57.600 --> 41:00.600]  Liver Shield is back in stock, you can get that
[41:00.600 --> 41:03.600]  Oxipowder back in stock, Super Female did sell out
[41:03.600 --> 41:08.600]  Anthroplex, the truck just arrived yesterday, that's basically like Super Mill Vitality, it's excellent
[41:08.600 --> 41:12.600]  But even more affordable, it is discounted right now 30% off
[41:12.600 --> 41:16.600]  So there's also some silver linings there of some items that have come back into stock
[41:16.600 --> 41:22.600]  InfoWars Select, high quality, storeable foods, 30% off, I mean it's just the best deals ever
[41:22.600 --> 41:25.600]  And thank you all for your support, go read the 5 star reviews and more
[41:25.600 --> 41:31.600]  InfoWarsStore.com, or InfoWarsLife.com takes you directly to the Nutraceuticals or call toll free
[41:31.600 --> 41:37.600]  888-253-3139, there's also amazing, we're going to Roger Stone right now
[41:37.600 --> 41:41.600]  Take that call, that's from Trump if you need to sir, go ahead
[41:41.600 --> 41:45.600]  I can see him there on the TV, and his wife handing him the phone
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.600]  Just so much going on, so much happening, now let's go back to that Drudge Report article
[41:50.600 --> 41:54.600]  Top story, Drudge Report, middle column
[41:54.600 --> 42:00.600]  Callers flood, news radio stations, we now learn TV stations, you name it
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.600]  Saying that they try to vote for Trump, it flips to Rubio
[42:04.600 --> 42:08.600]  And it's coming in now from other counties across Texas and other areas like Ohio
[42:08.600 --> 42:13.600]  And he is literally just been working 20 hours a day
[42:13.600 --> 42:17.600]  And I called him this morning, he said absolutely the reports are pouring in here
[42:17.600 --> 42:21.600]  From our political operatives on the ground, I don't know how much I can repeat that he told me
[42:21.600 --> 42:25.600]  Because some of it's major inside baseball, rogerstonestonezone.com bestselling author
[42:25.600 --> 42:29.600]  Trump Insider, thank you for coming on with us sir
[42:29.600 --> 42:35.600]  Just to be very clear, what I'm getting from Ohio are complaints about their absentee ballot process
[42:35.600 --> 42:40.600]  And their early voting process, their contest is not today, it's on March 15th
[42:40.600 --> 42:46.600]  I have authorized a team that is on its way to Ohio, two attorneys, a mathematician
[42:46.600 --> 42:50.600]  And a lawyer, pardon me, two attorneys, a mathematician
[42:50.600 --> 42:55.600]  And someone who is a political activist with experience in this area to try to see what is going on
[42:55.600 --> 42:59.600]  And Paul Watson is writing an article, we need to make sure it's clear, because the media will go with this
[42:59.600 --> 43:03.600]  We know Ohio isn't now, but it's key for Casey to keep him in
[43:03.600 --> 43:09.600]  This is with the absentee and early voting, and Stone is sending a team, is launching an investigation
[43:09.600 --> 43:10.600]  Please continue
[43:10.600 --> 43:16.600]  Which is dominant in Ohio, I must tell you Alex, the one thing the Ohio Republican Party really knows how to do
[43:16.600 --> 43:22.600]  Is run up the score in these absentee ballots, they mail them, they chase them
[43:22.600 --> 43:27.600]  They chase them down with the people, with telephones, they get them to the registrars, they're very good at it
[43:27.600 --> 43:31.600]  They go into the nursing homes, maybe sometimes they mark a ballot or two
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.600]  But they're very, very adept, they're very smooth, they operate like the old Democrats
[43:36.600 --> 43:41.600]  And John Kasich is using the State Republican Party like a super PAC
[43:41.600 --> 43:46.600]  They are doing the mailing and the chasing, looking into the legality of that
[43:46.600 --> 43:51.600]  But what's more disturbing to me is the complaints I'm getting today
[43:51.600 --> 43:56.600]  We've just gotten some complaints from the Boston area, people attempting to vote today
[43:56.600 --> 44:00.600]  Telling us that the lever will not go down over Donald J. Trump's name
[44:00.600 --> 44:06.600]  So we are on top of this, we're going to be establishing an 800 number shortly
[44:06.600 --> 44:11.600]  So that anyone who experiences a difficulty can contact us
[44:11.600 --> 44:17.600]  I have contacted and we are bringing on as a consultant, Richard Charnin
[44:17.600 --> 44:25.600]  Who is a mathematician and probably the world's foremost expert on computerized voter fraud
[44:25.600 --> 44:35.600]  It is not, we saw the massive cheating in Ohio that most likely delivered the state to George Bush over John Kerry
[44:35.600 --> 44:38.600]  There's a lot of evidence the machines were tampered with then
[44:38.600 --> 44:47.600]  Four years later, under Mitt Romney, you may recall, Alex, that Carl Rove was incensed on Fox
[44:47.600 --> 44:53.600]  When he was told that Romney would lose Ohio, he was incensed, he said it had to be wrong
[44:53.600 --> 44:57.600]  That's because Carl thought that he had taken care of that problem
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.600]  Evidently, Barack Obama came in with a higher bid to the local poobahs
[45:02.600 --> 45:07.600]  And the people called the machinery, but those die-bold machinery, those die-bold voting machines
[45:07.600 --> 45:13.600]  You know, the die-bold, all their executives, the family, they're all major donors to the Bush machine
[45:13.600 --> 45:16.600]  So there's plenty of reason for cause here
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.600]  We are not going to let this nomination be stolen from Donald Trump
[45:20.600 --> 45:25.600]  We don't have the politicians, we have more volunteers, we have more first timers, we have more enthusiasm
[45:25.600 --> 45:32.600]  He's setting records in these crowds, but I am trying to pull together a lot of my old colleagues from the Goldwater campaign
[45:32.600 --> 45:40.600]  As far back as Goldwater, from the Reagan campaigns, from conservative campaigns, from Ron Paul's campaign, various campaigns
[45:40.600 --> 45:43.600]  We are going to get together and see if we can dig into these charges
[45:43.600 --> 45:50.600]  Roger Stone, they have had top political science professors and others come out that have never really called an election improperly
[45:50.600 --> 45:55.600]  We can put it up on screen for TV viewers, I'll read the headline for listeners on radio
[45:55.600 --> 46:01.600]  That Trump has a 97 to 99% chance of winning the presidency
[46:01.600 --> 46:05.600]  And again, this is top political scientists that are hired by the major parties
[46:05.600 --> 46:09.600]  This is what the odds makers are saying in London and in Vegas now
[46:09.600 --> 46:18.600]  So if he doesn't win, they're stealing it, I mean in polls, he surged from 40% in most Super Tuesday states to 45%
[46:18.600 --> 46:22.600]  NASCAR has endorsed him, the top drivers have endorsed him
[46:22.600 --> 46:25.600]  Senator Sessions has endorsed him, Chris Christie has endorsed him
[46:25.600 --> 46:28.600]  Obviously he is the nominee as Drudge said a week ago
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.600]  Are they willing to steal this in front of everybody when it's not close?
[46:33.600 --> 46:39.600]  Because all the fraud experts I've talked to over my 20 years on air say they have trouble stealing landslides and tsunamis
[46:39.600 --> 46:42.600]  Is this a tsunami and do they have the will to try to steal it?
[46:42.600 --> 46:47.600]  But remember we have two different things here, you're addressing the question of the popular vote in the primaries
[46:47.600 --> 46:51.600]  Which is going to be overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump
[46:51.600 --> 46:54.600]  But this system operates on the basis of delegates
[46:54.600 --> 47:00.600]  And if Donald Trump gets to Cleveland with short of the magic number to be nominated
[47:00.600 --> 47:07.600]  Then I think there's a high probability that when you go to a second ballot you're up for a real battle
[47:07.600 --> 47:14.600]  Here's why, on the first ballot a number of these delegates are bound by state law by the results of the primary
[47:14.600 --> 47:21.600]  So the Republican bosses fill the delegation with people who are actually anti-Trump or more precisely controlled
[47:21.600 --> 47:28.600]  And they've been bragging that they're controlled and a lot of them have government or corporate jobs that their whole job is based on being that delegate
[47:28.600 --> 47:32.600]  They're hacks, they're organization people, they're insiders, they do what they're told
[47:32.600 --> 47:37.600]  Particularly in New York where followed the boss, this is the home of boss Thomas Platt
[47:37.600 --> 47:39.600]  This is the home of boss Tweed
[47:39.600 --> 47:42.600]  Politics in New York and both parties, everyone follows the boss
[47:42.600 --> 47:47.600]  The boss can switch to another candidate on the second ballot because they're his people
[47:47.600 --> 47:51.600]  In other words after the first ballot everyone is unbound by state law
[47:51.600 --> 47:56.600]  And no longer required to vote on the basis of the percentages of the primaries
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.600]  So there is room for mischief
[48:00.600 --> 48:04.600]  There's also room for mischief in the convention rules
[48:04.600 --> 48:15.600]  Where you could for example put a requirement that the nominee have a majority of the delegates in 15 states
[48:15.600 --> 48:23.600]  Otherwise all names, even those including people who had never won any delegates in any primary could be put into play
[48:23.600 --> 48:29.600]  So they're going to monkey with this to try to come up with various anti-Trump angles
[48:29.600 --> 48:32.600]  And to try to hang us up
[48:32.600 --> 48:35.600]  This by the way is something the Bushies really excel at
[48:35.600 --> 48:38.600]  In politics there's one of Stone's rules
[48:38.600 --> 48:41.600]  He who knows the rules rules
[48:41.600 --> 48:43.600]  And we've got a hell of a fight on our hands
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.600]  This is why we have set up StopTheSteel.org
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.600]  This project to start looking into voter fraud and also begin preparing for the convention
[48:52.600 --> 48:56.600]  And just with the money you've raised so far you're already deploying a team to Ohio
[48:56.600 --> 48:58.600]  Try to head them off at the pass
[48:58.600 --> 49:01.600]  I want to come back and talk about the Koch brothers
[49:01.600 --> 49:04.600]  They came out in the New York Times in Buzzfeed, Politico, you name it saying
[49:04.600 --> 49:07.600]  Roger Stone, Alex Jones are wrong, Drudge is wrong
[49:07.600 --> 49:11.600]  We aren't funding anybody in the campaign
[49:11.600 --> 49:13.600]  We're not involved in the primary
[49:13.600 --> 49:15.600]  They're on record giving millions in the primary
[49:15.600 --> 49:20.600]  But then their top political strategist goes over to just quote run the Rubio campaign
[49:20.600 --> 49:22.600]  That's in the news the same day
[49:22.600 --> 49:25.600]  How obvious is it that they're lying?
[49:25.600 --> 49:28.600]  Yeah, I know that was agreed to at the meeting last week in New York
[49:28.600 --> 49:31.600]  Now there is some conflation here to be very clear
[49:31.600 --> 49:35.600]  A meeting was held in New York in which the Koch brothers
[49:35.600 --> 49:39.600]  So I always imagine looking at Ralph Bellamy and Don Amici
[49:39.600 --> 49:41.600]  I don't know why
[49:41.600 --> 49:46.600]  But the Koch brothers give Marco Rubio $25 million
[49:46.600 --> 49:50.600]  With the admonition you can have our political guy
[49:50.600 --> 49:55.600]  But you have to show legs before Florida on March 15
[49:55.600 --> 49:58.600]  If he loses on March 15
[49:58.600 --> 50:01.600]  Kasek wins Ohio on March 15
[50:01.600 --> 50:03.600]  Which he is still favored to do
[50:03.600 --> 50:07.600]  Although I think Rubio is in trouble, big trouble in Texas
[50:07.600 --> 50:09.600]  In Florida
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.600]  Then he gets the hook and Mitt Romney is all suited up in the wings
[50:13.600 --> 50:16.600]  Alex, I asked you why suddenly he's Mitt Romney
[50:16.600 --> 50:19.600]  After months and months and months of no political commentary
[50:19.600 --> 50:23.600]  He's now starting to launch these zingers at Donald Trump
[50:23.600 --> 50:25.600]  Well sure, you live in New York and also in Florida
[50:25.600 --> 50:27.600]  You're the consulate insider
[50:27.600 --> 50:30.600]  I was there, you were on the phone with these people that were at the meeting
[50:30.600 --> 50:31.600]  I was there with you Friday
[50:31.600 --> 50:33.600]  It happened Thursday, you got the intel
[50:33.600 --> 50:35.600]  This is what was openly discussed
[50:35.600 --> 50:36.600]  And then they just sit there
[50:36.600 --> 50:40.600]  I have spent 40 years in the corroded rectum of the Republican party
[50:40.600 --> 50:44.600]  I have been there for the recounts and the battles
[50:44.600 --> 50:48.600]  I will have been to every Republican National Convention since 1964
[50:48.600 --> 50:50.600]  Stay there, see where they were buried, Goldwater
[50:50.600 --> 50:51.600]  Stay there
[50:51.600 --> 50:53.600]  We're going to go back into the stone zone straight ahead
[50:53.600 --> 50:56.600]  As it appears they're trying to seal enough delegates
[50:56.600 --> 50:58.600]  Remember, these aren't winter take-all
[50:58.600 --> 51:00.600]  They're trying to cheat Trump and have a broker convention
[51:00.600 --> 51:02.600]  I'm tired of the coldest winter
[51:02.600 --> 51:05.600]  Are you prepared for the next blizzard or snowstorm?
[51:05.600 --> 51:07.600]  What will you do when the power and heat go off?

[52:30.600 --> 52:33.600]  And phytonutrients so the body will heal itself
[52:33.600 --> 52:36.600]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure
[52:36.600 --> 52:39.600]  Down with cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries
[52:39.600 --> 52:43.600]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic stuff

[52:59.600 --> 53:02.600]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough
[53:02.600 --> 53:04.600]  And now they're adding ammonia?
[53:04.600 --> 53:09.600]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply
[53:09.600 --> 53:11.600]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine
[53:11.600 --> 53:16.600]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water

[54:20.600 --> 54:23.600]  I'm gonna be here tonight as well, this is just too important
[54:23.600 --> 54:26.600]  I'm gonna go home and spend some time with the children after school
[54:26.600 --> 54:28.600]  And do some activities
[54:28.600 --> 54:32.600]  And then I'm going to come back up here tonight and cover it right through Super Tuesday
[54:32.600 --> 54:34.600]  This is just too important
[54:34.600 --> 54:41.600]  But I'll be here for relief for the folks up here and then to give them a break during the coverage
[54:41.600 --> 54:49.600]  But that'll be coming up tonight, infowars.com, forward slash show for all the free feeds, stations, TV stations and radio stations
[54:49.600 --> 54:54.600]  All over are requesting every week new ones taking care of your show as their contract
[54:54.600 --> 55:00.600]  And I go, it's free to air, run any ads you want over the ad spaces, preempt us, do whatever you want
[55:00.600 --> 55:06.600]  That's why I do the TV nightly news, the radio's great, we get half the ads, you get half the ads, that's the network deal
[55:06.600 --> 55:11.600]  With my TV show, free to air, free to air, a public service
[55:11.600 --> 55:18.600]  And it's always an hour, weeknights, seven to eight, but during special events, elections, terror attacks
[55:18.600 --> 55:23.600]  Earthquakes, whatever, we go live for hour after hour after hour with our amazing crew
[55:23.600 --> 55:26.600]  And that's where your support of this broadcast comes in
[55:26.600 --> 55:32.600]  When you buy the great nutraceuticals, the non-GMO seeds, the Patriot T-shirts, the books, the films, Roger Stone's books
[55:32.600 --> 55:39.600]  The profit we make from that, which is good because we sell stuff for such low prices at such high quality
[55:39.600 --> 55:42.600]  We sell more of it, that's free market and we're able to fund this operation
[55:42.600 --> 55:49.600]  So morally, without a bunch of weird sponsors, without a bunch of weird corporations and big, you know, establishment money
[55:49.600 --> 55:53.600]  This is you funding media that protects and defends the Republic
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.600]  So we've got the extended leap year sale is limited, the sale's gone
[55:57.600 --> 56:03.600]  But what's left, the products that haven't sold out, and there's a lot of them, only sold out of a fraction of the products
[56:03.600 --> 56:07.600]  We're calling it the Super Tuesday sale, but it's got to end tomorrow because I can't sell out of everything
[56:07.600 --> 56:13.600]  In forwardstore.com, Roger Stone getting back to this, people got to put their time, their energy and their money behind this
[56:13.600 --> 56:19.600]  If people want to see election fraud exposed, they've got to go to stopthesteel.org, they've got to support it
[56:19.600 --> 56:23.600]  They've got to call you and offer to be volunteers, they've got to report what they see happening
[56:23.600 --> 56:26.600]  This is a fight, this is the animating contest of Liberty
[56:26.600 --> 56:31.600]  Other points you'd like to make about what's currently happening today, what you expect to see happen
[56:31.600 --> 56:36.600]  Because obviously, there's a tsunami here, but you're saying they're going to try to steal it at the convention
[56:36.600 --> 56:41.600]  Well, look, I think that they're situational at this point
[56:41.600 --> 56:47.600]  I do think we have to live a little in the sense because you're asking me what kind of hand Trump will have until the cards have been dealt
[56:47.600 --> 56:50.600]  Let's look Wednesday morning, I'm very, very confident
[56:50.600 --> 56:54.600]  He has been drawing some of the largest crowds of the campaign
[56:54.600 --> 57:04.600]  But he is taking it, I don't have to tell you, from the Pope, from the Mexican president, from all these institutions
[57:04.600 --> 57:15.600]  He's got Marco Rubio in a purile, childish rant about the fact that he can't seem to, no matter what he does, he will never have the gravitas
[57:15.600 --> 57:20.600]  Or the stature, or the record, or the capability to be president
[57:20.600 --> 57:22.600]  He looks like a boy standing next to a man
[57:22.600 --> 57:27.600]  Well, you know what's funny? His voice went out and it sounded like a squeaky, mickey mouse and he has the ears
[57:27.600 --> 57:33.600]  And I'm not trying to be mean, it's just he shouldn't be making comments about physical appearance when he looks like a space alien
[57:33.600 --> 57:37.600]  Yeah, no, look, it's become a real, it's degenerated into a slugfest
[57:37.600 --> 57:44.600]  The thing people need to remember, Alex, is Marco is just an attractive new vessel for the same old crap
[57:44.600 --> 57:47.600]  This is the Bush New World Order agenda
[57:47.600 --> 57:50.600]  Same crap, different bag
[57:50.600 --> 57:54.600]  Right, it's Neoconism on steroids
[57:54.600 --> 57:59.600]  This guy wants to march off to war every place, he will open our borders, no matter what he says today
[57:59.600 --> 58:03.600]  He goes, he's been caught once trying to get our borders opened
[58:03.600 --> 58:07.600]  As one of the notorious gang of eight, which is mutiny, that's treason
[58:07.600 --> 58:10.600]  And then he lies about it when he's on record doing it
[58:10.600 --> 58:15.600]  Which doesn't make him different than Ted Cruz, who also lies about it when he's on record
[58:15.600 --> 58:21.600]  Because no matter what he will say, and he's got that dexodian ability to lie with a straight face
[58:21.600 --> 58:22.600]  Well, that's it, that's it
[58:22.600 --> 58:23.600]  He also voted for it
[58:23.600 --> 58:25.600]  That's it, because that's so key
[58:25.600 --> 58:30.600]  Cruz was bad before he got elected, he's been good since he was, but he was one of the engineers of Amnesty for the Bushes
[58:30.600 --> 58:32.600]  He's such an insider, it's really creepy
[58:32.600 --> 58:36.600]  Do five more minutes with us, and I gotta go, Mr. Stone, we're back in 70 seconds
[58:36.600 --> 58:39.600]  I'm Alex Jones, tell your friends and family and tune in right now
[58:39.600 --> 58:50.600]  History's being made, the new media, the re-assurgence of liberty, versus the Pope, the Communist Chinese, Obama, the Neocons, and every other turd in the basket
[58:50.600 --> 58:53.600]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in
[58:53.600 --> 59:01.600]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time
[59:01.600 --> 59:07.600]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies
[59:07.600 --> 59:09.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[59:52.600 --> 59:56.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:09.600]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.600]  I'm going to take on China and I'm going to take on Mexico
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:25.600]  And there you're going to bring back those jobs, but he doesn't tell you that all that clothes that says Donald J. Trump on it
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.600]  It's not just tacky, it's made in China and in Mexico
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:41.600]  If Donald Trump wants to bring jobs back to America from China and Mexico, he can start today
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:47.600]  Why don't you announce that from now on, no products will be sold that say Donald J. Trump on them unless they're made in America
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:56.600]  All right folks, so there he is going into Mickey Mouse
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.600]  By the way, total transparency here, we're thinking about mountain cameras with live feeds all the time behind the scenes
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.600]  Because we have nothing to hide here, nobody else has ever done this, real reality, radio, TV
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:12.600]  Mark Caesar, the news director, is ready at 590 to give us access to all the tapes and to interview his hosts that were on air and got all the calls
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:18.600]  And to tell you about their newsroom getting flooded, so if you can talk to the two hosts that were there in the morning
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:26.600]  Hosting the show with the dozens of calls, then we can play a few clips and then you can talk to people in their newsroom that got flooded as well
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.600]  So if you like talk to them two minutes, then show the newsroom two minutes and just tell folks what happened
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:36.600]  Put a quick package together as fast as you can, I know we're stressed here and got most of our teams already in the field
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:48.600]  Okay, Cyn Biggs and Josh, they don't even need to be on the shot, just if they want to get the news station on record that they've seen the fraud happening or the reports pouring in to add to the drudge story
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.600]  Great job, thank you
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.600]  You also have, we've got the MP3's from them
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.600]  Okay, great, we'll do it, great job, thank you
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:58.600]  Sorry to cut it to your time, Roger, I know you're busy, I'm just having to war game this in a lifetime
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:06.600]  We're seeing evidence of massive fraud in Austin going for Rubio and that's the establishment candidate, who would be pulling the strings?
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.600]  This is Rome of the Democrats here in Austin
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:16.600]  This isn't, but everybody knows that the Harris County Bushes are in touch and in close allies to the Harris County Democrats
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:22.600]  Is this really surprise you? We're talking about the bellies, Travis County, pardon me, I misspoke
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.600]  Hey, how could you know all the thousands of counties in the country, you're right, but absolutely
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600]  This is the most liberal county in Texas, I believe
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.600]  Yes
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.600]  And therefore it's not surprising that they're in bed together, never lose sight of the fact that the Bushes and the Clintons are joined at the hip
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:44.600]  And earlier in the race, remember Hillary Clinton kept attacking Jeb while Jeb was foundering, that was an attempt to elevate Jeb among the Republicans
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:54.600]  So as I outlined in my book, Jeb and the Bush Crime Family, and in my book, The Clintons' War on Women, these two families apologize for each other, rehabilitate each other
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.600]  And they profiteer, they steal together
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.600]  Alex, one other point I would make that I think is absolutely key
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:16.600]  And that is that these, we have all these late primaries where you've got some big winner take all states, you can see why Romney is maneuvering for that
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:30.600]  So even though I think Trump is going to do great today, and even though I've never seen a political uprising like this, an insurgency if you will, but the fear in the eyes of the establishment is like nothing I've ever seen
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.600]  Because some people are going to get prosecuted and go to jail
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:42.600]  So will they double down and pull out all the stops and get caught even worse, or will they snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, will they steal it all yet again?
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.600]  And that's how we see these ridiculous attacks on Trump University
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:53.600]  Look, 98% of the people who went to Trump University, which was a real estate course, were satisfied, and they went on to make money, presumably
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:59.600]  It's one of the top real estate guys in history, I mean, if you don't get something out of a course, that's your problem, Dumbo
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:09.600]  Exactly, and this went to court, even though there are multiple suits, the Attorney Generals fought consolidations into all one suit
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:22.600]  So it's already going to trial in New York, the New York Democrat Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, tried to hold Donald and his daughter Ivanka, who's an amazing person, up for campaign contributions
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.600]  So when they refused to come up and spit out big dollars, he brought an action
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.600]  Well, if he wasn't my daughter, I did her too
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:34.600]  He got ignominiously defeated in court, he lost on every count
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.600]  Roger, I know you've got to go, you're busier than a one-legged man and you know what
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:45.600]  But your call, I know there's a lot of, I've been steering the show here, is there any other key points you want to impart to people?
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:56.600]  You know, we're going to start, we're going to begin sending people out to these various states that are voting today for the poll closings to check where there is a paper trail
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.600]  Roger Stone, we'll talk to you again very soon, thank you for your tireless work
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:09.600]  The British government is pushing the Investigory Powers Bill or Snoopers Charter that will effectively end internet privacy
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:16.600]  The proposed legislation targets popular chat and message services such as WhatsApp, iMessage and FaceTime
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:24.600]  Outlaws end to end encryption and will force Apple to rewrite its iOS from the ground up to accommodate surveillance by the state
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.600]  It would also force tech companies to provide back doors accessible to government
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:34.600]  Additionally, the law requires ISPs to keep records of all internet activity of its customers
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.600]  The data would be available to the government for a year
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:46.600]  In 2015, the British Home Secretary Theresa May admitted that a 1983 Telecom Act permitted bulk retention of data by MI5
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.600]  And the agency has done so since September 2001

[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.600]  I salute you for your tireless fight against tyranny and your support of the Infowar
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:09.600]  Without you, none of this is possible
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.600]  We're now into the second hour of our four hours here from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.600]  Of coverage of Super Tuesday and other geopolitical events and economic events that are taking place
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:26.600]  We have investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, who works for Infowars.com, who put out the investigations that have now gone national
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:32.600]  And the inquire in other places about connections to Marco Rubio and the gay mafia in Florida
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.600]  We're going to be talking to him at the bottom of the hour
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:46.600]  But right now, just for the next 15 minutes, Phyllis Schlafly, who is literally one of the longest serving, hardest fighting paleo-conservative
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:52.600]  Constitutionalist out there, constitutional lawyer, truly someone that's helped lead and empower women
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.600]  And men as well, the founder of Eagle Forum
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.600]  And she wrote the best-selling book, A Choice on an Echo, that's back in print now
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.600]  And she's worked in major administrations, Ronald Reagan, you name it
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:12.600]  I am not going to go over her whole bio, but it's basically like interviewing Barry Goldwater or Ronald Reagan here on the show
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:18.600]  In her tireless fight, talking about breaking through glass ceilings, she was doing that before they called it that
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:25.600]  And she, of course, is testified for Congress, you name it, she's been named one of the most 100 important women of the 20th century
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.600]  By the Ladies' Home Journal, EagleForum.org, Phyllis Schlafly
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.600]  Phyllis, thank you for coming on, what a circus
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:42.600]  But Super Tuesday, the Pope and the Chinese government, Communist, and the former Mexican president and the Democrats and the Republicans and the Koch brothers
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:46.600]  And the whole Republican establishment coming out against Trump
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.600]  I mean, why are they so scared of him? I know you've tacitly endorsed him
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.600]  NASCAR has come out, Chris Christie, Senator Sessions, so many others
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.600]  It seems like the camps are forming
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.600]  Phyllis Schlafly, thank you so much for coming on with us
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.600]  Well, thanks so much, Alex, it's always good to join you
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.600]  You're the expert on this, what is front and center for you watching this campaign and what's on the table?
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:18.600]  Well, it's the most fun I've had with TV in years, watching the absolute dismay of the establishment who cannot get rid of Trump
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:25.600]  They've tried everything they possibly can and they simply can't do it
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.600]  Does he smell like Reagan to you?
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.600]  Oh, yes, he does
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:47.600]  The thing is, he's just a guy who is not intimidated by the establishment
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:59.600]  And we like that and I like him especially because he made immigration the top issue
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.600]  And nobody else wanted to talk about it except Ann Coulter
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:08.600]  Donald Trump is a true game changer, so let's walk through as a political expert and a societal expert
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:14.600]  What is front and center for you, Phyllis? Give us your marching orders, break down what the stakes are for us
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:24.600]  Well, I'm with Jeff Sessions and you know what he said the other day was that the candidate has got to be right on immigration
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:32.600]  And he's got to be right on these phony trade deals and if you're not right on that, he's not going to vote for you
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.600]  And I agree with Jeff Sessions
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.600]  That's the sovereignty of our country in the balance
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:46.600]  That's right, and I remember the last one of these trade deals they put through, they promised it was going to make 30,000 jobs
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:51.600]  Well, it did, but they were all in South Korea
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.600]  It's simply incredible that we've gotten to this point
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:02.600]  What do you think of the world leaders piling on and lecturing Americans about what we should do internally?
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.600]  That's always been a no-no
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:11.600]  Well, they think they are really the king makers, you know, that's what I named them during the very Goldwater days
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:19.600]  And they really enjoy that role and think they should tell the rest of us dumb people what to do
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:26.600]  But I don't think that's the way it ought to be, our Constitution says we're governed by we the people
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:36.600]  And I encourage everybody to get busy and vote for your conscience and not be intimidated by what the grassroots are trying to dictate to you
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:45.600]  You knew Barry Goldwater well, and I've studied in what an amazing patriot who exposed the whole globalist agenda decades before it was even known
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:55.600]  How different would this country be today if we would have elected Barry Goldwater, A, I know he influenced Reagan greatly, but B, what would Barry Goldwater say today if he saw where this country was?
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.600]  Well, he would be disappointed at the people we've put up to run for office
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:15.600]  You know, Reagan wasn't perfect in every way, but he did believe in America and he did obey the Constitution
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:23.600]  And something that is definitely the right way to behave
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.600]  He was a nationalist and anti-communist
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:40.600]  He was and he meant what he said and you know, I asked Walker who was running for president earlier and dropped out
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:50.600]  What was the most important decision Reagan made and he said the decision to fire the air traffic controllers
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:59.600]  And they all snickered and laughed, they thought that was a dumb answer and then they went over and asked the authority on economics
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.600]  Is his name Schmidt or?
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.600]  Yes
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.600]  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.600]  Yes ma'am
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:16.600]  And he gave the same answer and the thing was that that's when the Russians understood what kind of a man they were dealing with
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:22.600]  And they couldn't push him around and he was going to mean what he said and say what he means
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:29.600]  And so that's what we like about him and that's what we like about Trump
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:35.600]  Well the arrogance of all these other countries saying we've got to have open borders and we've got to give everybody free stuff
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.600]  None of them do that
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.600]  Oh no, of course they didn't
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:42.600]  And you know the good example of what's happening is Germany
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.600]  Now I thought Germany, the Germans are pretty tough people
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:56.600]  But they let all these immigrants into their country and they regret it now and they're trying to get rid of them
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.600]  We've only got five minutes left with you, we really appreciate your time
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.600]  You have the floor to talk about the state of the world, Donald Trump
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.600]  Well I think immigration is the number one issue and these trade deals also
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:15.600]  And these trade deals are all bad and it's such a mistake that they call it free trade
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.600]  It's free for the other countries but not for us
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:27.600]  And they have really destroyed our jobs and our opportunities for the middle class
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.600]  It's just terrible what they've done to our country
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.600]  We had a great country built on the middle class
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:41.600]  And the trade deals have really destroyed that
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.600]  Well the elites think driving down the wedge and turning us into a third world country will give them control
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.600]  Instead they're soiling their own nests, killing the golden goose
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.600]  What does your gut tell you about Trump?
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.600]  Will they be able to manufacture more attacks or steal the election or does your gut tell you?
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.600]  The polls show you'll destroy
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.600]  They're going to do everything they possibly can
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.600]  They're going to pull every dirty trick they can possibly do
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.600]  And I hope they're not going to be successful
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.600]  But you've got to give them me forever for trying for the last ten years
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.600]  What does your gut tell you? Do you think he's going to actually get the nomination?
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.600]  I do think he's going to get the nomination
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.600]  Because I think so many people are fed up with the king makers
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.600]  And the polls show he will destroy Hillary
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.600]  The polls show he will destroy Hillary
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:41.600]  Yeah, and so the polls are showing that Trump is leading
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.600]  And I think that's true, I think people really want him
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.600]  Howard Stern came out and said
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.600]  They want somebody who's going to stand up for America
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.600]  They like his slogan, we're going to make America greater, Grant
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.600]  He's even got liberals like Howard Stern endorsing him
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.600]  People are sick of America being put down
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.600]  They're sick of America being put tenth
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.600]  They're sick of all of it
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.600]  And they love somebody that's plain-spoken
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.600]  Who doesn't apologize and doesn't back down
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.600]  Even if they disagree with some of what he says
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.600]  And the fact that we're faced with Hillary
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.600]  Looking at the Bushes and closing
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.600]  You were there when they tried to broker that convention in 1980
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.600]  And made Reagan take George Herbert Walker Bush
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.600]  Are you concerned about a broker convention this time?
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.600]  Because the Koch brothers and others say they're lining up to do that
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.600]  Well, I don't think they'll convince Trump to go along with him
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.600]  I think he'll stand firm
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:35.600]  That's his reputation and I think it's true
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.600]  That he won't give in as...
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.600]  But you know, they worked on Reagan all night
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.600]  And he thought that he couldn't get through the night
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.600]  With the pressure that was being put on him
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.600]  And so that's, you remember
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.600]  He called George W. Bush at 11.30 p.m.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.600]  And said, get on over here
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.600]  I'm introducing you as vice president
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.600]  And...
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.600]  Well, history was made
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.600]  Because they felt they could...
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.600]  They really wanted the other guy
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.600]  But at any rate, they couldn't get him in
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:22.600]  And that's how we got the Bush as a successor
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.600]  Amazing
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.600]  Well, I believe we can defeat globalism, restore nationalism
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.600]  And break this trance
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.600]  And say we're allowed to have a country
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.600]  We're allowed to have sovereignty
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.600]  We're allowed to be proud of ourselves
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.600]  We're allowed to do this
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600]  We don't have to go under globalism
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.600]  We don't have to sign our rights over the TPP or NAU
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.600]  And I think that Trump is helping break the hoax
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.600]  Of course, standing on the shoulders of people like you and Ron Paul
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.600]  And Barry Goldwater
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.600]  And Ronald Reagan and countless others that came before them
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.600]  It's got to be satisfying, fellas, in closing, though
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.600]  To see such a strong, true, conservative movement
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.600]  That you and Barry Goldwater and others helped found
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.600]  And I don't want to just give credit here
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.600]  But history's important
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.600]  Who else would you like to credit as being the founders
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.600]  Of what we see today as a real shot of saving America?
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.600]  Well, it was really...
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.600]  It was really Reagan who did it
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.600]  He was the flag carrier for the whole conservative movement
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.600]  And Barry Goldwater did a great job
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:28.600]  But then he kind of wandered off the reservation after that
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.600]  But at any rate, the movement that was created by Barry Goldwater
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.600]  Has retained and we've built it
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.600]  And Eagle Farm has played a big role in that
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.600]  And I encourage people to be active in politics
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.600]  So that's where the action is
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.600]  Absolutely, and if you think there's a lesson for us, fine
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.600]  And I want them all to go to Cleveland
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.600]  Absolutely, get involved, take over the system
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.600]  Phyllis Schlappley, EagleForm.org
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.600]  Thank you so much for joining us on Super Tuesday
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.600]  Thank you, Alex
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.600]  We'll be back with breaking news information on that one show
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.600]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.600]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.600]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.600]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.600]  His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.600]  He wasn't a rich man by any means
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.600]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.600]  Would have been the perfect alternative for my father

[01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.600]  Goberkey.com
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:04.600]  Biochemistry determines your mood, memory, energy, and endurance
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.600]  Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.600]  One World Way is a unique, non-denatured protein
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.600]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:18.600]  Whereas typical whey protein powders offer no more than 18% utilization of protein
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.600]  One World Way also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:27.600]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.600]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing for me
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:38.600]  I'm 36 years old and for the past several years I've been struggling with lack of energy, dryness, and stamina
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:42.600]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.600]  My yoga practice has depended and as a massage therapist
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:48.600]  I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.600]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.600]  Call 888-988-3325
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:57.600]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.600]  That's One World, W-H-E-Y.com
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.600]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.600]  And has sold out in many areas of the country
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.600]  It caught me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.600]  Now revealing FEMA's plaque at Lami and Hot Water
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.600]  But I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:21.600]  I just created a free video presentation at 123fema.com
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:25.600]  That exposes the truth. Be warned, it's really disturbing
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:29.600]  Because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.600]  Go to 123fema.com to see the number one item to hoard
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.600]  And why supplies of this critical item are so low
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:40.600]  Or even completely sold out already at many stores across America
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:45.600]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in recent days
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:51.600]  Go to 123fema.com and discover the number one item most critical in a crisis
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:56.600]  Go watch my video now at 123fema.com before they force me to shut it down
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:19.600]  Again, that's 123fema.com
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.600]  And we also tonight probably should give out our own studio number
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.600]  And take calls specifically on exit polling
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.600]  What people experienced, what happened
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.600]  That's an idea I have a meaning to add
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.600]  I don't know if we can get that done in this short time
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.600]  But we'll see
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.600]  That way it's not just our great crew
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.600]  I'm going to sit there for five hours and talk
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.600]  Playing clips, I mean it's informative
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.600]  And we analyze the mainstream media as it unfolds
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.600]  But it's even more grueling than just covering a debate
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.600]  Because you can sit back and let them talk and then cover the debate
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:58.600]  But actually sit up for four or five hours is very very tiring at times
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.600]  So I'm going to be up here helping as well
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.600]  And going over all the latest information
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.600]  We do have a guest, another guest
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.600]  Popping in Wayne Madsen on the whole gay mafia angle
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.600]  With Marco Rubio
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:16.600]  And every time I mention something like this
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:20.600]  I see news articles going Alex Jones is bashing gay people
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.600]  Well, I'm not against people they call gay
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.600]  I am against you taking over the language
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.600]  It's called homosexual, it's called heterosexual
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.600]  Between a man and a woman
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.600]  And two women, you know, it's lesbians from the Isle of Lesbos
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.600]  There's no connotation there, it's just the island of women
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:41.600]  As you can see, Islas Maheras in Spanish
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.600]  Isla Maheras, if you want to talk about Mexico
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:49.600]  And I'm not on your back, I don't care, whatever
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.600]  Just don't, whether you're heterosexual or homosexual
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.600]  Try to control language and tell me how to talk
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.600]  And don't try to go into the schools and recruit the kids
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.600]  And try to act like their parents
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:04.600]  And go beyond, I mean as a parent I don't talk about sex to my kids
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.600]  To like 12 or 13
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.600]  Only talk about it with my son so far
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.600]  I have younger daughters, it's like the school does it though
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:19.600]  And then you get into all this stuff that isn't even the basics
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.600]  It's not your business and it's sick
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.600]  And then I look at Marco Rubio
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:28.600]  Who gets arrested at this bathroom in the middle of the night
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.600]  They hide the records, the guy gets arrested with
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.600]  He gets caught running a gay porn site
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.600]  And a gay porn production company
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.600]  And a house
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.600]  And he's got this family member he's close to
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.600]  With the drug dealing and all this stuff
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.600]  Saying whoa, that's black, maleable material
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.600]  Quite frankly
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.600]  This is how they control Congress
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.600]  Whether it's homosexual or heterosexual
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.600]  They control people through the sexual stuff
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.600]  And that's why I wish these politicians
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:09.600]  Would break the back of the political system that uses this
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.600]  And come out and not get into lurid details
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.600]  But say I partied a lot when I was in college
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.600]  Had a lot of wild stuff, I'm a loving family man
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.600]  With a wife and kids now
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.600]  And so I'm not going to talk about people's personal lives
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.600]  And what they're into, but here's the deal
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.600]  Marco Rubio and others have done that themselves
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.600]  So they've opened the door up
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.600]  So let's be clear
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.600]  I'm not here judging this guy
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.600]  Because Lord knows none of us are perfect
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.600]  And I don't have these type of escapades
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.600]  That looks like he's involved in, but let me tell you
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.600]  I'm certainly not going to sit up here and tell you
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.600]  That I'm not pep in the pew
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.600]  In some points of my life when it comes to women
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.600]  And so I'm just not on a high horse
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.600]  Here's the deal though, I don't screw anybody over
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.600]  I don't cheat anybody
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.600]  I don't hurt innocent people
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.600]  And I treat people like I want to be treated
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.600]  And I am a good family man today
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.600]  But this idea that stuff you've done in your past
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.600]  Then enslaves you and controls you is wrong
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.600]  And once it's murdering people or ripping people off
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.600]  If you're, if it's victimless
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.600]  Then I don't say it's a crime
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:14.600]  It may be a crime in God's eyes
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.600]  But I'm not here to judge stuff that
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.600]  I see you beat an old lady's brains out with a baseball bat
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.600]  I know you're a murderer and I'm going to try to stop you
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.600]  But when it comes to all this nebulous stuff
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.600]  I'm going to get the beam out of my eye
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.600]  Before I try to get the beam out of your eye to quote Christ
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.600]  He says, oh, I got a speck of mine, I got a beam in yours
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.600]  But that said, that's how they control people
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:39.600]  In these secret societies, these sex societies
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.600]  It's one of the biggest, that's how they've done it for thousands of years
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.600]  And so these things are used as tools
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.600]  And so Marco Rubio is fair game
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.600]  And I tell you, the evidence is pretty strong
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.600]  The smell is strong
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.600]  Kind of like, you don't know what your neighbor's grilling
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:56.600]  But it smells like hamburgers
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.600]  And you go over there, sure enough, it's hamburgers
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.600]  There's some meat smoke blowing over here
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.600]  Or let's use a gross analogy
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.600]  You smell the dead possum
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.600]  You know, there's something dead in the air conditioning vents
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.600]  You don't know what, but it stinks, you know
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.600]  Something's going on here
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.600]  Something is unfolding here
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.600]  And Obama had the same background clearly
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.600]  With the whole bisexual stuff going on
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.600]  And that's how they controlled him
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.600]  And so for me, that's the issue
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.600]  With Hillary
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.600]  How blackmailable is that, that she's seen more
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.600]  Tail than a bicycle seat or a toilet seat
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.600]  Quote Bill Clinton, and that's a quote
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.600]  He said both those
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.600]  I mean, imagine, they've got her and all her girlfriends
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:45.600]  And she's so arrogant, she stays in the same room with them on the campaign trail
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.600]  Reportally, sometimes a couple of women
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:59.600]  I mean, she's partying hard, folks
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.600]  37-page report on sexual abuse in the local diocese
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.600]  Was based partly on evidence from a secret archive
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.600]  Uncovered through a search warrant executed in August
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:30.600]  Said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, who announced the findings
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.600]  These predators desecrated a sacred trust
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:37.600]  And preyed upon their victims in the very places where they should have felt most safe
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.600]  Kane said in a statement, just as troubling
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.600]  It's the cover-up perpetrated by clergy leaders
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.600]  That allow this abuse to continue for decades
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.600]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:50.600]  Because some abusers have died
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.600]  The statute of limitations has expired
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.600]  And in some cases, the victims are too traumatized to testify, she said
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.600]  You can find more reports on Infowars.com

[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.600]  And your support of the Infowar
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.600]  Without you, none of this is possible
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.600]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:01.600]  Good, brother
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.600]  I just recently started using your products
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.600]  Everything you said about them is correct
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.600]  My wife both used a lot of them
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.600]  And it's made a lot of changes in her life here
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.600]  Well, thank you, brother
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.600]  It's because it also funds her operation
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.600]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.600]  Super-male vitality was developed
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.600]  To activate your body's own natural processes
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.600]  Instead of using synthetic chemicals
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.600]  We did the super-male and the super-female vitality
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.600]  Big changes, a lot of energy
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:30.600]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.600]  They've got a ton of money there
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.600]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.600]  Harvested around the planet
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.600]  And then concentrated or maximum potency
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.600]  They want to stun and dumb down
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.600]  And energy drinks and stuff
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:43.600]  Just cover that up for a while
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.600]  But then burn you out in my experience
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.600]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.600]  Goes right to the source
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.600]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it

[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.600]  Something you'll never forget
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:14.600]  From the front lines of the Information War
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.600]  It's Alex Jones
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:25.600]  Turn me on, I'm high tonight
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:30.600]  Something you'll never forget
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:37.600]  Turn me on, I'm high tonight
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.600]  A little bit better than I used to be
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:40.600]  Because I'm alive
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:43.600]  I'm alive wire, baby
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.600]  I love it
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.600]  I'm only alive once going toe-to-toe with the globalists
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.600]  Standing up for the little guys
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.600]  Because I can't stand bullies in trash
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.600]  I don't like violence, but I tell you
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.600]  It's a good feeling when you knock a bully upside the head
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.600]  And their job breaks
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.600]  And you see them fall like sack of potatoes in their head
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.600]  It's that country
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.600]  Because they know they've been run over
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.600]  They always think they're invincible
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.600]  When they start to fight
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.600]  Until they start losing
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:17.600]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.600]  Weeknights, we're back 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.600]  But tonight, extended coverage, infowars.com
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.600]  Forward slash show, we're going to have Wayne Madsen
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:25.600]  Popping in with this analysis
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:26.600]  We're going to have Richard Reeves
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:27.600]  Covered Super Tuesday from the ground
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:30.600]  I'll be there, Jacari Jackson, Leigh Ann McAdoo
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.600]  David Knight, Joe Biggs, Rob Dew
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.600]  Darren McBreen, Kit Daniels
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:38.600]  And anybody else in this great office, my writers
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.600]  My crew, they've all got great points to make
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.600]  So much coming up tonight
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.600]  Infowars.com forward slash show
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.600]  To find all the coverage
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.600]  And you can share the links with everybody
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.600]  We've also got backups on YouTube
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.600]  We're going to have Facebook mentions
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.600]  And so much more
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:54.600]  I had an idea yesterday
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.600]  And I was going to do it again on this show
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.600]  But it's too serious
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.600]  I don't know, I might do it
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.600]  At like 1.30
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.600]  And just let you know it's a joke
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.600]  Because it freaked out people too much
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.600]  Even though I started laughing at the first
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.600]  And said this is not sincere
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600]  Because I couldn't
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.600]  Rob Dew was in the background with Cameron
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.600]  He goes, be strong Alex, you can do it
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:18.600]  Be brave
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.600]  So I started laughing
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:20.600]  McAdoo's off camera
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.600]  She starts laughing
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.600]  We're going to repost at the front page
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.600]  Of Infowars.com
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.600]  And send it out on Twitter at realalexjones
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.600]  So be sure and follow us at realalexjones
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.600]  You got to scroll down on Facebook
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.600]  But it's got the headline
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.600]  Alex Jones comes out against Trump
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.600]  And I do this sarcastic piece where I'm like
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:39.600]  The Communist Chinese are against him
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.600]  The former president of Mexico is against him
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.600]  The Pope is against him
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.600]  Obama is against him
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:45.600]  He says we can't have him
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.600]  The Republicans and the Koch brothers are against him
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.600]  And I go through this whole litany
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.600]  And I say that's it, I'm against Trump
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:51.600]  He's horrible
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.600]  The establishment's right
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.600]  I mean my gosh, he's saying vaccines are dangerous
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:55.600]  And 9-11 truth
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.600]  And sovereigns, he's good
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.600]  And this is so horrible
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:58.600]  Oh my gosh
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:35:59.600]  And then McAdoo comes in
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:00.600]  And basically roughs me up
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.600]  It's not real
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.600]  People think it's actually real
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.600]  It's like Looney Tunes level humor
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.600]  Or Three Stooges ask
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.600]  It's gone super viral
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.600]  I think both videos together
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.600]  It's like a half million views since last night
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.600]  When we shot it live
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.600]  You can see the low-res version up there
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.600]  But under it, I'm going to have them post
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.600]  The high-res YouTube of it
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.600]  So it's pretty funny
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.600]  And Leanne, we talked about like a minute
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.600]  Before we shot it
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:28.600]  She was literally in here
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.600]  About to go out and do a man on the street interview
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.600]  And I said, hey, let's do this
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.600]  She said, sure, sounds fine
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.600]  And it just illustrates how crazy it is
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.600]  To get on the anti-Trump bandwagon
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.600]  It's not that he's perfect
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.600]  But he's the symbol now
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.600]  Of the uprising against the Bush
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.600]  And the Clinton crime family
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.600]  We're going to Wayne Madson
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.600]  Investigative Journalist
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.600]  WayneMadsonReport.com
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.600]  Now, obviously
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.600]  We're going to get into the gay mafia stories
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.600]  That he wrote three years ago
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.600]  A year ago and a week ago
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:57.600]  That got put in the National Enquirer
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.600]  And obviously, we're going to get into that
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  But wow, how vindicated does he feel?
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.600]  Because he went out there
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.600]  And I said, this is near the border
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.600]  Drug dealers
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.600]  He's dead
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.600]  The key Supreme Court justice
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.600]  Antonin Scalia
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.600]  It's connected to Black Ops
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.600]  Obama, a pillow over the head, no autopsy
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:20.600]  And Wayne and Beggs go
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:23.600]  We feel like an occultic bohemian grove thing
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.600]  They even put tweets out in
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.600]  Instagram saying that, both of them
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.600]  And, you know, I feel Dick Cheney's out here
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.600]  And this just really fits with the occult
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.600]  Washington Post last week
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.600]  He died, part of a secret society
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.600]  It plays as a hunting society, no it's not
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600]  It's a spinoff of the Bavarian Illuminati
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.600]  Like skull and bones, like bohemian grove
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.600]  And they admit was founded by bohemian grove
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.600]  Itself a chapter of the Bavarian Illuminati
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.600]  It's a German death cult
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.600]  People always accuse me, the white supremacists
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.600]  Especially they go, you're anti-German
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.600]  You say it's a death cult, you piece of trash
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.600]  Quit bashing Germans
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.600]  If I'm anything, if my Heinz 57
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.600]  Of European lineage and some Native American
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.600]  It is German, I've got more German than me
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.600]  Than anything
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.600]  Bavarian, Alsatian, Prussian
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.600]  I mean, my mom's from the family
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.600]  Both sides, it's almost all Germans
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.600]  My dad's, you know, English and Irish
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:26.600]  And Scottish and American Indian
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.600]  But it's just wild that they spin it all
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:32.600]  I'm not saying Germans run the world
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.600]  And it's a Germanic, I'm saying
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.600]  When you get to the bottom of the barrel
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.600]  Over and over again and do occultism
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.600]  You just keep hitting Germanic death cult
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:41.600]  That's what the Illuminati is
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.600]  And it's in the news, notice, boom
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.600]  So, we'll talk about that with Wayne Madson
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.600]  But it's not a German bashing exercise
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.600]  The Germans were dumb to be suckered into World War II
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.600]  They were set up, it was wrong
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.600]  20 million Germans died
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.600]  Now, let's move on from there
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.600]  The biggest sale in our history
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:03.600]  The leap year, the 29th is coming and gone
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.600]  Now, March 1st, Ida's of March coming up
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.600]  Super Tuesday
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.600]  We have to end it, okay
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.600]  Because 10 items at least have sold out
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.600]  They tell me they're 5 or 6 or set to sell out
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.600]  In the next few hours
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.600]  Some other books, videos, t-shirts
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.600]  But a lot of them are nutraceuticals
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.600]  We can't just be completely run out
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.600]  Because the sale's so good
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.600]  30% off and free shipping
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.600]  Some of these we're losing money on
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.600]  But it does help fund the operation
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.600]  Super shields back in stock and throw plex
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.600]  Which is basically the pill form of
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:32.600]  Super male or female vitality
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.600]  It's excellent, it just came in
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.600]  The truck came in yesterday, limited supply
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.600]  Oxy powder is in
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.600]  A whole bunch of great items, non-GMO seeds
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.600]  They're there, 30% off, free shipping
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.600]  And this is our Super Tuesday sale
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.600]  It has to end tomorrow before showtime
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.600]  It has to because we're going to sell out of everything
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.600]  I had no idea we went this low
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.600]  On the already discounted prices
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.600]  So this would happen, and that's good
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.600]  We're bringing some funds in because we're spending so much money
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.600]  Sending reporters around the country
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.600]  I want to send Wayne to Davos and Bilderberg
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.600]  I want Wayne to go to Bilderberg this year
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.600]  I want to send like five people, I may even go
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.600]  I'm just so busy holding down the four here
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.600]  Believe me, I want to go to Europe
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.600]  So it's good to have that capital
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.600]  Help build this media institution
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.600]  That continues to win, our story about Texas
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.600]  And votes going to Marco Ribio
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.600]  That's on DrudgeReport.com
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.600]  Top of Drudge right now, middle column
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.600]  Point is we're not just effective, we're super effective
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.600]  Thanks to your prayers, your support, you name it
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you to the NutriCiticles
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.600]  InfoWarsStore.com
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.600]  One word is the umbrella site
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.600]  Or call 888-253-3139
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.600]  Go read the rape reviews for yourself
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.600]  Here's a review on LibreShield
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.600]  Lily May in St. Catharines, Ontario
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.600]  I would buy this LibreShield again
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.600]  I use LibreShield every day
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.600]  On the sixth day, and that's when we shoot the cleanse
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.600]  All kinds of black crud came out
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.600]  I'm 63 years old and feel 35 again
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:55.600]  Alex, thanks Alex for your great products
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.600]  Here's another one I'm going to stop plugging
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.600]  InSki in Austin, Texas, LibreShield
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.600]  Feeling great, physically fit, satisfied
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.600]  I use this product daily, tastes great
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.600]  I believe this product is working
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.600]  Always follow the instructions via any product
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:08.600]  For best results
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.600]  And that's another five star review
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.600]  There's thousands of them, tens of thousands
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.600]  For all the products on third party power reviews
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.600]  And that's how we're funding our operation
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.600]  Not with taxpayer money like MSNBC or
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:20.600]  NPR, but with your support
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.600]  Thank you for supporting us
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.600]  And being right beside us, we couldn't do it without you
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.600]  All right, you can go to WayneMadsonReport.com
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.600]  Or infowars.com
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.600]  But WayneMadsonReport.com is a great place to go
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.600]  To find it all archived neatly
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.600]  And here's the headline
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.600]  Cover-up Rubio Establishment, Try to Berry
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:40.600]  Rubio's Gay Past, close quote reports
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  Here's another one, Rubio's Cuban Mafia
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.600]  Connections in Miami-Dade
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.600]  Now, he wrote articles about him years ago
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.600]  In his investigations of Obama and blackmail
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.600]  And I want to be clear because I know Wayne's views on this
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.600]  We're not bashing him, but he's bisexual
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:56.600]  Okay, that's not what we do
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.600]  I'm a libertarian, I am a Christian, I have my own views
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.600]  But I do not judge people
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.600]  As long as you leave people's kids alone
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.600]  Whether you're heterosexual or homosexual, whatever
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.600]  That said, they can blackmail him with this
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.600]  And he's got the Koch brothers behind him
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.600]  The whole power structure behind him
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.600]  It shows that there's some serious issues here
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.600]  We're going to cover that and then get into
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.600]  The Washington Post headline
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.600]  Scalia died in part of a secret society ritual
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.600]  With all that weird satanic garbage everywhere
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.600]  And devil faces
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.600]  We'll roll some of that B-roll once we get to that
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:33.600]  I tell you, Wayne, being on the air 21 years
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.600]  It didn't used to feel like this
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.600]  Now every day feels like outer limits surreal
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.600]  Twilight Zone, are you feeling like that
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:42.600]  In your 30 years as a reporter
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:44.600]  Before that, a high-level officer at the National Security Agency
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.600]  I mean, is this not getting too crazy?
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:49.600]  I've covered a lot of presidential campaigns
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.600]  And this one is almost like Don Rickles
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:55.600]  Running against Rodney Dangerfield
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:58.600]  It is, I've never seen anything like it
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:02.600]  I know in the past candidates would throw some barbs
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:06.600]  But I mean, when we had Marco Rubio in Virginia
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.600]  Just the other day, questioned Donald Trump's hand size
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.600]  And he says, well, you know, guys with small hands
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.600]  You know what that means, no Marco
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.600]  Why don't you let us know?
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:17.600]  I mean, Marco sounds like he's an expert
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.600]  Rubio's an expert on men's member
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.600]  Yeah, he knows how to scope them out
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.600]  He said he was staring at Trump
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:26.600]  Well, in the green room before the Houston debate
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:29.600]  He says, well, I was wondering whether Donald thought he wet his pants
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:32.600]  Well, why was Rubio staring looking for...
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.600]  No, that's an amazing thought, Wayne
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.600]  Why is Rubio obsessed with Donald Trump's package?
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.600]  Here's the headline
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:41.600]  That's the real headline, I think, here
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.600]  You know, he can't contain himself
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.600]  I just, you know, and since I reported Rubio in the phone bath
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.600]  By the way, he's been confirmed that
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.600]  When he was going to those phone parties in South Beach in the 90s
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.600]  In South Beach, they were exclusively gay events
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:02.600]  These people are coming out and saying, oh, I went to a phone party
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.600]  And it wasn't, well, if it's in Poughkeepsie, New York
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.600]  Maybe not, but if it was in South Beach
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:12.600]  Miami, Dade County, Florida, it was
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.600]  And, you know, he's got all these people coming to his defense
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.600]  Well, you've got photos on your site
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.600]  You might direct folks where they go to see those
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.600]  That look like Rubio at these parties
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.600]  Well, that is Rubio
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.600]  See, that's another thing
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.600]  That was a thing they did for his high school
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.600]  But it was so popular in South Beach
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.600]  They took that on the road
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:35.600]  Sure, sure, and that is Rubio
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.600]  Look at his ears
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.600]  Let's go back to him admittedly as a male cheerleader
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:43.600]  Like Bush and Perry and everybody
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.600]  I mean, it's so rare to be a male cheerleader
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.600]  It's known about half of them are usually gay
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.600]  I mean, he's a male cheerleader jumping around in a Chippendales outfit
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.600]  Most of the Chippendales it's known are gay
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.600]  And then, boom, he looks like he's at gay phone parties
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.600]  Explain what phone parties are
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:02.600]  A phone party, they held him at these gay clubs in South Beach
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:05.600]  Where a bunch of gay guys would get on the dance floor
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.600]  And then he would spray foam in
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:08.600]  Where the foam would go
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:13.600]  I said, one photo showed right up to basically their chest level
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:18.600]  And then all kinds of unsavory things would happen underneath the foam
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:21.600]  Now it's been said, he actually said
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.600]  In this case, it's up between their chest and their necks
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.600]  And Rubio said he met his wife at one of these phone parties
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.600]  So I inquired about that
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.600]  And what I got in response was
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:39.600]  A lot of women used to go to these events
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.600]  They were spectators
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:46.600]  And they basically got off on watching these gay guys
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.600]  You know, cavorting in the suds
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:55.600]  Now I think after the Christie endorsement of Trump
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:00.600]  I now understand why Trippie, why Chris Christie
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:04.600]  Kept referring to Marco Rubio as the boy in the bubble
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:06.600]  He said, you gotta get out of the bubble
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:09.600]  I think what he meant was the bubble bath
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.600]  Wow, wow, wow, wow
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.600]  So it looks like he's connected to public sex parties
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.600]  Yeah, not only that
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:22.600]  I just posted this about an hour ago
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:24.600]  Christie is some of his big...
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:26.600]  I mean, I'm sorry, not Christie
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:31.600]  But Rubio is some of his campaign contributors
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.600]  All part of this, what I call a Cuban mafia
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:36.600]  In Miami-Dade County
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:43.600]  They have been seen at Miami's most well-known swingers club
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.600]  Called Miami Velvet
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.600]  Which is only a few exits down the Palmetto Expressway
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:53.600]  From where Rubio established just last week
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.600]  His Florida campaign headquarters
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.600]  Well, I've talked to high-level Republicans
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.600]  And they say the word even before this
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.600]  Is that Rubio's a switch-hitter
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.600]  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, it was well-known
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:09.600]  Back when he was first running for the Florida House of Representatives
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.600]  Of course, he was taken under the wings
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:16.600]  Of a lot of these wealthy Cubans in Miami
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:19.600]  And if you look at their parentage
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.600]  It was like a lot of these guys
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:25.600]  Were part of the Bay of Pigs invasion
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.600]  So this is what we're dealing with here
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:36.600]  And so in 2005 Rubio bought a house for $550,000
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:43.600]  And in 37 days it appreciated something like $185,000
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.600]  To the point where he could then get a home equity loan
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:50.600]  For folks that don't know, that's the classic scam
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.600]  Of Rubio's where you suddenly are able to sell it
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:54.600]  For way more than it's worth
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:57.600]  Well, it's almost a carbon copy of what Obama did
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.600]  With Tony Resko in Chicago when they flipped that real estate
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.600]  Obama's house there
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.600]  Well, now what you first started reporting on
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.600]  Is coming out in the news, they're looking at it very seriously
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:11.600]  Is this damaging him?
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:15.600]  Well, you would think so, but the establishment Republicans
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.600]  Seem to be drifting towards Rubio
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.600]  I see basically as support is coming from the Lonkaban Republicans
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:24.600]  And they try to say that's a minority in the party
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:26.600]  It's no minority
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.600]  I was about to say, I mean, I'm just saying
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:32.600]  Look at Bohemian Grove, Republicans tend to lean more
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:35.600]  Homosexual at the leadership level than Democrats
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.600]  Democrats tend to rape women a lot, I just noticed it
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.600]  They're into women, they like to rape and hurt women
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.600]  I don't know why, they're mainly heterosexual
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.600]  And like to beat women, I'm sure you've noticed that
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.600]  But with the Republicans, it then reveres often to men
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.600]  And men dressing like women
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:53.600]  I mean, I've seen the photo inside Bohemian Grove
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:56.600]  I was there with John Ronson of Henry Kissinger
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:58.600]  Been over shoving his hands in his pants
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:48:59.600]  I'm not going to say what he was doing
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.600]  But I mean, no, Ronson wrote about it in his book
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.600]  How are you going to talk about it until Ronson put it in his book?
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.600]  That's a bad visual on that, I'm just thinking about it
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.600]  It was Kissinger as dressed as a woman
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.600]  With his butt up in the air, yeah
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:15.600]  Yeah, trying to be like Madeline Albright, apparently
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.600]  So I think what we have in Rupia
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.600]  We have a similar situation with Barack Obama
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:25.600]  We got a guy who was born, when he was born in Florida
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.600]  His parents were not American citizens
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.600]  Again, we got an issue here with that natural born caveat
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:35.600]  In the Constitution, what did the founders actually mean?
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.600]  We've never had a decision on that
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.600]  I think that Scalia, if he were still on the court
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:44.600]  He would have had a very strict interpretation
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.600]  I agree, let's come back and talk about Scalia
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.600]  And then one more segment after that with you
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.600]  But getting back, I don't mean to say gross things on there
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:52.600]  I don't normally, we're talking about world figures
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:54.600]  We're talking about things that are being said and done
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:55.600]  Rubio's talking about his hand size
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.600]  And you know what that means
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.600]  So we have to go there
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:00.600]  Because these are grown men talking about this at a level never before seen
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.600]  So I talk about what I saw at Bohemian Grove
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:04.600]  And I never told anybody until Ronson wrote his book
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:07.600]  And I said no, I was with him, Ronson didn't want it known until the book came out
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.600]  That he was there with me
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:10.600]  Then it was spun like I lied who was with me
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:11.600]  No, it was called being a journalist
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:14.600]  But correct me if I'm wrong, because you study this as well
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.600]  Doesn't it seem Democrats lean more hetero
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:18.600]  But claim they're more pro-gay
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.600]  But then they tend to abuse women
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:21.600]  And I see him killing more women
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.600]  Look at the Pope with the dead woman
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.600]  He's more of a liberal
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:28.600]  Have you found overall covering Capitol Hill for 30 years
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.600]  That that's an accurate generalization?
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.600]  Yeah, what I found is Democrats largely
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:35.600]  It's when they get caught in a sex scandal
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.600]  It's with a member of the opposite sex
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:39.600]  When it's Republicans
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:42.600]  It's usually a member of the same sex
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.600]  And the ones, the Republicans that wake up in the morning
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.600]  And they're worried there's gays in their closet
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.600]  Under their bed and around the corner
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:52.600]  These are the guys that are usually the ones that get caught
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:53.600]  But am I right Sting, though?
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.600]  A lot of the Democrats like to beat women, though
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.600]  Oh, yeah, there's been a lot of cases there
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.600]  Yeah, they're into bondage and stuff
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:00.600]  We'll be back
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:01.600]  Are you prepared to bug out
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.600]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger

[01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:10.600]  Alright, I want to get into Scalia with our guest Wayne Madsen in this segment and the next
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.600]  Then we have Patrick Wood, who's written a very important book on the technocracy
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:19.600]  To understand where we're all really going, we'll have updates on what's unfolding in the latest news as well, interspersed
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:30.600]  And in the fourth hour, obviously, we're going to have open phones with David Knight, and then we're going to try to take calls tonight, off and on during our four hours plus live coverage
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.600]  That's going to be taking place, kicking off 7 o'clock Central Time in Full Wars
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:42.600]  News.com takes you over to the Nightly News, but the feeds are free for everybody at infowars.com forward slash show
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:49.600]  Wayne, looking at this election, just briefly, and what you see happening with Trump
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:55.600]  I think a lot of it is, he's never been in the insider billionaire club, he has always been a maverick, whether he's good or bad
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:01.600]  He's extremely heterosexual, I know people that know him up in New York
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:05.600]  I would expect down the road that's something they're going to raise, you know, the fact that he's pepula pew
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:11.600]  But he's never really covered any of that up, he's not really hiding it, so what power does that have over him?
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:15.600]  What else do you expect him to do, and what's your view of Trump right now as things stand?
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:26.600]  Well, I mean, I think tonight we're going to see the sort of the Trump Express continuing to bulldoze through the Republican establishment
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:38.600]  What I'm hearing is, in Virginia, turnout is considered very high for a primary election, and that may be Republicans coming out to vote there
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:43.600]  By the way, that's an open primary, so you can have crossover votes
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:50.600]  And there's a lot of, especially in southwest Virginia, that's where you'll find a lot of the old quote unquote Reagan Democrats
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:56:05.600]  This was a coal mining area where, you know, there's a lot of blighted cities and towns there, but of course that anti-free trade rhetoric from Trump is going to play very well there
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:13.600]  I understand that turnout is also very high in Georgia, so he's expected to carry both Georgia and Virginia
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:26.600]  I think the states to watch are the ones where Cruz was either ahead comfortably or slightly, and that would be Texas and also Arkansas
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:38.600]  Rubio, as we know, hasn't won anything yet, he might win Minnesota, but we'll have to see, Trump was very, very close behind him in the polls there
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:47.600]  So we'll also have to see how this sort of dirty trick about trying to link in with David Duke is going to play out
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:54.600]  My feeling is, I think voters are smarter than that, and they know how the media gets onto these stories
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:57:01.600]  Well, he's already come out and repudiated on Twitter, and years ago did it, but they keep saying he needs to repudiate
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:07.600]  People always say that to me, they go, you need to repudiate that you work for ABC News, or you need to repudiate you work for the Koch Brothers
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:11.600]  Never work for ABC News, never got anything from the Koch Brothers
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:17.600]  Well, you need to repudiate it again to me, and that's reportedly what I've been told to the folks that know Trump, he's like, I've done it, I'm done
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:23.600]  I'm not doing what they want anymore, because he goes, next it'll be repudiate this, repudiate that, and then he's out there apologizing
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:27.600]  I don't know if that strategy is right, part of me tells me it's smart, other part tells me it's dumb
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:35.600]  Well, it's a straw man, they throw up there, you know, they want to get them to go after it, and it happens in a lot of these campaigns
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:43.600]  But if he wins, there's 11 states either voting in the primary or caucusing
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:50.600]  If he wins, I'd say 9 of those, I think there's no way they're going to stop him
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:58.600]  If he wins 350 delegates, which is a low number, and the other two split 300, and the others get like 30, then I think he clearly is the nominee
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:03.600]  Yeah, because then the next ones are Ohio and Florida, and they're both winner-take-all
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:08.600]  And if he wins, he's ahead in Florida, he's also slightly ahead of Kasich in his home state
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:12.600]  Sure, sure, and that's where the real fraud we're told is going on against him
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.600]  What do you make of the Ides of March option? That's the next primary
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:19.600]  I'm afraid they're going to go after him physically, the New York Times called for his death
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:30.600]  You know, as someone who was pretty young at the time, and I was up watching in the morning, Robert Kennedy's, you know, I turned on the TV
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:34.600]  And he's giving us, like, we're going to go on to Chicago and win the nomination
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:37.600]  Hold on, stay there, I'm going to let you host the next five minutes
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:42.600]  We're going to come back and let you segue out of the assassination of Trump, if they try it, into what happened with the Secret Society
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:45.600]  And Scalia, you've got the next five minutes, you're going to host it
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:50.600]  I want to watch what you have to say, but I've got emergency news to research here, so you're taking over for five

[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:42.600]  And finally, from yours truly, Alex Jones, to all the patriots of every race, color, and creed across this country and the world
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:49.600]  I salute you for your tireless fight against tyranny and your support of the InfoWars, without you, none of this is possible
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:55.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:05.600]  All right, I'm going to hand the baton for the next five minutes to Wayne Madsen to get into all this talk of assassinating Trump, New York Times writer coming out
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:14.600]  People on the street calling for it, we've talked to, now that ties into Scalia and the bizarre Bohemian Grove, Scullin' Bones, Braverian Illuminati connected group
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:26.600]  In the Washington Post admitting that, again, Twilight Zone is here, Wayne Madsen
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:39.600]  Well, Alex, I mean, it's absolutely the case, what we have now is a situation where Trump is having to deal with protesters
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:50.600]  There was an altercation just yesterday in Virginia between a photographer and a Secret Service agent protecting Trump
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:59.600]  So obviously, Secret Service agents are getting very worried now, and they only get worried when they're getting intelligence on people near due wells
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:03.600]  People that they're tracking showing up on the campaign trail
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:17.600]  Now, I covered the Donald Trump rally in Tampa, and I can tell you that Secret Service was very emphatic that once the candidate comes into the area, the arena or wherever it's being held
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:28.600]  The press is in sort of a walled off area with these mental fences, and we're not to step out of those, even though we have press passes, we're not to step out of those
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:34.600]  So what happened apparently was this photographer stepped out of that area, and there was an altercation
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:40.600]  So, you know, they're trying to say, well, this is a case where Trump is going to beat up on members of the press
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:44.600]  Trump didn't call the shots on that one, that was the Secret Service
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:50.600]  You basically, even when you're a candidate, you deal with the Secret Service tells you to do
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:58.600]  And that's a very important aspect of now all these candidates getting Secret Service protection
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:06.600]  Everybody's got to follow the rules, but as far as the Antonin Scalia situation
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:22.600]  That's the Bola Creek Ranch did not pass any smell test with all this sort of a cult of artifacts around in the dining room, in the passageway where Scalia's suite was located
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:30.600]  There was just too much of it, and now we find out about the international order St. Hubertus, which I have never heard of
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:40.600]  But it's tied in with all these other Secret Orders, Catholic Secret Orders, Knights of Malta type stuff
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:52.600]  And you can see in here, this was a figurine statuette that was not too far outside of Scalia's room where he is said to have died of a heart attack
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:03:04.600]  And this international order is St. Hubertus, their patron is the former king of Spain Juan Carlos, a corrupt king who was actually run out of office
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:16.600]  He was forced to advocate, and one of the things that led to that was a photograph of King Juan Carlos standing in front of a dead elephant that had been shot by his hunting party
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:24.600]  And he was like the head of all these wildlife preservation groups, the elephant and endangered species
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:32.600]  And here the head of that Secret Society is pictured in front of a dead endangered species elephant
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:46.600]  So this is what we're dealing with, this St. Hubertus Society, this Get Together, how many of these are run by this guy that owns the ranch, John B. Poindexter, we don't know
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:52.600]  We know the identities of two other people who were there at the time at this event, a baby crib
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:04:15.600]  And that was so out of place at this particular ranch which hosts mainly stag events, although my sources told me that at least one prostitute was sighted at the Sabolo Creek Ranch, not when Scalia was there, but in past gatherings sponsored by this owner, John Poindexter
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:24.600]  And Wayne, for me, it's the fact that we know Scullin' Bones was founded in 1832 out of the Bavarian Illuminati, that's in the Encyclopedia
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:31.600]  And then they found the Bohemian Grove, it was founded by Mark Twain and others, but it got taken over by 1900 by Taft, a Scullin' Bones, or they kicked them out
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:36.600]  And then this group, it says, brought this group back to life
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:43.600]  So it sounds like it's a satellite of that, I mean you couldn't make this up in a Stephen King novel, Waynemasterreport.com
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:48.600]  Thank you so much for the time, we'll be checking in with you, I hope you can join us tonight too, later in the evening

[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:47.600]  In 2015, the British Home Secretary Theresa May admitted that a 1983 Telecom Act permitted bulk retention of data by MI5
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:51.600]  And the agency has done so since September 2001

[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:27.600]  Despite all my rage, I still just ran away
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:33.600]  But someone will save what is lost and never be saved
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:52.600]  Despite all my rage, I still just ran away
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:09:03.600]  It's the day after the whitest show on earth, Oscars so white, I just want to find out what people thought of that lecture fest
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:08.600]  Is the Oscars racist and how weird is that because it's all liberals
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:16.600]  Well, I'm here at the Academy Awards, otherwise known as the White People's Choice Awards
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:24.600]  You're wondering about people's opinion on the Oscars, the Oscars so white, did you tune in, what do you think about that?
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:29.600]  I didn't tune in, I'm a film major and I didn't tune in and protest for it
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:36.600]  So I don't know what happened at all, I've been reading articles all day on Facebook and the results were less than satisfactory
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:38.600]  So of course they were, that's why I didn't watch them
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:45.600]  I'm not really interested anymore in what goes on and I'm kind of interested to see where the actors and things of that sort go this year
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.600]  With how they do their movies and their work, so we'll stay tuned for next year
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:58.600]  And so he also pointed out, this is the 88th year where a 71, at least other years, there haven't been any other black actors nominated
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:01.600]  So why this year?
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:06.600]  I think, you know why this year is so much controversy? I think people are just finally upset
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:15.600]  I think with Trey Monmartre and all that stuff, restarting this year, not just that it just started happening again, but restarting in the media this year
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:20.600]  I think people are just above all years fed up, so I think that's where the frustration comes from
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:23.600]  People are finally just like, you know what, this is ridiculous
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:28.600]  Yeah, I watched the beginning where Chris Brock was talking
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:31.600]  And what, did you agree with his monologue?
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:39.600]  I do feel like we should boycott, because I mean, then we would boycott a lot of things, but I do feel like there hasn't been a lot of black nominees and really anything
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:45.600]  And I do feel like it should change, I guess, maybe, I'm kind of saying it because I am black, but yeah
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:52.600]  You see all these writers and producers and actors, they don't hire black people
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:59.600]  And they're the nicest white people on earth, they're liberals, jeez
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:03.600]  Do you think we should boycott that? Do you think Hollywood is racist?
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:10.600]  No, I don't think Hollywood is racist, I think that they're just choosing what they think is best
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:12.600]  I hope so
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:13.600]  As far as the films?
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:22.600]  As far as the films go, yeah, I think it was finally deserved for Leonardo DiCaprio, so I'm a big fan, so I think that he deserved it
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:31.600]  Absolutely, do you agree, though, with what Chris Brock said when he said, you know, we're here in liberal Hollywood, like you guys are supposed to be the nice white people
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:34.600]  Why aren't you giving us good roles?
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:44.600]  Yeah, I guess that's very true, I mean, I guess that Hollywood already has kind of predestined roles for black people, I guess, because I feel like black people play the same kind of roles in the movies
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:49.600]  But, I don't know, maybe some people will push the boundaries of that
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:58.600]  I'd imagine there's racism everywhere, honestly, I mean, I don't follow the Oscars that much, I'm just glad Leo finally got one, I can say that much
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:08.600]  What did you think about the fact that he used his one Oscar-winning shot to talk to people about climate change, and it seemed to be a very politically motivated event last season?
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:18.600]  He's always been that kind of guy, though, like I'm pretty sure he also has his own charity for things like that as well, so it's good to see that at least someone in Hollywood actually cares about what's going on with other people
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:21.600]  Other than their money
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:32.600]  Hollywood is sorority racist, it's like, we like you Ronda, but you're not a capo
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:35.600]  Do you think that Hollywood is racist?
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:47.600]  Yeah, yeah, no, I definitely do, and I don't think it's just about like people not getting nominated, it's also about there not being opportunities for black people
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:55.600]  There aren't stories given from the black narrative and whatnot
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:59.600]  What about Asian actors or like Indian actors?
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:09.600]  No, I mean, clear across the board, any other minority other than the majority, which is white, I think there should be more representation
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:20.600]  First of all, I don't even like Oscars anymore, I grew up in the old days, okay, I grew up when it comes to the romantic era, so to say
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:34.600]  I don't know any of the controversies, because first of all, I don't want to give them any power, because when we thrust all this energy into the negative, the negative becomes more powerful, more solid
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:43.600]  As Alex Jones many times talks about, okay, so when it comes to them, they're always going to have an agenda, but you don't want it to be better than that
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:49.600]  Because we stand together as crowd, and if they want to create controversies or whatever, they're going to do it one way or another
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:14:07.600]  Now, we have Patrick Wood joining us, a best-get reporter researcher about his new book, Technocracy Rising with Rogin Horse of Global Transformation, this is so key, but his Skype just drops, we're going to him in a moment
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:28.600]  Some of the big news that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now is obviously extremely important, media savages Trump over Duke, Ignorance Hillary, praising former KKK member Robert Byrd
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:38.600]  And I just want to tell you, in the next 48 hours, we're set to have a very big guest on air dealing with all of this, I'm just going to leave that as it is, and probably in studio
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:15:00.600]  So you want to watch this feed, whether it's on a local AM and FM station, UHF, VHF, cable, whether you download the podcast or listen on the free iPhone or Droid apps, and then FullWars.com forward slash show, but you want to go there and get those free apps, get those links, and send those to everybody you know on a routine basis, that's how we're exploding
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:09.600]  I'm risking my name, my treasure, and everything doing this, because there's no future if we don't, so please don't praise me, but I do want to win, I am committed
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:33.600]  So that is unfolding as well. Report Trump supporters in Texas, see votes switched to Rubio, that's being reported by News and TV now, and we've got reports being posted into our article as we speak, leafing it up, adding more research as it develops to the article linked topMiddleColumnDrudgeReport.com
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:47.600]  You want to get that out there so people know what they're watching for, and so that people that it happens to don't feel alone, and so we build a momentum to expose fraud ahead of the Ides of March 15th event
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:58.600]  Trump is also called on Rubio to drop out, little Marco Rubio, let me tell you, he has been a disaster for Florida, Trump said, that's from ABC
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:16.600]  National Review says Jeff Sessions is a prostitute for endorsing Donald Trump, who was against the TPP, the NAU, and these other sovereignty destroying situations like open borders, I mean, there's no country if you don't have that, that's a globalist plan
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:35.600]  And now National Review that's coming, this is one of the most respected paleo-conservative senators there are, nobody says this guy is anything but honorable, he even said Donald Trump didn't perfectly disagree with him on some things, but he's right about sovereignty, he's right about borders, he's right about the TPP, just exactly what David Knight keeps saying
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:52.600]  And nobody else is out there really doing that, so it's a big deal, even Newt Genners has come out in Politico and said, Trump's unstoppable, need to get behind him, all this fraternal fighting, all this infighting,
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:17:09.600]  Fratricide is not the word, it's only going to get hair Hillary elected, and look if you don't like Trump and don't trust him, I'm not mad at you, don't be mad at me if I don't support Hillary or Bernie Sanders, I've done the research though, and I don't usually put everything on a presidential candidate and I still don't, I say get good states elected,
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:24.600]  good governors elected, good legislatures, vote with your dollars, what you buy, that's how you change culture, now I wanted to have this guest on, Nico asked me a few days ago, he said you still want to have Patrick Wood on with all this huge election news,
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:39.600]  or we're making national news every hour or so, just with what we're doing here in the Info War, what you're doing, you're the real power of this operation, he said you want to move it next week or something, and I said no, technocracy is the most important issue,
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:54.600]  and people need to understand why we shouldn't be fighting with each other, we need to understand what we're facing as a culture, what we're facing as a society, and that it needs to happen sooner rather than later, and to understand there is a global government of technocrats that have formed a plan,
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:18:09.600]  and they're integrating it, we're already probably 70% into this radical transformation, and it's designed to end human individualism, where humans can actually be sustainable, so it's the opposite of sustainability, they call it sustainability,
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:22.600]  and it's all been announced by the Davos and the Bilderberg and the Club of Rome, what they're bringing in, so I really appreciate Mr. Wood, Patrick and Wood for coming on with us, this is election time, I've been cutting back on skipping breaks, but I am skipping this one,
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:34.600]  technocracy rising, the Trojan horse of global transformation, Patrick and Wood, I told him when I read the book, I want to carry it, I don't even know if we're carrying it in for a store, doesn't matter, just get the book, aren't we carrying it?
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:44.600]  The dark horse of the New World Order is not communism, socialism or fascism, when I have this special guest in the studio, I think I'm going to read this to him, it is technocracy, yes, yes,
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:19:00.600]  started in the 30s, it's really eugenics from 1855, and reintroduced by the Trial Law Commission in 1973 as the new international economic order, that's in the technotronic era by Brzezinski, co-founder of the Trial Law Commission, it is now known by names like sustainable development and green economy,
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:16.600]  and it goes over it, folks, this is what Agent 21 is, one Swiss army knife blade of, you need this book, I read it in two days, and quite frankly I knew everything in it, but almost no one else does, that's what's so frustrating,
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:30.600]  it's super accurate, it ties it all together, it's 100% true from my research, and what's scary is, in-game is one of the only other things out there, it's free online, three hour long film by the DVD at m4store.com that breaks this down, the book does it in even more detail,
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:48.600]  and it's updated, I made the in-game eight years ago, so I want to carry this book if we're not carrying it, that's a message to my crew, because we do most of the stuff just on air, most of the planning is on air, and pair it with technocracy, because you know the iPhones and iPads, Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids use them, they were brain damaging everybody,
[02:19:48.600 --> 02:20:07.600]  they know that, we know they've already put modems in Trip's brains 20 years ago, and have cross-human animal chimeras 30 years ago, and now they announced it last week, it's in the medical papers, it's in the MIT stuff for the academics, PhDs, but the general public doesn't know there's a whole breakaway civilization,
[02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:21.600]  what I know about is 30 years old, and most people can't even believe it when I tell them, we are not in Kansas anymore, we are in a science fiction movie, and it's run by technocrats who are eugenicists, or social Darwinists,
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:34.600]  and you better find out what those terms are, because you can forget, that's why I don't want to fight with David Duker, Lewis Farrakhan, and let George Soros stir us up, he's a technocrat, he plays everybody off against each other, he's totally cold-blooded,
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:45.600]  he was a Nazi collaborator now, he's a socialist, he's really a billionaire, he destroys countries, they're devils, and I know it's fun to be tribal and fight with each other, it feels good, we're designed to do it,
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:55.600]  but the big invisible takeover, or almost invisible takeover, is coming for everybody, so that's my message, and that's what I'm trying to get across to people,
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:21:08.600]  but I'm going to stop now, and go to our guest, amazing book, we've got to get Patrick Woodall, he's only been on it a few times, and I always say, why is he on more, I need to remember this, because he's such a great brain,
[02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:20.600]  he's an author and lecturer who has studied elite globalization policy since the late 70s, when he partnered with the late Anthony C Sutton, that was the top congressional investigator at the church committees and all of it,
[02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:31.600]  to co-author trilaterals over Washington volume one and two, he remains a leading expert on the elite trilateral commission, their policies and achievements in creating their self-proclaimed new international economic order,
[02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:45.600]  an economist by education, a finance analyst and writer by profession, and an American constitutional by choice, Wood has deep historical insights in the modern attacks and sovereignty, I'm going to stop right there, but he joins us right now,
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:55.600]  and so much of what we know about today is from him and Anthony Sutton, and of course, Charlotte Issaaby that leaked him the information, so it's great to have him here with us today, on the same day we had Phyllis Schlaffling on,
[02:21:55.600 --> 02:22:06.600]  Mr. Wood, thank you so much for coming on, we've got nine minutes or eight minutes to break, you've got the floor to start with what's currently happening, or where it began, or why technocracy is so important,
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:16.600]  I mean, how do we raise the alarm for people out there that it's game over, you know, you want to say it's the Vatican or the Jews or the whatever's that run everything and all this stuff, it's the technocrats,
[02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:21.600]  and they've got a religion and it means we're dead in the end, sir.
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:26.600]  Well, there's two things that are played here, Alex, and thank you for having me on, I do appreciate it.
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:27.600]  Thank you, sir.
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:45.600]  You know, the Constitution, which was written by, of course, the founding fathers of our country, was a system, we need to look at it as a system, because all of the writers are dead now, but the system lived on, and it was a great system of checks and balances,
[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:54.600]  that would corral society into something that would be good for the people in the long run, and we can understand that, I think, pretty simple terms.
[02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:59.600]  What's happening today is that another system is being created.
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:02.600]  That is the system of technocracy.
[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:20.600]  The people who are bringing it to us are indeed, as you exclaim, the technocrats or technocrats in general, and it's hard to get your hand, get a head around this, but the system is not primarily politically driven.
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:26.600]  It's driven by economics. I think this is one reason it's missed everybody's radar.
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:33.600]  Economics is boring. You know, you think of Ben Stein, you know, like, well, you know, it's just boring stuff like that.
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:47.600]  People just, or Alan Greenspan, people just don't respond to economics, but this has been an economic coup of global proportions, and all of the things we're talking about, green economy, sustainable development,
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:53.600]  those sorts of things that are being pushed by the United Nations today are all economic terms.
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:24:10.600]  The fact that you have to have some system controlling it or some layer of governance, not government, but governance controlling it is almost incidental to the fact that it's a new economic system being put into place.
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:20.600]  That's key. They're forcing us into a total new system that's artificial that they control the inputs of. That is full spectrum dominance in the Pentagon's own words.
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:33.600]  It really is. And if we go back to the 1930s and let technocrats speak for themselves, here's how the technocrat magazine defined technocracy in 1938.
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:54.600]  That was four years after its founding in New York City. This is the direct quote. It said, technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population.
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:25:08.600]  That's it in a nutshell. That's what they wanted to do then. And that's exactly what's happening now. And as we read things like the 2030 agenda document that was released last, well, at the beginning of winter of last year.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:16.600]  And that's the 2.0 upgrade for the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Global Goals, it's in the 21.
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:29.600]  That's exactly right. As you look at that document, you see all of the utopian promises. You see, we're going to end poverty everywhere. We're going to provide jobs with dignity for everyone.
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:42.600]  We're going to have lifelong learning opportunities and all the wonderful stuff. But if you go down into the fine print and look at what they actually want to do.
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:58.600]  The cost of that, according to the United Nations, their document, not mine, not yours, you get down on the fine print and all we have to do is turn over 100% of the means of production and consumption.
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:01.600]  That's all. That's all they ask for.
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:18.600]  The computers programmed by the elite, the technocrats, in their own words, program our entire lives, the end of free will, just like the Soviets advertised in Russia, but also in China, in the 30s, 40s, 50s, heavenly spaceships, living forever, not having to work.
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:20.600]  Of course, that didn't really happen.
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:31.600]  Well, none of it has ever worked. The dream of utopia has just been a myth. I don't know why anybody would even entertain it today, except they still want a free lunch.
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:42.600]  My mama told me early on, there's no such thing as free lunch. Yours probably did too. But people are still grasping at this stuff by the billions around the world.
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:53.600]  I think it's the greatest thing that ever happened to them, and they're going to get a shock as they feel the manacle tighten around their neck.
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:57.600]  Obama said you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:13.600]  Well, whatever is prescribed by science, quote unquote, will be what's dictated. And science is, of course, the great God at this point for these people, because if science says something is true, well, it must be true.
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:23.600]  Al Gore told us that time and time again as science is settled, and you just need to believe me. And if you don't believe me, you're a denier. And if you're a denier, you deserve to be punished.
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:40.600]  Well, of course, the grand poo-baw of these guys is Galton, and then by 1900 things to come with, of course, H.G. Wells, head of the Fabian Society, who literally talks about world government bombers going and nuking everyone.
[02:27:40.600 --> 02:27:46.600]  Bertrand Russell called for this, who didn't submit to planetary government. When they attack you and conquer you, though, it's for peace.
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:53.600]  And then they basically end the family, raise everybody in incubators like Brave New World, which Huxley admitted was actually real science that they were planning.
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:28:00.600]  And then the elite literally, the dream of Plato, is realized that the state raises us like animals.
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:09.600]  That, honestly, that's it. And the definition I read earlier of technocracy is exactly that. The science of social engineering. Well, what's social engineering?
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:23.600]  It means that somebody else is going to tell you what you can and cannot do. That's social engineering. And doing it as a science project, using the scientific method and using systems theory and stuff like that,
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:30.600]  you know, that puts you in a straight jacket because there's no compassion in science. There's no compassion. There's no feeling.
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:40.600]  But then they're not even honest with the public that they're establishing a total world government with Trojan Horse surveillance and everything and total control. And then we see what the technocracy is doing.
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:46.600]  It's making us poor. It's making us dumb. It's dehumanizing us. Boy, this is not a good road to go down.
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:29:01.600]  Well, it isn't. No, that's why we're screaming bloody murder out here in Arizona right now over this. We have literally declared war on technocracy as an ideology and the people that are promoting technocracy around the world.
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:12.600]  And by the way, in virtually every community in America today, there's some amount of agenda 21 and sustainable development being applied in local communities.
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:19.600]  So, you know, people also picks winners and losers. What it really is is a high tech form of feudalism in their own words, as you know, it is.
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:33.600]  And so, you know, people, people have an opportunity to rise up in their own locales and their own towns and cities and whatever and take these people to task anywhere you find this ideology, slap it, slap it down.
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:39.600]  And, you know, you can't, you can get rid of politicians, but technocrats are not politicians.
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:45.600]  Think about how they've dug in and how we dig them out because they play games in the New York Times like saying there is no agenda 21.
[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:51.600]  There isn't. It doesn't exist. None of this is real. But that game doesn't work anymore. August forecast.com.
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:30:10.600]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:30.600]  Secret archive uncovered through a search warrant executed in August, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, who announced the findings.
[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:37.600]  These predators desecrated a sacred trust and preyed upon their victims in the very places where they should have felt most safe.
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:45.600]  Kane said in a statement, just as troubling is the cover up perpetrated by clergy leaders that allow this abuse to continue for decades.
[02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:55.600]  No criminal charges are being filed in the case because some abusers have died. The statute of limitations has expired and in some cases the victims are too traumatized to testify.
[02:30:55.600 --> 02:31:01.600]  She said you can find more reports on infowars.com.
[02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:12.600]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:21.600]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:25.600]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:35.600]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:50.600]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:59.600]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:11.600]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in. No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:19.600]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies. You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:32:51.600 --> 02:33:20.600]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:46.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us here today. Our guest is with us another 15 minutes.
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:57.600]  Then I'm going to get into the economic news, political news I haven't covered yet, but I really want to get Mr. Wood here in studio sometime or make a documentary around his book,
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:17.600]  Technocracy Rising, the Trojan Horse of Global Transformation. What's crazy, he has hundreds of quotes, their own documents, their statements, which I've seen before and read. Some of them I haven't seen, so I guess I did learn a lot from it. The point is, I know this book to be true from their own words and you can find it at augustforecast.com or Amazon.
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:32.600]  But they're building a world that dominates us and totally controls us and now when they appoint presidents and prime ministers in Europe, Goldman Sachs does at the top of the technocratic pyramid.
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:41.600]  They just say, oh, it's scientific. That's like the UN supported New York Times supported zeitgeist movement. A computer decides when you eat what you do and where you live.
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:49.600]  And then they're teaching British school kids in their megaopolis cartoons that we decide where you work, what you do and you get meat one day a year.
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:57.600]  But the elite though, they're all out to be rich and powerful and fry around on jumbo jets. So it is an Elysium system and it must be resisted.
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:12.600]  Before I go any further, I want to just remind listeners that we ran the biggest sale in our history through the weekend until yesterday and was the most successful ever in gross sales, but not so much even in profit because things were discounted so much.
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:22.600]  But it still helped us find the operation. A bunch of the items, books, videos, t-shirts, nutraceuticals sold out like superfemale vitality and other things.
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:36.600]  But a lot of the items are still there. And so we're now calling it the Super Tuesday sale. Now, everything still in stock is discounted with the biggest sales numbers ever.
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:44.600]  It's just that not everything is still available, but the non GMO high quality, storeable foods discounted 30% and free shipping orders about $50 unprecedented.
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:56.600]  We have the Nutropic Brain Force. We have Anthroplex, which works synergistically with superfemoral superfemoral vitality to get your hormones in balance according to the research.
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:06.600]  Simply incredible grave reviews and a whole bunch of other great items, liver shield, the liver cleanse, gallbladder cleanse, the oxy powders back in stock and so much more.
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:16.600]  But Anthroplex is now back in InfowarsLife.com to find the nutraceuticals, but for the whole umbrella store, InfowarsStore.com.
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:22.600]  And again, that special will end because we're going to sell out what's like 12 or 13 things. It was 10 things last hour.
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:27.600]  It was 12 or 13 things that are sold. That'll be 20 or 30 items best selling items that are sold out by tomorrow.
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:33.600]  And I've just got to keep some stuff back for people that are signed up for auto ship because that can never sell out.
[02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:43.600]  We have to hold back enough so anytime you sign up for auto ship, something that's sold out will still be available because we keep a little surplus in there.
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:49.600]  And you get 10% off as well when you sign up for auto ship at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:37:01.600]  You can find all the great vitamins and minerals and supplements and nutraceuticals as well that we don't produce but are also very high quality at InfowarsHealth.com.
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.600]  And that's the Ungevity Products, our InfowarsTeam.com.
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:11.600]  But we are InfowarsLife.com and of course InfowarsStore.com.
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:18.600]  The joint formulas back in stock, Secret 12, I'm told is sold out. Just a lot of stuff is selling out as we speak.
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:26.600]  Whether it's a Hillary for present t-shirt or a big old group of non-GMO seeds at the highest quality, lowest price, it's fantastic.
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:36.600]  You can see technocracy is about every plant, every seed, every animal being engineered where it couldn't naturally reproduce and live without the computerized technocracy.
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:43.600]  So it's a computerized takeover of reality and creation. It's an elite playing god. Boy, it sounds like something out of revelations.
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:54.600]  All right, you've got the floor for the next 10 minutes. I'm not going to interrupt. Patrick M. Wood has put out the Masterwork Technocracy Rising that everyone should get.
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:59.600]  We're not even selling it yet. You really should get it to understand what you and your family and all of us are up against.
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:05.600]  So how to identify it, how to stop it, what it is, what its in-game is. Patrick M. Wood, you've got the floor.
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:13.600]  We'll take care of that, Alex. And I do hope you will interact as well. I want to stress the importance.
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:19.600]  I know you've covered a lot of other stuff over time on your program, but I want to stress the economic aspect of this again.
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:33.600]  And the reason is that America was made great based on its economic model of private property, free enterprise, and then later what we now call capitalism.
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:41.600]  And yes, it has problems. Everybody knows it does. There's excesses. There's collusion. There's corruption. Those things are not right.
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:50.600]  They need to be, you know, written out of the system. But if it were not for our economic system, since the founding of our country,
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:56.600]  we would not be where we are today. You would not have a studio. You would not have a store online.
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:02.600]  I would not have a house to live in, probably, nor maybe not even have the money to live in a house.
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:12.600]  I'd probably be farming somewhere, you know, on somebody's back 40 where you say, you can have these three acres to do something, but you've got to give me 90% of whatever you produce.
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:15.600]  That's called the dark ages. That's where we're headed.
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:21.600]  So technology is not bad, but they've hijacked it and are building it to create a new feudalism, as you were just saying.
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:29.600]  That's exactly right. I am not anti-technology. I love technology. I made my living off of technology for an entire career.
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:34.600]  So I am not, and I'm not anti-scientist, and I'm not anti-engineer.
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:40.600]  There are many good scientists and good engineers who are not bought into this idea of controlling the world.
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:47.600]  In other words, they don't want to be social engineers. If they're physicists, they want to be physicists, and they want to, you know, they do good work.
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:58.600]  But these technocrats that get this idea in their head that they're somehow better than everybody else, and their science is somehow the gospel truth that everybody needs to obey.
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:09.600]  This is nuts. But listen, last year, Christiana Figueres, who's stepping down, by the way, as the head of climate change at the United Nations,
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:16.600]  she said this in last year at a press conference, get this, guys, quote,
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:29.600]  this is the first time in the history of mankind that we're setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:35.600]  that has been raining for at least 150 years since the Industrial Revolution.
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:42.600]  Let that sink in. You don't need to read between the lines. She went on to say, and she understands the issue here.
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:57.600]  She went on to say, quote, this is probably the most difficult task we've ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:04.600]  This is huge, absolutely huge.
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:18.600]  And people need to understand that these technocrats, if you will, are intending to completely take over the economic system and replace it with something that has never been tried,
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:29.600]  never been proven, never been analyzed by anybody with the same mind, and this is what they intend to do with us.
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:34.600]  Please continue. Your skype throws them. Your audio is coming across great, Patrick, because this is their own admissions.
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:39.600]  Your book is just full of it. What's crazy is they admit all this so nakedly.
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:44.600]  When I've talked to some of these elitists on and off air, they go, we'll see the publics who don't even care.
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:50.600]  They deserve to be overwritten phased out. We're merging with machines. We're gods. You won't stop us. You know, Ray Kurzweil.
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:59.600]  And you just sit here and look at it. It's so selfish, their attitude, but then they sell collectivism to get standardization and control.
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:04.600]  I mean, this really is the final trap for humanity. We've got to escape this. Please continue.
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:14.600]  Well, I like to use the catchphrase that the inmates have taken over the asylum.
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:21.600]  And in a very real way, these people look normal. They wear suits and ties, many of them.
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:30.600]  Some of them wear flip flops and jeans in the tech industry, but these people look normal on the outside.
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:40.600]  But on the inside, Alex, their brains are just fried and they come up with this cockeyed stuff and nobody questions it.
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:46.600]  You know, it's full of logical disconnects, it's full of holes, and yet nobody challenges these people.
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:55.600]  You know, amongst their peers, it's like incredible to me that people don't see through this as the biggest scam in human history.
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:04.600]  And what's being offered to the world by the United Nations now, sustainable development and the green economy, if you will,
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:13.600]  all of this plan originally came from policies set by the Trilateral Commission back in the 1970s and 80s.
[02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:20.600]  This is incredible. You can look at the book Our Common Future. I don't have the video up, so I guess I can't show that.
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:28.600]  But Our Common Future was written by a lady by the name of, or at least architected by a lady by the name of Gro Bruntland,
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:34.600]  who chaired the Bruntland Commission in the 1980s, terminated 1987.
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:43.600]  This book was the book that set the tone for Agenda 21 in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro.
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:48.600]  This book was architected by Gro Bruntland, who was a member of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:53.600]  She was the head of the committee, she steered the whole committee, she steered the book,
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:44:02.600]  and Our Common Future is acknowledged as the singular book that made Agenda 21 possible in 1992.
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:04.600]  And here we are today, we have it today.
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:10.600]  So, you know, we look at these policies over time in history, we say we know exactly where they came from.
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:14.600]  There's no doubt, not one shred of doubt where these policies came from,
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:17.600]  and there's not one shred of doubt as to what they're doing today.
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:23.600]  They're trying to take over the entire means of production and consumption on a global basis.
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:25.600]  That's it.
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:30.600]  Everything they're doing meets the original requirements of technocracy that were written down in 1934.
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:32.600]  That's incredible to think, but it does.
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:38.600]  All the total awareness society, all the stuff about smart grid, all the stuff about Common Core,
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:43.600]  all the stuff about land use and abuse around our country and around the world,
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:51.600]  all of these things are tied directly to technocracy and the implementation of technocracy.
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:57.600]  That's right, and in all the tribalism the British played folks off in India and China and in the Americas,
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:01.600]  and about Bastion and British, they just used to fight and conquer, like Rome did.
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:09.600]  All of that now is a sideshow to the fact that our food, our water, our culture, everything is being Trojan horse.
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:12.600]  We are being engineered, we are being manipulated through GMO.
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:14.600]  That it's getting into our DNA.
[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:15.600]  We are mutating in a bad way.
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:17.600]  Our IQs are dropping.
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:25.600]  We are in the beginning stages, the beginning clutches of a technological woodchipper,
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:27.600]  and we just lost the Skype with our guest.
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:29.600]  I'm trying to get him back and say bye to him.
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:31.600]  We'll reconnect right now.
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:33.600]  His Skype did just come back.
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:37.600]  The book, Technocracy Rising, the Trojan Horse of Global Transformation.
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:40.600]  We're going to buy a bunch of your books, sir, and carry them in infowarstore.com.
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:43.600]  Where's the best place for people to find a Technocracy Rising?
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:47.600]  Well, technocracy.news is my current website.
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:53.600]  All of my previous websites are now wrapped into one single website, technocracy.news.
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:56.600]  You decide to go all out against this because this is the...
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:57.600]  I am. I am.
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:03.600]  I've dropped the love of my life, if you will, with economic forecasting and market forecasting,
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:07.600]  and I'm diving into this, Alex, because there is nothing more important than this.
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:09.600]  This is the big one.
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:11.600]  If we miss this, we've missed everything.
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:14.600]  Well, I know that you and Sutton pioneered exposing the enemy's operation,
[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:18.600]  plus they wrote books at many in the 70s and kind of launched this new term
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:22.600]  from the 30s on the backs of previous social Darwinism and feudalist models
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:26.600]  with a high-tech overlay, but I hope that in your research and experience,
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:29.600]  our work here at InfoWars with our listeners and everybody
[02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:32.600]  has helped you reach more of the public and has helped raise awareness,
[02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:36.600]  because I could not concur enough that this is undoubtedly, in their own words,
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:43.600]  the global takeover program and system, and it is absolutely discriminatory.
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:45.600]  It creates a permanent breakaway civilization.
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:49.600]  Forget a breakaway superclass or an upper class.
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:52.600]  This is the ultimate classism in their own words.
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:55.600]  It is the equivalent of an alien invasion.
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:58.600]  I'm not saying they're aliens, but they see themselves, and as you know,
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:01.600]  you've researched them as a breakaway species better than us,
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:04.600]  and that they're breaking away using our resources, our funds,
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:08.600]  our best and brightest working class and middle class brains
[02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:12.600]  to build their Elysium, and they just need to know
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:14.600]  we're going to have a public debate about it,
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:16.600]  and we're going to have a public debate about how global government
[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:19.600]  is meant to implement this, and if there is a debate about it,
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:23.600]  it's so discriminatory, so evil, there's no way they're going to get away with it.
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:27.600]  They need to be challenged, and I agree.
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:30.600]  There's no reason they say they should get away with it.
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:35.600]  They have no, their whole model is cracked,
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:39.600]  and yet, if we don't challenge it, they will stand and we will fall.
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:44.600]  Does it scare you, if you're children and if you're family, to think?
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:47.600]  Because most people think it's an intellectual or it's a real patriot,
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:50.600]  not a pseudo, that, oh, it's fun to be the trailblazer,
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:53.600]  it's fun to be one of the few that really knows what's going on.
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:55.600]  There's a lot of folks think they know what's going on,
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:57.600]  but I mean, we're right, this is the elites on words, they're playing.
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:02.600]  We're here with the enemy's blueprint, we see them implementing it over 30, 40 years,
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:07.600]  integrating all their previous systems into it, this is the most important thing out there.
[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:12.600]  And people are like, ah, I mean, is it scary to know this and to think
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:14.600]  there's not many of us that know this?
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:18.600]  Because I want everybody to hear me now, this is so important.
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:24.600]  It is disturbing that more people don't pick up on this,
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:28.600]  but we don't need 100% of the people, you know, maybe only 3% of the people
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:31.600]  would be enough probably to turn this thing on its head.
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:38.600]  I'd be happy with 3% or 5% of, you know, a passive and aggressive patriots
[02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:40.600]  who would go after this stuff.
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:44.600]  You see the rollout and all the Trojan horse stuff in the equipment, it's just insane.
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:46.600]  And again, we're going from nobody knowing this,
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:49.600]  but thanks to you and Sutton and others, tens of millions knowing,
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:52.600]  it's just time for people to realize you must fight the technocracy.
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:57.600]  It is the artificial manipulation and control and mass engineered hacking
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:03.600]  at birth of the devices and the systems to totally rig the entire world.
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:07.600]  They've rigged the stock market, they've rigged the forex, the currency,
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:11.600]  they've rigged the LIBOR currencies, the LIBOR interest rates,
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:13.600]  and now they want to rig the species itself.
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:17.600]  Is that not a good way to boil it down?
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:20.600]  It is a final corporate takeover.
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:27.600]  That's about it. And I want to point out that you cannot win over an enemy you do not know.
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:31.600]  We fought over the 40 years, we fought communism, fascism, socialism,
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:36.600]  every ism under the sun, we fought them all.
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:40.600]  Billions of hours have been spent by good men and women fighting these things
[02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:44.600]  and they fought the wrong enemy all this time.
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:47.600]  That's right, notice we're fighting communism, socialism, fascism,
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:51.600]  and then quickly they're top globalists on words, they all control all sides of that.
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:55.600]  But notice we're fighting a idiocracy, we're fighting a technocracy,
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:49:59.600]  we're fighting a dystopia, I mean that's really what they're doing.
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:01.600]  That's right, that's right.
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:04.600]  We need to see the enemy for who it is and who they are
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:09.600]  and what the system is as an enemy and that's what we need to fight.
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:16.600]  And the good news is it is possible to fight that because these people are within our grasp.
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:20.600]  We can find it, we can discover who they are, we can discover the policies
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:23.600]  and stuff in our own local communities and go in and challenge them.
[02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:26.600]  I want to have you back up, I want to have you back up for a full hour.
[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:29.600]  It's a synopsis of a battle plan.
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:33.600]  You've got the stoppage of the 21 and the technocrats behind it in the next few weeks
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:36.600]  so we're going to have you back on. Patrick M. Wood, thank you so much sir.
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:38.600]  You're welcome Alex, thank you.
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:41.600]  And folks if you want to know why this is such an in game,
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:45.600]  once they have all robots and autonomous systems, the troops say no to tyranny, they don't care.
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:50.600]  It takes human decision making out of the process for 99.9% of us
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:51:19.600]  and the Googles and the apples and the Microsofts are at the heads of the technocracy with an organized UN plan.
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:23.600]  Part and Body Extract talks about the positive effects of heart and body extract.
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:28.600]  What happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins,
[02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:33.600]  minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:39.600]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:43.600]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:48.600]  So the body is an amazing thing, it simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:50.600]  Part and Body Extract gets results.
